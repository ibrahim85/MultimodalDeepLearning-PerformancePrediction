2016-10-01<;>Ok. Orioles lose. Blue Jays and Tigers starting now. An M's win and at worst they need a win tomorrow and a loss by either Tor or Bal.<;>

2016-10-01<;>I love Buck. Hate questioning him but Miley isn't Steve Carlton. I'm screaming to get him out of there when trouble began in 6th. #Orioles<;>
2016-10-01<;>Yankees are pouring it on against the Orioles . Were down 3-1 and they now lead 7-3 in the 8th.<;>

2016-10-01<;>Every time the Orioles find themselves in the driver's seat, they end up in the ditch. It's uncanny.<;>
2016-10-01<;>If the Yankees hold this 5-3 lead, then the Wildcard standings would be: Orioles 88-73, Toronto 87-73, Tigers 86-73, SEA 86-74.<;>

2016-10-01<;>Really strange to see Miley still in this game in the seventh. It's not mid-June, is it? Bullpen wasn't taxed last night, either. #Orioles<;>
2016-10-01<;>The Orioles win in spite of Buck. another horrible decision to allow Miley to start the 7th with a fresh pen. Horrible, horrible managing.<;>
2016-10-01<;>When Jim Hunter says an Orioles pitcher has lost it, a pitching change is long overdue.<;>
2016-10-01<;>Wade Miley back out in the 7th. Nolan Reimold enters the game in left field. #Orioles up 3-2. #Birdland<;>
2016-10-01<;>And look what happened. Leadoff HR for Tyler Austin and we're tied #Orioles<;>
2016-10-01<;>Surprised Miley is back out for the 7th #orioles<;>
2016-10-01<;>Miley: 6 innings, 7 hits, 2 runs, 1 walk, 9 strikeouts, WP. 99/67. Time to pass the baton #orioles<;>

2016-09-29<;>#Orioles win another rubber game. Win 2 of 3 in Tor. NewBaldo looks even newer. O's play like NL team. Kim another big hit! C U in Fun City<;>

2016-09-29<;>#BlueJays Gibbons on loss in finale to #Orioles : "Stroman pitched a nice ballgame but we couldn't get anything going"<;>
2016-09-29<;>Ubaldo Jimenez since the Orioles reworked his delivery in mid-August: 7 GS, 2.45 ERA, 0.86 WHIP, 5 quality starts, team 5-2 in his starts<;>
2016-09-29<;>If TOR goes to BOS playing as lackluster as they've been & @orioles go to NY playing better ball as they've been...O's WILL host a WC game.<;>
2016-09-29<;>Another huge win for the Birds! Vote for tonight's @Carefirst #Orioles Player of the Game. #IBackTheBirds<;>

2016-09-29<;>Once again, soon after being declared dead, the Orioles have rebounded strongly and are on the verge of their fifth win in last six games.<;>

2016-09-29<;>Yankees lead the Red Sox 4-1, but the Orioles are up 4-0 on Toronto. A Baltimore win eliminates the Yanks.<;>

2016-09-29<;>In a race this close little things matter. So far tonight #Orioles are doing the little things better than #BlueJays .<;>
2016-09-29<;>RBI single by Matt Wieters. Trumbo scores. #Orioles lead 4-0 in the 8th. Stroman is done for the night. pic.twitter.com/lWFgbaidL8<;>

2016-09-29<;>Mark Trumbo double, Matt Wieters RBI single and it's 4-0 #Orioles T8. Aaron Loup is in for Marcus Stroman, who's facing a hard-luck L<;>
2016-09-29<;>Jiménez had a huge night! His final line: 6.2 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 3 BB, 5 Ks. (116 pitches) #Clutch pic.twitter.com/uv6QEAFyVT<;>
2016-09-29<;>I can't see too well, was that Ubaldo Jimenez out there throwing a clutch gem? #Orioles pic.twitter.com/rQETfJV3xH<;>
2016-09-29<;>What's worse, getups @MiamiDolphins are wearing tonight, or these monochrome @Orioles uniforms? pic.twitter.com/zNqv95wmUa<;>
2016-09-29<;>Donnie Hart replaces Jiménez with a 3-0 lead in the 7th. #Birdland<;>
2016-09-29<;>Play is overturned and the Orioles get the second out. Jimenez is done for the night. Here comes Hart.<;>
2016-09-29<;>Ubaldo was absolutely dealing tonight when #Orioles needed him most<;>
2016-09-29<;>Who's still with the Blue Jays and me tonight??? #BlueJays 0 #Orioles 3 B7<;>
2016-09-29<;>Can't see Yankees pulling for Jays to make playoffs. Don't expect much of a fight from them when the take on Orioles next three.<;>
2016-09-29<;>It's all coming up Ubaldo. He gets the replay call and gets the hook from Buck after 7 2/3 innings and ONE HIT. #orioles<;>
2016-09-29<;>Bourn walks , steals 2nd , then scores on a single by who? HYUN SOO KIM of course! 3-0 #Orioles in the 7th!<;>
2016-09-29<;>https:// vimeo.com/173065076 #orioles<;>
2016-09-29<;>So the #BlueJays will need to score at least 4 runs off the Orioles bullpen to win tonight.<;>
2016-09-29<;>So, what were the odds that Ubaldo and Kim would be heroes of the final week of the season? #orioles<;>
2016-09-29<;>Attention. An Orioles batter just drew a leadoff walk and then immediately stole second base. Who are these people in O's uniforms tonight?<;>
2016-09-29<;>Hyun-soo Kim: #Orioles hero and legend.<;>
2016-09-29<;>NewBaldo is mowing em down!6 straight early....11 straight into the 6th inn. Has 2-0 lead in Toronto. No HRs... #orioles R on S F & grounder<;>
2016-09-29<;>The waiver wire pickup of Not Awful Ubaldo Jimenez on August 25 was really a slick move by the Orioles .<;>
2016-09-29<;>OMG! JOSE BAUTISTA HIT A BALL IN THE AIR! Fly ball to end the sixth. 2-0 Orioles .<;>
2016-09-29<;>We're up 2-0 through 5! Manny RBI Bourn RBI Jiménez 5 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 2 BB, 3 Ks. pic.twitter.com/WZbLxVZbO9<;>
2016-09-29<;>Ubaldo masterful , but pitch count mounting. His way of shutting teams down #penalert @masnOrioles @Orioles<;>
2016-09-29<;>Obviously you’d prefer the Orioles win, but if the Tigers can’t sweep Atlanta and beat a simulated Indians team, they don’t deserve it.<;>
2016-09-29<;>The best acquisition at the trade deadline was the Orioles acquiring this new Ubaldo Jimenez<;>

2016-09-27<;>The #Astros win, they are now 2.5 games back behind the Orioles . While it's unlikely, they still have a chance with four games remaining.<;>
2016-09-27<;>If #BlueJays win next 2 home games vs. #Orioles Toronto will clinch an AL wild-card spot before heading to Boston for weekend series.<;>
2016-09-27<;>The Orioles lost today, so the Royals are technically alive for the post-season for another day.<;>

2016-09-23<;>This one is going to extras. @Zbritton will pitch the 10th. #LetsGoOs #Birdland<;>
2016-09-23<;>Terribly managed inning by Buck. How do you PH for 1 of your best hitters and not PR for 1 of your slowest runners? #orioles<;>
2016-09-23<;>Thanks to everyone who came out and supported the Orioles tonight<;>
2016-09-23<;>So yes, the #orioles do have a beef with Welington<;>
2016-09-23<;>Machado walks. 2 on, 2 outs for Davis, who's trying to prevent free baseball #orioles<;>
2016-09-23<;>HE WAS BLOCKING THE WHOLE PLATE! GTFOH @ORIOLES<;>
2016-09-23<;>Hardy still ruled out. If that's not blocking the plate, not sure what qualifies #orioles<;>
2016-09-23<;>#Orioles potential winning run called out at the plate... IT'S UNDER REVIEW...<;>
2016-09-23<;>The ruling on the field stands. Hardy is out. Jones remains on second with Machado up and two outs. #Birdland<;>
2016-09-23<;>Matt Wieters ties the game for the @Orioles in the 9th! It's his 1st career game-tying HR in 9th inning or later.<;>
2016-09-23<;>With Hardy on 2nd, Jones singles. Hardy is called out at the plate, but the play is under review. #Birdland<;>
2016-09-23<;>Should Buck have pinch-run for Hardy? Should Dickerson have sent Hardy? Did catcher block the plate? #orioles<;>

2016-09-21<;>Orioles lose to Red Sox, 5-1, so Mariners are now just two out of second Wild Card spot with 10 games remaining.<;>
2016-09-21<;>Man the Orioles really took a big fat stinky poop all over this series<;>
2016-09-21<;>With two outs in the top of the 9th, Buck replaces Duensing with Mike Wright. Score remains 5-1 Boston. #Birdland<;>
2016-09-21<;>If this holds, it will be 60 innings since the Orioles last scored more than two runs in an inning. (1st inning on Thursday.)<;>
2016-09-21<;>I still think there's a legitimate chance the Orioles make the postseason. But every loss stings a bit more each time.<;>

2016-09-21<;>I can't believe the Orioles were trying to get my hopes up all this time, lmaoo.<;>
2016-09-21<;>I wonder if there is an advanced metric for what the Orioles just did to themselves.<;>
2016-09-21<;>Unless/until @Orioles score more runs v Buchholz (5.20 ERA) the error & Benitendi HR are secondary. O's aren't scoring. Can't win w/o runs.<;>
