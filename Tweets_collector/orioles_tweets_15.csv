2015-09-30<;>Donaldson takes one off the top of the RF wall for an RBI double. 8-0 #Bluejays top5. #Clinchmaka is a fun day indeed! #Jays #Orioles<;>
2015-09-30<;>#Orioles baseball.... Where's the circus music? 22 errors already in September.<;>
2015-09-30<;>Jays hit ball to pitcher. Orioles send ball on journey of discovery across the United States, where it learns about itself. Three runs score<;>
2015-09-30<;>With the O's trailing 7-0, Garcia is replaced by Mike Wright with 2 outs and runner at second in the 5th. #Birdland<;>
2015-09-30<;>The Orioles are throwing the ball around like Joe Flacco the past three weeks.<;>
2015-09-30<;>Yes there are more @Bluejays fans there than orioles fans. It's lucky 7-0 for the good guys. AL East Champs? You bet. pic.twitter.com/yz4wFuSaW5<;>
2015-09-30<;>The #BlueJays now lead 7-0 after 3 runs score on 2 #Orioles errors in the top of the 5th inning. #Jays<;>
2015-09-30<;>Never change Orioles .<;>
2015-09-30<;>The #Orioles apparently don't have any interest in delaying the inevitable.They're handing the division crown to Toronto on a silver platter<;>
2015-09-30<;>If your watching this @Orioles game (& I imagine many aren't) it's pretty clear which team is playing to clinch a division...& which isn't.<;>
2015-09-30<;>Thanks Orioles for the errors .<;>
2015-09-30<;>The Orioles really seem OK with Toronto winning the American League East<;>
2015-09-30<;>Stroman squashes #Orioles 2out rally by getting Pearce to ground to 3B. #Bluejays up 4-0 to the 5th! #Jays<;>

2015-09-30<;>Jose Bautista draws a bases loaded walk, extending the #BlueJays lead to 4-0 in the top of the 4th inning on the #Orioles .<;>
2015-09-30<;>Bases loaded walk to Joseph W. makes it 4-0 #Bluejays and leaves them juiced for Edwin and his parrot. #Jays #Orioles<;>
2015-09-30<;>Edwin pops up, so #Bluejays leave bases loaded in top4, but score a pair. #Jays lead #Orioles 4-0.<;>
2015-09-30<;>. @MStrooo6 sends the Orioles down in order to end the 3rd. It’s still 2-0 as the @BlueJays bat in the 4th.<;>
2015-09-30<;>The joys of post-elimination baseball: the Orioles broadcast has been talking about mariachi music for more than five minutes.<;>
2015-09-30<;>After three innings, Orioles trail Blue Jays, 2-0. #Birdland<;>
2015-09-30<;>Miguel Gonzalez K's Bautista for his 417th career strikeout, giving him sole possession of 20th place among Mexican-born pitchers.<;>

2015-09-30<;>Ryan Goins singles home Russ Martin & gives the #BlueJays a 2-0 lead on the #Orioles in the top of the 2nd inning. #Jays<;>
2015-09-30<;>How is barely anyone at the Orioles game? If only it was Toronto... What a waste.<;>
2015-09-30<;>Stroman gets out of it, as Schoop grounds in front of the plate. 0-0 to the 2nd! #Bluejays #Jays #Orioles<;>
2015-09-30<;>Unofficially, more #bluejays fans than Orioles fans tonite in Baltimore. Or sure seems that way. #cbc #cbcsports pic.twitter.com/6h088rmgpn<;>

2015-09-11<;>Clevenger GRAND SLAM! 2 GRAND SLAMS IN THE SAME INNING! #Orioles now lead the Royals 14-6! #RoyalRevenge<;>
2015-09-11<;>Orioles booth now openly calling this game revenge for the ALCS. Ok honey, if it makes you feel better. #Royals<;>
2015-09-11<;>Greatest half inning I've seen in my life probably. #MLB #CamdenYards #Orioles #Royals<;>
2015-09-11<;>The #Orioles trailed 6-4 when the bottom of the 8th started. They now lead 14-6<;>
2015-09-11<;>Breaking: The Royals have been murdered as the Orioles have scored 10 runs in the bottom of the 8th (HR & 2 GS)<;>
2015-09-11<;>Steve Clevenger - Baltimore Orioles (2) Grand Slam<;>
2015-09-11<;>This is unreal. Glad a great crowd gets that kind of reward for this kind of season. #Orioles<;>
2015-09-11<;>That was also @Clev_45 's first career grand slam. #Birdland<;>
2015-09-11<;>#orioles with 2 TDs.<;>
2015-09-11<;>1st career grand slam for Clevenger, #orioles 6th this season<;>
2015-09-11<;>Goodbye, grand slam AGAIN! Steve Clevenger notches the Orioles second grand slam of the inning. #Orioles now lead 14-6. #Birdland<;>
2015-09-11<;>2 grand slams in 1 inning. Is that good? #orioles<;>
2015-09-11<;>Sorry for a baseball intervention, but the #Orioles just hit their second grand slam of the INNING. Wow<;>
2015-09-11<;>Schoop walks in his second at-bat of the inning. Bases are loaded again. Clevenger up, one out. #Birdland<;>
2015-09-11<;>When Chris Davis and Buck Showalter read that I think #Orioles would be wise not to bring Davis back: https:// vine.co/v/eFMzeEr9FAA .<;>
2015-09-11<;>I suspect, at some point, this inning will end, perhaps due to sheer fatigue from Orioles hitters at having to hit so much.<;>
2015-09-11<;>The Orioles had a great come back and the Royals figured they would peg people like the Yankees. Poor sportsmanship. Umpires suck too<;>
2015-09-11<;>It's good to have Orioles Twitter back. Feels like 2014 tonight<;>
2015-09-11<;>BTW, there's still only 1 out, runners on 2nd and 3rd, #orioles up 10-6 and Joba Chamberlain is pitching. 10th batter of inning up<;>
2015-09-11<;>Steve Pearce doubles, Jones scores. Now 10-6 Orioles . #Birdland<;>
2015-09-11<;>And that is why we love Buck! Great theater at Camden Yards. #Orioles<;>
2015-09-11<;>Pearce hits a double, somehow. A run scores. This game has devolved. 10-6, Orioles .<;>
2015-09-11<;>Crush and Buck angry. #Orioles https:// vine.co/v/eFMzeEr9FAA<;>
2015-09-11<;>Buck Showalter has been ejected by HP umpire Mark Carlson following Chris Davis hit by pitch in the 8th.<;>
2015-09-11<;>That bat died a hero. #Orioles https:// twitter.com/datkinsonou/st atus/642527710603014144 …<;>
2015-09-11<;>#Orioles get a Grand Slam against #Royals and then Chris Davis gets drilled. With these two teams? Whoda thunk it?<;>
2015-09-11<;>Jones singles, Davis HBP and slams bat to ground. Buck rushes out to make sure Davis goes to 1B. Davis furious #orioles<;>
2015-09-11<;>Ryan Lefebvre about Buck Showalter before the ejection: "Get off the field!" #Royals #ForeverRoyal #Orioles<;>
2015-09-11<;>And Manny Machado adds another home run for good measure, his 28th of the season! #Orioles 9, Royals 6 in the 8th. #Birdland<;>
2015-09-11<;>It's come about 11 months too late, but even now it feels good to see the Orioles light up the Royals bullpen.<;>
2015-09-11<;>And now Machado homers off Franklin Morales #orioles<;>
2015-09-11<;>@Orioles JUST WIN THESE GAMES MAN CHRIST<;>

2015-09-11<;>Goodbye, grand slam! Nolan Reimold comes through in the clutch with one out in the 8th and O's trailing. Birds now lead, 8-6. #Birdland<;>
2015-09-11<;>That's Nolan Reimold's first career grand slam. #Birdland<;>
2015-09-11<;>So... There's that big hit we needed! #GrandSlam #ReimTime #Orioles<;>

2015-09-06<;>I was going to watch the rest of this #Orioles game, then I decided I'd rather give myself a papercut and pour lemon juice on it.<;>
2015-09-06<;>Where the HELL was the pitcher throwing at?? LOL #Orioles Encarnacion drives home Bautista, 9-3 Jays in the 6th #BreathingRoom :)<;>
2015-09-06<;>Paredes doubles home @SimplyAJ10 and the #Orioles have cut the deficit to 6-3!<;>
2015-09-06<;>The Orioles are not scared. Impressed. Intrigued. #BlueJays<;>
2015-09-06<;>Let's just celebrate Ripken and the streak. No need for analysis. #Orioles http://www. baseballessential.com/news/2015/09/0 6/cal-ripkens-streak-celebrated-analyzed/ …<;>
2015-09-06<;>. @LaTroyHawkins32 on to pitch the 6th inning with the @BlueJays leading the Orioles 6-2<;>
2015-09-06<;>. @RFlaherty3 gets us on the board with a 2-run shot! His 7th of the year makes it a 6-2 Blue Jays lead. #Orioles<;>
2015-09-06<;>Brian Matusz comes on and records the final out of the 5th. Heart of the #Orioles order due up to start the 6th, looking to rally.<;>
2015-09-06<;>Ryan Flaherty - Baltimore Orioles (7) 2-run<;>
2015-09-06<;>only silver lining I can offer is that next week NFL games that count will be on to distract us from this disappointing #Orioles season<;>
2015-09-06<;>15.50 ERA against the Blue Jays does Tillman have. #yoda #bluejays #orioles<;>
2015-09-06<;>Kevin Pillar, solo job, No. 10, #BlueJays lead #Orioles 6-0 B4<;>
2015-09-06<;>. @SJohnson831 is in to pitch in the 4th for the #Orioles with the Blue Jays leading 6-0.<;>
2015-09-06<;>Okay #BlueJays - let's not completely destroy the #Orioles bullpen. They start a series against the #Yankees tomorrow. @BJsFans<;>
2015-09-06<;>After 3 innings in Toronto, Blue Jays lead 5-0. #Orioles<;>
2015-09-06<;>@Orioles re-sign Davis<;>
2015-09-06<;>After three innings of play the #BlueJays lead the #Orioles 5-0.<;>
2015-09-06<;>Troy Tulowitzki, two-run shot, #BlueJays lead #Orioles 5-0 B3<;>
2015-09-06<;>Tulowitzki with a massive belt to LF, 2-run is his 17th of the season, 5th as a #Bluejays - now 5-0 #Jays over #Orioles bot3.<;>
2015-09-06<;>Tulowitzki hits a two-run home run to give the #BlueJays a 5-0 lead over the #Orioles in the bottom of the third inning.<;>

2015-09-02<;>that casino claims orioles ' odds to win WS r 100-1. i hope they arent really booking bets on this. thats known as stealing.<;>
2015-09-02<;>#CRUSHED !<;>
2015-09-02<;>. @88_gparra doubles to RF and Machado books it around the bases to score from first. #Orioles trail 4-2. #Birdland<;>
2015-09-02<;>Chris Davis - Baltimore Orioles (37) 2-run<;>
2015-09-02<;>The O's lead the majors with 41 OF assists. This guy has 14 of them. Watch: http:// atmlb.com/1KJBFqP @simplyaj10 pic.twitter.com/bGauglESjM<;>
2015-09-02<;>as if it isnt enough orioles have lost 12 of 13 and are down 4-0 tonite, their next 3 series are against NYY, TOR and KC.<;>
2015-09-02<;>Pearce doubles then tags up on Flaherty's high fly to LF, Machado brings him home with a single to center. #Orioles on the board. #Birdland<;>
2015-09-02<;>4-6-3 and we're on to the bottom of the 3rd. Pearce, Flaherty, and Machado due up. #Birdland<;>

2015-09-02<;>To make matters worse for the Orioles the umps can't even get a home run call right with video review. Home run was foul all the way<;>

2015-09-02<;>Two weeks ago, Henry Urrutia ended a game with a home run. It's hard to fathom these last two weeks. #Orioles #OriolesTalk<;>
2015-09-02<;>The Orioles ' luck is so bad right now that fouls count as home runs. Good stuff.<;>
2015-09-02<;>After a crew chief review of 3 min 45 sec, the home run call stands. #Orioles are down 1-0 in the 3rd. #Birdland<;>

2015-08-23<;>The Orioles lost 3 straight 1 run games, the last 2 thanks to a rash of bloops and INF hits - yipes<;>
2015-08-23<;>2012: Win WC, lose ALDS. 2013: Miss playoffs. 2014: Win ALDS, lose ALCS. If #Orioles miss playoffs this year, they'll win WS in 2018.<;>
2015-08-23<;>Tampa Bay 2.5 games back from the last wildcard spot And #Orioles are 2 games back! Everyone is still in it! #TheTriplePlay<;>

2015-08-23<;>What a great comeback win for the Twins today over the Orioles . The bullpen did a great job throughout the 4-game sweep!<;>
2015-08-23<;>#Orioles had been 51-1 when leading after 7 innings coming into this series. They are now 51-3.<;>
2015-08-23<;>if the Orioles win the series against the Royals I'll change to a Ryan Flaherty toon and make my header TJ McFarland<;>

2015-08-23<;>If #Orioles miss the playoffs they can blame the #Twins , losing all 7 games vs them this year.<;>
2015-08-23<;>Gonna have to avoid the Orioles for like a week straight to keep my sanity<;>
2015-08-23<;>I can't speak to where #Orioles will be a week from now but right now they don't look like a very good baseball team.<;>
2015-08-23<;>This team continues to have stretches where they have trouble scoring. You can't win consistently in 2015 scoring 3 runs a game #Orioles<;>
2015-08-23<;>The #MNTwins bullpen contributed 7.1 IP this afternoon. The #Orioles were held scoreless and K'd 7 times in that span<;>
2015-08-23<;>Remember how bad #Bluejays made #Twins look earlier this month? Minny just swept #Orioles 4 straight as part of a 7-0 season sweep.<;>
2015-08-23<;>#orioles go 0-7 vs. #twins this season<;>
2015-08-23<;>#orioles go 5-5 on the homestand.<;>
2015-08-23<;>#TwinsWin ! 4-3 final in 12 innings over the Orioles . The #MNTwins sweep the 4-game series and go 7-0 in the season series v. Baltimore.<;>
2015-08-23<;>Final: Orioles drop finale to Twins, 4-3 in 12 innings.<;>
2015-08-23<;>Unreal. Twins win in 12 innings, complete 4-game sweep of the Orioles after looking dead in the water after Yankees sweep.<;>
2015-08-23<;>#Orioles trail, 4-3 in the bottom of the 12th. #Birdland<;>
2015-08-23<;>Baseball is funny. If Rosario doesn't drop that foul, Hardy never gets to 2nd & Machado stays at 3rd & Paredes on the bench #Orioles #Twins<;>
2015-08-23<;>What a disaster series for the Orioles<;>
2015-08-23<;>Kind of wishing Mike Zimmer managed the Orioles right now just to see his reaction to this #MNTwins 12th inning. #bleepitybleepitybleep<;>
2015-08-23<;>The Orioles are really good at pissing me off<;>
2015-08-23<;>if the Orioles were the grizz softball team they would have a lot of Ronny D to drink<;>
2015-08-23<;>The Twins score on an error. #Orioles trail 4-3 in the 12th.<;>
2015-08-23<;>ORIOLES DEFENSE<;>
2015-08-23<;>Paredes with error at 3B and run scores. Robinson bouncer off his glove. Ball seems to find him #orioles<;>
2015-08-23<;>This is Manny Machado's major league debut at shortstop. #Birdland<;>
2015-08-23<;>Machado will play shortstop and Paredes third in the top of the 12th. Brian Matusz will take over on the mound. #Birdland<;>
2015-08-23<;>Parra singles. Paredes will pinch-run for Hardy at second. Adam Jones up. #Birdland<;>

2015-08-23<;>Schoop brings them home! Jonathan's 2-run single scores Jones & Clevenger. Schoop advances to 2nd on the throw. #Orioles take a 3-2 lead.<;>
2015-08-23<;>BIRDS TAKE THE LEAD! Schoop's two-run single puts the #Orioles up 3-2 in the fifth. #TopTheTwins<;>
2015-08-23<;>Clevenger's ground-rule double gives him a career-high 7-game hitting streak. Jones to third. #Birdland<;>
2015-08-23<;>Cruising! Gausman has retired 13 in a row as the #Orioles trail the Twins 2-1 heading into the bottom of the fifth.<;>
2015-08-23<;>2-run single for Schoop. He's driven in all 3 #orioles runs. Again to RF. O's lead 3-2 in 5th<;>

2015-08-23<;>Parra double followed by Jones fly ball and Davis' 2nd strikeout of day. #orioles<;>
2015-08-23<;>After two innings, #Orioles trail, 2-0. #Birdland<;>
2015-08-23<;>David Lough outrighted to AAA Norfolk #orioles<;>
2015-08-23<;>Apparently Chris "Crush" Davis of the Baltimore Orioles has our song, How Sweet The Sound as his walk up song! Thanks Chris! @Orioles<;>
2015-08-23<;>Teams will always have failed prospects of course, but the amount of failed Orioles top pitching prospects is ridiculous.<;>
2015-08-23<;>#orioles have runners on the corners and 1 out in 1st after singles by Machado and Jones<;>
2015-08-23<;>Might actually consider watching preseason football with the Orioles being this trash.<;>

2015-07-24<;>How rare was Rays' comeback Friday in 3-1 win over Orioles ? Tampa Bay had been 1-38 this season when trailing after seven innings ...<;>

2015-07-23<;>Orioles home runs 1. Are always solo shots 2. Come when we're already losing by 4+ runs 3. Are the only way we score nowadays<;>
2015-07-23<;>Yankees making a pitching change with 2 outs in the 9th and #orioles down 9-3. Really. They are<;>

2015-07-23<;>I honestly think the worst #Orioles can do at the deadline is nothing. Seller? Buyer? Pick one, create a plan, and don't sit on your hands.<;>
2015-07-23<;>Well the Orioles will likely be swept by the Yankees today. Losing 9 to 1. All the Orioles can do is sleep and try again tomorrow.<;>
2015-07-23<;>#Yankees batters are 11-for-25 (.440) through 5 innings of work against the Orioles . #NYY 's 6-9 hitters are 8-for-12. #YANKSonYES<;>
2015-07-23<;>The Orioles haven't helped themselves by stinking today, but man, some of these plays are like, "The AI decides you're not winning" level.<;>
2015-07-23<;>The last time the Yankees swept the Orioles was April 9 to 11 in 2012.<;>
2015-07-23<;>The Orioles need somebody to open the sprinkler system to end this ugliness.<;>
2015-07-23<;>#Yankees dumping on the #Orioles !!! 9-1!!! I smell a sweep!!!!<;>
2015-07-23<;>#Orioles look horrendous today. Should be a great matchup at the Trop this weekend vs the #Rays . Stoppable force vs Moveable object<;>
2015-07-23<;>Bud Norris comes on for Tommy Hunter, who pitched 1.2 innings of relief.<;>
2015-07-23<;>Tanaka has retired 12 of 13 Orioles since Davis' homer, the lone exception coming on Gardner's error.<;>
2015-07-23<;>I would say this is rock bottom for the #Orioles , but who really knows at this point?<;>
2015-07-23<;>Where's the whistle sound for that play? #orioles<;>
2015-07-23<;>Summary of Orioles : pic.twitter.com/VqCg3yoJQm<;>
2015-07-23<;>Hunter has retired all 5 batters faced with 3 strikeouts #orioles<;>
2015-07-23<;>Orioles comeback would require some plate discipline and some baserunners. Don't get your hopes up.<;>
2015-07-23<;>@Orioles wasn't aware this was a comedy account<;>
2015-07-23<;>Sooooo - if you aren't doing anything but bashing & whining right now you are just proving how shallow you are. #Orioles #IBackTheBirds<;>
2015-07-23<;>This series really could not have gone any worse for the Orioles as a team that wants to pretend they will contend.<;>
2015-07-23<;>Yankees score a pair in the 3rd. #Orioles look to start a rally batting in the 4th.<;>
2015-07-23<;>The Orioles were known for their amazing resilience the past three years. Not seeing anything like that now.<;>
2015-07-23<;>A loss today would give the #Orioles a 19-30 road record. Can't expect to contend when you play like a 100-loss club away from Camden Yards.<;>
2015-07-23<;>Sac fly for Ellsbury. Jimenez now charged with 7 runs. Same as his last outing in Detroit #orioles<;>

2015-07-23<;>The Orioles only need six more solo home runs to win this game.<;>
2015-07-23<;>Orioles Twitter used to be fun. Now, it's just sad and depressing.<;>
2015-07-23<;>A Jacoby Ellsbury solo homer extends the Yankees’ lead. #Orioles bat in the 3rd, trailing 5-1.<;>
2015-07-23<;>Ellsbury's first homer against the Orioles as a Yankee. He had 10 against them as a Red Sox.<;>
2015-07-23<;>In a perfectly irritating world, the Orioles would fight back to lose their third straight one-run game in the Bronx.<;>
2015-07-23<;>. @CrushD19 doing what he does best! Solo shot to right-center makes it a 4-1 game. #Orioles<;>

2015-07-17<;>. @tHunter29 comes on to pitch in relief in the 6th inning.<;>
2015-07-17<;>Mike Bordick just gave Sanchez credit for minimizing the damage. It was the Orioles brain-frozen offense that has minimized the damage.<;>
2015-07-17<;>Thank you for the tour @orioles and for my new hat! @ussoccer quarterfinal of #GoldCup2015 tomorrow… https:// instagram.com/p/5Qf9UGPP4x/<;>

2015-07-17<;>We trail 6-2 in the top of the 5th after Jose Iglesias’ 3-run homer.<;>
2015-07-17<;>I thought the All-Star Break would be good because I needed four days off from the Orioles . I was wrong. I need more.<;>
2015-07-17<;>Chris Parmelee beats out a grounder to bring us within 3-2. Jimenez is back in the bottom of the 4th. #Birdland<;>

2015-06-20<;>Darren O'Day could really help his pitch count by just asking to have three runners put on base before he starts an inning. #Orioles<;>
2015-06-20<;>O'Day strikes out the side, leaving the bases loaded in the 8th. Whoa. #Orioles and #BlueJays head to the ninth tied 2-2.<;>

2015-06-19<;>Final in Toronto: #BlueJays (37-32) beat #Orioles (34-33) by score of 5-4. W: Estrada (5-3) L: Wright (2-3) SV: Cecil (5) .. #MLB<;>
2015-06-19<;>Base hit for @SimplyAJ10 ! Two runs score, and now the #Orioles are down by just one run!<;>
2015-06-19<;>#Orioles de estar recibiendo No-Hitter en el 8vo, tienen el empate en 3B en el 9no. #BlueJays 5-4. Lío de pájaros!<;>
2015-06-19<;>I'd imagine that Bucknor didn't toss Cecil because he knows he's already gone too far tonight. #BlueJays #Orioles<;>
2015-06-19<;>The #Orioles are alive! The tying run is at the dish with 2 outs in the 9th! #BirdFight<;>
2015-06-19<;>The fact that play was even close is a testament to Donaldson. #BlueJays #MLB #Orioles<;>
2015-06-19<;>Most #Orioles fans on Twitter: Wright wasn't throwing at Bautista. Most #BlueJays fans: Osuna wasn't throwing at Jones. Everybody's innocent<;>
2015-06-19<;>This Blue Jays/ Orioles rivalry is reaching Blue Jays/A's level of the early 90's.<;>
2015-06-19<;>Buck Showalter needs to recognize when his team has had all the advantages and just sit the hell down. #BlueJays #Orioles<;>
2015-06-19<;>That's exactly what Orioles got called out for on Sunday. Bull if that's not reviewable. And he was so obviously not in base path too<;>
2015-06-19<;>#Orioles grab another run in the top of the 8th, cutting the deficit to 5-2. @tHunter29 is now on the mound.<;>
2015-06-19<;>Thorne just referred to Hardy as one of the Orioles ' hotter hitters. My wife concurs.<;>
2015-06-19<;>JJ Hardy pops out to short on 2-1 pitch, #BlueJays out of jam, take 5-2 lead to B8 with Tommy Hunter coming in for #Orioles<;>
2015-06-19<;>So, Jose Bautista hit by pitch in 1st inning; Adam Jones hit in eighth. Two #BlueJays coaches and one pitcher ejected; No Orioles ejected.<;>
2015-06-19<;>...and here, Osuna has 2 strikes on Jones and hits him to bring tying run to the plate. Not intentional. #Orioles #BlueJays<;>
2015-06-19<;>This #Orioles and #BlueJays feud has got to end. When it starts to ruin the game and lose its humour, its gone too far. @BJsFans<;>
2015-06-19<;>Complete and absolute bullshit. #BlueJays #Orioles<;>
2015-06-19<;>This Orioles -Blue Jays manufactured beef is downright stupid.<;>
2015-06-19<;>Stay classy Toronto #Orioles<;>
2015-06-19<;>#Orioles get on the board! RBI single for @CParms27!<;>

2015-05-12<;>Six of the eight errors committed by Manny Machado have been on throws. Out of character, but really starting to become a concern. #Orioles<;>

2015-04-22<;>#Orioles take issue with Bautista in #BlueJays win. Full story with Adam Jones' comments now up @sportsnet http://www. sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/o rioles-jones-bautista-reaction-uncalled-for/ …<;>
2015-04-22<;>Jose Bautista's full post-game scrum. Lots of great quotes. #bluejays #Orioles http:// youtu.be/EIi4o7h1QtY<;>
2015-04-22<;>Clearly both the #Orioles and Jays are very bitter how the whole Dan Duquette saga played out during the offseason.<;>
2015-04-21<;>Lost in the emotion of tonight is that the Orioles have allowed 20 runs and made 5 errors the last 2 days. Time to clean it up.<;>
2015-04-22<;>The Orioles threw behind Jose Bautista today on the next pitch he goes yard that's how you respond<;>
2015-04-22<;>So an Orioles pitcher threw behind Bautista. Then Adam Jones pointed at his head. Think someone will be suspended?<;>
2015-04-21<;>Jose Bautista on exchange with #Orioles : "At least I've gotten the last laugh the last two times." WATCH: http:// ow.ly/LWnD1<;>
2015-04-21<;>MODERN SEINFELD: Elaine wears Orioles cap to ballgame in Toronto. Jose Bautista (as himself) pile drives her.<;>
2015-04-21<;>¡Qué orgullo! Melvin Mora será exaltado al Salón de la Fama de los Orioles de Baltimore http:// ow.ly/LUHy3 #Deportes #Béisbol #MLB<;>
2015-04-21<;>Somebody give Jose Bautista a beat and let him drop a diss track against the Baltimore Orioles . Reyes can feature on it.<;>
2015-04-21<;>As the Orioles are reminding us, sports has an unwritten code so athletes can make it up as they go along.<;>
2015-04-21<;>What is it with the Orioles and asshat sluggers on other AL East teams? At least Evan Longoria seems like a chill dude<;>
2015-04-21<;>It's really something to see the completely different takes #Bluejays and #Orioles have on the incident. Both feel justified. Only #Jays are<;>
2015-04-21<;>#Orioles reliever Jason Garcia, who threw behind Jose Bautista tonight, is a Rule 5 pick who began last season in the New York-Penn League.<;>
2015-04-21<;>Bautista on #Orioles : "I think they act and hide behind the way their manager acts and conducts himself on the field." #MLB #BlueJays<;>
2015-04-21<;>Bautista still has no idea why the Orioles are throwing at them. "They hit Goins tonight. The guy has pin point control then hits him?"<;>
2015-04-21<;>Watch: Blue Jays' Jose Bautista hits HR after nearly being hit by pitch by Orioles http:// on.si.com/1yNHFdV pic.twitter.com/GMpba8o8qy<;>
2015-04-21<;>Bautista rips on #Orioles hypocrisy. Showalter's excuse is that Garcia is a rookie. This, after he slammed Stroman (rookie) for incident ly.<;>
2015-04-21<;>Jones:"I’m not going 2 let nobody show up my teammates in a situation like that when a guy is def not trying 2 hurt somebody." #orioles<;>
2015-04-21<;>Jones: "You’re not going to sit there and pimp me. You pimp the pitcher, you’re pimping me too." #Orioles<;>

2015-04-21<;>Orioles pretending Garcia's pitch was unintentional and that they were somehow wronged by Bautista is punk garbage from serious shitfucks.<;>
2015-04-21<;>Second time in two weeks the Orioles throw behind Bautista..... Twice he cranks it out, and now Showalter rips him for it? Clowns.<;>
2015-04-21<;>Lots of emotion in #Orioles clubhouse postgame. Players thought Bautista showing up Garcia, a 22 YO who hasn't pitched above A, was wrong.<;>

2015-04-21<;>hey @Orioles I mean throw behind @JoeyBats19 all you want he's just gonna keep hitting dingers. @BJsFans would agree<;>
2015-04-21<;>Fuck you so hard Orioles fucks. Hahahahaha.<;>
2015-04-21<;>Do not make Joseph W Bats angry. You wouldn't like him when he's angry. Stares down #Orioles dugout as he hits the plate. 13-4 #Bluejays<;>
2015-04-21<;>Fucking trash birds. Fuck you Orioles .<;>
2015-04-21<;>Garcia throws behind Bautista and, for some reason, HP umpire Mark Carlson warns both benches. That's not right. #Bluejays #Jays #Orioles<;>
2015-04-21<;>I don't see much of Kevin Pillar beyond games vs. #orioles but that's at least the 4th great play I've watched him make in LF in 2 weeks<;>
2015-04-21<;>Kevin Pillar has had an incredible to start to the season in LF. #BlueJays #MLB #Orioles<;>
2015-04-21<;>#Orioles trail 11-3 after 6 innings.<;>
2015-04-21<;>Encarnacion's blast is 18th all-time in SkyDome's/Rogers Centre's fifth deck. Second time for Encarnacion. #BlueJays #MLB #Orioles<;>

2015-04-21<;>Prior to that, Bruce's last grand slam was September 2, 2014 at Orioles . #Reds<;>
2015-04-21<;>Encarnacion: Fifth deck. #BlueJays #MLB #Orioles<;>
2015-04-21<;>Fact Young got in under that tag doesn't lessen the great play by Pillar to get that ball in. Good tag had him. #BlueJays #MLB #Orioles<;>
2015-04-21<;>Having Gausman in the bullpen is a luxury which most teams would kill for! It's time to make the switch - Norris is out of chances. #Orioles<;>
2015-04-21<;>Blue Jays, Raptors...go away Toronto teams. Like right now. #orioles #Wizards<;>
2015-04-21<;>This game is making me very grumpy #Orioles<;>

2015-04-18<;>To clarify, Buck said Schoop injury occurred when Schoop hit 1B bag awkwardly late in game, not from the hard slide from Sandoval. #orioles<;>
2015-04-18<;>So the other day I said Schoop might hit 30 homers now it's possible we may not see him in another game this season. Damn injuries #Orioles<;>

2015-04-17<;>It's pronounced Schoop. #Orioles pic.twitter.com/ywhM5KXxDA<;>
2015-04-17<;>Jordan Baker is one of baseball's least experienced umpires at 32. In his second fulltime season, and the tallest ump at 6-foot-7. #orioles<;>
2015-04-17<;>Unless those are Orioles fans sitting first row in right field, WHY ARE YOU GETTING IN THE WAY? C'mon people. Drink responsibly.<;>

2015-04-17<;>Caleb Joseph with his 1st HR of the season, an opposite field homer. Betts made a try for it, but couldnt get it. #Orioles up 2-0.<;>
2015-04-17<;>Caleb Joseph - Baltimore Orioles (1) Solo<;>
2015-04-17<;>Orioles pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez was ejected during a no-hit bid (3 2/3 IP) for hitting Pablo Sandoval on the back of the shoulder<;>
2015-04-17<;>Let's sit back and think about this for a second. #Orioles fans are upset that Ubaldo Jimenez got ejected. The times, they are a changin'.<;>
2015-04-17<;>Also, the #Orioles had a guy who hadn't given up a hit yet. Now they're in a 4-game set and already into their 'pen G1 in the 4th.<;>
2015-04-17<;>I hope #MLB is paying attention that their home plate umpire at Fenway park made a mockery of their game tonight #Orioles<;>
2015-04-17<;>I heard Remy's explanation, but if that's the case, why weren't the Orioles warned that they shouldn't retaliate?<;>
2015-04-17<;>One of the most ridiculous things I've seen. Jimenez thrown out with no warning. How do u chuck pitcher in 1-0 game in 4th inning? #orioles<;>
2015-04-17<;>Home plate umpire Jordan Baker is being a dick tonight...but he's being a dick to Buck Showalter so Im ok with it. #RedSox #orioles<;>
2015-04-17<;>Don't tell me the Orioles were retaliating for a hard slide, Buck loves when Adam slides like that<;>
2015-04-17<;>Ubaldo has a history of control issues. You toss him without a warning? I know I turned on the game to watch the umpires #Orioles<;>
2015-04-17<;>Ridiculous overreaction by umpire. Ubaldo has a no hitter in 4th not looking to get in beanball war. That's a joke #Orioles<;>
2015-04-17<;>Kevin Gausman will replace Jimenez. #orioles<;>
2015-04-17<;>If this Ubaldo Jimenez showed up for the #Orioles last year I'd have a 2014 World Series Champions cap in my closet<;>
2015-04-17<;>That is one of the most rediculous calls in baseball in years. Doesn't matter it's an #Orioles player, purely rediculous<;>
2015-04-17<;>Immediate theory is #orioles were retaliating for Sandoval's hard slide into Schoop at 2nd base on force play in 2nd inning<;>
2015-04-17<;>Buck going to let home-plate ump Jordan Baker hear it. #Orioles<;>
2015-04-17<;>Jimenez hits Sandoval and is ejected by plate umpire Jordan Baker with 2 outs in 4th. Whaaat???? #orioles<;>

2015-04-17<;>Pedroia grounds into 4-6-3 DP and Jimenez has tossed 3 scoreless innings. 0 hits, 3 walks, 2 strikeouts. 53 pitches #orioles<;>
2015-04-17<;>Buck Showalter has won three manager of the year awards. Apparently that's the consolation prize for never having won a damn thing. #Orioles<;>
2015-04-17<;>43 pitches, 22 strikes, for Jimenez in 2 scoreless innings #orioles<;>
2015-04-17<;>Jimenez issued 1 walk over 7 innings in 1st start vs. Jays. Has walked 2 batters in 2nd inning tonight vs. Red Sox #orioles<;>
2015-04-17<;>Chris Davis doubles off the Green Monster with 1 out in the 2nd. Always a good sign when he's driving the ball the opposite way #orioles<;>

2015-04-08<;>Not sure how that was a 9-pitch at-bat by Lavarnway when he fouled off 57 pitches. Anyway, he walks with 2 outs in 8th. The #orioles 1st one<;>

2015-04-08<;>I'm sure #Orioles will deal Matusz at some point and he'll turn into Arrieta 2.0 elsewhere but here he seems afraid to pound zone<;>
2015-04-08<;>Dave Wallace is a track star when Brian Matusz is on the mound. #Orioles<;>

2015-04-08<;>People who wear redsox jerseys to a Rays Orioles game deserve to be hanged, quartered and brought upon firing squad.<;>
2015-04-08<;>How many people thought Gonzalez would pitch into the 6th inning after throwing 32 pitches in the 1st? #orioles<;>
2015-04-08<;>Gonzalez so far: 5 innings, 3 hits, 0 runs, 3 walks, 4 strikeouts. 77 pitches, 46 strikes. #orioles<;>
2015-04-08<;>That's now five scoreless for Gonzalez and he is at 77 pitches. Great rebound after 32 pitch first inning. #Orioles<;>
2015-04-08<;>So, Manny Machado is up to his old tricks again. #Orioles pic.twitter.com/vRJSv1NW2q<;>
2015-04-08<;>So if I've got this right, #orioles are 2-0 challenging calls and 2-0 when other team challenges.<;>
2015-04-08<;>Of course Machado leading off top of the 5th. #orioles<;>
2015-04-08<;>Holy crap, Machado just made an amazing play at 3rd base to retire Forsythe and end the 4th. Cash may challenge, but...holy crap #orioles<;>
2015-04-08<;>Machado made a lunging backhanded stop, slid into foul territory, got up and fired a strike to Davis at 1st base. #orioles<;>
2015-04-08<;>If you forgot, Manny Machado has one heck of an arm #Orioles @1057TheFan<;>
