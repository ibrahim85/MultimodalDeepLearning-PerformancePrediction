2016-10-01<;>Ok. Orioles lose. Blue Jays and Tigers starting now. An M's win and at worst they need a win tomorrow and a loss by either Tor or Bal.<;>

2016-10-01<;>I love Buck. Hate questioning him but Miley isn't Steve Carlton. I'm screaming to get him out of there when trouble began in 6th. #Orioles<;>
2016-10-01<;>Yankees are pouring it on against the Orioles . Were down 3-1 and they now lead 7-3 in the 8th.<;>

2016-10-01<;>If the Yankees hold this 5-3 lead, then the Wildcard standings would be: Orioles 88-73, Toronto 87-73, Tigers 86-73, SEA 86-74.<;>

2016-10-01<;>Really strange to see Miley still in this game in the seventh. It's not mid-June, is it? Bullpen wasn't taxed last night, either. #Orioles<;>
2016-10-01<;>The Orioles win in spite of Buck. another horrible decision to allow Miley to start the 7th with a fresh pen. Horrible, horrible managing.<;>
2016-10-01<;>When Jim Hunter says an Orioles pitcher has lost it, a pitching change is long overdue.<;>
2016-10-01<;>Wade Miley back out in the 7th. Nolan Reimold enters the game in left field. #Orioles up 3-2. #Birdland<;>
2016-10-01<;>And look what happened. Leadoff HR for Tyler Austin and we're tied #Orioles<;>
2016-10-01<;>Surprised Miley is back out for the 7th #orioles<;>
2016-10-01<;>Miley: 6 innings, 7 hits, 2 runs, 1 walk, 9 strikeouts, WP. 99/67. Time to pass the baton #orioles<;>

2016-09-29<;>#Orioles win another rubber game. Win 2 of 3 in Tor. NewBaldo looks even newer. O's play like NL team. Kim another big hit! C U in Fun City<;>

2016-09-29<;>#BlueJays Gibbons on loss in finale to #Orioles : "Stroman pitched a nice ballgame but we couldn't get anything going"<;>

2016-09-29<;>If TOR goes to BOS playing as lackluster as they've been & @orioles go to NY playing better ball as they've been...O's WILL host a WC game.<;>
2016-09-29<;>Another huge win for the Birds! Vote for tonight's @Carefirst #Orioles Player of the Game. #IBackTheBirds<;>

2016-09-29<;>Once again, soon after being declared dead, the Orioles have rebounded strongly and are on the verge of their fifth win in last six games.<;>

2016-09-29<;>In a race this close little things matter. So far tonight #Orioles are doing the little things better than #BlueJays .<;>
2016-09-29<;>RBI single by Matt Wieters. Trumbo scores. #Orioles lead 4-0 in the 8th. Stroman is done for the night. pic.twitter.com/lWFgbaidL8<;>

2016-09-29<;>Mark Trumbo double, Matt Wieters RBI single and it's 4-0 #Orioles T8. Aaron Loup is in for Marcus Stroman, who's facing a hard-luck L<;>
2016-09-29<;>Jiménez had a huge night! His final line: 6.2 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 3 BB, 5 Ks. (116 pitches) #Clutch pic.twitter.com/uv6QEAFyVT<;>
2016-09-29<;>I can't see too well, was that Ubaldo Jimenez out there throwing a clutch gem? #Orioles pic.twitter.com/rQETfJV3xH<;>
2016-09-29<;>What's worse, getups @MiamiDolphins are wearing tonight, or these monochrome @Orioles uniforms? pic.twitter.com/zNqv95wmUa<;>
2016-09-29<;>Donnie Hart replaces Jiménez with a 3-0 lead in the 7th. #Birdland<;>
2016-09-29<;>Play is overturned and the Orioles get the second out. Jimenez is done for the night. Here comes Hart.<;>
2016-09-29<;>Ubaldo was absolutely dealing tonight when #Orioles needed him most<;>
2016-09-29<;>Who's still with the Blue Jays and me tonight??? #BlueJays 0 #Orioles 3 B7<;>
2016-09-29<;>Can't see Yankees pulling for Jays to make playoffs. Don't expect much of a fight from them when the take on Orioles next three.<;>
2016-09-29<;>It's all coming up Ubaldo. He gets the replay call and gets the hook from Buck after 7 2/3 innings and ONE HIT. #orioles<;>
2016-09-29<;>Bourn walks , steals 2nd , then scores on a single by who? HYUN SOO KIM of course! 3-0 #Orioles in the 7th!<;>
2016-09-29<;>https:// vimeo.com/173065076 #orioles<;>
2016-09-29<;>So the #BlueJays will need to score at least 4 runs off the Orioles bullpen to win tonight.<;>
2016-09-29<;>So, what were the odds that Ubaldo and Kim would be heroes of the final week of the season? #orioles<;>
2016-09-29<;>Attention. An Orioles batter just drew a leadoff walk and then immediately stole second base. Who are these people in O's uniforms tonight?<;>
2016-09-29<;>Hyun-soo Kim: #Orioles hero and legend.<;>
2016-09-29<;>NewBaldo is mowing em down!6 straight early....11 straight into the 6th inn. Has 2-0 lead in Toronto. No HRs... #orioles R on S F & grounder<;>
2016-09-29<;>The waiver wire pickup of Not Awful Ubaldo Jimenez on August 25 was really a slick move by the Orioles .<;>
2016-09-29<;>OMG! JOSE BAUTISTA HIT A BALL IN THE AIR! Fly ball to end the sixth. 2-0 Orioles .<;>
2016-09-29<;>We're up 2-0 through 5! Manny RBI Bourn RBI Jiménez 5 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 2 BB, 3 Ks. pic.twitter.com/WZbLxVZbO9<;>
2016-09-29<;>Ubaldo masterful , but pitch count mounting. His way of shutting teams down #penalert @masnOrioles @Orioles<;>
2016-09-29<;>Obviously you’d prefer the Orioles win, but if the Tigers can’t sweep Atlanta and beat a simulated Indians team, they don’t deserve it.<;>
2016-09-29<;>The best acquisition at the trade deadline was the Orioles acquiring this new Ubaldo Jimenez<;>

2016-09-27<;>The #Astros win, they are now 2.5 games back behind the Orioles . While it's unlikely, they still have a chance with four games remaining.<;>
2016-09-27<;>If #BlueJays win next 2 home games vs. #Orioles Toronto will clinch an AL wild-card spot before heading to Boston for weekend series.<;>

2016-09-23<;>This one is going to extras. @Zbritton will pitch the 10th. #LetsGoOs #Birdland<;>
2016-09-23<;>Terribly managed inning by Buck. How do you PH for 1 of your best hitters and not PR for 1 of your slowest runners? #orioles<;>
2016-09-23<;>Thanks to everyone who came out and supported the Orioles tonight<;>
2016-09-23<;>So yes, the #orioles do have a beef with Welington<;>
2016-09-23<;>Machado walks. 2 on, 2 outs for Davis, who's trying to prevent free baseball #orioles<;>
2016-09-23<;>HE WAS BLOCKING THE WHOLE PLATE! GTFOH @ORIOLES<;>
2016-09-23<;>Hardy still ruled out. If that's not blocking the plate, not sure what qualifies #orioles<;>
2016-09-23<;>#Orioles potential winning run called out at the plate... IT'S UNDER REVIEW...<;>
2016-09-23<;>The ruling on the field stands. Hardy is out. Jones remains on second with Machado up and two outs. #Birdland<;>
2016-09-23<;>Matt Wieters ties the game for the @Orioles in the 9th! It's his 1st career game-tying HR in 9th inning or later.<;>
2016-09-23<;>With Hardy on 2nd, Jones singles. Hardy is called out at the plate, but the play is under review. #Birdland<;>
2016-09-23<;>Should Buck have pinch-run for Hardy? Should Dickerson have sent Hardy? Did catcher block the plate? #orioles<;>

2016-09-21<;>Orioles lose to Red Sox, 5-1, so Mariners are now just two out of second Wild Card spot with 10 games remaining.<;>

2016-09-21<;>With two outs in the top of the 9th, Buck replaces Duensing with Mike Wright. Score remains 5-1 Boston. #Birdland<;>
2016-09-21<;>If this holds, it will be 60 innings since the Orioles last scored more than two runs in an inning. (1st inning on Thursday.)<;>
2016-09-21<;>I still think there's a legitimate chance the Orioles make the postseason. But every loss stings a bit more each time.<;>

2016-09-21<;>I can't believe the Orioles were trying to get my hopes up all this time, lmaoo.<;>
2016-09-21<;>I wonder if there is an advanced metric for what the Orioles just did to themselves.<;>
2016-09-21<;>Unless/until @Orioles score more runs v Buchholz (5.20 ERA) the error & Benitendi HR are secondary. O's aren't scoring. Can't win w/o runs.<;>

2016-08-20<;>#Orioles logic: Chris Davis strikes out multiple times per game, they lead the east. Chris Davis heats up, they fall to third place.<;>
2016-08-20<;>Chris Davis has now homered in 4 consecutive games. The last Oriole to do so was Davis June 7-12th (5 games).<;>

2016-08-19<;>1 inning at a time...It's going to be an interesting night. Astros plate 5 runs in 2nd, Miley exits, Ubaldo Jiménez takes over with 2 outs.<;>
2016-08-19<;>That didn't last long: #Astros now up 6-5 in 2nd IP over #Orioles after Altuve 2-run double<;>
2016-08-19<;>The final score of this game is gonna be Astros-106, Orioles - 97. Calling it now<;>
2016-08-19<;>Despite giving up four homers in the 1st, the Astros lead the Orioles 6-5 in the second. Amazing.<;>
2016-08-19<;>The Orioles hit four home runs in the first inning. They will come to bat in the second inning with a deficit.<;>
2016-08-19<;>More boos as Miley departs. Never easy being the new kid. Here comes Ubaldo. Hasn't been easy being him, either. #orioles<;>

2016-07-26<;>Sources: The #Padres were close to dealing Upton Jr. to #Orioles before Angelos changed mind & changed deal ($). Shifted to #BlueJays then.<;>
2016-07-26<;>Did I miss when Steve Pearce became a starting pitcher? Because that's the only reason the Orioles should have any interest in him<;>
2016-07-26<;>. @Orioles have won 20 of their last 24 home games. Baltimore’s 37-14 home record is the best in @MLB . pic.twitter.com/pRKEpvvkCG<;>

2016-07-26<;>FYI: WHEN the O's win tonight, and if the Cubs lose, the Orioles will be tied for the best record in the MLB #orioles<;>
2016-07-26<;>In all honesty, I would have given up Hansel Rodriguez just to force the Orioles to keep Ubaldo Jimenez on their roster. This is a big win.<;>
2016-07-26<;>Bruce will be traded by the end of the deadline .. I predict to the Dodgers or Orioles<;>
2016-07-26<;>It's official. Melvin Upton Jr. has been traded to Blue Jays not Orioles . Here's why that's not a big loss for O's: http:// bit.ly/2a45eFm<;>
2016-07-26<;>In case you missed it, this was the final play of the game last night. #Birdland pic.twitter.com/dsxR32kjB5<;>
2016-07-26<;>Sources: #Orioles offered Jimenez and two minor leaguers to #Padres for Upton. Deal believed to have broken down over finances.<;>
2016-07-26<;>That is NOT to infer #Orioles are “cheap.” Opening day payroll of $147.6M was largest in club history by nearly $30M. Had to make Upton fit.<;>
2016-07-26<;>Per Elias, Before last night, #orioles didn't have walk-off win on E-1 since the final game of 2009 season against the Jays (Brandon League)<;>

2016-07-26<;>Upton trade for the @BlueJays might of been so the @Orioles didn't get him. #BlueJays<;>
2016-07-26<;>Upton would have helped the Orioles a little, but whatever. The biggest part of this is the O's yet again can't find a taker for Ubaldo.<;>

2016-07-20<;>11-pitch at-bat for Rickard, and he grounds out. But in Buck's absence I'll say you can still win an at-bat even when making an out #orioles<;>

2016-07-08<;>Among MLB pitchers with at least 80 innings, Ubaldo's 7.38 ERA is the worst - by almost a run and a half (Buchholz 5.91) #Orioles<;>
2016-07-08<;>Ubaldo is a nice guy. He should also not be anywhere near a mound for the @Orioles ....<;>
2016-07-08<;>Today is 7th time this season that Ubaldo allowed more runs than innings pitched. No other starter has done it more than 5 times. #Orioles<;>
2016-07-08<;>Jimenez: 1 1/3 innings, 5 hits, 5 runs, 2 walks, 0 strikeouts, WP. 45/25. ERA is 7.38 #orioles<;>
2016-07-08<;>Ubaldo gave up more runs in 1 2/3 innings than the Orioles entire pitching staff in the 1966 World Series<;>
2016-07-08<;>the orioles will finally sucker up and dfa ubaldo's trash ass after the game<;>
2016-07-08<;>Ubaldo JImenez (highest paid @Orioles FA pitcher in their history) booed as he exits in 2nd inn down 4-1. His last start? This can't go on.<;>
2016-07-08<;>Two runners on, one out in the 2nd and Buck makes a change. Mike Wright replaces Jiménez as we trail 4-1. #Birdland<;>
2016-07-08<;>Pre game today @Orioles players said they believe they have the pitchers they need to win (have to say that). Jimenez clearly not 1 of them.<;>

2016-07-08<;>Ouch! Machado robbed of a would-be home run in left field. #Orioles trail 2-1. #Birdland<;>
2016-07-08<;>Here's something I never thought I would be saying in the second inning of an Orioles game... "Ugh, hurry up and get Mike Wright loose."<;>

2016-06-09<;>Martin, who was riding a 3-for-19, lines a single up the middle to score Saunders. 1on, 2out, 3-1 #Bluejays bot1. #Jays #Orioles<;>
2016-06-09<;>Saunders doubles to RF. Donaldson thought about tagging up, then remembered Trumbo was out there. 2-1 #Bluejays bot1. #Jays #Orioles<;>
2016-06-09<;>With two outs, @Mtrumbo44 doubles to right and Machado is called out at home, #Orioles challenge, but the call was upheld. O's lead 1-0<;>
2016-06-09<;>Premature hornulation from #Bluejays scoreboard crew as Bautista leads off bot1 with a hard-hit 2B off LCF wall. #Jays down 1-0. #Orioles<;>
2016-06-09<;>Yo draft my boy @jake_blewitt u know damn well u not using that 48th round pick @Phillies @Orioles @Yankees @RedSox @Nationals @Braves @Cubs<;>
2016-06-09<;>With one out, Machado slides in for a double scoring @SimplyAJ10 from 2nd. #Orioles up 1-0 in the 1st. #VoteOrange<;>
2016-06-09<;>Two outs in the inning there, so don't know why Machado wasn't running on contact. Would have made it home easily on Trumbo's hit. #Orioles<;>
2016-06-09<;>One angle sure looks like Martin missed Machado with the first swipe tag. #Bluejays #Jays #Orioles<;>

2016-05-25<;>I'm tired @Orioles<;>
2016-05-25<;>Scott Feldman, natural-born reliever. #Astros #Orioles<;>
2016-05-25<;>With all due respect to Scott Feldman, he's not really a strikeout pitcher. The Orioles are a strikeout team.<;>
2016-05-24<;>it up for Givens! To inning No. we go! #Birdland<;>
2016-05-24<;>With that one-out double, Joey Rickard now has more hits vs relievers (22) than starters (21). 114 PAs vs SPs, 66 vs RPs. #Orioles<;>
2016-05-24<;>Ryan Flaherty has the same amount on RBI's for the #Orioles that I do this season...he does have 53 more at bats though.<;>
2016-05-24<;>Gattis strikes out to end the 11th. To the 12th! Feldman will face 9-1-2 of the Orioles lineup. #Astros<;>

2016-05-24<;>Well, at least the Orioles can hit balls really hard right at infielders, too.<;>
2016-05-24<;>And he gets out of the jam! Trum will lead off the 11th. #Birdland<;>
2016-05-24<;>Givens gets the call in the 10th with 2 runners on and 2 outs.<;>
2016-05-24<;>Springer singles to center! Altuve up with runners on first and second -- and the Orioles will go to the bullpen here.<;>

2016-05-23<;>Tolliver would give the #Orioles two things they need: Another left-hander and a guy that can be optioned freely.<;>
2016-05-23<;>Bam. Big TY to @gypsyoak for the Reggie card. Then they also tossed in a Ripken Jr that is beautiful!!! #Orioles pic.twitter.com/ku7lWDaheo<;>

2016-04-22<;>I was a TV intern for the Orioles in 2012...when Arrieta was 3-9 with a 6.20 ERA. Watching his reinvention with the #Cubs is truly amazing.<;>

2016-04-16<;>Orioles snatch defeat from the jaws of victory tonight. No business sending Gallardo out for 7th. Team implodes afterward.<;>
2016-04-16<;>PS: As I say every year, the #Orioles can't win a World Series with TJ on the roster. Period.<;>
2016-04-16<;>Really a deflating situation here. The Orioles had enough bullpen to avoid this and probably won't need any relievers to pitch til Tuesday.<;>

2016-04-15<;>DOUBLE TROUBLE: @Mtrumbo44 is the first Oriole with two homers in one inning! #Orioles win 11-5! #IBackTheBirds pic.twitter.com/0gR8VRIYqc<;>
2016-04-15<;>ORIOLES WIN<;>
2016-04-15<;>#orioles win 11-5. Hit 5 HRs in 2 innings. Plan to hit at least 2 more during the postgame meal. Worley the win. 'Pen 3 scoreless. O's 8-2.<;>
2016-04-15<;>An apparent INF hit becomes an out at 3rd base thanks to Machado's heads-up play and Hardy being Hardy #orioles<;>
2016-04-15<;>And J.J. Hardy once again is in the right place at the right time. Takes Machado throw and gets out at 3rd. Umps reverse call. #orioles<;>
2016-04-15<;>Lots of power to choose from! VOTE for Friday's @CareFirst #Orioles Player of the Game! #IBackTheBirds<;>
2016-04-15<;>According to Stats LLC, Mark Trumbo is the first player in Orioles history to hit two home runs in the same inning. #Birdland @Mtrumbo44<;>
2016-04-15<;>Have an inning, Mr. Trumbo! #Birdland HR 1: http:// atmlb.com/1r10Qi5 HR 2: http:// atmlb.com/1r10Tum pic.twitter.com/TruQZW5ptG<;>
2016-04-15<;>To answer everyone asking, yes, Mark Trumbo is first #orioles player with 2 HRs in same inning. Per STATS<;>
2016-04-15<;>Jonathan Schoop homers for the second time tonight! #Orioles lead Rangers 11-5. #Birdland<;>
2016-04-15<;>Is there anyway the Orioles can sign Machado and Schoop to a combined contract? Like 10-years, $350MM combined for both of them lol<;>
2016-04-15<;>No. 42 looks great tonight on Mtrumbo44. He's having quite a start with #Orioles . Bombs bursting. Couldn't happen to a better guy.<;>
2016-04-15<;>Extend Machado & Schoop through 2049 @Orioles do it right now<;>
2016-04-15<;>Jonathan Schoop - Baltimore Orioles (3) - 2 today Solo<;>
2016-04-15<;>#Orioles hit more home runs in the 7th inning tonight than the #Braves have hit in 2016.<;>
2016-04-15<;>Schoop homers again leading off the 8th. Why not? #orioles<;>
2016-04-15<;>Man, @MrJoshCharles , your @Orioles are mashing.<;>
2016-04-15<;>Every time the Orioles start scoring a lot of runs against the Rangers, I hope they just keep going until they get to 31.<;>
2016-04-15<;>Last time #orioles scored 9 or more runs in same inning was Sept 11, 2015 vs KC.<;>
2016-04-15<;>Mark Trumbo hit 2 Home Runs and 5 RBI's in the same inning. Orioles plated 9 in the 7th Inning. 4 Home Runs this offense is unreal.<;>
2016-04-15<;>Non-Fiction: The #Mariners traded Mark Trumbo to the #Orioles for Steve Clevenger.<;>
2016-04-15<;>Despite all warnings to the contrary, the Orioles just messed with Texas.<;>
2016-04-15<;>You have to be mentally strong and insane to be an Orioles fan, tonight is a great example.<;>

2016-04-15<;>Mark Trumbo - Baltimore Orioles (5) - 2 today 3-run<;>
2016-04-15<;>The Orioles are really good at hitting home runs.<;>
2016-04-15<;>Buck said earlier that Trumbo isn't just "some brute" who goes up there looking to hit HRs. True. But he does hit HRs #orioles #analysis<;>
2016-04-15<;>LET'S GOOOOOO!!! GOODBYE HOMERUN!!!! TRUMBO WITH HIS 2ND OF THE INNING!!! AHHHHHHHHHHH O'S UP 10-5 NOW!!! LET'S GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #orioles<;>
2016-04-15<;>You can't stop Trumbo. You can't even contain him or @Orioles now. 9 run 7th.<;>
2016-04-15<;>Trumbo homers again! 3-run shot. His 2nd HR this inning. #orioles lead 10-5. This one landed in O's bullpen<;>
2016-04-15<;>Mark Trumbo homers for the second time this inning. For real. Fifth of the year. Guy is in a zone. #orioles<;>
2016-04-15<;>#Orioles lineup better than my lofty expectations. Pop was a lock but they grind ABs. They may just score enough to counter subpar pitching.<;>

2016-04-15<;>Machado scores on Adam Jones' 2nd RBI single of the night. Fans here are booing. Hard to argue with them. #orioles up 7-5<;>
2016-04-15<;>@Orioles 2016: probably won't pitch great but will hit a whole lot of HRs. Not an ideal formula but it works sometimes #BuckleUp<;>

2016-04-14<;>RBI single for Ian Desmond!!! #Rangers and #Orioles tied 3-3 in the 6th! #NeverEverQuit<;>
2016-04-14<;>J.J. Hardy rips an RBI single in the 6th to give the #Orioles a 3-1 lead, knocking Cole Hamels out of the game. #Birdland<;>

2016-04-11<;>Orioles have been AL's winningest team (360-293) in 5 seasons GM Dan Duquette and Manager Buck Showalter have been together. @Orioles<;>
2016-04-11<;>. @SimplyAJ10 says could have played today. Hopes tomorrow. No reason to take any chances #orioles<;>
2016-04-11<;>Giants and Orioles fans are automatically more loyal than other fans because they willingly wear orange clothes<;>
2016-04-11<;>Only other time @Orioles were 5-0 was 1970 when they finished 108-54 and won World Series. Including postseason, they were 115-55 that year<;>
