(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)MoreMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones left Tuesday's game against the Minnesota Twins with what was called an illness and was later transported to a hospital for further tests.Manager Buck Showalter said they weren't certain what was bothering Jones after he left the game in the second inning. Jones started in center field as usual and struck out in his first at-bat before being replaced by Matt Angle, who pinch-hit for Jones in the second inning."After talking with a few people, he was feeling a little down and just weak," Showalter said. "Then after his first at-bat and everything, it didn't get any better. Didn't like what he was describing, so we decided to get him out of there and let the doctors take a look at him."They're still looking into it, haven't really been able to nail down. We just want to rule a lot of things out to be on the safe side. We're going to let them do some more tests at the hospital."Showalter declined to say what was bothering Jones and wasn't sure how long he would be at the hospital.Jones has played in 124 of Baltimore's 126 games this season, batting .297 with 22 home runs and 77 RBIs. Angle was recalled earlier in the day from Triple-A Norfolk when the Orioles designated slumping outfielder Felix Pie for assignment.
