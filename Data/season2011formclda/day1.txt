Now he's getting paid to live in a decked-out fan cave, watch every MLB game in 2011 and share his take with the blogosphere.It's kind of like my job, except he has 14 more TVs to watch games on and he has to live with a Yankees fan.Wagner, who appeared on "Sports with Coleman" on FOX 1370 this week, was one of 10,000 applicants in the contest. “I got lucky enough to get picked," he said from his fan cave in Manhattan. var adSkipCounter = 0; “The set up is fantastic, Wagner said. "They’ve got everything in here. There’s pool tables, air hockey tables. The setup where we’re going to watch the games, it’s 15 Sony televisions -- three 60-inch screens and 12 32-inch screens -- and they’ve got a whole living room set up for us to sit and watch the games."The only downside is that he has to live under the same roof with a Yankees fan from now until season's end.“We get along really well, aside for the fact that he’s a Yankees fan," Wagner said of roommate Mike O'Hara.Wagner said that though he is blogging and Tweeting about all 30 MLB teams, he will still root for the Orioles.“We're allowed to show where our passions are," Wagner told Coleman. "We’re allowed to be fans while we're in this cave. And so yeah, I’m obviously going to be partial to the Orioles. I’m going to root for 'em while I’m on the camera and while I’m watching these games."     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: 'thumbnails-f',     container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives',     placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives',     target_type: 'mix'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed'Blushing' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn't to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

2  BALTIMORE (WJZ)—It looks like the weather may cooperate for opening day at Camden Yards—just three days away. That means the field needs to be in perfect condition. Jessica Kartalija is following the final preparations. The countdown is on at Camden Yards. For head groundskeeper Nicole Sherry that means that the baseball diamond has to be in absolute perfect condition—not just for the home opener, but of course for the rest of the season. “We’re going to get the paint ready to paint our Opening Day logo, remove all the buckets from the warning track and get the tarps ready to be put out,” Sherry said. Sherry is used to talking turfs.  “Monday is coming quick,” Sherry said. “And we’ll be here tomorrow and Sunday, as well, to get everything prepped  and kind of finishing touches on everything.” This is an exact science. “A lot of people don’t think it’s anything more than just cutting grass, breaking dirt,” Sherry said. “But everything in nature is related to it. I have to watch out for disease pressure. I have to watch out for wind, rain can dry it out or oversaturate the field.” Sherry says one thing you won’t see this season is the English ivy that usually covers the batters eye wall. Sherry says it was removed because of root rot. Sherry’s season starts way before the home opener. “You know, it has its stresses like with any job,” she said. “But I can’t complain. This is my office. What more do you want, you know?” Sherry tells us that she is constantly checking the satellite radar just like our own meteorologists. Of course, a warm, sunny and beautiful day can make all of the difference in the world. It improves the vibrancy of the baseball diamond. The Orioles season starts Friday night. The home opener is Monday. You can see the Orioles take on the Detroit Tigers live on WJZ-TV. Our special pregame coverage begins at 2 p.m. Then stick around for the Orioles game. It’s a full day of Orioles baseball live right here on WJZ-TV on Monday.  var addthis_product = 'wpp-261'; var addthis_config = {"data_track_clickback":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == "undefined"){ addthis_share = {"url_transforms":{"shorten":{"twitter":"bitly"}},"shorteners":{"bitly":{"login":"cbslocal","apiKey":"R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca"}}};}
