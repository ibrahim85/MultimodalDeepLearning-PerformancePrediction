He continued on toward home plate, where several Orioles players stepped away from their pregame batting practice to shake his hand.Jeter is his era’s DiMaggio. Admired. Diffident. By all outward appearances, charmed. He became the Yankees’ full-time shortstop in 1996, at age 21, and only once since then has his team failed to qualify for the playoffs. (His 599 postseason at-bats amount to just about an extra season’s worth of swings.) The Yankees have reached the World Series seven times during Jeter’s tenure and prevailed in five of them. Jeter is just 6 hits from becoming the 28th player in baseball history to reach 3,000 hits (a quest that was delayed when he was placed on the disabled list with a calf strain on June 14). His baseball earnings have surpassed $200 million — not counting the three-year, $51-million contract that he signed before this season. The tabloids track his romances with one glamorous woman after another — the latest being the actress Minka Kelly, Esquire’s “Sexiest Woman Alive” in 2010. He is building a house in Tampa, Fla., a waterfront paradise so massive, at 30,875 square feet, that locals have dubbed it St. Jetersburg.Just one thing has reduced Jeter to human scale, and it is not surprising what it is: age. On June 26 he turns 37, which makes Jeter a decade older than Einstein was when he published the special theory of relativity, a decade older than Lindbergh when he set the Spirit of St. Louis down in Paris and 15 years older than Ted Williams when he batted .406 in 1941. Even more to the point, Jeter is a dozen years past the best baseball version of himself — the 25-year-old who in 1999 played a sprightly shortstop and also functioned as a slugger, hitting 24 home runs, to go with 102 runs batted in and a batting average of .349. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The night I watched him in Baltimore was like most games for Jeter these days, only more so, because it went on for 15 innings. He came to bat seven times, and in six of those he hit ground balls — two of which squirted through the infield for base hits. He struck out in his other plate appearance. He leads all of baseball, by a wide margin, in his ratio of ground balls to balls lifted in the air, an arcane but telling statistic. Jeter can no longer consistently bring the bat through the hitting zone at the proper moment, and with enough authority, to hit line drives into the outfield gaps or fly balls that clear the fences. (Think of that classic advice to Little League hitters: Swing the bat as if you’re mad at the ball! Jeter swings as if he’s mad at the ground, with an abbreviated, downward stroke that pounds ball after ball into the turf.) In his best season, he had 70 extra-base hits. He is on pace for just 30 extra-base hits this season, meaning that about once a week he gets something more than a single.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  We’re fascinated by sports partly because in physical matters, elite athletes set the outer limits. They do what we wish we could: hit a baseball 400 feet, dunk a basketball, sprint 100 meters in less than 10 seconds. Their feats look so pleasurable in the doing that some of us, long past our best playing days, dream at night we are in their realm — say, for example, patrolling the expanse of a big-league center field, or digging our cleats into the batter’s box as a pitcher goes into his windup. (Or firing a slapshot at a goalie, as one of my dreams went not too long ago, even though I have never played ice hockey in my life and don’t even follow the sport.)But the careers of elite athletes, enviable as they may be, are foreshortened versions of a human lifespan. Physical decline — in specific ways that affect what they do and who they are — begins for them before it does for normal people. The athletes themselves rarely see the beginnings of this process, or if they do, either do not acknowledge it or try to fight it off like just another inside fastball. They alter their training routines. Eat more chicken and fish, less red meat. They try to get “smarter” at their sport.A great many of us, their fans, live in our own version of denial — even in this age of super-slow-motion replay and ever more granular statistical data. We want to think our favorite players have good years left, great accomplishments ahead of them, just as we would hope the same for ourselves. The writer Susan Jacoby, who happens to be a devoted baseball fan, is the author of “Never Say Die: The Myth and Marketing of the New Old Age.” “Fans don’t like to watch aging in these relatively young guys,” she told me. “It makes us uncomfortable. We think, If it happens to them, what the hell is going to happen to us?” Jacoby, a self-described insomniac who listens to sports-talk radio in the middle of the night, said she has been appalled at the “venom” she sometimes hears directed at Jeter. “It’s like they’re saying, ‘The hero is not performing.’ Well, he’s gotten older.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Older, for ballplayers, begins much sooner than we think. “A lot of fans, if they really studied it, would be surprised at how early players really peak, especially hitters,” Jed Hoyer said when he spoke to me by phone from San Diego, where he is general manager of the Padres. Previously he was an executive with the Red Sox, one of the more data-driven franchises in baseball. “The years of 26 to 30 are usually the prime years,” Hoyer continued, “but you’ll see plenty of guys start to trend down, even if it’s subtle, before they’re 30.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The concept of “old” is mutable in many of the sports we follow. The swimmer Michael Phelps, perhaps the greatest U.S. Olympian ever, climbed out of the water after a race a couple of months ago and said to reporters, “I feel like an old man coming out of the pool sometimes.” Phelps, who turns 26 at the end of the month, is indeed past his prime, but mainly because of the course he and his coach set. Phelps trained six consecutive years over one period without taking a single day off, a regimen that produced 16 medals at the last two summer Olympics, including eight golds in 2008 in Beijing. He is stronger than he has ever been and just about as lean — 197 pounds as opposed to the 193 he weighed at his first Olympics, when he was 15. If all it took was physical attributes, Phelps could probably match his accomplishments from Beijing. But he can no longer summon the focus and motivation to train like he did. Phelps plans to swim in London in 2012, but in fewer events. “There’s a volitional and psychological window,” Phelps’s coach, Bob Bowman, told me. “It closes. A lot of it has to do with the effort you put in up to that point.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  A version of the same syndrome — in the vernacular, “burnout” — may be afflicting Tiger Woods, who looks like a very old 35-year-old in a sport in which 35 isn’t that old. Yes, Woods has suffered numerous injuries as well as an incalculable impact on his performance from chaos in his personal life. But it is also true that he has been hyperfocused on golf for an unusually long time — in essence, a professional since he was 2, when he carried a tiny golf bag onto the set of “The Mike Douglas Show” and, with Bob Hope looking over his shoulder, demonstrated his swing. Lots of things are no doubt troubling Woods, but 33 years of high-intensity golf in 35 years of life is quite likely part of the problem.Pro basketball, with its focus on the extreme athleticism of its players, is marketed as a young man’s game, but at the championship level, it is just as often a sport for old men. Nearly every year, one of the older teams in the league — versions of the stereotypical old heads at the “Y” — advances to and often wins the N.B.A. finals. Earlier this month, the Dallas Mavericks — led by the 33-year-old Dirk Nowitzki, the 38-year-old Jason Kidd, in his 17th season in the league, and several other key players well into their 30s — prevailed in the finals over the 26-year-old LeBron James and the much younger Miami Heat. In basketball, a player who loses his man on defense can get help from a teammate. Crafty older players find ways to compensate for their loss of quickness. Cleverness matters. (Fake shot, induce overeager youngster off his feet to attempt block, lean forward as he lands on you — advance to foul line for two free throws.)Baseball offers no such workarounds. It is said to be the hardest game to understand, the most nuanced. And yet, for all the rich literature paying it homage, from Roth, Updike and Malamud to countless lesser literary figures, it is, at its core, about one thing only: pitcher versus hitter, an unforgiving competitive dynamic.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “How can you think and hit at the same time?” Yogi Berra once said, which like many of the quotes attributed to the former Yankees catcher, even the malapropisms, contains an essential truth. You can’t think and hit because there’s not time for both.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In 1987, A. Bartlett Giamatti, then president of the National League and soon to become baseball’s commissioner, was curious to know more about the science of the pitcher-hitter duel. He asked an old friend, the Yale professor Robert Adair, to do some research and gave him the title, no doubt with a wink, Physicist to the National League. Adair ended up producing a book, “The Physics of Baseball,” that is surprisingly accessible and even funny at times. If any aspiring young player were to read it, he might give up the idea of trying to make a living hitting a baseball, because it seems nearly impossible.At 90 miles per hour, average major-league speed, a baseball leaves the pitcher’s hand and travels about 56 feet to home plate in 0.4 seconds, or 400 milliseconds. The batter’s eyes must first find the ball, Adair writes, then sensory cells in the retina encode information on its speed and trajectory and send it to the brain. This all takes about 75 milliseconds, during which the pitched ball has traveled nine feet.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The brain then sends messages through the spinal cord that tell muscles to initiate the swing. Adair writes that the first such messages go to the batter’s legs to prompt him to step into the ball. (Jeter, at the beginning of this season, tried to hit without a stride. Instead of making his own actions quicker, he basically tried to buy himself some milliseconds by retraining his brain to skip the first part of the swing process. He wasn’t comfortable with it and is taking a stride again, though it’s a short one.)The batter continues to track the ball as muscles in his arms and upper body begin to bring the bat around, but once the pitch is halfway to the plate, it is too late for him to change the swing plane. He must instantaneously form a mental picture of the ball’s course, then direct his swing to where he believes it will be. This is why batters are fooled by sliders and other pitches with so-called late break. If it weren’t “psychologically upsetting,” Adair writes, a hitter could just as well close his eyes once the ball is halfway to the plate and get the same result.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The pitcher-hitter confrontation is weighted against any hitter, but particularly older ones, because the batter’s success depends almost entirely on attributes that decline with age — eyesight, visual processing and fast-twitch muscle. Most big-league hitters tend to have good eyesight (they’re young), but even if they retain it into their 30s, it has probably already degraded in subtle ways. “There’s 20-20, and there’s amazing 20-20,” Don Teig, a Connecticut optometrist who works with professional athletes, told me. “You may still be able to read the line on the eye chart, but after your early 20s, you probably won’t see it with the same clarity and detail.”According to Teig, the “visual-motor system,” as he called it — nerves and muscles that control the focusing of the lens, as well as the lens itself — becomes less supple with age. At the same time, an athlete Jeter’s age is going through changes in muscle composition that make him less explosive. Human muscle is made up of fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers, which people have in different proportions. No matter what your starting mix is, you lose fast-twitch fibers before you notice a decline in overall muscle mass.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The whole state of affairs — diminished eyesight, slower visual processing, slower-firing muscles — amounts to a sort of triple whammy for someone trying to hit in the big leagues. The changes might be infinitesimal, but the margin for error is nil.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  A baseball player devoted to training can maintain his overall strength, fitness, flexibility and balance, just as millions of adults do well into middle age if they devote themselves to working out. But it is impossible — at least within the rules as they relate to performance-enhancing drugs — for a ballplayer to be as fast-firing at 37 as he was in his mid-20s. As H. Lee Sweeney, chairman of physiology at the University of Pennsylvania’s medical school, explained it to me: “Your speed and power are the first things that go. You can do the same exercises every day. You can increase your workouts. But there’s not a lot you can do about it.” Photo        Credit             Photo illustration by Tom Schierlitz for The New York Times. Set Design by Kevin O'Callaghan, James Korpai and Chris Malec.           The Yankees’ starting pitcher in that 15-inning game in Baltimore was Bartolo Colon, who is the unlikeliest-looking big-league hurler I’ve ever seen. At 5-foot-11 and 265 pounds, with meaty forearms and a huge midsection, he has the build and bearing of a boxer who let himself go after leaving the ring and put on about 80 pounds.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Colon has also had an unlikely career arc. After a decade as an elite pitcher, ending in 2005, when he was 32, he pitched sparingly over the next four seasons because of injuries — and not at all last year. An article in The New York Times in May revealed that Colon underwent a novel operation before this season in his native Dominican Republic: his own fat and bone-marrow stem cells were injected into his right elbow, to treat an injured ligament, and shoulder, for a damaged rotator cuff. The Florida doctor who performed the surgery said he has used human-growth hormone in similar treatments in other patients, but not with Colon; had he done so, that could be construed as a violation of baseball’s drug policies. Baseball is investigating.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The entire issue is ethically murky, as is usually the case in matters of sports and performance enhancement. Colon’s surgery certainly sounds strange, but no more so than the surgery Tommy John had to repair the ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow must have seemed in 1974 — a procedure now so routine that it’s performed on high-school pitchers and even Little Leaguers. In “Tommy John surgery,” as it is now commonly called, a new ligament, usually from a pitcher’s own tissue, is used as a graft inside his elbow. But sometimes cadaver tissue is used — which, in theory, could be considered a performance-enhancing element from outside the body, just as synthetic human-growth hormone is.Colon, who is 38, has been amazing this season. He pitches deep into games. His fastball has been clocked at 97 miles per hour. But to watch him out there on the mound, a fat man with a bionic arm, is a little surreal. (Colon went on the disabled list earlier this month, but the injury was not to his arm; he strained the hamstring muscle in his left leg while running to cover first base.) Whatever the circumstances of his operation, he calls to mind baseball’s steroid era — roughly, the 1990s through about 2004 — when the game’s historic norms as they relate to age and performance were subverted and players in their mid-30s and older surged rather than declined.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Steroids are synthetic versions of testosterone. They worked beautifully for baseball players because they replenished muscle — including fast-twitch fibers — that would otherwise have been diminishing as levels of natural testosterone declined with age. Barry Bonds hit 258 home runs in his five seasons between the ages of 35 and 39 — an average of 51 a year. The pitcher Roger Clemens led the National League in earned-run average at age 42. Rafael Palmeiro’s best home-run seasons began when he was 30 and continued until he was 38. Many others experienced similar improvement. Baseball had never seen anything like it. (Bonds and Palmeiro have acknowledged their steroid use, though Bonds said he doped unknowingly. Clemens is awaiting trial on charges related to lying about steroid use; he has pleaded not guilty and denies doping.)The mythology is that old-time players, who did not lift weights and knew nothing about nutrition, had mercilessly short careers. And that today’s players, who condition themselves year-round — often with the help of private trainers, the most up-to-date scientific methods, nutritionists and massage therapists — play longer and have more years of peak performance. It makes sense. It’s also not true.With more rigorous drug testing, a typical baseball career is beginning to look again as it did throughout the game’s history. Journeymen players stay in the game until their early- or mid-30s, and all-star-level players maybe a couple of years beyond that. A handful of superstars retain enough skills to make significant contributions into their late 30s. Those with the most talent almost certainly lose their skills at the same rate as lesser players, but they stay in the game for a long time because 85 percent of a superstar is still a very good player.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The rotund, hard-living Babe Ruth was a productive player until age 39. Older baseball fans remember Willie Mays’s sad last years with Mets, when he was past 40 and couldn’t play anymore, and may assume that he hung on far too long. But at age 40, while still playing for the San Francisco Giants, Mays led the league in on-base percentage and stole 23 bases.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Even the game’s greatest players, though, cannot defy biology. However long they play, their best seasons occur when they are still strapping young men in all their fast-twitch glory. Stan Musial, who played till age 42, had his best home-run year at 27. Joe DiMaggio retired at 36 but his strongest season — 46 home runs, 167 runs batted in, .673 slugging percentage — came when he was just 22. Ken Griffey Jr. played through the heart of the steroid era but is one of the few sluggers from that age untouched by scandal. His four best power years were from age 26 to 29.When hitters begin to show signs of age — swings and misses, foul balls and weak ground balls on pitches they used to crush — they start to “cheat,” as it is said within the game. The term doesn’t mean what it sounds like and has nothing to do with taking drugs or using corked bats. What’s meant by it is that players make adjustments. A hitter will look for a certain kind of pitch, or “eliminate” parts of the strike zone and decide to swing only at, say, a pitch on the inner half, below the belt. He makes an educated guess about what a pitcher will throw based on years of experience in the game. It amounts to making a swing plan in advance, and it’s more common among older hitters who cannot respond as quickly to what they see.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  One night in Miami, at the home ballpark of the Florida Marlins, I sat behind home plate with a scout for a big-league team, whose job it is to observe and report on the tendencies and weaknesses of future opponents. He had recently seen a game involving the Phillies, whose 39-year-old left fielder, Raul Ibanez, was slumping. The scout figured Ibanez would revive, at least somewhat. “He’s one of the biggest cheaters out there,” he said, meaning it as a compliment.On the field that night before the game, I talked with Andre Dawson, a Hall of Famer who played mostly with the Chicago Cubs and the Montreal Expos and is now a Marlins executive. Dawson was in uniform — he had been participating in some pregame drills — and at 56 still looked trim and strong. I asked him when he felt at his absolute physical peak. “Wow,” he said. “A long time ago. I would say probably at about 27.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Dawson had his best year relatively late, at 32. By his mid-30s, he could sense that he had lost something. “The funny thing is that I was a stronger man in all ways,” he said. “But my bat was not as quick. I could tell. You start missing pitches, fouling off pitches you used to square up. You’re a hair late. It’s not a good feeling. That’s when you start playing the mind game with the pitcher and catcher.” I asked if that meant that he was just guessing at what the pitcher would throw. Dawson chuckled. “We hitters don’t like to call it that,” he said. “We say you’re ‘sitting on a pitch.’ And if you get that pitch, you’d better hit it.” [{"headline":"The New York Times Magazine","summary":"The best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week, including exclusive feature stories, photography, columns and more.","product-code":"MA","product-title":"The New York Times Magazine","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/magazine?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=MA&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Morning Briefing","summary":"Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.","product-code":"NN","product-title":"Morning Briefing","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/morning-briefing?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=NN&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"NYT Living","summary":"Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.","product-code":"LI","product-title":"NYT Living","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/pages\/nytliving\/nytliving-email\/index.html?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=LI&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"}]      Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

To admit weakness is akin to peeling off a protective layer. It feels like inviting failure, and it may be.Pat Burrell, a 34-year-old outfielder for the World Series champion San Francisco Giants, had his breakout year as a member of the Phillies in 2002, at 25. He had another big year at age 28, and though he has put together some decent years since, he has never been that good again. Before signing on with the Giants, he was released by the Tampa Bay Rays. In the visitor’s clubhouse before a Giants game in Washington, I asked him if he ever fails to connect with a pitch and thinks to himself that it’s a pitch he would have crushed when he was 25. “Not really,” he said. “And to be honest with you, if I let my mind go in that direction, I don’t think I’d still be here.”Burrell said the one concession he has made to age is that he switched to a bat that is a half-inch shorter and a half-ounce lighter than what he used to use. “I don’t know if it helps. It feels like it does, especially if you’ve got to swing it 500 times a year.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Robert Adair, the “Physics of Baseball” author, writes that a batter has “just two or three blinks of the eye to see the pitch, judge the correct response and make the movements required to hit the ball squarely.” He calculates that 1/100th of a second is what separates a solidly hit line drive to center field from a late swing that fouls a ball off into the seats. So Burrell could be doing the right thing: Don’t think too much, and swing a lighter bat.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Across the locker room, I had a conversation with Tim Flannery, the Giants’ third-base coach, a solid but unspectacular infielder whose 11-year career with the San Diego Padres ended in 1989. “I was done at 32, which is a lot different than it was for some of the guys that came after me,” he began. “Knowing what we know now, they had a little help.”The end for Flannery was probably atypical in that he experienced it as something like a revelation over a Fourth of July weekend. “It was July 1, 1989, at Busch Stadium in St. Louis,” he said. “I’m playing third base, and Ozzie Smith hits a ball down on me to my right, right where I could always short-hop it and turn it into a double play. But I couldn’t get to it. The ball went off my glove and rolled down into the corner and three runs scored. I lost the game for us. And I remember calling my wife that night. She was coming back from a Fourth of July party on the beach, and she had had a couple of drinks. And she said: ‘Oh, it was the greatest party. How are you?’ And I said: ‘Didn’t you watch the game? I’m done. I’m retiring.’ And I did at the end of that season. My last game was Sept. 29, 1989.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Derek Jeter signed a three-year contract in December that will pay him $17 million a year through the season he turns 39. The talks beforehand were contentious, and Jeter made no secret of the fact that he was angry about how they went and was particularly upset that the Yankees invited him to test the free-agent market to see if some other team would meet his demands. “It was an uncomfortable position that I felt I was in,” he told reporters after the deal was signed. “It was not an enjoyable experience.”Not enjoyable? Jeter’s rare burst of public candor seemed to betray a sense of entitlement and a worldview formed within a bubble shared by other highly paid athletes and celebrities. Lots of regular people, after all, would happily endure being mildly affronted before getting a guaranteed $51 million.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Yankees management wasn’t all that happy, either. Jeter was a beloved Yankee with a significant milestone looming, his 3,000th hit. For him to get that hit in the uniform of some other team was inconceivable. Jeter and his agent forced the Yankees’ hand, pushing for a contract that compensates him, in large part, for past performance and his status as an icon rather than for what his on-field production is projected to be. (The Yankees can well afford their shortstop’s salary, which is only the sixth-highest on a team with the richest payroll in baseball. On the other hand, if the front office is giving out money as an expression of goodwill, there might be more needy beneficiaries in the New York metropolitan area than Jeter, whose expired 10-year-contract paid him about $19 million a season.)The subtext of everything, of course, was age. Jeter plays the most important defensive position on the field, one that requires the same kind of reflexes and explosive bursts that it takes to hit big-league pitching. Shortstops — and their double-play partners at second base — tend to have less productive late careers than the sluggers who play elsewhere in the field. Barry Larkin, a shortstop similar to Jeter in his skills and body type, and a probable Hall of Famer someday, is one of many examples. He retired at age 40 in 2004 but had his last good full season at age 35, followed by an injury-plagued average year the following season and then steep decline. If you look at statistics for other top middle infielders from recent decades — Joe Morgan, Ryne Sandberg, Alan Trammell, Lou Whitaker — you find similar patterns.

New baseball statistics have proliferated in recent years, yielding a more nuanced view of performance than traditional numbers like batting average, runs batted in and earned-run average do. (The difference between the old and the new statistics is akin to that between an X-ray and an M.R.I. — the new ones give more information, although sometimes more than you want or need.) New fielding statistics that have come into vogue indicate that Jeter has never been as good defensively as many fans presume — that he has fielded a high percentage of his chances cleanly but hasn’t reached as many balls as the best players at his position. With age, his “range factor” has declined further from a not-so-impressive starting point; as of mid-June, he was dead last this season in both that category and another, “zone range,” among starting major-league shortstops.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Scouts are sort of the undercover agents of baseball and will rarely consent to be quoted by name. I asked the scout I visited with in Florida about Jeter, and his answer was succinct. “His hands are not as quick,” he said. “His feet are not as quick. His overall strength is diminished.” The scout summed it up by saying, “Father Time catches up with all of us.”The most damning statistic involving Jeter is a traditional one: slugging percentage. It is what it sounds like, a measure of oomph — what a hitter’s base hits really add up to. (The equation is total bases divided by at-bats.)As a leadoff hitter, Jeter’s role is to be a so-called place setter, to get on base in front of the run producers, and he has done so impressively, with a career .314 batting average entering this season. But he didn’t just dink singles in front of outfielders. His ability to drive the ball with power and get extra-base hits created more runs for the Yankees for obvious reasons: a hitter who gets himself to second or third base is more likely to be driven home than one who hits a single. (And he drove in plenty of runs himself, an average of 75 a season.)  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  That aspect of his game is gone. Until he went on the disabled list in mid-June, his slugging percentage this year was .324, far below his career average of .449, and was 147th out of 163 big leaguers with enough plate appearances to be ranked. Among shortstops, he ranked 20th out of 24th. He was hitting just .260 and was on pace to drive in fewer than 50 runs.In addition to his steady excellence as a player, Jeter has been valued for his leadership, a quality that cannot be measured statistically but can also decline with age — even though “veteran leadership” is an ingredient most teams say they covet. But in a baseball clubhouse, as in any workplace, the person struggling at his job is not always the one you turn to for inspiration or clarity of thought. Veteran players, unsure of their own futures, sometimes view the game through their own narrow perspective and come to believe that maturity trumps production.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In mid-May, Jeter’s close friend Jorge Posada, 39 years old and hitting a paltry .165 at the time, took umbrage at being slotted ninth in the batting order and refused to play one evening, even though he was not injured and the nationally televised game was against the Boston Red Sox. But he felt insulted to be hitting so low in the order. Any fan would know that a guy with that average is lucky to be in the lineup at all. But Jeter came to Posada’s defense when reporters approached him for comment. “I ain’t lying to you,” the Yankee captain said. “If I thought he did something wrong, I would tell him.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  It was a strange statement, and one that Yankees management did not appreciate. Jeter had to participate in a conference call the next morning with the team brass that included one of the owners, the general partner Hal Steinbrenner.The prospect of this article did not sit well with the Yankees, or at least elements of its hierarchy. Jason Zillo, the team’s media director, would not grant me access to the Yankees’ clubhouse before games to do interviews. I have been a baseball beat writer, have written two baseball books and have routinely been granted clubhouse credentials for a quarter-century, as just about anyone connected to a reputable publication or broadcast outlet usually is. “We’re not interested in helping you, so why should I let you in?” Zillo said, before further explaining that he views his role as a “gatekeeper” against stories the Yankees would rather not see in print.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  I was surprised that he would deny access to The New York Times Magazine. But if I learned anything over the course of working on this article, it is that aging is a sensitive issue. It happens to everyone, but that doesn’t mean we’re comfortable with it. Jeter has become a lightning rod on the topic. We see him getting old, but we’re supposed to pretend he is just in a prolonged slump. “The reason the response to athletes’ getting older is so powerful is that the decline occurs in public,” Susan Jacoby told me. “We don’t see it when a man has trouble with an erection for the first time. Or a mathematics professor forgets something. It’s not Alzheimer’s, but it’s age, and it’s difficult. But it’s private.”I did have pregame field credentials issued by the Orioles for the series in Baltimore and was able to talk with Kevin Long, the Yankees’ hitting coach, among others. Long worked with Jeter to eliminate his stride in the spring, an initiative that was scrapped not long into April. He said Jeter’s current approach at the plate was “fine — I don’t see big issues with it.”“We’re going to see how this year goes,” Long said. “When it’s over, we may try to come up with a better way, or we’ll say, ‘We’re right where we need to be.’ And we might be. Who knows?”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mariano Rivera was sitting in the dugout, just finishing a cellphone call. At 41, he, not Jeter, is the Yankees’ ageless wonder. Pitchers initiate the action in baseball. Reflexes and fast-twitch muscle are less important. They rarely make it much past their mid-30s as top performers because their arms wear out — elbows, shoulders — but Rivera’s has not, and he remains among the game’s elite relievers.I asked him if, as a pitcher, he can sense when a hitter is trying to compensate for lost bat speed. “Of course,” he said. “They try not to let you know. They try to cheat. They will open up quicker. Try to start their swing sooner. But there is no way you don’t see it. You see where they want a pitch, and you throw it somewhere different.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Does he ever offer advice to his own hitters? “Yeah, sometimes I do. I’ll talk to them just about baseball and say: ‘You’re doing something that we as pitchers can see. You’re doing the opposite of what is maybe helping.’ ”Rivera has been Jeter’s teammate for 17 years, since 1995, when they both broke into the big leagues. “He’s doing good now,” Rivera said. “I mean, guys like that, they always find a way. All the years he’s been here, you don’t just stop doing what you’re doing in one year or two years. It doesn’t happen like that.”Jeter himself, in our one brief conversation, offered what reporters who have covered him over the years know to expect. Cordiality, but no introspection. The big house he’s building in Florida goes by another nickname, the Great Wall of Jeter, because of its impressive fence, but it could apply as well to his interactions with the press. He told me he was feeling positive about his swing. I tried to ask about adjustments he has made. What he figured might be realistic personal goals for the season. He wouldn’t go there. “That’s all I got for you, buddy,” he said.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  We are living longer. Sometimes better. The concept of the “new old age” may be overblown, but many people in their 40s, 50s and 60s would say they are more physically active than their parents were at similar ages. But there are limits that have not been breached. You may be able to write great fiction into your 70s, but it is highly unlikely, if not impossible, that you will make breakthroughs at that age in theoretical physics or mathematics, fields that seem to require a brain at top processing speed. One of the strongest arguments against raising the age at which Americans can start taking Social Security benefits is that it would penalize people who do physical labor. (Little in the modern era has made it much easier for, say, a 60-year-old hotel maid who must strip beds and scrub bathrooms for 40 hours a week.)  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Jeter has some crinkles under his eyes and a slightly receded hairline. But he still looks great — broad-shouldered and tapered, without an ounce of discernible flab. His current girlfriend is actually the second “sexiest woman alive” he has dated, in addition to a former Miss Universe. If he chose to, there is no reason he could not continue to date like that indefinitely. His on-field decline suggests the limits of physical conditioning only as they relate to the specific tasks of playing shortstop and hitting big-league pitching.Jeter may be in tip-top shape, but so is most everyone else in baseball these days. And every year he plays, he gains another year on the average age in Major League Baseball, which is currently just under 28.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Brian Cashman, the Yankees’ general manager, negotiated Jeter’s new deal. When we talked late last month, I asked Cashman if it was based more on what Jeter had accomplished or on what the team expected he would produce in the future. “People can look at it and come to their own conclusions,” he said. “The contract got done, with Derek remaining a Yankee, and hopefully we’ll win more world championships with him at shortstop.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Cashman is in a difficult position. He had to make sure Jeter stayed a Yankee. Yet he is also under pressure to produce championships with a roster that includes other older stars: Posada; Alex Rodriguez, who is 35 and under contract with the team for six more seasons after this one for an additional $143 million; and Rivera, who has to slow down at some point.  Cashman repeated a comment he had recently made on the radio — that he still considered Jeter in the top half of major-league shortstops. “He’s not the same player he used to be,” Cashman said. “But I think he’s above average at that position, despite his age.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Cashman almost surely knows that is not the case, by objective measures. But he would like it to be. So would many Yankee fans. And so might we all.   Correction: July 10, 2011   Because of an editing error, an article on June 27 about Derek Jeter and the declining abilities of aging athletes misstated part of the name of Einstein’s theory in a comparison of the ages at which high achievers in other fields had great success. It is the special theory of relativity, not the general.     Michael Sokolove is a contributing writer who last wrote for the magazine about the Baylor University basketball player Perry Jones III. His most recent book is ‘‘Warrior Girls,’’ about the injury epidemic among young female athletes.
