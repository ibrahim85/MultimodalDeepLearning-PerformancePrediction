Nothing worked.On Wednesday afternoon, the Mariners finally ended the streak, and no gimmicks or magic potions were involved. Rather, their long-sought victory came from a familiar baseball recipe: an offensive explosion mixed with a stalwart performance from their ace starting pitcher.Yankees Manager Joe Girardi had talked all series about how the Mariners were still dangerous, and Wednesday his words were proved true. Ichiro Suzuki went 4 for 5 and the Mariners pounded 17 hits to back Felix Hernandez, the reigning American League Cy Young Award winner, who pitched seven strong innings in a 9-2 Mariners victory.For the Yankees, it was just their fourth loss in the past 12 games; for the Mariners, it was their first win in 21 days.

C. Sabathia was Tuesday night, but he kept the Yankees from taking advantage of their few scoring chances.Hernandez, who has won his last five decisions against the Yankees, allowed five hits and walked four, but left the game having only given up a single run on a sacrifice fly by Derek Jeter in the fifth inning.The Mariners, on the other hand, capitalized on the openings provided by the Yankees, scoring two runs off starter Phil Hughes before breaking the game open against the bullpen. The biggest blow was a seventh-inning, three-run triple by Mike Carp, who lashed a pitch from the left-hander Boone Logan to deep center field that glanced off the tip of Curtis Granderson’s outstretched glove.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  At first glance, it appeared Granderson hesitated in his pursuit of Carp’s fly ball, but Granderson said afterward that the ball was simply hit too far.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  There was no reasonable explanation for what had happened three batters earlier, however, when Robinson Cano eschewed an easy out on Dustin Ackley’s soft ground ball and instead executed a late flip to Jeter at second base in an attempt at what would have been a very unlikely double play.

Justin Smoak then worked a walk off Logan and Carp crushed his triple two batters later, stretching a two-run Mariners lead to five.“We gave them too many outs that inning,” Girardi said. “That was the difference in the ballgame. It really changed the complexion of the game.” [{"headline":"Sports","summary":"Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, delivered to your inbox every week.","product-code":"SP","product-title":"Sports","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/sports?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=SP&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Race\/Related Newsletter","summary":"Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with New York Times journalists.","product-code":"RR","product-title":"Race Related","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/race-related?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=RR&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Your Money","summary":"Every week, get tips on retirement, paying for college, credit cards and the right way to invest.","product-code":"MY","product-title":"Your Money","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/your-money?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=business&contentId=MY&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"}]      Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Privacy Policy    Girardi added, in reference to Cano, “Robbie’s very talented and there are some special things he can do, but you probably need to get one out there.”Because of the Yankees’ fielding mishaps (Granderson also lost a ball in the sun that fell for a run-scoring double two innings later), Girardi was quick to exonerate the Yankees’ pitchers after the defeat. In particular, Girardi said, he was pleased with Hughes, whose comeback from a mysterious arm problem has been a lingering story.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “I’m not going to say that there will be,” Girardi said, “but we want our guys to compete all the time. We want guys to throw the ball well and earn their spots every time.”Hughes, who allowed seven runs in his previous start, seemed unconcerned by that possibility. “That’s how it always is,” he said. “If I go out there every time and am not good, there’s obviously going to be consequences from that, so that’s nothing new.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Certainly it is not as novel as a Mariners win, and so after the matinee, the Yankees scattered quickly, eager to get to the rest and relaxation that will carry them through Thursday’s day off.In the visitors’ clubhouse, the Mariners were more than happy to revel in a victory.“It means everything right now,” Wedge said. “These guys haven’t felt good in a long time.”INSIDE PITCHThe Yankees will activate the right-handed reliever Rafael Soriano from the disabled list before Friday’s game against Baltimore, Joe Girardi said. Soriano will not necessarily return to his eighth-inning setup role, which has been occupied by Dave Robertson. ... Alex Rodriguez, on the disabled list after knee surgery, celebrated his 36th birthday Wednesday, and Girardi said he expected Rodriguez to increase the intensity of his rehabilitation next week at the team’s minor league complex in Tampa, Fla.

3 View photosBaltimore Orioles' Vladimir Guerrero runs in to score next to Toronto Blue Jays catcher Jose Molina in the third inning of a baseball game Tuesday, July 26, 2011, in Toronto. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Frank Gunn)MoreTORONTO (AP) — A four-homer outburst gave the Baltimore Orioles something they haven't had in years: a winning streak in Toronto.J.J. Hardy homered twice, Derrek Lee and Nolan Reimold also connected and the Orioles beat the Blue Jays 12-4 on Tuesday night.It's the first time since June 6-7, 2008, that the Orioles have won consecutive games in Canada."That was something really special, especially to do that here," right-hander Jake Arrieta said. "Everybody knows we've struggled here at Rogers Centre in the past, we haven't played well in this ballpark."The Orioles had lost 16 straight north of the border before winning here on June 16. Baltimore has lost 25 of their past 29 games at Rogers Centre.It was the first multihomer game of the season for Hardy and the fifth of his career. He went 2 for 5 with four RBIs.Lee went 4 for 5 with five RBIs as Baltimore finished with season highs in runs and extra-base hits (eight)."It was one of those 'not to be denied' nights," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "Hopefully it continues."Baltimore finished with 16 hits, with every member of the starting lineup collecting at least one.Mark Reynolds was the last starter to get a hit, and shared his relief with Hardy after his two-out double in the sixth."I went out and gave him his glove (at the end of the inning) and he goes 'Phew,'" Hardy said. "I go 'What?' He goes 'I was the last one in the lineup to get a hit.' I wouldn't have known that if he didn't say it."Arrieta allowed five runs, four earned, and five hits in five innings to snap a five-start winless streak. Arrieta (10-7) walked two and struck out four to win for the first time since June 20, at Pittsburgh."It's nice to get it out of the way," Arrieta said of reaching 10 wins. "I'd like to pile on quite a few more and see where I finish the year."The last Oriole to record his 10th victory in July was left-hander Erik Bedard, who did it on July 25, 2007.Arrieta left after being hit on the right foot by Edwin Encarnacion's liner in the fifth inning. X-rays were negative.Jose Bautista, who leads the majors with 31 homers, left in the third after he was hit in the helmet by a pitch from Arrieta. He fell to the ground after being hit on the earflap with an 0-2 pitch.Toronto's trainers and manager John Farrell rushed to Bautista's side as he remained on the dirt at home plate. He got to his knees and stayed there for a couple of minutes before walking off without assistance. He was replaced by John McDonald.Bautista said he had no lingering effects and hoped to be in the lineup Wednesday."I'm fine, I'm not hurt," he said. "My head doesn't hurt, I'm not dizzy. I feel perfectly fine."Arrieta called the incident "really scary" and said he asked Toronto's trainers to pass along his wishes to Bautista when he went for his X-rays."I felt terrible right after the fact," Arrieta said. "I was trying to elevate a fastball away and that was one of those pitches that got away from me."I asked (the trainers) to please let Jose know that I was thinking about him and just wanted to know that he was OK," Arrieta said. "Obviously there was zero intent on my part."Toronto's Adam Lind hit a three-run shot, homering against Baltimore for the fifth consecutive game, and Aaron Hill added a solo drive, but it wasn't enough for the Blue Jays.Jason Berken pitched three scoreless innings and Mark Hendrickson finished for the Orioles.The Orioles roughed up Blue Jays right-hander Brandon Morrow (7-5), spoiling his 27th birthday.Morrow came in 2-0 in three career games against Baltimore and 5-0 with a 2.85 ERA in his last seven starts overall, but failed to get out of the fourth. He allowed seven runs, six earned, and nine hits in 3 1-3 innings, walked one and struck out five to lose for the first time since June 11 against Boston."I just wasn't very good tonight," Morrow said. "I was pulling a lot of fastballs to the first-base side of the box. And then if I wasn't throwing my slider in the dirt, then I was spinning it at the top of the hitting zone."Hardy hit a leadoff homer to left in the third and added a two-run drive to left in the fourth, his 15th and 16th homers. He hit a sacrifice fly to the warning track in the fifth.Lee hit a two-run double in the second, added an RBI single in the third and homered off Casey Janssen in the eighth, his 11th.Reimold homered to begin the fourth, his sixth, and added an RBI double in the fifth. Robert Andino doubled home a run for the Orioles.Lind cut Toronto's deficit to 4-3 with a drive to center off Arrieta in the third, his 19th. Baltimore answered with three runs in the fourth before Hill opened the bottom half with a solo shot to left, his fifth.NOTES: Orioles DH Vladimir Guerrero was activated off the 15-day DL after missing 10 games with a broken bone in his right wrist, and RHP Mark Worrell was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk. ... Baltimore LHP Zach Britton will be called up from the minors to start the second game of Saturday's doubleheader at Yankee Stadium. ... Orioles OF Luke Scott had season-ending surgery on his right shoulder Tuesday. ... Lind has homered six times in his past five games against the Orioles.

But in reality, the only guy that they really needed was on the mound, and aside from one inning, talented left-hander Ricky Romero didn't give the Orioles much of a chance. A night after their best offensive output of the season, the Orioles were held to just four hits by Romero, who pitched 8 1/3 shutout innings in a 3-0 win over the Orioles in front of an announced 16,861 at Rogers Centre. var adSkipCounter = 0;  "That's baseball," said Orioles right fielder Nick Markakis, trying to explain how a team looks so dangerous offensively one night, and so overmatched the next. "The guy pitched his butt off on the mound. We could have had him early, but we let him off the hook. When you do that against good pitchers and they get in a groove, it's tough to battle back the rest of the game." The Orioles (41-59) did bring the tying run to the plate with one out in the ninth inning, but Blue Jays closer Jon Rauch, who entered after Romero hit Derrek Lee with a pitch, retired Matt Wieters on a first-pitch lineout, and then Mark Reynolds on a flyout to end the game. The Orioles went 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position and stranded seven runners in getting shutout for the fourth time this season, three of them coming over their past 14 games. They've also scored just three runs during Alfredo Simon's past four starts. "I still thought that if it stayed at three, we'd make a run at them," said Orioles manager Buck Showalter. "We brought the tying run to the plate and Mark just missed that last ball. But little things add up." The little things that Showalter spoke of included Simon allowing two more two-out runs over his five uneven innings, the Orioles not scoring despite having men on first and second and nobody out in the second, and Lee failing to score from third on a Romero pitch that got past Blue Jays catcher J.P. Arencibia and went straight to the backstop. Instead of immediately reacting and heading home, Lee got a late break and then froze before returning to third. The run would have tied the game at one in the second inning and certainly made a comeback more plausible with Simon and three relievers (Chris Jakubauskas, Troy Patton and Kevin Gregg) keeping the Orioles' deficit at three runs. "It was a tough read down there, one you'd like to see him make," Showalter said. Losing in Toronto for the 22nd time in the past 25 tries, the Orioles will get one more chance to break a seven-series winless streak and win their first series since June 24-26 in tonight's series finale. By then, the Blue Jays roster will be at full strength. Striking four days before the trade deadline, the Blue Jays acquired talented outfielder Colby Rasmus and three pitchers from the St. Louis Cardinals for starter Edwin Jackson, relievers Octavio Dotel and Marc Rzepczynski, and former Orioles outfielder Corey Patterson. Jackson, the main piece heading to St. Louis, was acquired earlier in the day, along with infielder Mark Teahen, from the Chicago White Sox for reliever Jason Frasor and prospect Zach Stewart. Dotel, Rzepczynski and Frasor were in the bullpen and Patterson started in left field a night earlier when the Orioles tallied season-highs in runs (12) and extra-base hits (eight). The thought process was that if the Orioles could get to Romero early and get into Toronto's depleted bullpen, they would be in great shape. Even with Simon struggling early, allowing RBI singles to Jose Bautista and Eric Thames in the first and second innings and a homer to Arencibia in the fourth, the Orioles still had hope that could happen. But Romero never allowed it to, getting a big double-play ball off the bat of Reynolds with runners on first and second and no outs in the second, and then retiring Blake Davis with runners on the corners and two outs after Lee failed to come home on the ball that got by Arencibia. "He was pretty good," said Davis who was a former roommate and teammate of Romero's at Cal-State Fullerton. "He's coming at you with all his pitches and he battles. That's what he does. He works hard. That's why they're paying him what they're paying him." Romero's pitch count was at 41 after two innings and 56 after three, but he got on a stretch where he retired 12 of the 14 hitters that he faced with the exception of Adam Jones' two-out double in the third and Jones' one-out single in the sixth. Vladimir Guerrero left him stranded both times, first with a groundout to shortstop and then with a double-play ball. Romero, who threw 126 pitches, struck out nine, including five of the final nine hitters that he faced. Four of those strikeouts came against J.J. Hardy, who hit two homers and drove in four the previous night. Romero is 5-1 in his past seven starts against the Orioles. In two starts against them at the Rogers Centre this season, Romero has allowed just one earned run, seven hits and seven walks while striking out 21 over 16 1/3 innings. "He doesn't throw anything straight," Markakis said. "The ball cuts, it sinks. He puts it where he wants it. When you're doing that, you don't really need much off-speed. Even when it seemed to be over the plate, it was either cutting or sinking. Off a guy like that who is throwing 90 to 94, it makes it tough." jeff.zrebiec@baltsun.com     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: 'thumbnails-f',     container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives',     placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives',     target_type: 'mix'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed'Blushing' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn't to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.
