Curtis Granderson asked reporters for weather updates. A. J. Burnett climbed the steps leading to the Yankees’ clubhouse and said with a shrug, “Still raining.”It was a familiar scene Friday night for the Yankees, who had a game, this one against the Orioles, rained out for the third time in 17 days. The game has not been rescheduled, which also fits the theme of their season. Unlike the Mets, who endured two doubleheaders in three days last week, the Yankees have yet to play any of their makeup games. Eventually, they will experience the effects of the scheduling logjam, and days off will be lost.“We don’t like it because we know that they’re going to probably be split doubleheaders, and that makes it tough,” Manager Joe Girardi said. “It makes it tough on your bullpen and it makes it tough on your guys, but what are you going to do?”The three rainouts combined with four scheduled days off have protected the Yankees’ bullpen, which has bailed out a rotation that has worked the fewest innings in baseball (851/3), and several position players who otherwise would have been rested during this stretch. Barring additional rainouts, the Yankees are set to play the next 16 days before a break May 9, and 32 of the next 33. That means Girardi will ultimately have to address an issue that, for the moment, has been neutralized. Several times he has hinted about resting Jeter more, in recognition of his advancing age, and he intended to sit him April 5 against Minnesota until — you guessed it — rain intervened.

No. But I’ve started looking at things already.” Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Just as he likes it, Jeter has played all but two of the Yankees’ 1442/3 innings this season, sitting out the final two innings of their second game, on April 2, because they were leading by seven runs. Jeter was one of four shortstops to start at least 150 games last season, when he hit a career-low .270. Jeter’s struggles have continued, with a .219 average and just 1 of his 14 hits going for extra bases, but he is hardly tired. Still, despite his competitiveness, Jeter says he understands that receiving days off during long stretches — or the hotter weather of summer — could help him.

Privacy Policy    “The more teams you keep involved in the races, the better for baseball,” said Joe Girardi, who also expressed concern that too many days off immediately after the season could be a disadvantage to the division winners. Girardi thought that adding another playoff team, and thus an extra series, would compel contending teams to pursue the division title instead of settling for the wild card.

This year’s playoffs are assured of ending in October.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In three of the last four seasons, one-game playoffs have been required to determine playoff spots, and Granderson, who played for Detroit in a one-game playoff against Minnesota in 2009, wondered how those games would be scheduled. From a competitive standpoint, Derek Jeter said he liked the concept, as long as division winners were rewarded, but he shared Girardi’s concern of having too long a layoff between playoff games.“In theory, it sounds like a good idea,” Jeter said, “but I think a lot of kinks would have to be worked out first.”HUGHES WAITS A DAY The steady rain Friday afternoon forced Phil Hughes to push back his scheduled bullpen session to Saturday, when he planned to throw three simulated 15-pitch innings. If the Yankees sense that his arm strength has sufficiently improved, Hughes could begin a minor-league rehabilitation assignment next week. ... C. C. Sabathia will pitch Saturday, but the Yankees have yet to decide whether Freddy Garcia or Ivan Nova will start Sunday. ... The Yankees recalled the veteran right-hander Buddy Carlyle from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to replace Hector Noesi, who did not pitch in 10 days with the team.

New York returns to Baltimore from May 18-19 and Aug. 26-29.Brad Bergesen, who was scheduled to pitch for Baltimore on Friday, will instead start Saturday. CC Sabathia will start for New York.Right-hander Chris Tillman, Sunday's scheduled starter, will be skipped in the rotation because of groin tightness. Jake Arrieta will start instead, and Tillman will be available as a reliever."We'll take this opportunity to try to clear that up," Showalter said of Tillman's injury "It looks like we'll stay in line before everybody else, but don't hold me to that with the off day (on Monday)."Tillman first felt discomfort in his right groin during his last start, Monday against Minnesota."He's had it a couple times. He felt OK, good enough to pitch on Sunday, but now that we've got this opportunity to clean it up," Showalter said. "He could pitch out of the bullpen during that period. It's Saturday of next week before we need a fifth guy."The Orioles' rotation has been in shambles since before opening day. Brian Matusz and Justin Duchscherer are on the disabled list, although Showalter said Friday that Matusz is beginning to make strides in his effort to return from a strained left intercoastal muscle (which is near the ribs)."Matusz threw today," Showalter said Friday afternoon. "It went well. That's encouraging. No discomfort at all. He'll take a day off and do it again on Sunday. Take Monday off and hopefully progress to some form of a mound on Tuesday."Without getting too far ahead of ourselves, hopefully that's the start of him getting on the rubber. But today was very encouraging."New York came to town as the only team in the AL East with a winning record (10-6). The Orioles started the night tied for third with an 8-10 record.

Tillman, who was originally scheduled to start Saturday night, has been dealing with right groin soreness. Brad Bergesen, who was expected to start Friday before the rains came, will now take the ball Saturday opposite Yankees ace CC Sabathia. Jake Arrieta will be on the mound Sunday with the Yankees deciding between Freddy Garcia and Ivan Nova to start the series finale. Following Monday's offday, the Orioles will finish their home stand with a three-game series against the Boston Red Sox. Zach Britton and Jeremy Guthrie will start the first two games, though Orioles manager Buck Showalter hasn't decided the order in which they'll pitch. Bergesen would come back on normal rest and start Thursday's series and home-stand finale, pushing Tillman's next start until next Saturday at the earliest. var adSkipCounter = 0;  "He's had it a couple times," Showalter said of Tillman's groin issues. "He felt good enough, we felt like, to pitch on Saturday. But now that we've got this opportunity, we've been talking about it and make sure we get it all the way taken care of." Showalter said that Tillman, who is 0-2 with a 6.16 ERA and gave up six runs in 1 2/3 innings when he faced the Yankees on April 13, would be available in the bullpen for the next couple of days. The club had been concerned enough about Tillman's status that it considered holding back Triple-A left-hander Mike Ballard from starting Friday with the idea that he'd start Saturday. However, the rainout made that a moot point. It's the second time in a 10-day span where the series opener between the Orioles and Yankees has been rained out. The first was on April 12 in New York. A make-up date has not been announced for either game, but Friday's will likely be made up in late August as part of a scheduled four-game series between the two clubs at Camden Yards. The Yankees are in town again in mid-May, but it's only a two-game set. Izturis: Andino deserves to play When the season started, it was believed that if J.J. Hardy needed a day off or was absent from the lineup for any extended period, Cesar Izturis would assume the starting shortstop job that he held for the previous two seasons. However, that's not how it has played out since Hardy went on the disabled list with a strained left oblique. Robert Andino has started at shortstop in six of the 10 games during Hardy's absence. Izturis, the 31-year-old veteran who re-signed with the club in January, not only has not griped about it, but he's endorsed the move. "It doesn't bother me at all," said Izturis, who has started at shortstop in just five of the Orioles' 18 games. "Definitely, I want to play and I believe I'll have a chance to play. We'll see what happens. But he deserves to play. He's been doing a great job. It's fair. You play good, you deserve to play." Andino was in the lineup as the starting shortstop for a fifth straight game before Friday's rainout. He's batting .308 and has hit safely in four of the past five games, including three straight multi-hit games during that stretch. However, Showalter maintained that Izturis will still get his share of at-bats, and he praised the veteran's influence on Andino and the rest of the club. "Izzy is like having a seventh coach. He gets it, he understands the game. He's going to do this for a long time when he quits playing," Showalter said. "He's going to help us on the field, in the clubhouse or in the dugout. He's locked into every pitch. I can always go down there and bounce something off him from a player's perspective, and he's great for all our players. He's a voice of reality. If you want to hear what you need to hear, not what you want to hear, Izzy is the guy to go to. He's sharp, really sharp. You know what I think of him. He's pretty special people. He's actually played pretty well for us, too. He's not some ceremonial whatever. He's going to play." Big day for Matusz Orioles starter Brian Matusz, who hasn't pitched yet this season because of a strained left intercostal muscle, had a pain-free flat ground session Friday, throwing from as far as 120 feet. Matusz will take Saturday off, throw from flat ground again Sunday and possibly graduate to a bullpen session from off the mound Tuesday. "Without getting too far ahead of ourselves, hopefully that's the start of him getting on the rubber," Showalter said. "Today was very encouraging." Slimmed down Simon still in plans Right-handed pitcher Alfredo Simon, who was jailed in the Dominican Republic for more than two months as the chief suspect in a fatal shooting on New Year's Day, has pitched in two extended spring training games for the Orioles. Showalter said that Simon, who has lost 30 pounds since last year, went two innings in his previous outing and will go three in his next appearance as the club continues to stretch him out to be a starter. Around the horn Showalter said that Hardy is "getting close" to starting baseball activities, but he definitely won't be ready to return when he's eligible to come off the disabled list April 26. … Pitcher Mitch Atkins, who missed just about all of spring training with an oblique injury, is scheduled to make a rehab appearance Saturday for Single-A Frederick. … Arrieta, Britton and Guthrie visited nearly 20 patients at Johns Hopkins Hospital on Friday morning. … Guthrie on Friday organized a bike ride to the ballpark with Arrieta, Matusz, Bergesen, Jeremy Accardo, Kevin Gregg and former Oriole Rick Dempsey in celebration of Earth Day. Guthrie also was prepared to break out a green glove during batting practice. jeff.zrebiec@baltsun.com twitter.com/jeffzrebiecsun      window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: 'thumbnails-f',     container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives',     placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives',     target_type: 'mix'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed'Blushing' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn't to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.
