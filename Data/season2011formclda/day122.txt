His finger is not broken, and Jeter, not surprisingly, said he was hurting but fine.“You get hit in the same spot twice, and it’s going to hurt a little bit more,” Jeter said after the Yankees won their third game in 27 hours, beating the Baltimore Orioles once again, 4-2.Jeter left Sunday’s game in the fourth inning, an inning after he was hit by an errant pitch from Orioles starter Jake Arrieta. Arrieta struggled with his control throughout his five innings, walking six batters. And when he hit Jeter, it was on the same finger Jeter injured while fielding a ball in the night game of Saturday’s doubleheader.He said he would return when he could hit and throw, perhaps Monday, when the Yankees play the White Sox in Chicago. But the Yankees showed again that they could win with anyone in the field — even a backup catcher at second base — when their veteran pitchers are precise. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The 35-year-old right-hander Freddy Garcia (10-7), who scrambled to make the team in spring training, pitched six effective innings, allowing two runs and five hits while striking out six with curveballs and split-finger fastballs the Orioles mostly lunged at.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “He seems to be able to relax in the big moments, the tough moments,” Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said of Garcia, who has allowed only 17 earned runs in his last nine starts.Garcia and the 38-year-old Bartolo Colon have been so good this season that Brian Cashman, the Yankees’ general manager, did not feel a need to acquire a starting pitcher by the nonwaiver trading deadline at 4 p.m. Eastern on Sunday.Including Ivan Nova, who was called up from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and pitched seven strong innings Saturday night in a 17-3 victory over Baltimore, the Yankees actually have one too many starting pitchers. It does not sound as if Garcia will lose his job.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “He knows how to pitch,” Cashman said of Garcia. “He’s not afraid. Those are two important aspects when you place yourself in this market.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees did not muster much offense Sunday, scoring all of their runs in the fourth inning. As Jeter had his finger examined, Brett Gardner drilled a pitch from Arrieta (10-8) down the right-field line for a three-run triple. He scored on Curtis Granderson’s groundout.

Credit             Uli Seit for The New York Times           Garcia gave up one run in the third inning on an infield single by Adam Jones and another in the sixth on Vladimir Guerrero’s single, but that was it. He has pitched at least six innings and allowed three runs or fewer in eight of his last nine starts.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “Freddy pitched great, and that was all we needed,” Gardner said. “He stayed ahead and looked as good as he has all year.”That may be partly because Sunday’s game was played in brilliant sunshine. Mariano Rivera, who earned his 27th save by pitching a spotless ninth inning, said the Yankees would be even better off if Garcia just pitched every day game on the schedule.

This is no recent trend: entering Sunday, he was 54-23 with a 3.63 E.R.A. in day games, compared with an 88-71 record and a 4.32 E.R.A. in night games.

Hector Noesi replaced him and got two outs in the seventh before allowing a single to Robert Andino. With a 1-0 count on Baltimore’s leadoff hitter, J. J. Hardy, Girardi summoned Dave Robertson.Robertson got Hardy to bounce out to end the inning, and he struck out Nick Markakis, Adam Jones and Guerrero in the eighth inning to set up Rivera, who ended the game by getting the Orioles to hit a soft liner and two fly balls.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “I was just trying to mix them up and throw a lot of fastballs there,” Robertson said.But Robertson said Garcia was the difference. The Yankees did fine without Jeter, who was replaced by a pinch-hitter, Francisco Cervelli, in the fourth inning. Eduardo Nunez, the starting second baseman, replaced Jeter at shortstop, and Cervelli replaced Nunez.Cervelli is the Yankees’ reserve catcher, and he could not recall ever playing second base. Girardi put Cervelli there because he did not want to lose his designated hitter, Robinson Cano, by moving him to second base. Cervelli handled one chance cleanly in two innings.

He said, ‘Play second base,’ and I said, ‘O.K.’ ”Cervelli smiled when he said: “I tried to be relaxed, and that’s it. Now I can say I played second base in the big leagues for the Yankees.”INSIDE PITCHAlex Rodriguez, who missed his 20th game Sunday after having surgery on his right knee, is expected to see a doctor Monday before starting a rehabilitation assignment in Tampa, Fla. “I think once he gets going, it shouldn’t take that long,” Joe Girardi said.

Every team, that is, except the Yankees.The nonwaiver trading deadline passed at 4 p.m., just before the Yankees dispatched the Baltimore Orioles, 4-2, to pull their winning percentage above .600. For the first time since 1998, the Yankees made no trades in July. Christmas morning came, and the pinstriped stocking was empty.If it felt strange to General Manager Brian Cashman, he did not say. Cashman is obliged to explore every possibility, but this time there was little motivation to act.“Despite the anxiety the marketplace can create,” Cashman said, “and the demands that we have as an organization to always want the best you can possibly have, at some point you also have to reflect that what you’ve got is pretty good.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  What he’s got is a team that is 64-42, two games behind the Boston Red Sox in the American League East. More important, the Yankees lead the Los Angeles Angels by six and a half games in the wild-card standings. Until baseball penalizes wild-card teams in any meaningful way, getting to the postseason is all that matters.

In a few weeks, Alex Rodriguez should return from knee surgery to fortify the lineup. And the rotation, Cashman insists, is not as shaky as people think.

He deserves better than an 8-9 record.Bartolo Colon, Freddy Garcia and Ivan Nova have all made at least 16 starts. Each has a winning record. Collectively, they have a 3.49 earned run average. Is it so hard to imagine that two could hold their own in a playoff game?

But the market offered few alternatives to a staff with just one struggling member, Phil Hughes.

Houston held onto Wandy Rodriguez, but the Yankees had no interest in absorbing his contract and bringing him to the rugged A.L. East.They had doubts about Jimenez’s shoulder and, in any case, would not part with the asking price of Nova, the Class AA starter Dellin Betances and the Class AAA catcher Jesus Montero, who is hitting .283 with 10 homers for Scranton. Before this season, Baseball America ranked Montero as the third-best prospect in baseball.

Let’s put it this way, if Montero was traded at this trade deadline, he would have been the best player moved of anyone at the deadline, prospect-wise.” Photo       Brian Cashman stood by Freddy Garcia and the rotation, which has a combined 3.47 E.R.A.

Teams fixated on the Yankees’ talent at the higher levels, Cashman said, and the Yankees chose to keep it for themselves.

He could be a late-season force if he progresses quickly this month, and without Pedro Feliciano and Damaso Marte, the Yankees could use another bullpen lefty. Banuelos was off limits in trades.“I’m willing to do a deal,” Cashman said. “And as you’ve seen in the Curtis Granderson deal, we’ll pay a price and the players we’ll give, they’re good. But at the same time, it’s got to be a workable deal for all sides. It wasn’t in the cards.” [{"headline":"Sports","summary":"Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, delivered to your inbox every week.","product-code":"SP","product-title":"Sports","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/sports?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=SP&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Race\/Related Newsletter","summary":"Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with New York Times journalists.","product-code":"RR","product-title":"Race Related","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/race-related?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=RR&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Your Money","summary":"Every week, get tips on retirement, paying for college, credit cards and the right way to invest.","product-code":"MY","product-title":"Your Money","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/your-money?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=business&contentId=MY&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"}]      Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The exception might have been Jimenez, but he must reverse a troubling yearlong dip in performance. His bargain contract was more important to the small-market Indians than to the Yankees.The Yankees are spending more than $200 million on their roster, and they did not want to shed prospects for cosmetic moves. If a useful player slips through waivers in August, the Yankees could still patch a hole.

Bereswill)MoreNEW YORK (AP) — Orioles first baseman Derrek Lee has been traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates.The Orioles say they have sent Lee to Pittsburgh for minor-league first baseman Aaron Baker.Lee can give the surprising Pirates a smooth-fielding first baseman with a capable right-handed bat, two things Pittsburgh could use as it tries to stay close in a crowded NL Central race.After a slow start in Baltimore, Lee has come on of late. He is batting .246 with 12 homers and 41 RBIs this season.Following a 17-3 loss to the New York Yankees, several Orioles teammates came over to Lee at his locker to ask about the trade and say goodbye with a hug or handshake.Baltimore says Baker will be assigned to Class A Frederick.
