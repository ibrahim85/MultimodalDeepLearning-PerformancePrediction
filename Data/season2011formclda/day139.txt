Davis injured, third baseman figures to be regular in starting lineupAugust 17, 2011|By Jeff Zrebiec, The Baltimore Sun Delmonico, who was part of four state championship teams at Farragut High in Tennessee, had plenty of baseball role models growing up. His father, Rod, was the University of Tennessee's longtime baseball coach. His older brother, Tony, played on Florida State's College World Series team in 2008 before joining the Los Angeles Dodgers' organization. Another older brother, Joey, is heading into his senior season at Georgia, where Nicky Delmonico was planning to go before he decided to sign with the Orioles. "I grew up in the dugout at Tennessee, and I saw so many players come through and what it took to be successful," he said. "I learned a lot of things that I was very blessed to see when I was young. I think that helped me later on. It takes a lot of hard work. I'm going to try and stay humble as much as I can. I feel like I'm a great leader, a positive leader, a great teammate. Every time I get on the field, I'm going to give everything I have that day and really try to take in the moment." Around the horn J.J. Hardy's first-inning single broke an 0-for-18 slump. He was lifted from the game from the ninth inning for a pinch runner, and Showalter described him as a little "dead-legged." However, Hardy said his ankle is fine, though he acknowledged he's excited for the day off. … Nick Markakis' sixth-inning homer was his 13th of the season, surpassing his total from last season. … Second baseman Brian Roberts saw concussion specialist Dr. Michael Collins in Pittsburgh. Roberts said it was just a checkup, and neither he nor team officials expected any major developments. var adSkipCounter = 0;  jeff.zrebiec@baltsun.com twitter.com/jeffzrebiecsun Orioles Insider | Live scores | Photos | Baseball appPrev | 1 | 2     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: 'thumbnails-f',     container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives',     placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives',     target_type: 'mix'   });  MORE:Arundel's Hibbs loses scholarship to Florida State after drug arrestHow a prominent black cemetery diedHow the city's nickname came to beAre you setting S.M.A.R.T. goals?Trying to clarify convection settingsThe old oyster R-month rule
