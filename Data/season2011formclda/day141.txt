Dozens followed as teams moved more of their games from free broadcast stations to cable.Now, these cable networks have grown so big that they have evolved into the primary local outlets on which to see professional teams play and increasingly powerful factors in an array of major sports deals.They are, for instance, critical in the sales of professional teams and the financial growth of college conferences. And one such network is at the center of the dispute with Major League Baseball that led the Los Angeles Dodgers to tumble into bankruptcy.Another was deemed so valuable by the Mets that their owners refused to part with a piece of it when they decided they urgently needed cash. They decided, instead, to sell a part of the actual team.

From Terry Baker to Matt Leinart, the conference’s universities produced nine Heisman Trophy winners. Games were seen on national networks and local channels, a formula long followed by college athletic conferences.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But Larry Scott, the conference’s commissioner, recently recognized that it could do much better. He decided to maximize television revenue by using natural regional rivalries among his conference’s universities to create an entire matrix of regional networks. One network went to U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. and another to Oregon and Oregon State. A third went to Washington and Washington State, a fourth to Arizona and Arizona State and a fifth to Stanford and California. A sixth will feature Colorado and Utah, whose additions turned the Pac-10 into the Pac-12 but have no historic rivalry.

It’s tribal.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Scott, if he might be the most ambitious in his exploitation of these regional networks, was hardly the first. He found his television template in the four-year-old network of the Big Ten Conference.Scott’s first trick was to secure a standard television deal, with two media giants that were eager to stay in business with the Pac-12 and could ensure a large, reliable flow of cash.ESPN and Fox Sports signed 12-year deals worth $3 billion which let Scott go for more. He carved out enough football and men’s and women’s basketball games from the ESPN and Fox deals to allow him to construct his six rivalry-based cable networks. The conference will own 100 percent of the six regional networks as well as a separate national one.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “The networks will be profitable from Day 1,” Scott said.The average regional sports network in 2010 had revenue of $137.8 million, reported SNL Kagan, a leading research firm. Atop the list was the Yankees’ YES Network, at $435.2 million. But the Big Ten’s take was hardly chump change — $227.1 million.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Indeed, the lucrative nature of regional networks for certain individual colleges can be intimidating enough to force rivals to contemplate radical action.For instance, the University of Texas, in an effort to exert its influence, created the Longhorn Network. The network is entirely owned by ESPN — which also owns the conference’s TV rights — and will pay the university at least $10.9 million annually. The network, which goes on the air Aug. 26, has riled some of the Longhorns’ rivals in the Big 12 Conference. And one, Texas A&M, views it with enough suspicion to consider leaving the conference, though its bid to join the Southeastern Conference has ended for now.

A personal injury lawyer known for litigating asbestos cases, Angelos feared that he would lose business to the team, now the Nationals, if he shared the Baltimore market with them. It was clear to baseball that he would sue if he was not placated.The solution, reached after six months of negotiations, was an unusual one that proved just how valuable regional networks had become. It featured the creation of a new network, solely to make Angelos happy. Or at least mollified.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “If we hadn’t reached a resolution with him, there is no doubt in my mind he would have sued,” said Bob DuPuy, baseball’s former president and chief operating officer. “He told my people he would sue and his professional background suggested that he was willing to sue.”The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network, then, was formed to carry the Orioles and the Nationals. Angelos got 90 percent of the network, an interest that is being diminished a bit each year, and $75 million from baseball for a 10 percent stake that it gave to the Nationals. But Angelos’s stake will never go below two-thirds.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Marc Ganis, a sports consultant who advised Angelos, said that Angelos was astonished at how lucrative a regional network could be. He recalled showing Angelos a sheet of paper estimating the fees from subscribers that could be reaped from a regional network with two teams. “I went through the numbers and assumptions with him line by line, which he challenged until he was satisfied they were correct,” Ganis said.

Hong/Associated Press           SNL Kagan estimated that the network’s revenue should hit $158.7 million this year.Sometimes even the threat to create one’s own network can constitute great leverage for a professional sports team.

Fox’s willingness to pay so much arose from its desire to keep the Rangers and the Dallas Mavericks from starting a network with Comcast.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Fox even floated a rumor that it wanted to buy the Rangers to make sure it held on to the TV rights.Focus on DodgersThe story lines this season concerning the Los Angeles Dodgers have only incidentally been about the skills of the rookie manager Don Mattingly or the terrific season of center fielder Matt Kemp.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Instead, the dominant themes in 2011 for the once-storied franchise, which plays in an aging gem of a stadium, have been the club’s descent into bankruptcy and a local TV melodrama involving Fox Sports’s ability to keep televising Dodgers games on Prime Ticket, one of its two Los Angeles regional networks.The tale, really, is one of mutual desperation: the team’s need for cash and Fox’s need to keep the Dodgers from leaving.The drama began last year when Frank McCourt, the Dodgers’ owner, contemplated starting a regional network anchored by the team after his deal with the Prime Ticket ended in 2013. It was a bold notion, and Fox was concerned about the threat. The Dodgers were a vital presence on their network. The network was about to lose its future rights to carry the Lakers on Fox Sports West, its other regional channel.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But in the wake of his nasty divorce proceedings and a severe cash crunch, McCourt, rather than taking on Fox, turned to the network, which was willing to help save him — and help itself.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Fox paid McCourt an advance on his 2011 rights, loaned him $30 million and would have gone further but Commissioner Bud Selig, eager to be rid of McCourt, rejected its offer to let McCourt borrow $200 million more. McCourt insisted that Selig’s animosity toward him — he cited as evidence Selig’s rejection of Fox’s offer to buy the team’s cable rights for 17 years for at least $2 billion, with $385 million upfront — caused the team’s bankruptcy.But McCourt now has a financial breather of sorts, if he stays afloat long enough to capitalize on it.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  A bankruptcy court judge has approved baseball’s plan to lend the Dodgers $150 million through November 2012, which could let McCourt do what Selig told him he should have all along: sell his future TV rights in a competitive market.And in an auction between Fox and Time Warner Cable, which will reportedly pay the Lakers as much as $3 billion over 20 years starting in 2012, the Dodgers could be big winners.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “If the Lakers are getting $2 million to $2.5 million a game for about 70 games a season,” said Lee Berke, a TV consultant, “imagine what the Dodgers could generate with 130 to 150 games?”Asset for the MetsFred Wilpon and Saul Katz, the owners of the Mets, had long insisted they had no interest in selling their team, or any portion of it, for any reason. It was a family treasure, and the idea was to keep it wholly owned well into the future.Then the men were seriously short of cash and were hit by $1 billion lawsuit by the trustee for the victims of Bernard L. Madoff’s fraud.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Wilpon and Katz made a choice, and a revealing one. They would sell a piece of their cherished team. What they would not sell was a piece of their cable network. And the reasons were fairly stark: the Mets lose money (maybe as much as $70 million this year); the network that carries their games mints it.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The network, known as SNY, and Citi Field, the ballpark that opened in 2009, were the twin foundations of cash that Wilpon and Katz envisioned in the early part of the century. They paid $54 million to escape their TV contract with MSG to form SNY with their partners, Comcast and Time Warner Cable, and they financed the ballpark mostly with tax-exempt bonds.But while revenue from Citi Field has fallen because of the Mets’ poor on-field performance the last three seasons, SNY’s flow of subscriber revenue steadily rises. SNY’s total revenue, including advertising, reached $227.7 million last year, according to SNL Kagan.David Einhorn, the hedge-fund manager and Mets fan who agreed in May to buy a third of the club, knew how lucrative SNY was and how unprofitable the team was. In a deal that has not been finalized, he agreed to pay $200 million for his third of the club.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  At the time, he said, “I’m not really interested in owning a TV station.”These days, in the rush to regional sports network riches, Einhorn is a throwback.
