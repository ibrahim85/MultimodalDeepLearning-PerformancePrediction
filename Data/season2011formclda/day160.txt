Keeping in the spirit of 10 errors in 20 often torturous innings over 18 waterlogged hours, Andino dropped the ball. Curtis Granderson sprinted hard to second base, then dived.Had Granderson arrived before Andino’s throw, the Yankees would have tied the score in the 11th inning Wednesday afternoon, and the game would have unthinkably dragged on. Andino fumbled for the ball, but recovered, got the force play at second just barely and thus mercifully ended the Orioles’ mud-splotched 5-4 victory, which was witnessed by only the hardiest of Yankee fans.These two teams, who seem to be followed everywhere by rain clouds, now move on to Baltimore, where they are to play — what else — a makeup game Thursday afternoon left over from Hurricane Irene. They leave behind two games played in less than one day that were certainly memorable, but mostly for the wrong reasons.“It was disgusting, it was sloppy as it gets,” the Yankees’ Alex Rodriguez said of Wednesday’s game, which didn’t start that long after Tuesday’s late-night adventure ended.

The conditions on Wednesday afternoon were nowhere near as bad as they were on Tuesday night, when the Yankees survived the elements to beat the Orioles, 5-3, in a game that started four hours late and concluded at 2:15 a.m. in a virtually empty ballpark that more or less resembled the inside of a dishwasher.

But he was back in the lineup on Wednesday, along with a lot of the Yankees’ junior varsity, in a game that went on and on, lasting 4 hours 23 minutes. This time, the crowd had swelled to maybe 10,000 fans. Photo       Curtis Granderson walked back to the dugout after Eric Chavez grounded into a fielder's choice to end the game.  Credit             Uli Seit for The New York Times           Back-to-back games in a virtually empty Yankee Stadium is not what anyone is used to, but that’s exactly what occurred.“We have to get these games in, but that’s not baseball weather, man,” the Yankees’ Nick Swisher said after the second game, which ended the Yankees’ six-game winning streak.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Tuesday’s late-night game was surreal. Wednesday afternoon’s game had more of the feel of a spring training scrimmage, with Manager Joe Girardi holding five starters out of his lineup: Granderson, Derek Jeter, Mark Teixeira, Robinson Cano and Brett Gardner.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The last three batters in the Yankees’ order were first baseman Brandon Laird, center fielder Greg Golson and second baseman Ramiro Pena. Eduardo Nunez played shortstop instead of Jeter and led off. Nunez went 0 for 4 and made two errors, but he was hardly the only player to look foolish.

Burnett failed to get his foot anywhere near the first-base bag while trying to convert a double-play toss from second and was rewarded with a sarcastic cheer from the fans. Nunez and Rodriguez watched a third-inning infield pop-up plop to the turf between them.“We still had opportunities to win the game, but we just didn’t do it,” Girardi said.Burnett, who allowed four runs and seven hits in six innings, said he regretted only one of his 108 pitches: a 3-1 sinker that Baltimore right fielder Nolan Reimold belted into the seats for a two-run homer that gave the Orioles a 4-2 lead in the third inning. Meanwhile, Burnett’s curveball had so much bite that he threw three wild pitches.

Credit             Uli Seit for The New York Times           Although there were the predictable questions about what Burnett’s performance meant for his chances to stay in the rotation, a tired Girardi was not in the mood to entertain them. He and the team will go right from Baltimore to the West Coast and will end up playing 10 games in 11 days, in four cities, by the time the trip ends.

Part of the Yankee Stadium grounds crew, as usual, dragged the infield to “Y.M.C.A.” after the sixth inning — but the rest of the crew scurried about to spread more drying agent on the sodden infield, ruining the choreography.

Fans groaned again when, a little while later, Andino got the last out at second. The Yankee players put on jackets and ties and headed for the road. Ahead lies three weekend games in sunny Anaheim, Calif., and then three games each in Seattle and Toronto, where the ballparks have retractable roofs.

(AP Photo/Kathy Kmonicek)MoreNEW YORK (AP) — Doused for two days in the Bronx, the Yankees and Orioles headed down to Baltimore with a couple of things awaiting them.One, a good night's sleep.Two, a 60 percent chance of rain.Mark Reynolds hit a tiebreaking single in the 11th inning after striking out four times and the Orioles outlasted New York 5-4 on Wednesday in another soggy game between two sleep-deprived teams."It's been a struggle for us all year. Any win down the stretch is kind of icing on the cake for us," Reynolds said. "We're going to try to go out and win every game down the stretch and make it tough on some of these teams trying to get to the playoffs."Less than 11 hours after the Yankees completed a rain-delayed victory, the teams were back at it. The showers returned, too, though the game started on time and was never interrupted other than when the grounds crew needed to apply diamond dust to dry a soaked infield.Nolan Reimold hit a two-run homer off A.J. Burnett and the Orioles took advantage of four Yankees errors, two by fill-in shortstop Eduardo Nunez. Both teams looked sleepy and sluggish in a sloppy game — with good reason, too.With few options for a makeup date, they waited out a rain delay of 4 hours, 3 minutes on Tuesday night to play a game that ended at 2:15 a.m. Yankees players rushed home while the Orioles zipped back to their hotel to get a few precious hours of shuteye before heading back to the ballpark Wednesday morning for the 1:05 p.m. start."We don't have to worry about making up this game, and that's a good thing," New York manager Joe Girardi said. "But physically, it's been a grind. There's no doubt about it."The Yankees tried to extend this one even longer, putting runners at the corners with two outs in the bottom of the 11th.Pinch-hitter Eric Chavez, batting for Nunez, hit a low, sharp liner toward the middle and shortstop Robert Andino went to the ground to knock it down. He shoveled to second to nip Curtis Granderson for the final out, ending the game after 4 hours, 23 minutes."So many good things today," Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. "Robby came out there and played as good a game at shortstop as you'll ever see played in these conditions, too. I can't tell you how tough that is out there."Pedro Strop (1-1) worked 1 1-3 scoreless innings and Jim Johnson got three outs for his third save.The Orioles used eight pitchers, the Yankees six. The teams meet again in Baltimore on Thursday at 1:05 p.m. — weather permitting — for the makeup of an Aug. 27 rainout caused by Hurricane Irene."I think everybody's going to sleep well on the train," Showalter said.Burnett, given a reprieve in New York's six-man rotation after an effective start at Boston last week, allowed four runs in six-plus innings. Alex Rodriguez hit a two-run double and prized prospect Jesus Montero a two-run single off the right-field fence.The AL East leaders, however, had their six-game winning streak snapped. Last-place Baltimore ended a four-game slide.Burnett threw three wild pitches to raise his season total to 23, by far the most in the majors.New York matched a season high for errors, and the last one was especially costly.Nunez, starting in place of Derek Jeter, couldn't handle a hot shot with one out in the 11th, allowing Matt Angle to reach safely. Angle stole second with two outs and Nick Markakis was intentionally walked before Reynolds delivered an RBI single off Hector Noesi (2-1)."We gave them a lot of their runs today. That's the bottom line, and that's why we lost this game," Girardi said. "Even when our regulars aren't in there, our defense has been pretty good. Today it wasn't. I don't know if it was the conditions. I don't know if was fatigue. I don't know what it was, but it really cost us the game."Coming off the late night, both managers rested several regulars, and the makeshift lineups resembled a spring training game or Triple-A matchup. A trio of Yankees hitters wore numbers in the 60s, and neither team looked like a big league bunch as players battled wet, windy weather for the second day in a row.Andino's wind-blown popup in the third dropped behind the mound for a single, eluding Nunez. Burnett missed first base with his foot on a potential double play and a Bronx cheer went up when he and first baseman Brandon Laird finally converted a 3-1 putout after a couple of unsuccessful tries."Disgusting. As sloppy as it gets," Rodriguez said, referring to the Yankees' play. "You expect that with the tough conditions."With the game tied in the late innings, Granderson, Mark Teixeira, Robinson Cano, Vladimir Guerrero and Matt Wieters all came off the bench.To mark the 10-year anniversary of 9-11, the Yankees held a pregame ceremony on the field that included former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. The salute was held four days early at Yankee Stadium because the team will be in the middle of a 10-game, four-city road trip Sunday.Only a few thousand fans were in the stands when this one began — what else? — in the rain. Many had umbrellas or ponchos, others took cover on the concourse.It was the second unusually sparse crowd in a row at Yankee Stadium. Just 500 fans or so were left when Tuesday night's game finally ended.NOTES: Baltimore starter Zach Britton gave up four runs and five hits in five innings. ... Angle's bat slipped out of his hands in the second and helicoptered four rows up behind the Yankees dugout, hitting an empty seat before a fan grabbed it. ... Orioles 3B Chris Davis struck out his first five times up. When he batted again in the 11th, fans chanted "We want six!" Davis grounded out to end the inning. ... Both of Wednesday's starting pitchers left the ballpark early Tuesday night to get some rest.

(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun)MoreNEW YORK (AP) — The rain came to Yankee Stadium in droves. The fans? Not so much.About 1,000 spectators were in the stands Tuesday night when the game between the Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees started at 11:08 p.m. after a rain delay of 4 hours, 3 minutes.The crowd had dwindled to maybe 500 or so by the sixth inning when Matt Wieters hit a two-run homer for Baltimore that made it 2-all. Fans were allowed to move down to the expensive seats — there was no announcement about that over the public-address system, instead they were told individually.The Yankees also said that all tickets for this game could be redeemed for a free seat during the 2012 season.Rain kept falling throughout the evening, even after play started. Puddles formed in the infield and the grounds crew worked on the field most every inning, dumping bag after bag of diamond dust in hopes of drying out the pitcher's mound, batter's box and basepaths.During a 10-minute break in the fifth, the sound system played "Fixing a Hole" by the Beatles while the Yankees huddled under the dugout roof and Orioles manager Buck Showalter spoke to the umpires.Baltimore left fielder Matt Angle had the most glaring problem with the tough conditions. He got twisted around when Francisco Cervelli lifted a fly into the rain and swirling winds, dropped the ball for an error, slipped trying to recover and wound up with mud all over the front of his uniform.The fans had a hard time keeping their feet, too. In the fifth, two men chased a foul ball behind the plate, lost their balance on a metal walkway and splashed to the ground with a thud. They got an ovation for their effort.Several games in the majors were delayed by rain Tuesday. Major League Baseball and the Yankees talked throughout the delay on what was already shaping up as a difficult week for New York and the Orioles. The teams are scheduled to play again Wednesday at 1:05 p.m. at Yankee Stadium, then meet in Baltimore on Thursday at 1:05 p.m. for the makeup of a previous rainout.Chris Piteo of Springfield, Mass., was among the fans who waited out the delay."This is my one chance to see a game here this season," he said. "It's not like I can come any day to Yankee Stadium."With him were his sister, Marcy, and her two sons, ages 12 and 10. They were all aware that Wednesday was a school day back home."We're already discussing the options," she said with a smile.
