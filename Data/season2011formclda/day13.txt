It speaks to a team’s shaky start, a hitter’s slump, a pitcher’s struggles, with the belief — and expectation — that progress is being made. With A. J. Burnett, it seems it is always early — until it becomes too late. There is genuine enthusiasm now surrounding Burnett, whose mediocre personal statistics obscure a more valuable significance.The Yankees have won all three of Burnett’s starts, including a 7-4 victory Wednesday night against the Baltimore Orioles. After a poor showing by their starting pitchers during a weekend series in Boston, it was Burnett who restored stability, working six and a third scoreless innings before allowing a pair of two-run homers in the seventh.He now he has more victories (three) than the Red Sox.Aprils have been kind to Burnett in the past. Just last year, he was 3-0 with a 2.43 earned run average in five starts. The rest of the way, he was 7-15 with a 5.87 E.R.A., as unreliable as a lost cabbie.“I don’t really know if it is,” Burnett said, when asked whether this April is different. No one does, and the real test will not come until he gets blitzed like Orioles right-hander Chris Tillman, who was ambushed Wednesday night for six runs in one and two-thirds innings.

Stuck in an 0-for-19 rut, Jorge Posada drilled a fifth-inning homer, his fourth of the season. The 12 hits by the Yankees, including two by Derek Jeter, alleviated some of the pressure on Burnett, who overcame some early inefficiency by ushering the Yankees to a 7-0 lead through six innings.

The odds of Pedro Feliciano (strained left rotator cuff) throwing a pitch for the Yankees plummeted when Girardi revealed, somewhat cryptically, that a magnetic resonance imaging exam revealed a “damaged shoulder,” and that Feliciano would weigh options with his family, doctors and his agent before deciding on a course of treatment that could include surgery. Appearing in more games than any reliever over the last three seasons yielded a two-year, $8 million deal from the Yankees, but it also may have landed him on the disabled list for the first time in his career.As for Burnett, he unleashed a season-high 16 changeups, a pitch that he had been reluctant to throw in years past. His new catcher, Russell Martin, urged him to throw it more often, believing in its action and deception.

Credit             Barton Silverman/The New York Times           Burnett said it took him 12 years to throw the pitch with conviction, but he has grown more comfortable, deploying it nearly as often as his curveball.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Burnett waded through the first two innings on 53 pitches, and right before he faced Robert Andino to end the second, he called out the pitching coach Larry Rothschild. It was the first time, he said, that he had ever summoned a pitching coach, but he needed help. In his delivery, he was landing on his heel, and he could not correct it himself.“He was like: ‘Forget about it. Next pitch, let it go,’ ” Burnett said. “And it worked fine. He just reminded me of stuff we worked on between innings. But on the mound, it was all confidence.” [{"headline":"Sports","summary":"Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, delivered to your inbox every week.","product-code":"SP","product-title":"Sports","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/sports?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=SP&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Race\/Related Newsletter","summary":"Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with New York Times journalists.","product-code":"RR","product-title":"Race Related","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/race-related?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=RR&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Your Money","summary":"Every week, get tips on retirement, paying for college, credit cards and the right way to invest.","product-code":"MY","product-title":"Your Money","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/your-money?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=business&contentId=MY&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"}]      Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Privacy Policy    As he zipped through the middle innings, retiring eight in a row and 12 of 13, Burnett recalled the advice of a former catcher in Toronto, Gregg Zaun, who used to ride pitchers for throwing “non-competitive pitches” — N.C.P.s, as Burnett calls them. Burnett kept telling himself to bounce his curveballs, not to let them hang, which for the most part he did. At least, often enough to leave him smiling at the end of the night — and not punching clubhouse doors, as he famously did last season — despite those two late homers.“I did knock over a few cups of coffee, but that’s about it,” said Burnett, who has a 4.67 E.R.A. “Nothing hard.”INSIDE PITCHAlex Rodriguez’s three-run homer gave him 1,839 R.B.I. for his career, tying him with Ted Williams and Al Simmons for 11th place on the career list. ... The 24-year-old right-hander Hector Noesi was recalled from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to replace Luis Ayala, who went on the disabled list with an injury to a back muscle. ... With Dave Bush pitching three innings for Texas on Wednesday, the Yankees backup catcher Gustavo Molina is the only remaining player active since opening day yet to appear in a game, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. In 2007, Molina was the last player who had been on an opening day roster to get a hit.
