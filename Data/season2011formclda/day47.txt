At 19-21, they were one bullpen collapse from checking in at the .500 mark.Thanks in part to a 6-1 start, the Orioles are hanging tough in the most competitive division in American pro sports. The Orioles are in fifth place, but they trail the AL East-leading Rays by four and a half games.They have looked like they could be contenders at times, as recently as the first five and a half innings of last night’s 8-7 loss. We have seen bright spots for both the short- and long-term in the play of catcher Matt Wieters and center fielder Adam Jones and in Zach Britton’s impressive first month in the majors. And even with the injury to Brian Matusz, the rotation hasn’t been a liability like some analysts had predicted it would be. var adSkipCounter = 0; It’s been consistency that has really hurt the Orioles this year, with honorable mention going to Michael Gonzalez and the Orioles bullpen. Through 40 days and nights of baseball, the Orioles have clicked on all four cylinders on only a few occasions.On some nights -- usually the ones that open with Jeremy Guthrie on the mound -- the offense has let the starting pitching down. On others, it’s the other way around.And then there are nights like last night, when the Orioles got five scoreless innings from Chris Tillman and took a 6-0 lead into the bottom of the sixth inning, only to see the bullpen choke it away.Whatever the reason, this team has simply been streaky. The bad Orioles have had losing skids of eight, four and three games so far. The good Orioles have a four-game winning streak to their credit and have won three straight games two other times.Which of these teams will we be talking about in September?It’s too early to tell, which is why it’s understandable -- heck, it’s expected -- for worn-out fans to be waiting for the other cleat to drop. It slammed to the ground in each of the past 13 summers.But at the quarter pole, the 2011 Orioles are in the back of a crowded pack in the AL East. Their division rivals will probably pull away during the long season, but at least the Orioles are still factors in this race. We'll see how long they can hang around.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: 'thumbnails-f',     container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives',     placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives',     target_type: 'mix'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed'Blushing' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn't to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

Simon, 30, was in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, for Monday's hearing. He was back in the United States later Monday and started for Double-A Bowie on Tuesday night in Richmond, Va. Dinora Diloné, an attorney for Simon, maintains that his client is innocent in the shooting that killed Michael Castillo Almonte. "The case was sent back to trial even though there is no evidence to confirm that Alfredo was involved in the incident. Even the ballistics tests were negative," Diloné told the Associated Press. var adSkipCounter = 0;  Diloné said no date has been set for the start of the trial, "but it usually takes about two months." If he is found guilty of manslaughter, Simon faces a sentence of three months to two years in prison. The right-hander appeared in 55 games for the Orioles from 2008 to 2010, going 4-3 with a 5.64 ERA. Forty-nine of those appearances came last season, when Simon went 4-2 with a 4.93 ERA and saved 17 games in 21 chances. He has made three starts for Bowie this season, allowing seven runs (six earned) on 14 hits and five walks while striking out 17, good for a 3.38 ERA. Tuesday's outing was Simon's best for the Baysox as he pitched six scoreless innings, surrendering three hits and walking two while striking out four and throwing 53 of his 83 pitches for strikes. He was unavailable for comment after the game. Simon, is who is on baseball's restricted list, will have to be promoted to the Orioles' 25-man roster or released by Sunday or thereabouts. Should Simon be called up to the big league club, he could join the rotation or work out of a bullpen that has struggled mightily of late. Alternatively, the club could put him on its 40-man roster and attempt to send him to the minor leagues, but he would have to clear waivers. If he were to clear waivers in that scenario, he could become a free agent without any further compensation from the Orioles or maintain his current contract and accept a minor league assignment. Through an agreement among the Orioles, the players union, Major League Baseball and Simon's agent, the pitcher has begun collecting a salary of about $227,000, a prorated amount of what he made in 2010. matt.vensel@baltsun.com twitter.com/mattvensel Baltimore Sun reporters Jeff Zrebiec and Dan Connolly, The Richmond Times-Dispatch and Sun staff and news services contributed to this article.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: 'thumbnails-f',     container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives',     placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives',     target_type: 'mix'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed'Blushing' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn't to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.
