Their rock, third baseman Chipper Jones, lost a high-bouncing ball in the lights this week before Omar Infante, his former teammate who is now on the lowly Florida Marlins, hit a two-run game-winning home run off Craig Kimbrel, Atlanta’s sterling rookie reliever.Over the decades, teams falling apart during a pennant race have always made for darkly compelling viewing. Yes, watching champions spraying each other with Champagne is nice. But seeing teams — good ones, even great ones, losing night after improbable night when the games matter most — can be ghoulishly riveting.If the Red Sox and the Braves continue their descents, this September could produce two historic collapses. No team, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, has ever squandered what Boston and Atlanta are close to giving up: leads of eight or more games in the race for a spot in baseball’s postseason in the final month of the season.

But right now, I think they’re cooked.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Newspapers in Boston, at once the team’s biggest backers and bashers, are writing about the “Reeling Red Sox.” The Boston Globe dissected the recent carnage on its Web site under the banner, “Anatomy of a collapse: How did Red Sox season go off course?”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Meanwhile, many Braves and Red Sox fans have been trying to rationalize the spirals of their teams, or at least find ways not to jinx them further. Hill Peterson, who attends about a dozen home games a year, said the Braves had a few key injuries and had to rely on several rookies. Even so, he felt he might be giving the team “bad mojo,” so he will try to stay away from Turner Field for a while.

Fans thought the Red Sox had vanquished their loser label in 2004 when they won their first World Series in 86 years, in part by rallying from a three-games-to-none deficit against the hated Yankees in the American League Championship Series. For good measure, they won the World Series again in 2007.

Privacy Policy    The fall this time has been plenty fast and radically steep. The Red Sox have lost 16 of their last 21 games. On Sept. 1, the Red Sox were in first place in the A.L. East, a half game in front of the Yankees and nine games in front of the third-place Tampa Bay Rays. Boston’s lead over the Rays has dwindled to two games in the wild-card race, and the Los Angeles Angels are just three games behind.Compounding the anxiety, and fueling the fatalism, is the fact that the Red Sox, whose pitching failures have been at the heart of their struggles, must play this weekend in the Bronx against the Yankees, who clinched the division crown Wednesday and who have one of the most potent lineups in the game. Boston then travels to Baltimore to face the Orioles, who won three out of four games this week in Fenway Park, where the hometown fans booed the Red Sox off the field.Atlanta’s collapse has been every bit the equal of Boston’s, and the road ahead of the Braves is just as challenging. On Sept. 5, the Braves had an eight-and-a-half-game lead in the wild-card race over the St. Louis Cardinals and the San Francisco Giants, and seemed assured of making the playoffs for the second straight year. But their lead was down to two games over the Cardinals, who blew a four-run lead against the Mets on Thursday. Photo       Pitching problems have been at the center of Boston's struggles.

In 1964, the Phillies blew a lead of six and a half games to the Cardinals with 12 games left. The 2007 Mets were seven games atop the N.L. East with 17 games remaining, but lost the division crown on the last day of the season.

But that’s baseball. Sometimes, a lot of bad things can happen very quick.”For fans who hang on every pitch, teams losing their grip on a playoff spot seems to happen in slow motion.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)MoreBOSTON (AP) — Take that big payroll, Red Sox.For the second straight night, the last-place Baltimore Orioles rallied for a comeback win over the wild-card leading Red Sox, posting a 6-4 victory on Wednesday night.Vladimir Guerrero had a tie-breaking two-run single to lift the Orioles to their third win in the four-game series, sending Boston to its 16th loss in 21 games this month.During spring training, Baltimore manager Buck Showalter was critical in a magazine article of Red Sox GM Theo Epstein's ability to use a large payroll.On Wednesday, Baltimore's clubhouse was filled with music and happiness after beating the Red Sox again, but the players and Showalter wouldn't say that it was special to beat Boston."Just personally for us," Showalter said when asked if it meant more to do it against the Red Sox. "It doesn't matter with anybody else. I'm real proud of the guys."Tommy Hunter pitched effectively into the seventh inning and Mark Reynolds belted his 35th and 36th homers, the second tying the game at 4 in the seventh."We know the end is near and we're fighting right to the end," Orioles center fielder Adam Jones said. "I think we like to be in this situation. Everybody the last month has been working their tails off."Baltimore's strong play has affected the wild-card chase the past 10 games. The Orioles took two of three from both Tampa Bay and Los Angeles at home before coming to Boston. The Red Sox and Orioles meet for the final three games of the regular season in Camden Yards next week."This is a good baseball team. The guys are playing hard everyday," said Hunter, who also wouldn't say if it meant more to beat the Red Sox when asked. "We're playing good baseball. It's going to be fun, especially if we finish the year like this. It's going to be fun next year."Boston's wild-card lead is 2 1/2 games over both the Rays and Angels. Tampa Bay was swept in a doubleheader in New York against the Yankees on Wednesday, and Los Angeles beat Toronto, 7-2.Hunter pitched 6 2-3 innings, allowing nine hits, four runs, walking one and striking out four before leaving with a strained groin.Ace Josh Beckett took the mound, hoping to put some distance between Boston and the Rays. Beckett (13-6) allowed just one hit through five innings as the Red Sox built a 4-1 lead.But Beckett allowed a run in the sixth and two more in the seventh on Reynolds' second homer that tied the game.In the eighth, Beckett gave up a single to J.J. Hardy and a double by Nick Markakis. Alfredo Aceves relieved with runners at second and third, then gave up Guerrero's hard, two-run single to center field.One night before Boston's best starter faltered, star closer Jonathan Papelbon blew a save chance for only the second time this season when he gave up a three-run double to Robert Andino in the eighth that gave Baltimore a 7-5 win.The Boston collapse has come after it led Tampa Bay by nine games on Sept. 3.The Red Sox have six games left, all on the road — three at Yankee Stadium and three at Baltimore. Tampa Bay has seven remaining — four against the Yankees and three against Toronto.Clay Rapada (2-0) got the win and Jim Johnson earned his ninth save in 14 chances — his third in as many days against Boston. He pitched a perfect ninth and, after Jed Lowrie made the final out on a soft grounder to Johnson, the fans booed.Carl Crawford had a single, double and triple for Boston and drove in two runs.Reynolds hit a solo homer in the second before Boston tied the game in the third on a triple by Crawford and an RBI groundout by Jason Varitek.Crawford gave the Red Sox a 3-1 lead in the fourth with a two-run double after a single by Adrian Gonzalez and a double by Dustin Pedroia. Consecutive singles by Mike Aviles, Gonzalez and David Ortiz made it 4-1 in the fifth against Hunter.The Orioles added a run in the sixth when Andino singled, stole second and scored on a single by Hardy. They tied it in the seventh when Matt Wieters singled and was forced out at second on a grounder by Adam Jones before Reynolds hit his 36th homer of the season — his second of the game over the Green Monster in left field.NOTES: Reynolds tied a career high with two homers in a game.

3 View photosBoston Red Sox starting pitcher Josh Beckett delivers to the Baltimore Orioles in the first inning of a baseball game at Fenway Park in Boston, Wednesday, Sept. 21, 2011. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)MoreBOSTON (AP) — Boos poured down on the struggling Red Sox as they left the field after their latest loss. In the clubhouse, it was quiet as they packed for their final road trip — and perhaps their last games — of the year.The Red Sox road to the playoffs hit more rough spots when they blew another late lead, falling to the Baltimore Orioles 6-4 on Wednesday night, their 14th loss in 18 games.Boston's lead in the AL wild-card race increased by a half game to 2½ when the Tampa Bay Rays lost a doubleheader to the New York Yankees. But the Red Sox seemed stunned by their collapse, with blank looks on their faces and little expression in their voices."We certainly haven't made it very easy for ourselves," manager Terry Francona said. "That doesn't mean we can't get where we want to go, but we have our work cut out for us."Vladimir Guerrero hit a two-run single in the eighth inning that broke a 4-all tie. Then the Red Sox went meekly in the last two innings, failing to get a hit and ending on Jed Lowrie's soft grounder to pitcher Jim Johnson.The Red Sox led Tampa Bay by nine games on Sept. 3. Now they also must hold off the Los Angeles Angels, who also are 2½ games out in the AL wild-card race after beating Toronto 7-2 on Wednesday.The Red Sox have six games left — three at Yankee Stadium and three at Baltimore. Tampa Bay has seven remaining — four against the Yankees and three against Toronto.Can the Red Sox, who straightened out their season after losing their first six games and 10 of their first 12, do it again?"I think I can answer that better next Wednesday" after the regular-season finale, Francona said. "I'm not in a very good mood right now. We just lost a game, you know. We've lost a lot of games. We're going to have to fight for everything we get the rest of the way."Ace Josh Beckett started for Boston, hoping to put more distance between Boston and the Rays. Beckett (13-6) allowed just one hit through five innings as the Red Sox built a 4-1 lead.But he gave up a run in the sixth and two more in the seventh on Mark Reynolds' second homer that tied the game."I kept thinking when we kept it at 4-2, I thought we could get a big hit and we did," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.In the eighth, Beckett gave up a single to J.J. Hardy and a double to Nick Markakis. Alfredo Aceves relieved with runners at second and third, then gave up Guerrero's hard, two-run single to center field."You want to pitch good all year long, but especially whenever your team needs you," Beckett said. "You need to give them innings and quality innings and that was something I wasn't able to do."One night before Boston's best starter faltered, star closer Jonathan Papelbon blew a save chance for only the second time this season when he gave up a three-run double to Robert Andino in the eighth that gave Baltimore a 7-5 win.Clay Rapada (2-0) got the win on Wednesday and Johnson earned his ninth save in 14 chances — his third in as many days against Boston."It's pretty tough," Beckett said. "I wish I could have done better today. Things didn't work out. I got away with some pitches early and I didn't get away with them later on."Carl Crawford, who has struggled most of the season after signing a seven-year, $142 million contract, had a single, double and triple for Boston and drove in two runs."That'll be welcome if he wants to get real hot like he can," Francona said. "That'll really help us."Reynolds hit a solo homer in the second before Boston tied the game in the third on a triple by Crawford and an RBI groundout by Jason Varitek.Crawford gave the Red Sox a 3-1 lead in the fourth with a two-run double after a single by Adrian Gonzalez and a double by Dustin Pedroia. Consecutive singles by Mike Aviles, Gonzalez and David Ortiz made it 4-1 in the fifth against Tommy Hunter, who left the game with two outs in the seventh with a strained right groin."It got pretty tight," Hunter said. "It's one of those things that's been lingering all year. I'm glad I didn't throw another pitch."The Orioles added a run in the sixth when Andino singled, stole second and scored on a single by Hardy. They tied it in the seventh when Matt Wieters singled and was forced out at second on a grounder by Adam Jones before Reynolds hit his 36th homer of the season — his second of the game over the Green Monster in left field."It's pretty tough," Beckett said.
