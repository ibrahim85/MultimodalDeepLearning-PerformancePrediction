But Jed Lowrie hit a three-run homer in the first inning to erase an early deficit in the second game and give the Red Sox the lead for good, then Jacoby Ellsbury hit an inside-the-park homer to spark a seven-run seventh inning.

Correction: September 21, 2011   The baseball roundup on Tuesday by The Associated Press misstated, in some editions, the score after one inning of the second game of Boston’s day-night doubleheader split with Baltimore. The Red Sox led the Orioles, 4-3, not 4-2.

And if Jayson Werth got one, you can be sure Fielder will get his, too.The 27-year-old slugger is an MVP candidate in the National League this season. He is batting .296 with 33 doubles, 34 home runs and 112 runs batted in. He has hit 196 homers in the past five seasons.Obviously, that kind of production would look great on paper here in Baltimore, which in recent years has had a revolving door at first base. But it’s going take a lot of paper to convince him to sign here.I’m talking more than a hundred million in mesothelioma money. Will Peter Angelos be willing to pony it up?*** This post has been updated since its first publication.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: 'thumbnails-f',     container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives',     placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives',     target_type: 'mix'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed'Blushing' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn't to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.
