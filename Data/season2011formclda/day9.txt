I got goose bumps there.”The Rangers (7-1), who could have matched the franchise-record 7-0 start of their 1996 club, quieted the crowd in the second game, winning by 13-1 to break a brief tie with Baltimore (6-2) for the best record in the majors.

After objecting to an inside pitch from Chris Sale in the ninth, the Rays’ Felipe Lopez answered with a home run, and appeared to flip his bat in Sale’s direction. When Lopez returned, Chicago catcher A. J. Pierzynski was there to register an objection of his own, but there was no pushing or shoving.INDIANS 2, MARINERS 1 Justin Masterson took a shutout into the seventh inning, striking out nine, as visiting Cleveland won its sixth in a row.

4 It all comes down to wins and losses and the Orioles are off to a 5-1 start and are atop the AL East. I start with that because if you go by the list of players on the Orioles roster who are injured you may start to get depressed. Brian Roberts is the most recent Orioles player to succumb to sickness or injury. Yesterday, Roberts was taken to the hospital with stomach pains. There is no word yet on how serious the situation is or if Roberts is using the same hospital bed that Jeremy Guthrie used. Maybe the Orioles should just rent a hospital room for its players this season. They can put up a nice flat screen HD tv that only plays Orioles games and Baseball Tonight.Ok now a look at the injuries/illnesses that have hit the Orioles roster since the beginning of the season. I know the Orioles don’t have a lot of depth on their roster, but you tell me what major league team can get through this many losses to their roster.The Orioles projected number two and three starters Brian Matusz and Justin Duchscherer are on the disabled list. Their number one starter Jeremy Guthrie missed one start and could have his projected start on Sunday pushed back. J.J. Hardy is questionable for this weekend with tightness in his left ribcage area. Along with Roberts in the hospital the Orioles may have to play Texas without their double play combination.Guthrie, Hardy, and Roberts are all still possibilities to have to go on the disabled list in order to create room for someone to be called up. The Orioles bullpen has stayed healthy thus far, but you have a lot of fragile arms down there and Showalter needs to make sure he doesn’t overwork them too soon. Especially with a doubleheader today.I’m sure there will be some kind of roster moves made today or tomorrow depending on how Guthrie, Roberts, and Hardy feel today. Troy Patton and Chris Jakubauskas are two names who have been mentioned as possibilities to be called up to help ease the strain on the pitching staff. Depending on how serious the situations are with Hardy and Roberts will depend on if there is a move made to call up someone from the minors to replace them. The Orioles already have Izturis and Andino who can step in and start in their place for a game or two. If Hardy or Roberts has to go on the disabled list you may see Brendan Harris, Nick Green, or Ryan Adams summoned from Norfolk. However, neither of those guys are on the 40 man roster, so that may present a problem.Regardless of all the injuries that have hit the Orioles early on, there is no crying in baseball and there certainly are no excuses in baseball. Good teams find ways to win, even without their best players. If the Orioles are truly for real this will be a good test for the team. If the Orioles can manage to weather this storm of injuries than they will be in a good place to be a force in the AL East once their roster starts to get healthy. Let’s see what the Orioles are made of. 
3 View photosBaseball fans sit in the rain during a delay before the Baltimore Orioles against the Texas Rangers baseball game on Friday, April 8, 2011, in Baltimore.MoreThe Baltimore Orioles are already short-handed, and after Friday night's game against Texas was postponed by rain manager Buck Showalter also had to worry about running out relief pitchers over the weekend.The teams will play a traditional doubleheader on Saturday starting at 4:30 p.m.Shortstop J.J. Hardy (sore left rib cage) wasn't in the lineup Friday, and second baseman Brian Roberts wouldn't have played if the game went of as scheduled. Roberts experienced severe stomach pains and was taken to the hospital for tests.The pitching staff is also thin. Starters Brian Matusz and Justin Duchscherer are on the disabled list, and Showalter was concerned about taxing his bullpen in Saturday's doubleheader."You always have to think about down the road, the next day and the next day," he said. "If we play 18 innings (Saturday), that's a lot of baseball to pitch. And one of the things about being home, you know you're going to pitch nine innings."But the day off will give Hardy a chance to bounce back from his injury. He was a late scratch Thursday against Detroit and omitted from the starting lineup on Friday."I've never had anything like it," Hardy said. "But being able to throw, being able to run around not feel pain, I feel like it can't be that big a deal. So, I'm hoping to be in this series at some point."Showalter will start rookie left-hander Zach Britton in the opener and Jake Arrieta in the second game. Britton was scheduled to start on Friday night for the Orioles, who are off to a 5-1 start.Colby Lewis will start the opener for Texas and Matt Harrison will pitch in the nightcap.The Rangers had a scheduled day off on Thursday, and the rainout enabled them to remain undefeated heading into the weekend."I wish I could get excited about that," manager Ron Washington said. "I'd much rather play, but since we can't, we'll go two tomorrow."The players didn't seem to mind. Minutes after the postponement became official, Ian Kinsler and six other Rangers slid on the tarp.Texas came to town after going 6-0 on a homestand against Boston and Seattle. If the Rangers can win the opener Saturday, they will match the best start in franchise history (7-0 in 1996).A steady rainshower hit the area early in the day and never really let up. The scheduled 7:05 p.m. start was delayed for about an hour before the game was finally postponed."Everybody did everything possible to try to play," Showalter said. "It just started moving a lot slower and settling in. You're going to have periods of 10 minutes when it's not raining very hard and then it comes back again. Plus, you don't want the fans to sit in that stuff, either."
