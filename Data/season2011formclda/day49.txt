Willie Randolph, an alumnus of Tilden High in Brooklyn, belonged there. His first Beltway series, this weekend between the Baltimore Orioles and the Washington Nationals, will not feel the same.For Randolph, though, it is exactly the right place to be. His preference would be to manage again, as he did for three and a half years with the Mets. Failing that, his job as Buck Showalter’s bench coach with Baltimore is the next best thing, a learning laboratory for a baseball lifer always trying to grow.“Certain managers see things, and certain guys see everything — Buck sees everything,” Randolph said Thursday, beside the coaches’ room at Camden Yards. “But that’s good, because it teaches you how to see things.”The job returns Randolph to his coaching roots, reuniting him with Showalter, who managed the Yankees when Randolph first became a coach, in 1994. Randolph, who was fired by the Mets in June 2008, spent the last two seasons as Ken Macha’s bench coach with the Milwaukee Brewers.

Randolph has not interviewed for any other managerial openings since the Mets let him go. But, at 56, he said he would not be coaching unless he aspired to get back.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “It’s almost like a curse for a manager, because once you’ve had a taste of that — I’m not saying I can’t do what I’m doing, but it’s tougher, because you still have your own ideas, you still have your own mind-set, you still have a feel of how you would do things,” Randolph said.“You’re loyal to the people you work for, but you still itch and burn,” Randolph added. “I’ve always been a competitor, and I talk to my guys about competition and how you want to be the best. For me, you want to get back to that, because I know I’m going to be better, and I know that I’ll be able to get more out of my players than I did the first time because of the experience.”Randolph was rarely so self-reflective as the Mets’ manager, when he was reluctant to acknowledge mistakes. He is justifiably proud of his 302-253 record, and offered no specifics on what he would have done differently. Photo       Willie Randolph had a 302-253 record with the Mets.  Credit             Barton Silverman/ The New York Times           But he said he had second-guessed himself — “little regrets, not big regrets” — and had thought often about situations he could have handled better. The apprenticeship under Showalter, he believes, will be invaluable.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “There’s stuff he’ll bring up that I might have missed that I didn’t think was important, but when you think about it, it is important,” Randolph said. “All that stuff is really intriguing for me, because I’m learning something new. That’s why I keep saying growth, growth, growth, because no matter who you are — or who you think you are — in this game, everyone has room for growth if you open your mind to it.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Randolph signed for only one year; he said he wanted to evaluate his future after every season to see how he fits on a staff. He positions the Orioles’ defense, instructs the infielders and advises Showalter on in-game decisions. He also tries to impart a winning mind-set to an organization with 13 losing seasons in a row.

Privacy Policy    Showalter built playoff teams with the Yankees and the Arizona Diamondbacks, and helped the Texas Rangers improve by 18 games from his first season to his second. In Randolph, he said, he has an advocate who can speak to players bluntly and command respect.“He’s been in 11 World Series, did you know that?” Showalter said. “It’s quite a résumé. His words resonate with the players. There’s no downside to him.”The Orioles are in last place in the American League East, but they were only five games from first at the start of play on Thursday. They have held their own in the rugged division under Showalter, going 21-23 against Tampa Bay, the Yankees, Boston and Toronto since he was hired last August.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Showalter hired a new coaching staff in November, with another former manager, John Russell, as third-base coach and just one rookie coach, the former outfielder Wayne Kirby. The Orioles’ future depends largely on the development of their young pitchers, but center fielder Adam Jones, a centerpiece of the lineup, said Randolph’s attitude could only help.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “Him and Kirby, they bring that toughness to the field,” Jones said. “That mentality that it’s O.K. to not succeed? It’s not O.K., not with them. Every inning, every pitch, they want to stomp on the other team’s throat, and I’m the same way.”Randolph did some stomping with the Mets, falling one game shy of the 2006 World Series. As he tries to nurture Showalter’s Orioles, he waits for another chance.“You have to be patient in this world of sports,” Randolph said. “It’s tough, man. Everyone hopes to get a shot, and when you get your shot, you hope to sustain that. If you don’t, then you hope to get back on that wheel quick.”  A version of this article appears in print on May 20, 2011, on Page B15 of the New York edition with the headline: Randolph Wants Another Chance.

He walked off the mound at Camden Yards early Thursday as their savior, the symbol of a brilliant effort by a short-handed bullpen.Used more out of circumstance than preference in his major league debut, Noesi rescued a feeble offense by pitching three scoreless innings. When the Yankees scored three runs in the top of the 15th, en route to a 4-1 victory against the Baltimore Orioles, Noesi returned to pitch the bottom half and delivered a fourth. After retiring J. J. Hardy to end the game at 12:05 a.m. Thursday, 4 hours 56 minutes after Derek Jeter grounded Zach Britton’s first pitch up the middle, Noesi was the center of attention.Manager Joe Girardi presented him with the lineup card, a keepsake from his first career win, in his first career game. Robinson Cano, who ripped the go-ahead two-run double, came over and said, “Now, you owe me dinner.” Asked if he would follow through, the 24-year-old Noesi turned serious. “Of course,” he said.The superb relief work negated what would have been a deflating loss, after Mariano Rivera’s blown save wasted Bartolo Colon’s best start of the season, and after the Yankees stranded 14 runners, including five between the 12th and 13th innings. For a team with $20 million of bullpen help convalescing on the disabled list, the game unfolded just as the Yankees would hope. Pitching eight shutout innings, Colon, in effect, acted as his own set-up man, and handed a one-run lead to Rivera.

Credit             Greg Fiume/Getty Images           “It was a tremendous game,” Rivera said. “Only my participation wasn’t good.”His second straight blown save against the Orioles set into motion a seemingly endless supply of substitutions and missed opportunities, sparkling defensive plays and quirky moments — like A. J. Burnett’s appearance as a pinch-runner. His services were needed after Mike Gonzalez hit Chris Dickerson on the head with a pitch, drilling him with so much force that his helmet cracked. Dickerson fell in a heap, but never lost consciousness, Girardi said. He went to the University of Maryland Hospital with the head trainer Gene Monahan for a C.T. scan, and Girardi said he suspects that Dickerson has a concussion. If so, the Yankees can replace him for seven days, after baseball in March established a shorter disabled list for concussed players. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Dickerson entered in the bottom of the ninth, as a defensive replacement for Nick Swisher — or just as the bullpen battle began. For eight innings, Colon flustered the Orioles, firing strike after strike after strike, his efficiency matched only by his command. His most impressive moment was not the eighth-inning strikeout of Robert Andino, which stranded the tying run on third, but an act of self-preservation, when he speared a rocket by Hardy, then whirled to double Matt Wieters off first. Of all the adjectives one could summon to describe Colon, nimble would rank far down the list, perhaps just ahead of waifish. But Girardi has remarked that Colon, like C. C. Sabathia, is deceptively athletic and moves rather well for his size.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  At 87 pitches, Colon had the stamina to come out for the ninth. But Girardi called on Rivera because, as he said, he has Rivera. “It’s not automatic,” Girardi said, “But it is Mariano Rivera.” After Vladimir Guerrero drove in the tying run on a sacrifice fly, Girardi was left with four relievers. He vowed not to use Joba Chamberlain, who had worked the last three nights, and Dave Robertson had pitched in three of four games, usually grounds for an automatic day off. His options were Boone Logan, Luis Ayala, and two right-handers, Amaury Sanit and Noesi, who began the season with Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.Ayala pitched a scoreless 10th, and in the 11th, the Orioles loaded the bases with one out, on an intentional walk and two sharply hit infield singles, the second of which produced a game-saving play by Mark Teixeira. Alex Rodriguez dived to his left to stop a grounder by Guerrero and, with hardly a play on him, popped to his knees and decided to throw to first, anyway. “Make a play, like Brett Favre,” Rodriguez said, describing his thought process. “At that point, you’ve got to go crazy.” Photo       Alex Rodriguez, who went 4 for 7, scoring on Robinson Cano's two-run double in the 15th.  Credit             Nick Wass/Associated Press           Go crazy he did. The throw tailed wide of first base, but Teixeira ranged over and scooped it, keeping Felix Pie at third base. “It’s 100 percent skill,” Teixeira said, smiling.

After Derek Jeter grounded out with runners on second and third to end the top of the 12th, Noesi trotted in from the center-field bullpen, preparing for his first appearance since May 8. He did not even remember the last time he pitched, when asked afterward, saying only that he wanted to make good on a promise to his family in the Dominican Republic. When he was recalled for the first time, back on April 13, Noesi told them that he would strike out the first hitter. That he did, flinging a slider past J.J. Hardy, then another one past Mark Reynolds. He loaded the bases, but pitched out of the jam, and as the innings went by, he grew more and more comfortable. “It felt like nobody was on base,” Noesi said.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “Anytime a guy comes out and throws first-pitch strike, second-pitch strike and has never pitched before, that’s impressive,” Girardi said.Noesi is a starter by trade who was called up to add bullpen depth, to serve as a long reliever, as a last resort. Girardi knew Noesi could throw as many as 90 pitches, and he finished with 66, benefiting from a dose of luck when in the 15th Wieters’s one-out grounder toward the hole struck Brandon Snyder, an automatic out. On the next pitch, Hardy popped out to Eduardo Nunez, and the Yankees, after arriving at 3 a.m. from Florida, could rest easily. If all players remember their major league debuts, then Noesi is no different.But, Girardi added, “It’s one he won’t want to forget, that’s for sure.”  A version of this article appears in print on May 19, 2011, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: For Yankees, Start and Finish Make Up for What’s Between.

MoreA rough night for the Baltimore Orioles ended with a horrid 15th inning in which Mike Gonzalez hit a batter in the head, Jeremy Guthrie was thrust into a reliever's role and rookie Brandon Snyder was called out for being struck by a batted ball.It all added up to a 4-1 defeat to the New York Yankees on Wednesday."Our entire bullpen pitched well tonight," Orioles closer Kevin Gregg said. "But unfortunately, things went awry in that last inning."After allowing a two-run double to Robinson Cano in the 15th, Gonzalez struck Chris Dickerson in the head with a fastball. Gonzalez was immediately ejected, and Dickerson remained motionless on the ground for several minutes.After being helped to his feet, Dickerson — who had borrowed teammate Jorge Posada's batting helmet after his was cracked by the pitch — walked to first base before leaving the game.Dickerson was taken to a hospital for a CT scan."He was lucid and he knew where he was. He had a lump on his head," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "You have to do everything precautionary now. We're just making sure he's OK. It's standard operating procedure."Gonzalez insisted that the pitch was not thrown intentionally inside."No way, shape or form was I trying to hit Dickerson or anything like that," he said. "In fact, I was trying to throw a fastball down and away. It got away from me and I'm sorry it hit him."Alex Rodriguez had a season-high four hits for the Yankees, whose only run before the 15th was an unearned tally in the fourth.Mark Teixeira led off the 15th with a single off Jeremy Accardo (2-1). Rodriguez followed with a single, and Cano hit a liner to right-center that Adam Jones bobbled, allowing Cano to take third.Gonzalez then hit Dickerson. With Baltimore out of relief pitchers, Guthrie — the scheduled starter for Thursday — came in and gave up a sacrifice fly to Brett Gardner.New York's Hector Noesi (1-0) worked four innings in his major league debut, allowing two hits and walking three.In the bottom of the 15th, Baltimore got the first two batters on. But the uprising was short-circuited when Snyder was struck by a grounder off the bat of Matt Wieters, an automatic out."I tried to get out of the way and the ball just felt like it chased me," Snyder said.It was the longest game of the season for both teams, and the longest for the Orioles at home since a 17-inning affair against Philadelphia in 2003. The game lasted 4 hours, 56 minutes.Baltimore loaded the bases with one out in the 11th against Luis Ayala before Boone Logan struck out Luke Scott and retired Wieters on a fly ball. Wieters was a major league-best 15 for 27 with runners in scoring position before the out.Noesi worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the 12th, and the Yankees failed to score against Accardo in the 13th after getting runners at the corners with no outs."We had a lot of people pitch well. You pitch that well, you'd like to take advantage of it," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "I was real proud of our pitching tonight. It's just frustrating because we had so many opportunities there to push that run across."New York starter Bartolo Colon pitched eight innings of three-hit ball and left with a 1-0 lead, but the usually reliable Rivera gave up a run in the ninth to force extra innings. It was his third blown save in 16 tries — the second against Baltimore.Singles by Jones and Nick Markakis put runners at the corners with one out in the ninth before Vladimir Guerrero hit a sacrifice fly."We scored off Rivera there in the ninth inning and didn't do much against Colon, that's for sure," Showalter said.Colon struck out seven and walked one. The right-hander, who turns 38 next week, retired 13 straight at one point and ended his performance by striking out the side.Baltimore starter Zach Britton went seven innings, allowing an unearned run, six hits and three walks. He has gone 19 1-3 consecutive innings without yielding an earned run, lowering his ERA to 2.14.In the New York fourth, Rodriguez got a leadoff single and moved to second on a groundout. Orioles second baseman Robert Andino then failed to catch a pickoff throw from Britton, apparently the result of trying to apply the tag before securing the ball. Rodriguez took third, and Nick Swisher followed with a sacrifice fly.NOTES: The Orioles placed INF Cesar Izturis (elbow) on the 15-day DL and recalled INF Brandon Snyder from Triple-A Norfolk. ... Derek Jeter opened the game with a single, his 300th career hit against Baltimore. Jeter started as a DH for only the second time this season. ... Cano has hit in 17 straight games against the Orioles. 
6  Thanks to Dempsey's Army for re-tweeting this from Ball Hogs Radio. Today is the thirteenth anniversary of one of the craziest baseball brawls I've ever seen. As described at Ball Hogs Radio via ESPN.com's list of greatest basebrawls:  After O’s closer Armando Benitez gave up what turned out to be the  game-winning three-run homer to Bernie Williams in the eighth inning, he  took out his frustration on Tino Martinez, drilling him between the  shoulder blades. Yankee pitcher Graeme Lloyd became so incensed at the  spectacle that he raced in from the bullpen to get in a lick at Benitez.  The fight moved toward the O’s dugout, with Darryl Strawberry throwing  what the Baltimore Sun called a "sucker punch" at Benitez, swinging so  hard that he ended up in the Baltimore dugout. Then Alan Mills pounded  Strawberry, bloodying his face.  Here is 47 seconds of brawling goodness:

It's just a scary part of the game when a guy gets hit there."Gonzalez insisted that the pitch was not thrown intentionally inside."No way, shape or form was I trying to hit Dickerson or anything like that," he said. "In fact, I was trying to throw a fastball down and away. It got away from me and I'm sorry it hit him."The right-hander was surprised about being ejected from the game, but said the moment was almost surreal."It was kind of shocking. I hit him and obviously I get thrown out, and I was more worried about how he was doing down there," Gonzalez said. "First of all, I didn't understand why (he was ejected) and second of all, Dickerson is down there on the ground and that's the last thing you want to see."Alex Rodriguez had a season-high four hits for the Yankees, whose only run before the 15th was an unearned tally in the fourth.

"Both teams had a couple of opportunities that got squandered in extra innings, but we got the huge hit from Cano."New York starter Bartolo Colon pitched eight innings of three-hit ball and left with a 1-0 lead, but the usually reliable Rivera gave up a run in the ninth to force extra innings. It was his third blown save in 16 tries — the second against Baltimore.Singles by Jones and Nick Markakis put runners at the corners with one out in the ninth before Vladimir Guerrero hit a sacrifice fly."Anytime a closer blows a save, you usually don't win that game," Girardi said.Colon struck out seven and walked one.
