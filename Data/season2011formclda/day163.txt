For the first time in four days, there was nary a hint of moisture in the air, but there was also scant offense.The Yankees managed only three hits and one run, another home run by Jesus Montero, and lost, 2-1, to the Los Angeles Angels, who scored the winning run with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning as the Yankees lost their third straight game.The idea of facing Jered Weaver, the Angels’ ace, after a transcontinental journey that landed the Yankees in their third city in three days, was never going to be easy. But the Yankees would not attribute their offensive problems to fatigue or water saturation.“We’re never going to make excuses about being tired or any of that,” Mark Teixeira said. “He just pitched his butt off.” Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Weaver, who was coming off two oddly poor outings in which he allowed a combined 13 earned runs, corrected whatever flaw had ailed him and threw eight nearly flawless innings. His only blemish was a solo home run from Montero, the surging rookie sensation, who hit his third home run in the third inning.

But Yankees starter Bartolo Colon was just as good, allowing only one unearned run, thanks in part to a throwing error by Derek Jeter, over seven terrific innings just when the Yankees needed it. Their bullpen was worn out, Boone Logan, their only reliable lefty, was not available, and so Colon’s strong outing was much appreciated.“He was outstanding,” Jeter said. “What more can you ask him to do? If I didn’t throw that ball away he gets out of that and it’s a different game.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In relief, Dave Robertson pitched a perfect eighth but, with the score tied, 1-1, in the ninth, Angels third baseman Alberto Callaspo reached on an infield single off the lefty reliever Aaron Laffey and was replaced by pinch-runner Jeremy Moore.

With the lanky Weaver bearing down on him from the right side, Montero ripped a 1-2 fastball in the inside edge over the Yankees’ bullpen beyond the left-field fence, several rows up into the bleachers. It was never in doubt the moment he hit it, and it was one of only 16 home runs Weaver has given up this year in more than 2141/3 innings.“I was thinking in because, well, I’m a catcher, too,” Montero said. “So, I was thinking fastball in at that moment, and thank God I got that pitch.” [{"headline":"Sports","summary":"Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, delivered to your inbox every week.","product-code":"SP","product-title":"Sports","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/sports?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=SP&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Race\/Related Newsletter","summary":"Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with New York Times journalists.","product-code":"RR","product-title":"Race Related","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/race-related?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=RR&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Your Money","summary":"Every week, get tips on retirement, paying for college, credit cards and the right way to invest.","product-code":"MY","product-title":"Your Money","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/your-money?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=business&contentId=MY&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"}]      Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

3 Toronto Blue Jays second baseman Kelly Johnson outs Baltimore Orioles' Robert Andino (11) in a double play during the third inning of a baseball game in Toronto, Friday, Sept. 9, 2011. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Aaron Vincent Elkaim)MoreTORONTO (AP) — Brett Cecil was brilliant against AL East opponents last season. It's been a different story this year for the Blue Jays left-hander.Jeremy Guthrie pitched three-hit ball for seven innings, Vladimir Guerrero and Nick Markakis each drove in a run and the Baltimore Orioles beat Toronto 2-0, their third straight victory.The hard-luck loser was Cecil (4-9), who has not won since July 29 against Texas, a span of eight starts. Cecil allowed two runs, one earned, and seven hits in 7 2-3 innings. He walked one and struck out a season-high nine."He pitched a very good ballgame," Blue Jays manager John Farrell said. "His stuff was more crisp than his last three or four times out."Cecil went 9-2 with a 3.42 ERA in 13 starts against Toronto's division rivals last year but has slipped to 1-4 with a 4.63 ERA in seven starts against the AL East this season.While Friday's outcome wasn't what he wanted, Cecil was still encouraged by his performance."This game, I felt like my mechanics were there," he said. "I told (pitching coach Bruce Walton) after my last bullpen, I felt I was throwing like last year, staying back over the rubber as long as I could and just driving forward."Even the Orioles were impressed."He kept us off-balance," Baltimore catcher Matt Wieters said. "He had his good stuff tonight and was very deceptive."As sharp as Cecil was, he still wasn't good enough to beat Guthrie. The major league leader in losses, Guthrie (7-17) came in having won just once in his past six starts and was seeking to avoid setting a career high for defeats. The right-hander made sure of that in a stellar outing. He walked three and struck out five."He had all four pitches working," Wieters said. "He was able to keep his tempo and keep his pace all night. It seemed like he was in control throughout the whole game."Pedro Strop worked the eighth and Jim Johnson pitched around a leadoff walk to close it out in the ninth for his fourth save in eight opportunities.Baltimore opened the scoring with an unearned run in the sixth, taking advantage of a throwing error by Blue Jays second baseman Kelly Johnson. Robert Andino led off with a single but was erased at second on J.J. Hardy's fielder's choice. Johnson overthrew first base as he tried to complete the double play, allowing Hardy to move to second. One out later, Guerrero drove in Hardy with a single to left."He hit a great pitch, curveball down," Cecil said. "That's just the type of hitter he is. Seems like you can never fool him."The Orioles benefited from another missed double-play opportunity by Toronto in the eighth. With one out and runners at the corners, Nick Markakis grounded into a fielder's choice, with Hardy forced out at second. Markakis beat the relay throw from Blue Jays shortstop Yunel Escobar on a bang-bang play at first, allowing Ryan Adams to score from third. Farrell did not dispute umpire Jim Wolf's call.Cecil had to jump over the jagged end of Adam Jones' bat after the Orioles' outfielder got sawn off in the fourth inning. The barrel of the bat bounced off the mound, with Cecil kicking his legs up to avoid being struck. Jones eventually struck out.After missing two games with a sore right wrist, Adam Lind doubled to begin the second and advanced to third on Brett Lawrie's sacrifice. But Kelly Johnson struck out and J.P. Arencibia grounded out.A throwing error by first baseman Mark Reynolds and a walk to Yunel Escobar gave the Blue Jays runners at first and second with one out in the eighth, but Strop got Eric Thames to ground into a double play."That was probably the one legitimate and true opportunity we had to mount something," Farrell said.Blue Jays right-hander Kyle Drabek made his first appearance since June 12, coming out of the bullpen to work the ninth.

(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Aaron Vincent Elkaim)MoreTORONTO (AP) — Baseball has taught Jeremy Guthrie not to worry about things beyond his control, so the Orioles pitcher insists he's not concerned about an ugly win-loss mark.Record aside, Guthrie remains focused on his own performance. He had every reason to be happy Friday night.Guthrie pitched three-hit ball for seven innings, Vladimir Guerrero and Nick Markakis each drove in a run and Baltimore beat the Toronto Blue Jays 2-0, their third straight victory."You can't ever lose a game if you give up zero runs," Guthrie said. "That's the ultimate job a pitcher can do."The major league leader in losses, Guthrie (7-17) came in having won just once in his past six starts and was seeking to avoid setting a career high for defeats. The right-hander made sure of that in a stellar outing. He walked three and struck out five."It was all about Jeremy tonight," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "He was solid. He commanded the fastball. When it's there for him, he presents a lot of issues."Catcher Matt Wieters was pleased with Guthrie's effort."He had all four pitches working," Wieters said. "He was able to keep his tempo and keep his pace all night. It seemed like he was in control throughout the whole game."As much as he'd like to avoid losing 20, Guthrie said he learned years ago not to get too wrapped up with his own record."Baseball teaches you that so many things are out of your control," he said. "My first season in Baltimore was a big lesson. I felt like I had a chance to win a lot of games. To get a 'W' next to your name, a lot of things have to happen. You're dependent on four things: your execution, your defense, your offense and the bullpen. I can only control one of four, which means I have 25 percent control over getting a 'W' or an 'L' next to my name at the end of the day."Pedro Strop worked the eighth and Jim Johnson pitched around a leadoff walk to close it out in the ninth for his fourth save in eight opportunities.Baltimore opened the scoring with an unearned run in the sixth, taking advantage of a throwing error by Blue Jays second baseman Kelly Johnson.

6  So let me get this straight. The Orioles sent out a lineup that would probably get beaten in AAA (where most of the players belong) and they still managed to take a lead into the bottom of the ninth, where Kevin Gregg blew it? Yeah, that sounds about right.  At this point I think it's fair to say that no one has ever hated anyone as much as I hate Kevin Gregg. Don't you even dare try to call me out on hyperbole either, because you know you feel exactly the same way. Kevin Gregg can go suck an egg.  The beginning of this game was a back and forth affair, as neither Henderson Alvarez nor Rick VandenHurk seemed interested in holding on to a lead. The O's scored the first run of the game in the top of the first thanks to three consecutive singles from Nick Markakis, Vladimir Guerrero, and Chris Davis, but the Blue Jays went back on top in the bottom of the inning thanks to a two-run homer from Jose Bautista. Yunel Escobar, who was on base for the home run, got there via walk. Don't do that, Hurk, ok?  The Orioles JV squad tied the game in the second as Kyle Hudson bunted for a base hit, then moved to second when Alvarez threw the ball away. The next batter was Pedro Florimon, who today made his major-league debut. Florimon also bunted and just flew down the line. He was called out, but replay showed him to be safe. Way to steal Pedro's first ML hit, Derryl Cousins! At any rate, the bunt moved Hudson to third and he came in to score on a single by Matt Angle.     Friggin' Brett Lawrie hit another home run off of Orioles pitching in the second inning, putting the Jays back on top. It was the 9th home run of Lawrie's young career and 4th against the Orioles. It's gonna be a lot of fun watching that kid hit against the O's for the next several years, huh?    Alvarez wasn't happy with a lead, though, so he coughed up another run in the top of the third. With Vlad on first, Davis lined a double to center field and Vlad came all the way around to score. Josh Bell followed that with a single but Davis was thrown out at the plate to end the inning.  That was the end of the scoring until the eighth inning, although VandenHurk didn't make it out of the third. After Eric Thames flied out to left, Bautista singled and moved to second when Hudson booted the ball. That was enough for Buck Showalter, and since he has approximately 47 relievers in the bullpen, why not? Buck called on Zach Phillips, who has been great for the O's since his call up. Today was no different, as Phillips pitched 1.2 scoreless innings, allowing just one walk.     In fact, the entire bullpen minus one douchey closer was fantastic today. Phillips was followed by Chris Jakubauskas, Troy Patton, Willie Eyre, and Clay Rapada, and the five pitchers combined for a line of 6 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 4 K. Gregg didn't enter the game until there was one out in the ninth, after Rapada struck out David Cooper.  But back to the offense. After the third inning Alvarez calmed down and ultimately pitched seven innings. He didn't allow another run, and in fact only two batters reached base against him after the third inning, one of whom was wiped out on a double play. So the teams entered the eighth inning tied 3-3 as the Blue Jays' bullpen finally entered the game.  Jesse Litsch relieved Alvarez and immediately gave up a double to Robert Andino. Nick Markakis grounded out, but Vlad also doubled to easily score Andino. Success! Sadly Vlad was stranded as both Davis and Bell struck out, but the O's had their first lead since the top of the first inning and only needed six more outs to lock up the game and get their first series win against the Jays this year.  Unfortunately, they only got five of those six outs. After Patton, Eyre, and Rapada combined for a perfect eighth inning and then Rapada retired the first batter of the ninth, the Orioles brought in Kevin Gregg. Gregg needed to get just two outs before allowing two runs, and he got the first immediately by striking out Lawrie. As for the rest, well, it was vintage Kevin Gregg. I've done this before, but I just can't stand to write about him. So here is the play-by-play from MLB.com:    Pitcher Change: Kevin Gregg replaces Clay Rapada.  2.Brett Lawrie strikes out swinging.  3.Kelly Johnson walks.  4.Jose Molina singles on a ground ball to left fielder Kyle Hudson. Kelly Johnson to 2nd. Offensive Substitution: Pinch runner Chris Woodward replaces Jose Molina. Offensive Substitution: Pinch hitter Adam Loewen replaces Dewayne Wise.  5.Adam Loewen hit by pitch. Kelly Johnson to 3rd. Chris Woodward to 2nd. Offensive Substitution: Pinch hitter J. Arencibia replaces Mike McCoy. With J. P. Arencibia batting, wild pitch by Kevin Gregg, Kelly Johnson scores. Chris Woodward to 3rd. Adam Loewen to 2nd.  6.J. P. Arencibia singles on a line drive to left fielder Kyle Hudson. Chris Woodward scores. Adam Loewen to 3rd.    Hate. I haven't seen any post-game comments from Gregg, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if the blamed the entire thing on Craig Tatum.

But he's not acting like facing his old club is routine. "I came up with the Orioles. I still watch a lot of their games because I am pretty much a fan of the Orioles. I was drafted by them, I know all the guys. I know the awesome people in the organization that are running it now," Loewen, the fourth overall pick in the 2002 draft who never realized his pitching potential because of injuries, said Friday. "As much as I wanted to be a Baltimore Oriole, I thought this would be the best situation for me. But, really, it will be emotional. Because as much as I want to be on the other side, I think this is the right spot for me. But I was torn between the two." var adSkipCounter = 0;  Loewen, 27, was recalled this week from Triple-A Las Vegas, where he hit .306 with 17 homers, 85 RBIs and a .377 on-base percentage in 134 games. He played right field Wednesday, going 1-for-3 and collecting his first major league hit (he was 0-for-2 in interleague plate appearances with the Orioles). He didn't start in Friday's series opener but pinch-hit in the ninth inning of Saturday's game, getting hit by a pitch from Orioles closer Kevin Gregg to load the bases on the way to the Blue Jays' 5-4 win. "I wouldn't have [attempted the transition] if I didn't think I could, but now that I am here, I am kind of amazed at what has gone on," said Loewen, the first player since Rick Ankiel to make it to the big leagues in separate stints as a pitcher and hitter. "But it definitely is not over yet. It's just the beginning. This is definitely an achievement, but I want to do more than play just a couple games." A native of British Columbia, Loewen ruffled some feathers in October 2008, when he decided to sign with Toronto instead of attempting his comeback as an outfielder with an Orioles club that signed him to a $4 million package as an amateur. Orioles management thought it had a handshake agreement with Loewen when he was released from the 40-man roster. "I did feel bad about it, but, at the same time, how many guys do professional organizations release every day that they say, 'Oh, you are going to be the guy for us?' You can look at it that way," he said. "But at the end of the day, I really had to do what was best for me and what I thought I could succeed the best at." After getting phone calls from Blue Jays icon Cito Gaston and then-assistant general manager Alex Anthopoulos and receiving a two-year commitment, Loewen signed with the only big league organization in his native country. "Truthfully, that kind of blew me away," he said. "Wow, the [Jays'] organization really wants me, and they are going to give me a shot." In 2004, Loewen was Baseball America's 13th best prospect overall, and the Orioles were salivating over the left-hander's 6-foot-6 frame and impressive repertoire. But elbow injuries — specifically stress fractures a year apart — made it difficult for him to stay on the field and, finally, to pitch at all. "You just felt sorry for him. It's one of those things you can't do anything about," said Orioles right fielder Nick Markakis, one of Loewen's best friends on the Orioles. "He had one other option, and he took that route. And to get back up here to the big leagues the way he has done, it is pretty unbelievable." As an Oriole, Loewen was 8-8 with a 5.38 ERA in 35 games (29 starts) over parts of three seasons. He struck out 134 batters and walked 106 while allowing 163 hits in 164 innings. He said he's not sure what to expect if he returns to Baltimore as a Blue Jay, but he played for New Hampshire at Double-A Bowie last year and was treated well by the fans in Maryland. "They were great. Nobody heckled me; there were a couple cheers. I was really excited about that. I thought I was going to get booed," he said. "I went out early to make sure I signed autographs for everybody. "That was kind of my apology to them," he joked. dan.connolly@baltsun.com twitter.com/danconnollysun Orioles Insider | Live scores | Photos | Baseball app     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: 'thumbnails-f',     container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives',     placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives',     target_type: 'mix'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed'Blushing' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn't to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.
