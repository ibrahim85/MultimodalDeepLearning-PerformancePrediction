The Yankees’ starters for the coming series do not generate great confidence, and the bullpen is down to six relievers.“It’s an opportunity for someone to step up big,” Manager Joe Girardi said.No one stepped up bigger Monday than Garcia, who issued a statement performance to help wipe away some of the soggy residue from the beginning of the long weekend. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The Yankees spent four days here, waited out Hurricane Irene in their hotel rooms, and sniped with the Orioles about the rescheduling due to the storm. They lost the first two games and two important players before splitting the series against a team that is the worst in the American League.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Now, it becomes more interesting in Boston.“Two great teams,” said Nick Swisher, who goes into Boston on a tear. “This series is big for us.”Swisher hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning Monday for his sixth homer in his last seven games. In the first inning, Mark Teixeira knocked in Curtis Granderson with a double to become the only player to record 100 runs batted in and 30 home runs in each of the last eight seasons.Granderson, Teixeira, Swisher and Robinson Cano, who singled and scored on Swisher’s home run, have all been vital as the Yankees have pushed on for a large chunk of the season without Rodriguez. And they will probably have to continue doing so for at least a short while.

After reinjuring his left thumb in the first game of Sunday’s doubleheader, he went back to New York on Monday to have it examined.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Perhaps of even greater concern to the Yankees is the lineup of pitchers they have scheduled for Boston, and that includes the ace C. C. Sabathia, who will pitch the opener Tuesday. Normally, Sabathia is among the most dependable pitchers in baseball. But in four starts against the Red Sox this year, he is 0-4 with a 7.21 earned run average.On Wednesday, it will be Phil Hughes, who was battered in his last outing, and on Thursday the struggling A. J. Burnett gets perhaps his last chance to remain in the rotation.After the way Garcia threw Monday, he might have been the best option. Pitching for the first time in 22 days, Garcia dominated the Orioles with a full array of pitches, including the split-finger fastball that he had not been able to throw after he cut his right index finger early this month.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Garcia held the Orioles to one run, on a Mark Reynolds home run, and two hits in six sterling innings, making an airtight case that he should not be removed from the rotation again. Garcia is 7-2 over his last 11 starts, with a 2.41 E.R.A., and after Monday’s performance, Girardi said Garcia would take his next turn in the rotation.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “That was as good as it gets,” Girardi said.After allowing a double in the first, Garcia he set down the next 11 Orioles, three by strikeout. With one out in the fifth, he hung a slider to Reynolds, who powered it into the left-field seats for the Orioles’ first run and Garcia’s only blemish.“No problem today,” Garcia said. “Everything was working.”Rafael Soriano pitched a scoreless seventh, but in the eighth, Dave Robertson allowed his first home run of the season, a solo shot by J. J. Hardy. Robertson got through that inning, and Mariano Rivera closed it in the ninth for his 34th save.And with that, the Yankees finally left town after four days, headed for Boston, where a real divisional test awaited them.

The Orioles won 2-0. (AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) — New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter was scratched from the starting lineup for Sunday night's game against the Orioles after bruising his right knee in the opener of the split doubleheader.The injury could keep him out of Monday's game, too.Jeter played in his 2,402nd game with New York on Sunday afternoon, breaking a tie with Mickey Mantle for most in a Yankees uniform. He fouled a ball off his knee in the third inning of New York's 2-0 loss and remained in the game, but acknowledged afterward that "it hurt."After the first game, Jeter insisted he would play in the nightcap. He was in the original starting lineup, but was removed shortly before the first pitch and replaced at shortstop by Eduardo Nunez."We iced it between games and afterward, and it swelled up and became a challenge," Jeter said after the second game."You guys asked me, and when I told you I was fine, I really was fine. It was really bizarre to be honest with you. After we iced it, it swelled up."Yankees manager Joe Girardi said Jeter probably would not be available for the finale of the four-game series Monday night."He came in after the game and he iced and then he got really, really sore to the point they x-rayed it," Girardi said. "The x-rays came back negative. After the game, maybe the adrenaline is gone, he got really sore. He's day-to-day. I don't think we'll have him (Monday)."Jeter wasn't so sure."We'll see what happens," he said. "I'm hopeful to play whenever."Jeter had difficulty explaining why his right knee suddenly became bothersome."It's a bizarre circumstance because I was ready to play," he said. "I finished the (first) game, it felt like I had been hit like I have been hit a lot of times. Then it just blew up between games."

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) — Even without Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez in the lineup, the New York Yankees still pack a wallop.Curtis Granderson hit two of New York's five home runs, rookie Ivan Nova won his 10th straight decision, and the Yankees beat the Baltimore Orioles 8-3 Sunday night for a split of a day-night doubleheader.Granderson hit a three-run drive in the third inning and a solo shot in the seventh to take over the major league lead in homers (38) and RBIs (107)."It's incredible what he's done this year," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "There's a lot of talk about MVP, and that will all be settled later. He's been unbelievable for us."In the first game, rookie Zach Britton allowed four hits over seven innings to lead the Orioles to a 2-0 victory. It was Jeter's 2,402nd game with New York, breaking a tie with Mickey Mantle for most in a Yankees uniform.But Jeter fouled a ball off his right knee in the third inning, and although he shook off the pain to finish the game, the Yankees captain was a late scratch in the nightcap with a bruised knee."We iced it between games and afterward, and it swelled up and became a challenge," Jeter said after the second game.X-rays were negative, but Girardi expressed doubt about Jeter's availability Monday night for the finale of the four-game series.Rodriguez also watched Game 2 from the dugout with a sore left thumb."We just felt it wasn't in our best interest in playing him, either," Girardi said.The second game was tied at 3 before New York hit three straight homers in a four-run sixth. After Robinson Cano connected with a man on, Nick Swisher and Andruw Jones also went deep. It was the first time the Yankees hit three successive homers since May 20, 2009, against Baltimore.Despite the power surge, Girardi hates the idea of being without Jeter and Rodriguez."We need to get them healthy," he said. "It is somewhat of a concern."Nova (14-4) gave up three runs and seven hits in seven-plus innings, striking out seven and walking two. The right-hander has won seven straight starts and is 10-0 in 11 outings since June 3.Brian Matusz (1-7) allowed six runs and six hits — including three home runs — in 5 1-3 innings. Adam Jones had two RBIs for the Orioles, whose six-game winning streak ended.Baltimore led 2-0 before Granderson hit his first homer. He has 11 career two-homer games, including four this season.Granderson still doesn't consider himself to be a slugger."It's one of those freak things," he said. "I was thinking about the home run guys, those that can do it, they hit mammoth shots. Mine, as long as they get over the fence, that's great."In the first game, Britton allowed four singles, struck out five and walked one before being pulled after throwing a career-high 120 pitches. It was a vivid contrast from his previous start against the Yankees, when he yielded nine runs and got only one out in a 17-3 loss July 30."I wasn't thinking about getting revenge or anything," Britton said. "You have to have a short memory."Britton (8-9) has given up only one run over 12 innings since coming off the disabled list (strained left shoulder) on Aug. 22. Before going on the DL, he surrendered 23 runs in three starts."Not only was it like a break for me physically, but mentally, too," Britton said of his time off.The game was scoreless until the seventh, when Nick Markakis doubled and Vladimir Guerrero singled. Baltimore added a run in the eighth when Mark Reynolds led off with his third hit and scored on a two-out single by J.J. Hardy.Jim Johnson pitched a perfect eighth and Kevin Gregg worked the ninth for his 19th save, getting Rodriguez to hit into a double play after giving up a one-out single to Mark Teixeira, who had three hits.Cano went 0 for 3, ending his 17-game hitting streak. He had also hit in 18 consecutive games at Camden Yards.The Yankees failed to get a runner past first base in their first shutout loss since June 13.Bartolo Colon (8-9) gave up two runs and seven hits in 7 2-3 innings. He had a two-hitter through six innings before faltering. He has lost his last three starts and is 2-6 in his last eight decisions.But he considered this effort to be a breakthrough."I feel very happy. Thank God that everything is back together," he said through a translator. "We'll see how far we're going to go."NOTES: The nightcap was rescheduled from Saturday's doubleheader rainout. The other game will be made up on Sept. 8 at 1:05 p.m. ... Britton's 120 pitches were most by an Oriole this season. ... New York intends to activate RHP Freddy Garcia (cut index finger) from the DL to start in Monday's series finale. Alfredo Simon (4-6) will pitch for the Orioles.
