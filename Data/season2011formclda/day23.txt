And definitely, they remembered how to hit. Their 15-3 thrashing of the Baltimore Orioles evolved from a mismatch into a rout in a seven-run eighth inning, when they hit three of their five home runs to send Yankee Stadium, err, Camden Yards into hysterics. The legions of Yankees fans that invaded Baltimore for the weekend witnessed a complete performance — eight stellar innings from C. C. Sabathia, a season-high 14 hits, Alex Rodriguez’s 22nd career grand slam — that reached its climax in the top of the ninth, when the Orioles right-hander Josh Rupe made sure Russell Martin did not homer for a third straight at-bat by drilling him between the shoulder blades with a 91-mile-per-hour fastball.The Yankees perceived the pitch as retaliatory. “There’s no doubt about it,” said Martin, who added, “I wouldn’t recommend him doing that again.” The Orioles, acknowledging what Brett Gardner called “quite a coincidence,” said there was no intent, and Rupe suggested that he would try to apologize to Martin on Sunday.

For me, did I want to send a message? No, I’m not that type of guy.” Photo       Alex Rodriguez's grand slam was one of five Yankees homers.   Credit             Joe Giza/Reuters           Four pitches later, Gardner crushed a two-run homer, and Martin glared at Rupe as he touched the plate.“I’ll just say it was beautiful,” Girardi said.And as the weather went, it was: 74 degrees and clear at first pitch, a turn that clearly delighted Sabathia, perhaps the only person in the visiting clubhouse cheering when Friday’s game was postponed by rain. Sabathia said he slept all day Saturday, trying to recover from flulike symptoms, and then went out and pitched eight innings, the most by a Yankees starter this season, in extending his mastery over the Orioles. He threw 103 pitches, 47 in his last two innings.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “That’s as good as he’s been,” Girardi said of Sabathia, who improved to 15-2 with a 2.89 earned run average in 21 career starts against the Orioles. He added, “He had the low pitch count, and that’s what we’re used to seeing from C. C.” [{"headline":"Sports","summary":"Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, delivered to your inbox every week.","product-code":"SP","product-title":"Sports","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/sports?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=SP&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Race\/Related Newsletter","summary":"Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with New York Times journalists.","product-code":"RR","product-title":"Race Related","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/race-related?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=RR&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Your Money","summary":"Every week, get tips on retirement, paying for college, credit cards and the right way to invest.","product-code":"MY","product-title":"Your Money","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/your-money?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=business&contentId=MY&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"}]      Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Privacy Policy    Armed with solid control of his slider and two-seam fastball, Sabathia retired his first 11 hitters, and 17 of his first 18, to give the Yankees’ relievers a break that was appreciated, if, after the two days off, not entirely needed. Heading into Saturday, the Yankees’ rotation had thrown the fewest innings (851/3 ) in baseball, leaving the bullpen to collect, on average, the final 11 outs. On Saturday, it recorded only three, by the newcomer Buddy Carlyle, who must have enjoyed pitching with a 12-run lead.

He singled again in the sixth, when he scored on Martin’s first home run, and in the eighth, when he came home on one by Jorge Posada.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Since 2009, Cano is hitting .526 (41 for 78) at Camden Yards. And over his career, he has the second-highest average, .381 (77 for 202), among players with at least 120 plate appearances at the ballpark, according to Stats LLC. Only Ichiro Suzuki of Seattle (.388) surpassed him, and Cano joked that he hoped to overtake Suzuki by Sunday night.At this rate, Martin could eventually join him. With six homers in 54 at-bats, he has exceeded his total (five in 331 at-bats) with Los Angeles last season, evidence that he has overcome the knee and hip problems that threatened to derail his career. An off-season spent strengthening his body through mixed martial arts workouts instilled confidence and, perhaps, a clear state of mind. He credited tai chi with helping him harness his emotions after being plunked by Rupe.“I’m glad it didn’t hit me in the head,” Martin said. “If it hit me in the head, there would have been different consequences, I’m sure.”INSIDE PITCHAfter showing improved arm strength in a throwing session Saturday, Phil Hughes is tentatively scheduled to make a minor league start Thursday. After a round of long-toss, a 45-pitch warm-up and three simulated innings of 15 pitches each, Hughes felt fatigued, but in a good way, he said. “I still felt like my arm had some juice in it,” Hughes said. ...

The game itself, though, was basically over after 10 pitches. Paced by another gem from ace CC Sabathia, the Yankees embarrassed the Orioles 15-3 on Saturday night in front of an announced crowd of 39,054, the majority of which was wearing pinstripes and chanting, "Let's Go Yankees." "It's really tough to swallow," said Orioles starter Brad Bergesen (0-3), who allowed six runs in six innings. "To get beat by 12 runs tonight, with that many Yankee fans, it's not fun whatsoever." var adSkipCounter = 0;  The outcome, though, has become the norm when these two American League East teams face off. The first-place Yankees (11-6) are now 40-17 against the Orioles since the start of 2008, and have won 27 of the last 34 match-ups. Making things worse, the Orioles (8-11) lost again to Sabathia, who entered battling flu-like symptoms and exited with his ninth win in 10 decisions at Camden Yards. He is 15-2 versus the Orioles in his career. The big lefty's .900 winning percentage at Camden Yards is the best for anyone who has started at least 10 times in the park's 20 seasons and his .882 winning percentage is tops against the Orioles in their modern-day history (minimum 20 starts). "He was good tonight. He's good a lot of nights, but that's probably the best I've seen all three of his pitches working at the same time," said Orioles catcher Matt Wieters. "His breaking ball, his changeup, he had his fastball working. He was just sitting on the outside corner and he's tough to beat when you do that. He's also tough to beat if you give him 15 runs." Sabathia (1-1) made the Orioles' bats look sickly, retiring the first 11 in order before Derrek Lee's single with two outs in the fourth. Sabathia's only real mistake came in the seventh, when Orioles center fielder Adam Jones hit a three-run homer, his team-leading fourth of the season. Otherwise, Sabathia cruised, allowing six hits, one walk and striking out seven for his first win of the season. He was staked to a 3-0 lead before the Yankees saw their 11th pitch. In the first two minutes of Saturday's thrashing, the Yankees scored three runs on four hits against Bergesen. The right-hander eventually settled, setting down 14 of 17 until the Yankees' three-run sixth, when catcher Russell Martin hit his first of two homers. "It's a great hitting lineup, and like I said, (on) a couple pitches they really made it hurt tonight," said Bergesen, whose ERA is now 5.40. "This lineup, you're not going to get away with a whole lot and it was evident tonight." Bergesen wasn't the only Orioles pitcher victimized: Jason Berken allowed a two-run homer to Jorge Posada and a solo shot to Martin in a seven-run eighth that was capped by the 22nd career grand slam by Alex Rodriguez against reliever Josh Rupe. Rodriguez moved into second all-time in career grand slams while guaranteeing the Yankees the home-run cycle (solo, two-run, three-run and grand slam). It also gave Rodriguez six RBIs, placing him 10th all-time on the RBIs list with 1,847. Rupe served up another home run in the ninth, a two-run shot to Brett Gardner. It occurred right after Rupe plunked Martin in the back — between his shoulder blades. Given Martin's night, it looked like a purpose pitch. "Yes. There's no doubt about it," said Martin, who stared down Rupe but went to first base without incident. "I want to stay in the lineup so I'm not going to do anything stupid, but I wouldn't recommend him doing that again." Afterward, Rupe denied throwing at Martin intentionally. "I've already given up a home run (to Rodriguez) and, yeah, I was really pissed off," Rupe said. "But I'm not going to resort to possibly hurting a guy, and end his career or anything like that. There's no reason for me to do that. I'm not that type of guy." Said Orioles manager Buck Showalter: "It did not look good. I didn't like it at all. But I choose to believe my pitcher and I've known Josh for a long time. I think he'd be very straight with me. But I do understand what it looked like and it didn't look good." It wasn't the only the moment of tension between the teams. In the first inning, with Derek Jeter on first, Anne Arundel County native Mark Teixeira slammed a ball off the out-of-town scoreboard in right. Right fielder Nick Markakis barehanded the ball and threw to shortstop Robert Andino as Teixeira slid hard into the second-base bag. As Teixeira bounced up, he and Andino tangled momentarily and then jawed at each other. Second base umpire Marvin Hudson got between the two to make sure the situation didn't escalate. "He came in and slid and when he came up, he came up with a little shoulder (push) and I just told him, 'Hey, Relax. I'm just putting a tag on you.' That's it," Andino said. "We talked when I got to first base (in the sixth). Everything is cool." Teixeira also dismissed the moment as, "not a big deal at all." Ultimately, the Yankees got the last laugh, dropping the Orioles into last place for the first time this season while scoring their most runs in one game in roughly a season and a half. "I'm glad they don't carry over," Showalter said. "I'm glad in a way that we've got a day game (Sunday). We'll have a challenge tomorrow and we'll see if we're up to it." dan.connolly@baltsun.com twitter.com/danconnollysun      window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: 'thumbnails-f',     container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives',     placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives',     target_type: 'mix'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed'Blushing' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn't to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

At the Charm City Heroes event, where dozens of Baltimore sports stars were signing memorabilia Saturday, Robinson was in good spirits. He greeted some of the same fans who sent him hundreds of get- well cards and letters of support while he was hospitalized for an infection at Greater Baltimore Medical Center. Friday was "the first time I've been out since I got home from the hospital a little over a week ago," Robinson said. "I'm getting stronger every day." var adSkipCounter = 0;  The day before he was supposed to undergo routine surgery in March, Robinson developed a fever and infection and was taken to GBMC, according to a statement he released shortly after being admitted. Robinson was also treated for prostate cancer in 2009, and announced that he remains cancer-free. Terri Hett, 52, received a peck on the cheek from the legendary third baseman before walking away with Robinson's signature on a bright-red baseball bat. Robinson's career spanned her childhood: She began watching him play for the Orioles when she was 4 years old, and Robinson's retirement in 1977 coincided with the year she graduated from high school. "He was my childhood hero. Brooks was my guy, growing up as a kid with my dad," said Hett, who sent Robinson a letter of support when he was in the hospital. "You kind of take those moments for granted, and things change." Greg Rogers, 53, got the chance to introduce Robinson to his son — whom he named after the Orioles player. Brooks Rogers, 18, said he played baseball growing up, also as a third baseman. "He was my hero growing up as a kid, so I named [my son] after my hero," said Greg Rogers, of Glenwood. "He was the best at his position and a great hitter and a wonderful person." The father and son even had a custom No. 5 jersey made with "Brooks" on the back instead of the standard "B. Robinson," which Robinson signed for them Saturday. Many players of Robinson's era stayed with the same team for their entire careers, which made fans more devoted to them, Greg Rogers said. Growing up in Maryland, he said, he watched Robinson "all through my lifetime." Robinson played 23 seasons for the Orioles. "His era was huge. We're still following his career," said Rogers, who works for the Howard County Board of Education. "Now, players move so often, it's hard to follow them." Jason Campbell, 31, is too young to have watched Robinson play. But he, too, learned to love Robinson through his father, and said the very first baseball he owned was signed by Robinson. "He's Mr. Oriole," said Campbell, who works in retail and lives in Hagerstown. "He was the face of the franchise until Cal [Ripken Jr.] came." Robinson's daughter, Diana Farley, and his young grandson, Grant, stood behind Robinson as he signed autographs. Grant also plays baseball as a third baseman and said he got a kick out of all the fans lining up to see his grandfather, known as "Poppy" in the family. "Everybody loves him so much," Diana Farley said. "We're just glad he's out of the hospital." jtorbati@baltsun.com twitter.com/jtorbati     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: 'thumbnails-f',     container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives',     placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives',     target_type: 'mix'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed'Blushing' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn't to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.
