When the Phillies acquired their fourth star pitcher in December, the word went forth that they should never lose a game this year, should go 162-0. But that was just a way of putting them on the spot, letting them know the whole baseball world was watching.The Phillies are now 4-1 after hammering the Mets, 10-7, on Wednesday night as the Mets’ ace-by-default, Mike Pelfrey, and the Phillies’ fifth starter, Joe Blanton, were both knocked out of the game early. Anybody who knows anything about this daily and leavening sport knew that lurking early in April was just such a game as Tuesday night’s. Cole Hamels, who would be an ace for some teams we could mention, could not get out of the third inning in a 7-1 loss to the Mets, after the Phillies had won their first three games.Hamels could not get a grip on the ball or on himself, giving up six hits and six runs in that brutal inning and leaving to yowls of anguish from the sellout crowd of 45,365. The Phillies have some injuries and resultant holes in their lineup, but the locals seemed to believe the propaganda that the Phillies should never lose a game this season, and they were not happy.This is what happens when the fervent people of Philadelphia are handed high expectations by General Manager Ruben Amaro Jr., who reacquired Cliff Lee in December to go along with Hamels and Roy Halladay and Roy Oswalt. These audacious and expensive moves gave baseball fans cause to imagine the best pitching staff of this time, perhaps matching great staffs of other ages.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Collins praised Hamels, saying, “He’s a good pitcher,” then added: “So’s the guy tomorrow. He’d be two or three on some staffs.” He was talking about Blanton, who would be blasted out in the fifth inning Wednesday night. Handed a 7-0 lead after three innings, Blanton gave it all back in the next two innings and finished with no decision.Everybody agrees the Phillies are loaded. Their staff reminds baseball people of some great staffs they have seen, or studied in a record book. Collins compared this staff to the Atlanta Braves’ staff of Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Steve Avery in the mid-’90s. The first three went on to produce careers worthy of Hall of Fame consideration, but Avery was hurt early. “When he was healthy, he was the best of them,” Collins said.Other people are reminded of the Baltimore Orioles in 1971, when Dave McNally won 21 games and Jim Palmer, Pat Dobson and Mike Cuellar each won 20, the second staff in baseball to accomplish that. For all that, the Orioles won the pennant but lost the World Series to Pittsburgh in seven games.

In 1920, Red Faber won 23, Dickie Kerr won 21, and the two disgraced pitchers, Lefty Williams and Eddie Cicotte, won 22 and 21, and never pitched again.

In those rudimentary times, the Orioles and their fans and even the news media — such as it was — did not gush about instant legends as easily as we do today, possibly because the salaries did not inspire exaggeration or comparison.

The Orioles did not have much time to get giddy over their collective grandness, not with Manager Earl Weaver pecking away at them.“I don’t think we ever thought of each other as 1-2-3-4,” Palmer said, adding that the pitchers did try to outdo each other.

Privacy Policy    The first three pitchers in the Phillies’ rotation are far too dour to indulge in much discussion about their collective talent. Hamels, 27, is a little more comfortable with public discourse. He stood around long after his sloppy outing Tuesday night and admitted he was pretty bad.His performance was the opposite of his three teammates, who in the first three games walked one batter in their first 19 innings (the slacker was Oswalt). Throwing strikes was just the way to start the season, Manuel said.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “You don’t need a lot of time,” Manuel said, “meaning the game moves right along.

It’s a game of momentum.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Both managers talked about the competitiveness of major leaguers. Collins, who managed the Angels in 1997, 1998 and 1999, recalled how “we couldn’t wait to face Clemens.” He said, “He still struck out 16, but we loved to hit against him.”And Manuel, a marginal major league hitter, said he enjoyed hitting against the best pitchers, although he could not remember terrorizing any superstars. It was just the challenge of it.A few hours before game time, while he was still undefeated, Manuel praised the Mets, who have become back benchers in this division because of the rise of the Phillies.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  He praised their pitchers and their hitters, particularly David Wright, who then went out and got four hits against Hamels. Manuel knew there would be nights like this. Given the talent, it is his job to make sure there won’t be many of them.

6  Tonight's game was just a little different from the first four games the Orioles played this year. Starting pitcher Brad Bergesen was very ineffective, lasting just 3.2 innings while Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander shut the Orioles down on four  hits through eight innings. The end result was the O's first loss of the year, giving them a 4-1 record. I guess that means they'll only have 129 wins this year. I guess I can live with that. Let's get the ugliness out of the way first, shall we? Brad Bergesen, making a spot start for the ill Jeremy Guthrie, did not have his best day. While his velocity looked pretty good he just could not locate his pitches. A ground ball artist on his good days, Bergy couldn't keep his pitches down (or in the strike zone). He only walked two batters, but went to a three-ball count on six of the eighteen batters he faced. In his 3.2 innings he threw 89 pitches and induced just one ground ball. It was just a poor showing for Bergy. It was obvious from the get-go that Bergesen didn't have his pitches working for him. After retiring Austin Jackson to start things off, he walked Will Rhymes (best Will name this side of Will Startup), which brought Magglio Ordonez to the plate. Ordonez hit a bullet but luckily it was an easy catch for Adam Jones in centerfield. Will Rhymes helped the O's out by completely misreading the ball and taking off for second. Jones was able to double him up easily.      Bergesen wouldn't get so lucky in the second inning as shoddy defense combined with his poor pitching spelled disaster. He got the first two outs (retiring Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez) but things went downhill from there. Brennan Boesch hit a pop-up to shallow right field that should have been caught for the final out of the inning, but as Brian Roberts ranged out and Nick Markakis ran in there was a bit of confusion and the ball deflected off of Brian's glove. He was charged with the error but Nick really needed to take charge of that ball. This is the second time in the young season that Nick has been tentative in calling off an infielder as nearly the same thing happened last Sunday in Tampa Bay. Get it together, Nicky! So instead of getting out of the inning, Bergesen had to face Jhonny (sp) Peralta, who he walked, then catcher Alex Avila hit a ball high off of the scoreboard in right field. He just missed the HR but did clear the bases, giving Bergesen two unearned runs in the inning. Bergy escaped the third inning with just a single, although Miguel Cabrera killed a ball with two outs that happened to go right to J.J. Hardy at shortstop. Sadly, Bergy would not survive the fourth inning, allowing two more runs and getting just two outs. With two outs and Victor Martinez on base, Alex Avila came to bat. Ok, I think I need to tell you all something. You know, just to get it off my chest. Before the game started I said to the person sitting next to me in the press box that despite the fact that Victor Martinez isn't a great catcher by any means, it might be worth the trade-off to have his bat at that position instead of Alex Avila. This, of course, came back to haunt me and after this particular at-bat by Avila I got told by said press box person that I'm a jinx. So, sorry about that guys. Back to Avila. On a 2-2 pitch, he launched a ball to right field. It was absolutely a two-run HR, no doubt about it. That made the score 4-0 in favor of the Tigers and after Brandon Inge followed Avila's HR with a double down the right field line, Buck Showalter had seen enough of Bergy. His final line: 3.2 IP, 5 H, 4 R, 2 ER, 2 BB, 2 K. Replacing Bergesen was right handed pitcher Josh Rupe. On the surface Rupe had a tough day, but the fact is he ponied up three innings of relief that could make a difference later this week. I give him credit for that. I might even say it was a little bit Birdland. But what did he actually do, you ask? He retired Austin Jackson to end the fourth inning, for starters.Raise your hand if you think that Miguel Cabrera is a much, much better baseball player than Josh Rupe. How about Victor Martinez? Well, Rupe gave up back-to-back home runs to those two guys. Yeah, it would have been better if he didn't. But I mean, honestly. Am I getting upset over that? Compared to all the other stuff that happened in this game? Eh. With two outs in the seventh inning, Rupe had done all that he could. After a single to Ordonez and a walk to Cabrera, he was relieved by Mike Gonzalez. I know Rupe got a lot of, um, crap, in the gamethread, but I stand by the fact that he really wasn't so bad considering. Gonzo retired V-Mart on a fly ball to left to end the inning but looked just terrible in the 8th. Ryan Raburn doubled to left to start the inning against him, and the ball was smoked, bouncing into the stands for an automatic double. Peralta flied out to Adam Jones in center, but that ball was also hit very well and Adam made a very nice catch (he had a couple beauties out there tonight). Rayburn tagged up and went to third on the play. He'd score on a single by Avila (I'm sorry, ok?) for the Tigers' seventh run on the day, fifth knocked in by Avila. Kevin Gregg pitched the ninth inning and while he didn't allow any runs, he did give up two hits and looked kinda crappy. Are you surprised? No, me neither. All this talk about the pitching! What about the hitting, you say? Yeah...about that. Justin Verlander dominated the Orioles tonight, allowing just four hits in eight innings. He walked two and struck out nine. Verlander retired the O's in order in the first, second, and third innings, and started the fourth with a three pitch strikeout of Brian Roberts. His perfect game was broken up by Nick Markakis, though, who drew a walk. Derrek Lee, who hasn't done much in an O's uniform yet this season, launched a pitch to right field for a flag court home run. It cut the Tigers lead in half at 4-2, and Vladimir Guerrero followed Lee's HR with a single past the diving shortstop Peralta, but Verlander struck out Adam Jones and Matt Wieters to stop the threat. Verlander would allow one more run, this one in the sixth inning. Brian Roberts again led off and Verlander started him 0-2, but then gave Brian four straight balls for the O's second walk of the night. Verlander was very preoccupied with Brian throwing over to first five times during Markakis, Lee, and Vlad's at-bats. Brian finally got his chance with two outs and Guerrero at the plate, taking off for second and making all of Birdland cringe with his headfirst slide into second. He was safe, though, and scored on a single to right by Vlad. The throw home got away from Avila and Vlad lumbered down to second but was thrown out. He looked safe in the replay but man, watching him run is just painful. That'd be it for the O's offense, other than a Felix Pie single in the 8th. Joaquin Benoit pitched a perfect ninth for the Tigers, cementing the loss. The O's will try to win the rubber match tomorrow as Chris Tillman will try to out pitch Brad Penny.

But all it took was to watch the 18-year-old shortstop effortlessly glide to his left to field a ground ball, or stand in the batter's box and lace line drives into the gap to reach this conclusion: "Some people just look like they belong on the baseball field. Manny Machado looks like he belongs on a baseball field," said Brian Graham, the Orioles coordinator of minor league instruction. var adSkipCounter = 0;  The minor league season gets underway for most of the Orioles' affiliates on Thursday, and the clear headliner will be Machado, the third overall pick in 2010 out of Brito High School in Miami. Machado will start the season for Single-A Delmarva, but those who saw him play this spring are already imagining how quickly he could move through the system. That process will start Thursday as Machado plays his first game for the Shorebirds at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium against Greensboro. "Obviously, you have a goal and my goal is to get up there as soon as possible, but I'm just out here trying to play," said Machado, the Orioles' most heralded prospect since catcher Matt Wieters. "I'm not really looking at ending the season at Double-A or whatever it is. My goal right now is just to play baseball and hopefully win down there — try to change this around, get in the playoffs and just play hard and do my job." Machado, ranked as the 14th-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America, has done little to diminish the weighty expectations placed on him after agreeing to a $5.25 million signing bonus last August. In seven games for short-season Single-A Aberdeen last year, he went 10-for-29 (.345) with a double, triple and three RBIs. At a scaled-down instructional league for some of the organization's top prospects at Camden Yards late last season, Machado impressed former Orioles infielder and current roving coach Mike Bordick with his ability to pick things up quickly, and his eagerness to fit in. Official statistics for minor league spring training games are not available, but Machado did something on a daily basis this spring that left a coach or teammate shaking their head. "In all the years that I've been playing, I've never seen somebody swing the bat the way he does, or look so smooth defensively like he does," said minor league second baseman L.J. Hoes, a third-round pick in 2008 who is now the Orioles' fourth-best prospect according to Baseball America. "He's an 18-year-old-kid coming up in professional baseball. I remember how I was. For him, it seems that he is already at the point where I am now, just slowing the game down, being able to see different things, being able to see different plays. To me, he looks like a Double-A or Triple-A hitter right now. If he continues to work hard and continues to keep his head, I think you'll see him in Baltimore pretty soon." Knowing how much hype and unfair expectations were bestowed on Wieters, Orioles officials have seemingly made an effort to deflect attention off of the multi-tooled shortstop who batted .639 with 12 homers and 17 steals as a senior at Brito High and then hit .367 this past summer in helping lead the USA National Team to a gold medal at the Pan American Junior Championship. When the Orioles brought Machado up for a couple of Grapefruit League games this spring, manager Buck Showalter made sure not to single him out, mostly talking about the group summoned to the big league roster as a whole. Asked for his impressions on what he saw from Machado this spring, Orioles director of amateur scouting Joe Jordan simply smiled and attempted to change the subject. Team officials want to see how Machado handles the rigors of playing every day and dealing with a longer season. They want him to improve things like his baserunning and his two-strike approach, and they want to see how he handles some inevitable struggles and slumps that every young player goes through. "This game is failure," Machado said. "If you don't fail, if you don't know how to deal with failure, you shouldn't play. You have three hits in 10 at-bats, you are hitting .300 but you fail seven times." Machado, who is an impressive 6 feet 2, 185 pounds, worked out at the University of Miami this offseason with several major leaguers, including New York Yankees star third baseman Alex Rodriguez. Machado idolized Rodriguez, also a former Miami prep standout, growing up, and some aspects of his game have garnered comparisons to the three-time American League Most Valuable Player.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: 'thumbnails-f',     container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives',     placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives',     target_type: 'mix'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed'Blushing' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn't to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.
