They once employed a player whose surname came to epitomize offensive futility. Only one of the 28 cities that currently boast major league teams has never hosted a World Series game. That would be Seattle, and there seems a better chance of Starbucks banning coffee than that streak ending this October.That is because the Mariners have lost 16 straight games, a stretch of unprecedented misery that began innocuously enough, on a Wednesday afternoon at the Athletics — in Oakland, not Kansas City. It stalked the Mariners to Anaheim, lingered during the All-Star break, continued back at Safeco Field, cleared customs in Toronto and engulfed them over the weekend in Boston, where on Sunday they broke the franchise record. The Mariners’ reward was a series in Yankee Stadium, where showers delayed the start of Monday’s game by nearly two hours but did not prevent another sickening defeat, this one by 10-3 to the Yankees. Skies cleared in time for a 9:02 p.m. first pitch, quashing any hopes for a three-day monsoon.“It’s not a place you want to come into having lost, I don’t even know — what is it, 15?” infielder Adam Kennedy said before the game. “It just doesn’t get any easier.”It did not Monday, when Freddy Garcia worked seven and two-thirds innings, Mark Teixeira crushed a second-deck home run to left field, and a throw home by Seattle second baseman Dustin Ackley struck Derek Jeter’s bat, left in front of the plate. Of course it did. Photo       Seattle's Jason Vargas gave up eight runs, four of them earned, before leaving Monday night's game after the fourth inning.

(They will, right?) But until they do, they will evoke some of the modern era’s worst teams — like the 1988 Baltimore Orioles, who set the American League record by losing 21 in a row, or the 2005 Royals, who dropped 19 straight. That particular comparison is perhaps a bit unfair. That Kansas City team was already 25 games under .500, at 38-63, when its downward spiral began. These Mariners, after beating Oakland on July 5, were 43-43 and a surprise contender in the A.L. West, sitting two and a half games behind Texas and the Angels for the division lead.

In the streak’s first nine losses, they scored a total of 11 runs, failing to hit a home run. In their last seven, they scored 32 but allowed 56. Their team batting average during their losing streak is .227, and four regulars (Jack Cust, Justin Smoak, Adam Kennedy and Chone Figgins) entered Monday batting under the Mendoza line over this time — or, perhaps more fittingly, the Figgins line, which he has set at .182.Their All-Star closer, Brandon League, has pitched twice, both times trailing by at least four runs. Their pitching staff, which began Monday with the fourth-best earned run average (3.53) in the A.L., has a 5.97 E.R.A. during this streak, better than only Baltimore, another woeful team in last place. Their right-handed phenom, Michael Pineda, was shelled for seven runs in four and a third innings Sunday, his third poor outing in a row, and the Mariners believe he might have been tipping his pitches.

Not in Yahtzee, polo or competitive basket-weaving, either. To change their mojo, Wedge has tried conventional methods. He has called team meetings. He has juggled lineups — 16 times, 16 losses. He has encouraged and cajoled, exhorted and rebuked. When all that failed, he opted for superstition, shaving his handlebar mustache after Saturday’s game to get a reaction from his players. They noticed, though Ackley still wore his navy blue “Fear the Mustache” T-shirt around the clubhouse Monday.

You don’t wait 15 games to start doing things.” [{"headline":"Sports","summary":"Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, delivered to your inbox every week.","product-code":"SP","product-title":"Sports","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/sports?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=SP&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Race\/Related Newsletter","summary":"Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with New York Times journalists.","product-code":"RR","product-title":"Race Related","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/race-related?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=RR&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Your Money","summary":"Every week, get tips on retirement, paying for college, credit cards and the right way to invest.","product-code":"MY","product-title":"Your Money","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/your-money?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=business&contentId=MY&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"}]      Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Privacy Policy    Every player interviewed Monday agreed with Wedge that the demeanor around the team has not changed, that they do not feel sorry for themselves. They have done their best to stay upbeat — “given the circumstances,” Kennedy said — despite flushing away what had been a promising three months with three weeks of misfortune. When the Mariners last played at home, their skid stood at nine games. It could be at 18 by the time they return Friday, for a six-game homestand against Tampa Bay and Oakland.“It is a little frustrating because I think they were starting to come back to us a little bit, as opposed to the last couple years being rough for them,” Kennedy said of the fans. “I think we were starting to win them back and get their support, but it’s disappointing when you start getting that momentum with the fans and then lose it.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  To regain that support, the Mariners have to win. They want to remember what that feels like again.“Just play one day at a time,” left fielder Mike Carp said. “If we win, we win. If we lose, we lose. Unfortunately, we’ve been losing.”  A version of this article appears in print on July 26, 2011, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Wins and Answers Out of Reach for Mariners.

6  I know that many of you are regular readers of FanGraphs, so you might have already seen the news that Dave Cameron has been diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. I've never had the pleasure of meeting Dave in person, but he's an outstanding writer both at FanGraphs and on U.S.S. Mariner, and it was particularly shocking news to read this morning. Dave wrote about his diagnosis and the upcoming treatment on FanGraphs, and even that scary announcement was written with the eloquence we've come to know from him. He's suggested that if you can, go donate blood or platelets to the Red Cross, as supplies are critically low. Craig Robinson of Flip Flop Fly Ball wrote an article on Baseball Nation a few weeks ago about the Country of Baseball that exists on the Internet thanks to the network of baseball blogs and the community of Twitter, and he's right. I know a hundred baseball guys that I've never met, and Dave is one of them. He's one of our own, and that makes the news a bit more sobering than it might be otherwise. We spend a lot of time complaining about the Orioles (and rightly so) and investing more time and emotion into them than they deserve, but then something like this happens and it makes me realize how well things are going for me when the thing that often bothers me the most is a crappy baseball team. Everyone should have such problems.    My thoughts are with Dave and his family as they go through this difficult time. And for goodness sake, Mariners, win a game for the guy why don't you.
