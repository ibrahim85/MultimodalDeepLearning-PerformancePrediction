He kept taking in all the sights at Bobby Maduro Stadium in Miami — including the strange half-field tucked alongside left field, the position he was patrolling.“I kept looking to my right at this field,” Showalter recalled Tuesday evening, as if it were yesterday, before the Orioles’ game at Yankee Stadium was rained out.Showalter is now the manager of the Orioles, trying to help Baltimore become a force again in the brutal A.L. East. Every little bit helps.He was also paying attention to detail in his debut, 34 years ago. He had never seen a cutoff infield during his undergraduate days at Mississippi State, but it made perfect sense — three bases and home plate, perfect for practicing infield plays, without taking up much space. He was intrigued. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      “I went out the next day to take a look at it,” Showalter recalled.Imagine that — a 21-year-old after his first pro game, inspecting the grounds of the opposition, to see if he could learn something.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  He was in the Yankees’ chain, starting off in Fort Lauderdale, and he would never reach the majors as a player. But he always wondered how that cut-off infield at the Orioles’ field in Miami had come into being. Other teams have them now, of course, as baseball becomes ever more involved in method and process, with born teachers like William Nathaniel Showalter 3rd.Finally, a month or so ago, Showalter got to meet his managerial ancestor, the former fighting bantam rooster Earl Weaver. Showalter chatted with Weaver, the Orioles’ manager for 17 seasons, for a few minutes and remembered to ask him about that half-field back in Miami.They had a little space beyond left field, Weaver recalled, so they put in a half-field. You never know. Showalter recognized in Weaver the same seething hatred of mistakes he saw in Billy Martin, his mentor who promoted him to coach for the Yankees.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “We all make mistakes,” Weaver told Showalter. “But we don’t repeat them.” Not unless they wanted the manager pecking at them, the way he jabbed umpires with the bill of his cap. Nah, Showalter said, he did not necessarily see himself and Weaver as kindred souls. But what a great brain to pick for a few minutes.

Credit             Greg Fiume/Getty Images           Showalter is always paying attention. He was a manager in the Yankees’ farm system, sitting in Martin’s dugout one spring. Martin asked if anybody knew the opposing pitcher. Showalter volunteered that the guy could get rattled if you ran on him. They pulled a steal, grabbed a run, and Billy brought the boyish coach north with him as a coach.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “He’s all yours,” the coach Clete Boyer whispered to the clean-living Showalter, meaning part of his new job was roaming the night with Billy, trying to keep him out of trouble.The young man from western Florida would manage the Yankees and the Diamondbacks, both of whom won World Series shortly after he departed, and he managed the Rangers, who reached the World Series after he was gone. He took a sabbatical, but last August the Orioles hired him, and the team won 34 and lost 23, making him the first manager in 20 years to take over a team after Aug. 1 and have a winning record.

In an interview with Paul Solotaroff in the April issue of Men’s Journal, Showalter said he shouted at umpires to employ the same strike zone for Derek Jeter that they used for Orioles hitters. It sounded a little like sacrilege to squawk about the icon who broke in under Showalter in 1995.“These things happen,” Showalter was saying Tuesday night. “Every club does stuff like that. I love Derek Jeter. He’s as good a human being as he is a ballplayer. His substance is his style.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In the same article, Showalter is quoted as wondering if Boston’s general manager, Theo Epstein, could function with a smaller payroll, like that of Tampa Bay.

He’s a very well-prepared manager who understands what we’re going through.”The Orioles have a grand history — six pennants, three championships — embodied in Jim Palmer, the Hall of Fame pitcher, now a broadcaster with the team. On Tuesday, Palmer was carrying a tray in the dining room, and a full cup of soda began slip-sliding away. Palmer smoothly leveled the tray without spilling a drop.

In addition to improving overall fitness, Martin said, mixed martial arts can make an athlete mentally tougher.“You tolerate the pain and get through it,” he said. “Mentally, I know I’m in a good place because I worked hard.”Mixed martial arts is a combination of karate, judo, jujitsu, boxing, wrestling and tae kwon do. The sport is also popular in Brazil and Japan. Pay-per-view telecasts in the United States began in 1993, with the Ultimate Fighting Championship staging the most lucrative matches.

Dunn declined through the White Sox media-relations office.

The training gives them something different to push themselves through.” Photo       Yankees catcher Russel Martin used mixed martial arts training to help him get in shape for the season and recover from injury.  Credit             Steve Nesius/Reuters           Henderson said the workouts could indirectly help Penny’s strategy on the mound.“It might give Brad a little more confidence when he’s pitching inside,” Henderson said. “And he’s prepared in case anyone rushes the mound.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Jay Glazer, a football analyst for Fox Sports who runs MMAthletics with Randy Couture, a mixed martial arts star, has trained N.F.L. players in the sport. Glazer said his clients included Ryan Grant, Jared Allen, Clay Matthews and the Atlanta Falcons team.

A knee, a punch, followed by a kick. We have him do a ton of that for his hips. Power comes from his core, his hips and his legs, even though he uses his arm to pitch.”Mentally, Glazer said, the mantra is the same for baseball players as it is for N.F.L. players.“Own your space,” Glazer said several times. “We get the players thinking like a cage fighter. When the door shuts, it’s time to break that man’s will across from you. For Ryan, as a pitcher, it’s that 60 feet 6 inches that you own.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Rowland-Smith said the rigors of M.M.A. training made it easier to tolerate physical and mental challenges on the mound.

3 The Baltimore Orioles have been around for quite some time, but they have not always been the Orioles. They have gone through some changes over the years, but the Orioles name has stuck since 1954.How did they get their name, you might ask? Well, I'm glad you did.The Orioles franchise started out in 1901, but back then, they were called the Milwaukee Brewers. That team lasted only one year as they then moved and became the St. Louis Browns in 1902. The Browns were named after the St. Louis Brown Stockings, which was a team that won four consecutive pennants in the 1880s. Sadly for this version of the Browns, winning wasn't exactly in the cards for them, since during that span, they won only one pennant and had one playoff appearance. That team stayed there from 1902 until 1953.Not exactly the kind of franchise you'd want to be a part of, so when things are going rough, what's one way to snap out of it?You guessed it! The Browns then moved to Baltimore in 1954 and then became the Baltimore Orioles we know and love today, no matter how frustrating they can be at times. The Orioles are named after the Maryland state bird, and once they changed their name, things started to look up.The Orioles won their first World Series in 1966 as they swept the Los Angeles Dodgers. Baltimore would make three consecutive World Series appearances between 1969 to 1971 as they lost the '69 World Series to the New York Mets in five game before they defeated the Cincinnati Reds in 1970 in five games. The Orioles made it back again in 1971 only to lose a heartbreaking series to the Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games.Baltimore made it back to the World Series in 1979 as they lost another seven-game set to the Pirates. The O's made it back to the World Series in 1983 as they took on the Philadelphia Phillies and wound up winning that series in five games.From 1983 until 2011, the Orioles have only made it back to the playoffs twice, in 1996 and 1997, where they lost in the ALCS to the New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians, respectively. All in all, since moving to Baltimore, the Orioles have three World Series titles, six pennants, and 10 playoff appearances, a vast improvement over their St. Louis Brown forefathers.REFS:http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BAL/http://www.countytimes.com/articles/2011/04/04/life/doc4d9a14ee44edb349317705.txt 
6  Baltimore Orioles (6-3) @ New York Yankees (5-4) After dropping two of three to the Texas Rangers (and their first series of the year), the Orioles are heading up I-95 for a three-game set versus the New York Yankees. Even after two straight losses, the Orioles sit atop the AL East (thanks to the Boston Red Sox stealing their first two wins of the season) and have moved up to the seventh spot in the Power Rankings. The pitching (outside of Jake Arrieta and Chris Jakubauskas) was very good, but the bats failed to show. This is something that must change for the Orioles to continue winning games. Andrew_G has noted that the Orioles currently sport a .243 BABIP (batting average of balls in play), which suggests that the team is getting somewhat unlucky and should improve over a larger sample. Phew! That’s good news considering that the top regular in the lineup is Vladimir Guerrero with 10 hits and a .270 BA. In any case, nobody is getting on base and that has to get turned around. Derrek Lee seemed to be making much better contact this weekend, but guys like Luke Scott, Matt Wieters, and Adam Jones need to get it going. The O’s will also be returning to the Robert Andino/Cesar Izturis tandem at SS that we all came to know and love last season which cannot help the cause. The Yankees, on the other hand, will be looking to avenge two losses to the Red Sox over the weekend with a solid series back at home. Considering that they dropped two to Boston and then watched the Red Sox promptly get hammered by the other 1 win team (on national TV, no less), expect they’ll be ready to go. The Yankees will throw the middle of their rotation, so the Orioles will not face CC Sabathia. It’ll be another tough test for the pitchers, as the Yankees have produced 50 runs, tops in the division. Andrew_G also notes that the Orioles pitchers have allowed a .232 BABIP, which is bound to drift back toward the league average. There is significant rain in the forecast (1-2 rainouts possible) which might force some shuffling in the Orioles rotation. Brad Bergesen did not make his scheduled start for the Norfolk Tides this week and should be back with the team after J.J. Hardy is sent to the DL. A bench player (likely by the name of your favorite french fry substitute) is also expected to be added to roster. Bergy will make the start Wednesday and will be an upgrade (yes, you read that correctly) over Jakubauskas. Jake Arrieta will close out the series and must rebound from Saturday’s effort where he allowed 8 ER in just 3.1 innings.   Game 1 (Tuesday @ 7:05pm): Probable Pitchers:   BAL – Chris Tillman (0-0, 3.38 ERA) NYY – A.J. Burnett (2-0, 4.09 ERA)   Scouting Report:   Burnett relies mostly on a fastball/sinker combo to go along with his curveball. Fastball velocity generally around 92-93 and the changeup drops to the upper 80s. Strikeout numbers were down last season (6.99 K/9 from 8.48), but have been solid in two starts this season. Keeps the curveball down and away for hitters on both sides of the plate (really down and away to righties).   Key Stats:   Cesar Izturis is a career 4 for 12 off of Burnett. Adam Jones has had similar success, going 4-13. Luke Scott and Matt Wieters have not shared that same success (Wieters is hitless in 12 ABs). Chris Tillman has won his only start at Yankee Stadium, but did so while posting a 7.20 ERA. Alex Rodriguez is a threat with a .500 BA and the only Yankee HR of Tillman. Robinson Cano is 6 for 7.      Game 2 (Wednesday @ 7:05pm):   Probable Pitchers:   BAL – Brad Bergesen (0-1, 4.91 ERA) NYY – Phil Hughes (0-1, 16.50 ERA)   Scouting Report:   Hughes throws a fastball, cutter, and curveball. Velocity is down about 2-3 MPH on all three pitches this season so he’s throwing the cutter much more frequently. Posted decent strikeout numbers last season, but had just one in his first 2011 start. Likes the left side of the plate (from the pitcher’s prospective) with the cutter, coming in on lefties, but staying away from right-handed hitters.      Key Stats:   Hughes has good numbers against the Orioles, but he’s one guy that Luke Scott can hit. In 13 ABs, Luke has 7 hits for a .538 BA. Neither Derek Jeter nor Mark Teixeira have hits off of Bergesen. The rest of the lineup, however, has hit him fairly well.  Oddly enough, Joey Gathright (he who can jump a car) is 3-3 with a double and 3 SB in his career against Hughes…..   Game 3 (Thursday @ 7:05pm)   Probable Pitchers:   BAL – Jake Arrieta (1-1, 8.68 ERA) NYY – Ivan Nova (1-0, 6.10 ERA)   Scouting Report:   Throws three pitches, but sticks mostly to a low 90s fastball that he keeps away. Did not throw the curveball much to the righties in his first start this season. Was throwing the mid 80s changeup primarily against the lefties last year, but utilized it more often to righties this season.      Key Stats:   Derek Jeter has not hit the fastball well this season (pitchers have responded well by throwing limited breaking stuff). That’s good news for Jake Arrieta who sports a good mid 90s fastball.  Arrieta has not allowed a HR to a Yankee batter, albeit in very limited action. Matt Wieters has the lone Oriole HR off of Nova while Felix Pie is 0-3 with 2Ks.  
2  NEW YORK (AP) — The scheduled game between the Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees has been postponed because of rain.  No makeup date was immediately announced.  A.J. Burnett had been slated to pitch Tuesday night for the Yankees in the opener of a three-game series. Burnett is 2-0 with a 4.09 ERA after a poor 2010 season. He is 7-0 with a 3.91 ERA in 12 April starts with New York and 11-4 with a 4.47 ERA in 18 career starts against the Orioles.  Chris Tillman was Baltimore’s scheduled starter. The 22-year-old right-hander has a 3.38 ERA after two starts this year, both no-decisions.  It was the second rainout at Yankee Stadium in a week. Minnesota and New York were washed out last Wednesday night.  (Copyright 2011 by The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.)  var addthis_product = 'wpp-261'; var addthis_config = {"data_track_clickback":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == "undefined"){ addthis_share = {"url_transforms":{"shorten":{"twitter":"bitly"}},"shorteners":{"bitly":{"login":"cbslocal","apiKey":"R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca"}}};}
