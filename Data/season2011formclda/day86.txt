McLaren will assist Rizzo in scouting and other duties.

He could be a candidate.Johnson, 68, managed the Mets, the Dodgers, the Cincinnati Reds and the Baltimore Orioles over 14 seasons, compiling a 1,148-888 record. His 1986 Mets won the World Series, and his clubs finished first or second 11 times. He also led Team USA in the 2009 World Baseball Classic.

Riggleman’s departure was remarkable for its timing. The Nationals have been baseball’s hottest team, winning 12 of 13 games before a 3-0 loss Saturday to the White Sox in Chicago.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) — Derrek Lee had gone nearly seven weeks without hitting a home run — not nearly long enough to forget the sensation of getting good wood on a pitch and sending it soaring toward the seats.So when Lee made contact in the 12th inning Friday night, he knew his long-ball drought was over."I knew I got that one," said Lee, whose leadoff homer in the bottom of inning gave the Baltimore Orioles a 5-4 win over the Cincinnati Reds.Lee sent a 1-2 pitch from Jose Arredondo (0-3) into the seats in left field to end the marathon. It was Lee's fifth home run, the first since May 8."It felt good to finally get one over the fence," he said. "... I put a good swing on that one. If that one didn't go over the fence, we would have had some problems."Lee came into the game with a .238 batting average and had only 18 RBIs. He knew he wasn't contributing as much as expected, but on this night he went 3 for 5 and scored twice."I'm happy for him. I'm happy for us, too," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.It was his third career walkoff homer, the first since May 11, 2005.Cincinnati missed a chance to take the lead in the top of the 12th when Joey Votto was thrown out at the plate trying to score from first on a two-out double by Jay Bruce."That was a tough one to lose," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "We got out of trouble quite a few times tonight."Mike Gonzalez (1-1) worked the 12th for the Orioles, who led 4-0 after four innings. Baltimore stranded 13 and went 2 for 14 with runners in scoring position."It was a game that we thought we had in hand. We would hate to see that one get away," Lee said.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) — Four innings into their game against the Baltimore Orioles, the Cincinnati Reds found themselves in a familiar position: in desperate need of a comeback.The Reds rebounded from a four-run deficit to force extra innings, but Derrek Lee homered leading off the bottom of the 12th inning to provide Baltimore with a 5-4 victory.Lee's shot ruined a nice rally by Cincinnati, which trailed 4-0 after four innings."Unfortunately, we've been down a lot early," designated hitter Jonny Gomes said. "This team is definitely resilient. The pitching staff is resilient, being able to give up some runs early and then toeing that rubber and getting back out there and throwing up zeros."In the end, though, the Reds dropped their fourth straight extra-inning game and lost for the fifth time in their last seven games overall."One-nothing, 5-4, 10-0, it's still a loss," Gomes lamented.Lee sent a 1-2 pitch from Jose Arredondo (0-3) into the seats in left field to end the 3 hour, 55-minute marathon. It was Lee's fifth home run, the first since May 8."It felt good to finally get one over the fence," he said.Lee came into the game with a .238 batting average and had only 18 RBIs.

Votto headed for home after the ball eluded Adam Jones in center field, but he recovered in time to throw the relay to shortstop J.J. Hardy, whose throw home arrived just in time."Yeah, Jones got a glove on it. The ball just stopped. That ball rolls another two feet it's no problem," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "We didn't get any breaks tonight."Mike Gonzalez (1-1) worked the 12th for the Orioles, who led 4-0 after four innings.
