PETERSBURG, Fla. — The most critical moments of the Boston Red Sox season flickered on television in the Tampa Bay Rays’ clubhouse. Most players sipped beer and rooted loudly for their new favorite team, the Baltimore Orioles.But as Red Sox closer Jonathan Papelbon made one tense pitch after another in the ninth inning, Johnny Damon, who won championships with the Red Sox and the Yankees, stood at his locker answering questions for seven minutes and never once even glanced at the television.The Rays had just defeated the Yankees, 5-3, in dramatic fashion Tuesday night — with a late three-run homer and a triple play — to ensure that no matter what happened on that screen, the Rays still controlled their wild-card destiny. Asked if he was interested in watching events unfolding in Baltimore, Damon shook his head.“No, I’m actually ready to go home,” he said, and quickly walked out the door.One pitch later, Papelbon put the Orioles away, 8-7. After 161 games the Red Sox and Rays are deadlocked at 90-71. If a one-game playoff is needed after Wednesday, Game 163 will be played here Thursday afternoon to determine the American League wild card.

Credit             Chris O'Meara/Associated Press           It will be a well-deserved rest after Tuesday’s game, in which the Rays rallied to beat a Yankees team that continues to use most of its best players.Manager Joe Girardi sent out his regular lineup (minus Derek Jeter) and used all of his best relievers. Stars like Alex Rodriguez, Curtis Granderson and Robinson Cano played most of the game, and Rafael Soriano, Dave Robertson and Mariano Rivera were all summoned from the bullpen.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In a game that meant nothing to the Yankees, other than a chance to fine-tune their players as they prepare for Game 1 of their division series Friday, no one could say they weren’t trying. It was just that the Rays were, understandably, trying harder.

It’s really exciting.” Photo       The Rays' Johnny Damon after singling in the second for his 2,722nd hit to pass Lou Gehrig on the career list.  Credit             Chris O'Meara/Associated Press           With 22,820 fans in attendance — almost 4,000 more than the previous night — the ballpark was more energized than the night before when the Rays beat the Yankees to draw even with the Red Sox. With everything perhaps riding on one more game, Wednesday’s crowd should be even larger, and louder.The crowd came to life in the eventful sixth, when the Yankees took the lead and loaded the bases with nobody out. But catcher Russell Martin, who had homered in the third, hit a bouncer right to Evan Longoria, who fielded the ball with his right foot on third base. He fired to second, where Ben Zobrist made the relay to first, ahead of the diving Martin.It was the 25th triple play the Yankees had hit into and the first since 2000. It was the third triple play in the Rays’ history, and the first in five years.

2  I blogged last week about the Orioles being able to play spoilers. I never imagined it could be this good. Tuesday night the orioles have the chance to beat my least favorite team, with my least favorite pitcher on the mound. With Monday nights win against the Red Sox and the Rays beating the Yankees, the wild card race is all tied up with 2 games left for each team. The Orioles will face Eric Bedard, my absolute least favorite person in sports, with the opportunity of knocking them out of the playoffs. Even if the Orioles lose the next 2 games, if the Rays hold serve at home there will be a 1 game playoff and the Red Sox will be pitching their 3 best pitchers in this series. If the Orioles happen to sweep the Red Sox they will get to 70 wins. Not the type of meaningful games in September i was looking for, but this will have to do.  var addthis_product = 'wpp-261'; var addthis_config = {"data_track_clickback":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == "undefined"){ addthis_share = {"url_transforms":{"shorten":{"twitter":"bitly"}},"shorteners":{"bitly":{"login":"cbslocal","apiKey":"R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca"}}};}

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) — The Boston Red Sox have finally fallen all the way back to pack, and now they've got only two games left to make it right.The Red Sox found another way to lose, this time on a broken-bat single and an inside-the-park homer, and their 6-3 defeat against the Baltimore Orioles on Monday night dropped them into a tie in the AL wild-card race.Boston's 17th loss in 22 games enabled Tampa Bay to pull even in the duel for the league's final playoff spot. The Rays, who beat the New York Yankees 5-2, trailed by nine games after play on Sept. 3.The Red Sox had either stood atop the AL East or led the wild-card race every day since before play on May 24.In spite of the epic collapse, Boston can squeeze into the playoffs by winning its last two games. Then, at worst, the Red Sox will face the Rays in a one-game playoff."We win every game, we're in the playoffs," right fielder Adrian Gonzalez said. "It's definitely in our hands."Problem is, the Red Sox haven't won two in a row since August."We've backed ourselves about as far as we can go," manager Terry Francona said.With the score 2-all in the sixth inning, Boston starter Josh Beckett (13-7) allowed four runs in an uprising that began with Vladimir Guerrero becoming the career hits leader among Dominican-born players.Guerrero broke a tie with Julio Franco by bouncing a single up the middle, his 2,587th career hit. The 36-year-old Guerrero then stole second base, and after a two-out walk to Mark Reynolds, Chris Davis broke his bat hitting a soft liner to right that brought home the go-ahead run."I didn't make pitches when I needed to," Beckett said. "I tried to bounce a changeup to Davis there and I leave it up and he serves it to right field."Robert Andino followed with a deep fly to center that Jacoby Ellsbury had in his glove before crashing into the wall. Andino sprinted around the bases and made it home as the relay throw bounced past catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia.Boston loaded the bases with one out in the eighth, but Pedro Strop struck out Saltalamacchia and retired Marco Scutaro on a grounder.Although Dustin Pedroia hit an RBI single in the ninth, the Red Sox stranded two runners and fell to 6-19 in September, the second-worst record in the majors behind the Minnesota Twins. It's also Boston's second worst September, behind a 4-18 mark in 1926, according to STATS LLC.Jed Lowrie homered for the Red Sox, whose September swoon includes four losses in five games against Baltimore.Beckett allowed six runs and seven hits in six innings. The right-hander won four straight decisions before losing to the Orioles twice in six days."We've got to win games, and we're not going to do it when your starting pitcher gives up six runs," Beckett said.Troy Patton (2-1) retired all five batters he faced after entering for starter Tommy Hunter, who gave up one earned run in five innings."It's a relentless lineup, and that's why I'm so proud of our pitchers," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "Tommy gave us what he had today. He was barking pretty good there the last inning or so with the groin (injury)."Boston placed runners on second and third with two outs in the first before Hunter issued an intentional walk to Gonzalez and retired Lowrie on a fly ball. The Red Sox bounced back with an unearned run in the second on a two-out throwing error by rookie left fielder Matt Angle.Matt Wieters tied it in the bottom half with an opposite-field drive into the left-field seats. Wieters has 21 homers this year after totaling 20 in his first two big league seasons.Lowrie led off the fourth with his sixth home run, the third against Baltimore. Boston then got runners on the corners with two outs before Nick Markakis made a sliding catch of Carl Crawford's sinking liner to right.The Orioles drew even at 2 in the fifth on an RBI single by Davis. But with the bases loaded and one out, Beckett retired J.J. Hardy on a popup and struck out Markakis.NOTES: Boston C Jason Varitek was a late scratch. He took a ball off his left knee in Sunday's second game against New York. He was replaced by Saltalamacchia, who left in the eighth when struck near the throat by a foul ball. ... Showalter received in-house treatment for an ankle injury early in the game but was back by the second inning. ... Ellsbury's second-inning double extended his hitting streak against Baltimore to 34 games, longest by a Red Sox player against another team in the history of the franchise. ... Francona said he hasn't decided who will start Wednesday's game. It could be 15-game winner Jon Lester on three days rest. ...

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) — Vladimir Guerrero reached first base, flashed his trademark smile and doffed his batting helmet to the crowd.Soon after setting the record for career hits by a Dominican-born player, the Baltimore Orioles designated hitter scored the go-ahead run in a 6-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Monday night.Guerrero broke a tie with Julio Franco with his 2,587th hit. It took him 16 seasons to do it, compared to 23 for Franco."I played a lot of years, so it felt very good, satisfying to get that hit," Guerrero said through an interpreter.The single played a key role in helping the Orioles drop Boston into a tie for the AL wild-card lead.Boston's 17th loss in 22 games enabled Tampa Bay to finally pull even in the duel for the league's final playoff spot. The Rays, who beat the New York Yankees 5-2, trailed by nine games after play on Sept. 3.With the score 2-all in the sixth inning, Boston starter Josh Beckett (13-7) allowed four runs in an uprising that began with Guerrero bouncing a grounder up the middle.
