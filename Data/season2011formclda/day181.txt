But seldom has a bizarre set of circumstances ever occurred that left them with the sick and sinking feeling they had shortly after the clock struck midnight Wednesday night at Camden Yards.Taking a one-run lead into the ninth inning against the Baltimore Orioles, one out away from a 3-2 victory and an extension of their season, closer Jonathan Papelbon surrendered three straight hits as the Red Sox dropped a 4-3 decision to put their postseason fate into the hands of the Yankees in St. Petersburg, Fla.Moments later, Evan Longoria homered to give the Tampa Bay Rays an 8-7 victory in 12 innings and the American League wild-card berth, finishing off a historic collapse by the Red Sox, who led the Rays by nine games on Sept. 4.If anything, the final night of the regular season turned out to be a microcosm of the month for the Red Sox and the Rays. The ending was especially stunning as Carl Crawford — the Red Sox’ $142 million free-agent left fielder taken from the Rays — failed to catch a sinking liner off the bat of Robert Andino, sending Nolan Reimold home with the winning run.

I don’t think I’ve ever been part of something like this. It will go down as one of the worst collapses in history.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Having lost 20 of 27 September games, the Red Sox will suffer a long, cold winter mulling over countless what-ifs.“We had 161 other games besides this one to get into the playoffs,” said the second baseman Dustin Pedroia, whose home run had given the Red Sox their 3-2 lead in the fifth. “We didn’t. It’s our fault. It wasn’t just this game.”But from this excruciating game, the Red Sox will remember being unable to push across an insurance run or two against the Baltimore bullpen in the eighth and ninth innings Wednesday night.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In the eighth, shortstop Marco Scutaro turned to see if a drive into left-center field by Crawford would be caught and his hesitation led to him being thrown out at the plate. In the ninth, the Red Sox failed to score after putting men on first and third with none out.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “We wanted so desperately to win,” said Red Sox Manager Terry Francona, whose two-year option on his expiring contract has not been picked up yet by the Red Sox. “We just couldn’t hold on.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Their night began so promisingly, the good news from the west coast of Florida flashing in their faces on the scoreboard in right field. The Yankees took a 5-0 lead over the Rays when Mark Teixeira hit a grand slam in the second inning. The Boston fans in the crowd let out a roar that might have cracked a few warehouse windows.The Rays, later falling behind by 7-0, had to be on the way down, and if they were, all the Red Sox had to do was defeat the Orioles, the annoying but lowly, last-place Orioles, and they would be home free, on the postseason road.

When the rain stopped and the tarp was removed, they reappeared in their dugout just in time to see that Mariano Rivera was not on to close for the Yankees and to witness Dan Johnson’s pinch-hit home run with two outs that sent the game into extra innings.

Privacy Policy    All the Red Sox had wanted was a chance to play on, even if it had to be a 163rd game against the Rays in St. Petersburg. To that end, Boston’s executive vice president and general manager, Theo Epstein, was said to be exploring the possibility of claiming a starting pitcher off waivers — Fox Sports reported them considering the Kansas City left-hander Bruce Chen.Convention and summerlong form had abandoned the Red Sox during a steep slide that left them tied with the Rays. Francona’s lineup reflected their desperation. Jon Lester was pitching on three days’ rest, and he provided six solid innings. Ryan Lavarnway, the September call-up who started at catcher Tuesday night by default and hit the first two home runs of his major league career, was behind the plate again despite the availability of the semi-regular Jarrod Saltalamacchia.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Lavarnway hit fifth against the Orioles’ right-hander Alfredo Simon while Crawford batted eighth, his contract notwithstanding.“Right now what we do as a team is so much more important than what we do individually,” said Francona, with the mind-set of a franchise teetering on the abyss.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Lavarnway did not get a big hit but he acquitted himself well when Scutaro fielded a fifth-inning bouncer by Reimold and threw out Mark Reynolds trying to score from third.Scutaro also made a terrific play in the sixth. With two on and none out, he ranged far to his left for Vladimir Guerrero’s grounder and flipped behind him to Pedroia to start a 6-4-3 double play. The Rays were still losing. The Red Sox had every reason to believe.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Big trouble seemed to be brewing for the Red Sox when Alfredo Aceves — a former Yankee in the ever-thickening plot — hit two batters when play resumed in the seventh. But Aceves struck out Andino and got the troublesome J. J. Hardy on a bouncer before giving way to Daniel Bard in the eighth and Papelbon in the ninth, when it all went awry.

He got two strikes Reimold, who drove an outside fastball into the right-center gap for a ground-rule double. Then came Andino’s drive toward Crawford, whose inability to catch it concluded a dismal first season in Boston.While the Orioles celebrated, the Red Sox trudged into their clubhouse, just in time to see Longoria’s second home run of the game in St. Petersburg officially end their season.

At right is Orioles catcher Matt Wieters. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) — The Boston Red Sox celebrated a rare September victory for about 20 minutes before turning their attention toward their next game — the last and most important of the 162-game schedule.The Red Sox maintained a share of the AL wild-card lead Tuesday night, using four home runs to beat the Baltimore Orioles 8-7 and set up a dramatic conclusion to the regular season.The skidding Red Sox were 6-19 this month before rebounding to edge the last-place Orioles. The win, combined with Tampa Bay's 5-3 victory over the New York Yankees, kept Boston and the Rays tied with one game left.After blowing a nine-game lead in the span of 23 days, the Red Sox will send Jon Lester (15-9) to the mound against Baltimore on Wednesday night in an effort to get into the postseason for the fourth time in five years. Lester, Boston's winningest pitcher, will be throwing on three days' rest.A month ago, the Red Sox would shudder at the prospect of a must-win situation on the final day. But here they are, and they intend to make the best of it."I think it's really good for baseball, not so good for my stomach," manager Terry Francona said. "It's exciting. If you don't want to show up (Wednesday) and play, you've got no pulse. My goodness, I can't remember being that nervous in a long time. Go back to the hotel and not sleep, and then show up and see what we can do."Boston will be looking to put together its first winning streak since sweeping a doubleheader from Oakland on Aug. 27. If the Rays and Red Sox remain tied after Wednesday, Tampa Bay will host a one-game playoff Thursday."Everybody's been watching the scoreboard and knowing that we need to win tonight so we can come back (Wednesday) and fight through it again," Boston slugger David Ortiz said. "I hope if I'm still here next year we can make it easier. We're playing like this is a playoff already."Rookie Ryan Lavarnway became the unlikeliest of heroes for Boston, hitting his first two major league homers after being thrust into the lineup because of injuries to catchers Jarrod Saltalamacchia (sore collarbone) and Jason Varitek (knee).Lavarnway, a Yale philosophy major who never played a big league game before August, hit a three-run drive in the fourth inning and added a solo shot for an 8-4 lead in the eighth."Besides what he did offensively, I thought he ran the game, I thought he had a lot of poise," Francona said. "That was one of the more exciting things to watch. We've seen a lot of interesting things here over the years, but that was right near the top."Lavarnway said, "It feels good, but the job's not done. We still got to go out (Wednesday) and win another ballgame."Jacoby Ellsbury and Marco Scutaro also connected for Boston, which scored all its runs on home runs.Alfredo Aceves (10-2) pitched 3 2-3 innings of three-hit relief for the Red Sox, who survived homers from Baltimore's Matt Wieters and Adam Jones.After the Orioles scored twice in the eighth off Daniel Bard to make it 8-6, Jonathan Papelbon survived a hectic ninth for his 31st save. Wieters drove in a run with a grounder and Baltimore had the potential tying run at second with two outs before Jones grounded out on a 3-2 pitch."Everything we got, we needed," Francona said. "We hung on for dear life."Said Jones: "We battled down to the final pitch. That's the way I live. You know we ain't going to quit."Pitching at Camden Yards for the first time since being traded by Baltimore to Seattle in February 2008, Boston starter Erik Bedard gave up three runs and five hits in 3 1-3 innings. The left-hander struck out six but needed 84 pitches to get 10 outs.Bedard retired the first two batters without difficulty, then walked Nick Markakis and yielded an RBI double to Vladimir Guerrero to fall behind 1-0.Boston took the lead in the third against rookie Zach Britton (11-11) when Scutaro hit a two-out double and Ellsbury followed with his 32nd homer. Ellsbury has hit in 35 straight games against the Orioles, a streak that began on April 17, 2009.Lavarnway connected on a 3-2 pitch in the fourth following singles by Ortiz and Adrian Gonzalez. Wieters answered in the bottom half with his 22nd home run, the second in two nights, to make it 5-3.A triple by Carl Crawford and Scutaro's homer off Jason Berken made it 7-3 in the sixth. Jones led off the bottom half with a homer off Aceves.NOTES: Boston's Jed Lowrie started in the cleanup spot for the first time in his career. He went 0 for 5 with two strikeouts. ... Saltalamacchia was available if needed. Before the game he said, "I feel good, I feel like I can perform, but if it takes today to be 100 percent tomorrow, then that's what we'll do." ... Francona said RHP Clay Buchholz, who's on the 60-day DL with a back strain, could find his way onto the postseason roster. ... For the second time in two nights, play was interrupted when a fan ran onto the field. ... Boston starters have a 7.28 ERA in September. ... Alfredo Simon will pitch Wednesday for the Orioles.
