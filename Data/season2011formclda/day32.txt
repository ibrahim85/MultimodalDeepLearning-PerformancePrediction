He doesn’t give in.”Two innings later, David Ortiz hit a two-run homer during a six-run burst that broke the game open.The loss was Weaver’s first of the season. Scratched Sunday because of a stomach virus, Weaver (6-1) gave up three runs and six hits, struck out six and walked one in six innings. He was trying to become the first pitcher since 1891 to go 7-0 by May 2. Sadie McMahon of the Baltimore Orioles from the American Association was the last to open 7-0 by the second day of May.It was Boston’s second straight win after four losses in five games, and improved its record to 5-0 against the Angels this season. The Red Sox, who swept four games in Anaheim from April 21 through 24, have beaten Los Angeles 14 of the past 15 games.
