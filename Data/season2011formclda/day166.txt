Between them is a small stand, just a few inches high, with a $1 coin. Cito Gaston, the manager of those teams, gave the coin to the receptionist for good luck when he retired two years ago. She displays it as a placeholder for the next trophy, because the coin is dated 1993.Oh, for those days at the SkyDome, when every night was a party. The Blue Jays averaged more than 50,000 fans a game in 1993, the third consecutive season with four million customers. Today’s team can hardly imagine.“The only day they can really compare it to is opening day, when we get 48,000 and the place is electric here from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.,” said the former pitcher Pat Hentgen, now the bullpen coach for the Blue Jays, who have not made the playoffs since Joe Carter’s home run in Game 6 won the 1993 World Series. “I try to tell the guys that it was like that every day when I broke in.”The Baltimore Orioles had the next-best record in the American League East during Toronto’s seasons of glory. They had their own chances at the World Series later in the decade, losing the American League Championship Series in 1996 and ’97. Every year since, the Orioles have had a losing record.

There used to be a Hard Rock Cafe above right field, but it did not renew its lease. Billboards now cover 66 windows of another empty restaurant above center field. Aaron Hill and John McDonald, infielders who were traded last month, still have giant banners in their honor on the side of the stadium.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The city was buzzing last weekend, but not for baseball. Just down Bremner Boulevard, Air Canada Centre hosted an American Idols concert on Friday and a Keith Urban show on Saturday. Movie stars flocked to the Toronto Film Festival. The three baseball games drew only 45,895 fans, easily the lowest attendance for any series in the majors last weekend.For the fourth season in a row, the Blue Jays will almost certainly finish fourth while the Orioles finish last. Yet, in some ways, this was baseball in its purest form, the game for the sake of the game, with nothing to prove in the standings. The teams fought for three compelling days, one game ending with a go-ahead hit and the two others with the tying run at the plate.Both teams have visions of escaping their status as afterthoughts in the roughest division. If baseball adds another wild card to the postseason, as it hopes to do in the near future, the teams would have an extra sliver of hope that their efforts will pay off.

But now comes the hard part. The teardown is easy. The buildup’s very challenging.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Friday: Orioles 2, Blue Jays 0For his 32nd birthday, in April, Jeremy Guthrie’s wife gave him Michael J. Fox’s memoir, “Lucky Man,” which Guthrie enjoyed. This morning, Guthrie wakes up in Toronto and finds a quotation from Fox on Twitter: “If you want to be an agent of change, it starts with you and what you’re made of.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Guthrie reposted it to his 22,000 followers. He likes the message and thinks it sets a positive tone for his day. Photo       A game-winning hit still meant a lot to the Blue Jays' Brett Lawrie, left, and J.P. Arencibia even if it meant little in the standings and the crowd was sparse.  Credit             Fred Thornhill/Reuters           “I’m not winning,” says Guthrie, a Baltimore right-hander, “so I’ve got to change something.”For the second time in three years, Guthrie leads the A.L. in losses, with 17. As he prepares for his start at the ballpark Friday, the opposite clubhouse stirs to life. The Blue Jays have just taken three of four from the reeling Boston Red Sox, and they are loose, confident.

On this night, in Milwaukee, Marcum faces his former Blue Jays teammate Roy Halladay of the Philadelphia Phillies. It is a possible playoff preview, 485 miles from Toronto.“To get to the playoffs in this sport, it’s such an accomplishment,” says Anthopoulos, who started his career with the Montreal Expos and has never reached the postseason. “I hope it ends up being a great trade for us, but it’s already a tremendous trade for the Brewers.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Lawrie was born in British Columbia in 1990, too late to experience the golden age of Canadian baseball. He gravitated to stars like Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees and now seems comfortable as their peer. Since his promotion a month ago, Lawrie leads all rookies in home runs, total bases and on-base percentage plus slugging percentage.“The whole point of Triple-A is to prepare yourself so you don’t have to worry about anything,” he says. “Just worry about playing baseball. Right when I got here, that’s all I wanted to do.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Lawrie is batting sixth, and in the second inning, he sacrifices Adam Lind to third after a leadoff double. But Guthrie strands Lind and never allows a run.With Toronto trailing in the eighth, Hentgen’s bullpen phone rings. Kyle Drabek, the centerpiece of the Halladay deal in 2009, gets loose. Drabek had more walks than strikeouts when the Blue Jays demoted him in June, and now he is relieving for the first time in years.

Mike Flanagan, a former pitcher for the Orioles and the Blue Jays, used to be Hunter’s partner for games in Toronto. But Flanagan died last month at 59 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.His death cut to the core of the Orioles, who wear a memorial patch on their jerseys. Flanagan had been a popular part of the scenery as a player, executive and broadcaster since the 1970s. He was a link to better days. Photo       Baltimore won the A.L.

First up is Zach Britton, who won five of his first six starts this season, then one of his next 14.Brian Matusz will be next. A former first-round pick, Matusz is 1-7 with a 9.84 earned run average. He tosses lightly in the outfield while Britton works on the mound.

This kid right here, Matusz, same thing. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger in the long haul. The good ones will fight back. This division and this league — this level of play, period — will separate it for you. Just watch.”Today, Showalter watches Rick VandenHurk, a tall right-hander from the Netherlands. The Toronto slugger Jose Bautista — so flustered by Guthrie on Friday that he slammed his bat against a dugout railing after a strikeout — lashes a home run in the first inning. Lawrie does the same in the second. Photo       Better days in Toronto were long ago: Joe Carter after his Series-winning home run in the ninth inning of Game 6 in 1993.

One of them is the journeyman Willie Eyre, 33, whose middle name is Mays. His mother was a Dodgers fan but admired the Giants center fielder.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Eyre faces one hitter, Bautista, and retires him on a pop foul. Like all of the pitchers so far, he was not on the Orioles’ opening-day roster. Closer Kevin Gregg is an exception. A Blue Jay last year, he is booed when he enters with a one-run lead in the bottom of the ninth.With the bases empty and two outs, the Blue Jays’ hitter is Kelly Johnson, whose acquisition in a trade with Arizona last month reflects the long-term logic behind many of Anthopoulos’s moves. The Blue Jays needed a second baseman and plan to offer Johnson salary arbitration this winter. If he accepts, they will have a second baseman for 2012 on a one-year, nonguaranteed deal.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But if Johnson declines and leaves as a free agent, the Blue Jays would receive high draft picks. Anthopoulos, who has greatly increased the team’s scouting staff, would have more chances to flood an already thriving farm system.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “Everything comes down to opportunity cost,” Anthopoulos says. “If you go this route, what’s the impact? There’s always options, right?”Johnson works a walk, and Gregg crumbles. A single, a hit batter and a wild pitch tie the score before the rookie catcher J. P. Arencibia wins the game with a pinch-hit single to left. In the clubhouse, Arencibia wears a Maple Leafs cap backward as he speaks for the cameras. Pitcher Brett Cecil shoves a hockey stick at him, and Arencibia knows what to do.

In four months before Showalter took over, they won 32 games. In his two months they won 34. With a few veteran hitters added to the stable of young pitchers, the thinking went, maybe the Orioles could compete.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Showalter knew better, but made a point not to say it and rattle the good vibes. Some of the veterans, like shortstop J. J. Hardy, have produced. But the pitching has been dreadful.“It’s always going to come down to starting pitching and defense,” said catcher Matt Wieters, a young All-Star who uses a vintage Orioles helmet under his mask. “That’s how you’re going to win the division. Look at a team like Tampa. Their offense doesn’t score many runs, but they’re able to compete because they have great starting pitching.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles, alas, have the worst starters’ earned run average in the majors, at 5.36. They have logged the fewest innings, an average of roughly five and a third per game. The Rays’ starters average almost six and two-thirds, the most in the majors, with an A.L.-best 3.49 E.R.A.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  On Sunday the Orioles use Tommy Hunter, who started (and lost) Game 4 of the World Series for Texas last fall. The Blue Jays counter with Dustin McGowan, making his first start in 38 months after two shoulder operations and another on his knee. McGowan wastes no time reflecting on his journey.

It’s time to get to business.”Business is bad on Sunday, with a four-pitch walk to start the game and four other walks over three innings. But Hunter cannot hold a 5-3 lead, allowing a leadoff homer in the seventh to David Cooper, who hit .364 this season to win the Pacific Coast League batting crown. After a flyout to the wall, Hunter faces center fielder Adam Loewen, who knows the Orioles well.

He had a 5.38 E.R.A. in parts of three seasons, longing for a different career.“I remember facing Rick Ankiel in spring training, and he got a hit off me,” Loewen says, referring to the pitcher turned outfielder. “I remember thinking, Man, I wish I was doing what he’s doing. I just needed an opportunity.”’  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Elbow troubles provided it. Loewen, who grew up near Vancouver, British Columbia, retired as a pitcher and signed as an outfielder with the Blue Jays, ready to scale the minor league ladder again. After three seasons, he returned this month, and now, in the seventh inning, he crushes a 93 mile-per-hour fastball, down and in, over the center-field fence.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  It is Loewen’s first career home run — against 14 allowed — and it ties the score, 5-5.“It’s a bad feeling to give up a home run,” he says. “I don’t ever want to be on that side of it again.”After two more hits, Willie Mays Eyre comes in to face Bautista again. This time, Bautista wins the duel, with a sacrifice fly to center to drive in the go-ahead run. The Blue Jays hold on, making a winner of Joel Carreno, a 24-year-old right-hander from the Dominican Republic who jumped from Class AA last month.

The rookies revel in the attention, and suddenly it is Halloween in the clubhouse, with a chicken and a baby doll and Drabek dressed as a beer keg.Jose Molina, the veteran catcher, hollers, “Gate 9!” and the rookies take his cue. They roll their luggage out of the stadium and onto the sidewalk, then cluster together on a street corner across from the press gate on the other side of Bremner.They huddle there, snapping photographs and laughing, and soon the team bus rolls by to retrieve them.

The postseason creeping into view, this team has started to amass hits and score runs again, even against one of the best pitchers in baseball.Felix Hernandez, the 2010 American League Cy Young Award winner and a perennial Yankees nemesis, was on the mound for the Seattle Mariners looking for his 15th win of the season and his seventh in 10 career starts against the Yankees. This was never supposed to be the easy night that it turned out to be.The game actually began according to past form. Hernandez set down the first six batters he faced, three by strikeout, and his personal section of fans in left field wearing yellow king shirts, in honor of King Felix, had to be thinking this would be another one of his dominant performances.But the game changed sharply in the Yankees’ favor over the next two innings. The visitors manufactured one run in the third, then exploded for five runs in the fourth inning on their way to an impressive 9-3 victory over the Mariners at Safeco Field.

Combined with his last start against the Baltimore Orioles on Sept. 6, Hughes (5-5) has allowed 3 runs and 10 hits in 12 innings.“For Phil, it comes down to location,” Girardi said. “His curveball seemed to be sharper and he got some strikeouts with it.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Hernandez (14-12) gave up six runs in all, matching the second most he has given up all season. He allowed nine hits, including a solo home run to Mark Teixeira and a two-run shot to Chris Dickerson, who was playing right field while Nick Swisher played first base and Teixeira was the designated hitter.

Warren/Associated Press           Dickerson collected two hits off Hernandez, and then jammed his right thumb badly when he slid in to steal second base in his first at-bat. His thumb went numb, he said, and he was worried he had broken it. It wasn’t broken, and in his next at-bat he drove a fastball into the seats from a very good pitcher.

Cano also had a double and a single off Hernandez.

After that I was confident and relaxed in the box.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Although Hernandez is not having a year as impressive as his previous two — his 3.30 earned run average is his highest since 2008, when it was 3.45 — he is still considered among the most treacherous pitchers in baseball. That made the fourth inning almost seem to defy logic as the Yankees battered Hernandez like a September call-up.

Then came two more hits.Teixeira started the inning with his 37th home run of the season, into the seats in right field. Cano followed with a double into the right-field corner and went to third on Swisher’s single to left. Eric Chavez then lifted a long fly to center field, and Cano trotted home.Brett Gardner doubled to left to score Swisher, and Gardner then scored on Dickerson’s first home run of the season, and the ninth of his career. Clearly, something was not right with the King. Perhaps the most impressive thing he did all game was to finally stanch the bleeding, then stay in for two more scoreless innings.

Brandon Guyer and B.J. Upton scored on the play. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) — B.J. Upton was far more delighted with a victory than etching his name in the Tampa Bay record book — twice.Upton doubled twice and took two walks to set a team mark by reaching base in nine straight plate appearances, and the resurgent Rays beat the Baltimore Orioles 5-2 on Monday night for their fifth straight victory.Upton went 4 for 4 with a walk on Sunday against Boston, then reached base four successive times against the Orioles before striking out in the eighth inning. Eight times previously a Tampa Bay player got on base in eight straight plate appearances, the last one being Upton in May 2008.The two walks made Upton the Rays' career leader with 375. Carlos Pena held the record with 373.Upton was pleased with his accomplishment, only because it contributed to Tampa Bay's eighth win in nine games. The Rays moved within three games of idle Boston in the AL wild-card race after trailing by nine on Sept. 2."I just want to help this team whether it's offensively or defensively, and right now it happens to be on the offensive end," Upton said. "I feel good right now, and I'll just try to feel good as long as I can. The hits are just falling."And manager Joe Maddon is loving it."That's pretty impressive. He's getting good at-bats," Maddon said. "He's been taking his walks and when they come in the zone he's hitting it. He's been fantastic, he's been really high-end of late, maybe as good as I've seen him. He's playing with a lot of focus and intensity."Ben Zobrist had three hits and three RBIs for the Rays and Jeff Niemann (10-7) gave up two runs and six hits in 7 2-3 innings. Neimann's previous outing, a defeat against Texas on Sept. 6, was Tampa Bay's lone loss in nine games.Joel Peralta worked the ninth for his third save.After playing Baltimore twice more, the Rays head to Boston for a four-game series. They would love to arrive at Fenway Park down by three games or fewer."It will be more exciting," Peralta said.The victory assured the Rays (82-64) of their fourth consecutive winning season. Only the New York Yankees (19), Red Sox (14) and Philadelphia Phillies (9) have a longer current streak.But Tampa Bay is looking for more, such as its third playoff appearance in four years."There's nothing to complain about right now," Maddon said. "We've worked ourselves back into a good spot."Matt Wieters homered for the Orioles, who have dropped three straight. Baltimore needs to go 5-11 the rest of the way to avoid the third 100-loss season since the team moved from St. Louis in 1954.Rookie starter Zach Britton (9-10) gave up five runs, five hits and four walks in five innings. He was 3-0 in his last four starts."It starts and stops with fastball command," manager Buck Showalter said. "That's one of the reasons Tampa is doing a good job with their starters. They have guys with good command of the fastball. Zach didn't have it tonight."The Rays went up 3-0 in the third. Brandon Guyer doubled and Upton walked before Zobrist hit a two-run double and scored on a two-out single by Sean Rodriguez.Upton hit a leadoff double in the fifth and scored on a sacrifice fly by Johnny Damon for a 4-0 lead.Robert Andino doubled in a run for Baltimore in the bottom half, and Wieters hit his 18th homer in the sixth.Upton doubled off Jeremy Accardo leading off the seventh and Zobrist delivered an RBI single.NOTES: The Rays have won 22 straight when scoring at least five runs. ... Tampa Bay purchased the contract of LHP Matt Moore from Triple-A Durham, giving the Rays 32 players on the active roster. ... Baltimore activated RHP Jason Berken (forearm strain) from the 15-day DL. ... Tampa Bay is 6-1 in Baltimore and 3-6 against the Orioles at home. ... The Rays send 12-game winner David Price to the mound Tuesday night against Baltimore's Alfredo Simon, who is 1-0 lifetime in five appearances against Tampa Bay.

Guerrero had one hit in four at-bats in the Orioles' 5-2 loss. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) — Waiting for Zach Britton to throw strikes made it difficult for the Baltimore Orioles to play spoiler against the surging Tampa Bay Rays.Britton needed 100 pitches to get through five innings, and the Orioles offered little resistance Monday night in a 5-2 defeat.After winning three straight starts from Aug. 22 to Sept. 2, Britton seemed poised to end his rookie season with a flourish. But he lasted only five innings last week at Yankee Stadium and was far too wild against the Rays.Britton (9-10) gave up four runs, five hits and a career-high tying four walks. Only 55 of his 100 pitches were strikes."Real frustrating, because I feel like I have kind of got over that hump," the left-hander said. "It's about throwing strikes and not putting myself in tough situations by walking people. So if you eliminate those, I am fine."Matt Wieters homered for the Orioles, who find themselves in the middle of the AL wild-card chase. Tampa Bay is in hot pursuit of Boston, and Baltimore had a chance to blunt the Rays' charge.Instead, the Orioles appeared listless — in part because of Britton's struggles, according to manager Buck Showalter."Zach had 80 pitches in three innings. That makes it tough," Showalter said. "Tonight was a challenge. Deep counts to every hitter, long innings, just got back off a trip ... tonight we couldn't respond as well as we have for most of the season."B.J. Upton went 2 for 2 with two walks and set a Tampa Bay record by reaching base nine straight times before striking out in the eighth. He also broke the team mark for career walks with 375.Ben Zobrist had three hits and three RBIs for the Rays, who have won five in a row and eight of nine to move within three games of Boston for the wild card.Jeff Niemann (10-7) allowed two runs and six hits in 7 2-3 innings.

Baltimore needs to go 5-11 the rest of the way to avoid the third 100-loss season since the team moved from St. Louis in 1954.Britton should get at least a couple more starts. Showalter said the rookie has 20 innings left before being shut down for the season."It starts and stops with fastball command," Showalter said. "That's one of the reasons Tampa is doing a good job with their starters. They have guys with good command of the fastball. Zach didn't have it tonight."The Rays went up 3-0 in the third.
