It was one of those days when a fan’s yell could reach the field, and it seemed as if beer vendors were speaking into microphones.But when a concessions worker strolled up an aisle in the fifth inning and asked if anyone wanted water, it was understandable that there were no takers.Since Tuesday night, the Yankees and the Orioles had been sprayed, splashed and soaked by the seemingly unending remnants of Tropical Storm Lee. After two games in New York, they traveled to Baltimore to play a game that had been postponed Aug. 27 because of Hurricane Irene.It was hardly a welcome sight, then, when a flood warning was issued here Thursday as a result of the recent downpours. The relentless rains ended in time for the first pitch, but for the Yankees, the outlook did not brighten, as they were defeated by the Orioles, 5-4, in 10 innings.

The Yankees’ Ivan Nova, who had won eight starts in a row, received a no-decision after allowing five hits and three earned runs over five and a third innings.

That afternoon the two teams took the field at Yankee Stadium again. This time there was no delay, but there were 11 innings, 6 errors and lots of water as the Orioles splashed to a 5-4 victory.On Thursday, radar showed two thin lines of thunderstorms creeping north toward Baltimore, but one stayed a bit to the west and the other a bit to the east.Yankees Manager Joe Girardi had wanted the Orioles to schedule a doubleheader on Aug. 26 in anticipation of Hurricane Irene. But that did not happen, and the Yankees ultimately lost one of their two remaining days off.

With Nick Markakis on first in the bottom of the seventh, Vladimir Guerrero drove a double to center off Cory Wade.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) — The New York Yankees would have preferred doing just about anything on their day off rather than playing a makeup game at Camden Yards.And that was before they lost to the Baltimore Orioles 5-4 in 10 innings on Thursday.Robert Andino singled home the winning run after tying it in the eighth, giving the Orioles their second straight extra-inning win over New York.It was the fourth game in four days between the division foes. The first three were held at Yankee Stadium before both teams headed south for a makeup of an Aug. 27 contest postponed by Hurricane Irene."It's not ideal, but the Orioles had to do it, too," New York left fielder Brett Gardner said. "It's part of the game. A lot of rain, seems like the whole season."Although rain was in the forecast, the game started on time and was played without interruption. Afterward, the Yankees headed to Los Angeles and the Orioles took off for Toronto."Definitely, it's a lot of baseball in a short period of time," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said before the game. "It's one thing in April when guys are so fresh. It's another thing when it's so late."After building a 4-1 lead, New York didn't get a hit or place a runner in scoring position after the fourth inning."It's surprising we didn't and that's probably the difference in the game," Girardi said. "We lost because we didn't score any more runs."Vladimir Guerrero homered, doubled twice and scored two runs for the Orioles, who celebrated the victory by mobbing Andino at second base.In the 10th, Nolan Reimold got an infield hit off Scott Proctor (0-1) with one out and advanced on a walk. Andino then hit a grounder inside third base that got Reimold home without a throw."We can't walk people in that situation," Proctor said. "It's a good at bat (by Andino). He battled some pitches but again, you just have to execute."Clay Rapada (1-0) retired the only batter he faced in the 10th.The last-place Orioles have nothing to play for except to avoid 100 losses, but they gave the Yankees fits over the last two days."It shows a lot of heart. It shows a lot of character," Rapada said. "We're men just like they are. We want to compete and win. That's what it comes down to."New York starter Ivan Nova allowed three runs in 5 1-3 innings. The right-hander was poised to tie a Yankees single-season rookie record with his 12th straight victory (over 13 starts) before Baltimore pulled even in the eighth. Although that mark is still possible, Nova's run of eight consecutive winning starts ended.Down 4-3, the Orioles missed a chance to tie it in the seventh when Nick Markakis was thrown out at the plate trying to score from first on a one-out double by Guerrero.In the eighth, Mark Reynolds was cut down attempting to score on a single by Chris Davis, who took second on the play. Andino followed with an RBI single.Derek Jeter and Eric Chavez each had two RBIs for the Yankees, whose lead in the AL East shrunk to two games, pending Boston's game at Toronto on Thursday night."You try to win every one from here on out and put some space between us and the team behind us," Proctor said.Baltimore starter Alfredo Simon allowed four runs, six hits and a career-high six walks in four innings. Only 43 of his 88 pitches were strikes.New York went up 3-0 in the second with an uprising fueled by three walks. Chavez drove in a run with an infield hit before Jeter delivered a two-run, two-out single.Guerrero hit his 11th homer leading off the bottom half, only the fourth home run allowed by Nova in his last nine starts.Mark Teixeira led off the third with a single, Simon walked Nick Swisher with two outs and Chavez followed with an RBI single to make it 4-1.The Orioles got a run in the fourth when Guerrero doubled and scored on a groundout by Reynolds.A one-out double by Nolan Reimold chased Nova in the sixth, and Boone Logan promptly gave up an RBI double to Davis.NOTES: The Yankees will play a day-night doubleheader against Tampa Bay on Sept. 21 in New York to make up an Aug. 14 rainout, the team announced Thursday. ... Bartolo Colon (8-9) will start Friday for New York in the opener of a three-game series against the Angels, who are pressing Texas for the lead in the AL West. ... Jeremy Guthrie (6-17) will take the mound for Baltimore in Toronto on Friday, and Rick VandenHurk makes his first start of the season Saturday. ... Attendance was announced at 33,841, but that was the number of tickets sold. There were around that many empty seats in a stadium that holds 45,438.

(AP Photo/Kathy Kmonicek)MoreNEW YORK (AP) — Eduardo Nunez and the Yankees were as sloppy as the weather.Mark Reynolds hit a tiebreaking single in the 11th inning after striking out four times and the Baltimore Orioles outlasted New York 5-4 on Wednesday in another soggy game between two sleep-deprived teams."We gave them a lot of their runs today. That's the bottom line, and that's why we lost this game," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "Even when our regulars aren't in there, our defense has been pretty good. Today it wasn't. I don't know if it was the conditions. I don't know if it was fatigue. I don't know what it was, but it really cost us the game."Less than 11 hours after New York completed a rain-delayed victory, both squads were back at it.The showers returned, too, though the game started on time and was never interrupted other than when the grounds crew needed to apply diamond dust to dry a soaked infield. The stadium lights came on with rain falling again in the sixth."We don't have to worry about making up this game, and that's a good thing," Girardi said. "But physically, it's been a grind. There's no doubt about it."Nolan Reimold hit a two-run homer off A.J. Burnett and the last-place Orioles took advantage of four Yankees errors, two by Nunez as he filled in for Derek Jeter at shortstop. Both teams looked sleepy and sluggish out there — with good reason, too.With few options for a makeup date, they waited out a rain delay of 4 hours, 3 minutes on Tuesday night to play a game that ended at 2:15 a.m. Yankees players rushed home while the Orioles zipped back to their hotel to get a few precious hours of shuteye before heading back to the ballpark Wednesday morning for the 1:05 p.m. start.New York tried to extend this one even longer, putting runners at the corners with two outs in the bottom of the 11th.Pinch-hitter Eric Chavez, batting for Nunez, hit a low, sharp liner toward the middle and shortstop Robert Andino went to the ground to knock it down. He shoveled to second to nip Curtis Granderson for the final out, ending the game after 4 hours, 23 minutes."So many good things today," Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. "Robby came out there and played as good a game at shortstop as you'll ever see played in these conditions, too. I can't tell you how tough that is out there."Pedro Strop (1-1) worked 1 1-3 scoreless innings and Jim Johnson got three outs for his third save.The Orioles used eight pitchers, the Yankees six. The teams meet again in Baltimore on Thursday at 1:05 p.m. — weather permitting — for the makeup of an Aug. 27 rainout caused by Hurricane Irene."I think everybody's going to sleep well on the train," Showalter said.Burnett, given a reprieve in New York's six-man rotation after an effective start at Boston last week, allowed four runs in six-plus innings. Alex Rodriguez hit a two-run double and prized prospect Jesus Montero a two-run single off the fence in right.The AL East leaders, however, had their six-game winning streak snapped. Burnett threw three wild pitches to raise his season total to 23, by far the most in the majors."Every game it seems to be one pitch, and you get somebody going yard," he lamented. "But I kept them in it the best I could. I felt strong, but the 3-1 pitch — I can't give in right there."New York matched a season high for errors, and the last one was especially costly.Nunez couldn't handle a hot shot with one out in the 11th, allowing Matt Angle to reach safely. Angle stole second with two outs and Nick Markakis was intentionally walked before Reynolds delivered an RBI single off Hector Noesi (2-1).Coming off the late night, both managers rested several regulars, and the makeshift lineups resembled a spring training game or Triple-A matchup. Three Yankees hitters wore numbers in the 60s, and neither team looked like a big league bunch as players battled wet, windy weather in front of a sparse crowd for the second straight day.Andino's wind-blown popup in the third dropped behind the mound for a single, eluding Nunez. Burnett missed first base with his foot on a potential double play and a Bronx cheer went up when he and first baseman Brandon Laird finally converted a 3-1 putout after a couple of unsuccessful tries."Disgusting. As sloppy as it gets," Rodriguez said, referring to the Yankees' play. "You expect that with the tough conditions."NOTES: With the game tied in the late innings, Granderson, Mark Teixeira and Robinson Cano all came off the bench. ... To mark the 10-year anniversary of 9-11, the Yankees held a pregame ceremony on the field that included former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. The salute was held four days early at Yankee Stadium because the team will be in the middle of a 10-game, four-city road trip Sunday.
