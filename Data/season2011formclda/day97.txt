The Orioles didn’t acquire Reynolds for his glove, but if not for his 13 home runs since June 1, his adventures in fielding would be scrutinized much more than they have been."That part of my game has been frustrating," Reynolds said after committing error No. 20 in Monday’s loss to the Rangers. "I know it's frustrating a lot of fans, and frustrating [Orioles manager] Buck [Showalter] probably. I'm just going to go out every day in early work and keep taking grounders and try to iron this thing out."What hasn’t been frustrating is his performance at the plate in the past week. Reynolds has six home runs in his past six games, and now has the eighth-highest home run total in the majors (he still trails league leader Jose Bautista by eight, though). My Baltimore Sun colleague Kevin Cowherd speculated that Reynolds is having fun out there, but on Monday, Reynolds sounded like a man who, like you, is sick of the Orioles’ losses, too. var adSkipCounter = 0; "Yeah, it's been nice,” Reynolds said of his recent hot streak. “But what's our record in the six games? It's not very good. You know, I was in the playoffs in '07 and there's nothing like it. I want to be part of a team again that gets back there and gets to play for that ring."That is not likely to happen this season, but 40 home runs would be a decent consolation prize, especially given his slow start. Him committing 40 errors isn’t out of the realm of possibilities, either.Your turn: Will Reynolds finish with more homers or errors?     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: 'thumbnails-f',     container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives',     placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives',     target_type: 'mix'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed'Blushing' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn't to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.
