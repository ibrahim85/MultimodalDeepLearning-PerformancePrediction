He will join last year’s top picks by the Pirates, Jameson Taillon and Stetson Allie, in what looks to be a potentially dominant crop of young pitchers who could soon join Charlie Morton, an emerging star, in Pittsburgh’s rotation.Cole was told of the pick about 30 minutes before the draft but kept the news to himself.“I actually didn’t tell my family because I wanted to keep them in suspense a little bit,” he said on a conference call, “but obviously, it’s one of the most memorable phone calls I’ll ever receive.”In 2009, the Pirates were thought by some to be taking an inferior player in order to save money when they drafted catcher Tony Sanchez No. 4 over all. Pittsburgh subsequently gave him just a $2.5 million bonus. Photo       The Royals' pick Bubba Starling may play college football.  Credit             Orlin Wagner/Associated Press           Last year, the Pirates turned that around and took Taillon with the No. 2 overall pick and gave him $6.5 million, the largest bonus in franchise history. In the second round, they selected Allie, signing him to a $2.25 million bonus that was the most the team had paid for a player outside the first round. Pirates General Manager Neal Huntington credited the team’s owner, Robert Nutting, with being willing to spend money on draft picks. “He’s allowing us to build it the right way,” Huntington said on a conference call, “and we owe him our appreciation.” Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      This was the fourth time in the draft era that the Pirates have had the first overall pick, previously selecting Bryan Bullington in 2002, Kris Benson in 1996 and Jeff King in 1986. Bullington and Benson were busts, with Benson compiling a 43-49 record for Pittsburgh before being traded and Bullington going 0-3 in two seasons before being waived.

Credit             Andrew Shurtleff/FR 82550 AP, via Associated Press           It was the first time that pitchers were taken with each of the first four picks. Over all, 19 pitchers and 14 position players were drafted in the first round. Nineteen of the 33 first-rounders were selected out of college.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Starling, an 18-year-old outfielder from Gardner-Edgerton High School in Gardner, Kan., was one of the most intriguing players in the draft.A star quarterback and outfielder, Starling has committed to playing quarterback for Nebraska next season. That, combined with Scott Boras’s being his representative, has led many to think that he will be a difficult player to sign, possibly looking for money on the level of the recent top picks Bryce Harper and Stephen Strasburg.Evoking memories of Bo Jackson, who made his debut for the Royals 25 years ago, Starling is a 6-foot-4 power hitter with blazing speed (a reported 4.36-second 40-yard dash). But he has yet to make up his mind about which sport he is going to pursue.Starling’s high school baseball coach, Jerald VanRheem, would not speculate where he thought Starling, who hit .481 in his senior season, would end up, but said by e-mail, “He will make the best decision for him and his family.” Photo       Trevor Bauer, Cole's teammate, was picked by Arizona.  Credit             Nati Harnik/Associated Press           The drafting of Cole had to come as a blow to the Yankees, who selected him out of high school with the 28th pick in the 2008 draft but were unable to sign him when he chose to go to college. They had planned on offering him a large bonus, but Cole chose not to negotiate with them.

That was one of 9 compensation picks and 10 over all that the Rays had among the 60 picks on the first day of the draft.

Rendon, a third baseman from Rice, was primarily a designated hitter this season because of a shoulder injury. His home run total fell from 26 as a sophomore to 6 this year.The draft will continue Tuesday with Rounds 2-30, and Wednesday with Rounds 31-50.
