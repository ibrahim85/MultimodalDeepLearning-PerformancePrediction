Then you would remember that this idea has been taken, and instead you would invent the tale of the longest professional game ever played. You would make it a minor league contest, featuring players with mostly faint hopes of getting to the majors; they would absurdly play into the wee hours with no scouts in sight in April’s irrelevant cold. Therefore — and here’s your grand novelistic gesture — they must be persevering for some purpose larger than themselves. It would take place on Easter, the day the dead are reborn, in a decaying Northeastern mill town peopled by working-class Catholics who believe that unimportant things like wafers, wine and baseball can be made holy through faith. If you wished to be really obvious, the game would last 33 innings — one for each of Jesus’ years on earth.Dan Barry, a national columnist for The New York Times, has written this exact novel — except it all really happened. On April 18-19, 1981, the Rochester Red Wings and the Pawtucket Red Sox of the International League — the top farm clubs of the Baltimore Orioles and the Boston Red Sox (teams that would eventually call up the evening’s two starting third basemen, Cal Ripken Jr. and Wade Boggs) — played for 32 innings, tied at 1-1 through 9 and at 2-2 through 21, in Pawtucket, R.I., until 4 a.m., Easter Sunday. (They played the decisive 33rd inning two months later.) Photo        Credit             Photograph Courtesy of The Pawtucket Red Sox           The improbable web of coincidences that made this event possible — most amazingly, the 1981 International League manual inexplicably lacked every other edition’s 12:50 a.m. curfew — becomes credible once you have witnessed the scope of Barry’s reporting. He seems to have talked to every­body: players; Pawtucket’s manager, who was ejected in the 22nd inning after arguing a call, and became a spectator; Rochester’s general manager/announcer; some of the 20 or so fans who stuck it out; a college kid outside Rochester who lay awake listening to the game; a player’s wife; the home-plate umpire; the scorekeeper; the clubhouse attendant.At his best, Barry is an uncle spinning a story by the fire, halting each time a new character enters the narrative to offer a biographical sketch or a telling anecdote. A fifth-inning pop-up prompts a 10-page digression about Boggs and the Pawtucket first baseman, Dave Koza, that is far more memorable than the pop-up’s fate. One ecstatic paragraph lists the 20 starting players’ hometowns, from Brooklyn and Chicago to Uvalde, Tex., and San Cristóbal in the Dominican Republic. But then Barry calls his Whitmanesque catalog “a ballad of bus fumes and ambition,” and indeed, there is too much purple prose and too many clichés. Fortunately, the actual material easily compensates.More than an Easter play, Barry’s pageant resembles a Seder (yes, of course, the game also took place on the first night of Passover). During Seder, Jews are instructed to imagine they themselves were present when Moses freed the slaves — much as the reader is supposed to fancy that he himself shivered in the stands. And like the Seder and its message of freedom, Barry’s heroic conjuring of the past is most persuasive when it honors values that, despite the holiness of the day, do not depend on the sacred. “Why did you keep playing? Why did you stay?” Barry rhetorically asks the players and fans. His reporting has led him to this answer: “Because we are bound by duty. Because we aspire to greater things. Because we are loyal.”Miracles can retain their mystery even after they are explained. “The moon is nearly full,” Barry notes at one point. “Make of this what you will.” BOTTOM OF THE 33RD Hope, Redemption, and Baseball’s Longest Game By Dan Barry Illustrated. 255 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $26.99.

3 View photosBaltimore Orioles' Brandon Snyder grimaces after he was hit by a pitch during the ninth inning of a baseball game against the New York Yankees, Thursday, May 19, 2011, in Baltimore. The Yankees won 13-2. MoreBy the time the Baltimore Orioles were ready for their first crack at CC Sabathia, they were already too far behind to make a game of it.Brad Bergesen gave up five runs to the New York Yankees in the first inning, and the Orioles went quietly in a 13-2 loss Thursday night.Coming off a shutout of the Tampa Bay Rays, Bergesen struggled from the outset. The Yankees took a 2-0 lead after only three batters came to the plate, and Nick Swisher added a three-run double before Bergesen got the third out."For me, it was everything tonight. Just all around, just bad," Bergesen said. "Putting us in a 5-0 hole just made it real tough for us tonight. Just nothing good for me tonight, whatsoever."Bergesen (1-5) allowed eight runs and five hits in 3 1-3 innings. He's 0-4 with a 9.25 ERA in five career starts against New York.Despite his lack of success against New York, his dud of a performance was somewhat surprising after what he did against Tampa Bay only five nights earlier."You'd like to see him take his last outing and run with it. You expect and you're hoping that's the case," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "I've seen him pitch some good games while I've been here for a short time, and I've seen him really struggle. Most of them are the result of his command of his fastball. He wasn't good enough. He knows that."Sabathia (4-3) scattered seven hits over eight shutout innings, striking out nine and walking none. The left-hander is 2-0 against the Orioles this season, 16-2 lifetime and 10-1 at Camden Yards.Mark Teixeira and Eduardo Nunez homered for the Yankees, whose 14 hits included three doubles, three triples and two home runs.Swisher drove in four runs and Jorge Posada, starting at first base for the first time since 2008, walked twice and had a run-scoring double.New York completed a two-game sweep and improved to 6-0 against Baltimore."We got the quick five runs," manager Joe Girardi noted. "We needed to give the bullpen the night off — and that's what CC did for us."Amaury Sanit gave up two runs in the ninth, on an RBI double by Mark Reynolds and a run-scoring groundout by Jake Fox.The game was all but decided in the first inning. After Derek Jeter led off with a double and scored on a triple by Curtis Granderson, Teixeira hit a run-scoring groundout. Two outs later, Bergesen hit Robinson Cano with a pitch above the knee, and Cano wore a look of disgust as he walked to first base.It was the second time in two innings that a Baltimore pitcher plunked a Yankees batter. In the 15th inning Wednesday night, Chris Dickerson was struck in the head by a fastball from Mike Gonzalez.After hitting Cano, Bergesen issued two straight walks before Swisher cleared the bases with a liner that left fielder Felix Pie got a glove on but couldn't hold.In the bottom half, Sabathia got two quick outs before hitting Nick Markakis in the back with a pitch. Home plate umpire Larry Vanover promptly warned both sides that the next pitcher to throw at a batter would be ejected."It just got away from me — a fastball that got away," Sabathia said. "I always pitch him in. That's one of those things."Vladimir Guerrero followed with a single to put runners on the corners, but Sabathia got Adam Jones to hit into a fielder's choice.New York used a four-run fourth to make it 9-0. Swisher walked before Brett Gardner and Jeter hit successive triples to chase Bergesen. One out later, Teixeira hit a towering two-run homer off Chris Jakubauskas.Nunez homered for the first time this season in the ninth with a man on against Troy Patton.NOTES: The start of the game was delayed by rain for 48 minutes. ... Dickerson was rested Thursday but hoped to play Friday against the Mets. He had a headache and said a CT scan revealed a concussion. ... Jakubauskas and Patton were recalled from Triple-A Norfolk before the game. The moves coincided with Derrek Lee (oblique) and Brian Roberts (concussion) being placed on the DL. After the game, the Orioles optioned Jakubauskas to Norfolk. ... Cano has an 18-game hitting streak against Baltimore.
