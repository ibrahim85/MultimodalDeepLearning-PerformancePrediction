Their permanence is why, decades later, Jim Palmer will gently correct a visitor to his broadcast booth who misstates the number of times he won 20 games. It happened eight times, Palmer said, not seven, and of course, he is right. It is all there in neat lines of type on baseball cards and Web sites.Palmer was at Comerica Park to call the Baltimore Orioles’ game against the Detroit Tigers, champions of the American League Central. The Tigers are trying to secure home-field advantage for their division series, but the story was their ace, Justin Verlander, and his quest for a memorable statistic.Twenty-five and five. With a win Saturday, that would have been Verlander’s 2011 record. Others have been better — think Ron Guidry, 1978 — but only one pitcher has ever been precisely 25-5: Sandy Koufax in 1963. That season ended with Koufax leaping off the mound after his Los Angeles Dodgers swept the World Series.Verlander could not do it. He allowed five runs in seven innings and had no decision in a 6-5 loss. The rookie Matt Angle, who was hitting .174, led off with his first career homer, and drew a two-out walk in the second to set up a three-run rally.

There was nothing to concern him for the playoffs.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “It’s just kind of a case of being little bit out of sync early, not executing my pitches, a little bit up in the zone,” Verlander said. “Easy fixes.”Verlander allowed eight hits and a walk, striking out six to push his league-leading total to 250. He kept his A.L. lead in earned run average (2.40), one point better than Jered Weaver of the Angels.Weaver could make one more start, but Verlander’s next outing will be Game 1 of the division series on Friday, possibly against the Yankees. Everything resets now.

He won his next 12 starts after that loss, matching the longest streak since Ellis Kinder of the Boston Red Sox won 13 straight in 1949. The last pitcher to win 12 consecutive starts before Verlander was Johan Santana in 2004. Photo       Justin Verlander in his final regular-season start got a no-decision to finish 24-5.  Credit             Jeff Kowalsky/Reuters           “He’s plus all the way across the board,” Palmer said of Verlander. “Command’s plus, athleticism is plus, curveball’s plus, changeup’s plus, two-seamer’s plus, four-seamer’s plus. There’s some guys who are close to that, but it’s a perfect storm for a hitter.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Winning 25 is rare in these days of the five-man rotation. The last pitcher to win 25 was Bob Welch of Oakland, who was 27-6 in 1990. Before Welch was Steve Stone, an Orioles teammate of Palmer, who went 25-7 in 1980.Welch and Stone won the A.L. Cy Young Award, but neither approached 20 victories in any other season. This was Verlander’s first season with 20, but it may not be his last. He is 28 years old, and driven.

Privacy Policy    “He took February and March as if it was April,” Brad Penny, the veteran Tigers starter, said. “He told me that he had had slow Aprils for most of his career, and what I saw in spring training is what he’s been doing throughout the whole season. I honestly can’t tell you one or two times that his stuff’s been different. It’s always been dominating stuff — all of his pitches are as good as he throws them. He’s consistently better than anyone I’ve ever played with.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Penny has played with Josh Beckett, Tim Lincecum, Chris Carpenter and Adam Wainwright, among others.On Saturday, Palmer chatted about Verlander with Al Kaline, the Tigers Hall of Famer. They compared him to J.R. Richard and Nolan Ryan, right-handers who defined power pitching in the 1970s. As great as Ryan was, Palmer said, Verlander is better, because of his changeup and control of the running game.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Verlander was the A.L. Rookie of the Year for the Tigers’ World Series team in 2006. In three of his next four seasons, he earned at least 18 victories. This season, he jumped from an ace to a possible A.L. Most Valuable Player. Starting with his no-hitter on May 7 in Toronto, Verlander was 22-2.“You don’t ever set expectations, goals; you never know what can happen,” Verlander said. “This is what I’ve always envisioned.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  At his best, Verlander keeps most fastballs at 92 to 94 miles an hour, saving the harder stuff for when he most needs a strikeout: say, runner on third, less than two out. The goal is to induce weak contact and keep a low pitch count, so he can stay strong late.His fastest pitch Saturday came in his final inning: 100 m.p.h. on a foul ball by J.J. Hardy, who made the final out of Verlander’s first no-hitter, in 2007. Hardy found more success Saturday, with a two-run single after Angle’s walk that helped spoil Verlander’s night.But all that really happened is that Verlander now knows his final record for a magical regular season: 24-5. It does not have the ring of 25-5, but the most important games are still to come.

Hopefully I’ve got another five or six starts ahead of me.”  A version of this article appears in print on September 25, 2011, on Page SP4 of the New York edition with the headline: It Still Adds Up to a Magical Season.

(AP Photo/Duane Burleson)MoreDETROIT (AP) — Alfredo Simon thought he had made a perfect pitch to Miguel Cabrera.More than 400 feet later, he was starting to wonder.In the first inning Friday night Simon threw a fastball in on Cabrera's hands and was amazed when it ended up deep in the stands in left field."I had just thrown a breaking ball for a strike, so I wanted to come inside with a fastball," Simon said. "I put it right where I wanted it, and he still hit it that far. I don't know how he even hit the ball, much less hit it like that. I guess that's why he's the best hitter in baseball."The homer was the only major mistake Simon made, but he was done for the night when the Tigers beat the Orioles 4-3 in 11 innings.Simon pitched eight innings, allowing three runs and six hits."This game speaks very well for Alfredo, because he did this against a great lineup," Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. "I just need to see him do it on a more consistent basis."Baltimore's offense couldn't do enough to win the game. After scoring three runs in the first three innings, the Orioles didn't score again."We did some early damage off (Rick) Porcello, but then nothing," Showalter said. "He settled down, and that team has a lot of weapons in its bullpen."Brandon Inge started the 11th inning with a walk off Willie Eyre (2-2), and Cabrera hit a one-out single. Rookie Zach Phillips came on to face Victor Martinez and gave up a game-ending double on his third pitch."That's why they pay Miguel and Victor the big bucks," Showalter said. "We had them both 0-2, and couldn't put them away, but they've made a living hitting pitches that weren't in the strike zone."Porcello allowed three runs, nine hits and a walk in seven innings. Ryan Perry (1-0) got the win with a scoreless 11th.Detroit tied the game at 3 in the fifth when Jhonny Peralta led off with a double and scored on Ramon Santiago's second single of the game.The Tigers threatened in the ninth. Cabrera singled off Jim Johnson with one out. After a groundout moved Cabrera to second, Alex Avila was intentionally walked. Johnson got Peralta on a called third strike to send the game to extra innings.The Orioles took a 1-0 lead in the first on Vladimir Guerrero's RBI double, but the Tigers came back in the bottom of the inning on Cabrera's 27th long homer.Cabrera became the first Tiger since 1961 to reach triple figures in runs, RBIs and walks, but Tigers manager Jim Leyland wasn't about to get drawn into the MVP race that includes him and Justin Verlander."I don't want a boxing match between him and Verlander in the next couple days," he said. "Cabrera's terrific. He's a star. There is absolutely no question about that."Baltimore got two runs in the third. Robert Andino and J.J. Hardy led off the inning with infield singles and moved up on a wild pitch. Nick Markakis tied the game with a sacrifice fly, and Matt Wieters put the Orioles ahead with an RBI single.NOTES: The four-game series continues Saturday night with Verlander (24-5) going for his 13th straight win in his final regular-season start against Baltimore's Jeremy Guthrie (9-17). ... Leyland said before the game that, while he will not start Verlander on short rest in a first-round series, he might consider it in the ALCS or World Series. ... Tigers 3B Wilson Betemit (knee) was originally scheduled to start on Friday, but Leyland decided against it because of the cold, damp conditions. ... Detroit's Joaquin Benoit hasn't allowed a run in his last 20 appearances, spanning 20 2-3 innings. ... Cabrera widened his gap over Martinez in their friendly RBI race. His two-run homer gave him 100 on the season, while Martinez's game-winning hit put him at 98. 
6  The Orioles notched their 67th victory tonight, one more than last year's total, in a game that was bookended by unlikely events involving Matt Angle. He opened up the top of the first inning with a leadoff home run off of Cy Young contender Justin Verlander. The home run was the first of Angle's career. Not bad for a rookie getting his first taste of the big leagues. The O's jumped out to a 5-0 lead but it came back to be tied and it was in the top of the 9th where Angle was again involved. Speedster Kyle Hudson worked his way from first to third on a single wild pitch and then came the suicide squeeze. Hudson took off on a pitch, Angle dropped the bunt where it needed to be and the run scored, making it 6-5 Orioles. This was the final score. It wasn't the best of nights for Verlander, who entered with a 2.29 ERA and left with a 2.40 ERA. That reflects the five runs he gave up over seven innings. The damage all came for him in the first three innings. Angle lead off with the homer and the Orioles nickel-and-dimed Verlander for three runs off of four singles and a walk in the second inning. The walk was issued to Angle. Verlander wanted no part of the powerhouse after the home run. Mark Reynolds delivered another of the promised home runs, his 37th of the year, and after that Verlander shut them down, retiring twelve Orioles in a row at one point. Still, the damage was done. Staked to the lead of five runs, Jeremy Guthrie did not have his best start, but it was still enough. First he gave up a leadoff walk to Ryan Raburn (.291 OBP) in the 4th. Raburn eventually scored on an Austin Jackson single. A couple of sharp hits to start the 5th by Miguel Cabrera (single) and Victor Martinez (ground rule double) gave Detroit second and third with one down. An RBI groundout followed by an RBI sac fly gave the Tigers two runs but ended the threat. He gave up a solo home run to Miguel Cabrera, which was the best-hit ball off of him of the night. That was all over six innings. Not the best Guthrie start, but not the worst. Barring something unusual it's his final appearance of the year. He will close the book with a 4.33 ERA over 211 innings. Because it was Guthrie, of course he could not get the win when he left with a one-run lead.    The Honey Badger, Pedro Strop, came on in relief after Guthrie allowed a single to start the 7th, but three ground balls later and that threat was over. Buck left Strop out for a second inning. Strop got the first two outs but a runner made it to second base in the process. That meant there was a man in scoring position for Jhonny Peralta, who brought in the tying run with a single to left. Guthrie was stuck with a no-decision. The run was the first one allowed by Strop since coming to the O's. He's now thrown 10.2 IP with just the one earned run. A much more palatable ratio than someone like Kevin Gregg. Speaking of Gregg, he pitched the 9th inning. This was frustrating, but he did not suck tonight. He did not walk anyone and only gave up one base hit. The tying run never even made it into scoring position. The save was the 22nd of the year for Gregg. Let's not talk about the blown saves. We're just lucky to get this win. The O's had ten hits on the night, with multi-hit games from Nick Markakis and Chris Davis. Vladimir Guerrero had a base hit in the first inning to get his little tie with Julio Franco for the all-time hits lead for a player from the Dominican Republic. With one more hit he will have the sole lead. That will be 2,586 career hits, the 81st most on baseball's career list. He did not get on base again.    Fortunately for the Tigers, they will get to feast on Brian Matusz in tomorrow afternoon's game. They're sending out their weakest pitcher in Brad Penny, but it doesn't matter. Anyone is better than Matusz at this point. They will have a chance to get back the game they lost to Texas. Who would have ever thought we'd end this year with more wins than last year? Does it mean anything? Probably not. Too many things have gone wrong to feel too good. But enough has gone better than it looked that we can feel at least a tiny bit good. In a lost cause there can still be some glory - and Matt Angle being the star of the show against Verlander is why it's still fun to watch meaningless September baseball games.
