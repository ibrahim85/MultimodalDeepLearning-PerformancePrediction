No one is looking out for the greater good of the game. No one is guiding the sport toward long-term prosperity and short-term sensibility. No one is building consensus and channeling all of the ratings, financial success and popularity toward an outcome that is positive for everyone in the sport.And with the conference plate tectonics poised to shift with Texas A&M’s possible move to the Southeastern Conference, the college sports world finds itself, yet again, panicking about a major paradigm change.Imagine if the Kansas City Chiefs could cause upheaval in the N.F.L. or the Baltimore Orioles could force a major realignment in Major League Baseball. That is the situation college football appeared to find itself in Friday, just hours after Mark Emmert, the president of the N.C.A.A., proclaimed that the university presidents, not the conference commissioners, were calling the shots in college athletics.Will the great conference land rush that nearly happened in 2010 come to fruition in 2011? No one is sure. But the relative calm of the past nine months ended on Friday, with Texas A&M finally finding national relevance by preparing to sprint out of the Big 12 like a kindergartner whose lunch money was taken. That means the SEC will probably search for another team —  Virginia Tech? Florida State? Clemson? — and the Big 12, the Big East and the Atlantic Coast Conference will be circling the wagons and reaching for the antacid. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The same forces that drove expansion in 2010 —  ego and money —  have re-emerged this summer. Only in this era of college sports could a university like Texas A&M prompt potential seismic changes in the landscape. Consider that the Aggies’ last Big 12 title in football was in 1998 and their lone bowl victory since 1995 came in the Galleryfurniture.com Bowl. But as they walk the plank to be devoured in the SEC — hello, Louisiana State, Alabama and Auburn — at least Texas A&M’s leaders can revel in having the college sports world breathlessly follow them for a few days in August.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  If, as expected, the Texas A&M System board of regents approves the move Monday, it will be the first step in what numerous longtime observers of college sports view as a calculated money grab by the SEC commissioner, Mike Slive. With the Big Ten and the Pacific-12 having moved ahead of the SEC in terms of television revenue, Slive’s move to take Texas A&M, and inevitably another university, will allow the league to close the financial gap. By adding two teams, Slive should get the league significantly more money in a renegotiation with ESPN, though the network’s lack of competition during the negotiations will limit Slive’s leverage and prevent a blockbuster.That leaves the Big 12 reeling once again. Its athletic directors and presidents have resolved to keep the league together, but it is hard to imagine a league with Texas, Oklahoma and a group of football also-rans thriving and demanding huge television contracts.Give credit to Oklahoma’s athletic director, Joe Castiglione, who shunned the prospect of more money from the SEC on the basis of principle and common sense. The principle — ignored by Texas A&M — stems from the agreements made last year between the remaining Big 12 teams after Colorado left for the Pac-12 and Nebraska bolted for the Big Ten. The common sense comes from knowing that the Big 12 still offers the most realistic path to the Bowl Championship Series title game.

Privacy Policy    The new incarnation of the Big 12 unraveled quickly, awkwardly and publicly in 2011. The divisive issue was Texas’ new television channel, the Longhorn Network, which drove a wedge between the Longhorns and the rest of the league before showing a minute of programming. (In what could be a summation of the current landscape of college athletics, ESPN created the Longhorn Network, which helped force Texas A&M to leave the Big 12, and now ESPN will probably have to pay the SEC millions more because the league is adding Texas A&M.)  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Texas A&M’s departure from the Big 12 would dull some of the cattiness in a league in which unequal revenue sharing has always been an issue. The league will need to decide whether it wants to fortify by adding one team or three, with Brigham Young, Louisville and Houston as potential targets.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Big Ten and the Pac-12, which both have stability and financial security, do not appear likely to respond to the SEC’s move. Still, it is hard not to see this shift by Texas A&M as part of the creep toward four 16-team superconferences that so many around college sports see as inevitable.The A.C.C. is nervous that Slive will snatch a marquee university, even with the understanding among SEC presidents that the league would not add a university from a state that already includes an SEC team — which would seem to rule out Florida State. The Big East, which still bears the scars from the departures of Miami, Virginia Tech and Boston College, is nervous that the A.C.C. will respond by raiding it again.While the SEC flexes its muscles and Texas A&M enjoys its stroll on the college sports catwalk, the entire enterprise of college sports has been shaken.Once again, tradition and common sense have given way to television money and ego.Once again, any incremental progress the N.C.A.A. attempts to make in regards to reform is overshadowed.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  And once again, it is painfully obvious that no one is looking out for what is best for all of college sports. And for all of college football’s success and prosperity, that has many people wondering whether the sport is really headed in the right direction.    A version of this news analysis appears in print on August 14, 2011, on Page SP9 of the New York edition with the headline: The Only Thing That Rules College Football Is Anarchy.

Friday, Aug. 12, 2011, in Baltimore. Reimold scored on the hit. (AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) — More often than not, the middle of the Detroit Tigers' lineup will handle the brunt of the offense.Sometimes, though, the Tigers will have to depend on the other guys to produce the hits and runs necessary to win.Such was the case against the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night, when Wilson Betemit homered and rookie Andy Dirks had a career-high four hits in a 5-4 victory.Betemit, the No. 9 hitter, had three hits. Dirks went 4 for 4 with a walk and singled in the tiebreaking run in the sixth inning."That's what a club needs to win games," manager Jim Leyland said. "It's nice when you get contributions from everybody. In the end, the big bats are going to carry you, but it's always nice when some other guys chip in."Acquired in a July 20 trade with Kansas City, Betemit had three hits and is 9 for 17 in his last five games. Since the trade, he's batting .347 with two homers, three doubles and 10 RBIs.Dirks, meanwhile, finds himself in the pennant race after spending last season with Double-A Erie and Triple-A Toledo."Once you get out on the field you don't feel like a rookie," he said. "You're just like any other player and you do what you can to help the team win."Alex Avila had two hits and scored twice to help the first-place Tigers maintain their three-game lead over Cleveland in the AL Central."It's a team game and everybody has to contribute and do their part," Dirks said. "That's what makes a good ballclub. You can't count on just a few guys to carry you every night."Detroit received 3 2-3 innings of one-hit relief from a stellar bullpen that has an 0.84 ERA over the last eight games.J.J. Hardy hit two homers, but his third multihomer game of the season was not enough to prevent Baltimore from losing for the eighth time in 10 games. Hardy has 23 homers this season, three short of matching his career high."I think we battled," Hardy said. "They just came out on top."Detroit went up 5-4 in the sixth. Austin Jackson hit a leadoff double off Troy Patton (0-1) and Dirks followed with an RBI single.Jackson helped preserve the lead with a leaping catch at the top of the center-field wall on a drive by Adam Jones.Brad Penny (8-9) allowed four runs and seven hits in 5 1-3 innings to snap a personal three-game losing streak."I didn't have the command I normally have," Penny said. "We won, and that's all I care about."Jose Valverde, the last of three Detroit relievers, worked the ninth for his 34th save in 34 tries.Orioles starter Alfredo Simon gave up four runs, 11 hits and three walks in 4 2-3 innings. He has yielded 21 hits in his last two outings.Betemit's fifth homer of the season, after Avila led off the fourth with a single, put Detroit ahead 4-2. The Tigers could have had more, but right fielder Nick Markakis threw out Jackson trying to score on a fly ball and first baseman Chris Davis made a diving snag of a two-out grounder by Victor Martinez with two runners on.Hardy hit his second homer of the game in the fifth, Jones doubled and Vladimir Guerrero broke a 1-for-24 slump with an RBI single to tie it at 4.That, however, would be Baltimore's final run.Miguel Cabrera put Detroit up 1-0 in the first with an RBI single, but Simon got Jhonny Peralta to hit into an inning-ended double play with the bases loaded.Orioles manager Buck Showalter shook up the lineup in an effort to get more production from an offense held under four runs in seven of its previous 11 games. Nolan Reimold batted leadoff and Guerrero was dropped a notch from the cleanup spot for the first time this season. Reimold became the sixth different player to bat atop the order, including Brian Roberts, who hasn't played since May 16 because of a concussion.Showalter's hunch was promptly rewarded. Reimold drew a first-inning walk and Hardy followed with a drive to left for a 2-1 lead.A sacrifice fly by Jackson tied it in the second.NOTES: Tigers reliever Al Alburquerque received a concussion when struck by a ball during batting practice. He was placed on the 7-day concussion DL after the game. ... Magglio Ordonez snapped an 0-for-14 skid with a first-inning single, and in the bottom half Mark Reynolds singled to end his 0-for-17 slide. ... Detroit will send Max Scherzer (11-7) to the mound Saturday night against the Orioles, who will counter with Jeremy Guthrie (5-15). Scherzer is one win short of matching his career high, and Guthrie is 3-1 with a 2.62 ERA in five lifetime starts against the Tigers. ... Orioles RHP Jake Arrieta had successful surgery Friday to remove a bone spur from his right elbow.

"They were great examples for me every day on how to play the game the right way. The Orioles have established a great tradition here. When I took the field in Baltimore, I tried to copy that great tradition and follow the Oriole way every day." var adSkipCounter = 0; Bordick has the third highest fielding percentage (.982) among shortstops with at least 1,000 games played in Major League history, and in 2002, he had the best defensive season for a shortstop in Major League history, setting a record for highest fielding percentage (.998), fewest errors (one) and consecutive errorless games (110).Bordick, 46, is now in his second season coaching in the Orioles organization as coordinator of offensive fundamentals. Most recently he has served as the team's bullpen coach."I've been such a fan of Bordy as a player. A lot of times you get to deal with a guy one-on-one, and you have a perception of him and you get your bubble burst. He's better than I thought he was and I know exactly why he's had the success that he did," said Orioles manager Buck Showalter. "I love him. I think he's special, I think he's got a bright future. I think he's going to be a star at coaching, managing, anything that he wants to do."Long-time head athletic trainer Richie Bancells was also honored as the17th recipient of the Herb Armstrong Award, given to non-uniformed personnel who have made significant contributions to the ballclub and the game of baseball.Bancells is in his 24th seasons as the Orioles' head athletic trainer, his 28th year with the big league club and his 35th in the organization."When I look at the past Herb Armstrong award winners, this is a group of people that I've worked with and admired," Bancells said.NOTES: Triple-A Norfolk left-hander Brian Matusz remains likely to be promoted to start Tuesday in Oakland. … Starter Zach Britton (left shoulder strain) will pitch for Single-A Frederick on either Monday or Tuesday, and is tentatively scheduled to be activated from the disabled list and pitch Saturday or Sunday in Anaheim, Calif. … Minor league infield coordinator Bobby Dickerson will take over bullpen coaching duties from Bordick during the West Coast trip … Third baseman Mark Reynolds, who started 115 of the Orioles' first 116 games, was not in the starting Saturday. … Detroit Tigers reliever Al Alburquerque, who was hit in the side of the head by a Robert Andino liner during batting practice Friday, was released Saturday from University of Maryland Hospital after being diagnosed with a concussion.
