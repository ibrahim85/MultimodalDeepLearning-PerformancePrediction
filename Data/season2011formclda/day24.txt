An exasperating, exhilarating final two and a half innings followed, and after a series of dramatic moments and a 40-minute rain delay, the ending to the Yankees’ 6-3 victory proved rather anticlimactic.After a brilliant catch by Brett Gardner preserved a one-run lead in the eighth, after Mariano Rivera blew his second consecutive save opportunity and after the teams traded outs on close plays at the plate, the Yankees scored all three runs in the top of the 11th inning on infield singles, a rally aided by two throwing errors and an unplanned steal of third base by Robinson Cano.“One crazy game,” said Russell Martin, who drove in the first run in the 11th.All that it lacked perhaps was the emotional charge of Saturday, when Martin was drilled in the back with what may or may not have been a purpose pitch. There was no retaliation by the Yankees on Sunday, just madness that ended 4 hours 25 minutes after Derek Jeter lashed the first of his four hits, after Boone Logan pitched on both sides of a 40-minute rain delay and when Buddy Carlyle emerged from a short-handed bullpen to record the final two outs and secure a 3-1 trip.Separating the Yankees from perfection was an implosion Tuesday night in Toronto by Rivera. For him, one blown save is rare enough. Two in a row, nearly unheard of, unseen, in fact, since April 15-20, 2007, according to Baseball-Reference.com.

The setup man Rafael Soriano was unavailable with a stiff back, which muddled the Yankees’ relief plans. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Their bullpen issues actually began in the seventh, when Freddy Garcia was lifted after supplying six scoreless innings for a second straight start. He threw 90 pitches — six more than he did last Saturday, when he stifled Texas — and Girardi called on Joba Chamberlain, who gave up a two-run homer to Mark Reynolds.

On Sunday, with the outfield playing him to pull and Gardner standing in shallow left, Scott reached out to poke a slicing liner that looked as if it would carry over his head. Sprinting back, Gardner sensed that the ball hung a little longer than he initially thought. He took a small jump and, with his glove outstretched, snagged the ball a few steps in front of the warning track. “I knew it was trouble,” Gardner said. “I still think it was trouble.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  His catch saved at least one run, and probably two. And when he crossed the third-base line on his way to the dugout, he found several teammates waiting to congratulate him, including Rivera, who thumped his glove and simply said, “Great play.” [{"headline":"Sports","summary":"Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, delivered to your inbox every week.","product-code":"SP","product-title":"Sports","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/sports?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=SP&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Race\/Related Newsletter","summary":"Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with New York Times journalists.","product-code":"RR","product-title":"Race Related","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/race-related?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=RR&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Your Money","summary":"Every week, get tips on retirement, paying for college, credit cards and the right way to invest.","product-code":"MY","product-title":"Your Money","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/your-money?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=business&contentId=MY&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"}]      Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Privacy Policy    Gardner could not assist him in the ninth, when with two on and two out, Brian Roberts grounded a two-out double just inside the first-base line that drove in Adam Jones with the tying run, with pinch-runner Robert Andino right behind him. A strong one-hop relay from Cano bounced a little up the line, but Martin lunged to grab it, then swiped his glove across the plate to tag Andino’s left foot and thwart the winning run. “If his front leg wasn’t down, he would have scored,” Martin said.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  An equally close play saved the Orioles in the 10th, when Jeter tried scoring on a fly ball to medium-depth center. Jones whipped a throw home that Matt Wieters caught above his head and, while blocking the plate with his right leg, nabbed Jeter for the double play.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “I was out,” said Jeter, who surpassed Frank Robinson on the career hit list (2,945), raising his average to .257. “He got me. It looked like he was going to jump, and I thought I could maybe get under it.”Cano had a similarly honest reaction when asked about his daring base-running exploits in the 11th, when he nearly committed the cardinal baseball sin of being the first out at third. After hitting a leadoff double, Cano took a sizable lead off second, but his right foot caught in the dirt and Wieters fired to second, trying to throw behind him. Cano reacted instantly. He broke for third, sliding in before the throw from Andino, and scored what proved to be the winning run on Martin’s grounder to deep short.“That was real quick,” Cano said, smiling. “I didn’t plan anything.”  A version of this article appears in print on April 25, 2011, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: In Eventful Day, Yankees’ Offense Does Just Enough for the Victory.

PETERSBURG, Fla. — The most dangerous fastball hitter in baseball came to the plate as the go-ahead run with two outs in the ninth inning last Tuesday at Tropicana Field. Paul Konerko of the Chicago White Sox fouled off four pitches from the Tampa Bay Rays’ James Shields, who commanded his repertory all night.On the fifth pitch, Shields unleashed a fastball, up and in at 93 miles an hour, and Konerko swung and missed to end the game. It was another loss for the struggling White Sox, who start a four-game series at Yankee Stadium on Monday, and Konerko, the team captain, succinctly distilled his failure.“I got good pitches to hit and took good swings, but when you foul it back and you just miss a ball, that’s the sign of that slight hesitation because a guy can do so much,” Konerko said. “That’s what was happening tonight. Pitches you don’t normally miss, you might just barely miss because all of the other things he can do.”Konerko could have gone on like that, in far greater detail, about the physical reasons he struck out: the mechanics of his swing, the subtle movements of his hands and hips and feet. Konerko, 35, has an unusually keen understanding of how he hits, constantly thinking about the best method to get to the same point, where bat meets ball and often sends it far. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      “I’m sure a lot of hitting coaches would probably say, ‘Shut up and go hit,’ ” said Greg Walker, who has coached the White Sox’ hitters since 2003. “But that’s just not how his brain works. He’s a very smart, intellectual guy. Sometimes I think he’s too smart to play baseball. But he’s pulled it off, he’s had a great career, and he’s still going strong.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Konerko is hitting .313 with five homers, picking up where he left off in 2010. According to FanGraphs, Konerko created 3.45 more runs off fastballs last season than the average hitter, the best figure in the majors. The next closest in the American League was Josh Hamilton of Texas (3.31), and Joey Votto of Cincinnati (2.84) led the National League. Hamilton and Votto won the Most Valuable Player awards for their leagues.Such fame has escaped Konerko, despite playing in a major media market for 13 seasons. He has often been overshadowed as a slugger on his own team, and even when he hit a grand slam in Game 2 of the 2005 World Series, a different hitter — Scott Podsednik — got the game-winner and the cover of Sports Illustrated.Konerko has compiled 363 home runs and 1,143 runs batted in for the White Sox, trailing only Frank Thomas in the 111-year history of the franchise. Jim Thome, Ken Griffey Jr. and Manny Ramirez have passed through during Konerko’s tenure, and last winter the White Sox signed Adam Dunn, a signal to some that the team had found a full-time replacement for his power.

He also came back after the 2005 championship, rejecting a richer offer from the Baltimore Orioles. Both times, he said, the presence of Walker played into his decision.

Huh/Associated Press           Konerko was lost when Walker took over as hitting coach in May 2003, his average buried at .221, his power sapped. He had an inquisitive mind, but little grasp of what makes a successful hitter, even with a model like Thomas as a teammate.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “I would look at Frank, and that didn’t appeal to my eye,” Konerko said. “I wasn’t thinking like that back then, as far as where weight was distributed — that’s not the way I hit. Now I look at it and it’s like, he was hitting the right way. That’s exactly what I would like to do.”Walker told Konerko that he wanted him to understand his swing, and warned that he might not see results right away. Though Konerko did not improve very much, finishing the season at .234, he liked the way he could drive the ball to center and right.

Konerko can tinker with the rest of it, especially the placement of his hands.

No. 72?’ ”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Yet Walker marvels at Konerko’s tools and his intellect. Walker played first base for the White Sox from 1982 to 1990, and said he never mastered the proper swing, especially against hard throwers. Konerko, he said, is talented enough to execute the right mechanics and bright enough to adjust them from pitch to pitch.“If we can ever get him down to less than five mechanical thoughts that he’s having during an at-bat, he’s a very dangerous man,” Walker said. “I don’t think I’ve ever been around anybody who can have mechanical thoughts in the box and still be successful. He’s the only one.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Konerko said every hitter thinks about mechanics at the plate; it’s simply a matter of focusing on the proper cues. He recognizes his limitations, knowing he must do just enough damage on off-speed pitches to get the fastballs he devours.The plan, Walker said, is always to gear for a fastball, which puts a hitter in position to drive any pitch. But that cannot happen without solid mechanics, and Walker said he had spent more time dissecting the subject with Konerko than with all his other hitters combined.Konerko could make a good hitting coach, Walker said, though he laughed and said he would not wish the job on anyone. With two young children, Konerko said he doubted it would appeal to him. Besides, he added, he has spent enough time trying to master the art of his craft.

Also pictured is Baltimore Orioles' Adam Jones (10). MoreOne night after getting stomped by the New York Yankees, the Baltimore Orioles turned in an inspired performance against their AL East rivals.Unfortunately for Baltimore, the game had a sickeningly familiar ending.Russell Martin singled home the tiebreaking run in the 11th inning after Mariano Rivera gave up the lead in the ninth, and the Yankees escaped with a 6-3 victory Sunday.Less than 24 hours earlier, the Orioles yielded five home runs in a 15-3 defeat. In this one, they rallied from a three-run deficit and forced extra innings on a double by Brian Roberts with two outs in the bottom of the ninth.It all came apart in the 11th, however, after a 40-minute rain delay."I won't say it messed us up," center fielder Adam Jones said, "but we had a lot of momentum going before it. What can you do?"In a three-run 11th, the Yankees got three infield hits and took advantage of two Baltimore throwing errors."We didn't do enough to win," Jones conceded.But at least Baltimore didn't go quietly after falling behind 3-0."I was real proud of everybody," manager Buck Showalter said. "We'll get some breaks to go our way and we'll keep battling."Mark Reynolds, who hit a two-run homer, said, "We just got some bad bounces here, bad bounces there, and come out on the losing end somehow."Robinson Cano led off the 11th with a double off Jason Berken (0-1). After Nick Swisher failed on a bunt attempt, Cano was caught between the bases. Catcher Matt Wieters threw to second, and Cano scampered safely to third.Swisher struck out, and after an intentional walk to Eric Chavez, Martin hit a grounder deep in the hole to shortstop Robert Andino, who threw wildly to second in a desperate attempt to start a double play."It's just a firm ground ball that was hit in the right spot," Showalter said. "Robert tried to make a great play and I applaud him for it."One out later, Derek Jeter hit a slow roller to third, and Reynolds' throw went awry on what was ruled an infield hit. Curtis Granderson followed with an RBI single off the glove of Roberts at second base.Boone Logan (1-1) got four outs, and Buddy Carlyle retired the final two batters.Jeter had four hits for the Yankees, who earned their sixth straight series win at Camden Yards. New York is 41-17 against Baltimore since the start of the 2008 season.After Reynolds homered off Chamberlain to make it 3-2 in the seventh, the Orioles drew even in the ninth. With runners on first and second and two outs, Roberts bounced a double into the right-field corner. One run scored, but Andino was thrown out at the plate by Cano, who took the relay from Swisher."A perfect relay is what it takes," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "Swish comes up and hits the cutoff man, hits Robbie, and Robbie makes a good throw and we get Andino."In the top of the 10th, New York had runners at the corners with one out when Alex Rodriguez lifted a fly ball to medium center. Jeter tagged up at third and Jones uncorked a dart that reached Wieters in the air.Wieters had the plate blocked, and he tagged Jeter for the final out."Pretty simple," Jones said. "Who cares about the cutoff man in that situation? If I one-hopped it or anything like that, he would have been safe."Freddy Garcia pitched six innings of two-hit ball for New York and left with a 3-0 lead. He struck out seven and walked two in his second start with the Yankees. The right-hander permitted one runner past second base and retired 13 of the last 14 batters he faced.With the score 3-2 in the eighth, the Orioles got runners on the corners with two outs in the eighth against David Robertson.Rivera came in to face Luke Scott, who hit an opposite-field liner to left that the speedy Brett Gardner snagged just short of the warning track. In a rare outburst of emotion, a grinning Rivera thrust his right arm upward before walking off the mound."It's a game-saving play is what it is," Girardi said.Orioles starter Jake Arrieta gave up three runs, five hits and three walks in six innings. The right-hander had a career-high nine strikeouts.New York needed only four pitches to take a 2-0 lead. After Jeter singled on Arrieta's first offering, Granderson hit a 1-1 pitch into the right-field seats, his team-high seventh homer of the season.Arrieta rebounded from his poor start to keep the Yankees in check until the fifth, when Granderson doubled and scored on a grounder by Rodriguez.NOTES: Reynolds' homer ended his 0-for-22 skid. ... Roberts stretched his hitting streak to 11 games. ... Cano extended his hitting streak to 13 games, and now has hit in 16 straight games against the Orioles.

Baltimore rallied from a three-run deficit against Joba Chamberlain and Rivera; both teams had the go-ahead run thrown at the plate in the late innings; and the Yankees ultimately won on the strength of three infield hits and a couple of Baltimore errors in a wild 11th.Robinson Cano led off the inning with a double off Jason Berken (0-1).
