Cheers arose from about a thousand fans still at Yankee Stadium who had endured a 4-hour-3-minute rain delay.The veteran-laden Yankees had avoided a Wednesday doubleheader — or, rather, two full games Wednesday, since Tuesday’s game did not end until 2:15 a.m. Wednesday. They beat the Orioles, 5-3, on back-to-back home runs with two outs in the seventh inning.Even though it was 1:35 a.m., the umpires stopped the game to review Francisco Cervelli’s go-ahead home run. The ball was touched by one of two fans at the left-field fence but counted, anyway. Brett Gardner followed with a line-drive home run on a 3-0 count that hit the right-field foul pole.“Every time you come here, you’ve got to be ready for everything,” Cervelli said, smiling.The victory, capped by Mariano Rivera’s 598th career save, was the Yankees’ sixth in a row and ninth in 10 games. They maintained a two-and-a-half-game lead in the American League East over the Boston Red Sox, who beat Toronto much earlier in the night, 14-0.

That is the makeup of a game that was to be played Aug. 27 in Baltimore but was rained out because of Hurricane Irene.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But they will not have to play a doubleheader Wednesday. Asked if it really was better to play so late at night than to play two games in the same day, Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said, “Both scenarios weren’t great, but now that it’s over, I’m glad it’s done.”After Thursday’s game, the Yankees will head to Anaheim, Calif., for a three-game series against the Angels that opens Friday night.After center fielder Curtis Granderson peered into a steady rain to catch a fifth-inning fly ball by Nick Markakis with the Yankees leading, 1-0, the Yankee Stadium grounds crew, cheered at 10:29 p.m. when it popped out of a tunnel to take off the tarpaulin, scampered onto the infield. It scattered bag after bag of drying agent on the rain-soaked dirt, as if it might make a difference.

They could redeem their tickets to any Yankees game — next season.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  There were four errors in Tuesday’s game, but Girardi said, “As many plays as the infielders made, I was actually shocked.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees took a 1-0 lead on a bases-empty third-inning home run by Jorge Posada, the designated hitter instead of the 21-year-old rookie Jesus Montero, who hit two home runs in Monday’s 11-10 victory over Baltimore. It was the 13th home run of the season for Posada.Posada scored again in the fifth inning, reaching base when Baltimore first baseman Mark Reynolds bobbled his two-out ground ball. Cervelli hit a towering, wind-blown fly that Angle misjudged in left, the ball caroming off his glove. Posada rumbled home from first.But Orioles catcher Matt Wieters tied the score in the sixth inning by clobbering an 0-2 pitch by Hughes into the right-field seats with Vladimir Guerrero at first base. Those were the only runs given up in six innings by Hughes, who allowed five hits.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Hughes said the fifth inning was the most challenging, at least as far as the conditions. He said he threw a fastball to Markakis, “hoping that it would end up over the plate.” Photo       The Yankees and Orioles found themselves in a familiar place again as rain pelted Yankee Stadium.  Credit             Bill Kostroun/Associated Press           Later, he added, “When I don’t know where it’s going, that’s usually not a good thing.”The Yankees took the lead again on a sixth-inning single by Mark Teixeira, who drove in Derek Jeter with a hard shot off the right-field fence. But the Orioles tied the score again in the top of the seventh inning on a two-out double by Markakis off Yankees reliever Boone Logan.

Privacy Policy    The Yankees have only one day off the rest of the season — and that day, Sept. 15, is not really a day off because the team is due to arrive in Toronto early that morning after playing the night before in Seattle. So a Wednesday doubleheader against the Orioles was the next option.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “The last thing we want is a doubleheader,” Girardi said. “We’ve had our share of those.”Tuesday’s game was the Yankees’ 20th this season that had been affected by weather, and they entered the day leading the majors with eight games that had been postponed. Girardi had decided well before the game to give third baseman Alex Rodriguez the night off.There had been lingering resentment between the teams because the Orioles two weeks ago rejected a proposal by the Yankees to move up a scheduled doubleheader in Baltimore to Friday, Aug. 26, from Saturday, Aug. 27, because of Hurricane Irene. The Yankees were miffed, but so was Orioles Manager Buck Showalter, who said in published reports that the Yankees were being disrespectful to the organization after the death of former Orioles pitcher Mike Flanagan.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  They ended up playing a doubleheader Aug. 28, then completed the series Aug. 29. Had they played the doubleheader that Friday, another one that Sunday or Monday, and a single game Sunday or Monday, the Yankees would have Thursday off.“It’s hard to believe we’re talking about this again, isn’t it?” Girardi said.Brackman Is Up  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  A group of young men lugging blue duffel bags entered the Yankees’ clubhouse and hunted for their new lockers.

He started the season as a relief pitcher, was moved into the rotation, then rejoined the bullpen.Brackman said he became so discouraged that at one point he thought about quitting. He had pitched poorly against Durham in a June game that was played not that far from North Carolina State, where he played basketball and baseball.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  He said he was so upset that he did not take a shower and thought hard about not climbing on the team bus. He called his father, who told him to get on the bus, primarily because the Brackmans did not exactly have a backup plan.

He walked nine batters and gave up three runs in three and a third innings in what would be his final start of the season, an 8-5 loss July 29 at Buffalo.He was sent to the bullpen, and he tinkered with his mechanics. He salvaged his season. He gave up only three earned runs in nine relief appearances covering 201/3 innings. He also won a game, bringing his season record to 3-6. Besides holding his hands higher when he was in the set position, he said he began to relax. “No matter where I was,” he said, “I just wasn’t comfortable with my mechanics — how the ball came out of my hand.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Later, he smiled when he said: “I’m big.

"I played a lot of third in Texas," he said, "so it's no big deal. I played third [Monday in Bowie]. I feel pretty comfortable there. I think Mark [Reynolds] has done a great job at first base. I think they feel really comfortable with him there, so I'll be playing more third." Davis' return to the hot corner, however, was delayed by the steady rain that fell on Yankee Stadium from morning till night Tuesday. The start of the game was delayed by more than four hours, and a light rain was still falling when the Yankees took the field at 11:08 p.m. The outcome of the game — or the fate of it — had not been determined by press time. var adSkipCounter = 0;  Davis wasn't complaining. He said he has been pleasantly surprised at how well his sore shoulder has responded during his stay on the disabled list. "I was kind of surprised it felt as good as it did as early as it did," he said. "I went down to Florida for about a week, and after a few days of doing some exercises, it started to feel a little better. … With the season winding down, it's good to know that I can come back and play a few games before the offseason starts to hopefully try to get in a little groove." Pitchers Jeremy Accardo and Clap Rapada and infielders Josh Bell and Pedro Florimon Jr. also joined the Orioles and were in the clubhouse waiting to see whether the rain would relent. The non-DL roster moves did not become official until the game finally started. To make room on the 40-man roster for Accardo and Rapada, the Orioles designated veteran left-hander Mark Hendrickson and infielder Blake Davis for assignment. Iron anniversary Tuesday was the 16th anniversary of Cal Ripken Jr.'s historic 2,131st consecutive game, a record that just about everyone agrees will never be broken. "No. Never happen," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "I'm not real sure how it happened to start with. It's amazing. I love to listen to Richie [Bancells] — our trainer — tell stories about it. I look at the way I consider Nicky [Markakis] and Adam Jones and some of the people, and I can't imagine doing that for that length of time. It's amazing. It's as impressive a stat as any in sports for me. I don't think you'll ever see that approached." On the subject of Sept. 6 anniversaries, Tuesday was also the 14th anniversary of Eddie Murray's 500th homer. Schilling sighting Boston Red Sox postseason hero and former Oriole Curt Schilling stopped by the Orioles' clubhouse for a visit late Tuesday afternoon. Schilling was dealt to the Orioles on July 30, 1988, along with Brady Anderson in the trade that sent Mike Boddicker to the Red Sox. Anderson was also in the Orioles' clubhouse Tuesday when Schilling visited. peter.schmuck@baltsun.com Orioles Insider | Live scores | Photos | Baseball app     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: 'thumbnails-f',     container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives',     placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives',     target_type: 'mix'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed'Blushing' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn't to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun)MoreThe final month of the baseball season is upon us, and intrigue is unusually absent with the postseason looming.The contenders have been identified, and the pretenders are looking forward to the offseason.Four of the six division leaders have cushions of at least six games, and the wild-card races are all but over as well. The Phillies, Brewers and Diamondbacks are rolling to division titles in the National League, with the Atlanta Braves enjoying a comfortable lead over St. Louis and San Francisco for the NL wild card.Things are a little tighter in the American League, which features the only two races worth watching. Justin Verlander and the Tigers are up 7½ games on the Cleveland Indians in the AL Central, but it does get interesting on both coasts.The New York Yankees lead the Boston Red Sox by 2½ games in the East. And even though the loser of the race will get into the playoffs, there is still that division title and valuable playoff positioning at stake.Out West, the defending AL champion Texas Rangers have seemed like the class of the division for most of the season, but the Los Angeles Angels and their stellar rotation just keep hanging around. The Angels were 3½ games back with 22 games to play, plenty of time to make their move.The champion Giants already have started cutting some of their veterans loose, so if the Rangers falter in the AL, that would mean that neither team from last year's World Series would make the playoffs for just the third time since 1991, according to STATS, LLC.The Cardinals and Tigers failed to make it in 2007 after facing off in the '06 World Series and the White Sox and Astros both missed out in 2006 after playing in '05.With so much of the drama missing from the push for the playoffs, much of the attention will turn to the MVP races, which are as wide open as ever.Will Verlander become the first pitcher since 1992 to win in the AL? Will Matt Kemp be able to overcome the Dodgers' lousy season to win it in the National League?Here's a quick look at what to watch for as the 2011 regular season winds to a close:___BEST RACES: All the action is in the American League this September.—AL East: Ever since picking up hit No. 3,000, Derek Jeter has put all those questions about being washed up behind him and Curtis Granderson continues his pursuit of the MVP award as the Yankees lead the Red Sox.—AL West: The Rangers led the division by as many as seven games in the middle of August, but Jered Weaver, Dan Haren and Ervin Santana have pitched the Angels right back into the mix. They trailed the Rangers by 3½ games when Monday began.___MVP WATCH: September performances likely will be the decider in two very interesting races.—American League: Verlander (21-5, 2.34 ERA, 224 Ks, four CGs) has been the most dominant pitcher in the league this season, carrying the Tigers to the top of the AL Central. With no position player running away with the award this season, there appears to be a groundswell of support for making the right-hander the first MVP pitcher since Oakland closer Dennis Eckersley in 1992. Blue Jays outfielder Jose Bautista (.306, 40 HRs, 92 RBIs, 110 BBs, .632 slg, .444 OBP) is having a remarkable season, but may be hindered by Toronto's lack of success. Granderson (.271, 38 HRs, 109 RBIs) is having a breakout season for the league's best team, and Dustin Pedroia, Jacoby Ellsbury and Adrian Gonzalez could split the vote in Boston.—National League: Ryan Braun (.335, 27 HRs, 95 RBIs, 35 2Bs, 31 SBs) and Prince Fielder (.293, 31 HRs, 107 RBIs, 31 2Bs, 91 BBs) have powered the Brewers to the top of the NL Central. Kemp (.320, 32 HRs, 106 RBIs, 37 SBs) is having the best season in the NL, but the Dodgers haven't been a factor in the West for more than two months while Justin Upton (.296, 27 HRs, 82 RBIs, 37 2Bs, 20 SBs) would have to be considered the longest of long shots for the surprising Diamondbacks.___BIG SERIES: Unless some major surges or collapses happen over the next few weeks, these two series will be the ones to look forward to in the AL East and AL West:—Yankees at Red Sox, Sept. 23-25: The Yankees and Red Sox meet for three games in the Bronx, the second-to-last series of the regular season for both teams. A sweep by either team could lock up the division title.—Rangers at Angels, Sept. 26-28: If the Angels stay within three games of Texas, the final series of the year will give them a chance at home to surge to the top.___SPOILER ALERT!: As the season comes to a close, plenty of teams have been out of it for months. But a few have a chance to play a major role in how the playoff picture shakes out:—Tampa Bay Rays: Playing in the powerful AL East has been too much for them this year, but they still have the talent to go toe-to-toe with the elite down the stretch. The Rays face the Red Sox seven times in September and play the Yankees six times in the last nine days, including a three-game set at the Trop to finish the season. The Rays beat the Rangers 5-1 on Monday in the opener of a three-game set.—Oakland Athletics: It's been another disappointing year for the A's, who have gone through a managerial change and faded from contention after a decent start to the season. But with a talented young pitching staff, the A's could be dangerous down the stretch. They won four in a row heading into Monday night's game against the Royals, and continuing that winning streak could buoy their confidence for six games against the Rangers and six against the Angels in the final three weeks.___Follow Jon Krawczynski on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/APkrawczynski
