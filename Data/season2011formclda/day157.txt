3 ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The Baltimore Orioles took a quick lead and promptly gave it back. The end result was another loss in a dismal season.B.J. Upton had five RBIs, Wade Davis pitched effectively into the seventh inning and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Orioles 6-3 on Saturday night.Nick Markakis hit a two-run homer in the first for the Orioles (55-82), who are now saddled with their 14th straight losing record. Baltimore came up short in its bid to win six straight road games for the first time since Aug. 29-Sept 4, 2004."I don't get involved in that mentality," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said about possibly having a here-we-go-again feeling about blowing the early lead. "It's something that doesn't happen every night, but it's happened too much. It's something that we will get better at."Upton hit a two-out, three-run double off Alfredo Simon (4-8) to make it 6-2 in the fifth. The Rays tied it at 2 during the first when Upton drove in two runs on a double."The command of the fastball has got to be there to pitch at this level," Showalter said. "Tonight wasn't one of those nights."Upton had just 16 RBIs in his previous 63 home games this season."I walked a couple guys and then when the bases were loaded, I tried to throw a strike, but I left the fastball up and he just hit the ball," Simon said. "I left my pitches up today and there is no excuse for that."Simon gave up six runs and seven hits over five-plus innings.Both of Upton's run-scoring hits came after Matt Joyce drew two-out walks."If you're a competitor, you do (take it personally)," Upton said. "Nobody likes the guy in front of him walked to get to yourself, so you want to rise to the occasion. It just happened to work out."Joyce had a third-inning RBI double to give Tampa Bay a 3-2 lead.Davis (9-8) allowed three runs and five hits in 6 2-3 innings. The right-hander struck out five and walked four. Kyle Farnsworth, the third Tampa Bay reliever, pitched the ninth for his 23rd save.Markakis entered with four hits in his previous 38 at-bats, and wound up 1 for 2 with two walks on Saturday.Baltimore got within 6-3 when Matt Wieters had a run-scoring single in the sixth. Davis avoided further damage by getting an inning-ending double play from Robert Andino with the bases loaded."We had some chances to really climb back in that thing," Showalter said. "We were ahead 2-0, and then we went right out and gave it right back."Wieters has driven in 15 runs over his last 13 games.NOTES: Baltimore has one hit in its last 11 at-bats with the bases loaded. ... Orioles RHP Tommy Hunter (flulike symptoms) remains on target to pitch Tuesday against the New York Yankees. ... Baltimore LHP Brian Matusz is scheduled to make his next start Monday in New York after being skipped one time through the rotation. ...

(AP Photo/Brian Blanco)MoreST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Jeremy Guthrie struggled with his command, and that was all Jeremy Hellickson needed to record another victory over the Baltimore Orioles.Guthrie pitched five shaky innings in his major league-leading 17th loss and Hellickson threw a four-hitter in the Tampa Bay Rays' 8-1 victory Sunday.Hellickson (12-10) has two complete games this season, both against the Orioles. The rookie right-hander also tossed a four-hitter in a 3-0 win against Baltimore on May 13 during which Guthrie also went the distance.Guthrie (6-17) gave up seven runs — three earned — and seven hits Sunday. The right-hander struck out five and walked four."I didn't have a good feel for the strike zone," Guthrie said. "I wasn't aggressive in the strike zone."Tampa Bay scored four times with two out in the third to take a 6-0 lead. Evan Longoria came home when third baseman Mark Reynolds misplayed Brandon Guyer's grounder, and Reid Brignac followed with a three-run double.Guthrie walked three during the third and after the inning ended appeared ready to throw a Gatorade bucket all around dugout."Just a lot of frustration," Guthrie said. "I grabbed it and wanted to do a lot more things with it, but kind of dragged it and set it down. Figured I didn't deserve a drink of Gatorade that inning."Guthrie became the first pitcher since Kip Wells (2005 and 2007) to lose at least 17 games twice during his career. The right-hander went 10-17 in 2009.Adam Jones homered for the Orioles, who have lost six of eight.Hellickson improved to 4-1 in five starts — six appearances overall — against Baltimore, including wins in all three outings at home where he has surrendered two earned runs in 25 combined innings."You know exactly what he's going to do and try to do," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "He's got a great presentation on his change up and breaking ball. Throws everything out of the same slot. He's grasped pitching instead of throwing at a young age. He's got a lot of ability."Sean Rodriguez hit a two-run homer in the second for Tampa Bay. Rodriguez's two-out drive to left on a 1-2 pitch was his seventh homer of the season.The Rays scored all of their runs in Saturday's 6-3 win over Baltimore in two-out situations.Matt Joyce drove in two runs for Tampa Bay, including a two-out solo homer in the sixth.Jones led off the fifth with his 23rd homer. He had just three hits in his previous 37 at-bats.Jones also doubled in the seventh, and Robert Andino and J.J. Hardy had the other hits for Baltimore. Andino's third-inning infield hit was originally ruled an error on shortstop Brignac.Tampa Bay designated hitter Johnny Damon tied Doc Cramer for 62nd place on the career hits list at 2,705 with a fourth-inning single.NOTES: Jones tied his career high with 25 doubles this season. ... Reynolds made two errors and has 26 on the year. ... Tampa Bay CF B.J. Upton rested one day after getting five RBIs. "That was planned before (Saturday's game)," manager Joe Maddon said. ... Orioles RF Nick Markakis made his second career start at first base and had a couple nice fielding plays. ... Rays INF Ben Zobrist (neck stiffness) could return to the starting lineup Monday. ...
