On the back, it said, “Sick Day.” On the front was a small illustration of a person hunched over a toilet bowl.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Welcome to the final series of the regular season, one in which the Red Sox are close to flushing away a season that once brimmed with championship optimism, one that found them with a nine-game lead over Tampa Bay in the American League wild-card race as recently as Sept. 4.Now they are tied after Josh Beckett and the Sox were beaten Monday night by the Orioles, 6-3, while the Rays beat the Yankees, 5-2, in St. Petersburg. The wave of nausea that has swept New England keeps getting worse.“We rely so much on Beckett,” Red Sox Manager Terry Francona said disconsolately, knowing he is down to Erik Bedard on Tuesday and Jon Lester on short rest Wednesday against a team that has beaten Boston in four of the last five games.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  For those hoping the Yankees would ease the burden on the Sox by taking care of the resurgent Rays, Francona suggested the Sox and their fans refrain from scoreboard watching. That seemed like good advice when the Yankees trotted out Hector Noesi to start Monday, a clear demonstration of priorities.

East and home field in the playoffs during the last week.“If any team goes into a series and plays not to win, it can hurt you,” Gonzalez said. “All ballplayers know that. You go into the playoffs and you may not be able to just turn it on again.” [{"headline":"Sports","summary":"Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, delivered to your inbox every week.","product-code":"SP","product-title":"Sports","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/sports?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=SP&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Race\/Related Newsletter","summary":"Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with New York Times journalists.","product-code":"RR","product-title":"Race Related","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/race-related?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=RR&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Your Money","summary":"Every week, get tips on retirement, paying for college, credit cards and the right way to invest.","product-code":"MY","product-title":"Your Money","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/your-money?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=business&contentId=MY&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"}]      Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We haven’t won many of them. But what we’ve got to remember is that we played great baseball for most of the season, and that’s what got us in this position to get into the playoffs.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Their position weakened considerably when Beckett surrendered two home runs, the backbreaker a three-run inside-the-park drive to dead center by the Orioles’ ninth-place hitter, Robert Andino, to cap a four-run sixth. Jacoby Ellsbury got to the ball but dropped it when he hit the wall. Ellsbury crumpled to the ground, Andino circled the bases and the relay to the plate went past the catcher, Jarrod Saltalamacchia.“A fastball, right over the plate,” Beckett said. “We’ve got to win games. We’re not going to do it when the starting pitcher gives up six runs and most of the guys got in at 4 in the morning.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  That was courtesy of the Yankees, who dragged the Sox into the 14th inning late Sunday night in the one game Boston managed to win in New York.Distress has now enveloped the Red Sox like a bad soap opera. At least they had a noisy contingent of supporting fans, a majority of whom settled in the stands behind Boston’s third-base dugout, praying for the Sox to snap out of it and for a little help from their new friends on the west coast of Florida.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  They got neither. For Red Sox Nation, one bad omen follows another. For the Patriots fans who traveled here, it was the Brady bunch’s loss at Buffalo on Sunday afternoon that presaged more pain Monday night.“How do you blow a 21-0 lead?” Gina Targhetta said of the Patriots.To which Dan Skiba said, “How do you blow a nine-game lead in September?”The Sox have blown all of it now. Two games to go. Two games to redemption, or death.

PETERSBURG, Fla. — It was a night for cheering at Tropicana Field on Monday — for the exploits on the field and for events taking place in Baltimore that were illuminated on the out-of-town scoreboard.Even though the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Yankees, 5-2, in front of 18,772 dedicated fans, the biggest cheer seemed to emanate from the Rays’ clubhouse, where the entire Rays team, including coaches, trainers and attendants, watched with delight as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the collapsing Boston Red Sox, 6-3.When the final out was made, a roar went up and the Rays were tied with Boston for first place in the American League wild-card race.“It’s weird when you win and then you are rooting for somebody to lose,” third baseman Evan Longoria said. “But at this point, we need a little help, and that was some big help today.” Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The Rays’ effort — highlighted by eight and two-thirds splendid innings from James Shields, and a remarkable diving catch by left fielder Desmond Jennings on Derek Jeter’s fly ball in the seventh — gave Tampa Bay its first piece of the wild-card lead since May 23.

Upton had a two-run double and Johnny Damon, the former Yankee and Red Sox star, added two R.B.I. for the surging Rays, who have won four of their last five games.“This is our playoffs,” Shields said. “It’s already begun.”There are now only two games remaining in the regular season, and perhaps no team has been as much a part of this unexpected rendezvous in the standings between the Rays and the Red Sox than the Yankees.They are a pace car leading the field. On Saturday the Yankees had grabbed every possible regular-season plum, including the East title and home-field advantage through the first two rounds of the playoffs.

It was a nine-game lead over the Rays on Sept. 2. The Rays had lost three of four games to the Yankees last week at Yankee Stadium, but facing them again they played with an extra sizzle that only a team fighting for the playoffs can muster.

That includes some rest for the exhausted, especially pitchers. But it also means maintaining precision timing and a sharpened focus for his players.

I watched a little bit over the weekend and I watched tonight. These guys are not mailing anything in at this particular moment. They’re playing their typical game.”There was some evidence of the Yankees competitive fire still burning in the fifth inning when starting catcher Russell Martin was ejected by the home plate umpire Paul Schreiber for arguing balls and strikes.And Jeter, who hit two balls to the warning track, looked absolutely stunned at Jennings’s marvelous catch.

But after that Shields knocked over a cup of coffee in the dugout and it spilled all over his uniform. He went back into the clubhouse and changed, and after that he was almost flawless.Just as it was with the cheering on Monday, a lot of the action seemed to take place in the clubhouse.Inside pitchCatcher Francisco Cervelli, who is recovering from a concussion, felt the symptoms return after doing some catching work and likely will be shut down for the rest of the season.

Joe Girardi expressed some discontent with the playoff format, which begins Friday for the Yankees. “It is kind of weird,” he said. “The only thing I question is not having two days off before the playoffs.”  A version of this article appears in print on September 27, 2011, on Page B15 of the New York edition with the headline: Yanks Set Own Agenda as Division Rivals Battle to Finish.

6  Wow. There was just a lot of awesomeness tonight. The Red Sox continued their plummet, the Orioles continued their hot September, Robert Andino hit an inside-the-park home run the first time his dad ever came to see him play professional baseball, and of course, the Rays won as well, tying things up in the wild-card race.  Normally, with Josh Beckett on the mound against the Orioles in September would be the recipe for disaster, but in the bizarro world that is September 2011, it didn't really matter.  The game started off poorly for O's starter Tommy Hunter, as two walks and a single in the first inning loaded the bases with two outs, but a fly ball out from Jed Lowrie ended the inning. The Red Sox got on the board in the second inning when a double by Jacoby Ellsbury knocked in J.D. Drew, but the Orioles got that right back in the bottom of the inning courtesy of Matt Wieters' 21st home run of the year.  Lowrie homered to lead off the fourth inning, but in the bottom of the fifth Chris Davis singled in the tying run. The O's loaded the bases with only one out after Davis' single, but J.J. Hardy and Nick Markakis couldn't break open the game.     Tommy Hunter's pulled groin was acting up and so, despite his fine pitching, he came out of the game after five innings. Thankfully the O's bullpen was more than up for the task. Troy Patton retired all five batters he faced, and he was followed by Willie Eyre, Clay Rapada, and Pedro Strop, none of whom allowed a run.     The Orioles went ahead to stay in the sixth inning with four runs against Beckett. After Vladimir Guerrero led off with a single, Wieters lined out Adam Jones struck out. But Mark Reynolds walked to put two runners on for Davis, who lined a double to left field. The ball rattled around in the corner and Vlad scored easily. Reynolds would have scored as well, but he fell down rounding third and had to go back.  With a runner on third and two down, Robert Andino came to the plate. The cameras had panned to Andino's father in the stands several times during the game, and the adorable Mr. Andino watched eagerly as his son stood in the batters box. Dino his a fly ball to deep center field. Jacoby Ellsbury raced back, back, back, and jumped up to get the ball. For a second it looked like he made an outstanding catch,  but when he crashed into the wall the ball popped out of his glove. Reynolds had already scored easily and Dino flew around the bases. The throw home was a good one and it short hopped Jarrod Saltalamacchia. Salty couldn't handle it and Andino scored easily. Just awesome!     That made the score 6-2 in favor of the Orioles. Matt Angle tried to bunt for a base hit to extend the inning, but he was thrown out. When the game came back from commercial, Mr. Andino was in the stands calling everyone he knew to tell them about Robbie's inside the parker. It was fantastic.  Jim Johnson came in to close the game and he got into trouble, hitting Ellsbury and balking him over to second where scored on a single by Dustin Pedroia. But he got out of it and struck out Jed Lowrie to end the game. The Rays defeated the Yankees several minutes before the O's game ended, and so they broadcast this game on the jumbotron in Tampa so that the fans there could cheer the Orioles to victory.  You know, it's not the playoffs, and what I really want more than anything is for the Orioles to be good again. But baseball has been fun the last few weeks, and for an Orioles fan in September 2011, I'll take it.
