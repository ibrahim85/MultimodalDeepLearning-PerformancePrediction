There was Mark Teixeira hitting another home run. There was Robinson Cano blasting his third grand slam of the season. There was Curtis Granderson smacking a two-run double. There were all three adding to their triple-digit runs-batted-in statistics.But the heart of the Yankees’ lineup, intimidating as it is, was suddenly pushed aside in the middle of the game when the team’s top prospect, the imposing-looking Jesus Montero, emphatically announced his arrival in the major leagues with a loud swing of the bat, a trot around the bases and a curtain call from the roaring crowd.And then, having swatted his first major league home run, the 21-year-old rookie Montero did it all over again two innings later, hitting another opposite-field blast into the right-field stands that landed almost exactly where the first drive did and led to an encore wave to the crowd from the dugout steps.The display of power by the 6-foot-3, 235-pound Montero gave the Yankees the three extra runs they needed to hold off the Orioles, 11-10, and widen their division lead over the suddenly struggling Boston Red Sox to two and a half games. It also prompted everyone associated with the Yankees — players, coaches, the manager and fans already ruminating about a 28th championship — to think about what Montero might mean for the Yankees this October and in years to come. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Complicating all the projections about Montero, of course, is that he does not have a clear-cut position to play, with many in baseball somewhat skeptical of his abilities as a catcher. For the moment, he is a designated hitter, and on Monday that was certainly good enough to get everyone’s attention.

When Montero came to the plate in the bottom of the fifth, the Orioles had tied the score, 8-8. Having been called up on Sept. 1, Montero had fewer than a dozen major league at-bats under his belt at that point, but he proceeded to propel an 0-1 fastball from Baltimore’s Jim Johnson. Two innings later, he victimized Johnson again. Photo       Robinson Cano watching his grand slam in the Yankees' six-run second inning. It was Cano's third grand slam of the season.  Credit             Bill Kostroun/Associated Press           Montero caught in 88 games at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre this season — over all, he hit .288 with 18 home runs — but whether he can be a defensively competent catcher in the majors is still open to question. He was not overly impressive in spring training, when he seemed to have a shot at being the Yankees’ backup catcher behind Russell Martin.

That leaves catcher, if Montero can actually master the position. Or even a trade, if he can help bring a top-flight pitcher in return.

Privacy Policy    Manager Joe Girardi reiterated after Monday’s game that he was reluctant to put Montero behind the plate at this point of the season because of his lack of familiarity with the Yankees’ pitchers. Still, Girardi, a longtime catcher himself, said the Yankees continued to project Montero as a player whose future is behind the plate.

At some point, I’d like to put him back there, but we’ll have to see where we’re at.”The Yankees managed to retrieve each of Montero’s home run balls, with the fans who caught them getting baseballs autographed by Montero in exchange. Not exactly the largesse that another fan, Christian Lopez, received from the Yankees when he ended up grabbing Derek Jeter’s 3,000th hit — a homer to left — and then returning the baseball to the Yankee captain.But Jeter is Jeter and Montero has plenty of time to carve out his own career, impressive as the first glimpses already are.“I showed a little bit to the fans and the people,” Montero said. “Now there’s more to come. I hope everything keeps going good. I’m not going to say tomorrow I’m going to hit two home runs again. But I’m going to try to.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  INSIDE PITCHMariano Rivera gave up a run in the ninth inning but earned his 597th career save, moving him closer to Trevor Hoffman, the career leader with 601. ... In his first game as a Yankee in four years, Scott Proctor pitched two innings and gave up a game-tying home run in the fifth. Proctor was a workhouse reliever for Joe Torre’s Yankees in the middle part of the last decade, although it was widely felt that he was overused. He was picked up by the Yankees after being released by the Atlanta Braves last month.
