In a Tuesday morning interview on WEEI, Schilling measured the Red Sox’ untimely tailspin, 14 losses in 19 games, and concluded, “I don’t think they’re going to make it.”He meant the playoffs, which a few weeks ago seemed a certainty, before a crisis of pitching, health and collective spirit sent the Red Sox tumbling. By Tuesday, they clung to a slim lead over Tampa Bay for the wild-card berth, having all but surrendered their chance at the division title.That lead remained two games (one in the loss column) after a predictably torturous 7-5 loss to the Baltimore Orioles. Starter Erik Bedard lasted just two and two-thirds innings. Jonathan Papelbon, the usually reliable closer, blew a 5-4 lead with two outs in the eighth. The tailspin stands at 15 losses in 20 games.

Still, there was little to disprove the notion, offered by Schilling, that the season is “crashing down around” the Red Sox and that “there’s been a huge momentum shift” in favor of the Rays.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  By the time Schilling’s proclamation was relayed to him Tuesday afternoon, Manager Terry Francona was already in mid-snarl, responding with a dismissive “O.K.” followed by an unprintable rejoinder, followed by a simple “I don’t care.”Seven autumns ago, Schilling helped lead the Red Sox renaissance, anchoring a historic comeback from a 3-0 deficit in the American League Championship Series and helping them claim the 2004 championship. It was the year when the impossible became possible on Lansdowne Street. The Red Sox celebrated another title three years later, further burying their hard-luck loser legacy.Suddenly, the karmic pendulum is swinging the other way, as if the universe is trying to rebalance its portfolio.

Then came a 10-0 thumping in Texas, three losses in Toronto and three more at Tampa Bay. Last week, the Rays took three of four games at Fenway.

Now nothing seems assured except this: If the Red Sox miss the playoffs, it will be one of the greatest collapses in history.

Credit             Jim Rogash/Getty Images           Pitching, once a presumed strength, has been Boston’s undoing. As of Tuesday, the Red Sox ranked 21st in the majors with a 4.14 earned-run average, making them the only team in the bottom third with a chance to make the playoffs. They remain alive because of an offense that ranked No. 1 in runs scored (842) and batting average (.280) and was second in home runs (193).

John Lackey, in the second year of an $82 million contract, is 12-12 with a 6.49 ERA in 27 starts. In their desperation, the Red Sox recently turned to the rookie Kyle Weiland. He has given up 12 earned runs in 112/3 innings over three September starts.It is Lackey, however, who has caused the most consternation and angst. No one in the Red Sox’ 111 years has had a higher E.R.A. with a minimum of 150 innings, according to Sports Illustrated.

He was done in by one bad inning and one costly error. With two outs in the third, Vladimir Guerrero hit a deep line drive to right field that glanced off the glove of Josh Reddick, allowing Nick Markakis to score. Bedard walked the next two batters, and Mark Reynolds followed with a two-run single for a 4-1 lead.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “Misread it,” Reddick said of Guerrero’s liner. Reddick added, “It’s the worst feeling ever, knowing that you made your starting pitcher work a lot harder than he should have.”The bigger blow came in the eighth inning, when Papelbon gave up a bases-clearing two-out double to Robert Andino.

Pedroia and Reddick posed for photographs and tried on Flair’s massive championship belt.For a moment, it was as if the self-described “Idiots” of 2004 were roaming the room again.The surprise visit was a nice mood-enhancer and, in some odd way, an inspiration.

2  BOSTON (AP) — Robert Andino’s three-run double in the eighth inning gave the Baltimore Orioles a 7-5 win Tuesday night and ruined a chance for the Boston Red Sox to extend their two-game lead in the AL wild-card race. Andino’s go-ahead hit came off Jonathan Papelbon, who had gone 21 games since last allowing a run on July 16. It was his second blown save of the season and first since May 9, the last time he entered a game before the ninth inning. The Red Sox seemed headed for a three-game, wild-card lead over Tampa Bay, which lost to the New York Yankees 5-0 on Tuesday. But their struggles continued as they fell to 4-13 since leading the Rays by nine games on Sept. 3. Boston has seven games remaining and Tampa Bay has nine. Willie Eyre (2-1) got the win and Jim Johnson picked up his eighth save in 13 opportunities. Daniel Bard (2-9) had runners at first and second with one out when he was replaced by Papelbon. Papelbon, who had 28 strikeouts in the 21 scoreless outings, struck out Chris Davis for the second out. Then Nolan Reimold singled to short left field, loading the bases, and Andino doubled down the right-field line for his third hit of the game. The Red Sox wrap up a three-game series with the Orioles on Wednesday night before playing their last six on the road, three each against the New York Yankees and Baltimore. Adrian Gonzalez drove in three runs with a two-run homer and a double for the Red Sox. They went ahead 1-0 in the first on consecutive doubles by Dustin Pedroia and Gonzalez. But Baltimore scored four runs in the third when starter Erik Bedard threw 51 pitches and retired just two batters. With one out, Andino singled on a 13-pitch at-bat and scored on Nick Markakis’ two-out double. Vladimir Guerrero then hit a liner to right fielder Josh Reddick who misjudged it by taking a few steps in then had it go off his glove for a two-base error as he went back, allowing Markakis to score. After walks to Matt Wieters and Adam Jones loaded the bases, Mark Reynolds hit a two-run double. The Red Sox cut the lead to 4-3 in the third on a double by Pedroia and Gonzalez’s 27th homer of the season. They went ahead with two runs in the fourth, helped by an error. With no outs, Marco Scutaro walked, Jarrod Saltalamacchia singled and Mike Aviles singled in the tying run. Jacoby Ellsbury’s single loaded the bases. After Pedroia struck out, Gonzalez grounded to first baseman Reynolds, who threw home for the force then let the return throw go off his glove. That allowed Gonzalez, who was several feet from the base when the ball got to Reynolds, to reach safely and Aviles to score the tie-breaking run. (Copyright 2011 by The Associated Press.
