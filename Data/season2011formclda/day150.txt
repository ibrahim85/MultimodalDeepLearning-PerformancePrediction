The beginning, mercifully, was brief, a 5-13 start. Then, for more than half the season, the Mets went 50-38. That stretch took them through July 29, the day after they traded Carlos Beltran. Since then, they are 10 games under .500.So there is a lot of meat in the middle of that sandwich. But the taste, over all, still seems a little dry. Should fans be more hopeful now than they were when the season started? Trading Beltran to San Francisco for a top pitching prospect, Zack Wheeler, was a good sign. But Wheeler is in Class A.It would be different if a starting pitcher had emerged as something better than a No. 3 or 4, or the if Mets had discovered some solid relievers. Or if Jason Bay had produced the way he did before he signed. Or if any hitter, really, had stayed healthy enough to show what he could do for a full season.But none of that has happened. So the Mets are left with an intangible, which cannot be discounted, considering the shame of the last few seasons: the team, at least, plays hard. It is a reflection of Manager Terry Collins, who has handled his frustration gracefully. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The losing bothers Collins. He is famously fiery, as he showed years ago as the manager in Houston and in Anaheim. He vowed to be different at 62, promised not to base his happiness only on wins and losses. He said he would enjoy the experience and the challenge, and he has.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Collins is wise enough now to look deeper than the 62 wins and 68 defeats. And when he does, he is satisfied.“I’ve been fine,” Collins said Friday. “I’ve only had two or three meetings with these guys, and it’s never been about the effort. Therefore, it’s been O.K. Not happy with the results sometimes, but the effort has been there. Am I happy with the execution? Not always, but the effort has nothing to do with the execution side of it. The effort’s been there, and that’s all you can ask your players to do.”Collins is not Rex Ryan. He did not come to the Mets making bold predictions of championships. Instead, he told fans that although he could not predict how the Mets would finish, they would be proud to watch their team again. The Mets, he said, would be fun to watch.

They have dealt with more adversity than any team I’ve ever been around — unbelievable stuff, on and off the field — and they have maintained a sense of having something to prove.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Fans often latch on to overachieving teams and hold them dear. Think of the 1989 Baltimore Orioles, who hung in as surprise contenders all the way to the final weekend. Or the 1993 Philadelphia Phillies, a one-hit wonder that surged to the National League pennant and quickly went back to oblivion.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  These Mets have never seriously contended, and the depth of their talent lags far behind that of the Phillies and the Atlanta Braves. But only the truly heartless would wear bags over their heads at Citi Field anymore. It is unreasonable to expect more than what Collins has gotten from this team.

Privacy Policy    “I know one thing: had we stayed healthy, we’d have been playing for something right now,” Collins said. “We had a good club, we knew we had a good club, and that’s what ultimately you play for.“I don’t want to see anybody just say, ‘It’s over, the last thing I want to do is get hurt, so I’m just going to go out there and get my at-bats.’ I don’t play the game like that. We’re going to play the game hard. I want to see some character in this club going down the last 30 games. I don’t care who we play; we’re going to play the game right.”Collins defended the training staff and said some of the injuries — Ike Davis’s ankle sprain and bone bruise, the stress fracture in David Wright’s back — came on freak plays that could not have been avoided. Daniel Murphy’s inexperience at second base, Collins maintains, caused his knee injury.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Collins said his plan for the Mets’ best player, shortstop Jose Reyes, was to rest him more often when he is healthy, to limit the wear on his legs. Of course, the Mets have to re-sign Reyes first — at great cost, perhaps, and at great risk, for sure.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Without Reyes, Davis, Murphy and Beltran, Collins believes, the Mets’ pitchers have put too much pressure on themselves, trying to be so perfect that they fall behind in the count and get hit. The theory is plausible but impossible to verify.The San Francisco Giants, for example, score the fewest runs per game in the majors, but that has not stopped their pitchers from performing. The difference is, the Giants have high-end talent. The Mets have one elite pitcher, Johan Santana, but he has missed all season after shoulder surgery and is unlikely to return until next spring.“It’s hard this time of year,” Collins said. “But as I told them, sometimes adversity makes you stronger, and we’re going to face some next year. Every team does. But you’ll be able to get through it better because you’ve already been through it once.”  A version of this article appears in print on August 29, 2011, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Heads Held High On a Team Laid Low.

Granderson hit two home runs and knocked in four runs and the Yankees hit five home runs in all to account for all their runs.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Granderson hit a three-run shot in the third inning that gave the Yankees a 3-2 lead, and added a solo shot in the seventh to stretch the Yankees’ lead to 8-3. The latter was his 38th homer of the season and pushed him past Jose Bautista of the Toronto Blue Jays for the major league lead, an unusually high number for a player who stubbornly insists he is not a home run hitter.

On that day it was Swisher, Cano and Melky Cabrera, and it also came against the Orioles.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The power surge was a welcome return to form for the Yankees, who were shutout in the first game to lose for the fourth time in five games. They failed to get a runner to second base, and their inability to score meant an undeserved loss for Bartolo Colon, who pitched very well to counter the argument that he is fatigued from the increase in innings he has pitched this season.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Colon could not have pitched much better through the first six innings, when he allowed only two hits and faced just one batter over the minimum. With impeccable command of his fastball, and a sinker he threw more often and with more authority, as the Yankees had asked him to do, Colon pitched as well as he had in a month.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “He was able to throw the fastball wherever I put the glove,” Francisco Cervelli said.He allowed one run in the seventh and another in the eighth. In seven and two-thirds innings, he allowed two runs and seven hits. He also struck out four, but walked no one.In the seventh Nick Markakis doubled and Vladimir Guerrero hit a backdoor sinker to right field to drive in the first run of the game. The Orioles scored again in the eighth with the benefit of two softly hit singles.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The loss was Colon’s first this season in an afternoon start. His record in daytime starts is 6-1 with a 1.88 earned run average, which was why Girardi switched him with Nova.

Credit             Mitchell Layton/Getty Images           Girardi said before Sunday’s first game that he had hoped to reduce the starting rotation to five from six after A. J. Burnett’s next start Thursday against the Boston Red Sox, but gave no indication who might get the demotion. Burnett would be a likely candidate, considering his E.R.A. in August is 11.91 and he has looked terrible his last two outings.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  "We need him to pitch better, that’s the bottom line,” Girardi said, “So Thursday, or whatever day it is, is a big start.”Before Sunday there had also been some concern that Colon might be tiring as the season progressed considering he had already thrown more innings, 131, than he had in any season since 2005. Fatigue did not appear to be a problem Sunday.

Sometimes I’m going to get hit and sometimes I’m going to pitch the way I did today.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Nova pitched well, also, allowing three runs and seven hits over seven innings. But perhaps the best performance of the night belonged to relief pitcher David Robertson, who masterfully pitched his way out of a jam with the bases loaded and nobody out in the eighth.Robertson struck out Vladimir Guerrero, Mark Reynolds and Ryan Adams to get out of what could have been a game-altering inning. Robertson has now struck out 23 batters in his career in 45 at-bats with the bases loaded.Even in a game where power carried the Yankees to victory, it was a vital example of clutch pitching by Robertson to preserve a needed victory.

He had X-rays, which were negative, and Joe Girardi said the knee was really sore and Jeter would be questionable for Monday’s game against the Orioles. By playing in the first game Jeter passed Mickey Mantle for most games played by a Yankee, with 2,402.  “I’ve always taken pride in doing my job,” said Jeter, who played his first game for the Yankees in 1995. “I think that’s probably the best way to put it. My job is obviously to come and play games, try to stay on the field and try to stay healthy. I’ve done it for a long time.” Earlier this season Jeter became the first Yankee to collect 3,000 hits. ... Alex Rodriguez also did not play the second game because his sore left thumb was acting up. “Today it got a lot more sore than it necessarily had been in the last few days,” Girardi said. He was also questionable for Monday.
