Hard stuff, breaking stuff, slow stuff, trick stuff. Trick stuff was Phil Niekro’s knuckleball. He won 318 major league games by digging his fingernails into the seams of a ball and throwing it toward the plate as if he were pushing open a door. Trying to hit his knuckleball was like swatting at a fly with a straw.Slow stuff was a changeup like Christy Mathewson’s famous “fadeaway,” which was said to dissolve — poof! — as the batter swung. Or Stu Miller’s slow, slower and slowest changeups. Batters swore Miller didn’t throw the ball — he just put it on his arm and let his pulse carry it to the plate.Breaking stuff included a curveball, a slider and a screwball, pitches that radically changed direction as they approached the plate. The greatest curveballs (from Sandy Koufax, Nolan Ryan, Bert Blyleven, John Smoltz) were thrown hard and broke almost straight down. The Unfair One is what pitches like that were called. They were unhittable. A slider was a “nickel” curve with a short, sharp, last-second break. The Hall of Famer Steve Carlton had a slider that mimicked his fastball until the batter began his swing, then the ball darted six inches off the plate. A screwball was a reverse curveball. If the arm motion behind a curveball is akin to a man gracefully sweeping a woman into his arm, then a screwball requires the opposite: the pushing away of an assailant. There have been few great screwball pitchers (Fernando Valenzuela, Warren Spahn, Tug McGraw) because it’s so hard to master such an unnatural arm motion. The greatest screwballer was Carl Hubbell, who in the 1934 All Star game struck out Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin in succession. Hubbell’s left arm was so twisted that it hung by his side, his palm facing away from his body.Hard stuff was a fastball (Bob Feller, Sandy Koufax, Nolan Ryan) thrown near 100 m.p.h., and with movement. Koufax’s fastball seemed to rise from a batter’s waist to his eyes as the batter swung. Some great fastballs moved left, right, down — and some mediocre fastballs became great fastballs as they approached the plate and then, impossibly, seemed to pick up speed. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The greatest starting pitchers had at least one Unfair pitch, maybe two. Some great pitchers, like Whitey Ford and Spahn, never had an Unfair pitch but an assortment of excellent pitches instead.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The game has changed a lot since those days. But, as one pitching coach has said, “the game never changes to help pitchers.” That’s why today’s pitchers have been forced to evolve from predators to jackals. “Pitchers today don’t out-stuff hitters,” Buck Showalter, the Baltimore Orioles manager, says. Pitchers today are con men, pickpockets, masters of deception. Their weapons are small pitches: cutters, splitters, circle changeups.No team in baseball today has a greater number of successful deceptive pitchers than the Philadelphia Phillies. They have brought together four of the best starting pitchers in the game: Roy (Doc) Halladay, a 33-year-old two–time Cy Young Award winner; Cliff Lee, 32, and also a Cy Young winner; Roy Oswalt, 33, with 150 career wins; and the 27-year-old Cole Hamels, a World Series hero three years ago. Before they have even thrown one pitch for the same team, they are being hailed as the best four-man rotation in baseball, maybe the best ever. They are being compared with the great staffs in baseball history: the New York Yankees in the 1930s; the Cleveland Indians in 1954; the Orioles with their four 20-game winners in 1971; and the Atlanta Braves in the 1990s. As soon as Lee rejoined the team last December, the Phillies immediately became everyone’s favorite to win this year’s World Series. And necessity may push those expectations even higher now that the Phillies are dealing with injuries, most worryingly to their star second baseman and No. 3 hitter, Chase Utley, and must rely even more on their pitching.

Credit             Levon Biss for The New York Times           Last month I went to the Phillies’ spring-training camp in Clearwater, Fla., to see for myself how their star pitchers stacked up against my idols from back in the day. I went straight to Greg Casterioto, the media guy, for my credentials. He laid down the ground rules. I couldn’t approach any of them at their lockers, in the weight room or on the field until he had spoken to them about an interview. Not even to say hello. He said the three older pitchers were nonverbal and gruff because they felt talking about their pitching might jinx it. Halladay, in particular, was very focused, always in some psychic zone that excluded others. “He works out at 5 a.m. for five hours before practice,” Casterioto said.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Every morning I checked the bulletin board to see who was throwing a bullpen session under the watchful eyes of Rich Dubee, the Phillies’ pitching coach. When Halladay’s name appeared, I asked Dubee what time Halladay would throw. “Whenever,” he said. Dubee had an ineffectual minor league career before becoming a pitching coach. He said the hardest part of his job was “to stay out of their way and not screw it up.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  I stood behind Halladay while he threw. Despite his size, 6-foot-6, 230 pounds, and his grizzled, unshaven face, he was less than fearsome. His father once said his son had the nature of an amiable golden retriever. But he throws like a vulture, all flapping arms and lunging body. His pitches hit the catcher’s mitt with the sound of a ball thrown into a bale of cotton. Halladay never throws a straight pitch that his catcher can catch flush or a batter can hit solidly. His cutter darts away from a right-handed hitter, his fastball has a little tail into a right-handed hitter and his sinker drops straight down. Unlike most pitchers, Halladay doesn’t throw directly at the corners of the plate. He aims at the middle and lets the pitches break left, right, or down off the plate. All his pitches look like strikes, until they aren’t.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Halladay regularly leads the majors in complete games, averaging greater than five a year. Which is an example of how far the bar has been lowered for greatness since back in the day. Spahn averaged 21 complete games a season from age 26 until he was 42 in 1963. Spahn also won 20 or more games in 13 seasons. Even more recent pitchers, like Jim Palmer, who was a part of that Orioles rotation in 1971, regularly completed 20 games per season. During one nine-year period, Palmer won 20 games eight times.Everyone I talked to said the same impressive things about Halladay. A pitching coach said, “On a good day Doc is dangerous, and on a bad day he’s still dangerous.” Palmer, who now works as a broadcaster for the Orioles, called Halladay “Greg Maddux with better stuff,” referring to the four-time Cy Young Award winner who pitched for the Braves in the ’90s. Ryan Howard, the Phillies’ slugging first baseman, told me, “Doc’s sinker is probably unhittable.” John Farrell, the manager for the Toronto Blue Jays, Halladay’s first team, said: “If he mistakenly throws a pitch over the middle, you can’t miss it. But then again, his pitches over the middle don’t end up over the middle.”The next morning I watched Hamels throw. He’s tall, 6-foot-3, but he looks soft, a surfer dude from San Diego with a shock of black hair falling over his handsome face. He has a decent four-seam fastball that doesn’t move much, but it has, according to Pat Gillick, the former general manager of the Blue Jays and Phillies, “a late giddyap.” His curveball, without an abrupt break, is merely adequate. It’s his changeup that has made him an excellent pitcher. Years ago, a starting pitcher’s changeup was his third or fourth pitch. Today, for a lot of pitchers, the changeup is their Unfair One. It’s called a circle change. The pitcher spreads his last three fingers around the ball, then forms a little circle with his forefinger and thumb on the side of the ball. Then he just throws a fastball and his grip prevents it from going fast. The best circle changes, like the one thrown by Hamels, either seem to die at the plate or fade away from a right-handed batter like a soft cutter. It’s a deceptive pitch, easier to master than to hit. Tom Glavine, another smooth southpaw — are there any other kind? — used his deceptive changeup to win 305 games, most of them with the Braves from 1987 through 2002. “Hamels is a Glavine,” Palmer told me, “but with a better fastball and less control.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  According to Mike Arbuckle, the Phillies’ scouting director in 2002, when the Phillies drafted Hamels out of high school, Hamels “was very polished, his changeup was very advanced, but his curve had no bite.” Gillick said Hamels used to have a good curveball, but “he lost confidence in it because he had so much confidence in his change as his out pitch.” Ryan Howard said of Hamels’s changeup: “Devastating, but his curveball is whatever. But sometimes your third pitch can be your best first pitch.” What he meant is that so many hitters are looking for Hamels to throw a first-pitch changeup that a curveball will often catch them flat-footed taking the pitch.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  A pitching coach told me: “Hamels makes mistakes. He’s not strong like Doc either. A few years ago he was the It guy after he was the World Series M.V.P. in 2008. But he started appearing everywhere.” In other words, Hamels became a celebrity beyond baseball. He appeared on “Late Show With David Letterman” and “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” with his wife, Heidi Strobel, a reality-TV veteran from “Survivor.” Hamels transformed from a laid-back kid from San Diego in O.P. shorts into a slickster in Hugo Boss suits with a buffed, boyish charm. His teammates began calling him Hollywood Hamels.

Eventually he admitted “these side jobs” were wearing him out and getting in the way of his real job, which was playing winning baseball.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  After four days, I was getting antsy. No interviews, no word from Casterioto. So I approached Halladay at his locker one morning. He turned his back and muttered, “Talk to Greg.” I went over to Hamels at his locker. Before I could speak, he brushed past me: “I’m busy.”I looked around and saw Oswalt at his locker. What the hell! He looked up without expression and said, “O.K., let’s do it now.” We went outside and sat on a bench and talked.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Oswalt is often described as “a slender six-footer.” In Gillick’s words: “If you like him as a pitcher, he’s a six-footer. If not, he’s 5-foot-10.” He looks smaller, barely 160 pounds. But, as Palmer put it to me, “he pitches like a big man.”Oswalt said he was smaller as a kid: “I had to use my body more to throw hard.” He drives off the mound with his legs low to the ground, which propels his fastball upward of 95 m.p.h. He considers himself a classic “old school” pitcher: overhand fastball, curveball, with a change as a third pitch. “I’m aggressive,” he said. “I throw strikes and pitch to my strength, not a hitter’s weakness.” If a hitter likes high inside fastballs and that’s Oswalt’s best pitch, he’ll challenge the hitter mano a mano. Nolan Ryan told me, “He’s very confident, but he throws his fastball up more than I’m comfortable with.” Mike Maddux, Texas’ pitching coach, said: “He’s cocksure, very aggressive. The knock against him is he’s only a fastball pitcher. But he has a big-time curve too.” Ryan Howard told me that Oswalt’s curve is not even 70 m.p.h., “but it’s got a hump in it. You get anxious, you go at it too soon. Then he comes back at you with that 94 m.p.h. fastball on the hands. Oh, man.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Oswalt said that no one throws a curveball much anymore. “It’s too hard to learn, and umpires don’t like to call it a strike.” A great overhand curveball drops from a batter’s waist to his knees as it crosses the plate, and is caught by a catcher before it hits the dirt. A great curveball never looks like a strike. Umpires don’t like to be embarrassed in front of 50,000 people. “If a guy doesn’t come into the big leagues with a curveball, it’s hard to teach him a quality one,” Dubee told me. “You either can spin it right away or you can’t.” A curveball begins with a fastball arm motion, the pitcher’s arm passing his head with his two fingers cutting through the center of the ball and aimed directly at the plate. When the pitcher’s hand is in front of his head, just before he releases the ball, he must roll his two fingers over the top of the ball to give it downward spin, while simultaneously pulling his arm sharply in toward his opposite hip. The motion is akin to pulling on the string hanging from an overhead light bulb. A great curveball is the only pitch that requires two different arm motions in one pitch.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Oswalt throws between starts more than he works out in a gym. He gave me a sly, sideways grin. “I don’t get to the gym at 5 a.m. and work out for five hours. That’s ungodly.” Oswalt went on to say that “guys used to throw 300 innings a year,” but 200 is a lot today. “Now there’s pitch counts. Who came up with the magic number, 100 pitches and take him out? You don’t hurt your arm throwing in the ninth inning — you hurt it in the early innings before your throwing smooths out.”Mel Queen, a player-development consultant for the Blue Jays, told me that the kiss of death for today’s pitchers is the “quality start”: seven innings and turn the game over to the setup man and then the closer. He said babying young pitchers to protect a team’s investment in them has made many of them soft, like Joba Chamberlain of the Yankees. “Joba looks confused now,” Queen said, “because he hasn’t pitched enough in the minors.” Mike Maddux told me: “My icons were Palmer, Seaver and Ryan. They took responsibility for finishing a game. That’s why pitchers don’t have the variety of pitches today that they used to.” He meant that today’s starting pitchers don’t need as many good pitches, or the Unfair One, to go seven innings as they do to finish to nine. It’s that third and even fourth time through the opposition’s batting order that dooms most of today’s starting pitchers. It’s something of a fallacy that today’s starting pitchers don’t complete games simply because they lack the stamina, or because teams fear injury. Starting pitchers today don’t have the quality or variety of pitches, the depth of talent, required to go nine innings.

But baseball strategy has changed, and “the name of the game is just to go seven innings. Young pitchers never find out where their heart is until they’ve been tested over nine innings.” Seaver, who completed 231 games during his career, told me, “If I was a manager today, I’d go out to the mound in the seventh when a pitcher was in trouble and tell him, ‘I’m not coming back.’ ”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  I asked Oswalt how he would adjust to the loss of his stuff as he got older. He laughed and said: “I have a great knuckleball. I’ll break it out later in my career.” Oswalt is like most successful pitchers today who are reluctant to tamper with the stuff that made them successful, until they lose it. Most great pitchers don’t wait until they lose their stuff before they redefine themselves as pitchers. Spahn began tinkering with a screwball and slider when he was still winning 20 games a season in his 20s. By the time he began to lose his good fastball and sharp-breaking curveball, in his early 30s, he had already incorporated his new pitches into his repertory, which is why he continued winning 20 games a year into his 40s.The following morning, Casterioto told me Halladay would talk to me at 8:30 by his locker. I went over, and we talked. As a pitcher, he said, “I have to work hard to throw hard because I was never a nice, easy, fluid thrower.” That’s why he’s so dedicated to his obsessive workouts: “It makes me feel stronger and more confident. It’s the mental part of pitching I worry about. I have to remind myself don’t think too much.” (According to Queen, Halladay can’t remember the last thing you told him. “You put too much in his head, and nothing sticks.”) [{"headline":"The New York Times Magazine","summary":"The best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week, including exclusive feature stories, photography, columns and more.","product-code":"MA","product-title":"The New York Times Magazine","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/magazine?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=MA&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"Morning Briefing","summary":"Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.","product-code":"NN","product-title":"Morning Briefing","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/newsletters\/sample\/morning-briefing?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=NN&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"},{"headline":"NYT Living","summary":"Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.","product-code":"LI","product-title":"NYT Living","sample-url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/pages\/nytliving\/nytliving-email\/index.html?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=LI&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up"}]      Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Privacy Policy    When Halladay was drafted by Toronto in ’95, he was a big, hard-throwing overhand fastball-curveball pitcher like Nolan Ryan, but with less explosive stuff. Then, in his second full season with the Blue Jays, in 2000, he lost his control, his stuff and his confidence. He posted a 10.64 E.R.A., the worst of any pitcher who pitched at least 50 innings in a single season. The Jays sent him down to the minors, where he came under the spell of Queen. Queen called him “weak” and “worthless,” and Halladay agreed. Then Queen made a few simple changes to Halladay’s motion. He lowered Halladay’s arm motion from straight overhand to low-three-quarters overhand, then taught him various grips to make his fastball move. “The rest is history,” Queen told me. Two years later, Halladay was a 19-game winner. He has won at least 20 games in a season three times.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Of his disastrous meltdown in 2000, Halladay said: “It wasn’t that I was afraid. I was confused. I didn’t know what the problem was or how to turn it around.” Queen helped him physically. Mentally, he learned a lot from Harvey Dorfman’s book, “The Mental ABC’s of Pitching.” Dorfman has become a psychological guru for confused pitchers. His book is full of simplicities cloaked in athletic jargon that comforts pitchers who have never thought much about their craft. (Seaver always had his own theories about pitching.) Sample advice from Dorfman: “Address failure by defining it in situational terms, rather than personal ones. In other words, be certain perspective is clear.”I left Halladay and went to watch Joe Blanton pitch batting practice. Blanton is the Phillies’ fifth starter. He’s being paid a lot of money to be the forgotten man: $8.5 million a year compared with Halladay’s $20 million, Oswalt’s $16 million, Lee’s $11 million ($21.5 million starting next year) and Hamels’s $9.5 million. Blanton throws with an extreme, short-arm motion, a short stride, a stand-up follow through, like a Little League pitcher who has never been coached. Still, he has a darting fastball and a sharp slider.Then I saw Lee throwing off a bullpen mound with Dubee and abandoned Blanton. Dubee glanced at me as if annoyed. At 6-foot-3, Lee is tall and lean like a knife blade, with a club fighter’s big jaw. Carl Willis, his coach at Cleveland, once said if he was ever in a bar fight, he’d want Lee on his side because “you’d have to kill him” to stop him. Lee has something of a temper. In 2007, pitching for the Indians, he hit Sammy Sosa in the head with a fastball on a night the Rangers were honoring Sosa for hitting 600 home runs. The same game, Lee got into two arguments with his catcher in full view of the fans. Willis says Lee can be stubborn. Others have called him colorless and “not especially eloquent or intellectual,” a man who admits to having never read a book.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Lee may have the temperament of a bar fighter, but as a pitcher he’s as precise as a surgeon. He dices and slices batters with his delicately placed fastballs. Last season, he walked 18 batters in 212 innings. “I wish he’d throw more balls,” Gillick said. Lee can be predictable with his four-seam fastball, which doesn’t move much at 92 to 94 m.p.h. He throws as many as 90 fastballs a game, most of them to one spot, low and inside to right handers. When his control is off, Lee, unlike Halladay, can be hit. Last year in the World Series with the Texas Rangers, Lee was roughed up by the San Francisco Giants in two games, giving up nine earned runs and 14 hits in 11.2 innings because, according to Willis, “his fastball migrated to the middle of the plate,” where it was hittable.

When he raises his right leg so high that his knee is almost to his face, he draws his arm back with the ball. He doesn’t bring the ball all the way behind him, as most pitchers do, their arms extended so far behind them that the hitter can pick up the ball and follow its progress. Lee “short arms” the ball instead, pulling his arm back alongside his body, as if he were cocking an AK-47, which keeps the ball hidden.

He has the same great delivery every pitch. He’s a machine. The ball goes to the same spot every time.” He’s like a dart thrower, focused on one spot where he throws his four-seam fastball and cutter. He has a decent circle change too, and a good one-knuckle curveball that he doesn’t throw much because he doesn’t have confidence in it.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Lee bounced six consecutive curveballs in the dirt, then abandoned it for his pinpoint fastball, his comfort zone. “Oh, I love it!” Dubee said.When I asked Nolan Ryan about Lee’s fastball, he said: “Well, he throws a lot of them. But I wouldn’t rave about it.” (Lee spurned the Rangers, where Ryan is an owner and the president, to rejoin the Phillies, for whom he pitched in the second half of the 2009 season.) Gillick said, “If I was a hitter, I’d uncork on that inside pitch.” Mike Schmidt, a Hall of Famer and a former third baseman with the Phillies, where he is now a hitting instructor, said, “I might be able to hit that pitch.” He added that he might be able to hit Halladay’s moving fastball too. “I’d just look for a ball away,” he said, “and let everything else go.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  After watching Lee throw, I followed him into the clubhouse and introduced myself. He looked at me with cold eyes, then said, “Tomorrow morning, 7:30.” The following morning, I sat down at the outside bench at 7 o’clock. At 8, I stood up and walked over to the open doors of the weight room. I saw Lee pedaling a stationary bike. I waited until he finished and followed him into the clubhouse. “I’m busy,” he said. “Tomorrow.”I saw Hamels by his locker, so I went over to him. “O.K.,” he said. “I’ve got a few minutes.” Hamels was charming, voluble, self-deprecating. He told me that when he was a high-school pitcher in San Diego, the competition was so tough that he couldn’t just throw a fastball, even if it was 95 m.p.h. “So I picked up a circle change,” he said. He showed me how he held the ball. It’s such a deceptive pitch for him now that at times, he said, “a guy will swing so hard and miss it, his helmet will come off.” He laughed. “One guy threw up his arms and said, ‘That’s not fair.’ ”I told him the knock against him was that when he was in trouble, batters looked for his change. “Definitely true,” he admitted. “I used to always go to my strength, but now I’ll go to a batter’s weakness too . . . unless it’s a curveball.” He smiled. “No, no, no way I’ll throw a curve in a clutch situation. I’ll throw my cutter.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The cut fastball, popularized by the Yankees’ brilliant closer, Mariano Rivera, approaches the plate like an easy-to-hit fastball; then, as the batter begins his swing, it cuts in on his hands, or away. The cutter is a poor man’s slider. It breaks later and less than a slider and is much easier to learn to throw. A slider is thrown hard, with a locked wrist, almost like throwing a football, with the pitcher’s hand slightly cocked off-center so that his fingers cut through the left or right half of the ball. If those fingers rotate too much around the ball, the slider will soften, slow, break too much and become a sloppy, hittable curveball. The less a ball breaks, the easier it is to control. A cutter can be thrown with confidence when the pitcher is behind the batter in the count, say, 3 and 1. Young pitchers are taught a cutter early today so they don’t struggle learning a curveball. Cutters, splitters and changes are just variations on a fastball. They rely simply on gripping a ball in different ways and then throwing it like a fastball.

When we finished, he flashed me his charming, boyish smile, scissored his hair off his brow and said, “Thank you so much, and have a wonderful day!”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Eventually I cornered Lee at his locker. I asked him how he developed that southpaw’s motion of his. “What do you mean by that?” he said. I said, “It’s a beautiful motion.” He said: “Oh. I had a lot of coaches.” He referred to his fastball as his “go-to” pitch. Then, defensively, he added: “That’s not the only pitch I throw, you know. My game is locating. If I’m hitting my spots, I’ve got stuff and control. If not, I’ve lost both.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  I asked which batters gave him the most trouble. Punchy hitters, he said, who foul off a lot of pitches, then slap the ball the other way. “Like Ichiro,” he said. “Sometimes you just want to let him hit his ground ball and hope someone catches it. He’s gonna get his hits. The quicker he does, the better for me. The more pitches a batter sees, the better hitters they become.” All four Phillies’ pitchers prefer to face free-swinging home-run hitters — those with “a lot of air in their swing to make them miss,” in Oswalt’s words. Pitchers who rely on one favorite pitch, instead of a variety of pitches, always lose effectiveness the more pitches they throw to a batter. Spahn often set up a batter by deliberately getting behind in the count 2-0, so the batter started looking for a fat pitch. That’s when Spahn went to work on him with his screwball, slider and big curve.I asked Lee if he pitched to his strength or a batter’s weakness. He said: “If a hitter’s looking for a fastball inside, that doesn’t mean I won’t throw it. You don’t abandon your best pitch because a guy likes it.” Why doesn’t he throw more curveballs? He said, “It’s the hardest pitch to locate.” In fact Lee had his worst year in the majors in 2007 (5-8, 6.29 E.R.A.), when he tried to master a slider. “I focused so much on it,” he said, “it got me in trouble. Some guys put a lot of pressure on themselves because they think they gotta be more than they are.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  As I left, he said, “Sorry it took so long.”After more than a week, I formulated my opinion about what made these four pitchers successful. A deceptive pitch, great control and the need to stay within the boundaries of their talent. If they strayed too far from those boundaries, they feared that might destroy their success. This has made them very good pitchers, maybe even great pitchers in the game today. But in that pantheon of great pitchers throughout history, they seemed merely one-trick ponies in an age of diminished expectations of greatness. A harsh judgment? Possibly. So before I left the Phillies, I talked to one more man.Mike Schmidt was standing behind a batting cage, still as trim as during his playing days. A handsome, middle-aged man with swept-back, silvery hair and a thick mustache. I asked him what he thought of the four Phillies pitchers  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “Well,” he said, “now when the Phillies come to town, the other team knows they’re being challenged by four No. 1 pitchers. They have to amp up their mental game. I used to see my at-bats the night before a game when I laid my head down on the pillow. Gibson, Seaver, Ryan. I had to have a plan. When I went to Houston, they had three good pitchers. The fourth was Nolan Ryan. I could go to sleep with the other three, but Ryan kept me awake. Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! My plan was, don’t miss his fastball if he threw it over the plate. If he got two strikes on me, I’d have to face his curveball.” He turned and looked at me with his small blue eyes, which had fear in them. “Ryan was scary!” he said. He shook his head, as if seeing Ryan on the mound. Ryan began his motion and fired the ball at his head. Schmidt had a split second to make a decision. Was it a 100 m.p.h. fastball that could kill him if it hit him in the head, or was it that wicked curveball? If he dove away from the plate and the pitch was a curveball that broke over the plate, he’d look like a fool and a coward. But if it wasn’t a curveball, if it was that 100 m.p.h. fastball, and he didn’t dive away from the plate . . . well, he didn’t even want to think about that.“Ryan, Gibson, Seaver, they made you defensive,” he said. “Does that make sense? You were afraid of the ball. There’s no fear of the ball today with cutters, splitters and changeups.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “What about the Phillies’ four pitchers?” I said.“They’re not scary,” he said. “Even if they all win 20 games, the Phillies don’t have a pitcher who strikes fear in a hitter.”   Correction: April 17, 2011   An article on April 3 about this year’s starting pitchers for the  Philadelphia Phillies, which included comparisons with the greatest  pitchers of all time, misstated the pitching arm of the Hall of Famer  Carl Hubbell.
