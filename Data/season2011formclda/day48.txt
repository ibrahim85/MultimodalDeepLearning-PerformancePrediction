C. Sabathia reached the majors at age 20, with the Cleveland Indians in 2001. The team was bound for the playoffs, with Bartolo Colon as its ace. Sabathia watched Colon and saw a template for the kind of pitcher he wanted to be.“He gives you everything he’s got every time out,” Sabathia, reunited with Colon this season on the Yankees, said Wednesday. “That was something I admired about him back then, and he’s the same way now. But I think he has more fun doing it now than he did back when I played with him earlier. He just doesn’t look stressed at all. He just goes out and makes pitches.”Colon did that Wednesday, blanking the Baltimore Orioles for eight innings of a 4-1 win in 15 innings at Camden Yards. Sabathia, the staff anchor, will start on Thursday before a weekend series with the Mets.Sabathia is one of three Yankees in their primes, with Robinson Cano and Mark Teixeira. On Wednesday, Cano drilled the go-ahead double in the 15th, four innings after Teixeira’s game-saving stop of a wild throw. Their performance carries the team and their presence carries the clubhouse, even if the more compelling story lines concern the uncomfortable fades of Derek Jeter and Jorge Posada — and perhaps, someday, of Mariano Rivera and Alex Rodriguez. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The Yankees invested $341 million in Sabathia and Teixeira after failing to reach the playoffs in 2008. For a team that makes a lot of excessive purchases — most recently reliever Rafael Soriano — the Yankees spent wisely that time, signing star players who also lead.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “It’s his dynamic personality,” Teixeira said, alluding to Sabathia. “C. C.’s always joking around, he’s always having fun, but when it comes to playing the game, he does everything right. So he leads by example on the field, and then when he’s in the clubhouse, guys just love being around him.”Sabathia and Teixeira helped the Yankees win the World Series in their first season, the kind of instant success that minted Jeter in 1996, when he did the same. Jeter was a natural to be the team captain, a position George Steinbrenner bestowed in 2003, and he has handled the title with grace.Jeter will always symbolize the dynasty years — Posada and Rivera, too — and he stands for the competitive mind-set that defined Steinbrenner: winning it all is the only acceptable outcome. There is value in that, but someday the Yankees will not be his team anymore.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  That has never seemed more apparent than it has this week, when the Yankees rebuked Jeter for publicly supporting Posada, his close friend, after Posada’s refusal to play last Saturday. Jeter’s support was predictable, and Posada may have misled him on the details. But Jeter still came off as tone-deaf to some in the front office, who were startled by how much he just didn’t get it.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The whole episode underscores the way the front office seems to view the team, symbolically divided between old and new. The clubhouse itself is cohesive, said Sabathia, who grimaced at the notion that any tensions would have to be smoothed over.

I think we have a good chemistry. We started spring training that way, and it’s kind of carried over to the season.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  He continued: “Everything outside that you see on TV, you can’t control that stuff. I don’t think it bothers anybody in here, with us being a veteran ball club.”Sabathia spent his first eight seasons in Cleveland and Milwaukee, far from the news media spotlight, and he viewed New York through the national lens: staid, corporate players trying not to be suffocated by a frenzied environment.“It’s 100 percent different,” he said. “If people could be around us, the perception outside looking in is totally different than what it is in here, how loose and how much fun we have, how much we all get along. Outside looking in, you don’t see all that. You don’t see the interaction; you just see the big names. But my Yankee experience has been great. I wouldn’t change it for anything in the world.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Sabathia, who turns 31 in July, will have a chance to change it after the season if he exercises an opt-out clause and becomes a free agent. With four years left on his contract, Sabathia will have leverage on the Yankees, who should make a two-year extension their first off-season priority.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Sabathia has been uneven this season — 3-3 with a 3.47 earned run average — but he may be the most indispensable Yankee. Think about the starters in the American League East. Would any Yankee besides Sabathia rank in the top 10? Possibly not, though Colon made a strong case Wednesday.In Cleveland, Colon ceded the No. 1 spot in the rotation to Sabathia when he was traded in 2002. Sabathia said he was probably too young for the job, but it speeded his development.“My very first year, I was just trying to survive games,” he said. “Now I want to go out and command and dominate games.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Those games belong to Sabathia.

3 View photosFabio Chumpitaz, left, and his four-year-old daughter Jasmin, watch as Fenway Park baseball park empties out following an announcement that the Boston Red Sox's game against the Baltimore Orioles was postponed due to rain, in Boston, Tuesday, May 17, 2011. MoreA rainout gave the Baltimore Orioles an extra 24 hours before making moves to replenish their banged-up roster.Their game against the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday night was postponed because of rain. Had the game started, the Orioles would have placed first baseman Derrek Lee and infielder Cesar Izturis on the disabled list and officially recalled first baseman Brandon Snyder and pitcher Troy Patton from Norfolk of the International League.The Red Sox made the announcement about the rainout shortly before the game was scheduled to start as rain created puddles on the tarp covering the infield. Temperatures were in the high 40s and dropping. No makeup date was immediately announced.Both Snyder and Patton were at Fenway Park for the game — with Patton on hand in case the game started and starter Zach Britton been forced to leave because of a rain delay. Because of the rainout, neither was activated and only Snyder is expected to be added Wednesday, when Baltimore is expected to add a position player, perhaps outfielder Nolan Reimold.Lee suffered a strained left oblique in Monday night's game, while Izturis has a nerve problem in his right elbow that led to numbness in his throwing hand. He went back to Baltimore on Monday to see team orthopedist Dr. John Wilckens."Izzy will go on the DL, but we've got 24 hours to think about Lee," manager Buck Showalter said after the rainout was announced. "We've got another day to look at it to see if there's any drastic improvement."Jake Fox was in the posted lineup for Tuesday night's washout, but left fielder Luke Scott could wind up at first base, depending on what roster moves are made.Lee, off to a slow start offensively, was "very quietly starting to come on," Showalter said. "The one constant he's given us is he's a run reducer (defensively) as much as a run producer."Right-hander Chris Tillman, forced to leave Monday night's start after five scoreless innings because of back stiffness, was OK on Tuesday. The Orioles blew a 6-0 lead after Tillman left and wound up losing 8-7.Showalter said his club would "probably stay in turn" in the rotation the next two games with Britton and Jeremy Guthrie staying in the same order, adding he would use the flight back to Baltimore to talk to pitching coach Mark Connor about what comes after that.Guthrie, set to start the opener of a two-game series with the Yankees on Wednesday night, was sent ahead by the team before last night's game."We might beat Guthrie home," Showalter said. "We put him on a 7 o'clock flight."But the rest of the Orioles were forced to wait some two hours for their charter, which had weather delays.The Orioles, who have already made up one rainout with a home double-header against Texas, also have two others to make up, both against the Yankees. They will host New York in a day-night twinbill Aug. 27. But while the Yankees announced the teams will play a pair in New York July 30, the Orioles have yet to agree on a date.

St. Joseph graduate, Teixeira, 31, is a native of Severna Park. But his hometown roots only served to anger fans when he signed with New York, a team O's fans dub the "evil empire." In an interview with b, Teixeira talked about his acrimonious relationship with local fans, the best place to get a crab cake and his charity work. You've been involved with charities in Atlanta, Baltimore and now East Harlem, where you pledged $1 million to help Harlem RBI, a baseball and academics program, build a facility for DREAM Charter School. What do you find rewarding about working with Harlem RBI?  var adSkipCounter = 0; The kids that we help, we're really changing their lives. A lot of them grow up in very tough situations at home and at school. A lot of these kids wouldn't have the opportunity to succeed if it wasn't for Harlem RBI. There's a high school player at John Carroll named K.J. Hockaday who is challenging your MIAA single-season home run record of 29. Have you been following that? [Hockaday broke the record shortly after this interview.]I was unaware my record still stood. I'd be excited if somebody broke it. That'd be neat. You've been known as a slow starter. But this season you've started out fast, on pace for close to 40 home runs. To what do you attribute that? A lot of it is my workout routine. I always lift weights very heavy and spend a lot of time in the weight room. I think because of that I start the season a little stiff, a little tight and maybe even a little tired because of the extra work I put in. What I did this spring training was lower my amount of time in the weight room, and increase my amount of time in the batting cage and I think that really helped. Do you think you were too muscle-bound when you started previous seasons? A little bit. It's kind of a double-edged sword. It allows me to stay strong all year, which is great, and I always end up having great second halves. It holds me back in the beginning of the year. I'm trying to find that balance this year where I can get off to a good start but also stay strong throughout the season. What do you think of the O's this season?We have a very difficult division. I really like their young players that are coming up. They have a lot of talent that's producing at the big league level right now, and I hear some of their guys in the minor leagues are also ready to break out and be stars in the future. The Orioles definitely have a bright future. Which Orioles pitcher are Yankees hitters most worried about facing? We faced Zach Britton twice in spring training and I was really impressed. I know he's a young kid and he's already done real well at the big league level. The guy I would keep my eye on as a possible 20-game winner, a possible Cy Young candidate in the future, is Zach Britton. Baltimore fans accused you of turning your back when you signed with the Yankees in '09. Has that relationship improved with time? I'm a Baltimore guy. I've always loved Baltimore and always will love Baltimore, but baseball is baseball, and when you're playing on the opposing team, you're going to get booed. The day I stop getting booed in opposing parks, I'm probably on the bench and not playing that well. At the same time, it's unfortunate that some Oriole fans take it personal that I didn't sign with the Orioles. Of the five offers I received, the Orioles were by far the lowest offer and I don't know if they were ever that serious about signing me. We had one meeting and that was it. I'm not sure if they were ever very interested. Do you ever see yourself becoming an Oriole in the future? I'm going to end my career as a Yankee. I'm only in the third year of this contract. It's an eight-year contract. I love being a Yankee and it's hard not to. It's a special place to play. I know you're a big reader. What are you reading right now and what are your favorite baseball books? I just finished Mickey Mantle's book, "The Last Boy." I really enjoy reading biographies and books about figures in America who really transformed culture and were really iconic figures. I really enjoyed Joe DiMaggio's book, "A Hero's Life," and Lou Gehrig's book, "The Luckiest Man." When you're back in Maryland, where's your favorite place to eat? Being from Baltimore, I'm a crab cake snob and I'm very particular on where I eat my crab cakes. To me, G&M;'s is the best you can get in the area. I'm looking forward to having crabs over my parents' house. You sit on the back porch on a nice night. Put the newspaper out on the table and just crack crabs for three or four hours and hang out with my family and friends. I love being able to reach out to my Baltimore fans. I think they have an interesting relationship with me. I hope they know it's not personal. It's the way it is. I'll always love Baltimore. It's always going to be my home. Luke Broadwater is managing editor at b.

It's such a good division that the Yankees' $203 million payroll does not guarantee them a spot in the playoffs. var adSkipCounter = 0; The Rays' young pitching is a real threat to the Yankees and Red Sox in terms of the East title, and the strength of the Blue Jays and Orioles could make it hard for the East runner-up to pile up victories, meaning the wild card might be found elsewhere.The East has advanced two teams 12 of 16 seasons in the wild-card era, but this year it might be too strong for its own good.progers@tribune.comNo change at topJoseph MoskowitzMorning CallThe mix of the old-school baseball persona and new-school raw power makes the AL East the toughest division in baseball — still. The Yankees and Red Sox haven't had stellar starts, but with Cy Young-caliber pitching and power at nearly every spot in the lineup, it is only a matter of time before the two ticking-time bombs explode.The Rays lead the division behind the arm of James Shields and the surprising bat of Matt Joyce. Even traditional lightweights — the Orioles and Blue Jays — are pulling their weight. The O's are flirting with .500; and the Jays are battling the Yanks and Sox for second place.None of these teams likely will hold baseball's best record at season's end, but that's only because the division is so tough.jmoskowitz@tribune.comNL East topsDom AmoreHartford CourantIf starting pitching is baseball's most important element, then one might begin and end this debate with Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, Josh Johnson and Jair Jurrjens. Why wait for Johan Santana and Stephen Strasburg to get healthy?The NL East is baseball's best division at the moment. Its teams are 55-36 outside the division — even the Mets are 8-8. The AL East, the perennial favorite here, has not yet lived up to its 2011 billing. Its teams are 62-54 against the other divisions, but the Red Sox's tough start indicates that the East might not be as dominant as it has been in past years.In the NL East, the Phillies have established a fearsome foursome in Halladay, Lee, Cole Hamels and Roy Oswalt. Yet they hardly are running away with the division — so good are the Braves and Marlins. This is going to be MLB's toughest race.damore@tribune.comWhere the money isMike DiGiovannaLos Angeles TimesThe offensive firepower of the Yankees and Red Sox and the superior rotation of the Rays make the American League East the toughest division in baseball, though the National League East, with excellent teams in the Phillies, Marlins and Braves, is gaining ground.What gives the AL East the edge is the seemingly endless financial resources of the Yankees and Red Sox.
