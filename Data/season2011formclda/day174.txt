The Yankees are the all-purpose safety net, providing Boston a cushion in the wild-card race by repeatedly beating the Tampa Bay Rays.With Beckett on the mound Wednesday, and the Yankees playing Tampa Bay twice, it should have been a gratifying night in Boston. Instead, it was another day of conflicting emotions, and mostly anguish.The Yankees did their part, sweeping the Rays in a doubleheader in New York. But Beckett, Boston’s ace, took a misstep late in the evening and veered into the Red Sox’ vortex of despair.

The Red Sox, who began September in first place, head to Yankee Stadium this weekend for a three-game series that could determine whether they make the playoffs, or complete one of the worst collapses in baseball history.

Privacy Policy    The September slump has done strange things to the Boston psyche, turning everyone into a temporary Yankees fan. In the afternoon, several players watched the Yankees and the Rays on the clubhouse television. Josh Reddick cheered Eduardo Nunez’s game-tying home run, and Ortiz exulted at Robinson Cano’s tie-breaking double — then sheepishly acknowledged the absolute weirdness of cheering for the Yankees.By the time that game ended, the Red Sox had dispersed, having turned their focus to their own challenges.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Prior to Wednesday, Boston’s starters had pitched into the sixth inning just five times in 20 games, taxing the bullpen and placing undue pressure on everyone. Manager Terry Francona conceded that some of the Red Sox’ recent miscues might be a product of players pressing.“Sometimes guys try to do too much,” said Francona, who at another point noted, “I think the one thing you need to do is fight the frustration — like, ‘Oh no, here we go again.’ I think we’ve actually done a pretty good job of that.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Red Sox showed some resiliency the last two days, overcoming early deficits only to come apart in the late innings.After Reynolds’s first homer gave Baltimore a 1-0 lead, the Red Sox rallied behind Carl Crawford. He led off the third with a triple, then tied the score on Jason Varitek’s infield grounder. An inning later, Crawford drove in two runs with a two-out double off the Green Monster.

D. Drew could both be available Friday, Terry Francona said. ... Jon Lester will start Friday’s game, followed by Tim Wakefield on Saturday. Francona had not settled on Sunday’s starter, but he ruled out Erik Bedard, who threw 76 pitches in two and two-thirds innings Tuesday.

Those wins, combined with the Red Sox’ 6-4 loss to the Baltimore Orioles in Boston, gave the Yankees their 12th division crown since the team’s remarkable run of success began in 1996.

The Red Sox have lost 16 out of 21 games, but they picked up a half-game in the wild-card standings over the Rays and now lead Tampa Bay and the Los Angeles Angels by two and a half games.In the last three games, the Yankees have done for Boston what Adrian Gonzalez and Carl Crawford — their marquee off-season acquisitions — could not do in the four-game series at Fenway Park last week, when the Rays won three out of four.

Pinch-hitting with the bases loaded and two out in the eighth, Posada lashed a two-run single to break a 2-2 tie while the fans roared their approval.

Eduardo Nunez hit a leadoff home run off the starter James Shields to tie the score, 2-2, then Robinson Cano hit a two-run double, scoring Brett Gardner and Jeter.Rivera threw a perfect ninth inning for his 44th save, and with that the Yankees ensured themselves a place in the postseason for the 16th time in 17 years, barring only 2008.

But he and General Manager Brian Cashman will also try to rest some players in preparation for the October games that they earned through the first 155 games of the regular season.“We’ll try to keep the pedal to the metal,” Cashman said, “but at the same time keep an eye on the assets that we have and make sure they’re ready to play at full capability when it counts in October.”And for the 16th time since 1995 for the Yankees, there will be an October.

6    One of the criticisms of the approach immortalized in Moneyball is that what the Oakland Athletics actually did to succeed in the early 2000s had little to do with underappreciated players like Jeremy Giambi or Scott Hatteberg and everything to do with Mark Mulder, Tim Hudson, and Barry Zito. Those three pitchers, who in 2002 combined for nearly 675 innings of 3.05 ERA baseball, are given surprisingly little time in the book. This despite the A's leading the American League in ERA, and were a close second in total runs allowed, while scoring a just-above-league-average number of runs per game. "Moneyball" the critics say, "is little more than the long-known truth that great teams start with great starting pitching". Anybody who's taken it upon themselves to follow the Baltimore Orioles and their quest for relevancy knows exactly how true that critique is. Andy MacPhail, the de facto General Manager of the Orioles, has tried to rebuild the struggling franchise around that exact brand of Moneyball. He has preached patience while the O's tried to develop their own championship-caliber rotation of homegrown and cheap arms. That the MacPhail-led effort seems to be stalling out right now goes to show exactly why good starting pitching is so valuable in this game. In the next couple of years, the O's are probably staring at yet another serious rebuilding effort instead of the pennant races they imagined, and the difference is 100% the failed development of the so-called "cavalry". It was all supposed to begin with the starting pitching. Nothing is more important, and therefore nothing is more difficult to find, especially for a bad team in the toughest division in baseball. Which is how I arrived at my answer to the question "Who is the most under-appreciated Oriole ever?". Not "the" answer, but certainly mine. This is a guy that was exactly the perfect player for the Orioles, an elite starting pitcher to build around. This is a guy who gave the Orioles a discount on his first trip through free agency and then got lowballed until he walked away from the team, leaving the Orioles desperately searching for someone just like him for the next decade plus (and counting). In my sports watching lifetime, I've never seen a bigger mistake made, and I've never hated a guy more for leaving via free agency.    I'm talking about Mike Mussina, of course.   Fact: Mussina was better than Jim Palmer. He gave up fewer baserunners, struck out more batters, and had a lower ERA relative to the rest of baseball than Palmer. Moose was the best pitcher the Orioles ever had, and we should engaged in that endless argument forever: Moose or Cakes? But of course we aren't, because Mussina went to the New York Yankees after the 2000 season. That basically demolished his entire Baltimore career in a lot of eyes.    I count myself among those who felt scorned, if not personally sleighted. For the longest time I was driven by absolute hatred of Mussina. When I moved to New York State for college in 2004, I would watch his starts on YES just to root against him. He betrayed me, and I would have happy delusions of him laying awake at night regretting that choice, or of me getting some kind of personal revenge in person. You might remember the one guy who came to  Camden Yards for a Yankees game carrying a sign reading something to the effect of "Hey Mike, eight years later you're still a traitor! How's the ring fit?". That wasn't me, but it might as well have been. I ate that sign up. I wanted to buy that guy a beer in the worst way. I wanted to punch Mike Mussina in the face in the worst way.    That I ever let hatred control me like that is embarrassing. And I think the way Mussina has been ostracized by so many O's fans, and by the Orioles themselves, is more embarrassing. This is the guy who started Cal's record-breaking game. This is the guy who inspired the "Cito Sucks!" t-shirts. This is Mike Mussina, the best pitcher the Orioles ever had. We've forgotten that, because we're angry. Angry at the Yankees, angry at the unfairness of sharing a division with them, angry at the way the Orioles have been mismanaged – and that starts with the mismanagement that drove Moose out of town. And the mismanagement that has kept Moose noticeably absent from any and all Orioles alumni activities since his retirement. And that has failed to develop another pitcher like him since, well, him. Someday Mike Mussina will come back to Camden Yards and the Orioles will show the man the appreciation he deserves. I hope it's soon. In the meantime, I'll be fantasizing about getting a chance to shake his hand and let him know that I'm glad that he is, was, and always will be, one of the very best Baltimore Orioles ever.
