They came back the next afternoon to play in sloppy conditions again, and had to play 11 innings. That night they flew into Baltimore for a one-day makeup, and even before they got there they endured more unsettling events as their charter plane experienced severe turbulence as it approached the airport.

He was sent to Anaheim straight from New York to avoid the hectic travel the Yankees have endured the last few days. The Yankees’ game against the Orioles on Thursday was a makeup date for the Aug. 27 rainout in Baltimore due to Hurricane Irene.According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Yankees’ consecutive losses to the Orioles on Wednesday at Yankee Stadium and Thursday at Camden Yards in Baltimore marked only the second time in major league history that a team lost in extra innings on consecutive days to the same team in different ballparks. (It also happened on April 19 and 20, 1900, when the Boston Beaneaters — now the Atlanta Braves — lost to the Philadelphia Phillies, 19-17, in 10 innings at the South End Grounds in Boston, then lost at Philadelphia’s Baker Bowl the next day, 5-4, in 11 innings.)

I thought they took the right attitude.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  At the end of their journey west, the Yankees faced a team playing well and fighting for a playoff spot.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Angels have won five of their last seven games to pull within two and a half games of the first-place Texas Rangers in the American League West. The Angels — a possible postseason opponent for the Yankees if they overtake the Rangers — had trailed by seven games on Aug. 17.“It can be really tough coming out west,” Girardi said, “and you talk about this club, they’re a dangerous team because of their speed, and their starting pitching, and everything they have. But I don’t look at it that way. We just need to win games.”INSIDE PITCHNick Swisher felt a sharp pain in his left elbow after making a throw in Thursday’s game in Baltimore and was left out of Friday’s lineup. He was expected to visit the Angels’ team doctor and could get a magnetic resonance imaging test on the elbow. Swisher has been dealing with soreness for some time, but he has not missed games until now. ... Dellin Betances, a right-handed pitcher, was called up and could be used out of the bullpen in long relief, Joe Girardi said. To stay loose since the end of the season for Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Betances played catch at his home in Teaneck, N.J., with his brother Anthony.
