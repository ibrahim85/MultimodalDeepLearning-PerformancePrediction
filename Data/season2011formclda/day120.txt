RiverDogs’ road game against the Rome (Ga.) Braves. And he was about to register a five-strikeout ninth inning.“I wasn’t really keeping count,” Mark Montgomery said. “But I knew it was unusual.”Montgomery, 20, had been called up from the Staten Island Yankees the previous day after striking out the side in three consecutive appearances in the New York-Penn League. Now, for the first time in a long time, he was nervous. The first batter tripled and the next one singled, slicing Charleston’s lead to 10-8.Montgomery then used his fastball and slider to register two strikeouts. The next batter struck out swinging, and back in Williamsburg, Ron Montgomery exhaled. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Except the inning was not over. The ball had skipped off the dirt and caromed to the backstop, allowing the batter to reach base. The next batter also flailed at Montgomery’s dazzling slider and struck out. But once again the ball danced past the Yankees’ 18-year-old catcher, Gary Sanchez. The bases were loaded.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Ron Montgomery, who is the chief deputy of a sheriff’s office in Virginia, wanted to reach through his computer and tell his son to relax, to slow down, to continue to throw his pitch.“All those things I’d say when I coached him growing up, calling his pitches,” he said. “When I was at those games, it didn’t affect me. It’s harder when you’re not there.”Mark Montgomery settled in and froze left-fielder Robby Hefflinger with a called third strike. This time, Sanchez caught the ball and Montgomery had his fifth strikeout of the inning, an accomplishment that tests the boundaries of baseball.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  There has never been a five-strikeout inning in a major league game. Montgomery became the first South Atlantic League player to have one since Jason Lakman of the Hickory Crawdads in 1997. Lakman pitched 10 years in the minors and never reached the major leagues.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Aside from his one splendid inning, Lakman’s strikeout totals were never as startling as Montgomery’s. Montgomery has 28 strikeouts in 141/3 innings for Staten Island and Charleston. His rate of 17.6 strikeouts per nine innings is the highest of any player — from Class A to the majors — who has pitched at least five innings this year.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  His fastball can touch 95 miles an hour, his slider is clearly puzzling, and opponents are batting just .207 against him. He has converted all eight of his save chances and has a 1.88 earned run average, but he is only in Class A, after all, and is not close to becoming the Yankees’ successor to Mariano Rivera. And in the minor leagues, potential is defeated by reality more often than not.

Credit             Kate Thornton for The New York Times           There is something tantalizing, nevertheless, about a pitcher who can strike out five batters in one inning.“He goes after guys and basically thinks no one can hit him,” the RiverDogs’ pitching coach, Carlos Chantres, said. “He’s got this slider I haven’t seen in a while from a 20-year-old kid.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Montgomery started pitching in Little League when he was 9. There was a three-inning limit, and he routinely struck out all nine batters he faced. When he became stronger, his father wore full catcher’s gear during backyard throwing sessions.

As a sophomore he developed his slider and registered 45 strikeouts in 35 innings with a 3.09 earned run average.Last summer, Montgomery pitched for Edenton, N.C., in the Coastal Plain League, a high-level college summer bracket, and struck out 54 in 28 innings.

He is a gym rat, preferring 24-hour facilities for occasional 1 a.m. workouts.And he loves strikeouts. He really loves strikeouts.

Exactly what happens to Nova after that will be determined once he pitches.Nova made 16 starts for the Yankees this season, compiling an 8-4 record and a 4.14 earned run average, before he was sent — much to his displeasure — to Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on July 3. Phil Hughes was ready to return, and someone in the rotation had to go.“The guy we brought back into the rotation won 18 games last year,” Girardi said, referring to Hughes. “There are not that many people who do that every year. We also thought there were some things Nova could work on.”Nova, 24, pitched only 16 innings in three games in Class AAA, compiling a 1-2 record and a 3.38 E.R.A. Nova struck out 18 batters while walking only two. He also overcame an injury sustained in his first start for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.

Bartolo Colon, the starter in the first game Saturday, ended a personal three-game losing streak on Sunday by allowing two runs in seven innings in a 7-5 victory over the Oakland Athletics.

3 View photosToronto Blue Jays' Aaron Hill dives safely into third during the third inning of during the third inning of a baseball game against Baltimore Orioles Thursday, July 28, 2011, in Toronto. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Chris Young)MoreTORONTO (AP) — Colby Rasmus found his head spinning in his debut with the Toronto Blue Jays, both from a busy couple of days and his new team's 12-hit attack.Edwin Encarnacion and Eric Thames hit back-to-back home runs, Carlos Villanueva won for the first time in five starts and Toronto beat the Orioles 8-5 on Thursday night, handing Baltimore its eighth consecutive series loss.Encarnacion went 3 for 4 with two RBIs and scored twice for the Blue Jays, who have won 27 of 31 home games against Baltimore dating to 2008."Fun to watch, that was awesome," Rasmus said of his new team's offensive showing. "I was ready to get in on some of the action. I wasn't able to do it today but I felt pretty good, I feel good about the situation. I think it's going to be a good time."Acquired from St. Louis on Wednesday, Rasmus started in center field and hit second. He went 0 for 5 with two strikeouts and was the only Toronto starter not to reach base."With all the stuff going on, my mind was all over the place," Rasmus said. "I couldn't relax and settle down, my mind was everywhere."Blue Jays manager John Farrell said he wasn't surprised Rasmus had trouble keeping things straight."I'm sure today was a little bit of a whirlwind for him," Farrell said. "Tonight he might have pulled off a few pitches that otherwise he stays on but we've just got to give him an opportunity to settle in."Baltimore has not won a series since taking two of three against Cincinnati from June 24-26."It's unfortunate," Orioles outfielder Adam Jones said. "We started out on top and couldn't maintain it."Hardy homered to left on Villanueva's second pitch of the game, his 17th and the fourth time this season he's led off a game with a home run.Two outs later, Guerrero whacked a drive to left, his eighth."Not the way I wanted to start off," Villanueva said.Toronto tied it in the bottom of the first against Brad Bergesen. The Blue Jays loaded the bases with a double, a walk and an error by first baseman Derrek Lee before Encarnacion drew a bases-loaded walk and Thames followed with a sacrifice fly."At this level, momentum is everything," Bergesen said. "We had it in our favor and I gave it right back."Villanueva (6-2) had not won since beating St. Louis on June 25. He allowed four runs and six hits in five innings, walked two and struck out one.Toronto newcomer P.J. Walters, Casey Janssen and Frank Francisco each pitched one inning of scoreless relief. Jon Rauch gave up Hardy's second homer in the ninth.Four of Hardy's five hits in the series were home runs."It's good to see J.J. Hardy leave," Farrell said. "He had a heck of a series."The Blue Jays took the lead for good and chased Bergesen with a four-run third, doing all the damage with two outs. Encarnacion homered to left, his eighth, and Thames followed with a drive to right, his fifth. It was the sixth time this season the Blue Jays went back-to-back."It's disappointing," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "We've got an 0-2 count, two outs and nobody on. Next thing you know he's given up some runs that were a dagger for us."Aaron Hill walked and went to third on Travis Snider's single, sliding in safely when third baseman Mark Reynolds dropped the throw. Both runners scored when J.P. Arencibia followed with a double down the left-field line, with Snider safe at the plate when Matt Wieters fumbled the relay from Reynolds.Showalter called the missed catches "two sure outs we should have had."Bergesen (2-7) allowed six runs, four earned, and six hits in three innings, his shortest outing of the season. He walked three and struck out none."I didn't slow the game down when I needed to," Bergesen said. "I just kept going quicker and quicker with my tempo."Baltimore cut it to 6-4 in the fifth on a two-run single by Jones, but the Blue Jays answered with two in the bottom half against reliever Mark Hendrickson. Encarnacion scored from third when Reynolds couldn't handle a pickoff throw from Wieters, and Yunel Escobar followed with an RBI single.Hardy hit a two-out homer in the ninth, his 18th. It was his second multihomer game of the series and the sixth of his career.NOTES: LHP Brad Mills will start for Toronto against Texas on Saturday. He takes the spot of LHP Jo-Jo Reyes, who was designated for assignment last week. ... The Blue Jays optioned INF Mike McCoy to Triple-A Las Vegas to make room on the roster for Rasmus, utilityman Mark Teahen, LHP Trever Miller and Walters. Walters was optioned to Las Vegas after the game, with RHP Jesse Litsch recalled in his place. ... INF Cesar Izturis (right elbow) will work out with the Orioles when they open a four-game series in New York on Friday, but Showalter isn't sure when he will be ready to come off the 60-day DL. ... Orioles RHP Koji Uehara extended his scoreless innings streak to 14 with one shutout frame and has not allowed a run since June 19 at Washington.
