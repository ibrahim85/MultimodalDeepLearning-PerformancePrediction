The other Red Sox were out on the field, stretching for batting practice, but this one would not be joining them.“I’m good today, guys,” Kevin Youkilis said, wearily, when approached by a few reporters. “I’m not going to answer questions every day about how I feel.”Youkilis’s body had told the story the night before. Youkilis has bursitis in his left hip and needs surgery for a sports hernia after the season. He all but creaked at third base on Thursday, a one-man version of his sputtering team, crumbling near the finish line as the spry Tampa Bay Rays bear down.The Red Sox needed to feel whole again. They needed to show they could handle the pesky, persistent team that never seems to care about its tight budget. With their wild-card lead whittled to three, they needed Josh Beckett.

Over the last eight games, covering most of his absence, no Boston starter had met the minimum requirements for a quality start: at least six innings, no more than three earned runs.

The slide had recalled memories of the Red Sox’ 2-10 start.“We’re in a bad stretch at a bad time,” Beckett said after grinding through six innings. “Kind of like at the beginning of the year. Everybody wrote us off. Nobody’s ever bounced back from that, and we have. Our guys have persevered through a lot of things.”  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  They did so on Friday, overcoming what Beckett called a debacle of a first inning that started with a bunt single and his own throwing error, and included a two-run homer by Evan Longoria.

A fourth-inning homer by Youkilis’s replacement, Mike Aviles, gave the Red Sox their first lead in the last 42 innings between these teams.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “Every day you come to the park, you have a chance to do something special,” said Aviles, who escaped the Kansas City Royals in a July trade. “Lucky for me, today was my day.”Scoring four runs off Shields is a feat, but the Red Sox know they can score, even without Youkilis and with Carl Crawford a shadow of his Tampa Bay self. This night was about pitching, which meant Beckett, and everything that comes with him.

Watching him plod can be painful, and the Rays passed the time by gleefully running as soon as he raised his left leg.

Credit             Jim Rogash/Getty Images           They stole six bases off Beckett, three by Johnny Damon. Yet only one of the steals turned into a run, mostly because catcher Jason Varitek sailed his throw into center.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  “At some point in time, you’ve just got to stop caring,” Beckett said. “You just let them do what they’re going to do. I’m worried about making a pitch and getting somebody out.”Beckett’s outing was not smooth — he retired the side in order just once — but he allowed two earned runs and seven hits and struck out seven, with one intentional walk. He showed typical toughness under pressure, ending four innings with a runner in scoring position.

Bard has been awful lately — he had a 17.36 earned run average and three blown saves in five September games — but he struck out the side with a walk on Friday. Rediscovering his changeup made the difference.

The victory restored a four-game cushion in the wild-card race, with 12 games to play, including seven against the last-place Baltimore Orioles.The Rays, meanwhile, have seven games left with the first-place Yankees.

Privacy Policy    DODGERS PRESS FOR TV AUCTION The Los Angeles Dodgers are seeking a bankruptcy court judge’s approval to auction off their future cable television rights. But in so doing, they might run into stiff opposition from Major League Baseball and Fox.In its motion requesting approval, the Dodgers said the market was “optimal” to sell the rights to 150 games a year beyond 2013. And it suggested that Fox, which carries the Dodgers on its Prime Ticket regional network; Time Warner Cable; DirecTV; Dish Network; Charter; and private investors “may welcome” the chance to start a regional channel focused on the Dodgers or be a partner with the team in a new channel.Any delay in an auction “risks deterioration in value due to changed circumstances,” said the motion, which was filed Friday in federal bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Del.The Dodgers tried to extend their current contract with Prime Ticket, but Commissioner Bud Selig rejected the plan. (The deal, worth at least $2 billion over 17 years, would have provided Frank McCourt, the Dodgers’ owner, with a $385 million upfront payment and a 35 percent stake in Prime Ticket.) Selig told McCourt that he had put the team in a bad position by not waiting to test the market at a time when he was under duress from a liquidity crisis and divorce.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The team said in the motion that the payments proposed by Fox were conservative compared with what it could get in an auction.

6  I was just thinking about Matt Wieters and how happy he makes me, and I decided to take a trip over to FanGraphs to look at his most up-to-date numbers. Lo and behold, their latest article is actually about our special one. Of course I expect you to go to FanGraphs to read the entire article, but here is some of the meat: When examining Wieters' Fielding Independent Batting (walks, strikeouts, home runs, BABIP):  Over his first two seasons, in 887 plate appearances, Matt Wieters posted 87 walks (9.8%), 180 strikeouts (20.3%), 20 homers (2.3%) and a .317 BABIP — all leading to about a 90 wRC+. Using the minimum samples for each of the relevant stats, we find that Wieters has improved considerably. While his walk rate has decreased (to 8.4%) over the last 200 plate appearances, Wieters’ strikeout rate (17.0% over the last 150 PA) and home run rate (5.0% over last 300 PA) have both improved — with the latter showing marked improvement. If we entertain the possibility that each of these new marks represents Wieters’ true talent, we find (via the magic of Bradley Woodrum’s Should Hit calculator, and plugging in Wieters’ career .303 BABIP) that Wieters is now no longer a slightly below-average hitter relative to the league, but rather something like a 130 wRC+ hitter. Assuming average defense at the catcher spot, a 130 wRC+ hitter is worth something like six wins (i.e. 6.0 WAR) every 650 plate appearances — a mark that fewer than 20 players are likely to reach in any given season.     Further, FanGraphs suggests that we shouldn't just write off small sample size because of Wieters' pedigree as an elite college hitter. Instead, we should expect that Wieters will continue to hit as he has begun to over his last 300 or so plate appearances, and the article ends with, "Wieters will likely end up being Matt Wieters of legend." So there is your good news for the day.
