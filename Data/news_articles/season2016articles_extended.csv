03/03/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Starting Lineup Projections', 'As we get into Spring Training, here are my statistic projections for the Baltimore Orioles starting lineup.As the baseball season starts to get into gear and Spring Training gets going, I\xe2\x80\x99ve put together a series of statistic projections for how I think the Orioles starting lineup will perform. As a disclaimer, this can (and likely will) change as two things happen:It\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible the Orioles sign someone (someone like, say, Austin Jackson), and then the lineup will change.Spring Training performances may alter my projections a bit, though only a little, as I don\xe2\x80\x99t put a whole lot of stock in spring training stats. I will also be posting a starting rotation projections article as well, so keep an eye out for that.So here are my projections for the 2016 starting lineup for the Orioles (for reference of some of the stats I mention, click here):Hyun-Soo Kim: .272/.340/.420, 15 HR, 75 R, 76 RBI, 7 SBThe Orioles new addition from South Korea is going to be a great part of the team, I think. He has shown tremendous patience at the plate in Korea, with an OBP that would be among the league\xe2\x80\x99s best in the MLB, and a decent amount of pop and skill making contact.Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have the year he had in Korea. The Korean league is about equivalent to AA ball here in the states, but a skill like plate discipline and a good eye is something that can easily translate into the major leagues. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting too that KBO-transfer Jung-Ho Kang didn\xe2\x80\x99t strike out anymore in the MLB than he did in the KBO, so it\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable to assume that Kim will be similar.Kim will make a great leadoff hitter with his ability to get on base, and he could provide some decent power too. In all honesty, I\xe2\x80\x99m being conservative with my estimate, and I really think Kim\xe2\x80\x99s power ceiling is somewhere around 20 HRs. I think Kim could ultimately be like\xc2\xa0Nick Markakis\xc2\xa0but with more power.2.\xc2\xa0Manny Machado: .289/.359/.498, 30 HR, 98 R, 86 RBI, 15 SBManny finally had the breakout year everyone knew he was capable of last year and has now firmly placed himself as one of the best players in all of baseball, and probably the best third baseman.And the most beautiful thing about his breakout? Statistically, nothing registers that it was a fluke. He started crushing the ball, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to think he can\xe2\x80\x99t continue that. His isolated power went from .153 to .216, which is a massive increase, and his average batted-ball distance is over 290 feet. His hard hit rate was a career-best 33.1%, which is above the league average of around 30%, and his wOBA was a fantastic .370 (league average is about .320).So yea, Manny is incredible, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep being incredible. The only thing that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think will carry over as much are the steals. He\xe2\x80\x99ll still steal a good number of bases, but he went out of his way to go 20/20 last year. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if he focused more on hitting and less on stealing this year.3.\xc2\xa0Adam Jones: .277/.315/.475, 31 HR, 85 R, 95 RBI, 5 SBAdam Jones is a scary and strange player from a statistical perspective. He swings at absolutely everything, ending each year with an OBP in the low-.300s, and with a terrible walk rate. Yet, somehow, he always hits the ball. As an Orioles fan, you don\xe2\x80\x99t look the gift horse in the mouth and are just happy with his production, but there\xe2\x80\x99s reason to be wary.Each year of the past three years his contact rate has gone up, and each year his hard hit rate has gone down. So he\xe2\x80\x99s hitting the ball more, which is great, but he\xe2\x80\x99s hitting it softer and softer. So far, it\xe2\x80\x99s been fine, the changes are minimal, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m not projecting Jones to all of a sudden bomb this year. But the way he approaches the plate is ripe for a spectacular crash one year, and if that year was this year, or next, don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised. The Law of Averages tends to be right more often than not.Until then though, Jones will, I believe, continue to be one of the best hitters on the Orioles, reaching 30 HRs and batting in the high-.200s. He\xe2\x80\x99ll also likely continue to be a Gold Glove-caliber fielder, as he\xe2\x80\x99s been every year.4.\xc2\xa0Chris Davis: .252/.341/.542, 40 HR, 90 R, 112 RBI, 2 SBThe prodigal son returned. After what felt like forever negotiating a contract, Chris Davis is back in Baltimore where he can crush home runs to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s delight.The man is pure power, and the beautiful thing about him is he\xe2\x80\x99s in the exact right place for the way he hits. Last year, he pulled the ball more than he ever had before (55% of the time, which is way above the league average 40% pull rate) and in Camden Yards, Fenway Park, and Yankee Stadium, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what you want to do as a left-handed power hitter. His hard hit rate (41.4%) was among the 20-best in the MLB last year; add that to his pull rate and his ridiculous 29.4% HR/FB, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got home runs by the dozen.Is he going to strikeout a lot? You bet. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be shocked if we saw another 200 strikeout year from him, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter when he hits 40 home runs. He\xe2\x80\x99s a three true outcome hitter (HR/BB/K) and we\xe2\x80\x99re not expecting anything else from him.Sep 9, 2015; Bronx, NY, USA; Baltimore Orioles designated hitter Chris Davis (19) hits an RBI ground rule double against the New York Yankees in the ninth inning at Yankee Stadium. The Orioles defeated the Yankees 5-3. Mandatory Credit: Andy Marlin-USA TODAY Sports5. Pedro Alvarez:\xc2\xa0.240/.315/.471, 32 HR, 65 R, 84 RBI, 2 SBThe recent Orioles signing has come off a six-year stretch with the Pirates and established himself as a monster home run hitter and little else. He is the three-true-outcome hitter, as he has struck out, walked, or hit a home run in 44.1% of his career plate appearances. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that he\xe2\x80\x99s not some decent-OBP power hitter like Adam Dunn used to be. Alvarez strikes out a lot more than he walks, his career strikeout rate is 29.1%.Regardless, Alvarez can pummel the ball, his career hard hit rate is at 37.4%, (when he hits a fly ball, it\xe2\x80\x99s typically gone, with a career HR/FB of 22.5%, which is more than double the league average) and more often than not, Pedro pulls the ball, which is perfect for Camden Yards.Pedro is what Pedro is. A monster power hitter with a low average, and with him in the lineup, the Orioles add yet another monster power threat, but take on another average liability. But in any case, expect to see some more dingers crushed in Camden Yards.6.\xc2\xa0Mark\xc2\xa0Trumbo: .254/.304/.476, 30 HR, 73 R, 88 RBI, 1 SBOne of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bigger acquisitions of the offseason was trading\xc2\xa0Steve Clevenger\xc2\xa0to the Mariners for Trumbo. During his time in the major leagues, Trumbo has been known to do one thing: hit the ball exceptionally hard. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t walk, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get on base, he just hits home runs and strikes out. In Anaheim, he did that pretty well, averaging around 30 home runs each year; but the past two years with Arizona and Seattle have been rough for him.Luckily, though, there are explanations for his decline those past two years. First of all, he dealt with some injury troubles (a stress fracture in his foot), and second, he was in a park (and division) that\xe2\x80\x99s not nearly as hitter-friendly as the AL East is. What is encouraging is seeing that his hard hit rate has stayed roughly the same the past four years; and last year, he started hitting the ball to the opposite field a lot more than he ever did before. If he can keep doing that, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be set, because right field is the field to take advantage of in the AL East between Camden Yards, the Pesky Pole in Fenway, and Yankee Stadium.His fly ball rate has stayed roughly the same, but his HR/FB rate has dropped, which normally would be concerning. But fret not, because since his hard hit rate has stayed the same, there\xe2\x80\x99s little cause for alarm, which is why I\xe2\x80\x99m entirely confident that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to hit 30 home runs with the Orioles this year, especially if he\xe2\x80\x99s the full-time DH (as he should be) and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about fielding.6.\xc2\xa0Matt Wieters: .248/.302/.418, 14 HR, 38 R, 47 RBI, 0 SBI know. Those projections seem kind of low for the almighty Wieters. But honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to play the whole year. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we got him for the one year and didn\xe2\x80\x99t overpay for him, but I think Wieters will get hurt, as it seems he\xe2\x80\x99s wont to do, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t get a full year in.I think at this point we know what Wieters is. He\xe2\x80\x99s a power hitter and an incredible fielder. Given a full year, I think he could hit 20 HRs and bat around .250, but I just don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99ll get there, especially if he\xe2\x80\x99s spending the majority of his time behind the plate. I\xe2\x80\x99m hopeful though, because he\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly valuable as a fielder, and makes the Orioles noticeably better, especially the pitching staff with the way he can call a game.8.\xc2\xa0Jonathan Schoop: .258/.292/.435, 20 HR, 56 R, 58 RBI, 3 SBSchoop is an odd bird (pun only slightly unintended) at second base. He\xe2\x80\x99s a big power hitter at second, which is not typically a power position. Last year was a great year for him; he ended up with .279 AVG, but a .329 BABIP seems to predict a regression in that, especially considering how much he strikes out, his lack of speed, and how little he walks (his BB% was a miserable 2.8% last year to go with a .306 OBP).But what\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0really his power. Last year his ISO jumped up to .203 from a .145 the year before, and his hard hit rate went up from 26% to 34.5%. Schoop is going to crush the ball, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a very good fielder at second base. He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get on base a lot, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to strike out a lot, but if he\xe2\x80\x99s hitting 20 home runs, you can live with that.More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injury9. J. J. Hardy: .246/.284/.361, 11 HR, 52 R, 53 RBI, 0 SBIt seems that gone are the days of\xc2\xa0J.J. Hardy\xc2\xa0hitting 25-30 home runs and batting in the .260s, age is a pain like that. The 33-year-old should be serviceable at shortstop, certainly as an above-average to good fielder, and as a mediocre hitter.In case you were wondering what happened to him, the answer is likely age. The power has just gone away, whether it was the injuries that plagued him a couple years back, or age, or both, it\xe2\x80\x99s gone. His hard hit rate has dropped steadily over the past four years, bottoming out to a career low last year (23.7%), while his soft contact rate has been steadily increasing. Along with that, his ISO has plummeted down to a career-low .092 last year. Add in the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s striking out more than ever before, and you can easily see a man in the twilight years of his career.Hardy will be serviceable, and that\xe2\x80\x99s fine, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll be little more than that.Looking at the Orioles starting lineup as a whole, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable to expect a team that strikes out a lot (we could easily lead the league in strikeouts), hits for a low average (probably around .260 as a team), doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run (we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be dead-last again in steals) and hits a ton of home runs.By my projections, the team should hit around 200 home runs, which would have been good for top-five in the league last year. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a balanced team, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a powerful team, and that will account for something.UPDATE: Since initially writing this, the Orioles signed Pedro Alvarez. He has now been included in this article and Jimmy Paredes has been taken out.\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Major League Baseball Wants to Let Cuban Players Sign ...', '     Supported by    Baseball  Major League Baseball Wants to Let Cuban Players Sign Directly With Teams  By BEN STRAUSSMARCH 2, 2016    Continue reading the main story Share This Page  Continue reading the main story                  if (             window.magnum             && window.magnum.getFlags().indexOf(\'headlineBalancer\') > 0             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.shouldRun()         ) {             window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize();         }         Photo       A game at Nelson Fern\xc3\xa1ndez Stadium in San Jos\xc3\xa9, Cuba, in 2014 between Mayabeque, in the dugout, and Granma.

If approved, it could represent a sea change in relations between the two countries and drastically reshape how Cuban players find their way to the major leagues.For decades, Cubans have had to play for minuscule wages \xe2\x80\x94 now $40 to $200 per month \xe2\x80\x94 or defect from their island homeland to pursue baseball careers in America. A Cold War-era embargo that only Congress can remove is still in place and largely prohibits American companies and citizens from doing business in Cuba.Under the proposed plan, according to M.L.B.\xe2\x80\x99s top lawyer, Dan Halem, an entity made up of Cuban entrepreneurs and officials from baseball and its players\xe2\x80\x99 union would be created. A percentage of salaries paid to Cuban players would go to the new body, which would function like a nonprofit organization and support youth baseball, education and the improvement of sports facilities in Cuba.The proposed body could satisfy the terms of the embargo, M.L.B. contends, because no money would go directly to the Cuban government.

Officials there declined to comment, citing the confidentiality of the license application process.

The Cuban government has allowed more citizens to engage in cuentapropismo, or self-employment, in ventures like opening restaurants and food stands, working as clowns at birthday parties and driving taxis. Baseball players could be granted special licenses to follow a similar model, with the government taxing their American salaries.Worker cooperatives are another possibility. Ballplayers could form a group, as farmers and restaurant workers have done, and negotiate directly with major league teams.

Ubaldo Jimenez had a terrible start in game 2, only getting one out in the first inning and throwing 34 pitches and allowing seven runs. Miguel Gonzalez was not great in game 3, getting four outs but yielding seven runs.The good news is that both pitchers came out of the starts saying they felt fine and got in the work they needed. Late in spring training, these results would be more concerning. For now, let\xe2\x80\x99s just say it is earlier and move on.Dylan Bundy and Hunter Harvey have both looked good and healthy, which is a good sign. Rule 5 pick Joey Rickard has been pretty good. As has Jason Garcia.Hyun Soo Kim is still adjusting, something I expect to last even into the season. So far, he is 0-for-9 with one strike out. But, I saw today that Jung-Ho Kang went 9-for-45 last Spring, so that helps put things in perspective. Even if Kim starts in the minors, I think he will make an impact in 2016.But, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean things have all been ok. Chris Tillman looks like he is recovered from his injury, which is a sigh of relief, because that would have been a major setback for the rotation.

Perhaps a veteran who won\xe2\x80\x99t make it, or maybe a young guy catching on?Courtesy of Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY SportsFirst off, that might be a bit of an unfair question. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the NFL where we routinely see aging vets cut during camp and so forth. And the reason for that is simple; baseball contracts are guaranteed. If a team decides to DFA a player off their roster, not only are they still on the hook for that guy\xe2\x80\x99s salary, but they\xe2\x80\x99re also running the risk that they\xe2\x80\x99ll end up paying the guy to literally play against them.In football contracts aren\xe2\x80\x99t guaranteed, so while the player\xe2\x80\x99s salary will count against the salary cap the team isn\xe2\x80\x99t on the hook for the cash. Nevertheless, the odds of someone being \xe2\x80\x9ccut\xe2\x80\x9d from the Orioles isn\xe2\x80\x99t good. Could it happen? Sure.

"", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: A Manny Machado Extension Possible?', 'Will the Baltimore Orioles offer Manny Machado an extension in 2016 and keep the spending going?The Baltimore Orioles have spent a lot of money this Off-Season, the most in MLB, to the tune of around $250 Million. Baltimore has been in buy-mode and displayed they\xe2\x80\x99re adamant about keeping the core guys around. So what\xe2\x80\x99s next on the agenda? Could this be the year we see them negotiate a contract extension with rising star Manny Machado?Speaking of the off-season, Major League Baseball saw a trend that was reminiscent of when I was young. Finally, ball players were resigning with their respected teams, at a rate we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen in many years. I am personally a huge fan of that kind of loyalty. Could you imagine watching Cal Ripken Jr play with any team outside of Baltimore? If he were playing in this era it would be a more likely scenario.At the end of the 2015 season, the Orioles ownership and management stressed the importance of keeping the core guys together but most fans didn\xe2\x80\x99t find it fathomable. I remember watching interviews with Duquette and Showalter, thinking to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no way Baltimore can afford to keep Chris Davis, Matt Wieters, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, and Wei-Yin Chen\xe2\x80\x9d.

They have to be the most loyal team I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in years. So this year I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping the Orioles continue to follow suit and break our 32 year World Series drought. If this happens, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine a better way to validate the importance of players staying with their existing organizations.Along the same lines, the loyalty we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, from players and teams alike, throughout the Off-Season is being taken to an greater extant and starting yet another trend, core player extensions. It started with the Marlins signing Dee Gordon to a 5-yr $50 Million dollar extension, then we saw Kansas City extend not one but 3 core players (Cain, Moustakas, and Perez), and more recently Kolten Wong signed a 5-yr extension with St. Louis.There are obvious benefits for an organization by extending a player prior to their availability to free agency. In my opinion, none more important than proving to fans that the organizations are loyal to them. Without fans there is no MLB. We pay the way for the greatest game on earth and as a fan I take a deep pride in this. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I make it a point to go to as many games as possible, buy memorabilia, and support my team in any way feasible.It seems that this year more than any, ownership has gone out of their way to open their wallets and keep the family together. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing all these extensions throughout the league, it begs the question, will Peter Angelos continue to be generous and offer our star third baseman, Manny Machado, a long term contract extension? Could you imagine seeing him in another jersey?The 23-yr old, two time All-Star, Manny Machado had a breakout season last year, hitting for average with a career high .286, and for power, hitting 35 bombs which is also a career high. He has amazing defensive ability, winning two Gold Gloves, in 2013 (also winning the AL Platinum Glove) and in 2015. Like a fine wine, Machado has proven to get better with age and I highly doubt he\xe2\x80\x99ll be slowing down any time soon.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerManny is making $5 million this year, $4.52 million more than he did in 2015, and will become a free agent after the completion of the 2018 season. Most likely he will see another hike in payroll once he files for arbitration at the end of the season. So should Baltimore preemptive strike and follow Kansas City\xe2\x80\x99s lead? It would make more sense than going through another arbitration negotiation just to end up paying him nearer to the $10 million dollar mark anyway. He\xe2\x80\x99s expressed great interest in staying in Baltimore, so they should just make the process easier on everyone involved.If Baltimore waits until the end of the year that price tag could become even more expensive. Barring injury, it\xe2\x80\x99s most likely Machado will continue to progress this year as well. Following his trend, I predict Machado will finally see his first .300+ Avg. year, hit 27+ HR\xe2\x80\x99s, while maintaining his .500+ Slg. % and .800+ OPS.\xc2\xa0Next: A Year For AnniversariesIf Baltimore is able to come to an agreement with Machado and his agent Dan Lozano, we may see our own 5-yr $60 million dollar extension. This would continue with the theme of loyalty and avoid the drama of arbitration or even worse, free agency. The thought of Machado in another jersey makes me sick so I\xe2\x80\x99d like to think I speak for all Birds fans when I say, Baltimore needs to lock Machado down in a franchise fashion.

Chris Tillman has repped the number well in recent years, and before that it was worn by Luke Scott, Gregg Olson, Dennis Martinez, and Boog Powell (during his rookie year in 1961), among many others. Looking this up taught me that Boog Powell was basically Metta World Peace when it came to jersey numbers: he debuted with #30, then switched to #16, then to #26, then to #8, then back to #26.

Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY SportsWhereas the Baltimore Orioles have had a rough start in spring training games by being winless in seven outings, several young players have made good impressions already.These positives are difficult to appreciate in a sea of negativity. The Orioles are giving up a lot of runs, fueling the fears of many that the pitching is terribly insufficient and substandard for success in the AL East.On one fringe of the Orioles fanbase is a contingent saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSee, right away it is obvious that the starting rotation simply does not have it, and the corner outfielders are major holes in the lineup.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It is not helping that Hyun Soo Kim is 0-for-everything.The other fringe is saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is March 6th for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! These are early spring training games that mean nothing. Come down off the railing of the bridge. Don\xe2\x80\x99t jump yet!\xe2\x80\x9dI\xe2\x80\x99m probably about three-quarters of the way toward the latter view. Apart from horrible starts by Miguel Gonzalez and Ubaldo Jimenez, most of the big innings given up have been by the fringe and AAA and AA pitchers. Many of these guys are starters, but they are being used in first spring training games as relievers. Everything about it is strange. New season, new situation \xe2\x80\xa6But even in this morass of six consecutive losses, there are a number of the younger players who look very good and who have come into camp ready to play. More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryAmong these is Dylan Bundy. It would be huge to have him for the full season as a power arm out of the bullpen. No one could be logically faulted for having skeptical concerns if his health is finally recovered, not after the extensive problems and surgery of the past couple years. So it is great to see his velocity consistently in the low to mid 90s, with pitches clocked above that. Bundy looked very good in an inning of work again on Sunday.Another who is shining is the Rule 5 pick, Joey Rickard. While admittedly not being conversant on the upper-level depth of the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 minor leagues, the parent club is certainly bereft of offensive pop. So it is strange to understand why they allowed Rickard to be exposed for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to pick him up in the offseason. His 2015 season was fantastic \xe2\x80\x94 a combined .321/.427 in 117 games \xe2\x80\xa6 hitting .360 at the AAA level in 29 games.Rickard also had a successful Dominican Winter League season. According to the league stats in Baseball-Reference.com, he led the league in games and plate appearances, tying for home runs with 10 and batting .275 with a .344 OBP. So he is a bit more recently into the ebb and flow of baseball life than many of the others who are shaking off the winter rust.Right now, along with looking good defensively and showing fine speed, Rickard is 5-for-18 with a pair of doubles and two RBIs. Of him, Showalter said \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cTiming is everything. He\xe2\x80\x99s 24, lot of guys start figuring it out. He\xe2\x80\x99s kind of come into his own the last year, carried it over into winter ball. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a chance to make our club. He\xe2\x80\x99s a sharp kid, runs the bases well. Got a sharp IQ. There\xe2\x80\x99s only one way to find out, keep running him out there. These guys were told when they come in, \xe2\x80\x98Be ready to play.\xe2\x80\x99 Looks like Joey heard us.\xe2\x80\x9dAlso playing well is first baseman Christian Walker. The former minor league player of the year, Walker is currently 4-for-12 with six RBIs. All four hits are of the extra-base variety: two doubles, a triple and a homer.Could Walker break camp with the Orioles? It is difficult to imagine that scenario. But if the corner outfield situation is so bad that Kim can\xe2\x80\x99t be retained (or whatever else could go wrong), and if Walker has a sort of spring like Jimmy Paredes had in 2015, maybe he has to be kept. Mark Trumbo can play right field and Walker DH, or some other combination of moves between those two and Chris Davis.Infielder Garabez Rosa is 3-for-4 in his few appearances. Last year he was .253 at AA Bowie.It really is early. Opening day is still four weeks away! Pitchers are working on specific things rather than pitching to exact game situations and hitter weaknesses. So try to enjoy the individual results and reports without reacting to mounting losses. If the O\xe2\x80\x99s lose the last six spring games, there is more substance to justify jumping off a bridge. But not now.

The team ended up allowing ten runs, but if the struggles of Dale Thayer and Jon Keller have an impact on the 2016 Orioles, there are likely bigger problems at hand.    In even better news, there are 29 days until Opening Day. Number 29 was most recently worn by Tommy Hunter, who regardless of his tendency to go boom was one of the most likable O\'s in recent years.

Not your dollar store spellbook curse, either. I\'m talking dark, eldritch magic. The real stuff, like Spinal Tap\'s drummer or the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts.    When the events of the last several weeks are combined with the revolving door in the corner outfield last season, there can be no other explanation. Admittedly, left field last year was worse than right field overall. Still, the two players with the most starts in right field were Gerardo Parra (.625 OPS as an Oriole) and Delmon Young (.628 OPS). Add in Travis Snider (.650 OPS with the O\'s) and that\'s more than half of the games played last year. Developments since spring training has begun reveal the true form of the curse. There is no hiding any more. Its false garments have been tossed aside. The proof of the curse How else can you explain the close-but-no-cigar pursuit of Dexter Fowler but with the kind of power that can only be called forth by an offering of livestock in front of the oldest oak tree at high noon on the solstice? Fowler was going to be the O\'s right fielder, all agreed - then the curse took him and back to Chicago he went. That kind of reversal almost never happens, and yet it\'s exactly what happened to keep the O\'s from getting their man.    Among those who have tried to wear the mantle in spring training, it has seemingly been one disaster after another. The presumptive favorite to win the job, Nolan Reimold, didn\'t even make it to the start of spring training games before a ""cranky"" shoulder\xc2\xa0limited him to designated hitter to begin the Grapefruit League schedule.    Granted, Reimold suffering another injury is not exactly proof of a curse, but then, even dark magic takes a lay-up when it can get one. After Reimold, Mark Trumbo took a turn out there. Trumbo blew two plays into triples in the first inning he played in right field - from the same batter! This, too, is no proof of a curse; one might well have anticipated the outcome of Trumbo in the outfield. Yet it\'s more to make you wonder. He hasn\'t been back out there since.    Add to that the fate of Jimmy Paredes in the midst of his first game standing out there with a glove. You might know the song - ""Right field, it\'s easy you know; you can be awkward and you can be slow"" - and maybe that is the perfect description... except the kid in the song at least gets his triumphant moment at the end, because he knows how to catch and he knows how to throw, way out where the dandelions grow. If you are about my age, you know this song because it played in a commercial for Pizza Hut before your Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles VHS tape. Sorry, where was I? Oh, yeah, Paredes. Look, I\'m sure he tried his best, but what actually happened was he tried to catch a sinking line drive and in the process he injured his wrist. In typical Orioles fashion, this injury was first described as non-serious and definitely not a break of any kind, and now they\xc2\xa0""have to re-image him"" to check for a hairline fracture.    Sounds about right. We know how this will end. Paredes getting hurt was not an expected outcome, but Paredes having a tough time in right field was also predictable. Any one of these things taken individually is not convincing, but all of them added up together can only mean one thing. The only question is, who has laid this curse on the Orioles? The originator of the curse The answer is staring back at us, unsmiling, maybe opening up a beard-obscured mouth long enough to say, ""You know."" For who else could it be except Nick Markakis, the stalwart presence in right field for nearly a full decade before the O\'s chose not to re-sign him? There were no problems when he was here. Now he is gone and one full season was a mess and one spring is a display of ever-increasing carnage and mayhem. Hide your kids. It may not even be a curse that was intentionally laid by Markakis on the Orioles. It\'s tough to figure that any kind of power could possibly be emanating from Markakis as he has been powerless since 2012. Yet power of some kind must be buried deep within him, for my extensive research has revealed that the name Markakis is in fact the modern corruption of the True Name of Mar Ka\'ye\'ka\'iss, the demon whom men in ancient days, fearing the True Name, called He After Whom There Is Only Suck. It still sings.    Even that modern rendering has power of its own kind, because the name ""Nick Markakis"" has anagrams that reveal everything about this curse. Behold: Karma Kicks In A vocal contingent of Orioles fans has been irate ever since Markakis\' departure, but maybe it turns out their sentimental attachment to Markakis was onto something. One might argue that the O\'s invited a certain karmic reaction by letting their steady presence walk elsewhere... and now that has kicked in, as the anagram suggests. Or how about this: A Mac Kink Irks Who was the GM who signed Markakis to his contract extension with the Orioles, the one that ran out at the end of 2014? Oh, yes. It was Andy MacPhail - A Mac! And as for the kink, that\'s obviously the $17.5 million club option the O\'s held on Markakis for the 2015 season that they chose to decline, a decision that clearly irked someone, or something, powerful. So what can they do to get rid of it? Breaking the curse The surest way you know that the Orioles believe in this curse is that they made at least a token inquiry with the Braves about re-acquiring Markakis.\xc2\xa0They were foiled in that. More\'s the pity, because having Markakis back in right field would obviously reverse the curse. Failing that, what else can they do? The ""ride it out"" option has only gotten us where we are now. More drastic measures may be needed. If\xc2\xa0the advice of About.com\'s Paganism/Wicca expert doesn\'t provide all the guidance we need, well, we are truly lost.    Those remedies include placing a mirror in a bowl of black salt, in front of an object of power representing the curse-caster (perhaps a Markakis jersey?) and smashing that mirror with a hammer while saying their name. They remind you, and so shall I, to wear safety glasses. Or perhaps a poppet would do the trick? Take a small doll to represent the Oriole Bird, then follow the ritual as prescribed in order to draw the curse into the poppet and away from the Orioles. Other suggestions include magical bindings, spellbreaking talismans, purifying baths, and calling forth an ""uncrossing"" spell by reciting the 37th Psalm in its original Hebrew. Well, obviously. Why didn\'t I think of that? And just as obviously, all of the above is a whole lot of bunk, but I would rather the Orioles try any of those methods before trading for Jay Bruce and holding him up as any kind of answer in right field. A guy who\'s batted .222/.288/.406 over the past two seasons is cursed before he ever gets here. There does not seem to be any help coming, so O\'s fans can only hope that one way or another, the answer on who will break the curse is already here. Unfortunately, the O\'s attempts to address this deficiency did not bear any fruit, not for lack of their trying to throw money at it. It\'s too late for anyone positive to come in from outside the organization.    At least, even if O\'s right fielders are bad again, this year they\'ve only spent money on those players, instead of spending multiple pitching prospects to end up with a bunch of failures. That is progress in its own depressing way.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles sign Pedro Alvarez to one year contract worth up ...', "" The Orioles finally got ... well, not exactly an outfielder, but they got somebody on Monday night. That would be Pedro Alvarez, who they have signed pending physical and assuming there is not a surprise decision for Alvarez to return to his old team. We can't be too sure of anything any more this offseason.    MLB Network's Joel Sherman was the first to report on the terms of the deal, which will cover one year for $5.75 million in guaranteed money, with up to $1.5 million worth of performance bonuses for the 29-year-old Alvarez. Those bonuses are typically for plate appearances reached; when the exact numbers are revealed you'll probably be looking at something like $500,000 for 500 PA, another $500,000 for 600 PA, and again for 700 PA - or something of that sort. So unless there are any surprises, Alvarez will be an Oriole. Now here's the thing: What the heck do they need with Alvarez? The guy is a career .236/.309/.441 hitter, a lefty slugger who basically has one thing going for him, which is namely that he has hit 27+ home runs in three of the past four seasons. As you'd expect for a left-handed batter whose listed weight on Baseball Reference is 250 pounds ... well, actually, he isn't horrid against lefty pitchers, or at least he wasn't in 2015 with a .258/.292/.419 batting line. OK, it's a horrid on-base percentage, but that's the game with Alvarez. It looks like the Pirates tried their best to completely hide him against lefties, as he only recorded 65 PA.    For all that the O's and O's reporters keep trotting out that the O's need a lefty to balance out their lineup, the team already has a number of righty batters who are better against righty pitchers. They were collectively a disaster against left-handed pitching last season despite a righty-heavy lineup. Alvarez added to the roster will set up a similar situation.    The good news is, if you're going to completely stink against one hand of pitcher, it might as well be lefties, because there are fewer of them out there. Also, Alvarez is horrible defensively, like -14 runs by Defensive Runs Saved as a first baseman, which is actually really hard to do. Designated hitter, surely... right? They couldn't possibly have any designs of him playing the field... could they? They wouldn't do that to us.    Oh, and you already know he strikes out like a bazillion times. He struck out 131 times in 491 PA - that's a 26.4% strikeout rate, actually one of the lower numbers of his career. Alvarez will take a walk a decent amount of time, just about 10% in three of the last four seasons, but his batting average is just so horrible that it even a 10% walk rate only gets his OBP just so high. It'll be like having Mark Reynolds all over again, except this time mashing taters onto the short porch in right field. I do like taters. It must be so nice to be as rich as a baseball owner so you've just got $7 million burning a hole in your pocket that you've just got to spend on a guy who doesn't really fit a ton on your baseball team. That's the good life right there. Must be pretty nice to be Alvarez too, clearing $5.75 in guaranteed salary after being worth 0.1 fWAR the previous season.    Is Mark Trumbo going to play in right field? Is Chris Davis? I don't know. There's three-plus weeks left to worry about all of that stuff. Put him at designated hitter, bench him against every lefty, and let him never play the field. Then every opposing pitcher will be pitching in the dark for the entirety of the season. The dingers will blot out the sun.

After the 2012 season in which the Birds returned to the post season for the first time since 1997, I remember being shocked that they managed to keep him on the roster all year.

After two years, the Blazers say, Connaughton can petition to have that condition reconsidered.That is why he continues to play catch. Peterson and Chris Correnti, an Orioles trainer who has worked closely with Martinez and Johan Santana, gave Connaughton the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standard off-season throwing program to follow in his free time.

03/08/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Seeing the Devil in the Clause', 'The Baltimore Orioles have a firm stance against the Opt-Out Clause. Is it time other teams follow suit before its too late?The Baltimore Orioles have had a few criticisms this Off-Season, one of which is their unwillingness to sign ballplayers looking to include an Opt-Out Clause in their contract. Unfortunately, these clauses are becoming increasingly popular, especially in contracts involving high profile players. Zack Greinke is the most recent to have a successful use of this clause, well successful for him not Los Angeles. With his success, I fear it may become even more popular and begin trending into lower tier player signings.There are a variety of opinions throughout baseball in regards to the use of the Opt-Out clause. My opinion is the same one shared by both the Baltimore Orioles and Rob Manfred. This past December Manfred was quoted as saying \xe2\x80\x9cThe logic of opt-out clauses for the club escapes me,\xe2\x80\x9d as told to Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports. \xe2\x80\x9cYou make an 8-yr agreement with a player. He plays well, and he opts out after three. You either pay the player again or you lose him\xe2\x80\x9d.As fans we\xe2\x80\x99re more likely to see the game through the eyes of the players because we romanticize with the All-American baseball dream. Growing up, not many young baseball fans dream of owning or running a professional Baseball team but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we can\xe2\x80\x99t sympathize with a clubhouse when they\xe2\x80\x99re being taken advantage of. Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireI stand behind Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s firm stance against them and hope the new Collective Bargaining Agreement finds a way to subdue their use, although unlikely. With that being said, I would like to start this discussion by briefly describing the details of the Opt-Out so that fans understand what teams are getting themselves into.The Opt-Out Clause is merely the use of including a loop-hole in a player\xe2\x80\x99s contract that allows them to extract themselves from an existing agreement to take advantage of an inflated market. So in essence, if a team would like to have to renegotiate with, an already overpaid, player in the middle of their commitment and either pay them grossly more or lose them than include the clause.Some may argue that the benefit for a club is that if, for example Zack Greinke, were to under-perform over the next few years that the Dodgers were lucky to have included the clause because it gave them the out, although in reality that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t under their control. The way I see it, if Los Angeles was concerned with the latter half of Greinkes\xe2\x80\x99 contract they should have either not signed him or signed him to a shorter agreement.

In 2000 he signed a $252 million dollar 10-yr deal. After 7 years Rodriguez opted out of his contract in the middle of the World Series, one of many classless actions to follow the remainder of his career, all with the Yankees. Another 10-yrs and $275 million dollars later, we all have seen how this has worked out.Most recently it was Zack Greinke to opt-out of his contract with the LA Dodgers. After singing a $147 million dollar contract he chose to opt-out after three years and test the open market for a larger contract after over performing from 2013-2015. It worked out for him as the Arizona Diamondbacks signed Greinke for a 6-yr $206.5 million dollar contract. Good for him and I hope it works out for the Diamondbacks, but I do not respect the use.My major problem with the opt-out clause is the lack of commitment and respect on the player\xe2\x80\x99s side. A ball-club goes out of their way to sign a large contract, often times thru to the players least productive years based on age, and the player doesn\xe2\x80\x99t chose to commit equally to the club. This also affects the fans, those that pay the bills, by allowing the excitement and fan following to develop and support both the player and the team just to have the rug pulled out from beneath them.The opt-out clause only benefits the player because if the player under-performs or gets injured, the team doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get the option to opt-out of the players contact. They\xe2\x80\x99re stuck with the bill as the player conveniently goes to the pot and never shows back up to the table. It\xe2\x80\x99s a complete lack of respect for a contract.As a fan, if Baltimore would have included an opt-out in Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 contract, which he didn\xe2\x80\x99t and is a better man than to, and he would have opted out after two or three years, I would be absolutely furious and insulted personally and for the entire Orioles organization who worked so hard to keep him.Everyone knows the current Collective Bargaining Agreement ends with the completion of the 2016 season. I personally would like to see this issue acknowledged. The most likely scenario is that the use of this clause will only grow and most likely start being used in lower tier players as well. If this becomes the case than we may as well throw contracts and commitments right out the window and let players do whatever they want.There would never be a player signing ever if ball-clubs were to include an option to release a player from a contract, in similar fashion, if that player were to under-perform or become injured. So why is it alright for a player to do the same thing? Baseball is seeing more money filtering into the game in years and a resurgence in popularity since the strike jeopardized everything. Allowing opt-out clause will challenge the current balance of power between players and teams and most certainly risks a worst case scenario. Next: Baltimore Orioles Sign Pedro AlvarezThankfully the Orioles have shown they won\xe2\x80\x99t do business with a player who would like a chance to opt-out. I hope this continues and other clubs follow suit. The only way to stamp it out is for all teams to get on board and put it to an end before it becomes a virus. As fans, what are your thoughts?

Puskar, AP)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORESARASOTA, Fla. \xe2\x80\x93 Disruption has been a way of life the past few years in Baltimore Orioles camp, and Tuesday morning, the club grappled with the reality that yet another cog will be added even as the calendar dips deeper into March.And unlike a recent near-transaction, Pedro Alvarez will show up.After reports surfaced late Monday that Baltimore and the power-hitting Alvarez agreed to terms on a one-year deal, the Orioles woke up Tuesday morning to a club whose dynamics had been altered significantly.Pitching and defense? This year, it appears the home run \xe2\x80\x93 lots of them - will be the weapon of choice in Baltimore. .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; } .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; } .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; } .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; } p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  } p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYPhillies future in the hands of top prospect J.P. CrawfordAlvarez, first baseman Chris Davis,\xc2\xa0center fielder Adam Jones, third baseman Manny Machado and right fielder Mark Trumbo give the Orioles five everyday players who have hit at least 33 home runs in a season. Even if the quintet fails to maximize their power, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good bet the Orioles will boost their 2015 homer total of 217, and perhaps come closer to the neighborhood of their division rival Toronto Blue Jays, who slugged a major league high 232 homers last year.\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a lot of power potential on this team now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davis, the two-time American League home run champ who smacked 47 long balls in 2015, and then returned to the Orioles on a seven-year, $161 million contract. \xe2\x80\x9cWe did before, and we just keep adding to it. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s excited to finally have a place to call home and get after it.\xe2\x80\x9dAlvarez\xe2\x80\x99s agreement with the club - a one-year deal for $5.75 million, according to the New York Post -\xc2\xa0will have a domino effect on the roster, largely because of Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s defensive inadequacies. The second overall pick in the 2008 draft, Alvarez, 29, played his way from third base to first base to a future as a designated hitter after the Pittsburgh Pirates did not tender him a contract this winter.So significant are Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s glove woes that he lasted on the market this long, even though he produced 30- and 36-homer seasons before he turned 27. Now 29, Alvarez will be entrenched as the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 DH, though his lifetime .203 average against left-handers will likely compel manager Buck Showalter to sit him in many of those situations.That will push Trumbo, a trade acquisition, to right field, a far from ideal scenario for a player best served at first base. Davis has played right field, but he said Tuesday he expects to remain at first, even with Showalter\'s penchant for lineup manipulation. .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; } .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; } .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; } .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; } p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  } p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYFirst look: Keys to winning the AL pennantShowalter would not confirm or deny any agreement with Alvarez, who was expected in Orioles camp for his physical Tuesday,\xc2\xa0but noted that Davis will stick at first base regardless.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to shake things up a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Buck, it can be a coin flip sometimes. Having three guys that have played first, a little bit outfield, third \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Mark\xe2\x80\x99s played third \xe2\x80\x93 it gives Buck a lot of options.\xe2\x80\x9dTrumbo, at 6-4, 225 pounds and a first baseman most of his career, has struggled as an outfielder.\xc2\xa0Showalter said Trumbo was told at the outset of spring to be prepared for versatility, and that Trumbo was out at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday morning fielding fly balls. He had a pair of singles in a 5-1 Grapefruit League loss to Boston on Tuesday that dropped Baltimore\'s record to 0-8-1.Like\xc2\xa0many others in this lineup, Trumbo can lose plenty of balls over the fence \xe2\x80\x93 paired with a fair amount of strikeouts.Acquired in an offseason trade with Seattle, Trumbo has averaged 31 home runs per 162 games in his career, with 32- and 34-homer seasons in 2012-13. He also struck out 153 and 184 times those years.Alvarez, meanwhile, led the National League with 36 home runs in 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 and also led the circuit with 186 strikeouts. Davis\xe2\x80\x99s major league-leading home run total last year came with an MLB-high 208 strikeouts, and struck out 199 times when his 53 home runs led the majors in 2013.That will be the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 identity \xe2\x80\x93 swings, misses, long balls, moving parts, and hopefully not too many outfield misplays. It\xe2\x80\x99s a decidedly different look than what Dexter Fowler \xe2\x80\x93 a speedy, above-average defender \xe2\x80\x93 would have provided them had he and the club reached agreement on a three-year deal last month.""Another power bat, in a hitter\'s ballpark. Not completely surprised,"" says Boston Red Sox manager John Farrell, whose club played the Orioles on Tuesday at Ed Smith Stadium. ""Buck\'s teams have always been filled with power.\xc2\xa0Pedro\'s a guy with 30-+ homer capability.

And, if Hyun-Soo Kim continues to show he needs some AAA experience, it makes it even more likely that Flaherty could be a corner outfielder.The other plus is that by starting him in the outfield, it allows the team the flexibility if he would need to play for an infielder who got hurt.\xc2\xa0 The team doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really have a backup second baseman who is major league ready, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t see Flaherty and Paul Janish both make the team, even under the most recent of circumstances.Next: Young Guys Looking Good In SarasotaHowever, Flaherty just might be playing himself into an Opening Day starting spot, as he watches those around him struggle.As for the rest of the team, it would be nice to get a win!

He failed to beat out rookie Derek Carr a couple seasons ago and joined the Ravens last offseason.He was given an opportunity to play this season when Flacco went down with a torn ACL and MCL. He did little in his two starts, throwing three touchdowns and four interceptions, and Jimmy Clausen and Ryan Mallett finish out the season for the Ravens.Many thought that last season would be the end of his career, but he rejoins Mike Shanahan in Atlanta and has a good chance of sticking around as the backup. Matt Simms and Sean Renfree are currently the quarterbacks behind Ryan.Schaub was also rumored to potentially join the Denver Broncos, where former Texans coach Gary Kubiak is now at the helm.

Mandatory Credit: Butch Dill-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles announced the addition of Pedro Alvarez, now how will he be used to best benefit within a powerful lineup?At the press conference related to the signing on Thursday, Buck Showalter spoke about the possibilities. While Alvarez is largely seen as a terrible liability in the field (supported by varied defensive metrics), the O\xe2\x80\x99s manager did not rule out having El Toro occasionally at a position \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cSome people don\xe2\x80\x99t realize this is an athletic guy who\xe2\x80\x99s got potential to give us a lot of options around the field.\xe2\x80\x9dThat does not sound encouraging. And while I suppose he will perhaps very occasionally be at first base, there is no doubt that Alvarez is going to be primarily a designated hitter, particularly against right-handed pitching.If he is used as the DH in games against RHP, how many will that likely be?\xc2\xa0 Looking back at the past four years from 2012-2015 the numbers are 118, 109, 121, and 117.\xc2\xa0 So it is likely that the Orioles will face about 115 right-handed starters. Of course, left-handed relief pitching can often follow a righty starter.Another Showalter quote was to state that he might use Alvarez as well against left-handed pitching, saying \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in setting limitations about him being a DH against right-handed pitching \xe2\x80\xa6 He\xe2\x80\x99s shown the ability to damage against left-handed pitching too.\xe2\x80\x9dReally?\xc2\xa0 Is this true, or is it Buck being a nice, positive guy at the introductory press conference? Honestly, Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s splits are not great over his career versus LHP.\xc2\xa0 Here is a chart, looking first at his career numbers \xe2\x80\xa6CareerPAHRAVGOBPVs. RHP2161114.246.320Vs. LHP62317.203.270\xc2\xa0That is not very good against lefties. So where is Buck seeing anything about \xe2\x80\x9cdamage\xe2\x80\x9d against LHP?\xc2\xa0 Maybe it was just this most recent season, which looks rather different \xe2\x80\xa62015PAHRAVGOBPVs. RHP42624.240.322Vs. LHP653.258.292\xc2\xa0Again, his home run power is massively diminished against LHPs. But in 2015 his average was better; though strangely, the OBP remained much better against right-handers. Weird!So what does this all say?\xc2\xa0 Probably it is better to mostly only use him against right-handed starters, which will be in about 70-75% of games. Likely a better DH choice can be used against LHP starters, unless Alvarez has a specifically good matchup record against a particular left-handed pitcher.Looking more broadly, how will Alvarez help the Orioles with DH stats and numbers as compared to recent seasons? Let\xe2\x80\x99s seek to graph this as well. First is Pedro in 2015 (150 games), whereas the second row is Alvarez averaged over a 162-game season.

The Orioles addition of Pedro Alvarez was no exception. From every angle came a barrage of positive thinking: From Dan Duquette, that the Orioles were able to sign Alvarez; from Buck Showalter, seeming pleased to be able to put another power hitter in the lineup; and from Alvarez himself, getting to join a lineup that is chock full of sluggers already.    It\'s enough to make the resolve waver for even a dedicated pessimist like myself. I know better than to believe that there\'s something magical or special in the fact that a number of his new teammates came to Alvarez\'s introductory press conference, and yet, when I read that Alvarez went on the radio and\xc2\xa0said he was touched by the gesture, I wanted to give that little Showalter smile and say, ""I like our guys."" Never mind that earlier this week I was\xc2\xa0on this very website proclaiming that, for the Orioles to have signed Alvarez, owner Peter Angelos must have just had $7 million sitting in his pocket looking for an excuse to spend it because Alvarez doesn\'t seem to add much to the roster. Not only does he not add much, but his presence, by virtue of his likely being limited to designated hitter, seems like it will force the O\'s into using a less than ideal defensive alignment if they want to maximize their capabilities on offense. Those things are still true. None of the objective facts of his career to date are any different than they were last week, when Alvarez dangled out there on the free agent market for any team to sign, same as he had been doing since November.    So why does it feel any different? Maybe one reason, at least for me, is that the Alvarez who showed up in front of the media in Sarasota did not match the idea of Alvarez that existed in my head. Having read about Alvarez\'s tenure in Pittsburgh, I had imagined some surly and stubborn guy. Behind the bearded visage in pictures of him looked to be someone going through the motions with grim determination.    That\'s not who sat down in front of the cameras in Sarasota yesterday. Alvarez sounded like a guy who was happy to be there. Clean-shaven, in accordance with the O\'s policy, what was once a dour countenance looked joyful.  I\'m confident that I can bring a lot of help to this team and that\'s the reason why I\'m here.-Pedro Alvarez   You could almost talk yourself into believing maybe he just needed a change of scenery from Pittsburgh, where he\'d fallen out of favor - and why not be happy to show up on the team with his old Vanderbilt roommate Ryan Flaherty, drafted 40 picks after Alvarez all the way back in 2008, now reunited on the same team eight years later? A player being ""happy to be here"" is completely meaningless, until it\'s not. As that old Yogi Berra-ism goes, ninety percent of the game is half-mental.    More than one veteran Orioles player has spoken of their recent success and the way that they feel closer to one another because they were like the misfits and outcasts from other teams. More were traded here or signed off the scrap heap than anything else. Alvarez, at a $5.75 million guaranteed price tag, wasn\'t exactly a bargain basement find along the lines of Miguel Gonzalez, nor was he a waiver wire grab like Darren O\'Day. He is an outcast, though, cast away as a non-tender by the team that once drafted him #2 overall because his projected salary of $8 million was more than they wanted to pay him. He joins a tribe that knows that feeling. He is one of them. Getting non-tendered is a heck of a snub, especially for a guy who had just posted the best full season OPS (.787) of his career to date. Not only was he snubbed by the Pirates who didn\'t want him back, he was also snubbed by every other team in the big leagues.    If every team, or many teams, believes that a player is going to perform well on a one-year contract, he\'s not going to be jobless until March 10, as Alvarez was. For that matter, if Alvarez was the O\'s first choice, or second or third choice, he would have been wearing orange and black long before the start of spring training. Believing even when you know better The rational part of my brain is fully aware of that reality at all times. Acting like it\'s a good idea because of a bunch of ephemeral stuff about feelings and clubhouse chemistry is nonsense. When Orioles broadcaster Jim Hunter came on MASN before Alvarez\'s press conference yesterday and proclaimed that he ""has had a tremendous career up to this point,"" that\'s nonsense too. If you\'ve had a tremendous career and you\'re not hurt, you don\'t get non-tendered over $8 million! This fact is inescapable. If Alvarez was that good, the Pirates would have kept him, even with some defensive liabilities. Or some other team would have signed him long before now. If Alvarez ""always seemed to be a good fit for the Orioles,""\xc2\xa0as Sun beat writer Eduardo Encina wrote yesterday, he wouldn\'t have had Orioles teammates at his introductory press conference because the signing would have happened in Baltimore in the middle of winter. Where\'s the fun in giving in to that reality, though? This is spring training, for crying out loud, where, even if the Orioles are thus far winless, all things are possible. The successful Orioles teams of the past two even years managed to win almost in defiance of any kind of rational expectation or analysis. None of the opinion-generating barnacles who cling to the hull of baseball saw that coming, either time. A whole lot of castaways made winners out of themselves.    No one has any idea whether they\'re going to do that again. They might not. But now it\'s March and March is more fun when you\'re believing. With the Orioles now on a streak of four straight non-losing seasons, no one who believes in them is a fool any more. We are removed from the days having to talk ourselves into teams with Vladimir Guerrero the cleanup hitter and Kevin Gregg the closer. There are negatives to Alvarez. There\'s no denying that. He\'ll strike out a lot while hitting for a low average. He should probably never play in the field and almost certainly should never hit against a left-handed pitcher. Part of what fueled his career-best OPS last year was being hidden from lefties almost entirely, with only 65 PA last season. There will also be a whole lot of dingers. Thanks to Oriole Park at Camden Yards, he may even hit more than he\'s ever hit before. Being in a loaded Orioles lineup where he\'s the fourth- or fifth-biggest power threat instead of the second-biggest surely won\'t hurt either. The baggage of being a disappointing high first round pick will not follow him here. No one cares. The Orioles didn\'t draft him. The signing could end horribly. But for now, it\'s more fun to believe it won\'t, so with the most Baltimore of accents, an excited proclamation: Welcome to dee Oreos, El Toro!  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
03/12/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Tracking Home Runs and Strikeouts', 'Mar 8, 2016; Sarasota, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Chris Davis (19) looks on as he strikes out during the third inning against the Boston Red Sox at Ed Smith Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThere is no doubt that the Baltimore Orioles of 2016 are going to hit a lot of home runs while also striking out a great deal. Could they set either franchise records or MLB records for each?Several months ago when entering the beginning of the 2015-2016 offseason, it would have been unimaginable to believe what has now transpired.First there was the acceptance of the qualifying offer by Matt Wieters, done by a Scott Boras client.Next the Orioles secured Mark Trumbo, a power hitter who would likely replace the improbable re-signing of Chis Davis. But Davis did end up back with the Orioles with a record-setting contract.And then this past week we see the additional signing of Pedro Alvarez. Orioles beat writers and bloggers alike all laughed at the improbable prospect of he and Davis being a part of the same lineup, imagining not only the incredible home run potential, but also the record-setting possibilities of the strikeout totals.In terms of home runs, add to the names already mentioned the historical power numbers of Adam Jones and (as seen in 2015) Manny Machado. Though not seen the past couple seasons, J.J. Hardy has hit for power in multiple seasons. And on the cutting edge is the high-ceiling potential of Jonathan Schoop. Beyond all of this, other role players and backups can all drive the ball: Caleb Joseph, Nolan Reimold, Ryan Flaherty, Hyun Soo Kim, etc.In terms of strikeouts, it is not like the Orioles have not previously had some ignominious numbers in this category in the past. Remember the one-two punch(out) of Chris Davis and Mark Reynolds? There is a well-worn path from the plate to the O\xe2\x80\x99s dugout at OPACY by the bulk of the lineup.So what are the chances of either the franchise or MLB records in home runs and strikeouts being broken by the 2016 Orioles? They are both attainable.HOME RUN RECORDSThe franchise record for home runs is 257 by the 1996 Orioles, just seven shy of the all-time MLB record by the Seattle Mariners a year later.

Beyond this were five players with over 20 homers each: Bobby Bonilla (28), Cal Ripken (26), Chris Hoiles (25), Roberto Alomar (22), B.J. Surhoff (21).\xc2\xa0 That kind of spread is imaginable with Davis at the top and the mid-20s or more from at least five others.The \xe2\x80\x9997 Mariners were led by Ken Griffey, Jr. with 56 and with Jay Buhner driving 40.\xc2\xa0 The latter is likely lesser-known to many O\xe2\x80\x99s fans, but let me tell you that guy could drive a baseball, hitting 124 homers in a three-year span!STRIKEOUT RECORDSThe O\xe2\x80\x99s franchise record for strikeouts in a year was set just this past season with 1,331. This is well short of the MLB record of 1535 by the Houston Astros.\xc2\xa0 That is a very big number! But then again, all it will take to get to that number is a bit more than a strikeout per game this year than last year.Chris Davis was the leading Orioles strikeout king in 2015 with 208. Machado and Paredes tallied 111 each, with Adam Jones also in triple digits at 102.The Astros\xe2\x80\x99 huge number in 2013 was topped by 212 K\xe2\x80\x99s from Chris Carter, with contributions of 130 and 127 from Jason Castro and Brian Barnes.With the probability of high number in both of these categories, throughout the 2016 season here on The Baltimore Wire we will keep track of the pace of the Orioles relative to these statistics. For example, if the Orioles have over 500 strikeouts in the first 54 games (exactly one-third of a season), we will know that are on their way to challenging the all-time strikeout record.

I think that Gonzalez would have to pitch this poorly, if not more so, the rest of spring to be in danger of losing his spot in the starting rotation. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a fact, just an opinion. But with that said, how much rope does he (or anyone for that matter) get once the regular season begins?I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned this previously, however I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it again. The Orioles will have a day off in week one of the season. That means that they don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have to break camp with a five-man rotation. In fact unless he does a total about-face, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me in the least to see Gonzalez start the season in the bullpen.That would probably make him the long man in the \xe2\x80\x98pen for that first week, and potentially give him the opportunity to throw his bullpen side session in the form of pitching in a game. While that might not be ideally what Gonzalez would want, it would give him a chance to get his confidence up a bit in the \xe2\x80\x98pen.

If you remember, whereas the Orioles aimed to hit every pitch out of the park, Minnesota countered that with small ball.

It was going to be perfect. An already established outfielder? Check. A batter with good on-base numbers to move Manny Machado down the line up? Check. A base-runner with above average speed to keep you honest? Check.That\xe2\x80\x99s what the Orioles need. When that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out for Dexter Fowler, it was back to the drawing board. That resulted in the newest Orioles acquisition, Pedro Alvarez\xc2\xa0, about as opposite as you can get.The Orioles needed an outfielder. The trade for Mark Trumbo early in the off-season and the resigning of Chris Davis\xc2\xa0meant that the first base position and DH role\xc2\xa0were\xc2\xa0filled. Signing Alvarez gives the team a third player for those roles. Alvarez started off his career as a third baseman and when his defensive issues became too much of an issue he \xc2\xa0moved to first base last year. The defensive issues didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any better across the diamond. He led all first baseman in errors and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t close. Alvarez committed 23 errors at first the next closet was 11. You could double the that amount and it would still be less than the 23.No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect Pedro Alvarez to be the Orioles first baseman. He will\xc2\xa0setting up as the regular DH. The problem with that is it leaves Mark Trumbo to now play the field. Trumbo is a better first baseman than he is corner outfielder. The team has talked up his arm during spring training with how strong it is. Well that\xe2\x80\x99s great. Let me know when he get\xe2\x80\x99s to the ball to show it off. Hopefully for the Orioles, it will consist of a lot of David Ortiz base-running. I think the best option would be playing Davis out in right. Both the Orioles and Chris have stated he is the team\xe2\x80\x99s first baseman and he would still see time there, but the days with him, Alvarez, and Trumbo in the line up, Davis would be the best outfield option.Live Feed pedro alvarezMLB trade rumors: 5 moves the Yankees should make FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Does Trumbo's return put O's atop AL East DH rankings?

The Baltimore WireBoston Red Sox: Who is next in line to fill DH position? BoSox InjectionThe reason Davis would still be able to see time at first is because Alvarez has huge platoon splits. For his career against left-handed pitching, Alvarez is a .203/.270/.332 hitter. Ideally the days the Orioles face a lefty, Alvarez should start the game on the bench. He is a better .246/.320/.473 hitter against righties. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the Orioles got him. Alvarez and his left-handed bat have a chance to thrive in Camden Yards. According to ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa0ball park ranking, Alvarez is going from the 26th best park to hit in to the 7th best park, in OPACY. It\xe2\x80\x99s especially strong for left-handers. The Orioles played 117 games against right-handed starters compared to only 45 left-handed starters. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say they do something similar again that means Alvarez could start roughly 70% of the time at DH leaving Trumbo the first-baseman those days. Davis\xc2\xa0would play in right during those games at start at first the other 30%. That\xe2\x80\x99s not including days off and injuries but just a estimate. Plus Davis would see more time at first during games when defensive replacements occur. If the Orioles are winning a game 6-3 in the 7th inning than you could remove Trumbo, move Davis back to first, and insert a better defensive outfielder in right.Pedro Alvarez brings awesome left-handed power to the team. Even if he plays around the 70% time, 30 home-runs should still be very reasonable. As stated above this ballpark should only help his numbers. The other thing going for him is not having to worry about his errors and fielding. Alvarez will get the occasional spot start at first just to keep him interested but most of his time will be spent being the regular DH. He can concentrate on hitting. Being left-handed it would seem he balances out the line-up which is filled with more right-handers. The Orioles though, were already better against righties than lefties. As a team the Orioles on-base/slugging was .752 against right-handers and only .664 against left-handers. That .88 points is a huge difference. Alvarez will help bring up the .752 number but the .664 isn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere. So even though he brings more balance to the number of left/right hitter in the line-up the numbers were already skewed towards needing a better that could hit lefties.More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal2/17 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Johnson wants to revitalize his careerThe other issue surrounding Alvarez is he won\xe2\x80\x99t be solving the teams on-base issues or strikeout totals. Alvarez can hit home-runs with the best of them but like most power hitters he strikes out a whole bunch as well. The Orioles already have a lot of those guys on the team like Davis and Trumbo. It also means Manny Machado looks like the team\xe2\x80\x99s lead off hitter again. Manny performs that very well. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to argue a .359 average and 20 stolen-bases from the top spot. The problem lies with the 35 homers being wasted from the one whole. Ideally Manny would move down to the 3# spot at worst the #2 spot so he can drive in more runs and be productive. The Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t have a better option right now.If the Orioles could do it all over again, I wonder if they would have traded for Mark Trumbo. That has nothing to do with thinking Trumbo is a bad player. At the time they had no idea Davis was going to be back.They needed a power bat and potential first-base replacement. Even if Davis comes back, Trumbo moves to DH, where the O\xe2\x80\x99s struggled mightily last year. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they expected to sign Alvarez two weeks into spring training at a reasonable price. But that leads to a lot of redundancy and not solving the problems the team already had.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsIf a key component for success for the Baltimore Orioles in 2016 is a necessary bounceback season from Miguel Gonzalez and Chris Tillman, there is early reason for concern.Chris Tillman takes the mound on Tuesday, and it will be interesting to see if he is ready to progress, or if he is still affected by the early-season injury.Looking at Gonzalez, he has now turned in two horrible starts in his three outings. On Sunday he allowed six runs on seven hits with three walks, all in a mere 1.2 innings of work. He previously yielded seven runs in 1.1 innings in his first spring start and then one run over 2.2 in the middle of his three outings.All of this totals to 14 runs on 18 hits in 6.2 innings, for an ERA of 22.24.\xc2\xa0 How\xe2\x80\x99s that bounceback stuff working out?The 9-12 season of 2015 with a 4.91 ERA is still fresh in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s minds.

Even factoring in the poor results of a year ago, his overall numbers with the Orioles are good: 39-33 / 3.82 / ERA / 1.282 WHIP.Miggy\xe2\x80\x99s story is a great one, essentially being rescued from obscurity and ascending to MLB starter status in a most unexpected way. He does not have the great upside talent of many, including hordes of more-gifted arms who have never accomplished what Gonzalez has done.But for Gonzalez to be good, he has to have it all working at a high level. He is a pitcher, not a thrower. His stuff is not overwhelming. He needs pinpoint control. The umpire needs to help him out on the corners (which apparently did not happen today). But if Gonzalez is not hitting his spots precisely, along with the best stuff his talent brings to the game, the results can go in a poor direction rather quickly.Again, his past success and good character earn him the opportunity to work it out and get back to a sweet place. But how long might it take, and what price might that cost the Orioles of 2016?A concern in the minds of many fans is that Miguel Gonzalez of 2016 will be the second coming of the Bud Norris of 2015. Norris was given an extended chance to overcome a horrible spring, remembering the success of the 2014 season. But clearly he was not well, suffering from an illness that categorically changed his ability to be effective.Honestly, Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s stats in three starts are already worse than Norris\xe2\x80\x99 in four Florida starts last year. Bud threw 11.2 innings, giving up 12 runs on 16 hits \xe2\x80\x94 ERA of 9.26.\xc2\xa0 Norris was only slightly better in 11 starts in the regular season, going 2-9 with an ERA of 7.06.\xc2\xa0 Those losses contributed to building the early hole from which the Orioles never really escaped completely.So, on one hand he deserves a long look, but on the other, the Orioles can\xe2\x80\x99t really afford it.\xc2\xa0 This is a conundrum, also exasperated by the lack of any clear alternative solution. Perhaps Vance Worley is a possibility for a fifth rotation spot? He has at least performed decently. Or Tyler Wilson? He has struggled a bit more this spring.Actually, there are few attractive pitching statistics so far this spring on the Baltimore Orioles, other than the short relievers like Zach Britton, Mychal Givens and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day.Next: Reasons for Hope for O's FansSpeaking of relievers, I will go on record here as saying that the Orioles made their worst move of the year last week in taking Andrew Triggs off the 40-man roster to clear a space for Pedro Alvarez. I\xe2\x80\x99m not down on the Alvarez addition, but losing Triggs is a big mistake. He will be joining the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s. Chaz Roe would have been a better deletion. Triggs has numbers not different at all from Givens, and the day is going to come when there will be regret for losing this talent. "", 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

03/16/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Still All About the Pitching', 'It is March 15, which means we are about halfway through Spring Training. So, let\xe2\x80\x99s examine the Baltimore Orioles.Going into Spring Training, the major concern was going to be the starting pitching. Sure, everyone was wondering who would be the DH, and who would be the corner outfielders.With the signing of Pedro Alvarez, both of those questions are largely answered.Alvarez will primarily be used as DH, either Mark Trumbo or Chris Davis will play in RF, and left field will likely be manned by Nolan Reimold, who had a great catch to save a likely grand slam on Tuesday, or Hyun Soo Kim, who is now batting around .100.The bench has solidified itself. Ryan Flaherty has had the best spring of everyone, and will likely be the utility player. Caleb Joseph will be the backup catcher, one of Kim or Reimold will likely be on the bench, as well as another outfielder, likely Joey Rickard, who has had a very good spring.So, not too worried about the hitting at this point. The O\xe2\x80\x99s offense this spring has not been fantastic, but I think it will be fine.Then there is the pitching.And if you have been reading my pieces long enough, you will know that I think that for the Baltimore Orioles to be successful, it is all about the pitching.I\xe2\x80\x99ll be blunt: It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been pretty.Of those expected to be in the starting rotation, only Kevin Gausman has pitched well. Chris Tillman made his first start Tuesday, and struggled in the first inning. Yovani Gallardo has also struggled in the first innings of his two starts, and has also struggled to keep the ball in the ballpark.Ubaldo Jimenez has been worse than Gallardo, and Miguel Gonzalez has been down right terrible. In fact, it is possible that Gonzalez may be losing his grip on a starting spot.Tyler Wilson and Vance Worley have both shown themselves worthy of getting a look at being a starter. Wilson proved that Tuesday, going 3 1/3 innings, which is tied for the most any Oriole has gone so far this spring.

That does make an all right-handed rotation.The bullpen will return all-stars in closer Zach Britton and set-up man Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day. Brad Brach continues to be one of the more underrated relievers in baseball. Mychal Givens all but has a spot locked after his electric call up last season. Brian Matusz, coming off his best year, is back as the lefty specialist. Left-handed batters produced only a .186 average and .231 on-base against Matusz. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t let him face righties and he is fine. The would leave two spots left in the bullpen but one has to go to Dylan Bundy by default.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he will struggle in any way this year but at times he could used as a way to get a fresh arm up from Norfolk. Before I had assumed Vance Worley would be locked into the last spot. In his career Worley\xc2\xa0has been used both as a starter and a reliever so he has the experience. He could be the long-man that eats innings when one of the starters has an early exit. Worley could also make spot starts if any of the pitchers in the rotation needs a start skipped. Like the other pitchers, not named Givens, he too is out of options so he has to make the team out of spring training. The downfall for Worley could be that he is another right-handed pitcher.Live Feed t.j. mcfarlandArizona Diamondbacks: Walks, early runs allowed dominate Ray's poor outing Venom StrikesArizona Diamondbacks: Corbin struggles, offense stymied by Anderson Venom StrikesArizona Diamondbacks: Offense hits three home runs, Walker inefficient Venom StrikesBaltimore Orioles Bring Tommy Hunter Back for Big Games The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Miscellaneous Monday Musings The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles and the Bullpen Bloat The Baltimore WireThe bullpen does have two left-handed pitchers in Matusz and Britton. The Orioles like to use Matusz against strong lefty types like David Ortiz and Josh Hamilton. Those are just two of the lefties he own. But most of those situations come in the 7th inning or later. Britton obviously is the closer and isn\xe2\x80\x99t being removed from his 9th inning end the game duties anytime soon. With the rotation being full of right-hander\xe2\x80\x99s does the open spot go to another lefty? If an opposing team stacked it\xe2\x80\x99s lineup with left-handed batters due to the all righty rotation, the Orioles could at least flip it around on them by having someone like T.J McFarland in the pen.T.J. McFarland has been up and down with the major league team since being a Rule-5 pick back in 2013. He has made a couple starts for the big league club but besides that has worked as a reliever for the Orioles. When he has been in the minors though, McFarland has worked as a starter. This gives him the needed flexibility to go multiple innings. For his career, McFarland owns a\xc2\xa03.89 ERA but an unsightly 1.52 whip. Against lefties he has fared better. Lefties have hit for a combined\xc2\xa0.266 average and .310 on-base. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0the level of Matusz, but if he can improve\xc2\xa0those numbers even slightly to around .250/.300, than McFarland could be an asset to the bullpen.I will be the first to admit I\xe2\x80\x99m not a huge T.J. McFarland fan. In a perfect world the Oriole\xe2\x80\x99s would have at least one left-handed starter and Dylan Bundy could start the year down in the minors. Unfortunately that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case. That would allow a more proven or even a more upside pitcher to make the bullpen. The way it\xe2\x80\x99s constructed McFarland might make the best bet at this point. If anything another manager might have to go to his bench early if McFarland comes into the game.

I do know this only one spot is open\xc2\xa0but who will it go to?\xc2\xa0 "", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles trade rumors: Rockies wanted Kevin Gausman for ...', ' Not even an outfielder who hit 40 home runs last season was an enticing enough offer for the Orioles to part with Kevin Gausman. In the middle of a solid start to an outing in spring training on Wednesday,\xc2\xa0MLB Network\'s Jon Heyman casually dropped a tweet indicating that the O\'s refused to trade Gausman, ""even for Carlos Gonzalez.""    That\'s a reference to a couple of months ago when the Rockies found themselves with four left-handed hitting outfielders after signing free agent and former Oriole Gerardo Parra. The ultimate result was that the Rockies traded 26-year-old Corey Dickerson to the Rays for reliever Jake McGee and pitching prospect German Marquez. Before that, the O\'s and Rockies were said to be involved in trade discussions involving one of the Rockies outfielders. The others were Gonzalez and Charlie Blackmon. Based on Heyman\'s information, it seems like we can conclude what we already suspected about those trade discussions. They didn\'t work out because the Rockies wanted Gausman, who came from Colorado before he went to LSU, from whence the O\'s drafted him. It would probably have been nice to see Gonzalez in an Orioles uniform for the next couple of seasons. Gonzalez, 30, had that 40-homer season last year while playing in a career-high 153 games. However, he\'s also due to make $37 million over the next two seasons - less of a concern now that we know the O\'s have deeper pockets than realized at the start of the year - and comes with the usual question marks about what\'s Coors Field and what isn\'t.    While Gonzalez\'s 2015 road OPS of .758 isn\'t awful, it\'s not anywhere near his home OPS of .972. He was also very, very bad against left-handed pitching, batting only .195/.222/.308 over 168 PA. Yikes. He is possibly capable of better than these numbers, as he posted only a .284 BABIP in 2015 compared to a .335 mark for his career... but, maybe he\'s lost a step as he\'s approached and passed the dirty 30.    Oh yeah, and the year before last, he played in only 70 games while posting a .723 OPS (and continued his BABIP pattern, at .283), and the year before that he played in only 110 games. That 2013 campaign saw Gonzalez perform phenomenally at the plate - .302/.367/.591, even better on the road than at home, but that\'s a lot of time to miss. Trading five years of Gausman for Gonzalez or either of those other guys would have been the kind of thing that would have led to a figurative mob with torches and pitchforks storming the Warehouse. That would have been completely nuts and probably horrible for the Orioles. But of course that\'s who the Rockies wanted - the O\'s don\'t have very many other enticing names to even contemplate trading.    It seems safe to say that the Rockies had to settle for a lot less than Gausman in the trade they finally made in which they gave up Dickerson. Due to being younger and having more service time remaining, Dickerson might even have been a greater potential prize than Gonzalez was. Yet for that more valuable player, the Rockies only got two years of a reliever and a mid-tier pitching prospect. Marquez is now the #14 prospect in the Rockies system,\xc2\xa0according to MLB.com. Little wonder that the O\'s didn\'t budge at the time. It seems like Gausman is finally in Baltimore to stay, and that sounds good to me.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

He slugged a few home runs against them when he played in Washington, but that\xe2\x80\x99s about it. However he surfaced in the news this week, in what I would call an odd situation.Courtesy of Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY SportsLaRoche of course is the ChiSox\xe2\x80\x99s DH. He abruptly retired this week, citing a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal reason.\xe2\x80\x9d Most people hear that an immediately hope there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with his health or with that of anyone in his family.

LaRoche has a long-standing reputation as one of the good and jovial guys in the game.Yesterday \xe2\x80\x93 one day after his retirement \xe2\x80\x93 reports surfaced such as this\xc2\xa0USA Today article, which I find very interesting. You all have heard of this story by now, but in a nutshell \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent that LaRoche retired because GM Kenny Williams asked him to bring his 14-year old son Drake into the clubhouse less. The term that Williams allegedly used was for LaRoche to \xe2\x80\x9cdial back\xe2\x80\x9d Drake\xe2\x80\x99s time with the team.\xc2\xa0Live Feed adam larocheFor White Sox, hot start is the fulcrum for 2016 Southside ShowdownWill escalating salaries in sports continue to shorten careers?

But Not Yet Tomahawk TakeWhite Sox Morning Rundown Southside ShowdownLet me be up front here; I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any children. I want them for sure, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any right now. So admittedly I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be a working parent and so forth. Furthermore, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be a parent who\xe2\x80\x99s on the road as much as baseball players (or those with kids at least) are. So for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, that\xe2\x80\x99s my point of reference.However my personal opinion is that the team and Kenny Williams are well within their right to do this. As Williams said in the aforementioned USA Today article:\xc2\xa0Tell me where in America you can bring your child to work every day?Willias was also very careful not to flat out ban Drake LaRoche from the clubhouse overall:All I asked him to do it dial it back, that was it. Simply you have to make a decision from management perspective, or an organization at large. We went into this season saying to ourselves, We going to commit and focus and not leave any stone unturned.LaRoche apparently wasn\xe2\x80\x99t willing to \xe2\x80\x9cdial back\xe2\x80\x9d his son\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the clubhouse, so he took the not-previously-known third option and he retired. On one hand, I do respect LaRoche in the sense that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all had issues with the powers that be at our jobs in the past. Furthermore we\xe2\x80\x99ve all heard the phrase\xc2\xa0if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, there\xe2\x80\x99s the door.\xc2\xa0LaRoche apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to comply with the new regulation, so he walked through that door and retired.Furthermore he did it with seemingly little fanfare and took the high road by simply saying it was a personal matter. However in reading up on this situation I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen LaRoche applauded for opting to spend more time with his family as opposed to playing baseball. It\xe2\x80\x99s important that we don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that professional athletes are paid to play \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s literally their job.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

I have no doubt that Adam LaRoche is a great father who just wants to spend time with his son. And that\xe2\x80\x99s laudable. However Kenny Williams is right in that not one employer in America allows employees to have their kids in the workplace 100% of the time. And by all accounts, Drake LaRoche was in the clubhouse everyday.Heck, Williams even said that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t banning Drake. He just asked LaRoche to dial it back. Somehow in LaRoche\xe2\x80\x99s mind it was all or nothing \xe2\x80\x93 so he opted to retire. So you might wonder how any of this applies to the Orioles or how this is anything more than fluff. Funny you should ask that\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s issues such as these which will be big as baseball moves forward. From Ada LaRoche\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, his employer is trying to limit his family time. I personally don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s true, but it\xe2\x80\x99s his perception. But as families change and American life evolves, this type of thing might start becoming more of an issue.I know people (my Dad being one of them) who think it\xe2\x80\x99s insane that baseball offers three days of paternity leave to players if their children are born during the season. While I think it\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous that a player would retire over not being allowed to bring his son in 100% of the time, I do think that paternity leave is a good thing. As I said I\xe2\x80\x99m not a father but I do want children; and you can bet your derriere that when those kids are born I\xe2\x80\x99ll be dropping everything to be there.\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not so much about bringing your kids to work as it is about family issues.

The list of Orioles players likely to be on the 25-Man, that were once acquired via the Rule 5 Draft, include Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Ryan Flaherty, T.J. McFarland, and this year Joey Rickard.Yes, O\xe2\x80\x99Day wasn\xe2\x80\x99t acquired by Baltimore via the Rule 5 but he is a product of the Rule 5 Draft. He was drafted by the Mets in December 2008, and although two weeks into the season he was released, he was then picked up by the Rangers and his career began. Texas is where Baltimore originally gained their interest in the feisty side-armer before picking him up off of waivers in November of 2011, and boy did that work out. His hard work earned him the 4-yr $31 Million dollar contract.O\xe2\x80\x99Day is clearly going to have a huge impact this season, he could quite possibly be considered the best set up man in the AL, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not the only Rule 5 reliever on staff. Baltimore drafted T.J. McFarland in Dec of 2012 from Cleveland as a potential Starting Pitcher. According to Dan Duquette at the time (quote courtesy of\xc2\xa0Brittany Ghiroli\xc2\xa0of mlb.com):We know he has a knack for winning games, and hopefully that knack will translate to the Major Leagues.Now has this happened yet? No not so much but what can be said is he has become stronger and better every year. Although he may not have his chance at starting, he will most likely have a chance to make an impact out of the bullpen. McFarland is the Orioles best choice as a left handed long man whom still has one option left, which, as we saw in 2015 is a hot commodity in Baltimore.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

He is the only true Utility Player that Baltimore has, which makes him very valuable. The only two positions he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t play are Pitcher and Catcher. He\xe2\x80\x99s started out the Spring on fire, second on the team with a .360 avg. His demeanor has also noticeably changed, he finally looms comfortable in his own skin. Of he can carry that into the regular season, he\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be a weapon off the bench.Last but not least, Dan Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbiggest surprise of the Off-Season \xe2\x80\x9c, Joey Rickard.

When I read the news I was ecstatic, knowing exactly what we were getting, and he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t let me down yet.As has been mentioned on numerous occasions but Duquette and Showalter, Rickard has great defensive abilities in every position of the outfield. Baltimore has never had a true back-up for Adam Jones at Center, which largely played a role in the pressure Jones felt to play through injuries. Rickard is no \xe2\x80\x9cOne Trick Pony\xe2\x80\x9d, he also has a great bat and speed to boot. He\xe2\x80\x99s 3rd in Avg this Spring, behind Schoop and Flaherty, and has a Homer and 4 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s and shows no symptoms of allowing down.\xc2\xa0Next: Kevin Gausman Strong as Birds CruiseWith Hyun-Soo Kim finding it difficult to adjust to the MLB and Mark Trumbo still learning the RF position, there\xe2\x80\x99s a very good chance Rickard will find himself given many regular season opportunities to make an impact.

Here he is in the upper level of a franchise that just signed the American League leader in home runs to a long-term contract, while also adding power hitting first basemen in Mark Trumbo and Pedro Alvarez.So how do you get recognized in a situation like that? You just outhit them all!\xc2\xa0 On a day when Alvarez struck out four consecutive times, Walker on Thursday hit a three-run homer for the third consecutive day. Davis is batting .111 and Alvarez .118, while Trumbo is better at .273.For the spring, Walker is now hitting .290 on 9-for-31 with 14 RBIs, along with four homers, three doubles and a triple. Is that good?Walker has come into camp this year in what he has termed as the best condition of his life, having hit the weights hard over the winter along with a disciplined diet.The 2015 season was a bit less than what Walker hoped for, especially after being the O\xe2\x80\x99s Minor League Player of the Year in 2014. At Triple-A Norfolk last year, Walker hit .257 with 18 homers and 74\xc2\xa0RBIs.\xc2\xa0But in the second half of the season, he picked up his power production numbers, while also hitting left-handed pitching at a .306 average with an\xc2\xa0OPS\xc2\xa0of .921.Walker certainly looks ready to for the big leagues, but what are the Orioles to do with him? Every path looks blocked for a long time, while last year\xe2\x80\x99s Minor League Player of the Year Trey Mancini \xe2\x80\x94 another first baseman \xe2\x80\x94 is in the pipeline right behind him.The logical question is to ask if he can play another position of greater need for the Orioles.

And they never really looked back.New York would notch their runs in the second on a two-RBI single by Gregorious. However the Birds and Gonzalez wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be denied on this night. Machado and Trumbo would combine in the fourth to drive in three runs between the two of them, and Machado would also add an RBI-single in the sixth. The O\xe2\x80\x99s would add some additional runs in the later innings, including an RBI-double off of Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s bat.

After struggling mightily thus far in the spring (especially his previous start), he really seemed to right himself last night. I did find it interesting that he was pulled after four innings, however I suspect he reached his pitch count for the night. However this is the point in spring training where starters are beginning to be stretched out just a bit.It was also interesting to see a few additional starters sprinkle into the lineup last night, in a road contest. As I alluded with regard to starting pitchers above, we\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of turned a symbolic corner in terms of spring training. The guys who will be getting the reps in the regular season are starting to get more work in, which means that sometimes the likes of Machado or Trumbo are finding gray pants in their lockers on game days.

03/20/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Pitchers to Worry About Right Now', 'Oct 3, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles catcher Caleb Joseph (36) speaks with starting pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez (31) on the pitching mound during the fifth inning against the New York Yankees at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsWith the spring training season getting serious now for the Baltimore Orioles, it is a very mixed bag of pitchers who look ready for the season and those who appear rather lost.The big worry even before the preseason began revolved around the rotation in particular. And already this is indeed the category of greatest concern for the O\xe2\x80\x99s.As we did yesterday with position players, let\xe2\x80\x99s think about those pitchers on the Birds who appear to be in form and ready to go. Of course, the situation surrounding who will comprise the 12-man staff is a bit less fixed than with the position players.One who will surely be on the roster is Dylan Bundy. After all of the concerns as to if he would be in sufficient form to contribute, he has pitched very effectively in all but one of his appearances.The back end of the bullpen is (not surprisingly) in good shape. Zach Britton, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Mychal Givens and Brad Brach have all been touched-up a bit here and there, but on most occasions they appear ready to take on the 2016 season.Health setbacks have affected both bullpen lefties in T.J. McFarland and Brian Matusz. The latter is particularly behind schedule in making a return. Where this goes is very uncertain.But the Orioles have other options to turn to, though they may not be left-handed. Looking especially good is Oliver Drake, who is yet to be scored upon after six innings of four-hit baseball.Vance Worley is another long relief possibility (if not in the rotation). Though his early numbers are far from stellar, his last outing was extremely good. It would seem that the Orioles need to find a way to include him. The injuries above may make that possible.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoTurning to the starting rotation, the concern grows more acute. Whereas a number of recent starts have been much improved, the jury is not only still out, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been given instructions by the judge.Kevin Gausman has looked the best of the presumed starters, but even there is room for improvement. And Chris Tillman is behind schedule, and today\xe2\x80\x99s start will be a big moment of the spring in assessing where he is at.Miguel Gonzalez, Yovani Gallardo and Ubaldo Jimenez have all had experiences all over the map, probably more poor than good. Jimenez is defined by inconsistencies and probably always will be. He does seem to be tightening the mechanics and getting some decent results. Gallardo is a week or so behind the others due to his late signing. And Gonzalez is only hanging on by a thread. Without his last outing of only two runs on four innings, he might be on the edge of replacement or assignment to AAA to work out whatever is wrong.Tyler Wilson has had the best overall results of starting pitcher types with a 2.89 ERA. As we wrote a few days ago, why should he not be anything but a legitimate candidate for rotation consideration?.theiaPostSlider_nav._lower{display:none !important}Related Story: http://thebaltimorewire.com/2016/03/16/baltimore-orioles-why-not-tyler-wilson-why-not/The major theme for observation over the final two weeks of spring training will likely be that of the starting pitching and how they will be getting aligned for the regular season. Will there ever be a time where this is not an ongoing concern for the Orioles? Probably not. There are so few guarantees with starting pitching.

From the perspective of the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 right-handed starter, it was a lovely day on\xc2\xa0Tillman Island. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4 IP, 5 H, 3 R, 1 BB, 5 K.Tillman did throw two home runs in the third inning, however overall his stuff was crisp and for the most part he hit his spots.

That\xe2\x80\x99s a great sign for the Orioles, as Alvarez was hitting behind Machado in the order (in the two-hole).

The Baltimore WireBlue Jays Easter Optimism Jays JournalTampa would battle back into the game (in what would become a motif) in the third on two aforementioned homers by Morrison (a two-run shot) and Longoria off of Tillman.

That\xe2\x80\x99s been their modus operandi for some time. They managed to load the bases with help from a Machado error (on an unforunate hop), and Souza\xe2\x80\x99s grand slam tied the game at eight.Incidentally, Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s also the type of team that never hesitates to make you pay when you\xe2\x80\x99ve made a mistake. In that case the Orioles gave them an extra out with the Machado error. They took full advantage. A walk here and a base hit there\xe2\x80\xa6and suddenly they had the chance to tie the game. And they did; you can\xe2\x80\x99t give teams extra outs.Another mark of the Tampa Rays is that they\xe2\x80\x99re capable of doing things that are totally unexpected. The Orioles played\xc2\xa0Kean Wong to pull with a runner in scoring position and two outs in the top of the sixth. The scouting reports indicated of course that this was the best way to get Wong out. Instead, Wong hit the ball the opposite way to left field for an RBI-single which gave Tampa an 8-7 lead.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerBut Pedro Avarez wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite done yet.

Tillman showed improvements by leaps and bounds over his previous start, also against Tampa. And we also saw some great things from the likes of Britton and Matusz towards the end of the game.

03/21/2016,"[(""Baltimore Orioles: Beer's still cold after all these years"", 'The Baltimore Orioles had a hall-of-fame announcer in the great Chuck Thompson for years.Today is the lone off day for the Baltimore Orioles during spring training. It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a welcome thing for the players as well as the coaches. Even during the regular season there are 21 off days built in; having one in spring training makes sense as well. Furthermore it gives me the chance to write one of my favorite recurring annual columns.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsEvery spring training I write a tribute to the great Chuck Thompson. As most fans know, Thompson was the voice of the Orioles for years \xe2\x80\x93 in a career that spanned from the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s until the early 2000\xe2\x80\x99s. Thompson called both Orioles as well as Baltimore Colts\xe2\x80\x99 games, along with various bits of national work over the years.Let me be clear; the Orioles have great broadcast teams on both television and radio right now. But I suspect that all of the announcers would say that they\xe2\x80\x99re not in Chuck Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s league. And very few are. His trademarks, ain\xe2\x80\x99t the beer cold!, and go to war, Ms. Agnes! are the stuff of legends in Baltimore, even today. They\xe2\x80\x99re a part of the psyche of the Orioles and their fans.

Thompson actually worked for the National Beer Company, who at that time owned the rights to Senators\xe2\x80\x99 games. Once they purchased the rights to Orioles games, he returned to Baltimore and stayed there for the rest of his career \xe2\x80\x93 save for national work.Thompson received the Ford C. Frick award for broadcasting and was thus inducted into the Hall of Fame. And the award was well-deserved and long-overdue. Speaking for myself, my memories of Chuck Thompson were towards the end of his career. However in listening to the stories of my father and my uncles, I knew that I was listening to a part of baseball history when I\xe2\x80\x99d listen to Thompson call games. He had that smooth delivery and old world charm about his voice. And as time\xe2\x80\x99s gone on, that\xe2\x80\x99s never been lost.

Thompson and his contemporaries (of which Vin Scully is the only one left) were fans\xe2\x80\x99 link to baseball every afternoon or evening. And it\xe2\x80\x99s for that reason that he\xe2\x80\x99s so beloved by fans of all ages to this day. Perhaps announcers aren\xe2\x80\x99t as important now as they were at that time. However Chuck Thompson is as important to the history of the Baltimore Orioles franchise as any player or coach. The way he would emphasize the second O in Orioles, or almost talk backwards in a way (\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6swings from the left side does Eddie Murray\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d). That\xe2\x80\x99s part of the grand tradition of baseball in Baltimore. So speaking for myself, to paraphrase the end of Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s Hall of Fame speech\xe2\x80\xa6when folks ask if I knew Chuck Thompson, I say that I did. He was a friend.

The moment will surely stand out, but it will not be nearly as groundbreaking as the game the Baltimore Orioles played there 17 years ago.That game occurred on March 28, 1999, at a time when the United States\xe2\x80\x99 embargo against Cuba made American business ventures in Cuba virtually impossible. Peter Angelos, the owner of the Orioles, was a strong critic of the economic blockade of the island nation, however, and sought to foster improved relations between the countries through baseball.He had previously been denied requests to take his team to Cuba, but when President Bill Clinton announced an easing of travel restrictions, Angelos, a Clinton donor, appealed again and was granted permission to pursue his idea.Bud Selig, then the baseball commissioner, appointed Sandy Alderson, now the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 general manager but then one of his key deputies, as his point man. Alderson, Angelos and a small contingent of other baseball officials went to Cuba in early March to lay the groundwork for the trip. Weeks later, the Orioles played the Cuban national team, the first time a major league club had been in Cuba in 40 years. Five weeks later, there was a rematch in Baltimore.

In my mind, it was unfortunate and never should have happened. So I felt we had to put all that aside and re-establish the dialogue. I felt the two countries could get together and put behind their differences, and what better way to start than through baseball, the national sport of both countries?\xe2\x80\x9dSANDY ALDERSON, baseball\xe2\x80\x99s point man in the talks with Cuba: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think M.L.B. would have done it without Peter really pushing it. It ended up costing him a lot of money because he had to cover all the losses.\xe2\x80\x9dBRADY ANDERSON, one of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 top players at the time: \xe2\x80\x9cI was for it. I wanted to go play the Cuban team. I had always dreamed of playing internationally, but I never had the chance to play in the Olympics. I knew it was going to be historic, interesting and unprecedented.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Final ApprovalsThe Orioles and Major League Baseball needed permission from the United States government before any game could take place.

We went to the White House and talked with Sandy Berger, who was the national security adviser at the time. We went to the State Department.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to talk anyone into it, but there were clearly different elements of the government with different points of view. It was President Clinton and Peter Angelos who kind of rammed it through.\xe2\x80\x9cThe big issue was, what is going to happen to the revenue? Will it end up benefiting the Castro government? I kept saying, There isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be any revenue because of the cost of the television production, the cost of transporting the players and the upgrade of the stadium and all the accommodations and so forth. And I heard that the average ticket price for the game was, like, 10 cents. Unfortunately, most of the attendees were probably party officials.\xe2\x80\x9dPreparations For Game 1ALDERSON \xe2\x80\x9cESPN had already committed its schedule for the day we were considering. I remember they were willing to clear their schedule, but they weren\xe2\x80\x99t willing to pay for anything, including the cost of the production, which I believe included bringing the equipment in from Florida.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cThere were things that we were prohibited from bringing in that had to be brought from Canada; outfield padding, for instance. The whole stadium had to be upgraded, the turf, the dirt infield.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cBecause of the sanctions, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring in anything that was going to stay in the country. Everything you brought in had to stay with you, or if it stayed in Cuba, it had to be licensed or come from a third country. So a lot of the supplies, especially the groundskeeping equipment and supplies, came from Canada.\xe2\x80\x9dCuba Prepares, TooDANILO VALIENTE, now a Yankees coach, then the third-base coach for the Cuban national team (he spoke last week through an interpreter): \xe2\x80\x9cBefore the game, we were worried because in our league, we don\xe2\x80\x99t use wooden bats. We only had about 10 to 15 days to practice with wooden bats. There were a lot of expectations for us from the fans. They wanted us to do good and show our talent.

Cookie Rojas was the third-base coach of the Mets at the time. Bobby Valentine was the manager of the Mets, and Rey Ordonez, a Cuban defector, was the team\xe2\x80\x99s shortstop. The Cuban-born Rafael Palmeiro was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 designated hitter.COOKIE ROJAS \xe2\x80\x9cI strongly disagreed with the decision because I did not want anything to support Castro. I thought it was a bad idea, so I decided to sit out in protest. I talked to Bobby Valentine and told him my feelings, and he said he respected my position and that he understood.

Steinbrenner Field. Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY SportsBefore the Baltimore Orioles begin their final 10 spring training games, the team has an off day for us to ponder their current status with some miscellaneous musings.The past week has given Orioles fans some overall better hopes for the coming season. They have been 5-2-2 over the last nine games, evidencing the resident power in the lineup and putting up some better pitching statistics.It is not as if everything is perfect \xe2\x80\xa6 it never is. There are always a few players struggling through slumps or physical ailments. This is a part of the game that fans have to live with.The latest ailment to hear about is Kevin Gausman, who is getting a cortisone injection to deal with inflammation in the shoulder. The extent and gravity of the situation is unknown, as he\xe2\x80\x99ll be shut down for about three days. This would seem to raise legitimate concern, especially relative to a rotation that is already quite shaky at best. To hear Showalter and the O\xe2\x80\x99s talk about this injection, it almost sounds like taking a vitamin C tablet when feeling a sore throat \xe2\x80\xa6 nothing more serious than that. It makes me want to go out and get one of these injections for my sore shoulder that has been hurting since shoveling after the blizzard a few weeks ago.Another pitcher of concern has been Chris Tillman. He seems healthy enough now, as his velocity was very good in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s start against the Rays. Somehow, yielding three runs in four innings is being called a good start for him. Yes, it was only two pitches that hurt him, giving up back-to-back home runs. I want to hope for the best for Tillman to be the pre-2015 version, but the fastball continues to have practically no movement, and the curve does not entice anyone to very often chase it. I believe this situation with Tillman could go either way.

McFarland\xe2\x80\x99s numbers from Sunday look far worse than he did in reality. Giving up a grand slam with a 7-3 lead was not a good moment. It was an awful pitch. At age 61, I could have hit it. But T.J. deserved a better fate all around on Sunday. Everything else he gave up was junk hits, along with an error by Manny. In spite of the numbers, McFarland looked decent to me.Speaking of looking good, Zach Britton simply has amazing stuff. Unlike Tillman, he has such great movement on his pitches, and he can afford to miss a spot without having to pay for it. In Britton\xe2\x80\x99s one inning of 1-2-3 work, he faced three batters, threw nine consecutive strikes and recorded three strikeouts. It was almost unfair. The three hitters were all minor leaguers who had no real chance, guys with career minors batting averages of .257, .249 and .245.\xc2\xa0 But there is no shame in getting fanned by Britton; it happens to even the best.Remember worrying about Hyun Soo Kim?\xc2\xa0 He has been on an 8-for-17 streak. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.Add Caleb Joseph to the list of those who also seem to be getting their stroke and timing put together. Maybe Pedro Alvarez is as well. His slam was a monster shot for sure.Speaking of Alvarez, the best quote of the day referenced him, and it came from Buck Showalter in speaking about Pedro getting a hit in his first spring game, but then subsequently struggling \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s doing fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s like golf when you haven\xe2\x80\x99t played in seven or eight months.

He certainly did not seem at all like a beginner. His commentary was insightful, filled not only with timely remarks that came from a person with recent experience as a player, but it was also laced with research and statistical analysis about varied players.Looking at Twitter, I would guess that he was receiving about 80% positive remarks by fans. There were a few who continue to hold onto the Yankees resentment \xe2\x80\xa6 geez, let it go. And a few were pining for Jim Palmer. Hey, Palmer is great and is inimitable. Bordick is OK, but honestly, Roberts was better in my humble opinion. I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping he\xe2\x80\x99ll be a regular voice on the broadcasts. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"
03/22/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: What to Make of the 2016 Birds', 'With the Baltimore Orioles spring training season of 2016 headed toward the homestretch, what are we to think and feel about this version of the Birds?Here on The Baltimore Wire, we are a part of the FanSided Sports Network. We write from the perspective of the fan of a team, without apology. We are like you who read, passionate about our Birds. Our goal is not to be the blandly objective and dispassionate outside party looking in and just reporting about what goes on. No, we are invested in the team, yet not to the extent that we gloss over everything that goes awry, like a grandfather who sees no wrong in his grandkids. We want to speak the truth, good or bad.Honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99m finding some personal difficulty in getting as excited about this team and the coming season as I have been in recent years. And I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand that, even while I write this piece as a sort of catharsis.It may be simply because of the terribly unpredictable nature of this particular roster and squad. I can visualize the 2016 Orioles as anywhere between World Series Champions and losers who sink the team back to pre-2012 levels of despair.Those who like big-time home run power and money spent on big-name players to drive the ball out of the relatively small confines of OPACY are going to look forward to this season. But those who buy the philosophy that it is ALL about the starting pitching and that EVERYTHING rises and falls on that component will be disquieted about the coming campaign.I have written extensively on several occasions of my distance from the latter view. Again, if a team has a powerful rotation, that team is very likely to have a great season. But there are other ways to win in the modern game of baseball, as several franchises have illustrated in recent years.At the same time, I understand that the best power-hitting lineup in the world is not going to guarantee a successful season. The baseball adage that \xe2\x80\x9cgood pitching stops good hitting\xe2\x80\x9d is an adage mostly because it is so often the truth. There are going to be more than a few games this season where a good day by an opposing starter is going to have one Oriole after another doing the walk of shame back to the dugout without touching the baseball. That is going to be difficult to watch.But it is exciting to anticipate the displays of power outbreaks that surely will characterize this coming season. The back end of the bullpen is, as well, my favorite part of the team and the saving grace, in my humble opinion. Beyond this, the high-ranking defense is a quiet strength, especially evident when the O\xe2\x80\x99s play a team that has not made this a systemic value.So what remains as big worries? There is the issue of not sufficiently addressing the on base percentage need. This is becoming the big thing for winning teams in the same way that power rotations used to be. High OBP players not only get on base well, they also drive up pitch counts in an inning, weakening the pitcher and affording power hitters a higher percentage opportunity of getting a mistake that can be driven \xe2\x80\xa6 far.And then there is the elephant in the roster, the starting rotation. And I think I\xe2\x80\x99m getting to the core of why I am so \xe2\x80\x9ctrepidatious\xe2\x80\x9d (just made up that word) about the coming season. I have not faulted Duquette and the Orioles for not spending more money to get top-line starters. The top two aren\xe2\x80\x99t worth the incredible dollars they got, nor honestly were any of the others \xe2\x80\xa6 probably including Yovani Gallardo. The best move would have been to retain Wei-Yin Chen, though he seemed less interested in the Orioles than the other way around.So while I don\xe2\x80\x99t fault the lack of additions, wanting to see if upcoming pitchers like Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson can fill the holes, I have to admit that there is not a lot to give a fan any certainty or confidence here at the end of March. Not when you hear of Kevin Gausman getting cortisone injections, and not when you see the dreadful numbers from presumptive starters this spring.

So why can they not be hoped to have it in the present, if healthy?\xc2\xa0 Maybe not all five of them, but why not three of them, with one or two new arms to fill out the rest of the rotation?I guess I am afraid that the loudest, screaming critics could be proven to be correct. The fear is that the rotation will screw up what would otherwise be a playoffs team. Even as in 2015 the loudest critics were largely proven correct that the Orioles shot themselves in the foot by not bolting to re-sign Nelson Cruz and Nick Markakis. The revolving doors of corner outfielders was painful to see last year, and a similar scenario for starting pitchers could ruin the 2016 season.More than anything, I think my fears are that the national writers could be proven correct in their annual assessment that the Orioles have no chance of finishing above the basement of the AL East. Forget that these prognosticators have a current losing streak about O\xe2\x80\x99s predictions. I just want them to drown and choke to death in a sea of their own spilled ink cesspool, nothing more, nothing less.And that is because, at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day, with objectivity still in mind, I am ultimately a fan of the Baltimore Orioles. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles injury updates: Bad news for Kevin Gausman and ...', ' In a development that will be a surprise to everyone who\'s never followed baseball before, the Orioles have a number of players whose injury situations have now been revealed to be more serious than initially reported. The most concerning of these involves Kevin Gausman, who\xc2\xa0received a cortisone injection in his shoulder on Sunday.    At the time, the usual encouraging sounding quotes came from manager Buck Showalter, who said of the injection, ""I don\'t know if it\'s a big concern,"" and also, ""he\'ll be down for about three days before we pick back up again."" Two days later, the line has suddenly changed. Now the question is instead whether or not Gausman will be ready in time to make a start during the first turn through the rotation. He may\xc2\xa0have to go on the disabled list. This is not actually a surprise. This is the nature of things. Some small-sounding thing happens and sometimes it turns out to be much more serious, much like how the ""routine spring soreness"" of Matt Wieters has had him out of games for ten days and counting. The injury update on Wieters today is that he\xc2\xa0threw up to 90 feet on flat ground today. There was no indication of where this leaves him with regards to avoiding the DL for Opening Day. Gausman is not the only one who\'s gotten a cortisone injection. Brian Matusz received one on Sunday as well after pitching the last inning of Sunday\'s tie against the Rays. Matusz is now said to be ""in doubt"" for Opening Day, which, much like the situation with Gausman, will throw wide open a spot on the team that seemed to have been locked down.    Another player who looks to be having problems is Jimmy Paredes, who reportedly took some dry swings today and\xc2\xa0continued to have wrist soreness, so he\'s getting shut down and will probably open the season on the disabled list. The earliest date that can be used to put a player on the disabled list is March 25. If Gausman sticks to the current injury timetable - hoping to be back in the first or second week of the season - this could prove significant because it means the 15 day minimum DL stay doesn\'t have to take up 15 days of the regular season. A player put on the DL on March 25 would be eligible to come off of the DL on April 11. That\'s only a week into the season, but it\'s long enough that there would need to be a replacement for Gausman the first turn through the rotation. The O\'s will need their fifth starter in their sixth game, which is on April 10.

Right shoulder tendinitis is the name, and a cortisone injection appears to be the game. The Orioles said that Gausman will miss his next outing, which at this point also calls into question his availability to break camp with the team.Publicly at least, manager\xc2\xa0Buck Showalter does appear to be overly concerned (quote courtesy of Roch Kubatko, MASNsports):When we have some time here, try and clear it up before we break camp. Hopefully, that\xe2\x80\x99s all it is. See where we are in two or three days. He won\xe2\x80\x99t pick up a ball for two or three days.The questions obviously is whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s just a stall tactic on the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 part, or if in fact it\xe2\x80\x99s true. Tendonitis is something that will in fact clear up with proper treatment and concentrated rest. Furthermore it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for players to be feeling just a bit of discomfort at this point in the spring. However for a player who\xe2\x80\x99s never been shot with cortisone previously, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to say the least.\xc2\xa0Live Feed kevin gausmanBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red Sox Call to the PenKevin Gausman ejected vs. Red Sox after hitting Xander Bogaerts (Video) FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck Showalter The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman is trying to get back on track The Baltimore WireThe Orioles have to at the very least be thinking of some sort of contingency plan,Courtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsif Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s unable to break camp with them at the end of next week. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not even suggesting that physically he won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to go. It\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible that he might need to simply remain back and head to extended spring training to begin the season.Depending on the timeline, it might not even be much of a decision to make. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said previously, the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t need a fifth starter until week two when they find themselves in Boston. So if Gausman just needs a couple of extra days of work, they could easily just leave him in Sarasota and carry only four starting pitchers north at first.But the Birds also want to ensure that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that will linger. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re being so careful with this for the time being.

Well before, in fact. The O\xe2\x80\x99s became the first US team to play in Cuba in approximately 40 years back in March of 1999. They traveled to Havana and played a team of Cuban all-stars, who returned the visit in May when the teams met again at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.However yesterday it was the Tampa Rays playing the Cuban National team at the same ballpark in Havana. The game of course coincided with President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the island nation, the first such visit by anAmerican President in 88 years. Calvin Coolidge (\xe2\x80\x9cSilent Cal\xe2\x80\x9d) was the last President to set foot on Cuban soil. The entire first half of this week has been incredibly historic, whether you agree with President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s embrace of Cuba or not. Live Feed barack obamaTrumpcare, NAFTA, and ...

FanSidedMy parents\xe2\x80\x99 generation of course almost saw the world end over Cuba in 1962, and my generation grew up knowing Cuba as a foe (on par with the USSR). So to people of a certain age (myself included), seeing our President taking in a baseball game with Raul Castro in Havana is something we thought impossible at one time. But now that \xe2\x80\x9cdream\xe2\x80\x9d so to speak is reality.Sports has long played a role in dialogue when needed. The Olympics themselves were supposed to be a way that the world could unite under the banner of sport. And for the most part that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly how it goes. However there might not be two other nations on earth who could in theory be bound so closely together as the US and Cuba are by the love of baseball.There were times I suspect when the discussion between the Presidents was fairly heated. Castro seemed to embrace the view long held by his brother, Fidel, that most if not all of Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s problems were due to America\xe2\x80\x99s embargo. While President Obama seems to be willing to end the embargo, it would take an act of Congress to do so. On the flip side, President Obama was very forceful in delivering a message long-held throughout the free world: Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s continued human rights abuses always have been, and always will be unacceptable.

The Castro brothers are legendary baseball fans, and Fidel Castro even played at a semi-pro level at one time. Our two nations share a passion for the game, and it\xe2\x80\x99s through commonalities that we find agreements in this world. We all know President Obama as mainly a basketball fan, however his support of the Chicago White Sox is also fairly well-known. Overall, he\xe2\x80\x99s a sports guy just like most of us\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and I suspect that when the two sat together at the game yesterday, Raul Castro noticed our President\xe2\x80\x99s love of his favorite sport also. Baseball will always be America\xe2\x80\x99s pastime, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a pastime that belongs to Cuba. And sometimes simple gestures such as sitting with someone at a baseball game can open or move along dialogue. That\xe2\x80\x99s always been true in international relations. Next: Baltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's shoulder issueFor the record, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that Tampa won the game. I don\xe2\x80\x99t usually pick sides in games because it causes a conflict of interest. However when it\xe2\x80\x99s an American team against a team from another country, that\xe2\x80\x99s a different story! However the real winners here are future generations of Americans and Cubans.

While Wilson only pitched three innings, one has to wonder if the coaches aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking for a potential fifth starter to take north.

If so, perhaps you can look at this game as having foreshadowed that.Wilson was greeted rudely when he gave up a solo homer to Pittsburgh\xe2\x80\x99s Joyce in the first inning. That said, keep in mind that Joyce haunted the Orioles for years when he played in Tampa. Whatever Oriole pitching seemed to throw out there, he\xe2\x80\x99d hit. However the good news for the Birds was that they\xe2\x80\x99d eventually get the bats going later in the game.

Incidentally, the Birds would add a fifth run in the last of the seventh on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s first homer of the season. Pittsburgh would net an RBI-single and an RBI-triple in the eighth to tie the game at five.However all was not lost \xe2\x80\x93 if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at wins and losses, that is. After the Orioles announced that there would be no tenth inning, they put two runners into scoring position. That brought Chris Rickart, the Rule 5 pick aiming to make the team, to the plate as a pinch-hitter.

In January, the team signed Chris Davis to a seven-year, $162 million deal to be their starting first baseman for the foreseeable future. It feels like something here has to change.    Christian Walker Christian Walker will be 25 years old next week and has been a name to know for a while now. He is a product of the University of South Carolina, was a fourth-round pick in the 2012 draft and quickly worked his way through Aberdeen, Delmarva, Frederick and Bowie. Following the 2014 season, Baseball America rated Walker as the third-best prospect in the Orioles system behind the big two of Dylan Bundy and Hunter Harvey. The former Gamecock's performance has begun to plateau at Triple-A Norfolk. Over 182 games with the Tides he is slashing .257/.327/.424 with 24 home runs and 94 RBI. Those are not awful numbers, but it won't beat out Davis' production. This spring, Walker has shown impressive power, leading the O's in home runs (4) and slugging (.718) amongst those that have had more than a handful of at-bats. He has done so while maintaining the type of batting average (.256) we saw him with in Norfolk. However, it has been to the detriment of his on-base percentage (.273).    Trey Mancini Trey Mancini just turned 24 last week and seems to be the prospect-to-watch as of late. There was little fanfare for him as an eighth round pick from Notre Dame in 2013, but he caught eyes by winning the Eastern League batting title for the Baysox last summer, slashing .359/.395/.586 with 13 home runs and 57 RBI over 84 games. Yeah, that will work.    His numbers have just continued to get better as he moves through the system. His only hiccup happened during his first trip through Frederick in 2014, but he bounced back to start last summer with the Keys prior to moving onto Bowie. However, as we learned with Luis Montanez, winning a minor league batting title doesn't mean you are guaranteed major league success.\xc2\xa0ESPN's Keith Law doesn't seem impressed by Mancini, saying that his swing is long and he chases too many balls.    Mancini was invited to camp with the O's this spring. He struggled in his limited game time down in Florida, going 1-for-12 and has since been re-assigned to minor league camp. One would assume he starts the season in Norfolk as he has little to prove at any lower levels. Playing time...and location That is where the problem comes in with all of this. Where will Walker and Mancini be playing? Both have proved they are better than double-A, but neither have shown they are exactly ready for the bigs. Walker is closer but how does he fit on the roster? The team has Davis, Mark Trumbo and Pedro Alvarez (help!) who can technically play first base. Three bench spots are likely to go to Joey Rickard, Caleb Joseph and Ryan Flaherty. The competition could come down to Walker vs. Nolan Reimold, who has had an awful spring, for the final spot. But Reimold can play outfield, a weaker position for the O's than first.    The reporters have told us that Walker is working in with the corner outfielders, but that has turned into just six innings of left field during the actual games. Shouldn't he really be out there all the time if the O's plan on him actually making an impact at the big league level? Baseball America likes Walker's glove. They called him the best defensive first baseman of the Eastern League in 2014. Fangraphs has him as above average with the leather and just an average runner. Would just above average skills translate to an outfield spot? His batting numbers would certainly look nice out there compared to what the O's had in 2015. Mancini seems more cemented into first base. While not regarded as a bad fielder, he hasn't received any accolades for his glove-work. Scouts seem to think he has less power potential than Walker. Yet, all of his time this spring has been spent at first base, so the Orioles are holding out hope. What should the Orioles do? Walker has already been up to Baltimore for a cup of coffee and will likely be the first of the duo to return. But his bat looks as though it may be a finished product at this point and it would profile much better in left field than at first base. If Walker can prove that he is athletic enough for the position, he could be a fringe starter in the MLB as soon as this season. Maybe with the Orioles, maybe with someone else who may have a starting pitcher to part with. Start him down in Norfolk and play him everyday to get used to the position.    Mancini should remain at first base. As far as I can tell, that is the only position he is really familiar with. And he was so good last year that there is no reason to move him away. No matter what scouts say, if he can come close to repeating what he did a season ago, his prospect status will go through the roof. If the O's like Mancini enough, he too should move to the outfield in the future and see how it goes. Davis blocks him at first and if he is breaking down the door to Baltimore you have to find someway to get him involved. Who knows what will happen? Probably nothing. Left field is free for the taking still and the right field will be back on the market this winter. If somehow these two farmhands could take over than would be a huge boost to the Orioles organization. Thanks for reading! What do you think will happen with Mancini and Walker? Are their futures with the Orioles? If so, in what positions? If not, where are they headed? Let us know in the comments as well as on Twitter and Facebook!

03/25/2016,"[('Orioles asked Padres about James Shields - Camden Chat', ' At some unknown point, the Orioles search for pitching led them to talk to the San Diego Padres about possibly acquiring starter James Shields. That\'s according to\xc2\xa0MLB Network\'s Jon Heyman, who adds that ""several"" teams have talked about Padres, but nothing appears to be close to happening.    This is one of those rumors where the timing will determine how interesting it is. If they had this discussion yesterday, that\'s more interesting than if the O\'s had the discussion last month, before they signed Yovani Gallardo. The Orioles did get a pitcher from the Padres over the winter when they picked up Odrisamer Despaigne for minor leaguer Jean Cosme. It\'s also possible they talked about Shields at that time, realized there was no match, and the two teams made a different trade instead. So if this is relaying fruitless discussions from January, that\'s also less interesting than if they asked yesterday. Shields, now 34, is due a guaranteed $65 million over the next three seasons. That\'s $21 million per season for the next three seasons plus a $2 million buyout on a club option for the 2019 season. He also has a dreaded opt-out in his contract following this season. He would have to be very confident in himself or the market to opt out of $44 million guaranteed to him heading into his age 35 season.    It was a strange 2015 season for Shields, who struck out batters at a higher rate than ever, but also doubled his walk rate compared to what he did in 2014 with the Royals - going from 4.7% to 9.4%. And despite pitching with Petco Park as a home stadium, Shields gave up more home runs than ever. That led to a 3.91 ERA, the highest for Shields since 2010, and his fewest innings pitched since his rookie season of 2006. That second tidbit is misleading, admittedly, as Shields still crossed the 200 inning mark, which he\'s done every full big league season of his career. It\'s a safe guess the best of Shields is in the past, but there might still be decent-to-good seasons left in him. Worth giving up whatever the Padres would want for him? That\'s the trick, isn\'t it?    The Orioles, as has been harped on before and will be harped on again, don\'t have much in the way to offer at all once you exclude players they won\'t or shouldn\'t trade.

Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY SportsIn what might be a preview of the 2016 Baltimore Orioles season, it took five home runs to squeak out a 10-inning victory over the Yankees.Usually when a team slugs five homers in a game, it is going to be a rather certain win. But not with the Orioles and their current pitching state of affairs.The Orioles enjoyed getting three home runs off Ivan Nova: the fifth of the spring for Mark Trumbo, the second in two days by J.J. Hardy\xc2\xa0(wind aided), and a sweet two-run blast by Caleb Joseph. Manny Machado hit a solo shot in the seventh inning to tie the game before the Yankees took the lead again immediately in the top of the eighth off Pedro Beato.But it was the O\xe2\x80\x99s fifth homer of the day by Nolan Reimold that tied the game and sent it into extra innings. And he would later drive in a run in the decisive bottom of the 10th comeback victory. So the reports of Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s death have been greatly exaggerated.I am looking forward (as I write this) to seeing the complete replay of the game. The ending was entertaining for sure. Watching it on MLB Gameday while at the office, it was frustrating, as the app was not working well at all (true to form for spring training).Since the game went into the 10th inning, the Orioles brought in Stefan Crichton to pitch. I am not going to lie and say that I knew who that was. I had to look it up, noting he was 23rd-round pick in 2013 who has never pitched above the A level. He immediately gave up a double and three singles, yielding two Yankees runs in the top of the 10th.But this is clearly a guy who knows how to pitch into good luck. The Orioles began the bottom of the 10th by getting two consecutive runners on throwing errors by the third baseman. After loading the bases, Reimold got one run back on a liner to center before Garabez Rosa walked it off with a two-run single up the middle. Rosa is now 6-for-8 in the spring; gotta love that!

Having now watched those innings (while writing this article), it is indeed true. The velocity was fine and the change looked pretty good. The umpire was not helpful at all.

""You\'ve got to find every little thing that you can use to your advantage to keep the hitters off balance.""TRAINER\'S ROOM:Red Sox: 3B Pablo Sandoval, who has been limited by a back injury, took ground balls in Fort Myers and swung from both sides of the plate.""The last two days have been a marked improvement for Panda,"" manager John Farrell said. ""How he checks out tomorrow gives us a better indication of when he gets back in a game.""C Christian Vazquez, who is recovering from Tommy John surgery, has had a good spring, but is unlikely to start the season in the major leagues, according to Farrell.""If it\'s not Opening Day, he\'s making strides and getting closer to that,"" Farrell said.Orioles: RHP Kevin Gausman (shoulder) will likely start the season on the disabled list. He\'s yet to throw since taking a cortisone shot last Sunday.""I don\'t want to miss three or four starts. I definitely want to be with the team early on in the season and be able to make 30-plus starts. My goal is to get there within the first two weeks of the season,"" Gausman said.C Matt Wieters threw to the bases for the first time since his right elbow flared up on March 12.UP NEXT:Red Sox: RHP Steven Wright pitches for Boston as it hosts the Philadelphia Phillies and RHP Jerad Eickhoff on Sunday.Orioles: RHP Ubaldo Jimenez starts for Baltimore as it travel to Bradenton to face Pittsburgh and RHP Trevor Williams on Sunday night.CUT: The Orioles optioned 1B/OF Christian Walker to Triple-A Norfolk so that he could play left field regularly.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

C. Sabathia.Nova, a right-hander, fell behind in counts and said he had lost control of his fastball. Three of the five hits he allowed to the Baltimore Orioles were home runs \xe2\x80\x94 he had not given up one in four previous starts \xe2\x80\x94 and all were headed over the wall at the crack of the bat.He gave up six runs (five earned), struck out five, issued two walks and was called for a balk. The only positives were that he did not hit a batter or throw a wild pitch in a game won by the Orioles, 11-10, in 10 innings.With nine days remaining until opening day, Nova could not have scripted a worse time for a sloppy start.

03/27/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Crazy Baseball Season Straight Ahead', 'Mar 15, 2016; Dunedin, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles second baseman Ryan Flaherty (3) is congratulated by teammates as he scores during the first inning against the Toronto Blue Jays at Florida Auto Exchange Park. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsSpring training for the Baltimore Orioles has set up an expectation for local fans that 2016 is going to be a crazy and wild season.It has affirmed the anticipation that this is indeed going to be a powerful lineup, particularly for the long ball. Even with many of the top power hitters in the lineup having fewer repetitions at the plate as compared to the regular season, the Orioles have hit 36 homers in 28 games. Only two teams have more this spring.At the same time, spring training has also more than slightly triggered the greatest concerns of Orioles fans. The starting pitching in particular has been even worse than feared. The numbers are simply ghastly. The team ERA of 6.49 is by far the worst in all of baseball, and a WHIP for the pitching staff of 1.77 in nearly unimaginable.The pitching cannot possibly be this bad for the regular season, can it? Well, no, not really. Actually, the spring season in all of baseball has higher numbers for offense and worse pitching stats than in the regular season. There are only five teams in MLB that currently have a team ERA under 4.0, with the best being the Rays at 3.31 and the Nationals at 3.32.But even with all of the runs that the Orioles have been scoring in recent days, their team batting average of .260 ranks 26th in MLB spring training, with the OBP of .322 (equal to the regular season average of all teams) as 25th in rank. It is interesting to see that the Yankees are dead last in both of these categories.In comments both to me and of those that I read online, I can see that Orioles fans are attempting to calibrate their hopes and expectations for the 2016 season. And most people find themselves dealing with a sort of fandom bipolar syndrome \xe2\x80\x94 of being excited about the lineup potential and the way Mark Trumbo and Joey Rickard look to add a lot of punch, while also fearing that the rotation might not be capable of any sort of bounce-back season whatsoever.Clearly there are going to be a lot of highs \xe2\x80\xa6 lots of home runs and high-scoring games. But there could be some terrible lows, multiple experiences of frustrations as in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game where the Orioles gave Gallardo an early three-run lead, only to see him give up five runs in the second inning.

A team with solid pitching that struggles to score?\xc2\xa0 Maybe some people like that. Maybe the true baseball purist likes a low-scoring game. Maybe that person is also a big soccer fan.Of course, I\xe2\x80\x99d most like a team that scores a lot of runs while routinely shutting down the opposition. Give me the top power-hitting lineup in the league and four 20-game winners!\xc2\xa0 OK, yes, that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened around Baltimore since I was a teenager, and I now have eight grandchildren. But honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather see a team with some offensive pop and pitchers that can be developed.But the reality is that there are going to be many days where the opposing pitcher really has some nasty stuff working. And while the O\xe2\x80\x99s hitters might run into a couple pitches, overall, those games are going to far more likely end up as losses for the good guys in orange and black.It simply looks like a wild and crazy season ahead. Really, we\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to somehow be able to predict where this team could finish? Anything is possible. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: 1960-1965, Laying the Foundation', '1960 began an era of winning for the Baltimore Orioles that laid the foundation for one of the most dominant generations in Baseball history. If the late 1950\xe2\x80\x99s were the Baltimore Oriole\xe2\x80\x99s initiation into the fraternity known as Major League Baseball, the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s marked the Oriole\xe2\x80\x99s ascension into greatness and the beginning of an almost dynasty like era that would last over 20 seasons.During the early 1960\xe2\x80\x99s General Manager Lee MacPhail masterfully laid the foundation for over two decades of success that would see the Orioles become a World Series contender almost every season. The scouting and player development displayed by the Orioles organization during the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s is legendary and set the tone for how the business of baseball was carried out in Baltimore that would become known as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Oriole Way\xe2\x80\x9d. Countless All Stars, League MVP\xe2\x80\x99s, Cy Young award winners, and future Hall of Famers came through the Orioles farm system or spent some of the most important years of their Major League careers in the Orange and Black. It was during the first half of the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s that Oriole fans became accustomed to winning and contending. The only thing eluding their team was a coveted World Championship and the winning ways of the early \xe2\x80\x9860\xe2\x80\x99s were foreshadowing for the better days to come.1960 Baltimore OriolesThe 1960 season marked the first winning season for the version of the Orioles that arrived from St. Louis in 1954. The team won 89 games, good enough for a distant second place finish in the American League, eight games behind the New York Yankees, who would go on to lose a heart breaking World Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates even as they severely outscored and outhit the Bucs. The breakthrough success of the Birds earned Paul Richards the Manager of the Year award.Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireDuring the fall of 1959 after the Orioles season ended, the team acquired First baseman Jim Gentile from the Dodgers and before the 1960 season began, they promoted Shortstop Ron Hansen and Starting Pitcher Chuck Estrada to the big league club. The moves paid off as all three young players made their first All Star teams and all three finished in the top two of Rookie of the Year voting. Hansen won the award and Estrada and Gentile tied for second place. Estrada led the league with 18 wins and was named The Sporting News Pitcher of the Year. It was the best season he\xe2\x80\x99d have in Major League Baseball and he\xe2\x80\x99d be out of the league by 1967 but he would be a solid performer during the first half of the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s for the Baltimore Orioles.Hansen would go on to play a much bigger role in the building of a Major League powerhouse when three years later he\xe2\x80\x99d be the jewel of a trade to the Chicago White Sox for a speedy Shortstop who would make it to Cooperstown.Two other notables from the 1960 season; Brooks Robinson made his first of 15 consecutive All Star games and Steve Barber debuted for the Orioles. He\xe2\x80\x99d later become the first 20 game winner for the Orioles.More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to consider1961 Baltimore OriolesOne of the most remarkable seasons in Baseball history, the Orioles won 95 games in 1961 but finished in 3rd Place, 14 games behind the eventual World Champion New York Yankees. Also finishing a distant 3rd was hard luck MVP candidate Jim Gentile who slugged 46 Home Runs, and led the league with 141 RBI. Unfortunately he chose the summer of the Yankee\xe2\x80\x99s M&M boy\xe2\x80\x99s chase of Babe Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s single season Home Run record to have his career year. Mickey Mantle would finish in 2nd with 54 Home Runs after an injury ended his season and Roger Maris would famously break the record with 61 Home Runs.Amid all of the excitement of the Home Run chase, some notables from the season for the Orioles included the Major League debut of John Wesley Powell, who we\xe2\x80\x99d soon know as Boog. At just 19 years old his bat was still developing prodigious power and his pit beef recipe was simmering. The Orioles starting Outfield also featured two future Hall of Fame Managers; Dick Williams and Whitey Herzog.1961 marked Paul Richard\xe2\x80\x99s last season as the Orioles Manager when he led the team to a 78-57 record before resigning in September to become the GM of the new Houston Colt .45\xe2\x80\x99s. Lum Harris managed the final 27 games, of which the O\xe2\x80\x99s won 17.Over in the National League, budding superstar Frank Robinson won his first MVP Award.1962 Baltimore OriolesIn 1962, the Orioles took a tumble in the standings, losing 85 games for a 7th Place finish. It was an all-around bad season for the Birds, the first for Manager Billy Hitchcock. The only bright spots being the move of Boog Powell into the starting Left Field position and the arrival of young pitcher Dave McNally who pitched in one game in 1962. All he\xe2\x80\x99d do is toss a Complete Game Shut Out for his first career Win.Meanwhile, Earl Weaver was promoted to Manager of the AA Elmira Pioneers, who won the Eastern League Championship that season with the rich talent that would don the Orange and Black in the coming years.1963 Baltimore OriolesIn 1963 the Orioles would return to their winning ways with an 86 win season and a 4th place finish. Just before the season the Orioles acquired a slick fielding speedster at Shortstop named Luis Aparicio in a multi-player deal headlined by the former Rookie of the Year, Hansen. Aparicio would be another piece of the historically defensive minded Oriole contenders of the late 1960\xe2\x80\x99s and he\xe2\x80\x99d lead the league in stolen bases with 40.The Orioles also acquired Closer Stu Miller in 1963 and he\xe2\x80\x99d go on to lead the league in appearances with 71 and Saves with 27.1964 Baltimore OriolesIn 1964, the Orioles would barely miss the post season, winning 97 games and finishing 3 games out of First Place behind the 99 win Yankees and the 98 win White Sox. But it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be long now\xe2\x80\xa6.things really started to fall into place for the Orioles in 1964 as they developed into a Championship caliber club.The Orioles replaced Hitchcock as Manager with former War Hero and Yankee Rightfielder Hank Bauer. The three time All Star was the recipient of 11 campaign ribbons in the WWII Pacific theatre. He was decorated with two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts after being one of only six Marines to survive from the Platoon he commanded as part of the 4th Raider Battalion during the Battle of Okinawa. After returning to the United States due to a shrapnel injury and joining the pipefitter\xe2\x80\x99s union, a chance meeting with a Yankee scout at a bar led to a tryout. 15 years later his resume also included seven World Series rings before embarking on a Managerial career.1964 also marked the Major League debut of Centerfielder Paul Blair, who before Adam Jones arrived was easily considered the greatest CF in Oriole history. Also notable were the MLB debut of Lou Piniella, a 19 Win season from teenager Wally Bunker, and Brooks Robinson being named the American League MVP behind a stat line of 35/118/.317 and his usual remarkable defense at Third base.1965 Baltimore OriolesWith a 94 Win season in 1965, winning was becoming expected in Baltimore and the hunger for a postseason appearance was boiling over. Lucky for Oriole fans, the final pieces of the Championship puzzle were arriving in the form of 1965 Rookie of the Year Curt Blefary, 19 year old Pitcher Jim Palmer, who pitched out of the bullpen to a 5-4 record and one save, and 22 year old infielders Davey Johnson and Mark Belanger. In addition, young Paul Blair took over the starting role in CF and at the top of the lineup. The O\xe2\x80\x99s seemed poised for greatness but they were still one player away\xe2\x80\xa6.Next: Baltimore Orioles: One Week to GoCheck back later to read about the Glory Years!

03/28/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles R&amp;R: Joey Rickard and Garabez Rosa', 'Mar 8, 2016; Sarasota, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles center fielder Joey Rickard (23) singles during the second inning against the Boston Red Sox at Ed Smith Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsWhile the rotation of the Baltimore Orioles continues to underperform and cause great concern, rookies Joey Rickard and Garabez Rosa have been a great spring training surprise.Again on Sunday it was a game where the Orioles jumped out to a first inning lead, with solo homers by Pedro Alvarez and Nolan Reimold, only to have the starting pitcher immediately give up the advantage. Ubaldo Jimenez did not make it out of the first inning after allowing three runs on four hits and a walk.The bullpen came in and shut down the Pirates the rest of the way, yielding only three hits in 8.1 innings. Perhaps this is the winning equation for the Orioles \xe2\x80\x94 forget starting pitchers and carry a dozen bullpen arms, using about six of them per game.But winning the game in the ninth inning, breaking the tie score, were back-to-back hits by Rickard and Rosa. Much has been written about the Rule 5 selection Joey Rickard, as he has been truly the star of the spring season for the Orioles. He is now hitting .396 on 21-for-53 with an OBP of .475.\xc2\xa0 That is more than a small sample and should be enough to get anyone on a 25-man roster..theiaPostSlider_nav._lower{display:none !important}Related Story: Joey Rickard is a KeeperBut what about this Garabez Rosa character?\xc2\xa0 Where has he come from?\xc2\xa0 Right now he is hitting .667 with eight hits in 12 at-bats. And he was 3-for-6 last spring. Apparently he is not intimidated by playing on the major league field.Rosa is age 26 and listed as 6\xe2\x80\x992\xe2\x80\x99 and 166 pounds. An infielder from the Dominican Republic, his career minor league numbers are not quite as impressive as his brief spring training appearances. In 899 games, he has a .259 average, never having played higher than the AA level at Bowie (other than four games last year at Norfolk). And he is not a high OBP player either, never having been over .300.\xc2\xa0 But he likes playing baseball in Florida in April.The Hyun Soo Kim SituationSwitching subjects, what is to become this week of Korean outfielder Hyun Soo Kim?\xc2\xa0 It certainly appears to be more than merely smoke that the Orioles have given consideration to an arrangement for him to return to Korea.

But since then he has been 8-for-19.It may prove to be the best situation to save the $7 million by working out a deal back in Korea. But my guess is that Kim would have eventually \xe2\x80\x94 maybe even quickly \xe2\x80\x94 figured out how to play successfully here in the USA.In what was surely an awkward interview process with the O\xe2\x80\x99s beat writers, Kim commented that he had no real knowledge of any ongoing discussions, commenting further that it has been a challenge to adjust to hitting pitchers he has not seen nor does he know what they really throw.Let me ask it this way: Why should we expect a player in Kim\xe2\x80\x99s position to have any significant measure of success in the early going? Not only is there the adjustment to the game in a different place, there are all of the other cultural differences to navigate. None of this is insurmountable at all, though putting it together immediately is expecting quite a lot, even of a talented athlete.This is not to say that I necessarily believe sending Kim back to Asia is a wrong move, thus counting on some combination of Rickard, Reimold, etc. to carry duties in left field. I am just stating the belief that it would have eventually worked out to have a decent MLB player in Hyun Soo Kim with the Orioles this year and next. And that may yet happen.\xc2\xa0Rickard certainly looks great and appears to be the real deal. His star is rising fast, that is for sure. The minor league numbers from last year are legit and give additional foundation to the validity of this spring season. Yet at the same time, MLB scouts are going to put a book together on him, and he will have to make adjustments. That will be the critical time that determines if he has a potentially bigger and long-term standing with the Orioles. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"
03/29/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Left Field Options Old and New', 'Mar 28, 2016; Fort Myers, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles left fielder Nolan Reimold (14) singles during the seventh inning against the Boston Red Sox at JetBlue Park. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThe only remaining positional battle for the Baltimore Orioles is in left field, where there are several current options and several rumored options possible.Indications would seem to be that Korean import Hyun Soo Kim is not favored. There was the terrible early adjustment, though that had seemed to be addressed by better results over the past 10-12 days. But there might well be more to the matter than meets the eye, at least from a distance. And the eye that counts most belongs to Buck Showalter. And perhaps he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the look in Kim\xe2\x80\x99s eye, there\xe2\x80\x99s always that.Young Rule 5 draftee Joey Rickard has been as good as anybody, but the issue remains that it is spring training and he\xe2\x80\x99s never played in a regular season game. How will this translate? I personally think he\xe2\x80\x99s the real deal, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen stars of the spring fade before Memorial Day in the past.Nolan Reimold remains a viable option, especially since he has gotten hot over the past handful of games. A player who is alternately loved or scorned by varied constituencies of the O\xe2\x80\x99s fanbase, he truly is fully healthy at this point and presents on-base skills beyond what most Oriole players bring to the team.

The Orioles could see Ryan Flaherty as a fifth outfielder (with Chris Davis available also) and keep Paul Janish as a utility infielder.But other conversation in the past 24 hours has included two possible additions from outside the organization: David Murphy and Matt Joyce. Murphy was released by the Red Sox, which begs the question for me as to why we would want him. But that aside, he bats left-handed, as does Joyce.Murphy is entering his age 35 year of play, Joyce age 31.\xc2\xa0 Both have had moderately successful careers, though with some ups and downs in various years. Murphy is a career .274 hitter, Joyce at .242, though with a career OBP of .335 which is remarkable for that batting average.Let\xe2\x80\x99s chart the two players, noting both their 2015 stats, and their number for the past three seasons \xe2\x80\xa6Name/YrABHRAVGOBPMurphy 201539110.283.318Joyce 20152475.174.272Murphy 13-15132931.253.305Joyce 13-15107832.228.324\xc2\xa0There is not a lot in those numbers to get terribly excited about. It would seem to me that Kim should be able to do the same if given the chance. And beyond that, there are other options in the organization without adding more names to the mix. The Orioles are also going to give Christian Walker a chance to learn the position.But Murphy was a first-round draft choice of the Red Sox, so don\xe2\x80\x99t be totally shocked if Dan Duquette wants to get him.

What is still unknown who leaked the contract details and ultimately put the Cubs back into the mix.<\\/p>\\n<p>We later learned that the Orioles essentially wanted Fowler to pay the cost for losing a first-round pick by signing him. While the team looks bad by doing so, that&#8217;s how the league rules are set up to negotiate with free agents.

There are teams out there who\'ve set their 25-man rosters already. The Orioles are not one of those teams, although I suspect they do know who will be on their roster by now. They just haven\'t made the moves they need to make to set it. We now know Miguel Gonzalez\xc2\xa0will not be on that roster at all. That news is a few hours old and I\'m still bummed about it.

Caleb Joseph C    SP - Chris Tillman RHP Though, I don\'t think there are any among us who\'d like to see #2 hitter Wieters in the regular season. As with his presence at that spot yesterday, I think it\'s probably about giving him a chance to get some at-bats by having him higher in the order. Wieters missed a lot of camp due to his ""routine spring soreness"" that knocked him out early on. The fact that Wieters is playing in this game at all gives us a good sign that he\'s going to be healthy for Opening Day, unless a setback crops up in the next few days. Being as this will be the final tune-up start for Opening Day starter Tillman, hopefully he can look good too. I won\'t be holding my breath.

03/31/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Baseball Business and Miguel Gonzalez', 'The Baltimore Orioles have decided to part ways with Miguel Gonzalez in a decision that is as much about the business of baseball as it is about the metrics of the sport.The complicated rules allow the O\xe2\x80\x99s to release Gonzalez without having to pay the bulk of his $5.1 million salary. Sending him to the minors would keep them on the hook for the dollars involved.Most readers of this column have probably by now read about the reasoning involved in terms of his drop off in performance over much of last year and this spring. Here on The Baltimore Wire just yesterday we pondered if Miguel had done enough to be kept in the rotation. Our essential opinion was that he probably had not done so, that his Tuesday start was not as good as a single run in five innings would appear, that his stuff was not crisp and under control, but that his track record and affection from the organization would keep him.But baseball business realities have intervened.Those realities are not popular in the clubhouse. No surprise there. He is a genuinely good guy and well-liked by everyone.This opens a spot for presumably Mike Wright and/or Tyler Wilson to join the rotation to start the season. Also here on The Baltimore Wire, we have in the past spoken against expensive starting pitching additions (including Gallardo) in reference to how filling vacancies constantly with new names creates a blocking pattern against developing players who have nothing more to prove at the AAA level. So whereas it is sad to see Gonzalez go, there is merit in the opening it provides. We anticipate this is going to be a net positive move for the team.But let\xe2\x80\x99s take a few paragraphs here to reflect on the past four seasons of Miguel Gonzalez and the Baltimore Orioles. O\xe2\x80\x99s fan should rightly be grateful for the time and talents of this quiet and unassuming pitcher. He should be fondly remembered in Baltimore.The story of Gonzalez is a great one. Seemingly washed out of MLB opportunity and pitching in Mexico, he was discovered and made an unlikely ascent to the Orioles in the middle of 2012. Those of us who follow these transactions closely were skeptical that this fellow with an unimpressive background could become any sort of significant contributory piece. But he did.

He was a bargain.Consider what he has accomplished for the Birds. He was 39-33 in 95 starts with a 3.82 ERA. He had a 2.09 ERA in the 39 games where he was the winning pitcher. The Orioles were 52-43 in games where he was the starting pitcher. These are very good numbers.Here is the issue with Gonzalez: He has less physical skills and talent than the vast majority of major league pitchers. He is only 6-1, 170 pounds. He does not have great velocity (especially this spring) nor incredible ball movement and put-away secondary pitches. To be successful, he had to labor consistently on the very edge of personal perfection \xe2\x80\xa6 there was little room for error.But here is the further issue with Gonzalez: He walked the fine line over and over. He lived on the corners and made pitches most often when he needed to. He was truly a pitcher, not a thrower. Gonzalez should be warmly remembered and highly respected for this. In an era when pampered professional athletes are great, often because they are a God-gifted freak of nature in terms of physical abilities, Gonzalez was a mortal who the rest of us could appreciate as a workman we can relate to.Another great attribute that he did have in spades was the perfect personality for a pitcher \xe2\x80\x94 the emotional flat line. One could never tell when it was going well or going poorly. He competed with pitch after pitch, regardless of the highs or lows surrounding him.And finally let me finish this with a more personal reflection. You may recall that Miguel was originally with the Angels organization. He was there with a local Western Maryland product, Nick Adenhart \xe2\x80\x94 whom you might also recall was tragically killed in a car crash in April, 2009 after making his first rotation start as rookie. Nicky was from my high school where I coached \xe2\x80\x94 Williamsport. He was a friend and fellow graduate with my son.Miguel Gonzalez and Nick Adenhart were also friends. And when Miguel made his first start for the Orioles, he did so with a baseball glove that Nick had given to him \xe2\x80\x94 honoring his departed friend, even as he had realized his own dream of making it to the big leagues. Classy guy.Yep, Miguel Gonzalez is a good guy. It was great to have had him with the Orioles. We should wish him well, as hopefully he can pick up elsewhere, even if he has to re-invent himself as a long reliever or something like that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t count him out. People did that before, and they were wrong. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Hyun Soo Kim officially refuses demotion to the Orioles ...', ' It just wouldn\'t be the Orioles if there wasn\'t one more weird twist to come before the regular season gets underway. On Thursday afternoon, Fox Sports\' Ken Rosenthal threw another log on the strange fire of the O\'s offseason with a report that Hyun Soo Kim is resisting a minor league demotion.    Thursday night, or Friday morning in Korea, Kim\'s agency confirmed that Kim\xc2\xa0will not accept any demotion. This was in the contract: If they wanted to send him down, he would have to agree. Now, the O\'s will either have to keep Kim on the roster despite his spring training struggles, hoping he\'ll figure it out in time, or just release him and pay him the $7 million that he is contracted to make over the next two years. What makes this such a surprise reversal is that two days ago it was Rosenthal who reported that Kim\xc2\xa0was believed to be willing to accept a demotion. Of course, it\'s always possible that Kim changed his mind between now and then, but it\'s also possible that whoever Rosenthal talked to a couple of days ago had no idea what he or she was talking about. Orioles beat writer Rich Dubroff for CSN Baltimore added:     Buck Showalter met a third time with Hyun Soo Kim today and there were no signs that situation was closer to solution. #Orioles\r \xe2\x80\x94 Rich Dubroff (@RichDubroffCSN) March 31, 2016        Which kind of makes it sound like whoever talked to Rosenthal a couple of days ago had no idea what he or she was talking about. Maybe it was the same person who was certain that the Orioles had reached an agreement with Dexter Fowler. It\'s not really hard to understand Kim\'s perspective here. He didn\'t come over to the United States to slum in Norfolk when he\'s been a professional for ten seasons in Korea. Major leagues or bust.    Unfortunately, it\'s been such a bad spring for him, with no signs of hope, that it\'s really put the O\'s in a bind as far as what to do. They would surely prefer not to just eat the $7 million. But they would also prefer not to have a guy on the roster who maybe needs more playing time to adjust to the level of competition, only when they have pretensions about competing they can\'t really have that guy working it out in the starting lineup. MASN\'s Roch Kubatko wrote that the O\'s ""want Kim to understand they aren\'t having buyer\'s remorse."" Another topic that may have come up in the most recent meeting is that the Orioles are always making roster changes and that they will not use only 25 players over the course of the season. It seems that so far this hasn\'t proved to be convincing. About the whole situation, O\'s GM-type Dan Duquette told O\'s reporters:     The Orioles are happy Kim is on board, but we feel the player needs more at-bats to prepare for the season, which unfortunately we don\'t have now in Baltimore and it\'s the reason the club requested that the player consider an optional assignment. We recognize player rights and are glad to have him in the organization. We all look forward to his contributions to the club after he\'s had more time to adjust to his new surroundings.\xc2\xa0All the club is asking him to do is take more time. We\'re glad to have him in the organization. The organization is fine with him.  Duquette also noted that in Korea, players have ten weeks to prepare for a season, while MLB spring training lasts for only half of that time. If the O\'s decide to keep Kim rather than release him, that probably means he\'ll squeeze out an existing bench player - maybe Nolan Reimold. Poor Nolan. He never can catch a break. The best case scenario would be if the O\'s could come to some kind of understanding with Kim over the minor league demotion. We don\'t seem to be heading towards that scenario unless something changes over the next couple of days. The deadline to set the Opening Day roster is Sunday at noon, so the Orioles have between now and then to decide how they want to proceed.    This article has been updated to reflect that it\'s now official that Kim will refuse the minor league assignment.

But some of these players from the Asian Leagues are unpredictable. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that in a bad way. I get the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re needing to assimilate in our culture as well as in the major leagues. So we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised when they struggle in a sense. But the Orioles now find themselves in a pickle.And not just in one manner, incidentally. If they decide to relent and put Kim on the roster, they\xe2\x80\x99ll do so knowing that they\xe2\x80\x99re carrying a guy that knows he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted off the bat. Furthermore, from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 perspective Kim is also holding them up in a sense by not rendering a decision. In effect, he\xe2\x80\x99s leaving the roster in limbo \xe2\x80\x93 which is within his right, I might add.

If you give a player that type of leverage, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to use it to his advantage.However there\xe2\x80\x99s also no question that based on Kim\xe2\x80\x99s spring performances, he\xe2\x80\x99s not ready to be a big leaguer. So given that clause in his contract, the absolute worst-case scenario from the organization\xe2\x80\x99s perspective has come true. Again, hopefully that\xe2\x80\x99s something of which the Orioles and other teams take note. That is if Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s Law means anything.\xc2\xa0Live Feed hyun-soo kimOrioles' Late-Inning Magic a Sign of a Contender The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Corner Outfield Production in 2016 The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Subs Getting the Job Done The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball Week 10: Top 5 Waiver Wire Adds Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksA Look at the Baltimore Orioles' Outfield Options The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Hyun Soo Kim on Day One The Baltimore WireI would expect this to somehow balloon into some sort of national story that paints the O\xe2\x80\x99s in a bad light \xe2\x80\x93 similar to the Fowler, Gallardo, and Balfour situations. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about the error of giving Kim that type of leverage. That\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s well worth criticizing the organization over \xe2\x80\x93 heck, I did it myself in this article.Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsI\xe2\x80\x99m talking more on the level of personnel management. At some point it\xe2\x80\x99ll turn into the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s the Orioles keeping Kim flailing in the wind. Nevermind the fact that it took Kim the better part of a week to decide to enforce his contract. (And for the record I support his decision because I would have done the same thing \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s just that for me it would have been a no-brainer\xe2\x80\xa6I either get to play in the big leagues, or I get a free $7 million.) But again, I digress\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to lie, if I were the Orioles I\xe2\x80\x99d seriously consider just paying the man his money and accepting my losses. I would tend to agree with Dan Duquette in that Kim just needs some time to work some things out. And the minors are a great place to do that \xe2\x80\x93 at this point it would be an extension of spring training. In terms of his maturation as a player and his adjustment to life in the United States, the minors make the most sense.And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I say they should just cut their losses and eat the money. In general I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a very bad idea \xe2\x80\x93 cutting someone and having to pay them. But the O\xe2\x80\x99s are already carrying a Rule 5 pick that has to be on the roster without fail. They can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to carry another player who they literally have no choice but to keep. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough enough to carry one guy like that \xe2\x80\x93 two makes it near impossible.And part of that stems from the fact that Kim doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem willing to engage in something that would improve him as a baseball player. Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s his right as per the deal he signed \xe2\x80\x93 so I can\xe2\x80\x99t totally blame him there. But it would stand to reason that if he wants to make it in Major League Baseball he\xe2\x80\x99d consider waiving that right so as to go through a process that\xe2\x80\x99s going to help him to improve.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerOf course, there is another way. There\xe2\x80\x99s always a chance that Kim will wake up with a sore hamstring, or perhaps an injured intercoastal muscle. I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that sending a healthy player to the DL with an invented or exaggerated injury is the most honest of methods. But teams do it all the time \xe2\x80\x93 and nobody probably does it better than the Orioles. It\xe2\x80\x99s all but a part of the game.Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s always a chance that Kim might come out and say that he\xe2\x80\x99s fine and he\xe2\x80\x99s unsure why he\xe2\x80\x99s going to the DL. That happened to the O\xe2\x80\x99s a year or two ago if you recall.\xc2\xa0However that aside while it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily as on the level as folks would like to think this world should be, it would give Kim 15 extra days to work things out in Sarasota. Then the Orioles would have another 30 days in which they could send him to the minors on a rehab assignment. That time very well might do the trick. In terms of the player getting his way along with the team, it would basically be a compromise. Would it look suspicious? It would for sure. But unless Kim himself says that something is up, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see any other team raising a stink about it. Basically, ensure that all is well in your camp before you start pointing fingers. "", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles set 25-man roster - well, mostly - Camden Chat', "" The Orioles cleared out the remaining fodder from their spring training roster with a flurry of moves following the conclusion of their final spring tune-up game on Friday night. When the dust settled, the Orioles were down to 28 players plus one non-roster invitee still with the team, with a Sunday deadline to get the rest of the way to 25.    There were five non-roster players re-assigned to minor league camp: Pitchers Pedro Beato and Todd Redmond; infielders Paul Janish and Steve Tolleson; and outfielder L.J. Hoes. The Orioles also passed pitchers Zach Phillips and Chaz Roe through waivers, outrighting them to Triple-A Norfolk. Those players are now off the 40-man roster. Finally, catcher Francisco\xc2\xa0Pe\xc3\xb1a was optioned to Norfolk.    That leaves one lone non-roster invitee still hanging around. The last one is outfielder Xavier Avery, who hasn't been in the majors since his stint with the 2012 O's. The 26-year-old had himself a good spring, however meaningful that may be to you.    Before Friday's game, Avery was batting .276/.432/.621 for spring - though Avery, it should be noted, faced\xc2\xa0slightly less than Double-A caliber competition while compiling his spring numbers. That's almost a full level weaker than any other Oriole faced in spring. Presumably, Avery hasn't been reassigned yet because the O's are either holding out hope that Hyun Soo Kim will accept a minor league assignment, or they are considering releasing him after all, even though there was a report earlier Friday that\xc2\xa0they were going to keep Kim.    Avery is likely a more ideal reserve outfielder than Kim, but who knows. If they keep Kim and still really want Avery, that would probably mean they'd choose Avery's greater potential versatility over Nolan Reimold, who can never seem to catch a break. The three players who will be headed to the disabled list for at least some time are Kevin Gausman, Brian Matusz, and Jimmy Paredes. Then they'll either make room for Avery somehow or they won't. So that's that for now, until something changes later.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Bob Haynie: Starting Pitching Will Make Or Break The Orioles', ' The Baltimore Orioles have won more games (355) than any team in the American League East since 2012. Their streak of four-straight non-losing seasons is the franchise\xe2\x80\x99s longest since the Birds had winning records every year from 1968-1985. If the Orioles are going to have any chance of continuing this run of success and being a contender in the American League, the starting pitching will have to be better than it was in 2015. Baltimore starters posted a 4.53 ERA last season which ranked 14th in the AL. A similar performance will doom the season. The Orioles are going to be a very powerful team when it comes to hitting home runs. 1B Chris Davis, CF Adam Jones and 3B Manny Machado are all capable of blasting away. Added to mix this off-season were OF/DH Mark Trumbo and IF/DH Pedro Alvarez, who have had big HR years themselves. SS J.J. Hardy is healthy for the first time in a while and 2B Jonathan Schoop could have a breakout campaign. Throw in catchers Matt Wieters and Caleb Joseph, and the Birds look like a club that could set the single-season record for long balls. The Orioles are strong defensively in the infield and up the middle. Trumbo will start in RF were he possesses a strong throwing arm and Rule 5 pick Joey Rickard is considered to be a plus defender in LF. Manager Buck Showalter can rely on LHP Zach Britton being one of the top closers in baseball as he anchors the bullpen. 2016 will be the year in which we finally get to see top pitching prospect Dylan Bundy in action. Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s addition brings another power arm to the staff. For the Orioles, it will all come down to the rotation. 2015\xe2\x80\x99s most reliable starter was LHP Wei-Yin Chen, who left via free-agency for the Miami Marlins. He was replaced by RHP Yovani Gallardo, who helped pitch the Texas Rangers into the playoffs last season. Gallardo had a good first half of 2015 (2.62 ERA) but had a rough second half (4.69 ERA). He has been reliable for most of his career and Baltimore hopes he can continue to be a 200 IP guy. RHP Chris Tillman hopes to bounce back from rough year and RHP Kevin Gausman will attempt to live up to the hype once he returns from the DL in late April. RHP Ublado Jimenez, like Gallardo, was good in the first half last season (2.81 ERA) and bad in the second half (5.63 ERA). Right-handers Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson are going to get their shot now that RHP Miguel Gonzalez has been released. The Orioles are going to hit, field and pitch well out of the bullpen. If they get consistent starting pitching, they will challenge for the division title. If the starting pitching is poor, that last place finish that most experts are predicting for them could become a reality.  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com')]"
04/02/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Starting Pitching Projections', ""As opening day approaches, here are my statistic pitching projections for the Orioles starting rotationOpening day is almost here, and to follow up with my\xc2\xa0starting lineup projections, I\xe2\x80\x99ve put together a series of statistical projections for the starting rotation of the Orioles.I\xe2\x80\x99ll warn you ahead of time, the rotation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t project well. But here goes (Again, for reference of what some of these stats mean,\xc2\xa0click here):1.\xc2\xa0Chris Tillman: 11-11, 4.31 ERA, 1.35 WHIP, 6.72 K/9I think, at this point, we have a pretty good idea\xc2\xa0what Chris Tillman is. He\xe2\x80\x99s somewhere in between last year and the year before, though closer to last year.In 2014, he had a 3.34 ERA and a 1.23 WHIP, which is, by all accounts, a really solid year from a starting pitcher. Then, last year, he ends up with a 4.99 ERA and a 1.39 WHIP, which is, by all accounts, a pretty bad year from a starting pitcher.So which Chris Tillman is he? Well, the answer lies somewhere in the middle, but unfortunately 2015 Chris Tillman is closer to accurate.In 2014, while he had a great 3.34 ERA, his FIP was 4.01, and when there\xe2\x80\x99s that much a discrepancy, red flags go up. Compare that to 2015, when his ERA was 4.99 and his FIP was 4.45, a bit less of a discrepancy.Also, in 2014, his HR/FB rate was only 8.3%, well below his career average of 11% (and the league average of 10%), and when you\xe2\x80\x99re pitching in Camden Yards, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to give up home runs.His control also got worse. He went from 2.86 BB/9 to 3.33 BB/9. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a huge increase, but it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting.So put all of this together, and we get a year last year that was worse than it should have been, and a year in 2014 that was better than it should have been, which is why I believe the truth is somewhere in between.2. Yovani Gallardo: 10-12, 4.42 ERA, 1.42 WHIP, 5.89 K/9Back when the Orioles were perusing the free agent market,\xc2\xa0I wrote an article\xc2\xa0about two (at the time) free agent pitchers they should avoid. One of those pitchers was Yovani Gallardo. Unfortunately, the Orioles did not listen to me (how could they not?!), and here we are with Gallardo in our starting rotation.The reasons I gave in that article are still the reasons I believe in now. Last year, Gallardo had a 3.42 ERA and an overall solid year, and it was a fluke. Every predictive stat suggests that.His 3.42 ERA was a career-best, and it came with a 4.00 FIP and 4.31 xFIP. His K/9 last year was 5.91, which is pretty below-average, especially since his career average is 8.23. Compare that with his oddly high LOB% (77.2), and you see the discrepancy.He\xe2\x80\x99s also had, and continues to have, control issues, issuing 3.32 BB/9 last year along with a 1.42 WHIP.In short, I expect Gallardo to walk a lot of batters, strike out very few, and give up a bunch of home runs (his career HR/FB is 11.0%, and that\xe2\x80\x99s with a bunch of years in the National League). Not a great starter, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if he can keep last year up.oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dBaltimore Orioles reliever Brad Brach: From afterthought to starring roleMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton Injury Isn't So Devastating2d - MLB: Laz Diaz strikes again - But the pitch was outside, of course2d - Boston Red Sox Coming Down Hard on Racism2d - Baltimore Orioles Zach Britton Out Six to Eight Weeks4d - Are the Red Sox and Orioles baseball's new rivalry?More News at Birds Watcher  3. Ubaldo Jimenez: 11-11, 4.19 ERA, 1.35 WHIP, 8.12 K/9Ubaldo is fascinating to me, and equally infuriating. Watching his epileptic seizure of a windup is so hypnotic to me sometimes, and it amazes me that he\xe2\x80\x99s ever able to get the ball remotely in the strikezone.Ubaldo is one of the most frustrating pitchers out there because he\xe2\x80\x99s so inconsistent. At times, he can look like his old Cy Young candidate days, and other times, you wonder why he\xe2\x80\x99s in the rotation at all.Ultimately what\xe2\x80\x99s happened to Ubaldo is diminished velocity. Back in his Colorado days, he was a fastball pitcher with decent off-speed stuff. He threw the ball about 96 MPH and had a killer two-seam fastball. Now, he throws the ball about 90 MPH, and his off-speed stuff hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed. The way a former fastball pitcher adjusts to diminished velocity (and it happens to all of them) is by having better off-speed pitches, or having better control. It\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between a fastball pitcher becoming Tim Lincecum or adjusting and staying Felix Hernandez.Ubaldo\xe2\x80\x99s control didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0get that much better, and his off-speed stuff didn\xe2\x80\x99t change much, which is why he went from a perennial Cy Young candidate, to what he is now.On occasion, Ubaldo looks awesome, and regardless, he strikes out a lot of guys, which is why I project him to have the highest K/9 on the team. His control got a lot better last year, so I\xe2\x80\x99m hopeful that he\xe2\x80\x99s tweaked something and his control will stay about what it was last year.4. Mike Wright: 7-10, 4.79 ERA, 1.40 WHIP, 6.10 K/9Mike Wright started off his major league career pretty well, with 14.1 scoreless innings. Combined with his prowess in the minor leagues, I was hoping Wright would turn into something good. Then he got crushed, with an 8.90 ERA the remainder of the season.Now, Wright is only 26, he has time to figure things out, and it seems like the Orioles are going to give him a gig in the rotation, at least for the time being. Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he spends the entire time in the rotation, I\xe2\x80\x99m projecting him for about 132 IP, which is a good amount, but not a ton.Wright ended last year with a 6.04 ERA, but a 5.70 xFIP gives me hope that a little of that was bad luck. He also had a HR/FB rate of 13.6%, which I believe will go down a little bit (thought not a ton, this is Camden Yards after all). He\xe2\x80\x99s also had some control issues, giving up 3.63 BB/9.I think Wright is going to have some struggles in the majors, but he has potential. He showed a good fastball and a good slider last year, and he\xe2\x80\x99s seemed to have figured out the minors, so hopefully he\xe2\x80\x99ll fulfill some of his potential this year. Perhaps Wright will break out sometime soon, and I think some time starting in the majors will be good for him to help figure things out.5. Kevin Gausman: 9-8, 4.02 ERA, 1.29 WHIP, 7.69 K/9I think Gausman is itching for a breakout season, and I really think this could be the year. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fan of how he got jerked around last year, I think he needed some time in the majors to figure himself out, and they gave him some of that, but he bounced around the minors and the majors too much.Despite the bouncing around, Gausman showed a lot of promise. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a killer fastball and a good slider, and if he can stay healthy, I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll turn into something really good.The health is key though, as of now he\xe2\x80\x99s starting the year on the DL, though it won\xe2\x80\x99t be too long. Health has plagued Gausman for awhile now, and hopefully things will be ok this year, I\xe2\x80\x99m projecting him for around 130 IP or so. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if he\xe2\x80\x99s handled\xc2\xa0a bit cautiously this year, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.Regardless, even if he struggles with giving up some runs (his 3.80 xFIP last year gives me some hope though), I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll strike out a lot of hitters. I\xe2\x80\x99m projecting him for the second-best K/9 on the team behind Ubaldo, and I think we could see a really good year from him.

In theory, that fifth starter would start out the season as a reliever. However let\xe2\x80\x99s think outside the box for a moment; could they not use that extra roster spot to include someone like Avery on the Opening Day roster \xe2\x80\x93 as opposed to carrying an additional reliever? That way you still have the spot for Kim, you can carry someone (Avery or someone else) who truly should be there, and for the very beginning at least you still have a fully-staffed bullpen.However the roster shakes down after tomorrow, it will all of course be temporary. However perhaps the scenario that I just gave above would give them a chance to \xe2\x80\x9cbury Kim on the bench,\xe2\x80\x9d which perhaps might make him think twice about allowing himself to be optioned.

USA TODAY Sports window.simpleExclusion = []; window.simpleTarget = []; Chris Davis struck out an AL-high 208 times last season.(Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREAs the 2016 Major League Baseball season begins, USA TODAY Sports\' baseball staff lays out its bold predictions for the six months ahead:***Playing half of their games at Camden Yards, which has finished in the top five in the majors in yielding homers in three of the last four years, it makes sense for the Orioles to load up on power hitters, even if they tend to be strikeout-prone.This time they have gone all-in.When Dexter Fowler left the Orioles at the altar and returned to the Chicago Cubs, the club had a lineup hole to fill and brought in Pedro Alvarez, a decision based on who was available on the market and what they could afford, not necessarily on who was the best fit. .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; } .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; } .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; } .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; } p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  } p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAY2016 MLB predictions: Our World Series picksThat signing cemented Baltimore at the clear favorite to shatter the major league record for strikeouts in a season, a mark held by the 2013 Houston Astros with 1,535.Consider:In ranking fifth in baseball with 1,331 whiffs last year, the Orioles had four 100-strikeout hitters \xe2\x80\x94 Chris Davis (208), Manny Machado (111), Jimmy Paredes (111) and Adam Jones (102). That\xe2\x80\x99s the same number as the 2013 Astros, who were led by Chris Carter\xe2\x80\x99s 212. Nobody else had more than 130.Not only has Baltimore added two whiff masters in Alvarez and Mark Trumbo, but Matt Wieters also has the potential to reach triple figures if he plays a full season. He has done it twice. The same goes for J.J. Hardy, another two-time culprit. And even second baseman Jonathan Schoop fanned 122 times in 2014.Of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 projected lineup, only left fielder Nolan Reimold has never struck out in triple figures. Then again, he has had as many as 305 plate appearances just once. With a full season, he could keep up with his teammates. Another left-field candidate, South Korean rookie Hyun Soo Kim, did not show a propensity for big strikeout totals back home but could face a difficult adjustment to the majors.A high strikeout incidence is nothing new for the Orioles, who have ranked in the top five in the American League in three of the last four years. They\xe2\x80\x99ve also hit the most homers in the majors twice in that span and finished no lower than third every season. .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; } .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; } .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; } .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; } p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  } p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYBold predictions: Cubs-Red Sox meet in World SeriesManager Buck Showalter has said he can live with the strikeouts as long as his sluggers do damage, and in Davis, Machado, Jones, Trumbo and Alvarez, Baltimore will have five hitters who averaged nearly 32 homers last season.But with a lineup so packed with swing-and-miss hitters, Camden Yards might resemble a wind tunnel this season.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInProjected Opening Day starters\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

04/03/2016,"[('Fantasy baseball names for all 30 major league teams ...', ' Your fantasy baseball team name can and will determine how well your team performs throughout the season. \xc2\xa0A weak name means you aren\'t take you seriously. \xc2\xa0A strong name shows power. \xc2\xa0It shows attitude. \xc2\xa0It shows determination.    Nobody cares about the $100 third place matchup between ""Team Kevin"" and ""Team Steve"" when there\'s a 5th place game strictly for pride and bragging rights between ""Where is A-A-Rod?"" and ""Steroids Made Me Bigbie."" That\'s the matchup everyone will be talking about around the coffee maker Monday morning. Thus, in the spirit of baseball season and fantasy baseball season, here are possible team names for each of the 30 MLB clubs, created to help spark the creative genius in us all. \xc2\xa0Enjoy! Baltimore Orioles: Bird Wars: The Yard AwakensIf the Orioles are the Resistance, Manny would be Rey (I know she\'s a female, but go with it), Jonesy would be Finn, and Crush Davis would be Poe Dameron providing the firepower which destroys the First Order\'s Starkiller Base. \xc2\xa0Or maybe Pedro Alverez or Mark Trumbo could be the hero, who knows?    Boston Red Sox: M is for Mookie, It\'s Good Enough for MeIf the Red Sox were on Sesame Street, O\'s fans would want their letter of the day to be L, for ""Last"" place in the AL East, or ""Losing"" to the O\'s, and hopefully not ""Lighting"" it up or ""Legit"" Contender.    New York Yankees: Where in Aroldis Carmen SanDiego?Cuba? \xc2\xa0Cincinnati? \xc2\xa0Los Angeles? \xc2\xa0New York? \xc2\xa0I think it\'s safe to assume Aroldis Chapman will at least be at home for the first month of the season. \xc2\xa0Maybe when he comes back this will be his entrance song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1EIUP8tvbE Tampa Bay Rays: Fabreeze Odorizzi ControlJake Odorizzi might not be great, but he helps cover some of the stink of an MLB franchise in Tampa Bay.    Toronto Blue Jays: Donaldson Trump\'s HairDonald Trump wants to make America great again. \xc2\xa0Josh Donaldson made Toronto great again last season. Coincidence...I think not. Chicago White Sox: Bring Your Kid to Work DayNow children of White Sox players can get a firsthand experience of what it\'s like to be in a major league clubhouse... Adam LaRoche is going to be so upset he retired. Minnesota Twins: Rodinson CarewsoHall of Famer Rod Carew meets 17th Century Legend Robinson Crusoe.    Kansas City Royals: The 3 LeftimigosDoes anyone else suspect that Mike Moustakas, Eric Hosmer, and Alex Gordon are triplets? Detroit Tigers: The Real Uptons of DetroitPilot Episode plot synopsis: When new teammate Justin Upton moves into the clubhouse, Justin Verlander must make a tough decision; stay faithful to a jealous Kate, or help his team compete in the AL Central. Cleveland Indians: 10 Cent Beer NightThe famous game when Indians management thought it was a good idea to sell unlimited 10 cent beers to 25 thousand angry fans. \xc2\xa0Sounds glorious I know, but these heavily intoxicated fans turns a regular baseball game into chaos. \xc2\xa0Here is the Wikipedia page for the event: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Cent_Beer_Night Seattle Mariners: Edgar\'s Designated WinnersThe greatest DH of all time might blast your team to a league championship. Oakland Athletics: Sonny Gray\'s AnatomyPainting the black is hard, just like brain surgery. \xc2\xa0It requires precision, pin-point accuracy, and set of big kahunas to perform under pressure. \xc2\xa0Derek Sheppard would be proud.    Los Angeles Angels: Basket Weavers and Matt ShoeMakersJared Weaver and Matt Shoemaker hope to lead a team with the best fish on the planet (Mike Trout) and the former greatest player (Albert Pujols) to an AL West crown. Houston Astros: The George Springer ShowRidiculous catches, monster home runs, and crazy onstage antics...what will happen on the next episode of the George Springer Show! Texas Rangers: \xc2\xa0Yu So DarvishA compliment everyone wants to hear. Philadelphia Phillies: Mike\'s Mustache RidesMike Schmidt: The Man, the Myth, the Mustache. \xc2\xa0His 548 home runs helped put this man\'s man in the Hall of Fame in \xe2\x80\x9895. \xc2\xa0Did you also know his middle name was ""Jack""? Washington Nationals: Dollar Beard ClubBryce Harper wants the new generation of player bring swag to the game. \xc2\xa0Is there anything more swag than chocolate syrup covering Jayson Werth\'s beard? \xc2\xa0Also, the Dollar Beard Club, similar to the Dollar Shave Club, will deliver beard grooming products straight to your door cheaper than the competition. \xc2\xa0Take a look: https://dollarbeardclub.com/    New York Mets: Get Down on DeGromAnother year better, Jake DeGrom and Company will be sending a lot of hitters back to the bench scratching their heads. Atlanta Braves: 14 Divisions, 1 CupNot a lot to say about this one. \xc2\xa0Braves fans look at 14 Division titles as a huge accomplishment, but you just can\'t help but feel disgusted they only got one ring out of it. Miami Marlins: Mike, but my Friends call me GiancarloMike Stanton was amazing. Then he went away... but Miami replaced him with the even more powerful Giancarlo. Pittsburgh Pirates: CharCole GrillsOpening Day you can use a Gerrit Cole fastball to light up your Weber One Touch to grill your favorite brats. Milwaukee Brewers: Mr. 3000Bad team, bad movie. \xc2\xa0Shout out to the late Bernie Mac.    Chicago Cubs: No More AAArrietaThis one hurts for O\'s fans. \xc2\xa0In Baltimore, Jake Arrieta was notorious for lighting it up in the minors, only to stink it up in the majors. \xc2\xa0I think it\'s safe to assume he\'s not going to be sent down again. St. Louis Cardinals: Carry on My Heyward SonHe might be an overrated fantasy player, but that doesn\'t mean the Cardinals aren\'t going to miss Jason Heyward. Cincinnati Reds: Bruceo, Bruceo, Bru-Ce-OOOHe happens to be everyone\'s favorite character from the movie Hook, starring Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts, and of course, Dante Basco as Rufio. San Francisco Giants - Even Year OctobersWorld Series Champs in 2010, 2012, 2014. \xc2\xa0Recent history tells us to put all our money on the Giants this year, 2018, 2020, and every even year for the rest of time. Arizona Diamondbacks: Jedi CounsellRumor has it Craig Counsell will be in Star Wars Episode VIII.    San Diego Padres: Straight Cashner HomieRandy Moss once said, ""Ask not what your fantasy team can do for you- ask what you can do for your fantasy team."" Start by giving your fantasy team a solid name. Los Angeles Dodgers: Puig or Pederson? \xc2\xa0I\'ll Take EthierThat\'s a joke. \xc2\xa0No one will take Andre Ethier. There you have it. \xc2\xa030 names for 30 teams. \xc2\xa0This doesn\'t even include the alternate names of ""The Ellsbury Dough Boy,"" ""Boggs Booze Airlines,"" or ""Macho Man Manny Savage."" Coming up with a good name requires effort. \xc2\xa0I like to start by thinking of current events (The upcoming presidential primaries for example), popular movies (Star Wars or a superhero flick), popular TV shows, new products, or beer. Beer helps. \xc2\xa0I am definitely not the most creative or witty person who can pop off names left and right, but it was fun coming up with the names. \xc2\xa0Hopefully you enjoyed this nonsense, and this article gets you thinking about a name that could spark some excitement in your upcoming fantasy season. I have to give a shout out to my brother Lenny Draheim with helping me come up with some of these names. \xc2\xa0We drank a many of Natty Boh while brainstorming this list. \xc2\xa0As gung-ho Oriole baseball fans, we are both extremely excited for the beginning of O\'s baseball. Also shout out to some my buddies Scuba Steve and Norm for providing some late inputs. \xc2\xa0Much appreciated!    Go O\'S! You can follow Hunter Draheim on Twitter @phdraheim.

Actually, it used to be gray. Now, preserved for ages, it is caked in Citi Field dirt, smeared from the bottom of the buttons up through the script across the chest.Eric Hosmer put it there with his daring dash in the ninth inning last Nov. 1 when he bolted for home on a groundout to third. Had the Mets thrown Hosmer out, the World Series would have shifted back to Kauffman Stadium, where the Royals would have faced Jacob deGrom in Game 6 and Noah Syndergaard in a potential Game 7.But Hosmer, of course, was not out. He dived safely across the plate, beating a wild throw from Lucas Duda. Three innings later, the Royals were champions. The World Series lasted 53 innings, and the Royals held the lead at the end of just 13. Yet they were always in control.A year and a half ago, it was easier to dismiss the Royals. They had nearly beaten San Francisco in the 2014 World Series \xe2\x80\x94 stranding the tying run on third base in Game 7 \xe2\x80\x94 but their charmed postseason had nearly died before it started, in a wild-card game they had barely survived.

Tomorrow the O\xe2\x80\x99s will take on Minnesota at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, and the games will truly count. No more fake baseball, no more scrutinizing over statistics that mean nothing \xe2\x80\x93 they all count from here on out!Courtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsSo what can fans expect from the 2016 O\xe2\x80\x99s? If you listen to certain groups and certain national pundits, they\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that this team has no chance. And for all we know, perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s true. Returning the home run king from two of the past three seasons (Chris Davis) with a new long-term contract can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly mean that this team has a shot at doing anything, right? The same might be true of returning one of their most effective relievers over the past few seasons in\xc2\xa0Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day. No shot, right?My point isn\xe2\x80\x99t that this team is going to reach the stars in 2016. It\xe2\x80\x99s that you can\xe2\x80\x99t count them out as some people have done. The big question mark of course is starting pitching. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters were \xe2\x80\x9chammered\xe2\x80\x9d last year, however they weren\xe2\x80\x99t as sharp as we would have expected either. That needs to change in 2016 if this team is going to contend.And the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some turnover in the starting rotation indicates that the staff is going to need to be on point this year.\xc2\xa0Miguel Gonzalez, a fan favorite, is now gone \xe2\x80\x93 and\xc2\xa0Mike Wright, a young guy who had a great sprin, is in. The Orioles will also benefit from the addition of\xc2\xa0Yovani Gallardo\xc2\xa0to the staff. And they hope that once he returns,\xc2\xa0Kevin Gausman\xc2\xa0will return to form as well.The bullpen was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 big strength the past few seasons, and with the return of O\xe2\x80\x99Day there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to assume that won\xe2\x80\x99t continue to be the case. He and\xc2\xa0Zach Britton anchor the back end of a bullpen that was as sure as anything in the game the past two years. With an unsure starting rotation, the importance of the \xe2\x80\x98pen is greater than ever.Offensively of course, the O\xe2\x80\x99s can flat out mash. The return of Davis was both unexpected (by some), and welcome. And the normal cast of characters around him will be the same \xe2\x80\x93 along with the likes of Wieters (who also returned, on a qualifying offer), Jones, Machado, Hardy, and Schoop, 2-16 shapes up to be a great year at the plate for the Orioles.

Once he got going, Alvarez had a decent spring and will nicely compliment the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense (which was already in good shape). And one of camp\xe2\x80\x99s biggest surprises was Rule 5 pick\xc2\xa0Joey\xc2\xa0Rickard, who dazzled the coaching staff with everything he did. The guy gets on base left and right however he is able, and quite frankly my vote would be for him to be the team\xe2\x80\x99s semi-regular lead off hitter.However the biggest advantage this team has over it\xe2\x80\x99s competition continues to be in the dugout. Buck Showalter is the master at knowing which buttons to push and when, along with managing the game several hitters (or in some cases innings) down the line. Needless to say, he\xe2\x80\x99s the best manager in the American League East. And that comes as a big advantage for the Orioles and their fans.So I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s prediction time. Lots of people and lots of other media outlets have asked me to give a prediction in terms of wins and losses for this team \xe2\x80\x93 some even before spring training began! And I\xe2\x80\x99ve always kicked the can down the road a bit. So now, one day before the start of the regular season, it\xe2\x80\x99s put up or shut up time.People love to say that the AL East isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good division anymore. Maybe it is, maybe it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. The competition is going to be fierce this season, needless to say. There\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance that four or five teams might enter September with a shot at making the playoffs in the AL East. So needless to say they\xe2\x80\x99ll beat up on each other, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance that the division winner might not even make it to 90 wins.So my prediction for the Orioles in 2016 is to finish at 86-76. Mind you that last season the Orioles finished squarely at .500, and that included a few stretches in which they could barely muster base hits in games. Heck, they were no-hit in Seattle. So if they can minimize that (perhaps by having a guy in Rickard who gets on base a lot), they should be good for a few extra wins year-over-year.It obviously remains to be seen whether or not 86 wins is enough to win the division or qualify for the post-season. But needless to say, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be competitive until the end. The Orioles will hold a team workout at Camden Yards this afternoon, and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll prepare for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Day festivities when Minnesota comes to town for a 3 PM first pitch.\xc2\xa0With all of that said, it\xe2\x80\x99s truly an honor to be back serving Orioles fans and the people of Baltimore for another season of Orioles baseball.

', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Hyun Soo Kim on Day One', 'Mar 1, 2016; Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles outfielder Hyun Soo Kim (25) at bat during the fifth inning of a spring training baseball game against the Atlanta Braves at Champion Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have announced the retention of Hyun Soo Kim after days of drama and attempts to get him to agree to additional time of adjustments at Norfolk.The move sends spring season standout Xavier Avery to AAA instead, while also retaining Nolan Reimold. Apart from some of the varied issues we will discuss here today, the move is consistent with historic Orioles functioning \xe2\x80\x94 doing all that can be done to retain every player on a bubble. This was the only way to keep all three, at least for now.One has to wonder what MLB Opening Day for Kim is going to look like and feel like. Though all fans hope for him (along with all other O\xe2\x80\x99s players) to have a great season, there is reason for skepticism about the Korean lefty, both at the plate and in the field.The question is if he is either being petulant in his insistence to enforce the contract or if he is genuinely clueless that he is not ready. The latter view puts him in a better light than the former possibility. In either event, this is an illustration of how a player-friendly contract that yields all of the leverage to the player is potentially harmful to the organization (all of the way down to the fanbase).And this again brings to speculation as to what Opening Day is going to hold. What will the greeting in the stadium be like when his name is called and he chugs down the orange carpet? It is not going to sound like that for fellow newcomer Joey Rickard. And what will this do for Kim\xe2\x80\x99s psyche? If a part of his refusal is related to some culturally-oriented aversion to \xe2\x80\x9cshame\xe2\x80\x9d about minor league demotion, what will a mildly hostile environment do to him? I don\xe2\x80\x99t see this fellow as a sort of Korean version of, say, Donald Trump in terms of resilience. But maybe $7 million helps anyone buck up to whatever public difficulty is at hand, I truly do not know of that personally.The Orioles fanbase has reacted to this in varied ways. The majority see Kim as foolishly stubborn, though some also blame the front office for creating the situation. Others are frustrated that Avery is not immediately available as a valuable lefty bat and defender, feeling he has suffered an injustice. A few also repeat the viewpoint that Reimold is not worthy of more chances and that he\xe2\x80\x99ll break down again somehow (when does the statute of limitations expire on that?).While believing that Kim has the ability to be successful and be what the O\xe2\x80\x99s hoped for in signing him originally, I have to say that I fall out mostly with the first view above: that he is being foolishly stubborn in not receiving wise American MLB baseball evaluation. All of the conversation that he just wants to play and help the team win falls short of the truth if he is not able to do that very thing on April 4th against the Minnesota Twins. And culture aside, it is not impressive that a professional athlete (an outfielder, not a DH) shows up more than just a bit overweight.

We will be glad to repent in dust and ashes and cheer his high batting average and OBP, even if he is (on his best day) slow to the ball in left field and weak in his throw to the infield.

If you would have told me this morning that\xc2\xa0Chris Tillman would have only pitched two innings and the O\xe2\x80\x99s would have only scored three runs, I would have said they would probably have been in trouble. But that\xe2\x80\x99s the beauty of this game \xe2\x80\x93 it plays wild tricks on us.Incidentally, this morning feels about as far back as the beginning of spring training at this point! After the Orioles finished with all the pomp and circumstance of Opening Day, the game promptly went into an hour and forty minute rain delay. The fans had waited six months for real baseball, what\xe2\x80\x99s another 100 minutes?!But once the game started, Chris Tillman was on. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 2.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 5 K. Yes folks, Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s outing was perfect this afternoon. Unfortunately for him, the umpires called for the tarp again after the second inning. Following another hour plus delay, the game resumed \xe2\x80\x93 with two new pitchers. It was only two innings and it was only the first game \xe2\x80\x93 but Tillman was dominant. Five strikeouts in two innings is tough to do.\xc2\xa0Live Feed matt wietersBaltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters Suits Up for His First Game Against Orioles The Baltimore WireWashington Nationals: 5 to watch in Beltway Series District on DeckNationals Matt Wieters: Top fantasy baseball catcher?

Rickard had about as good a day as one could have in his big league debut \xe2\x80\x93 2-for-4 and a run scored. Rickard also had the luxury of having his name chanted by the faithful at the yard late in the game. If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to write a scrip for your big league debut, that\xe2\x80\x99s about as good of a game as you could have.Following the second rain delay,\xc2\xa0Adam Jones gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 2-0 lead with a two-RBI double in the last of the fifth. The Orioles had brought\xc2\xa0Tyler Wilson in following the delay in relief of Tillman, which put him in line to get the win. However Minnesota battled back two innings later ith an RBI-double, and a sac fly-RBI to tie the game at two.That aforementioned sac fly-RBI went to left field, which is where Chris Rickard was playing. Rickard caught the ball in foul territory, leaving some folks clamoring that he should have let it go (since a run scored). With wto runners in scoring position and one out, if Rickard doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take that out Minnesota has two chances to record a two-RBI single.

Trumbo had some very professional at-bats in the game, however this one really took the cake when it was needed most. That allowed the Orioles to cover the corners, with Wieters striding to the plate.And yes folks, the rest is history. Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 RBI-single scored Davis from third, and delivered the Orioles a 3-2 win on Opening Day. It took longer than anyone would have thought, and it had it\xe2\x80\x99s share of weather drama, but the O\xe2\x80\x99s are winners on Opening Day.Make no mistake about the fact that this is a huge win for the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 and in a big manner at that. They were 0-8 dating back to 2014 against Minnesota, and thus they were swept against them last year. They would have had every excuse in the world to fall in this game, however the fact is that they hung in there and stuck with it. And they also exemplified one of the beautiful things about baseball \xe2\x80\x93 the home team\xe2\x80\x99s advantage in getting it\xe2\x80\x99s last at-bat. Ultimately at the end of the day, a win is always a win\xe2\x80\xa6but especially on Opening Day! Next: Baltimore Orioles open with Chris Tillman on the moundThe Birds will have a much-needed day off tomorrow, which ironically was the rain date for the opener.

But first thing\xe2\x80\x99s first\xe2\x80\xa6a day off! ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('The magic of Orioles baseball on the radio - Camden Chat', ' I was alone, annoyed, walking to the train station. It was Game 2 of the 2014 ALDS, and after watching Wei-Yin Chen get lit up for Tiger home runs for several brief minutes, I had pretty much lost hope for that game. But I had made plans already to see my aunt and uncle, and so I couldn\'t watch anymore. I plugged in my headphones for the 25 minute walk to the train station, bummed.    I grew up listening to Orioles games on the radio. We didn\'t have HTS, and so Jon Miller and Fred Manfra really were the basis for the beginning of my Orioles fandom. Still, televisions everywhere later in life had spoiled me. It was the playoffs, damn it, and I wanted to watch the Orioles - not listen to them like I had for most of my life. I was forgetting, though, that probably the most powerful Orioles moment I\'ve ever had had come from the radio. The 2014 ALDS, as I would see a few minutes later, was only one of several. *** I\'ll never forget the look on my dad\'s face as we sat, eating dinner, briefly interrupting watching Game 1 of the 1996 ALCS. He wasn\'t a sports fan, really, at all, but my 10 year old self was into it, and so my family was nice enough to keep the old radio on during dinner, a rare treat.    It was a few bites through salad that Jon Miller\'s voice elevated.    ""Tarasco back...and a fan takes the ball away from him!"" We rushed downstairs to watch the argument, Davey Johnson losing his mind, Jeter horribly circling the bases, the Yankee Stadium crowd going mad. The key moment, however, had happened on the radio. Hearing Miller\'s voice allowed us to react to the moment in a way that we wouldn\'t had experienced by watching it. It allowed us to live it with someone else, not just in the prisons of our own beaten baseball minds. And it\'s always better, or more emotional, at least, if you live it with someone else.    I\'ve seen that Jeffrey Maier play over and over again now, seen Tarasco pointing upward. But I\'ll always experience it through my dad\'s expression, and through me rushing downstairs to see what exactly had happened on the television. 1996, really, was the beginning of my Orioles fandom, in some ways. That season I started keeping the radio on late, ear pressed firmly to the holes on the speakers, volume low as could be\xc2\xa0so my parents wouldn\'t know I had it on. I heard that season through my straining ears, and I\'ll never forget hearing the Orioles play the Blue Jays, winning late on a sacrifice fly to cap a wild 11-10 victory, then hearing a WTOP breaking news interruption that TWA Flight 800 had crashed into the ocean. It will always stick with me - a truly scary and shellshocked moment for the tired, stayed-up-way-too-late 10 year old that I was. I wasn\'t quite old enough in 1997 to stay up late to watch games, so I heard the conclusion of ALCS Game 4 while sitting upright in my bed, not bothering to keep the volume on low at that point. When I heard Sandy Alomar single in the winning run to give the Indians the victory and a 3-1 series lead, I was introduced to true despondent Orioles fandom for the first time. It was the first time I remember thinking that they had gotten this far, and it didn\'t look like they were going to get any further, and that I didn\'t know when I would experience playoff baseball or sports success this deep again. It was the beginning of being the jaded sports fan that all of us - except maybe fans from Boston in recent years - become at some point.    And I remember listening with radio on very, very low as Edgar Renteria singled in the winning run in the World Series that year, hoping that one day I could silently dance around my room, radio still on low, as the Orioles won it all and I could celebrate in secret, not letting my parents know that I was awake at\xc2\xa0midnight\xc2\xa0on a school night. *** The radio came and went from 1998-2013. I went to school, moved away from the DC area, remained a fan after the Nationals came. I mostly listened to games on the radio since I couldn\'t watch them out of market. It was mostly a sad state. But I should have appreciated it a bit more when I put in my headphones and was able to walk down the street, listening to the eighth inning of Game 2 in 2014. I should have known that this was something that was deeply bringing me back to my childhood. The hope built slowly. Once Steve Pearce singled in Adam Jones to make it a three run game, I somehow believed a little bit. I had some time before myt rain left, and so I walked to a nearby bar to see if I could see any TVs from outside, but to no avail. But it was OK. It was right for me to listen to that game on the radio, now far away from my childhood bedroom, but still having the same experiences and feelings I had as a 10 year old. It was 6-4, and the Tigers made a pitching change. I had five minutes until my train. I walked into the bathroom. Delmon Young came up.    ""Line drive down the left field line!"" I remember, Joe Angel making the call. I stared at the bathroom walls, not moving, almost not believing what was coming into my ears. I honestly don\'t remember the entire call. I just remember it playing out in my head, a thousand thoughts a moment coming through, somehow my young self willing on the runners who existed only for myself, not on some pixelated screen in front of me. And then the final call, about JJ Hardy. ""Safe!"" I got on the train, and it began to whisk me away to New York. Of course, I was still listening, but everything was perfect from that point on. Zach Britton came on, and he got the three outs, but after that hit that felt like a foregone conclusion. It was a cathartic party for all of us O\'s fans. I\'ll always treasure, though, that the greatest Orioles moment of the past 18 years, for sure, was a private moment for me. And through a stroke of fate, it was connected to my beginnings as an Orioles fan. I\'ll be listening to the radio this season. I\'ll jump up and down in my house when Chris Davis hits a no-doubter, and I\'ll be on the edge of my seat as the rotation tries to muddle through. I\'ll watch games when I get the chance. But for me, and probably for a lot of us, baseball started on the radio, and it remains there in a very powerful sort of way. If the Orioles ever win it all in my lifetime, you can bet I\'ll get a recording of the final out, and I\'ll be 10 again, silent in my bedroom, dancing around quietly at night.

Buck Showalter indicated a similar sentiment after the game in his press conference. But that\xe2\x80\x99s life in baseball. It\xe2\x80\x99s the price these guys pay for playing the best sport in the world, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the price I pay for covering it!While I understand the need for it and so forth, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always disliked the token day off after Opening Day. It\xe2\x80\x99s only one day, but it\xe2\x80\x99s always felt like an eternity to me! So with that said, what do we know so far about this Orioles team? The answer is not too much \xe2\x80\x93 yet. The good news I suppose is that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had to make a roster move as of yet. Last year you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall Chris Davis was suspended for the first game in Tampa and was activated as soon as the game had ended.While we still don\xe2\x80\x99t know much, yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game should offer just a ray of hope to the crew who says that this team is doomed. Mind you, they still very well may or may not be doomed \xe2\x80\x93 we just don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet. However we were all under the impression that the 2016 O\xe2\x80\x99s would be a homer-happy group who in effect struggle to get on base and who\xe2\x80\x99s starting pitching would have it\xe2\x80\x99s struggles. Speaking for myself personally, I predicted a 7-5 victory for the Birds before the game yesterday.

Granted, for all we know Tillman would have totally fallen apart in the third inning onward had the game not been delayed. But all we can analyze is what we saw \xe2\x80\x93 and in facing six hitters Tillman struck out five. That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty impressive.Furthermore the O\xe2\x80\x99s won this game without hitting a home run. Adam Jones came close, and perhaps if it was mid-June instead of a dreary April day he would have. But while the run production wasn\xe2\x80\x99t great (three runs), the point is that they came without the use of a homer. On the flip side, obviously the bullpen surrendered the lead late in the game \xe2\x80\x93 something we aren\xe2\x80\x99t used to seeing. But again you can\xe2\x80\x99t totally knock them, as this was a long day overall that at a certain point probably got some guys off-kilter.Courtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsSpeaking of which, my biggest takeaway on this game was the fact that this is still a very resilient bunch of guys. There\xe2\x80\x99s no team who\xe2\x80\x99s psyche wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be affected by two long rain delays, poor conditions, and the low of having to wait around for so long after such a wonderful Opening Day ceremony. However this Oriole team hung in there and won it on one swing of the bat by Matt Wieters in the last of the ninth.

Two outs were recorded in that ninth inning when guys swung for the fences. Admittedly, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably human nature when you\xe2\x80\x99re in that situation to end the game with one swing. But it ended up being a base hit and a walk that made the difference. Get guys on base, and good things will happen.And incidentally, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lesson in that final sequence of the game. Chris Davis was at first base when Mark Trumbo came to bat. Minnesota went into a \xe2\x80\x9cno doubles defense,\xe2\x80\x9d which in effect pushes the outfielders all the way to the wall. It\xe2\x80\x99s similar to a \xe2\x80\x9cprevent defense\xe2\x80\x9d in the NFL \xe2\x80\x93 which as we know effectively \xe2\x80\x9cprevents you from winning.\xe2\x80\x9d Now I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be overly critical of Minnesota for playing that type of defense, because in baseball it\xe2\x80\x99s probably the right play (on a double, a guy might be able to score from first base). However it certainly came across as playing it safe.And believe me folks, nobody plays it safe as much as I do \xe2\x80\x93 in all aspects of life. However in playing it safe, Minnesota was defenseless on a single up the middle. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what Trumbo hit; the center fielder had to run all the way back in to field the ball, allowing Davis to go to third. Granted he still would have been in scoring position, but you get the point. Next: Baltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters walks off after a long dayAt the end of the day\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 a very long day at that \xe2\x80\x93 we can\xe2\x80\x99t say anything concrete about this Orioles team.

Starter Chris Tillman did indeed look the best he has ever looked. Any of you reading this who were maybe stuck at work and did not see his two innings before the rain delay, but have heard multiple sources use the grandiose \xe2\x80\x9cbest ever\xe2\x80\x9d terminology, it is in fact completely true. His velocity was high \xe2\x80\x94 in the mid 90s. There was some late fastball movement, though that is not his game. But the velocity consistently on the corners can have the same effect. And Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s breaking stuff was crisp and tight. Striking out five of six batters, it was totally nasty stuff.Tyler Wilson was solid in his three innings. He\xe2\x80\x99s a true pitcher and can handle a jam without cracking. Of 39 pitches in three scoreless innings, 27 were strikes.The bullpen was typically effective, with the one criticism being that Mychal Givens was brought out for a second inning, thereby giving up the two Twins runs. Though he will need to be called upon for multiple innings during the season, it was probably not Buck\xe2\x80\x99s best call to bring him back on a damp opening day \xe2\x80\xa6 with an open day on the schedule following.All totaled, the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers gave up just seven hits and NO walks. Gotta love that, also striking out 10.On the other side, the Orioles also struck out 10 times. However, they picked up five walks along with their 10 base hits, including four singles by Mark Trumbo. He hits the ball so hard that he just drives grounders through the infield.The narrative about the 2016 Birds is that they are going to live and die by the home run. Well, they are still looking for the first of the season. However, in summer weather, three balls would have gone out of the park: an early fly by J.J. Hardy, the two-RBI double by Adam Jones, and a Chris Davis blast to the wall in straightaway center field. There will be home runs.Whereas 10 hits and five walks would seem to portend more than merely three runs scored, the Orioles actually were 4-for-11 with runners in scoring position. That\xe2\x80\x99s a keeper RISP average.Yesterday we wrote about batting orders, noting how Showalter put Rickard at the bottom to launch his new career.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsNew Baltimore Orioles starter Yovani Gallardo will make his debut tonight against the Minnesota Twins in the second game of the season.Gallardo represents a great measure of hope for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to bolster the rotation and provide some innings-eating consistency. His historic record would argue that he will be able to do this. Gallardo\xe2\x80\x99s past seven seasons have seen him throw between a low of 180 innings to a high of 207.His lowest ERA of those years was in 2015 with a 3.42 in Texas. However, at the same time, last year saw his highest WHIP number at 1.416.\xc2\xa0 Those two stats do not logically go together very well. But Gallardo induces a high number of ground balls, thus limiting the damage. And he has also been highly effective at pitching with runners on base and stranding them there.Those are skills he is going to need in Baltimore, especially keeping the ball on the ground. This defense can help him in that regard.In that Gallardo pitched in Milwaukee prior to his 2015 season in Texas, he does not have many extensive records against Twins hitters. However, Joe Maurer is 5-for-11 and Brian Dozier is 5-for-10 with a home run. Trevor Plouffe is 3-for-7 with two homers.On the other side, Kyle Gibson starts for Minnesota. Their most consistent pitcher in 2015, Gibson will seek to build on a season where he had a 3.82 ERA in 32 starts. Gibson started twice against the Orioles last year with a win and a no-decision. Both games he gave up but two earned runs.J.J. Hardy and Mark Trumbo are both 1-for-5 with a home run against the Twins\xe2\x80\x99 starter. Adam Jones is 1-for-8, Manny Machado 2-for-6, and Chris Davis 0-for-5. Ryan Flaherty has been 2-for-4, so could we see him in the starting lineup? Buck likes to break the ice with his players early in the year. But at the same time, Jonathan Schoop is 2-for-4. Pero Alvarez has never faced Gibson, so maybe Flaherty could be the DH today.

But better even than the solo home run was the great defensive play by Crush. He saved an errant throw from J.J. Hardy and has looked like a 20-year-old at first base with his nimble movements.

And as expected, Joey Rickard has signed on to play Superman in the next unwatchable Zack Snyder movie, an easy decision for Warner Brothers after a 4-for-7 start at the plate. Yay for small sample sizes! Where the Orioles have seen their fair share of early eye-openers, Yovani Gallardo\'s club debut went about as well as any realistic Baltimore person could have expected. It wasn\'t bad, nor good. Inflating, nor deflating. Gallardo was simply...solid.    Much was made to do with Gallardo\'s declining velocity and inability to go deep into games, and in his Baltimore coronation, Gallardo followed suit. Allowing only one run to go with two hits, three walks and four strikeouts, the 30 year-old Mexican righty exited the game with a two-run lead after five innings.    In a classic FIP-defying start, Gallardo sweated through the slight majority of the ballgame, and it\'s likely this is going to be the kind of pitcher we see throughout his Orioles tenure. For better or worse, I\'m sure you want to know why. Again, a statement of fact, Gallardo is no longer the pitcher he used to be. A pitcher that has seen his K% slowly evaporate from 23.7%, 18.6%, 17.9%, to 15.3% over the past four years, he\'s learned to be creatively cautious.       Yovani Gallardo First Orioles Start     Pitch Type Average Velo (Max) Count   Four-Seam Fastball 89.3 (90.0) 10   Two-Seam Fastball 89.1 (89.9) 13   Changeup 87.2 (89.0) 12   Slider 86.4 (89.0) 43   Curveball 78.2 (82.8) 11    Without much disparity in velocity, Gallardo forced himself to mix and match his entire array of pitches in order to fight through five long innings. I\'d imagine PITCHf/x was unable to decipher a few sliders from other offerings, say, a cutter, but that doesn\'t take away his reliance on his favorite pitch. As unpredictable as he was with repertoire, Gallardo was just as savvy in his placement.             Granted, Gallardo lived dangerously on occasion by missing Wieters\' glove up in the zone with his slider, but I\'m inclined to believe he pitches around the hands of hitters for effect. By using the slider at a higher frequency, especially towards the top of the zone, the fastball becomes an illusion, more so with two strikes. Gallardo\'s slider breaks more vertically downwards than horizontally, and as a hitter down in the count, you expect to see a pitch breaking to your knees, not rising above your hands.              <picture class=""c-picture"" data-cid=""site/picture_element-1494653042_8687_9482"" data-cdata=\'{""picture"":true,""dynamic_picture"":false,""convert_picture"":false}\'>            <img srcset=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ZsiKpvZQWQXIhJ98qYolxyLQNY=/0x0:718x404/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ds1jYzESoHTGt2TG4Y4R3VyIItI=/0x0:718x404/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RcGNRtofppYp-oc6adWl4UQT9TU=/0x0:718x404/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X0C-y_unWFnUASs0M1ylwHD4us0=/0x0:718x404/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 920w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9M02UwlPjrX41etafMArq_60dSE=/0x0:718x404/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 1120w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38PnxY56KF1RzrK4HDbrhsd7P-I=/0x0:718x404/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 1320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s1VgtPNJ7_T06UpU79vyE4DE8xc=/0x0:718x404/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 1520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5XncXJwCCU7gyzjMwUKIQPatao=/0x0:718x404/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 1720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s17ASDUZt1Mh0joDo2SJYHK2Tug=/0x0:718x404/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 1920w"" sizes=""(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4NhQvgsRQB3KYQ_8eAUpEOIhfCc=/0x0:718x404/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif"">  </picture>          That split-second deciphering from a slider to a fastball can cause swings like this of Trevor Plouffe\'s, even at 88 MPH.             In what was a night of weak contact for the Twins, Gallardo\'s trade-off was throwing an average of 17.8 pitches per inning. As PITCHf/x shows, Gallardo didn\'t cave to the pressure of meaty fastballs on the inner-half of the plate. Instead, Gallardo avoided the middle of the plate early in counts, using the right side and lower-half of the plate to set up hitters higher in zone. Gallardo obviously had a plan of attack, and though he wasn\'t as crisp as we\'d hope to see, it worked nonetheless. By cutting, sinking and spinning the baseball, Gallardo isn\'t going to give many hitters the opportunity to square him up, no matter the situation. Unfortunately, that does come at the risk of prolonging at bats. Gallardo fits in with the Orioles current rotation because his stuff doesn\'t afford him the risk of missing over the plate, but sometimes pitching is more finesse than sheer power. Gallardo wasn\'t trying to fool anyone when he explained how he\'s had to change his style, and as Wednesday night proved, it\'s a formula that can work. There are going to be frustrations in how Gallardo goes about his business, but changing speeds and eye-levels is the foundation of pitching. Mid-90\'s fastballs aren\'t always necessary. Forced to shed his former-self, Gallardo isn\'t going to ""wow"" us. His scheduled starts may even come with a passing yawn. But like most of his new teammates, he\'s different.    And I\'m a sucker for different. *Stats and media courtesy of Brooks Baseball and MLB.com*  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""O\\u2019s sweep Twins behind Joey Rickard's first career HR ..."", '  Ubaldo Jimenez, looking to build on a strong 2015 season that admittedly saw him falter in the second half, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t great out of the gate. He struck out the first batter he faced but allowed a solo shot to Joe Mauer to put the Orioles in a 1-0 hole. It would\xe2\x80\x99ve been a two-run dinger if Danny Santana, who\xe2\x80\x99d reached first base on a drag bunt, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been erased trying to steal second base. Caleb Throwseph has returned to play ball.  In the second inning, Eduardo Escobar singled into left field before John Ryan Murphy reached base on a weird play. He rocketed a ball directly at Chris Davis, who (according to the official scorer anyway) missed it. The ball skipped off the bag, bounced high into the air, and came to rest in between the rolled-up tarp and the first-base fence. Mark Trumbo did that thing where the fielder puts both hands in the air, and Escobar, who\xe2\x80\x99d crossed the plate easily, was sent back to third. He scored one batter later when Byron Buxton grounded out to J.J. Hardy. 2-0 Twins.  Jimenez may have been a bit rattled, or just a bit off to start the season, because he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the strike zone at all in the top of the 3rd. It looked like he was taking pitching tips from his 2014 self. His pitches were high in the zone and were often wide. Santana singled and stole second before moving to third base on a Mauer single. In a tight 2-0 game with no outs, it looked like a bad inning for the Orioles. But Jimenez recovered to strike out Miguel Sano and got a double-play comebacker from Trevor Plouffe.  From then on Jimenez was very difficult to hit. He struck out two batters in the 4th, one in the 5th, two in the 6th, and two in the 7th for a total of nine. Now, experienced Orioles fans are saying ""yeah, but how many did he walk?"" The answer is zero. ZERO.  Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line for the night was a very good 7 IP, 7 H, 9 K, 0 BB, HR, ER. He hadn\'t struck out nine while walking zero since September 19, 2013. The Orioles offense needed this performance because they struggled for most of the game. They had a good chance to score in the 4th but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come through. With Nolan Reimold and Manny Machado at the corners with no one out, Chris Davis, Mark Trumbo, and J.J. Hardy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring anyone home. It took until the 6th inning for the Orioles to score. They did it on a solo shot by Machado, on a fastball several inches inside, to make it 2-1 Twins.  The team broke through in the eighth. Again with runners on the corners thanks to back-to-back singles by Trumbo and Hardy, a brief rain delay ensued, bringing Trevor May in for starter Phil Hughes. May uncorked a wild pitch that scored Trumbo, tying the game at 2, and sending Hardy to second. One batter latter, Jonathan Schoop singled up the middle to bring home Hardy as the go-ahead run. 3-2 Orioles.  Franchise savior Dylan Bundy, pitching on 1,290 days of rest, was asked to hold the lead in the 8th, and hold it he did. He pitched around a single by Miguel Sano, and the inning ended when Sano\xe2\x80\x99s pinch-runner Eduardo Nunez was nailed stealing second by an absolute laser from Joseph. Bundy pumped his fist, smiled, and gracefully shouldered the expectations of an entire city and its fanbase before walking off the mound.  But in between innings, Bundy confided to Rule 5 pick Joey Rickard that he just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle all the pressure, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t Joey please help out? Rickard obliged with a solo homer, the first of his big-league career, to put the Orioles up 4-2. With the fans chanting ""JO-EY! JO-EY! JO-EY!"", Rickard shyly took a curtain call. Adorable!  Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day came in to get the save and did so by striking out the side in order. SWEEP!  The Orioles rise to 3-0 on the season while the Twins fall to the reverse. Tomorrow the Tampa Bay Rays start game four of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 season. It\xe2\x80\x99s a battle of the Chrises, as Archer opposes Tillman on the hill.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

For reference, FanGraphs says a WHIP of 1.00 or below is excellent and the average WHIP in 2015 was 1.29.1.12 strikeouts per inning pitched, which translated to 10.08 strikeouts per nine innings. A K/9 inning rate of 10.0 is rated as excellent. In 2015, the average K/9 inning for starters was 7.40.Now, the Twins aren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly the best hitting team in the world. Their average last year was .247, 26th in the league. Their on-base percentage was .305, 28th in the league.So, what can we take from these 2.5 starts? Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s not jump to any vast conclusions. Only two teams in baseball have allowed fewer runs so far, and they played each other in the first series, and also in the World Series last year.\xc2\xa0 The Mets and Royals also have only played two games at this point, allowing four and five runs respectively.But, what we can see is that the Orioles starting pitchers are off to a good start.\xc2\xa0 If the team can average six innings pitched throughout the year, it will allow Buck Showalter to continue his mastery of the bullpen.The other thing that appears to be the case, much like it was in 2014, is that the rotation is feeding off of a good start.

They ended up settling for being the lone remaining unbeaten team in the majors.A makeup date was not immediately announced. Tampa Bay\'s next series in Baltimore is June 24-26.The weather was cold and rainy for much of the day, and the forecast for the 7:05 p.m. game time was 39 degrees with a 50 percent chance of precipitation.""It\'s going to be cold,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""But we play games.

""But both teams are playing in it. We\'ll adjust.""After the Orioles took batting practice, the grounds crew covered the field with a tarp. The rain stopped around 7 o\'clock, and play was scheduled to begin at 7:40.But another freezing rain shower brought the tarp back on at 7:38, and not long after that the game was called.The teams will attempt to complete the abbreviated two-game series on Sunday.

Hardy back in the lineup. Jones has missed two games with a sore ribcage and Hardy was out Friday night with strained left calf.Neither player was in the starting lineup Saturday because of the cold weather.Steve Pearce was slated to bat fifth and play first base for Tampa Bay in what was going to be his first game at Camden Yards since he left the Orioles for the Rays during the offseason.Pearce came to Baltimore in 2012 and was a key contributor to the 2013 AL East champions.""Always could count on him,"" Showalter said.

The on-base percentage against him in both the first and second innings of pitching over his career is a not-so-great .348 in each. After that it settles down to much lower numbers. Tillman actually improves as games go along, which is backwards relative to most starters. Here is the career average of batters against him in the first, second, third and fourth times through the lineup: first = .269, second = .244, third = .240, and fourth = .208 (only a total of 52 plate appearances, but still impressive).Secondly, Tillman pitches much better with the bases empty and from the wind-up. In those situations he has an average against of .247 versus .258 with runners on base. That is not dramatically different and is probably true of most pitchers.But making it worse than it first appears is that Tillman too often (compared to most top starters) allows first batters of games and first batters in an inning on base. With game leadoff batters, his BAA/OBP is .287/.353, and with leadoff hitters in an inning it is .255/.323.\xc2\xa0 That .255 is the exact batting average of all hitters in the American League in 2015, and the OBP against Tilly is higher than the AL average of .318.But Chris Tillman pitched out of whatever jams he was in on Friday night, and his ball movement is clearly much better than in 2015, as is the velocity. This looks pretty good and bodes well for the future and for this season.So, I usually don\xe2\x80\x99t look at standings for at least several weeks of the season, but I looked to see if anyone else was still unbeaten in the AL, and yes, Detroit is 3-0. But they beat the Yankees, so that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.And we can\xe2\x80\x99t go getting too excited too quickly (just like we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get too depressed because it took 13 attempts to win a spring training game). The 2011 Baltimore Orioles started the season 5-0 and won eight of the first nine. But then they went 61-92 the rest of the way.Tracking and Prorating Home Runs and Strikeouts More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryAs written in the preseason, throughout the 2016 season here on The Baltimore Wire we will keep track of the pace of the Orioles relative to both home runs and strikeouts. For example, if the Orioles have over 500 strikeouts in the first 54 games (exactly one-third of a season), we will know that are on their way to challenging the all-time strikeout record of 1553.With only four games played, the current stats don\xe2\x80\x99t mean much, but to get the graph started on the season, here is where we are at this point \xe2\x80\xa6MLB All-Time HRsO\xe2\x80\x99s All-Time HRsO\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 Pace264 (Seattle \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9897)257 (1996)284MLB All-Time K\xe2\x80\x99sO\xe2\x80\x99s All-time K\xe2\x80\x99sO\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 Pace1553 (Hous \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9813)1331 (2015)1175\xc2\xa0So there is much to be encouraged about, even if it is only four games.

04/10/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles Winning the Bullpen Game So Far', 'Friday night was another successful game for the Baltimore Orioles, as the entire team shined once again.A baseball analysis could say there are five phases to the game. There is the offense, defense, base-running, starting pitching, and relief pitching.Each of these segments of the game could deserve their own article, and will as time goes on.The Baltimore Orioles so far have gotten fantastic starting pitching, as discussed here.The base-running has been very good. For a team without a lot of speed, base-running comes down to taking extra bases where available, and not running into outs. So far, so good.The offense has been excellent. Hitting home runs, including a barrage off of ace Chris Archer\xc2\xa0on Friday night. Patient at-bats were common, highlighted by Matt Wieters at-bat in the fourth inning, where he worked Archer for 10 pitches and drove an RBI single into left field.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 defense is always fantastic, and their one error so far probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an error.That leaves us with relief pitching. Everyone expected the Baltimore Orioles to have a very good bullpen this year. They brought back Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day on a big contract. They have closer Zach Britton, one of the best in baseball. Brad Brach has proven himself to be a very good set-up guy, and Brian Matusz is a capable left-handed specialist.Many people thought that Dylan Bundy and Mychal Givens would only help the already deep Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen. And then, there are guys like TJ McFarland, who was excellent on Friday night, to fill in as long relief.Statistically, the bullpen has pitched 17 innings so far, fifth most in the major leagues. Of course, this number is skewed by the short start Chris Tillman had on opening day due to the rain delay.The bullpen ERA over those 17 innings is 1.59, which is the eighth-best so far in the majors, but fourth-best in the AL East. The Blue Jays are the only one worse, and their bullpen has been a dumpster fire so far.Admittedly, it is a small sample size. But, for Oriole fans, there is one other thing to take note of here.All of the runs have been allowed by one person: Mychal Givens.Givens has pitched two innings of the 17 the team has pitched so far, yet has allowed the only three runs. After 2015, many thought the converted short stop was ready for a permanent spot in the O\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen. But he has struggled a bit so far this year, with 5 H allowed, 3 ER, 1 HR, 1 HBP. In 2015, Givens pitched 30 innings and allowed six runs. In 2016, Givens has pitched two innings and allowed three runs.

Does Givens go to AAA Norfolk to get a little more seasoning, or does the team send down long relievers Tyler Wilson or TJ McFarland?

They are currently playing very well. Now we just need the spring weather to play along.

Mandatory Credit: Butch Dill-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles advanced \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d affiliate Frederick Keys shut out the Myrtle Beach Pelicans on Saturday evening, 6-0.Without an Orioles baseball game to follow and comment upon due to the winter weather last evening, I was able to fulfill my baseball fix by watching the Keys play on MiLB TV.Watching a minor league baseball game online has all the local fixins\xe2\x80\x99 that come along with the in-person experience, including all of the between-innings festivities. In Myrtle Beach this included a hoagie eating contest, a dog that brought baseballs to the umpire in a cloth basket, and advertisements for vacation trips and flights to \xe2\x80\xa6 wait for it \xe2\x80\xa6 West Virginia!Stimulating my interest in watching this particular game was the starting pitcher, Matthew Grimes. Through a set of circumstances, my wife and I have opened our home to host this very fine young man for this season or for whatever duration he has in Frederick. This is a first-time experience for us, but having young men in the house is nothing new. Four of our five sons have now grown up and moved out, only a college junior remains.If Grimes continues to pitch as he did tonight, his time with us might be fairly short. He threw five shutout innings for the win, giving up four hits and striking out seven, with no walks allowed. Matthew is 6\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d and throws over the top with a fastball that reaches at times to 96 mph. His game is to use his size to throw downhill and work the bottom of the zone, mixing in a variety of pitches.Grimes was a 2014 selection of the Orioles in the 18th round out of Georgia Tech. The Georgia native was among the top high school prospects in 2010, as evidenced by his fourth round selection by the White Sox. But he chose the Yellow Jackets instead and began his college career with a very good freshman year. But then came Tommy John surgery the following season, and he is really just now getting fully back to form at age 24.The 2015 season was a full year for Matthew, though his innings were capped. He pitched 126 at DelMarVa with a 10-7 record and 4.14 ERA.\xc2\xa0 His second half of the season was much improved over the earlier portion.The Keys offence gave Grimes a nice four-run lead in the top of the first inning. The big blow was a two-run shot by Aderlin Rodriguez, a Dominican player signed in the offseason by the O\xe2\x80\x99s to a minor league contract. He has been banging around the minors since signing with the Mets in 2008. Now age 24 and playing first base, he is a sizeable and athletic specimen at 6-3, 210. He also added a double and has started the season 6-for-14. With a great swing, batting cleanup, Rodriguez is an eye-catcher on this squad.The Keys feature four top-30 prospects on the roster, including Jomar Reyes who added a triple last night. At only age 19, the third baseman hit .278 in 84 games with the Shorebirds last year.While Reyes was ranked by Baseball America as the #4 prospect for the Orioles, the Keys also have #11 (Tanner Scott), #15 (Jonah Heim), and #28 (Josh Hart).Scott is already known to O\xe2\x80\x99s fans as the lefty with the 100 mph fastball, a rare talent. Between Aberdeen and DelMarVa, Scott threw 42.1 innings while striking out 60. The ERA was 3.83.

Four different special uniforms for the 2016 season were unveiled on Wednesday afternoon. The Orioles will be saddled with these uniforms on Mother\'s Day, Memorial Day, Father\'s Day, and Independence Day. They range from, ""Well, that\'s nice"" to ""What feather-brain green-lit this monstrosity?"" Though they look ridiculous, I am aware that most and perhaps all of the special uniforms and hats will be auctioned off to benefit some kind of cause that is at least nominally charitable. For instance, last year\'s Fourth of July jerseys/caps were auctioned off with the proceeds benefiting the Orioles Charitable Foundation, while last year\'s Memorial Day uniforms and caps were auctioned, with proceeds going to support the Fort Meade Alliance.    It\'s safe to guess that the Mother\'s Day and Father\'s Day uniforms and caps, which are pink and blue, respectively, for the colors of breast cancer awareness and prostate cancer awareness, will be autographed and auctioned with proceeds going to some kind of charitable cause as well.

Do you think that he or she looks upon that finished product and feels a sense of satisfaction and thinks, ""Nailed it!"" Or do you think they are aware of what kind of abomination they have unleashed on the world, and that it leaves them feeling a little dead inside to know that they played a part in creating it?    Actually, the star pattern is the same for all 29 American teams. The only things different between them are the team logo that sits over the stars and whether the cap\'s primary color is red or blue. Toronto gets maple leafs instead, obviously. Also, the Orioles will be wearing light blue uniforms when playing the Blue Jays. That\'s just wrong! Not that anyone should have a hard time telling apart who\'s who, since one team will be in home whites and the other will be in road greys, but still. It\'s the principle of the thing. How many weird uniforms does one baseball season need? Are we far off from the first day of summer and the first day of fall being deemed worthy of specially-designed uniforms? Think of the falling leaf patterns they could use and the many colors! I\'d better not give them any ideas.    If there\'s any consolation, it\'s that each one of these peculiar things will be worn for only one game and then things will go back to normal. Though of course, if the O\'s do something really great on any one of these games, they\'ll have to keep wearing the uniforms until their luck runs out. Like what if someone throws a no-hitter on Memorial Day? Camo for the rest of the week! That\'s just science. We could have it worse than the above.

Baltimore will try to bash its way to a series sweep and an 8-0 record to begin the season when it visits the Boston Red Sox for the finale on Wednesday. Baltimore rode its pitching staff to the first five wins but broke out the bats in the first two games against the Red Sox. Mark Trumbo homered in each of the first two games, Chris Davis bashed the tiebreaking three-run homer in the ninth inning on Monday and J.J.

Hardy hit a pair of home runs and drove in five to lead the O\xe2\x80\x99s to a 9-5 win over the Boston Red Sox.The unique feature of Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s two homers is that they both were short shots near the famous right-field line Pesky Pole at Fenway Park. Mark Trumbo added a monster shot above the green monster, showing that there are multiple ways to hit home runs.When asked on the O\xe2\x80\x99s radio broadcast after the game as to how he managed to do it twice, Hardy replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I even did it once!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He was laughing about it, but admitted that both balls would likely not be hits anywhere else, and that they were likely aided by the wind. The first homer hit off the top of the short wall and would have to be almost the shortest homer imaginable.In that same postgame interview, Hardy commented that not only was he being teased about it by teammates, but an umpire also chimed in, telling him, \xe2\x80\x9cI see you got smarter today.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 This in reference to the shot that Hardy did hit on Monday off the top of the wall in deep left-center field.J.J. has not historically had a great deal of success at Fenway. Coming into the game, having played 41 times in Boston\xe2\x80\x99s storied stadium, Hardy was hitting just .205 with four home runs. He now has equaled the Fenway career homers total of the namesake of the pole. Johnny Pesky, Boston infielder in the 1940s, only hit six total homers there (and just 17 over his total slap-hitting career. And the story of him curving one around the pole may well be more apocryphal than real.But Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s two two-run homers and sac-fly RBI were real and gave him five runs batted in for the evening, leading the Orioles to another win in their improbable 7-0 start on the young season.The Orioles are getting away with starters not going deep into games, as again they received only five innings from Mike Wright. Of course it was 15 days between appearances for him, and five innings is all you could hope for. Dylan Bundy gave the Birds 2.1 good innings to follow.Surely Buck Showalter wanted to get through a game without having to go to Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day or Zach Britton. The hope was for T.J. McFarland to finish off the final five outs. He got four before O\xe2\x80\x99Day had to be called upon for the final out.

So it is good to see Bundy doing this. Of course McFarland has made this his calling card. Currently with Wright and Vance Worley as starters, there is also Tyler Wilson who can go several innings. Mychal Givens can be called upn for more than three outs, and O\xe2\x80\x99Day as well has done this.So the Orioles can keep this up for a while, though two or three short starts in a row could create a problem really fast.

The starters have been decent, though only once has one gone more than five innings. But hey, to quote the experts, it\xe2\x80\x99s early in the long season.Here are a few examples of what some writers are thinking and saying \xe2\x80\xa6Jerry Crasnick \xe2\x80\x93 ESPN \xe2\x80\x93 Reflecting on the incredible home run depth the Orioles have, along with their historic strikeout abilities, he quipped that \xe2\x80\xa6Short of luring Adam Dunn out of retirement, the Orioles couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done more to assemble a more high-stakes, hit-or-miss lineup.After the first several games, Crasnick made reference to the long ball fireworks, while also commenting that this is a team that could set both home run and strikeout records (as we are following that also here on The Baltimore Wire). And then, after the seven consecutive wins, he shared this tweet \xe2\x80\xa6My brother-in-law Brian, the emperor of Baltimore, has thanked me for picking #Orioles last and graciously offered me lodging in October.\xe2\x80\x94 Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) April 13, 2016Eddie Matz \xe2\x80\x93 ESPN \xe2\x80\x93 This writer certainly pulls in an Orioles fan with his headline, \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time to start believing in the Baltimore Orioles.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But does he believe?Believe might be a strong word, but he is impressed. And after noting that the Kansas City Royals started off 2015 winning seven straight, Matz also said of the Orioles\xe2\x80\xa6They\xe2\x80\x99ve faced both Chris Archer and Price \xe2\x80\x94 the two best starters the AL East has to offer \xe2\x80\x94 and slapped them around like pi\xc3\xb1atas, tallying a combined five dingers and 11 runs in just 10 innings.The writer lists five reasons the Orioles have begun the season well: surprising starters, dish discipline, fine fielding, Manny being Manny, and strength of schedule (actually, weakness thereof is what he means).Jonah Keri \xe2\x80\x93 CBS Sports \xe2\x80\x93 This very creative writer also begins an article by seeking to explain this early success by highlighting the strengths that are known and anticipated from the Orioles: the power lineup and the solid bullpen. He writes of this as the mark of the Buck Showalter teams in Baltimore, who \xe2\x80\x9chold opponents close in the late innings, and pummel them with homers.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it is correct to say that this is the preferred strategy of Showalter, but it is what the composition of the personnel presents as a way to win.Keri notes that nobody expected the Orioles to do as well as they have done in recent years, particularly to win in 2014. He links to this preseason\xe2\x80\x99s predictions by their staff of five MLB writers (including himself), all of whom call for the Oriole to finish last in the AL East.

Mark Trumbo has fit right in with the free-swinging Baltimore Orioles, going deep twice on Friday to increase his home run total to five in his last five contests. The offseason acquisition looks to continue his impressive power display on Saturday as the visiting Orioles play the third contest of their four-game series versus the Texas Rangers. Trumbo launched a two-run blast in the seventh and capped the nine-run inning with a three-run shot as Baltimore snapped a modest two-game overall skid and five-game losing streak against Texas with an 11-5 triumph on Friday. The 30-year-old has collected 11 RBIs in his last five contests and gone deep among a 4-for-16 stretch against Saturday starter Colby Lewis. Texas, which had won five of seven before getting trampled by Trumbo, will be playing its 13th contest of 14 in 14 consecutive days to start the season on Saturday. Veteran Adrian Beltre reportedly agreed to a two-year contract extension worth $36 million on Friday but saw his hitting streak snapped at seven games heading into Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s tilt versus former Ranger Yovani Gallardo. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Yovani Gallardo (1-0, 5.40 ERA) vs. Rangers RH Colby Lewis (1-0, 3.00) Gallardo posted a 13-11 record and 3.42 ERA in his lone campaign with Texas before signing a two-year, $22 million deal with Baltimore in the offseason. The 30-year-old Mexican enjoyed success in Arlington as well, winning eight of his 14 decisions to help the Rangers reel in a playoff berth. Gallardo was fortunate to walk away with a no-decision on Monday after allowing five runs and seven hits in five innings against Boston. Lewis picked up his first win of the season on Monday after permitting one run and four hits in six innings of a 7-3 victory over Seattle. The 36-year-old managed to post a win in his last meeting with the Orioles despite yielding five runs and six hits in as many frames, improving his career mark versus the club to 2-4 with a gaudy 6.11 ERA. Lewis has struggled with J.J. Hardy, who enters Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s contest with a five-game hitting streak and is 6-for-18 (.333) with two homers versus the hurler. WALK-OFFS 1. Texas CF Delino DeShields is 8-for-17 with one homer, three RBIs and four runs scored in his last four games. 2.

Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles outfielder and designated hitter Mark Trumbo is off to a fantastic start. What are the chances this can continue?The Orioles secured Trumbo in the offseason in a trade with the Seattle Mariners involving Steve Clevenger. Of course this was not a one-to-one salary swap, since Trumbo makes multiple times more than the Baltimore native. But most fans also probably think that Mark is much older, when actually it is only by three months; both are currently age 30.A unique circumstance related to these thoughts on Trumbo is that while I\xe2\x80\x99m writing this, I am watching the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Friday night game against the Rangers. And what does he do but hit two home runs in one inning!\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is a great start.Where can this go? Could this be the second coming of Nelson Cruz, vintage 2014?\xc2\xa0 There would be justice in that! Especially since Seattle is where Cruz migrated after his great single season in Baltimore. The Orioles sure have savaged the Mariners in trades over the years!\xc2\xa0 (By the way, Nelson Cruz is currently hitting .256 through 10 games with 2 homers, and Clevenger in 0-for-7.)At a minimum, most Orioles followers have known all along that this was a good acquisition for the Birds, especially in advance of knowing for sure in the offseason as to what would come of the Chris Davis negotiations.But there really is a very good chance that Trumbo is going to prove to be an outstanding addition to the team. It may not be that he will lead the American League in home runs in 2016. But there is no doubt that he is going to hit a bunch of them, helped by Camden Yards. But we have seen that Trumbo has no inability to drive them out of any ballpark (five on the road already) \xe2\x80\xa6 anywhere between the foul poles.Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s best HR/RBI season was 2013, hitting 34 long balls and knocking in 100 runs. Last year it was 22/64 in 142 games. His career batting average is .252.It is not surprising that Trumbo can be a streaky hitter. In the months of April and May over his career he is a .283 hitter. In June and July it is .235; and in August and September the average is .240.\xc2\xa0 His worst single month is June at .216.Dividing seasons in halves, Trumbo is .262 in the first half and .242 in the second half. Additionally, his best statistics are when playing right field, batting .285. As a DH it is but .243.Now with five home runs in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first 10 games, he is hitting .400 with 11 RBIs. Last year he did not hit his fifth home run until May 12th, and did not get his 11th RBI until April 29th.

McFarland (0-1) took the loss after retiring only one of the four batters he faced in relief of Gallardo.The Orioles got solo home runs from Manny Machado, Adam Jones and Chris Davis to increase their major league lead to 23.Orioles right fielder Mark Trumbo overran Odor\'s two-run single, allowing Odor to reach third and score the final run on a single by Elvis Andrus.The Texas rally included a grounder hit by Nomar Mazara toward the hole between first and second. First baseman Davis fielded the ball, but neither he nor the left-handed McFarland could reach the bag in time.""I was late getting over,"" McFarland said.""Mac, his delivery makes him tardy over there a lot,"" Showalter said.Machado\'s first-inning homer into the Baltimore bullpen in left-center gave him hits in all 11 Orioles games this season.Machado also made two outstanding fielding plays on balls hit by Andrus. In the fourth, he dived toward the foul line to stop a ball and made a strong throw for the out. In the sixth, he started an inning-ending double play.Jones\' shot landed behind Baltimore\'s bullpen and was measured at 460 feet, the longest of his 197 big-league homers.Davis\' homer was his fifth of the season and tied him for the league lead with Trumbo, Seattle\'s Robinson Cano and Toronto\'s Josh Donaldson. That gave Baltimore eight homers in a span of eight innings.TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: RHP Kevin Gausman (shoulder) will have a work day on Sunday that will determine the next step in his rehab. LHP Brian Matusz (back strain) might rejoin the team next weekend.Rangers: LF Josh Hamilton (knee) will begin a rehab stint next weekend in Arizona with the goal of getting him about 35 at-bats before his scheduled return in mid-May.UP NEXTOrioles: RHP Mike Wright (1-0) allowed four earned runs in five innings at Boston in his only previous start. The Orioles scored three runs after he left to give him the win.Rangers: LHP Derek Holland (1-0) blanked the Mariners over 6 2/3 innings on Tuesday to get the win, giving up only four singles.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The problem of course was that first off those three homers were all solo shots \xe2\x80\x93 as they say,\xc2\xa0solo home runs generally don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you. But the Orioles also left nine runners on base last night. That can be a killer.Courtesy of Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY SportsWhile this isn\xe2\x80\x99t always true (it certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on Friday night), sometimes you need more than just homers to win games. Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily buy into the philosophy that some seem to be saying which is that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how many homers they hit, they can\xe2\x80\x99t pitch. Gallardo actually pitched fairly well last night \xe2\x80\x93 he was just left in a little too long. Gallardo\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.0 IP, 9 H, 4 R, 2 BB, 2 K.It might be fair to question why he was sent back out in the seventh, which is when Texas took control of the game. Keep in mind however that hindsight is always 20/20. Showalter would have only sent him back out using sound baseball reasoning \xe2\x80\x93 not just because, in other words. There could have been a matchup coming up that he liked, or something along those lines. Point being however, let\xe2\x80\x99s not judge the decision based on the result.\xc2\xa0Live Feed yovani gallardoMLB FanDuel: Daily Pitching Focus May 5 Fantasy CPRWhat We Learned: Mariners Fall to 2-8 after Series Loss to Houston SoDo MojoSodo Mojo's In-Game Mariners Twitter Poll: Yovani Gallardo Runs Allowed SoDo MojoSeattle Mariners Enemy: Houston Astros George Springer SoDo MojoMariners Second Series vs. Los Angeles Angels: 3 Up, 3 Down SoDo MojoMariners Vs.

Beltre grounded into a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice-RBI in the fifth, and Mazara added an RBI-single in the seventh to bring Texas to within one.

Odor would score on Andrus\xe2\x80\x99 RBI-single, and Texas won it 8-4. T.J. McFarland took the loss and recorded a blown save, and you have to wonder if he might be one of the candidates to go down when the litany of roster moves occur in the near future. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that because of this specific game, but due to the fact that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played much overall, and he has an option.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerAt the end of the day, as I said sometimes you need a bit more than the long ball to win games.

That honor has been passed to the Blue Jays.The Jays made the playoffs last year for the first time since 1993. As a baseball fan, it was great to see a team that struggled for so long \xe2\x80\x93 we know how that feels in Baltimore \xe2\x80\x93 finally get back into the postseason.Toronto shook the baseball world when Jose Bautista hit a monstrous three-run bomb in Game 5 of the American League Divisional Series last season. The homer moved the Blue Jays into the AL Championship Series, but that was not the focus of many people in baseball. It was Bautista\xe2\x80\x99s bat flip to celebrate that home run drew a lot of criticism. Furthermore, there was an incident in which the Toronto fans threw debris on to the field after a questionable call.That made fans all around the country feel some type of way. Either you loved it or hated it. Toronto made themselves an enemy throughout the MLB because of it.Do not tell that to Baltimore Orioles fans, however. They already despised the Jays before the infamous bat flip.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoThe national media made a big deal about the bat flip in the playoffs, but the Orioles saw the same act twice last season. Bautista hit a homer against Jason Garcia and made sure to throw his bat and chirp as he rounded the bases. That prompted an exchange between Bautista and Adam Jones.In that same game, Bautista had another bat flip that was not unnoticed by national media, but not the Orioles. What made this bat flip more disgusting was that it came after a walk, not a home run.Bautista and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day have some history between them. Mike Wright, the pitcher for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game, grazed Bautista\xe2\x80\x99s jersey with an inside pitch last season. The Jays responded by plunking Jones later in the game. Both pitches were attempts to get the batter off the plate, but did not sit well with either team.The Jays came to Camden Yards last September to win the AL East, a year after the O\xe2\x80\x99s took the crown. While it\xe2\x80\x99s still early in the season, the O\xe2\x80\x99s currently sit atop the AL East with the Jays just a few games behind. That\xc2\xa0adds\xc2\xa0some fuel to the fire for\xc2\xa0this series.Last season, my colleague Randy Buchman wrote a piece on how the Jays have become Enemy No. 1 for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. He reminded us of the bad blood between Manny Machado and Josh Donaldson, the Jays attempt to pry Dan Duquette away from Baltimore and Toronto spending money as if they were the Yanks or Sox. There are\xc2\xa0plenty of reasons for these two teams to have a sense of hatred for each other.The rivalry between the Orioles and Blue Jays is becoming one of the better ones in baseball, and there are sure to be fireworks at some point during this three-game series.Next: Will the Real Orioles Please Stand Up?As a fan of the game, I would rather see a great series between two teams with some serious power in their lineups as opposed to another battle of words.

The Baltimore Orioles have cooled since their historic start with losses in three of the last four games. The Orioles will have had two full days off to get their momentum changed when the host the Toronto Blue Jays in the opener of a three-game series on Tuesday. Baltimore won seven straight to open the season \xe2\x80\x93 its best start since moving from St. Louis following the 1953 season \xe2\x80\x93 but dropped three of the next four before Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s finale at Texas was postponed. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching staff was strong the first time through the rotation but started to show some cracks on the second turn while surrendering an average of 5.8 runs in the last six games. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s slugging lineup is matched by few teams in the majors but the Blue Jays happen to be one of those few with Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion and Troy Tulowitzki in the middle of the order. Tulowitzki drove in a run and Donaldson and Bautista each scored during a four-run rally in the eighth inning on Monday that earned Toronto a 4-3 win and a split of the four-game series at Boston. PITCHING MATCHUP: Blue Jays RH Marcus Stroman (2-0, 4.22 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Mike Wright (1-0, 7.20) Stroman sandwiched two quality starts around one dud in his three outings and limited the New York Yankees to two runs on three hits and two walks in eight innings to earn a win on Thursday. The Duke product went eight frames on opening day as well but was knocked around for five runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings without factoring in the decision against Boston on April 8. Stroman faced Baltimore on Sept. 30 last season and scattered one run and five hits over eight innings while striking out eight to pick up a win. Wright was skipped the first time through the rotation but will avoid another skip despite the rainout on Sunday, with the Orioles electing to push everyone back a day instead. Wright was knocked around for four runs on five hits and a walk in five innings at Boston in his first start on April 12 but got enough support from the offense to come out of it with a win. The 26-year-old was knocked around by Toronto during his 2015 rookie campaign, going 0-2 with a 9.45 ERA in three appearances \xe2\x80\x93 two starts. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles DH Pedro Alvarez is 4-for-24 with one extra-base hit on the season. 2. Toronto CF Kevin Pillar is 6-for-7 in two games since being dropped from the leadoff spot in the order. 3.

""It\'s always important to have different ways to do it.""The Orioles scored three runs in the first inning, then waited until the 10th to strike again. After Joseph doubled off rookie Joe Biagini (0-1), Joey Rickard got an infield hit and Manny Machado walked.With Adam Jones at the plate, a slider from Biagini got past Josh Thole and Joseph sprinted home.""I just missed the ball,"" Thole said.

The right-hander allowed the leadoff hitter to reach in each inning but limited Toronto to a 1-for-7 performance with runners in scoring position.""I guess I found the pitches that I need,"" Jimenez said. ""I executed when I needed, when I was in those situations with a runner on base. I was able to get back and throw a split for a strike, or a breaking ball or a fastball in to a lefty.""Toronto knuckleballer R.A.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsFormer Baltimore Orioles pitcher Milt Pappas has died at age 76.Older Orioles fans will certainly remember Milt Pappas for his time in Baltimore. And many who are younger and have heard of him will probably remember the name more for his involvement in a trade than for what he did on the field.Pappas was the principle player in the trade 50 years ago to get Frank Robinson from Cincinnati. It is oft remembered as a lop-sided deal in regard to the incredible Hall of Fame caliber of successes that Robinson had in the golden years of O\xe2\x80\x99s history. But lost in this narrative is the fact that he was a rather good pitcher.Coming up with the Orioles, he had a nine-year record in Baltimore of 110-74 and an ERA of 3.24.\xc2\xa0 What would the O\xe2\x80\x99s give to have a starter right now with numbers like that!After the trade he pitched the rest of his career in the National League for the Reds, Braves and Cubs. Combined he was 99-90 with a 3.57 ERA.There are two seasons in his career that particularly stand out. The first of these was his final year with the Orioles where he was an All-Star and went 13-9 on a 2.60 ERA and WHIP of 1.102.\xc2\xa0 This helps to explain the trade \xe2\x80\xa6 at least a little bit.The other great season was his next-to-last campaign in 1972. His final record for the Cubs was 17-7 with an ERA of 2.77 and WHIP of 1.108.\xc2\xa0 A unique event in September of this season came against the Padres, pitching a perfect game to 26 batters before walking the 27th on a controversial 3-2 call. He did record the no-hitter but never forgave the ump.But the thing that I will always remember about Milt Pappas is that he was the starting pitcher for the Orioles on the occasion of the first time I ever attended a major league game. It was May 2nd, 1964 against the Indians. This was game #12 of the season for the Birds, just as last evening\xe2\x80\x99s was for this version of the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Pappas was already starting his fourth game of the season dating back to opening day.I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall the circumstances, but Pappas only pitched 2.2 innings that day before being lifted after giving up two runs on five hits and a walk. He then also missed his next turn in the rotation. The Orioles would go on with a 2-2 tie, giving up a run in the 12th, but also scoring a third run \xe2\x80\xa6 only to lose 6-4 by being outscored 3-1 in the 13th frame.

Ranks are based on rolling past 20 games overall, early in the season, this date range reaches back to regular-season games of the previous year. You look at the baseball standings, see the Red Sox at the bottom of the AL East and the Orioles at the top, and automatically decide to bet on Baltimore.

04/21/2016,"[('Thursday Bird Droppings: Looking ahead to the Orioles ...', ' Hello, friends. After an unlikely victory over the Blue Jays last night, the Orioles sit at 9-4 on the season. They\'ve now got a 2.5 game advantage over their two closest competitors, the Red Sox and the Blue Jays. If you missed the 4-3 victory in the first extra innings game the O\'s played this season, or if you just want to re-live the highs and lows,\xc2\xa0check out Stacey\'s recap here.    One of the durable, if dubious, narratives from the mainstream O\'s media last season was that Chris Tillman struggled a lot against the Blue Jays. This was generally deployed as an excuse - like, oh, Tillman\'s near-5.00 ERA isn\'t THAT bad once you take out his 11.72 ERA in six starts against the Blue Jays. And indeed, it wasn\'t; against all other teams he had a 3.84 ERA. Not great, but not awful. But what good is it if you\'re completely terrible against a division opponent you will probably face more than any other team? Anyway, we might get the truest test of whether Tillman is going to do any better this year compared to last year based on how he performs tonight in the rubber match against the Jays. The O\'s could really stand to have him defy that trend. Let\'s hit the links. Around the blogO\'sphere ""Doctor"" Paul Eicholtz, Known For Orioles Br | WBAL Radio 1090 AMThe extended Orioles family lost a long-time member as former O\'s radio producer/engineer Paul Eicholtz passed away recently. Joe Angel and Fred Manfra first started messing with him and this continues on to the present day whenever they bring up the current producer, ""Tiny"" Tim Jones.    Steve Melewski: Did Wright take a step forward last night? (Plus Schoop on the power)From yesterday on MASN. If logging a bare minimum quality start (six innings, three earned runs) is taking a step forward, I guess that\'s good... but then again it\'s also bad.    School of Roch: Updating Matusz, Gausman, Jones, Lohse and more Matusz is coming. Are you prepared? Brian Matusz\'s pending return could signal changes in Orioles bullpen construction, usage - Baltimore SunIt looks like the people who really ought to be prepared are the O\'s long relievers with minor league options. Gotta figure T.J. McFarland is going to head to the minors when Matusz is activated, which is expected to happen on Saturday.    Orioles notebook: Joey Rickard adjusting to leadoff role - Baltimore SunNo early season Orioles discussion is complete without mention of Rule 5 sensation Joey Rickard, who added three hits to his tally in Wednesday\'s game. Birthdays and anniversaries Former Orioles with birthdays today include one of the many 2011 middle infielders, Ryan Adams, 2012 short-timer Ronny Paulino, LOOGY prototype Jesse Orosco (1995-99 teams), and Al Bumbry, who was here from 1972-84 and never played on a losing team.

On this day in history... In 753 BC, according to tradition, the city of Rome was founded by Romulus. In 1509 AD, Henry VIII ascended to the throne of England. Other than his six marriages, he\'s also the man who presided over the union of England and Wales. In 1835, the Battle of San Jacinto, which was the decisive battle of the Texas revolution, was waged. Sam Houston\'s force defeated Santa Anna\'s Mexicans in 18 minutes. In 1918, during World War I, Germany\'s fighter ace Manfred von Richthofen, better known to history as The Red Baron, was shot down and killed over France. The Red Baron himself shot down 80 aircraft. Canadian RAF Captain Arthur Roy Brown is credited with the victory, though it\'s now believed ground fire struck Richthofen in the cockpit. In 1992, astronomers Alexander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the first discovery of extrasolar planets - that is, any planet not orbiting our Sun. By the present day, there have been 2,108 confirmed exoplanets located.

The Orioles desperately needed a number one hitter. A guy who could get on-base and set the table for guys like Manny Machado, Adam Jones, Chris Davis, and Mark Trumbo. So far, so good.No, Rickard is not Alex Gordon or Fowler in the outfield, although metrics don\xe2\x80\x99t count for everything. By the way, if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it, Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s catch Thursday against Justin Upton and Detroit was fabulous.Rickard has been a great acquisition for the Birds, and while he likely won\xe2\x80\x99t hit .350 all year, he also is by far the youngest of the five players on this list.Next: Monkeys Running Down Eutaw StreetAnother shrewd, and so far successful move by Dan Duquette.Speaking of Gordon and the Kansas City Royals, the Orioles are taking on the World Series Champs starting Friday night.

Two American League division leaders face off when the Baltimore Orioles visit the Kansas City Royals on Friday to begin a three-game series. Baltimore leads the AL East at 10-4 after winning its last two against Toronto as Manny Machado extended his hitting streak to 14 contests while the Royals are 6-2 at home on the way to a one half-game lead in the AL Central. Machado is one of three Orioles (Brian Roberts and Eddie Murray) to start a season by hitting safely in 14 straight games and can set a new career high on Friday. Baltimore will send Yovani Gallardo to the mound to try and improve on the team\xe2\x80\x99s 3-3 record on the road. Kansas City (10-5), which won four of seven against the Orioles last season, took two of three versus Detroit earlier this week. Eric Hosmer has recorded at least one hit in 11 consecutive games for the Royals and reached base in 23 straight regular-season contests, dating back to the 2015. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Yovani Gallardo (1-0, 5.63 ERA) vs. Royals RH Chris Young (0-3, 7.90) Gallardo has given up nine runs over 11 innings in his last two starts after producing a solid performance in his season debut. The 30-year-old Mexican, who signed as a free agent in the offseason, has walked six and struck out nine in three outings with his new team. Omar Infante (1-for-12) has struggled against Gallardo, who has been dominant in two career starts versus Kansas City (1-0, 1.93 ERA). Young is coming off one of his best seasons (11-6) but has not carried over that performance, permitting 12 runs over 13 2/3 innings in his first three starts of 2016. The 36-year-old Texan had his best outing at home, allowing two runs and three hits over five frames. J.J. Hardy is 0-for-9 with three strikeouts versus Young, who is 2-1 with a 3.52 ERA in five career appearances (four starts) against Baltimore. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles RHP Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day has not allowed a run in eight outings (7 1/3 innings) this season and Baltimore is 8-0 in games he has pitched. 2. Royals 3B Mike Moustakas is 6-for-16 with a pair of homers during his four-game hitting streak. 3. Baltimore rookie LF Joey Rickard has reached base in his first 14 major-league games, recording at least one hit in 13 of them.

""It\'s just one of those things.  For some reason the bullpen just didn\'t feel right.  I just wasn\'t able to extend to get that release point.""The ball was just up and just all over the place. Just feel like the ball was coming out of my hand, like the strength wasn\'t there. Hopefully it\'s nothing serious.""Gallardo, signed to a two-year, $22 million deal in February, will return to Baltimore on Saturday to have his shoulder examined and to determine the extent of the injury.""The previous starts in the spring and the previous starts I had during the season, I tried to go out there and hopefully it went away, but as the game went on it just kept getting a little bit worse and worse, each and every pitch that I made,"" Gallardo said. ""It stinks.  I\'ll just stay positive and hopefully it\'s nothing serious.""Gallardo (1-1) yielded four runs and five hits. It was Gallardo\'s shortest outing since April 27, 2012, at St. Louis, when he allowed eight runs on eight hits and two walks.Manager Buck Showalter said Gallardo\'s velocity has decreased ""a tick.""""I\'ve looked at all his velocities and averages in his starts through April, May, June, and he\'s down,"" Showalter said.Chris Young struck out 10 in six innings and Mike Moustakas homered, doubled twice and drove in three runs to lead the Royals.Young (1-3), who came in with a 7.90 ERA and had allowed 20 hits in 13 2/3 innings, baffled the Orioles.""Certainly the last two games, I struggled a little bit,"" Young said. ""After the game in Oakland, Ned (Yost, Royals manager) called me in the office and said, \'I think you are so close to clicking and getting on a roll.\' For him to show that confidence shows more than I can really articulate.""Young recorded his sixth career double-figure strikeout game and his first since April 24, 2008, when he struck out 10 against San Francisco while with San Diego.Young gave up two runs and four hits, including a sixth inning leadoff home run to Manny Machado, who extended his hitting streak to a career-high 15 games.Wade Davis pitched a spotless ninth to log his seventh save in as many chances.Moustakas hit his sixth home run on Gallardo\'s second pitch with Alcides Escobar aboard. Moustakas had a two-out, RBI double in the second off Gallardo.MAKE-UP DATEThe Orioles\' rainout Sunday at Texas has been rescheduled for June 20, which will interrupt a scheduled eight-game Camden Yards homestand. ""Without a doubt, it\'s unfortunate,"" Showalter said. ""That\'s why you try to play the game or you know you\'ll have to play it twice. You see so much stress on players and it seems to get worse every year with physical, emotion, mental challenges.

Morales would add an RBI-double, and an inning later Moustakas would add on another run with an RBI-double of his own.

To be honest, it was one of those feelings that I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had my whole career. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had any issues with my shoulder and I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been.

Hopefully, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything serious. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to Baltimore tomorrow to see a doctor and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go from there.And here\xe2\x80\x99s a spot where you have to give Gallardo a bit of credit. Over the past few seasons we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen various Orioles know that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t feeling right, but they\xe2\x80\x99d neglect to tell Buck Showalter about it in hopes that it would go away or something like that. And in a way I understand that mentality. Certainly if it was something serious they would have to say something, however at the end of the day guys don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose their jobs by not being able to play.But being a veteran, Gallardo knew that he was brought to Baltimore to help get the Birds back to the \xe2\x80\x9cpromised land.\xe2\x80\x9d And him not feeling right wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to serve him well, nor would it have served the team.

Mandatory Credit: Peter G. Aiken-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles used a solid, total team effort on Saturday evening for a great victory over the Kansas City Royals, 8-3.There was a lot to like about the game the O\xe2\x80\x99s put together, with a number of highlights that bode well for certain players as we move forward. More on that in a moment.But first, empty your mind of this game and just consider this \xe2\x80\xa6 There is a Baseball game between the Royals and another squad. The winning team features a decent start with a four-inning shut-down bullpen, solid outfield defense and hustle, 14 hits slapped here and there with bloops falling in and runners circling the bases, and a 5-for-10 with runners in scoring position. Who is the winning team?Anyone who is knowledgeable about the current state of affairs in major league baseball would say that surely that scenario pictured a classic Royals-styled victory. But on this Saturday evening it was the Orioles who turned the tables on Kansas City. So thorough was the flip that Adam Jones walked three times in the game! If you did not know that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll pause while you pick yourself off the floor.Jones also ran down two balls in center field that most outfielders don\xe2\x80\x99t catch up to. In the same game, Alex Gordon and Lorenzo Cain misplayed two balls into doubles for Orioles hitters. And that was just a sample of a Royals team that was out of position and perfunctorily going through the motions. It was very, very strange.We\xe2\x80\x99re talking here about the Alex Gordon that was so desired as a corner outfielder to seek to acquire over this past offseason. The same player who went 1-for-3 to raise his batting average to .224, while the Orioles have a rookie named Joey Rickard who is hitting .319.\xc2\xa0 And to be honest, Rickard was not in left field; some other guy with the last name of \xe2\x80\x9cKim\xe2\x80\x9d played there and went 2-for-4.Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a long season and we\xe2\x80\x99re only 10% complete at 11-5. But we can list some observations that bring true encouragement.Tyler Wilson had a respectable start, even though he yielded three runs in five innings. He has good stuff that will play well with more experience. The Gallardo injury could be more fortuitous for the Orioles than it may at first appear.Though Brian Matusz only retired one of the three batters he faced in his first outing of the season, he was severely pinched by the plate umpire. Beyond that, his stuff looked very crisp with great movement.Mychal Givens pitched out of a terribly hairy situation, getting two critical outs with the bases loaded. This has to be a character builder for the young pitcher.Brad Brach was totally filthy with his stuff. He came on in the ninth and threw nine consecutive strikes for two strikeouts and a chopper back to the mound. It was such an aggressive way to approach that situation. Brach\xe2\x80\x99s change-up had unbelievable movement, followed by a 96 mph fastball. Nasty.Chris Davis stroked four hits, including a massive shot for the only homer of the game. All of the taking of pitches he has been doing that does yield many walks and a high OBP has the additional benefit now of making the pitcher come to him a bit more.

The Mets reached the last World Series with a group of young, hard-throwing, right-handed starters who have yet to reach free agency. If the Indians get there this fall, it will be for the same reason.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be around our starting pitching,\xe2\x80\x9d General Manager Mike Chernoff said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think when you look at the success the Mets had last year, you can see that that can be successful. You read the fans\xe2\x80\x99 reaction or the media\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to \xe2\x80\x98Do you have to trade a starter to balance your team more?\xe2\x80\x99 What we saw last year with the Mets was no, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do that.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Indians\xe2\x80\x99 rotation pillars are Corey Kluber, Carlos Carrasco and Danny Salazar. Last season, they combined for 10 strikeouts per nine innings, with a 3.52 E.R.A. The Mets\xe2\x80\x99 top three \xe2\x80\x94 Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard \xe2\x80\x94 combined for 9.49 strikeouts per nine innings, with a 2.80 E.R.A.Chernoff, 34, is more familiar with the Mets than most. He started his career in baseball as an intern for the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 baseball operations department when analytics was in its infancy.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cI was transcribing the numbers from the Super Register into an Excel database so we could analyze them,\xe2\x80\x9d Chernoff said, referring to an annual Baseball America reference book. \xe2\x80\x9cI was staying up every night until 4 in the morning doing that. It\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassing to think about it now, but that was the state of analytics in 2002. There was no Fangraphs, there was no Baseball-Reference. There was none of that out there.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Chernoff is a Princeton graduate, like Mark Shapiro, the former Indians president, and Mike Hazen, a former Indians official who is now general manager of the Boston Red Sox. The Indians promoted Chernoff to general manager last October, when Chris Antonetti took over for Shapiro, who left for the Toronto Blue Jays.

Credit             Tony Dejak/Associated Press           \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the smartest human beings I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been around,\xe2\x80\x9d Shapiro said of Chernoff this spring. \xe2\x80\x9cGood human being, high-character individual, incredible intellect and ability to reason and understand where the opportunities are and where the leverage lies. The intellectual muscle and firepower that Mike has, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know many people who have that, combined with an elite level of integrity.\xe2\x80\x9dChernoff played baseball in college with the future major leaguers Ross Ohlendorf and Will Venable. In 102 games across four seasons at Princeton, Chernoff, a middle infielder, hit .242 with no homers. But he set an example for others, and served as a team captain as a senior.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cI would say his work ethic was great,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ohlendorf, who pitches for the Cincinnati Reds. \xe2\x80\x9cHe really worked hard, and he was a good leader. He made sure other guys were in the weight room and working out.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  With the Indians, Chernoff has helped build a team that won a wild card in 2013 and has had winning records in the two years since. Nobody on the Indians\xe2\x80\x99 current roster was brought in as a free agent on a multiyear deal (the departed Michael Bourn and Nick Swisher were expensive disappointments), but they have used every other source to find their core players.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The draft brought them second baseman Jason Kipnis, shortstop Francisco Lindor and closer Cody Allen. They signed Salazar as an amateur from the Dominican Republic. And when the Indians have traded veterans, they have usually gotten high-impact talent in return \xe2\x80\x94 C. C. Sabathia brought outfielder Michael Brantley; Cliff Lee brought Carrasco; Jake Westbrook brought Kluber; Casey Blake brought designated hitter Carlos Santana; and Esmil Rogers brought catcher Yan Gomes.\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to hit on everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Chernoff said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have the same margin for error that a large-market team has. We know who we are and how we have to make decisions like that, and they can be really hard in the moment.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a lot of backlash on some of those trades that we made, but at the same time, if you have a plan and you have an idea of how to build it, you see the fruits of those decisions four or five years later.\xe2\x80\x9d Photo       The Indians signed Danny Salazar, left, as an amateur from the Dominican Republic.  Credit             David Maxwell/Getty Images           As successful as their trades have been, the Indians \xe2\x80\x94 who won their last World Series title in 1948 \xe2\x80\x94 still have not played in a playoff series since 2007. They have finished last or second to last in the American League in attendance in each of the last four seasons, playing in the shadow of LeBron James\xe2\x80\x99s Cavaliers but also of the city\xe2\x80\x99s lowly N.F.L. team.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cPeople here love the Browns; they obviously have had tough times over the past decade or so, and yet there\xe2\x80\x99s always this kind of eternal optimism in football that you can get yourself out of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Chernoff said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can be challenging in a city like this where you have that, compared to us, where over the last three years we\xe2\x80\x99ve been relatively good but there\xe2\x80\x99s still some of that pent-up negativity. You have to recognize that really, it\xe2\x80\x99s just passionate people who want a championship for the city.\xe2\x80\x9dChernoff is quite familiar with intense fans. His father, Mark, is the vice president for programming at New York\xe2\x80\x99s WFAN. Chernoff is used to fans voicing their opinions, a pastime that followed him to Cleveland.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cFive years ago, my dad helped start one of the stations for CBS here,\xe2\x80\x9d Chernoff said, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cSo now they have sports-talk radio all day \xe2\x80\x94 just in time for me to be in this role. It\xe2\x80\x99s perfect. I can thank him for that.\xe2\x80\x9d Dominant Beyond a No-Hitter  When Jake Arrieta pitched another no-hitter on Thursday, for the Chicago Cubs in Cincinnati, it highlighted an overwhelming stretch of dominance.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In his last 19 regular-season starts, Arrieta is 16-1 with an 0.78 E.R.A. He has not allowed an earned run in 13 of those starts, and the only time he lost was when his opponent \xe2\x80\x94 Cole Hamels, then with Philadelphia \xe2\x80\x94 threw a no-hitter. Arrieta has also won the Cy Young Award, tossed a shutout in the National League wild-card game and no-hit the Los Angeles Dodgers in that span.As a Cub, he is 40-13 with a 2.17 E.R.A. With his previous team, the Baltimore Orioles, he was 20-25 with a 5.46 E.R.A. The Orioles \xe2\x80\x94 who discouraged Arrieta from throwing across his body, as he prefers \xe2\x80\x94 may always regret trading him in July 2013. But there is, at least, a smaller victory hidden within that deal.

But the Orioles \xe2\x80\x94 who also dealt Pedro Strop, a useful reliever \xe2\x80\x94 also acquired a backup catcher, Steve Clevenger, from the Cubs.

But last December, when the Seattle Mariners wanted to move an expensive outfielder to the Orioles, they accepted Clevenger in return.The outfielder: Mark Trumbo, who looks like a steal for the Orioles. Through Friday, Trumbo was hitting .362 with five homers, helping the Orioles to a surprising 10-5 start. Trumbo is not Arrieta, and this rate of production seems unlikely to last. But at least the Orioles have something to show for the ace who got away.

But that dry patch is short compared with the 1970s, when there were no perfect games at all.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The pitcher who came closest, Milt Pappas, died on Tuesday at age 76. Pitching for the Chicago Cubs on Sept. 2, 1972, Pappas lost a perfect game with two outs and two strikes in the ninth inning when the plate umpire, Bruce Froemming, called ball four to the San Diego pinch-hitter Larry Stahl.Though Pappas praised Froemming\xe2\x80\x99s strike zone immediately after that game, he later held that Froemming should have given him the final strike. But it was not Froemming\xe2\x80\x99s job to get caught up in the moment. In a 2010 interview with The New York Times, he maintained that the pitch was a ball.\xe2\x80\x9cThe pitch was outside,\xe2\x80\x9d Froemming said. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss the pitch; Pappas missed the pitch. You can look at the tape. Pappas, the next day, said, \xe2\x80\x98I know the pitch was outside, but you could have given it to me.\xe2\x80\x99 That pitch has gotten better over the years. That pitch is right down the middle now.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Pappas remains the only pitcher to issue a walk with two outs in the ninth inning and a perfect game on the line. But a similar situation arose last June, when Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Max Scherzer needed one more strike against Pittsburgh\xe2\x80\x99s Jose Tabata to finish off a perfect game. Scherzer hit Tabata with an errant slider, spoiling his bid \xe2\x80\x94 but, like Pappas, he retired the next batter and settled for a no-hitter.

04/25/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: A look back at civil unrest - Birds Watcher', 'It\xe2\x80\x99s almost fitting that the Baltimore Orioles find themselves in Tampa starting tonight. However unlike right around this time last year, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be the visiting team at Tropicana Field. The weekend which corresponds with this coming weekend (last year, that is) saw the O\xe2\x80\x99s hosting Tampa. However due to circumstances beyond anyone\xe2\x80\x99s control, that series was moved to Tampa \xe2\x80\x93 with the O\xe2\x80\x99s as the home team\xe2\x80\xa6on the road.We all remember what happened, and it was all covered ad hoc on this site. One year ago today, the Orioles were hosting the Boston Red Sox at Oriole Park, in a game that became marred by the civil unrest which was occurring around the city and around the ballpark before and during the game. One of the windows in Dempsey\xe2\x80\x99s Brew Pub was broken, numerous cars were vandalized, and even some fans attending the game were intimidated by protesters.This of course was only the first act in a week-long saga surrounding the death of Freddie Gray at the hands of the Baltimore City Police. April 27th brought an evenCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsworse situation, with full blown riots brewing citywide, prompting the cancellation of that evening\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 game vs. Chicago. The next evening\xe2\x80\x99s game was canceled as well, and the scheduled game on April 29th was moved to a matinee\xe2\x80\xa6in front of an empty Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

It showed the determination of the city of Baltimore, which I know has always been there. We saw it in 1814 when the city withstood the British bombardment with the defense of Fort McHenry, prompting Francis Scott Key to write what we later called our national anthem. There\xe2\x80\x99s a certain defiance of circumstances which is truly Baltimorean. The Orioles are so much a part of the pysche of this city, and thus the people weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be kept from their team.I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to turn this into a political column, however the fact is that there were aspects on both sides of the situation that both fueled things and led to them. However there can be no doubt that those who aimed to do harm to the city and private property had no business doing what they did. It caused the city to look bad, and so many lives to be altered \xe2\x80\x93 in some cases permanently. Our society is not perfect, and perhaps if we accept that as opposed to constantly trying to change it we might do better than having incidents like these. In essence, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that humanity itself will never be perfect. We can try, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll constantly fall short.

However we also can\xe2\x80\x99t use those events to excuse or pardon the riots themselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s really that simple.The Orioles represented Baltimore to the nation and the world with an unbelievable amount of grace and understanding while all of this was going on. And when they finally returned home after a road trip, for the first time in history they wore home uniforms that said BALTIMORE as opposed to ORIOLES.

But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, in fact, it was a perfectly fair trade.It\xe2\x80\x99s a day that Orioles fans will be forced to relive frequently. July 2nd, 2013, the day that the Orioles traded pitchers Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop to the Chicago Cubs for pitcher Scott Feldman and catcher Steve Clevenger.At the time, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like that big of a trade. A struggling prospect who was near the end of being considered a prospect (Arrieta) and a good reliever (Strop) for a decent starting pitcher (Feldman) and a backup catcher (Clevenger). It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a blockbuster deal by any means, and it barely registered on the radar of anyone who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fan of either team, but it\xe2\x80\x99s ended up being known as one of the biggest trade blunders in Orioles, and probably baseball, history. And I\xe2\x80\x99m here to say that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be at all. The trade was a fair trade.It seems stupid to say that now, considering what Jake Arrieta has become. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s a Cy Young winner who\xe2\x80\x99s thrown two no-hitters. He threw an incredible 1.77 ERA last year, and has so far had a 0.80 ERA this year. The guy is putting up Clayton Kershaw numbers (minus a few strikeouts) and I think you could absolutely make the argument that he\xe2\x80\x99s the best pitcher in baseball.To understand this trade, and to understand why the trade made complete sense at the time, you have to understand what Arrieta was when he was with the Orioles, not what he became. At the time of the trade, Arrieta was 27 years old, and had already logged 358 innings in his career with a 5.46 ERA. His best year in the majors, he pitched 100.1 innings with a 4.66 ERA and only 4.66 K/9.Arrieta was part of a batch of young pitching prospects for the Orioles that was supposed to be an all-star rotation of the future. Along with Chris Tillman, Brian Matusz, and Zach Britton, Arrieta was supposed to be a future star. He had incredible stuff, everyone saw it, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t coming together. He was walking people left and right, he had no control and his stuff was eminently hittable. After five years of Arrieta, the Orioles were ready to cut bait and see if someone else wanted to take a chance on him.Apr 21, 2016; Cincinnati, OH, USA; Chicago Cubs starting pitcher Jake Arrieta (left) is congratulated by catcher David Ross (right) after Arrieta pitched a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park. The Cubs won 16-0. Mandatory Credit: David Kohl-USA TODAY SportsIn exchange they got Scott Feldman, who at the time was doing pretty well for the Cubs. Feldman was 30, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be an all-star, but with his 3.46 ERA at the time, and his .227 BAA, he was going to be one of the best pitchers on the Orioles, that\xe2\x80\x99s how badly the team needed a pitcher. The Orioles were vying for a playoff spot, they were just 2 \xc2\xbd games out of first place, and needed someone to sure up the rotation, and for that, they traded a seemingly lost prospect and a reliever. Even Feldman\xe2\x80\x99s teammate at the time, Jeff Samardzija, was upset that Feldman was leaving, saying he didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe Feldman\xe2\x80\x99s departure improved the team, and wondered why the guy had to go.Now, there seems to be more to this story, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the contentious part. As far as Arrieta is concerned, it\xe2\x80\x99s essentially the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching staff\xe2\x80\x99s fault that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t fulfill his potential in Baltimore. He believed that the Orioles were messing around with his delivery and his pitches, forbidding him from throwing a cut fastball and not letting him throw the way that felt natural to him. Once he got to the Cubs, the reins were off and he could do what he wanted, and he believes that\xe2\x80\x99s what got him to where he is now.oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dBaltimore Orioles reliever Brad Brach: From afterthought to starring roleMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton Injury Isn't So Devastating2d - MLB: Laz Diaz strikes again - But the pitch was outside, of course2d - Boston Red Sox Coming Down Hard on Racism2d - Baltimore Orioles Zach Britton Out Six to Eight Weeks4d - Are the Red Sox and Orioles baseball's new rivalry?More News at Birds Watcher  Former Orioles pitching coach Rick Adair claims that Arrieta was held back because he was recovering from injury, that he had a bone spur in 2011 and he was still getting his feel back. Arrieta doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to buy it, and claims that the coaching staff not only messed him up, but Tillman, Matusz, and Britton too. Tillman has developed into a decent starter for Baltimore, Britton into one of the best closers in baseball, and Matusz has fizzled out into a lefty-specialist, none of them developed into the aces they were supposed to, so it\xe2\x80\x99s only natural to be suspicious. In fact, considering the Orioles haven\xe2\x80\x99t had an ace starter in years (Erik Bedard maybe?), it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly reasonable to be suspicious of the coaching staff.Ultimately, we\xe2\x80\x99ll never truly know why Jake Arrieta couldn\xe2\x80\x99t develop into the ace that he is now while he was in Baltimore. Perhaps it was the coaching, perhaps it was his fault, perhaps it was injury, perhaps it was a mix of everything. But what I do know is that on the day of July 2nd, 2013, I saw that the Orioles had traded Arrieta away and I thought it was perfectly fair, and I still do.It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to hate the trade in retrospect, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to sit there and think back to the Orioles trading away Curt Schilling, Steve Finley, and Pete Harnisch for Glenn Davis and think this is just a repeat, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not. As an Orioles fan, do I get a little twinge every time I see Arrieta pitch? Sure. Does it suck seeing our pitching staff bomb into one of the worst staffs in baseball each year? Sure. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad trade, it\xe2\x80\x99s just baseball.

Mandatory Credit: Peter G. Aiken-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles starting rotation is a work in progress, as it may well be throughout the 2016 season.The big question mark in anticipation of this season surrounded starting pitching, and it continues to be the most uncertain element for this team. Miguel Gonzalez is gone and Kevin Gausman is yet to make his first start. Chris Tillman and Ubaldo Jimenez have been on schedule, but beyond that it has been a rotating rotation. Six different names have started already through the first 17 games.And now the late free agent acquisition, Yovani Gallardo, has been put on the disabled list for 15 days with tendinitis. At the time of his signing, there were a number of question marks both about his health and his declining metrics, particularly velocity.There is quite a chorus among O\xe2\x80\x99s fans and writers of \xe2\x80\x9cI told you so\xe2\x80\x9d comments and reflections on the Gallardo situation. Looking back to the winter signing and my own comments, I can be added to that list. I wrote on February 21 \xe2\x80\xa6I would not have done this deal. As written previously, I fear that this contributes negatively to the overall need for the Orioles to \xe2\x80\x9cgrow the arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Since Gallardo and Ubaldo are too expensive to not use, and Kevin Gausman is going to pitch regularly no matter what, for players like Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson to develop, some terrible things have to happen to Miguel Gonzalez or Chris Tillman.Well, getting released is something terrible, so Gonzo in gonzo. \xc2\xa0And now Tyler Wilson and Mike Wright have had opportunities to start, including the past two games in Kansas City. \xc2\xa0This is a good thing. As we\xe2\x80\x99ve written here multiple times, there is nothing more for these two players to prove at AAA. They need to now show they can do it for the Orioles, and having experiences like this past weekend is what will either affirm or deny their prospective talent.Were they great starts? Not really, but they were not bad at all. Though Wilson gave up three runs in five innings, he gave the Orioles the chance to win, and they did. Wright\xe2\x80\x99s start was actually a quality start, giving up two runs in six innings, before being sent out in the seventh where the game unraveled.It seemed odd that Buck sent Wright out for the seventh inning, having thrown 87 pitches. Presumably it was to save the bullpen. Showalter said ..\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a quality start for us. We had four guys we weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to use in the bullpen today. We needed that from Mike. We just didn\xe2\x80\x99t do much offensively.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles entered the game with the second-most innings pitched by the bullpen amongst American League teams, although the differences are not exceedingly great. As well, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had the second-best ERA at 1.62, just behind the White Sox at 1.60.\xc2\xa0 The third-best is over a run higher at 2.72 by the Mariners.

It was going to take a shutout on this day to beat Royals starter Yordano Ventura.But there is reason to be hopeful that Tyler Wilson and Mike Wright can develop into effective rotation pieces for the Orioles. They need the slots to gain that final bit of experience, and this weekend was a positive for the accomplishment of that goal.Now the Orioles move on to face the power hitting Tampa Bay Rays \xe2\x80\x94 the guys who hit five home runs against the Yankees on Sunday.

I have no reason to believe that this is going to be something that\xe2\x80\x99s permanent, however needless to say as of right now he\xe2\x80\x99s a Norfolk Tide. And the fact is that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be an asset to that roster.Courtesy of Mark L. Baer-USA TODAY SportsFlaherty of course was obtained in the 2011-12 Rule 5 draft from the Cubs. While he\xe2\x80\x99s been a utility player ever since, he was an instant fan favorite. He\xe2\x80\x99s only the first in a line of Rule 5 picks that the Orioles have managed to keep and who have produced.Obviously once a player has been on the roster for six months (basically an entire season), he\xe2\x80\x99s officially the property of that team. So unfortunately for Flaherty, this may have boiled down to the fact that he had options available. These decisions sometimes aren\xe2\x80\x99t fair or popular, but the team has to do what serves it\xe2\x80\x99s needs best.

', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Jake Arrieta and Zach Britton have an answer for why they ...', ' Every time that Jake Arrieta does something great for the Cubs, there\'s a new chance for the baseball media world to kick Orioles fans in the teeth. They frequently avail themselves of this opportunity when it presents itself. Arrieta\'s second no-hitter of his career in his most recent start proved to be another one of these opportunities. It surely won\'t be the last chance they get to do so.    Arrieta will forever be the one who got away to O\'s fans. Given the sad state of the Orioles starting rotation over the last couple of seasons and Arrieta\'s wild success in that time, it\'s hard not to look at him and wonder what might have been. Over his past three seasons, he\'s now posted a 1.99 ERA over 62 starts with a 0.898 WHIP. Arrieta threw four complete games last year; the Orioles combined for zero complete games last year. Even when you factor in the National League competition, it\'s nothing short of impressive, and a very long way from the 6.20 ERA he posted in his last full Orioles season. The answer to the cavalry problem The question is there even now: Why couldn\'t the cavalry succeed here? Out of the quartet of Arrieta, Zach Britton, Brian Matusz, and Chris Tillman, the Orioles ended up getting two and a half good seasons of starting pitching - all of those from Tillman. That\'s it.    The answer, or at least an answer, has come into clearer focus with a couple of recent articles. One of them you may have seen is an Arrieta profile from\xc2\xa0Sports Illustrated back in March.    The first paragraph of Tom Verducci\'s article likens Arrieta to quasi-mythical American frontier survivor Hugh Glass. The second paragraph draws a direct parallel between Arrieta and one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from Christian eschatology. In the third paragraph, we are told by Arrieta\'s wife that he is known simply as ""Beast."" Eventually, Verducci starts talking about actual baseball, and a culprit is fingered: former Orioles pitching coach Rick Adair, who served in that position from June 2011 to August 2013 - time in which Arrieta pitched a total of 37 games at the MLB level for the O\'s and pitched to an increasingly worse ERA each season. Regarding that time in his career, Arrieta told Verducci:     There were so many things in Baltimore not many people know about. I had struggles with my pitching coach. A lot of guys did. Three or four guys - Tillman, Matusz, [Zach] Britton - were just really uncomfortable in their own skins at the time, trying to be the guys they weren\'t. You can attest how difficult it is to try to reinvent your mechanics against the best competition in the world.  A lot of Verducci\'s article approaches the topic from what\'s almost an assumption that the Orioles were foolishly mistreating Arrieta all along, and they equally foolishly gave up on him too soon. This is supported here and there by anecdotes from players who faced Arrieta during some of these dark years, players who seemed to see the diamond waiting to be polished. One example is that then-White Sox first baseman Paul Konerko is said to have told Chris Davis of Arrieta in April 2012, ""That\'s the nastiest guy I\'ve seen in the past five years.""    Another comes from then-Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis, who had this to say after facing Arrieta during the 2013 season: ""I remember, in 2013, I faced Matt Harvey, Jose Fernandez and most of the nastiest pitchers you could think of. The guy with the best stuff of all was Jake Arrieta."" Presumably, Konerko made his comment when he faced Arrieta on\xc2\xa0April 29, 2011. Based on that quote, you might expect to look at the box score and find one of those scattered great games that Arrieta could put together to tantalize you about his potential. This is not the case. On that day, Arrieta\'s line was this: 5 IP, 5 H, 3 ER, 2 BB, 2 SO, 1 HR. What about Ellis, who was more impressed by Arrieta than he was by Harvey or Fernandez, the latter of whom won the Rookie of the Year award that season? Again, you\'d think Ellis may have witnessed Arrieta looking like Sandy Koufax returned to the mound. Ellis saw Arrieta on\xc2\xa0April 21, 2013. Ellis was so impressed by a day in which Arrieta pitched this line: 4 IP, 2 H, 5 ER, 5 BB, 6 SO, 1 HBP. Actually, Ellis also saw Arrieta post-Cubs trade in 2013,\xc2\xa0on August 26, 2013, when Arrieta\'s line looked like this: 5 IP, 6 H, 4 ER, 5 BB, 3 SO. Whatever the Cubs did for him, it wasn\'t an instant transformation. These guys saw the same maddening Arrieta with whom Baltimore fans were all too familiar. The annals of baseball are littered with pitchers who have great stuff who can just never harness it.    In and of itself, Arrieta flourishing there after failing here doesn\'t say a whole lot, no matter how impressed Verducci is with Arrieta\'s Pilates workouts. Heck, maybe it was the lack of Pilates that was holding him back all along. Corroboration from a second cavalry member What\'s new after Arrieta\'s recent no-hitter is that a second member of the cavalry has weighed in on Adair\'s tenure with the Orioles. Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports\xc2\xa0published an article on Monday in which he discussed the legendary streak Arrieta\'s fired off over his last 24 regular season starts: a 20-1 record and a 0.86 ERA. That\'s nuts. The interesting thing about this for O\'s fans is that Britton is quoted in the article, discussing that dark period for the cavalry. Speaking critically of what Passan sums up as a cookie-cutter approach, Britton said:  They took away the individual approach to everything. Things we did extremely well in the minor leagues to get to the big leagues - we were told that just doesn\'t work here. And you\'re like, \xe2\x80\x98That\'s kind of weird, right?\' You don\'t just reinvent yourself in the big leagues. That was the struggle. And the struggle, as we got older, was trying to get back to what made us what we were before.  Britton agrees that he, Arrieta, Matusz, and Tillman were all suffering underneath Adair at the time. That\'s pretty serious stuff, and maybe it is a possible explanation for Adair\'s mysterious departure in the middle of the 2013 season, and why Adair has been out of baseball since then. At some point, maybe enough was enough.    These are some fairly savage critiques, or at least they\'re being treated as such by the baseball writers who are making use of these quotes to paint the Orioles as a bunch of blundering dunderheads who ruin every pitcher they come across. Notably, Britton does insist that things are different now with the pitching/bullpen coaching duo of Dave Wallace and Dom Chiti, who publicly espouse different approaches, with individual styles and strengths being emphasized rather than some one-size-fits-all method of trying to assemble pitchers off an assembly line. That\'s a good thing, though Wallace and Chiti\'s success with the 2014 rotation certainly didn\'t carry over all the way to future years. It\'s a little too easy to blame it all on Adair Was it really as bad as all of that under Adair? Perhaps for Britton and Arrieta it truly was. However, being so laser focused on those two guys ignores the fact that the 2012 season was actually pretty good for the O\'s, and a big part of that was the out-of-nowhere contributions of a number of unheralded pitchers. In the bullpen, for instance, a quintet of relievers really flourished, some of them for the first time in their careers. That included the closer, Jim Johnson, a guy who no one really thought about and then suddenly he had 51 saves at year\'s end.    In the rotation, there was Jason Hammel, whom the O\'s were memorably ridiculed by ESPN\'s Keith Law for acquiring. Hammel proved to be a valuable member of the rotation, the only O\'s pitcher to start two games in the ALDS against the Yankees that year.\xc2\xa0Miguel Gonzalez came from the Mexican League to Norfolk and went on to become a solid starter for the team. Even Tillman, who was name-dropped by both Arrieta and Britton as being among the Adair-sufferers, finally found success as a starting pitcher at the MLB level in the second half of that season, success that continued for the next two seasons afterwards. These were things that also happened under the aegis of Adair. The Orioles were able to turn these pitchers, whose pitching arsenals were very diverse, into success stories that season. If Adair was the one great ruiner of pitchers, would any of that still happened? Well, maybe. It could be that all of those gentlemen succeeded in spite of Adair rather than because of him, that they were able to work around Adair where Arrieta, Britton, or Matusz never could. Still, it\'s important to keep in mind that reality is generally more complicated than ready-made narratives make it out to be. Maybe it turns out that the others were just more receptive to Adair\'s message or philosophy. There was definitely something that caused the cavalry to never turn out to be the cavalry. The belief of Arrieta and Britton that Adair was a big factor is significant. They were there. They would know more than me. But not even they know everything - their personal involvement means their recollections aren\'t exactly unbiased.    The O\'s recent track record is not encouraging you to think they\'ve fixed what needed to be fixed. That much is still concerning. Maybe things are getting better and that just hasn\'t had a chance to show itself yet. I won\'t be holding my breath. If we\'re lucky, four years from now we\'ll be reading in Sports Illustrated about how the Orioles were able to nurture Kevin Gausman into a Cy Young-caliber pitcher, rather than reading about how Gausman failed here but blossomed elsewhere. That\'s a topic for another day.

The Tampa Bay Rays look to produce another big pitching effort when they host the Baltimore Orioles for the middle contest of a three-game series on Tuesday night. The Rays used five pitchers to limit the Orioles to five hits during a 2-0 victory on Monday and can reach the .500 mark for the first time in almost three weeks with a victory as Jake Odorizzi takes the mound. Catcher Curt Casali had both RBIs on Monday for Tampa Bay, which has won six of its last nine contests after stumbling out of the gate at 3-7. Baltimore gives the ball to right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez after managing one run in the last two games and losing for the seventh time in 11 outings since a franchise-record 7-0 start. Manny Machado is 0-for-7 in the last two outings after starting the season with a 16-game hitting streak and slugger Chris Davis went 0-for-8 with four strikeouts the past two contests for the Orioles. Mark Trumbo has hit in 10 straight games and 16-of-18 on the season for Baltimore. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Ubaldo Jimenez (1-1, 3.71 ERA) vs. Rays RH Jake Odorizzi (0-1, 3.97) Jimenez has struggled with control his last two starts after a solid debut when he limited Minnesota to two runs (one earned) over seven innings. The 32-year-old Dominican Republic native walked four batters in each of the last two outings, but has struck out 20 in 17 innings overall. Logan Morrison is 3-for-3 against Jimenez, who is 4-1 with a 2.56 ERA in five career games versus Tampa Bay. Odorizzi comes in off the worst of four starts when he permitted five runs and eight hits over four innings at Boston before the Rays rallied for a 12-8 win. The 26-year-old has allowed 25 hits while striking out 23 in 22 2/3 innings overall. Adam Jones is 8-for-20 with a homer and Machado is 7-for-19 with a pair of blasts versus Odorizzi, who is 2-3 with a 4.94 ERA in 10 games (nine starts) against Baltimore. WALK-OFFS 1. Baltimore manager Buck Showalter has 1,351 wins, one away from tying Chuck Tanner for 30th on the all-time major league list. 2. Tampa Bay RF Steven Souza Jr. is 7-for-19 with two homers, five RBIs, four runs scored and three walks during a five-game hitting streak. 3. The Orioles optioned INF Ryan Flaherty to Triple-A Norfolk to make room for Monday starter RHP Kevin Gausman.

Even though Schoop is not seeing the ball well, he only has 13 strikeouts on the year. That is not a lot for someone who has struggled as much with strikeouts as Schoop has in his young career.There have been some bright spots.

Now, I could care less about being first in the division at this point. I just want the Birds to be playing well.The pitching continues to struggle to go deep in games, but overall are doing well. The bullpen continues to be very good as well.At this point, it is just a matter of getting the offense rolling again.Many Oriole fans may have expected the offense to no longer fall prey to slumps with their new approach in the first month of the season, with more patience at the plate.\xc2\xa0 So far, it appears that may not be the case.But, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the team is not working pitchers.

Rickard\'s rocket in the fifth inning against left-hander Matt Moore was the lone production the Orioles required on a night when Baltimore was out-hit 4-3. The Rays outscored Baltimore 5-1 in the first two games of the series. Rickard isn\'t known for his power. He managed a total of three homers the past two years in the minors. The 24-year-old rookie launched his first career major league home run in a victory over the Minnesota Twins on April 7 at Camden Yards  a 399-foot solo shot against reliever Trevor May. He had 13 home runs in his minor league career from 2012-15. Tillman continued his success at Tropicana Field  allowing two hits and two walks while striking out nine.

The Chicago White Sox, whose pitching staff continues to mow down opponents, engage in a battle of unlikely division leaders when they visit the Baltimore Orioles for the opener of a four-game series on Thursday. The White Sox are winners of six straight and began their road trip by holding powerful Toronto to six runs in a three-game sweep. Chicago finished off the Blue Jays with a 4-0 shutout on Wednesday to maintain their American League lead of 53 runs allowed in 22 games. The series in Toronto also saw the White Sox get a boost from their offense, which pounded out 21 runs in the set as newcomer Todd Frazier began to settle into the middle of the lineup with five hits and four RBIs in the series. The Orioles are one-half game ahead of Boston in the AL East but have dropped eight of 13 since a 7-0 start. Baltimore ended a three-game slide with a 3-1 win over Tampa Bay on Wednesday but managed only three hits in the contest and has totaled five runs in its last four games. PITCHING MATCHUP: White Sox LH John Danks (0-3, 6.23 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Tyler Wilson (1-0, 2.77) Danks is one of the few struggling pitchers on Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s staff but is coming off his first quality start. The 31-year-old, who allowed a total of 10 earned runs over 11 1/3 innings in his first two outings, held the Los Angeles Angels to two runs on five hits and five walks in six frames on April 21 but still took the loss. Danks is 6-5 with a 3.90 ERA in 13 career starts against Baltimore, including a home win last season in which he tossed seven scoreless innings. Wilson traded spots with Vance Worley, moving from long relief to the rotation, and was solid in his first start of the season at Kansas City on Saturday. The 26-year-old Virginia native allowed three runs and six hits in five innings but did not issue a walk and got enough support from the offense to come away with the win. Wilson made his first career start against Chicago on May 28, 2015 and absorbed a loss despite yielding two runs in six frames. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles 1B Chris Davis is 1-for-16 in his last four games. 2. Chicago C Dioner Navarro has recorded four RBIs and scored three runs in his last two contests. 3. Baltimore 3B Manny Machado is 0-for-15 over the last four games after hitting safely in each of his first 16.

Pitching carried the Chicago White Sox to the top of the American League Central, but they were unable to contain the big bats of the Baltimore Orioles in the opener of a four-game series. The visiting White Sox, who had their six-game winning streak halted in the 10-2 drubbing, send left-hander Carlos Rodon to the mound Friday night. Orioles third baseman Manny Machado, hitless in his previous four games, broke out of his rut with a grand slam and run-scoring double for a career-high five RBIs. Slugging first baseman Chris Davis ended a 1-for-16 slump with a two-run blast for Baltimore, which had scored a total of five runs in its previous four games. Chicago, which entered the series having allowed an American League-low 53 runs, lost for only the fourth time in 14 games away from home. White Sox closer David Robertson was placed on the bereavement list and will not be available until the series finale. PITCHING MATCHUP: White Sox LH Carlos Rodon (1-2, 4.05 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Mike Wright (1-2, 6.23) Rodon has only one victory despite turning in a quality start in three of his four trips to the mound, settling for a no-decision last time out after striking out seven and permitting two runs over 6 2/3 innings. It was a big bounce-back effort for Rodon, who was shelled for five runs in a career-low one-third of an inning by the Los Angeles Angels in his previous turn. Rodon lost his only start versus Baltimore, giving up four runs over five innings. Wright was en route to his best outing before unraveling late and wound up charged with five runs on eight hits, including a pair of homers, in a 8-1 setback at Kansas City on Sunday. The former East Carolina product also took the loss despite a quality start in his previous turn, giving up three runs over six innings in a 4-3 defeat to Toronto.

Until then, have to hope the bullpen stays fresh! "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles are Happy to be Home Again', 'The Baltimore Orioles put together a total team effort to defeat the red-hot White Sox 10-2 in the first of a four-game set at Camden Yards.It was a classic 2016 Orioles win: a sufficient start, a lock-down bullpen, and an offence that eventually bludgeons the opposition.The O\xe2\x80\x99s certainly enhanced their second-best on-base percentage number in the American League, coming in with a team number of .322 that trailed only the Sox of the other color. The Birds pounded out 15 hits and walked four times as well. Every starter got on base during the game, and only Caleb Joseph failed to get at least one hit.Having advocated here on The Baltimore Wire for Tyler Wilson to be a part of the rotation, it was gratifying and encouraging to see so many positives in the approach of the former UVA hurler. He certainly made a bad pitch in the first inning to Todd Frazier and paid for it by giving up a two-run homer. But Wilson pulled himself together after that and made one quality pitch after another. Never overpowering, he does know how to mix his pitches, all of which have good movement.Wilson was unfortunately unable to get the final out of the fifth inning and was therefore not the winning pitcher. In the not-too-distant future he will be allowed to go with a higher pitch count in that sort of situation. Two back-to-back 10-pitch at-bats were his undoing \xe2\x80\xa6 though each had borderline pitches go against him that might otherwise have ended the inning.But all in all, there is reason to believe that the Orioles truly have something in Wilson as a middle-to-late rotation piece who could be a regular every fifth day for some time to come.

The Orioles came into the game with a relief pitching ERA of 1.80, trailing the White Sox who were at 1.32.\xc2\xa0 However, the O\xe2\x80\x99s scored three earned runs off the Chicago bullpen, while their own relievers added an additional 4.1 scoreless innings. By my math, the Sox now have a bullpen ERA of 1.68 and the O\xe2\x80\x99s are at 1.70.The Baltimore relief contingent of Mychal Givens, Dylan Bundy and T.J. McFarland did yield six base hits, but they stranded all runners. Givens was particularly short of the nasty stuff and velocity sometimes seen, but he ended both innings he pitched with critical strikeouts. This is becoming a pattern with him, which is evidence of his maturity as a pitcher.And finally, the power returned home with the Orioles. After Manny Machado tied the game with a double into the right field corner that plated Joey Rickard, Chris Davis hit the next pitch out of the park. In two pitches, the entire game changed. Five pitches later, Mark Trumbo sent one out of the park. Machado later added a slam that indeed slammed the door on the first-place White Sox.Joe Danks was not very good on this evening. Good pitching can seriously slow down the Orioles, but anything short of that is going to get hit pretty hard. The separating factor for the O\xe2\x80\x99s this season will be whatever ability they muster to beat the better pitchers they will see.Here is an updated chart on prorated home runs and strikeouts (actually at this point, nine teams in the AL have more strikeouts than Baltimore, though some of them have played one or two more games) \xe2\x80\xa6MLB All-Time HRsO\xe2\x80\x99s All-Time HRsO\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 Pace264 (Seattle- \xe2\x80\x9897)257 (\xe2\x80\x9896)239MLB All-Time K\xe2\x80\x99sO\xe2\x80\x99s All-time K\xe2\x80\x99sO\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 Pace1553 (Hous.- \xe2\x80\x9813)1331 (\xe2\x80\x9815)1311\xc2\xa0In an unrelated note, I saw where former Orioles minor league pitcher Andrew Triggs made his debut for the A\xe2\x80\x99s against the Tigers a couple of days ago, pitching a hitless inning with one strikeout.

That oversimplifies. Arrieta was a top college pitcher and his first team, the Baltimore Orioles, considered him a potential ace, with a smoker of a fastball and a heartbreaking curveball.His control, however, was miserable, and his pitches ran when they should have cut. His E.R.A. scaled unsightly peaks.

05/01/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Taking the Bad with the Good', 'Apr 28, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles left fielder Hyun Soo Kim (25) stands by home plate during the eighth inning against the Chicago White Sox at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Baltimore Orioles defeated Chicago White Sox 10-2. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles lost to the Chicago White Sox 8-7 Saturday evening in an odd game they should have won several times.Almost everything about this game was upside-down from what is normally seen from the O\xe2\x80\x99s. The bullpen blew the game and gave it back to the Sox. The defense faltered and allowed several runs that should have never scored. And several struggling players had good offensive games.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 relievers have been so good that it was inevitable that there were going to be some runs yielded at some point. And it happened last night \xe2\x80\x94 five runs in the final three innings.Chicago managed a run off Mychal Givens. Brett Lawrie walked and stole second base. He really would have been out had Jonathan Schoop properly handled the throw from Matt Wieters. But getting the ball to stick in his glove was a problem throughout the evening for Schoop. He only tallied one error, but there were several other situations where he either did not get the glove to the ball (on a Machado throwing error), or did not get the ball to stick in the glove. It was very strange, enough to make you wonder if he was seeing properly; although a typically massive Schoop home run would tend to negate that theory.Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day came into the game next to settle the situation and protect the one-run lead. He had gone 8.2 innings in 10 appearances, giving up only five hits while striking out 14. But on this night he would give up three runs on three hits, including a Todd Frazier homer.The winning Chicago run would be charged to Zach Britton, the batter reaching on a two-out bunt single in which Britton was injured on the play. Bringing in Vance Worley, he struck out the batter with a definitive strike, but did not get the call due to Wieters rising up to be positioned for what was a fake steal. A walk and single later, and the Orioles were behind and doomed to fall by an 8-7 score.Much has been written about two struggling Orioles hitters: Hyun Soo Kim and Pedro Alvarez. Each garnered three hits on the evening and looked very good at the plate.After falling behind 7-5, the Orioles came back to do something no other team had done in a great while \xe2\x80\x94 score off former Oriole Matt Albers. The big blow was a clutch two-run double by Chris Davis.So it was a weird game for sure. A lot of ground balls for the White Sox found holes, while the Orioles hit some hard balls right at fielders. Some nights it just does not go your way, and Saturday was one of them.

They are hitting the ball well again (although Chris Sale is next!). And the starting rotation has been quite good. Kevin Gausman was better than his line would indicate. His stuff was excellent most of the evening and he deserved a better fate.Over the past six games the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters have thrown 34.1 innings, giving up 10 earned runs on 24 hits with 11 walks and 33 strikeouts. This works out to a 2.62 ERA and WHIP of just over 1.00.\xc2\xa0 That is very, very good. And if this can largely continue, the Orioles are going to have a successful season.

Left-hander Chris Sale has been instrumental in the Chicago White Sox\xe2\x80\x99s fast start to the season and will go for his major league-leading sixth victory in the finale of a four-game series at Baltimore on Sunday. The White Sox outlasted Baltimore 8-7 on Saturday night after dropping the first two games of the series. Sale has allowed one earned run over 24 innings spanning his last three starts, helping Chicago tie a franchise record with 17 wins in the month of April. Jose Abreu delivered the game-winning RBI single in the ninth inning Saturday and is 9-for-22 during a five-game hitting streak. The Orioles fell to 10-1 when leading after seven innings and suffered a double whammy when closer Zach Britton sprained his left ankle and limped off the field with two outs in the ninth after attempting to field a swinging bunt. Ubaldo Jimenez starts the series finale for Baltimore, which lost for only the second time in 11 home games. PITCHING MATCHUP: White Sox LH Chris Sale (5-0, 1.66 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Ubaldo Jimenez (1-2, 3.91) Sale has pitched at least seven innings in all five of his starts, remaining perfect with another dominant performance last time out by limiting Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s powerful lineup to one run and four hits over eight frames. Sale did not permit an earned run in each of his previous two turns, picking up a pair of wins despite Chicago scoring a total of three runs. He blanked the Orioles for 7 2/3 innings last year but is 1-2 with a 3.72 ERA against them. Jimenez has regressed following an outstanding season debut in which he struck out nine, did not walk a batter and permitted one earned run over seven innings to beat the Minnesota Twins. He has battled control issues during a winless three-start stretch, walking 11 over 16 innings, and has received only six runs of support during that span. Brett Lawrie is 4-for-11 with a homer off Jimenez, who owns a 3-4 mark and 4.17 ERA in 12 starts versus Chicago. WALK-OFFS 1. White Sox DH Avisail Garcia, who is 7-for-13 versus Jimenez, is expected to miss his second straight game with a hamstring injury. 2. While Britton is listed as day-to-day, Orioles RHP Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day had a streak of 10 scoreless appearances halted Saturday. 3.

However Hardy is probably a bigger concern at this point, especially seeing that the conventional wisdom is that Britton will avoid the DL.Ubaldo Jimenez suffered from a tough fifth inning, as the Orioles fell and split the series at two games each. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.2 IP, 7 H, 6 R, 4 BB, 3 K.

The ChiSox squared up several balls on Jimenez in the fourth inning, however with the exception of Lawrie\xe2\x80\x99s homer (which gave Chicago a 1-0 lead), they all resulted in outs. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t squaring balls up in the fifth inning, yet they produced a big inning. That\xe2\x80\x99s baseball.The Orioles yielded a run on Sanchez\xe2\x80\x99s force out with the bases loaded, and then a second on an RBI-single by Abreu. Cabrera then sent a soft fly ball into left field, which fell for a bloop single \xe2\x80\x93 scoring another run. However Chicago got a bit selfish, trying to send a second runner home. And he was gunned down at the plate.Add in another soft single to center which netted two runs, and Chicago led 6-0. The Orioles would add an RBI-single by\xc2\xa0Nolan Reimold in the last of the sixth, but Chicago also added a sac fly-RBI in the ninth to run the score to 7-1. Again with the exception of the Lawrie homer, Chicago bled and blooped the Orioles to death yesterday. While Jimenez wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really on his game from the beginning, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of those deals where if the outfield is playing just a bit more shallow\xe2\x80\xa6things might have been different.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a scan tomorrow to see the extent of it.That sounds like the thinking in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse is that Hardy could have a broken bone in his foot. That would be something that would undoubtedly end up being a DL situation for the shortstop, who of course is an integral part of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 infield defense.

Obviously we don\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure that would be the corresponding move, however that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m predicting. Again luckily for them, today is an of day. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles minors 5/1: The Gunk makes his Triple-A debut ...', ' Indianapolis (Pirates) 4, Norfolk Tides 0 Each team had a total of four hits and committed two errors, but the Indians picked up four runs while the Tides were shut out. Go figure. It\'s actually a bit remarkable that the Tides didn\'t score at all, given that they also drew seven walks in the game. Leadoff man Xavier Avery picked up a couple of hits. So did the rest of the team combined.    Some silver lining in the game is that it was a decent Triple-A debut for Joe ""The Gunk"" Gunkel. This is not actually his nickname except to Stacey and myself. The Gunk was charged with three runs in 5.1 innings, which doesn\'t sound so good except for the fact that only one of the runs was earned. He gave up that one earned run on three hits and a walk and struck out four batters. Harrisburg (Walgreens) 9, Bowie Baysox 3 The Jason Garcia as a starting pitcher experiment has not been off to an auspicious beginning. Yesterday\'s game was not any exception to this, with Garcia getting blasted for the full Tommy Hunter (five runs, all earned). That came over six innings. His season ERA is now 6.86. Perhaps ""only"" walking two batters is progress, but then, he gave up eight hits also, so what good is it? Rehabbing Jimmy Paredes and recently-demoted Joey Terdoslavich each picked up two hits for the Baysox. Shortstop Adrian Marin singled in his lone at-bat and also drew three walks. I like plate discipline.    Frederick Keys 5, Winston-Salem (White Sox) 2 Five runs on six hits for the Keys - very efficient scoring. The star of the game was catcher Jonah Heim, who picked up a solo home run, scored two runs, and threw out his 13th would-be base stealer of the season. So far this season, Heim is batting .203/.329/.373 - not a great average, but that\'s a great walk rate and solid power when he is connecting. Maybe the eventual capable backup to Chance Sisco?    A quality start for 2014 18th rounder Matthew Grimes, who gave up two runs on four hits and two walks in 6.1 innings of work. After five starts, Grimes has a 1.75 ERA for the Keys. Not high stock on this guy since he\'s a 24 year old in High-A, but if he keeps pitching like that, maybe he\'ll earn himself a chance in Bowie.

Hardy be Missed?', 'Apr 27, 2016; St. Petersburg, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy (2) fields a ground ball during the eighth inning of a baseball game against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field. Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy will be missing for six to eight weeks with a fractured foot due to a foul ball. How much will this hurt the O\xe2\x80\x99s both offensively and defensively?I would submit that the total damage is not as much as is generally thought. Having said that, understand that I believe it would be better if this had never happened. It is just that an honest evaluation puts this in a better perspective than a first glance might indicate.An answer to our primary question will involve who fills the vacancy both in the field and at the plate as a result of the opening in the batting order. And there will certainly not be one person who fills the hole day in and day out. Buck will switch things around with several players and varied matchups \xe2\x80\xa6 as he should.Defensively speaking, there is no scenario we can put together for the Orioles that makes them better without Hardy than with him. Whereas Manny Machado may not be much of a drop-off, and a day may come where he will be better than Hardy with the glove, that probably is not today. And this creates an opening at third base that nobody is going to cover in the same way.Offensively speaking, there may be some scenarios where the team is actually better, especially in terms of power, if not also with other factors like on-base percentage.Ryan Flaherty is being recalled, and playing him at third base with Manny moved to shortstop is the simplest solution. This retains a positive and strong defense with little drop-off in offense and even an increase in power.Though Flaherty is no offensive mega-threat, the fact is that Hardy is no longer terribly scary either. For the 2014-16 seasons, Hardy is hitting .247 with an OBP of a mere .285.\xc2\xa0 There have been 19 home runs, or about one in every 57 plate appearances.Flaherty over the same period has the same OBP and a lower average at .211, but he has 16 home runs in about half as many plate appearances. Flare-dog has been hitting better this year, at least in spring training and in his recent little stint in the minors (8-for-19).The Orioles have had an extra pitcher and playing short on the bench, so bringing up an additional infielder like Paul Janish is possible. He is an outstanding defensive player \xe2\x80\x94 nearly as capable as Hardy \xe2\x80\x94 and though never known for much production, he has been hitting exceptionally well at Norfolk. Right now he is batting .318, and he did hit .286 in 14 games with the Orioles last year. The O\xe2\x80\x99s have held onto Janish for just such a time as this, knowing that Hardy has been a bit fragile in recent years.I believe there is a better solution than these above, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will happen. This suggestion is not as strong defensively, but it would make the lineup definitively better. Put Chris Davis at third base, Mark Trumbo at first base, Nolan Reimold in the outfield, and Pedro Alvarez at designated hitter.If it seems crazy to have Davis at third base, that may be because of a short memory. When the Orioles first had Chris Davis from Texas, he was more of a third baseman than first baseman. He has played a total of 89 career games at the hot corner. There were concerns before the 2012 season as to whether Davis could make the transition to first base. The big guy is a great athlete and could do a commendable job at third.

But neither is he overly lucky about staying on the field. And I feel badly for him to as to how much this hurts, remembering college baseball and thinking there was nothing in the world quite so painful as a foul ball off the foot. Catchers might dispute that claim however.In any event, it is sad to lose Hardy again, but it is not devastating for this team as constructed and with the options available.

The sliding New York Yankees look to snap a pair of five-game losing streaks when they begin a three-game series at Baltimore on Tuesday. Although their bats finally broke out after an extended slump, the Yankees fell 8-7 in Boston on Sunday for their fifth consecutive setback, matching their longest skid since a six-game run last May. They enter Camden Yards desperate for a turnaround but also carrying a five-game slide versus the Orioles, who have won 21 of the last 34 meetings overall. \xe2\x80\x9cI think everyone believes in each other in here,\xe2\x80\x9d New York first baseman Mark Teixeira told the New York Daily News after being swept by the Red Sox. \xe2\x80\x9cWe just have to play better. That\xe2\x80\x99s just the way it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s a small sample size right now, but it\xe2\x80\x99s getting bigger.\xe2\x80\x9d One of the many players the Yankees need to turn it around is right-hander Luis Severino, who gave up 32 hits in 19 2/3 innings in April and will oppose Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Tillman in the opener. The Orioles, who dropped a pair of games to the Chicago White Sox over the weekend to fall out of first place in the American League East, placed shortstop J.J. Hardy on the disabled list Monday with a hairline fracture in his left foot that is expected to keep him out of action for at least six weeks. PITCHING MATCHUP: Yankees RH Luis Severino (0-3, 6.86 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Chris Tillman (2-1, 3.24) Severino had seemingly turned a corner with a solid outing in a no-decision against Oakland on April 21, but he was hammered for six runs on seven hits in just three frames at Texas last Tuesday. He has allowed two home runs and walked just three but opponents are hitting a robust .372 against the 22-year-old. Severino faced the Orioles in his final start of the 2015 season, holding them to three runs in a career-high seven innings. Tillman also was roughed up in Texas on April 14 but has bounced back with back-to-back solid starts while allowing two runs in 12 2/3 innings. He struck out a season-high nine and yielded two hits in a win at Tampa Bay on Wednesday, the third straight start in which he has not given up a home run. Yankees designated hitter Alex Rodriguez is 6-for-13 with four home runs against Tillman, who sports a 4.96 ERA in 16 career starts versus New York. WALK-OFFS 1. Rodriguez is 6-for-14 with three home runs in four games since taking two days off to rest a strained side. 2. Orioles 3B Manny Machado has four straight two-hit games. 3. Yankees All-Star RHP Dellin Betances has surrendered a home run in three straight appearances, including two go-ahead blasts against Boston.

05/04/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Ups and Downs of Chris Tillman', ""Baltimore Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman is off to the best start of his career after beating the Yankees on Tuesday night 4-1.Tillman has had some ups and downs over the years, having a particularly rough start in the 2015 season. And though 2014 was an incredible year for him over the final four months, I remember being at his start against the Pirates on May 1st of that year \xe2\x80\x94 a day where he threw over 50 pitches to get through the first inning.Tillman often has a rough start in games as he searches for the feel of his pitches. Over his career he has a 5.21 ERA in first innings and 4.82 in second innings. But after that it is all in the twos and threes.And struggles have happened more than just at the beginnings of games, it has been true of the beginnings of season. In the first two months of the baseball year his combined ERA is 4.65.\xc2\xa0 But for June through the end of seasons, it is 3.96.\xc2\xa0 August is his best month.So it is especially encouraging for O\xe2\x80\x99s fans to see Tillman off to a good start for this 2016 campaign.The following graph shows Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s numbers for his first six starts over the past four years. I am not counting back to 2012 when he began well with the Orioles and was 5-1 with a 2.38 ERA, but his first start was on July 4th after being called up from the minors\xe2\x80\xa6YearRecordIPERHBBKERA20163-132102412332.8120152-431.2223518236.2620143-136.2153712353.6820132-134.2143315283.63\xc2\xa0Currently, opponents are batting .211 against Tillman, who also has a WHIP of 1.13 in spite of a few too many walks. Even last night he allowed four of them while striking out nine. On three occasions he walked the leadoff hitter.The key for Tillman is to have most or all of his four pitches working. He never really had great fastball command last night, and the strike zone was incredibly pinched. But this other three pitches had some nasty movement, and Tillman was able to pitch out of trouble.On another note \xe2\x80\x94 and no extra charge for this \xe2\x80\x94 I have been especially following the Frederick Keys this season. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned previously, we are the host family for one of the players named Matthew Grimes, who was incidentally named the Carolina League Pitcher of the Week for last week. He won his two starts, pitching 11.2 innings and giving up three runs on 10 hits, registering eight strikeouts. For the season he has a 1.75 ERA in five games.Next: How much will the O's miss J.J. Hardy?The Keys are on the road right now, and Matthew pitched on Sunday. But a story to mention here is that I quickly looked in on the score of the game a few times last night, ultimately seeing that Frederick came from behind to win 8-7. Looking later at the box score, it was very strange. They only had six base hits. How could this be? There was only one homer in the game. But then I saw the tally of the bases on balls! The Keys picked up 16 walks in the nine inning game! First baseman Wynston Sawyer walked five times in the game, scoring three runs. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen such a thing even in Little League.

It was the 13th time in 24 games that they have not managed more than two runs.

He allowed two home runs to Mark Trumbo and dropped two soft tosses from Mark Teixeira while covering first base, the second of which allowed another run to score.As he walked back to the mound after the second drop, Severino was patted on the back by Teixeira, a gesture of support and encouragement that the Yankees are finding themselves increasingly needing as they sit in last place in the American League East at 8-16. The last time they were this many games below .500 was in 2007, when they started the season 21-29.Before the game, General Manager Brian Cashman tried to direct some of the heat away from his players, coaches and Girardi by accepting blame for the poor start and reiterating that no changes were afoot \xe2\x80\x94 for the moment.

But that will turn around.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Yankees trotted out their usual lineup and looked little different from the way they have all season. The seven runs they posted Sunday night in an 8-7 loss at Boston looked like an aberration as the night wore on.

A potentially robust inning had been undercut one batter earlier, when Starlin Castro grounded into a double play.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees put runners on in each of the first six innings, but every half-threat petered out. The only extra-base hit was Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s double off the right-field wall in the first. And a promising start to the sixth, in which Teixeira walked and McCann blooped a single to left, soon fizzled. Carlos Beltran lined out to right, and Castro lined into a double play when McCann was caught off first.The Yankees struck out nine times against Chris Tillman, who matched his career high. He had entered the game with a 4.96 E.R.A. against the Yankees.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Rodriguez, who had shown signs of coming alive with two home runs over the weekend in Boston and five R.B.I. on Sunday night, flied out, struck out and grounded out in his three at-bats.

New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez told his teammates prior to Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s matchup in Baltimore that there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason they can\xe2\x80\x99t score five runs per game. It took one night for Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s words to take hold with the Yankees, who hope to carry the offensive momentum into Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s series finale against the host Orioles. Although Rodriguez was placed on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday, New York snapped a six-game losing streak with a 7-0 drubbing that night for just its fifth victory in its last 20 games at Camden Yards. Leadoff batter Jacoby Ellsbury recorded three hits and reached base in all five plate appearances while Brian McCann drove in three runs to break an eight-game RBI drought for the Yankees, who will be wrapping up a nine-game road trip. Even though Baltimore has dropped three of four, the move from third base to shortstop hasn\xe2\x80\x99t affected Manny Machado, who has registered three doubles in seven at-bats in the series. Orioles right-hander Kevin Gausman will oppose New York ace Masahiro Tanaka in Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s rubber match. PITCHING MATCHUP: Yankees RH Masahiro Tanaka (1-0, 2.87 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (0-1, 2.45) Tanaka sailed through six scoreless innings at Boston on Sunday but wound up being charged with two runs and six hits over 6 2/3 frames in his fourth no-decision. It was the third consecutive start of at least six innings for the Japanese standout, who has recorded 18 strikeouts versus one walk over 20 2/3 frames in that span. Tanaka is 1-1 with a 3.03 ERA in four career starts against the Orioles but has served up six homers in 29 2/3 innings. A meltdown by Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen wiped out Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s chance for a victory after he gave up three runs (two earned) in six innings against the Chicago White Sox on Saturday. It was only the second start of the year for Gausman, who yielded one run and three hits over five frames in his season debut versus Tampa Bay following a case of tendinitis in his right shoulder. Gausman is 3-2 with a 2.79 ERA in 11 career appearances (five starts) versus the Yankees. WALK-OFFS 1. New York has scored a total of 15 runs in Tanaka\xe2\x80\x99s five starts. 2. Orioles closer Zach Britton, who sprained his ankle on Saturday, is expected to throw another bullpen session Thursday. 3. The Yankees recalled LHP James Pazos from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to take Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s roster spot. PREDICTION: Yankees 5, Orioles 3  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), (""Orioles walk off in 10th after Gausman's eight shutout ..."", ' The Orioles and Yankees engaged in a true pitchers\' duel tonight as Kevin Gausman and Masahiro Tanaka matched each other pitch for pitch through eight scoreless innings of baseball. It wasn\'t until the tenth inning that the O\'s bats finally broke through, and the game winning RBI came from a very unlikely source.    With Hyun Soo Kim at third base (he reached base twice tonight) and no outs, Buck Showalter sent in Nolan Reimold to pinch run as the Yankees\' interim manager (Joe Girardi was tossed for being a crybaby earlier) called for Andrew Miller from the bullpen. The peanut gallery gasped, ""What is Buck doing!?"" Sending a sold right-handed option to pinch run while allowing Pedro Alvarez to face Andrew Miller seemed insane. As we all prepared for the strike out, Alvarez surprised us. Instead he sent a fly ball to medium center field. Reimold raced home head of the throw to score the winning run as Alvarez was mobbed at first. Great win! Gausman\'s Great Game Kevin Gausman was masterful tonight. He didn\'t strike the world out, recording just four over his eight innings of work, but the Yankees could not figure him out. He gave up only three hits and didn\'t walk a batter. It was a lot of fun to watch.    After retiring the first six batters he faced, Gausman gave up his first hit of the day on a ground ball off the bat of Aaron Hicks. It went up the middle and second baseman Jonathan Schoop ranged to the middle and was almost able to make a play. The next batter, Didi Gregorious, perhaps knowing how few chances they\'d have against Gausman on the night, bunted on the first pitch. It went right back to Gausman, who threw out the runner at second, and then got the next two batters.    The only extra-base hit of the night came in the fourth inning when Starlin Castro doubled down the left field line. Castro moved to third on a fly ball to Adam Jones. Jones looked like he had a chance to get Castro at third but the throw was off line. Gausman didn\'t need the help, though. Neither Mark Teixeira nor Carlos Beltran could bring the runner in from third. Teixeira\'s ground out kicked off a run of nine outs in a row by Gausman. It wasn\'t until Teixeira came up again in the seventh inning that another Yankee reached base. Teixeira singled to center field with one out and was promptly erased on an inning-ending double play.    Goose mowed \'em down 1-2-3 for his eighth and final innings. He finished his night with 97 pitches and a pitching line of 8 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 4 K. What a night. O\'s Tank Against Tanaka Unfortunately for Gausman, the rest of the Orioles, and the Orioles fans, Masahiro Tanaka was just about as good as Gausman. He\'s been the Yankees best pitcher this year and it showed tonight. The Orioles did have a few chances that they coudln\'t capitalize on. In the third inning, Ryan Flaherty and Adam Jones singled to put runners on the corners with two outs, but the slumping Chris Davis grounded out. They put two more runners on base in the fourth thanks to Matt Wieters\'s second single of the game and a walk from Hyun Soo Kim, but Jonathan Schoop frustratingly grounded into an inning ending double play on the first pitch.    After that Tanaka completely shut the O\'s down, retiring 12 of the final 13 batters he faced. He exited the game with the score tied 0-0 and turned things over to the Yankees bullpen. Orioles Prevail in Bullpen Battle Darren O\'Day and Zach Britton pitched for the O\'s out of the bullpen today and they weren\'t as dominating as we\'d like to see. O\'Day got two outs in the ninth but gave up a two-out single to Castro. With Brian McCann coming to the plate and O\'Day being kind of shaky against lefties this year, Buck Showalter went to Zach Britton. It was Britton\'s first game since twisting his ankle last Saturday, and he was clearly rusty. He went to a full count on McCann and allowed Castro to get to second on a wild pitch, but then Wieters caught Castro wandering off of second and picked him off to end the inning. It looked like the O\'s might win the thing in the ninth inning, but the combination of a great catch by Dustin Ackley and a TOOTBLAN from Joey Rickard ruined that dream. Against Dellin Betances, Mark Trumbo worked a one-out walk and was replaced by Rickard as a pinch hitter. Matt Wieters hit a long fly ball to right field that looked like it had a chance to get out of the park. Instead Ackely made a great catch up against the right field wall. Rickard seemed to think that the ball hit off the wall and just stood on second base looking confused as he was easily doubled up. Argh!    Britton continued to look rusty in the 10th as he walked leadoff batter McCann. Just as I started to get worried, Britton turned the corner. He struck out Teixeira, Beltran, and Ackely swining to get out of the inning. After using Betances for the ninth inning, the Yankees had both Andrew Miller and Johnny Barbato warming in the bullpen. I don\'t know much about Barbato, but I knew I\'d rather the Orioles faced him instead of Miller. It was Barbato who came in for the 10th. Yes! The first batter he faced was Kim, who hit a high Baltimore Chop in the infield. He hustled to first ahead of the throw to get on base as the winning run. Next up was Jonathan Schoop, who lined a ball to left-center field for a single. Kim continued to hustle and made it all the way to third base. That set the stage for the Alvarez vs. Miller showdown. Here are the facts: Alvarez is terrible against lefties. Andrew Miller is one of the finest lefties in the game. So far this year Alvarez hasn\'t played in any games with an lefty was starting, and has gone 1-for-9 against them this season. Miller had faced 8 lefties this year with one hit and five strikeouts. What I\'m saying is that the odds weren\'t good. Well you know what we say about that: Never tell me the odds. Alvarez didn\'t strike out. He sent a fly ball to the outfield, which was all he needed to do. The Orioles walked off against Andrew Miller and that\'s pretty satisfying.

You\xe2\x80\x99re going to have courses through the season where you play bad baseball. It just so happens that ours is April, and it\xe2\x80\x99s magnified. We still have a long time to get this turned around, and that\xe2\x80\x99s got to be our mind-set in here. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got five months to continue to climb up the standings, and that\xe2\x80\x99s just the reality to it.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The Yankees took at least one step in the proper direction later Wednesday, getting a turn-back-the-clock performance from C. C. Sabathia and three R.B.I. from McCann to break open a tight game and beat the Baltimore Orioles, 7-0. The victory ended a six-game losing streak that had, at times, seemed more like 60.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cWe felt like we clinched a playoff berth,\xe2\x80\x9d left fielder Brett Gardner said.Nobody was more responsible for ending the skid than Sabathia, whose previous trip here had ended with his walking into Manager Joe Girardi\xe2\x80\x99s office last October and leaving the team to check into an alcohol rehabilitation clinic. Sabathia, who had done little so far this season to engender much confidence that he could be more than a passable fifth starter, threw seven shutout innings \xe2\x80\x94 the first time he had done that since April 7, 2013.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a big contrast from me standing in this locker room the last time,\xe2\x80\x9d Sabathia said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be able to go out and get us a win felt great.\xe2\x80\x9dSabathia, who allowed six hits and two walks and struck out six, used his cut fastball and his fading changeup to work both sides of the plate. He also mixed in his slider and his two-seam fastball. His pinpoint control left the Orioles so off balance that when he worked up in the zone with his marginal fastball, he was able to sneak it by, as he did in striking out Joey Rickard and Manny Machado.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Sabathia induced three inning-ending double plays and escaped a first-and-third, one-out fix in the fifth by striking out Rickard with a letter-high 87-mile-per-hour fastball before retiring Machado on a liner to center field.

He descended the dugout steps into a swarm of teammates offering high-fives.Sabathia was not the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 only encouraging performer. Jacoby Ellsbury reached base five times, one of them on a single that began the three-run rally in the sixth that broke a scoreless tie. McCann contributed with a run-scoring single in that inning and a two-run double in the eighth, when the Yankees put the game out of reach.Carlos Beltran started the four-run rally in that inning with a ringing double.It was a bounty of riches of a kind rarely enjoyed this season by the Yankees, who had been held to two runs or fewer in 13 of their first 24 games. The only real cause for concern at the end of the night was the condition of Gardner, who took a bases-loaded fastball from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Dylan Bundy on his right elbow in the eighth. It was a painful way to drive in a run.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Gardner left the game in the ninth. Although X-rays were negative, it seemed unlikely that he would play Thursday when the Yankees finish their road trip.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  On Wednesday, Beltran replaced Rodriguez as the designated hitter, a role that Girardi said would also fall to Teixeira and McCann.The decision to replace Rodriguez on the roster with reliever James Pazos raised eyebrows, but Girardi said it was in deference to the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 schedule. On Tuesday, they began a stretch in which they play 20 games in 20 days, and Girardi emphasized that they might not carry 13 pitchers through that entire stretch.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Also to be determined is the extent of Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s injury.

05/06/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Day games, night games, and which one ...', ""The Baltimore Orioles and other northeastern teams don\xe2\x80\x99t play as many day games as some other teams. Which way is better?With the weather being what it is, you have to wonder if the Baltimore Orioles are going to play tonight. Where that leaves things for the series, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I suspect that they\xe2\x80\x99d probably play a doubleheader tomorrow, with game one starting at 1 PM and game two at the regular 7 PM. A similar scenario happened a couple of years back when the LA Dodgers were making their only visit to Camden Yards.Day games are unfortunately something that we don\xe2\x80\x99t regularly see in Baltimore, aside from Sunday and Opening Day. Without counting a few 4 PM Saturday starts, the Orioles have exactly two daytime games during the week scheduled at home for the remainder of the season. One is in a few weeks for a series finale against Seattle (with the Birds heading to the west coast after the game \xe2\x80\x93 explaining the matinee). The other is Memorial Day Monday afternoon.I\xe2\x80\x99m a big fan of day games, probably because I\xe2\x80\x99m somewhat of an old school baseball guy. The roots of the sport are afternoon games. Of course that\xe2\x80\x99s primarily because ballparks didn\xe2\x80\x99t have lights to be able to play games at night. Now they do, which is why so many games are in the evening.

But they still don\xe2\x80\x99t play many games in the afternoon during the week. Why is this even an issue, you ask?The answer is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not \xe2\x80\x93 per se. It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of personal preference. However afternoon games during the week are special occasions in a sense. Fans feel like they\xe2\x80\x99reCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sportsdoing something wrong in the sense that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking time off from work and playing hooky. However at the end of the day, most teams who play day games during the week do so because it\xe2\x80\x99s getaway day.I suspect that the reason the Orioles and other teams in the northeast play so few day games is because they\xe2\x80\x99ve done studies. The teams know that they have the best shot at optimizing attendance if games are at night as opposed to during the day. There are exceptions to this, of course \xe2\x80\x93 Wrigley Field being one of them.

Sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll get people listening on the radio during work hours, however that\xe2\x80\x99s still a tough sell for fans.But again, I would like to see teams loosen up on this a bit. In the golden era of the sport, the games started in the early afternoon. Now there are people out there who are going to say times change and so forth, and I understand that. But again, mid-week day games are special events in baseball. Next: Baltimore Orioles' offense being figured out by the competition?It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me if the Birds end up playing a day game tomorrow, as part of a doubleheader. At this time obviously, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\xa6but who\xe2\x80\x99s to say they don\xe2\x80\x99t manage to get the game in tonight! "", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Rob Long: Surprising Rotation In Orioles Pitching &amp; Hitting', ' During spring training all of the talk surround the Baltimore Orioles indicated that this team would put up a ton of runs but have problems protecting early leads because of shaky starting pitching. Many believed if the starters could just get a lead to the bullpen, the team would be in good shape, but getting them there would be an accomplishment. Well, lately the O\xe2\x80\x99s haven\xe2\x80\x99t had problems with pitching. In the past 10 games, dating back to Kevin Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s season debut in Tampa, the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 starters have managed to give the club seven quality starts. Now, you can go ahead and criticize the definition of a quality start (at least six innings while allowing no more than three earned runs) but it is what it is. That\xe2\x80\x99s baseball in 2016 and many if not most doubted whether or not the rotation could give the team that type of support. Chris Tillman has looked stud-like during that time with a combined 13 2/3 innings while only allowing one earned run. In fact, since the nightmarish first inning against the Toronto Blue Jays where he allowed two runs, Tillman has been nearly impossible to figure out. Maybe Tillman isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnumber one starters,\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly looking like the Orioles number one starter. Kevin Gausman has been giving Tilly a run for his money at the top of the rotation. The 25 year old started the 2016 season on the disabled list but has given the team a jolt since his return. In three starts, including his eight inning gem on Thursday, Gausman has given up only three earned runs in 19 innings to the tune of a 0.68 WHIP. Opponents are batting .152 against him in what my colleague Dave Johnson from MASN would say is a \xe2\x80\x9csmall sample size.\xe2\x80\x9d During that same 10-game span the potent offense of the Orioles has managed only 33 runs, including the 10 run explosion in the first game of this game stand against the Chicago White Sox. They also put seven on the board in a loss last Saturday against the Sox so over half of their total came in two games. That\xe2\x80\x99s not what anyone expected from this line-up. You have to speculate that the hitters will heat up as the weather does and produce more than they have. Some would also suggest if you\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing the \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d line-up of the O\xe2\x80\x99s that the success of the rotation isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d either. I believe Tillman and Gausman are giving you close to what they\xe2\x80\x99re capable of giving you. Also, Yovani Gallardo in on the disabled list and is more than capable of pounding out innings upon his return. The only question marks are what Ubaldo Jimenez shows and who are Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson? That\xe2\x80\x99s why we LOVE baseball though. Oakland comes to town and Ubaldo will have a chance to redeem himself from his last performance when he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get through five innings.. His performance was one of only two outings where the starters could not do so. Game time is 7:05 p.m. and you can hear it on 105.7 The Fan.  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Defending the Denigrated Rotation', 'The starting rotation for the Baltimore Orioles is most often thought to be the weak link on the team, but there is reason to hope for better outcomes even in the near future.Without doubt, though I have often defended the starters over recent years in the face of what I perceive to be frequently wrongful and unjust criticism, it was difficult to contend for them in 2015. After posting the fifth-best ERA in the American League in 2014 at 3.61, they then dropped to 14th a year later at 4.53.Currently the Orioles starters are in the very middle of the AL pack at eighth place with a 4.31 ERA, and they are ninth in the statistical category of batting average against at .252.\xc2\xa0 The league average for each is 4.19 and .256.So it is pretty average at best. But there is a better way of looking at this.Let\xe2\x80\x99s take out the nine combined starts of Yovani Gallardo (4) and Ubaldo Jimenez (5). They have ERA numbers of 7.00 and 5.40.\xc2\xa0 The total ERA of all other starting pitchers other than these two is 3.58.Now I do understand that any team could take their starting rotation and drop out their two worst performers and significantly decrease the ERA.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s just take out one of them \xe2\x80\x94 Gallardo \xe2\x80\x94 since he is on the DL with no imaginable timetable as to when a return could happen. Adding Jimenez back in, the new ERA is 3.93.\xc2\xa0 In other words, that is the team starting pitching ERA of the current staff on the active 25-man roster. That is not going to be the best in the league, but add this to the top-tiered bullpen and the potent lineup, along with arguably the best defense, and you have something quite commendable.Steve Melewski of MASN put together another similar summary along this same line yesterday by writing \xe2\x80\xa6If you take Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s three starts this season,\xc2\xa0Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0last three starts and the last start each for\xc2\xa0Tyler Wilson\xc2\xa0and Mike Wright, you get an ERA of 1.78 with 10 earned runs over 50 2/3 innings and seven quality starts in eight outings. A nice run, indeed.So I do think the rotation is going to be fine. To be truthful, I worry more about how this lineup is so effectively shut down when they run into a strong pitching performance, as they did in the final two games with the Yankees and on several other occasions already this year.In an unrelated note, I thought the second base pickoff throw of Matt Wieters on Thursday night was one of the more impressive plays I have seen this year. That would seem to indicate that his arm is completely fine! As a pitcher, it is great when the catcher gets you out of an inning, which Matt did after the Zach Britton walk and wild pitch that put the runner at second base with two outs.

As a collegiate pitcher, I had a great catcher with a big arm (and a power bat \xe2\x80\xa6 who later played some minor league ball). One time I walked the first two batters in an inning. For some reason, the other team attempted a double steal on the first pitch to the third hitter. He swung through a fastball and the catcher threw out the lead runner at third. On the next pitch which was a four-seamer called a strike, like Wieters, my catcher came up and picked the runner off second base. My third pitch was a slow breaking ball in the dirt that the hitter chased and missed. The pitch went to the backstop where the catcher chased it down and nailed the batter at first by a step.You gotta love a catcher like that. And the Orioles have two of them, both of them playing today in the doubleheader with Oakland. The O\xe2\x80\x99s now have Mike Wright starting in the first game at 1:05 and Jimenez pitching in the darker environment at 7:05. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

05/09/2016,"[(""The Orioles' outfield defense has hurt the team - Camden Chat"", ' Going into the 2016 season the Orioles had a blueprint for an ideal season. It looks very similar to the 2014 Orioles season. The 2014 team had an above average offense, defense, and bullpen. The rotation was good enough to get the game to the bullpen. If the Orioles were going to be good in 2016, the team was built for a similar style of play. Thus far, the results in the win column have been pretty good.\xc2\xa0I wrote before the season started about what was going to have to go right. So I have wondered how the team has ranked so far in 2016 in those categories. Below is a table of where the Orioles rank in the league in a number of categories.       Year wRC+ Offensive WAR Starter ERA Bullpen ERA UZR   2014 6th 7th 12th 6th 2nd   2016 7th 8th 16th 3rd 22nd    Not so surprisingly considering the 18-12 record, the plan so far has been executed. The offense is in a very similar territory (please note these numbers do not include yesterday\'s dong fest). The rotation has been better of late and is right around the middle of the pack which is all this team needs at this point. Furthermore,\xc2\xa0Kevin Gausman\'s improved curve ball and\xc2\xa0Chris Tillman\'s cutter give the rotation a bit more upside. Also, the bullpen, probably the surest thing going into the season, has been fantastic. The 3rd best bullpen ERA in all of baseball and everyone of the key members of the bullpen have been consistently great.    The surprising laggard to date has been the defense. A bottom third defense for the Orioles is going to severely hurt their run prevention. To be quite honest I am surprised to see the ERA of the team so low with such a poor defense. It is still early in the season for defensive metrics, but on a team wide basis the trends have already come into focus.    The drag on the defense so far probably will not surprise many ardent Orioles observers. The outfield defense has been atrocious. In fact, it has been the worst defensive outfield in baseball according to Ultimate Zone Rating (-11.1) and Defensive Runs Saved (-16). The only above average aspect thus far has been avoiding errors. The outfield defense was not going to be the strong point of the team coming in, but so far it has been a glaring weakness. If you have questions about UZR, DRS, or any of the other crazy\xc2\xa0acronyms\xc2\xa0I throw in these posts, the Fangraphs Glossary is a great tool for learning. They have\xc2\xa0concise\xc2\xa0definitions\xc2\xa0and links to\xc2\xa0articles\xc2\xa0that go more in depth about each statistic.     To date, only Nolan Reimold has posted a positive UZR in a mere 110 innings in the outfield. The typical outfield of Adam Jones, Mark Trumbo, and Joey Rickard have altogether dragged down the defense. Adam Jones currently at -1.2 UZR and -4 DRS. Mark Trumbo has also dragged the defense down with a -4.5 UZR and a -5 DRS. Surprisingly, to me, is that Joey Rickard has been particularly poor according to the metrics posting a -7.3 UZR and a -7 DRS. Rickard in particular is of a concern to me. The book on Rickard was that the Orioles should expect good defense. His numbers are likely hurt by being pressed into center field duty, but you would still like to see some better results thus far. Also, I am aware that is still early in the season and especially early for individual defensive metrics, but to my eye Rickard hasn\'t been inspiring on defense. He takes some ""banana routes""\xc2\xa0as noted Twitter personality Luke Jackson has pointed out. I did pick up on the broadcast this week someone talking about Rickard\'s defense and according to Buck the upper decks of major league stadiums can mess with a fielders\' depth perception and it may take some time getting used to. I\'ll buy that premise for a bit, especially after today when Rickard had two good running catches in the left center field gap.    I know that I have thrown out a lot of acronyms at you and I know I keep reminding you all and myself that it is still early and that a whole lot more innings are needed to know anything certain about the team especially the defense. Yet, the early trends are not great for the blueprint. A substandard defense will come back to hurt a team that already has a lackluster pitching staff. For the Orioles sake, they need their pitchers to keep the ball on the ground and hopefully headed towards Manny Machado.

We owe a lot of teams some whuppings, and the Orioles are one of them,"" third baseman Trevor Plouffe said, alluding to the three games they lost in Baltimore in early April that built the foundation for a 0-9 start they\'ve yet to recover from.First baseman Joe Mauer was in the leadoff spot for the first time in his career, an experience he and the Twins were forced to wait another day for. Manager Paul Molitor said he\'d likely keep the order the same for Tuesday night, with shortstop Eduardo Nunez second, second baseman Brian Dozier third and Plouffe batting cleanup. Right fielder Miguel Sano was fifth.Despite the five-game losing streak the Twins (8-23) took into this series, they weren\'t actually looking for ways to avoid the field.""I like to play when we\'re supposed to play,"" Molitor said.Reporters actually broke the lineup news before the game to Mauer, who leads the American League with a .420 on-base percentage, about his new assignment.""I told Paul a long time ago that whatever gives us the best chance to win and score some runs I\'m all for it,"" said Mauer, who has hit third for the majority of his career and sometimes second.Said Molitor: ""In a lot of ways, you can make the argument for Joe being your best \'1\' hitter, your best \'2\' hitter and your best \'3\' hitter. So he\'s tried \'2\' and \'3.\' We\'re going to try him at \'1.\'""The Orioles (18-12) didn\'t need the break, either.This was their fourth postponement already this season, including a rained-out game Friday against Oakland that was made up with a Saturday doubleheader. They\'ll lose another scheduled day off with this development, having arranged to play June 20 at Texas to make up for the weather-halted April 17 game. The Orioles also have an April 9 postponement against Tampa Bay that has not yet been rescheduled.The Orioles and Twins will play Tuesday night and Wednesday afternoon, but with the forecast calling for more rain a doubleheader would be a tenuous bet. This was only the 13th postponement in the seventh year for the Twins at Target Field.Rain fell throughout the afternoon, preventing both teams from taking batting practice. With the tarp still on the infield, the national anthem was sung and the ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by Minnesota Lynx center Sylvia Fowles. The skies had been dry for about an hour when the Twins made the announcement to call off the game. Radar showed heavy precipitation approaching, but many of the customers trickling out were predictably confused and disappointed.""Where\'s the rain?

Because of the doubleheader Saturday, either Ubaldo Jimenez or Mike Wright would have had only three days of rest to take the series finale and still keep the rotation in order, but the weather kept the Orioles from having to add a temporary starter to the mix.Twins: Molitor pushed rookie RHP Jose Berrios back one day to start Tuesday, and RHP Phil Hughes will now take the mound Wednesday.

The Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense is clicking on all cylinders after smashing a season-high six home runs in their most recent win, while the Minnesota Twins\xe2\x80\x99 engine is sputtering as a result of missing most of its key parts. The Orioles look to continue the suffering of the American League-worst Twins when the clubs open a three-game set in Minnesota on Monday. Manny Machado blasted two homers \xe2\x80\x93 and finished with a career-high six RBIs \xe2\x80\x93 while Mark Trumbo also went deep and fell a double short of the cycle to lead Baltimore to an 11-3 rout in the rubber match of its series with the Oakland Athletics on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just really want to play a good game \xe2\x80\xa6 because you don\xe2\x80\x99t get many opportunities where you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a full house and the weather\xe2\x80\x99s letter perfect,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter told reporters after the win. The Twins are scuffling for offense as a result of most of its infield either being on the disabled list (shortstop Eduardo Escobar) or nursing injuries (catcher Kurt Suzuki, second baseman Brian Dozier and third baseman Trevor Plouffe). Minnesota, which has dropped nine of 10, was swept in Baltimore to begin the season as part of its 0-9 start and mustered only seven runs while losing all three of its games in Chicago against the White Sox over the weekend. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Tyler Wilson (1-1, 3.04 ERA) vs. Twins RH Jose Berrios (1-1, 6.75) After beginning the season in the bullpen, Wilson turned in his best start in three tries since joining the rotation in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s loss versus the New York Yankees, allowing three runs (two earned) on four hits and three walks across six innings. The Virginia product has posted a 4.02 ERA in three turns after recording a 1.13 ERA as a reliever, but his last outing was the first in which he lasted more than five frames. Wilson took over for Chris Tillman after a rain delay on opening day, tossing three scoreless relief innings against the Twins. Berrios flirted with danger all night in his last outing but held on for his first victory last Monday, working around three hits \xe2\x80\x93 including a pair of homers \xe2\x80\x93 and five walks while fanning eight over 5 1/3 innings at Houston. The effort was an improvement for the 21-year-old Puerto Rican, who gave up five runs over four frames in a loss to Cleveland in his major-league debut on April 27. Berrios has baffled right-handed hitters through his first two career starts, allowing only one hit in 13 at-bats against them. WALK-OFFS 1. Machado on Sunday became the first player to have a game with at least two home runs and six RBIs as a shortstop since Juan Uribe on Sept. 23, 2010. 2. Dozier (hamstring) did not start in any of the three games against the White Sox over the weekend but hopes to return to the lineup for the opener. 3. Baltimore has belted at least three homers in six games this season and leads the AL with 43.

That would translate to a 97-win season.The team has displayed many of the features anticipated: a powerful long-ball lineup that can be shut down by excellent pitching, a top-notch bullpen, and an inconsistent starting rotation. Whereas the strengths are being largely utilized, the weaknesses are along trending in a healthier direction.After a mild fumble by Mike Wright in the doubleheader opener on Saturday, the veterans Ubaldo Jimenez and Chris Tillman came back with quality starts. They gave up only a total of five runs in 14.1 innings.Manny Machado is simply now one of the elite stars of the sport, becoming one of those players where fans of other teams are personally interested in seeing play. Machado\xe2\x80\x99s six RBIs on two homers gives him 22 for the season on nine home runs. This is a pace to hit 49 round-trippers with 119 runs batted in.Chris Davis and Adam Jones, though productive in varied ways and at varied times, are both only hitting .200 at this point. You know they are going to pick it up and hit at a better average than this, and when they do, what might the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup produce at that point?Perhaps Davis and Jones can follow in the path of Jonathan Schoop. After getting off to a somewhat slow start in the first 19 games and batting .200, he has an 11-game hitting streak wherein he is 14-for-40 (.350) to raise his average to .257.Chris Tillman on Sunday continued another trend we have seen in 2016. After his almost obligatory difficult first inning, he found the feel for his off-speed pitches as the game went along. When he throws them for strikes, he becomes nearly unhittable. Tillman was not sharp throughout the game, but when he found the curve in the sixth inning, he set down three hitters on strikeouts on just 10 pitches. His ERA is now at 3.05.

Manny went yard twice. \xc2\xa0Mark Trumbo, Joey Rickard, and Johnny Schoop did as well. As much as Manny\'s grand salami was the icing on the cake, the proverbial moment of yesterday\'s glorious afternoon was Pedro Alvarez\'s moonshot onto Eutaw Street. Alvarez needed a punctuating stamp as an Oriole, so a walk-off sac fly and a permanent marker in front of the warehouse in a matter of days is a pretty good start.    Having taken two of three from both the Yankees and Athletics, the Orioles head north to Minnesota for a three-game series with the Twins. The poor Twinkies are 8-23, and in only 31 games, appear to be in the midst of a season already lost. An opening series sweep by the hands of the Orioles can help to gauge where the two sides stand, but where the Orioles are growing in confidence, the Twins are not. Though it would be expected for the Orioles to fly out of Minnesota with the very least a series win, I\'ll be at the first two games. If history proves true, my presence alone will be the Orioles downfall. If that\'s the case, I\'m sorry, but it isn\'t often I get to see the Orioles play. Game 1 Probables RHP Tyler Wilson (1-1, 3.04 ERA) vs. Jose Berrios (1-1, 6.75 ERA) T-Wizzle, Twilly, or whatever moniker you prefer, Wilson has picked up where he left off in his short time last season. A quiet contributor, Wilson\'s arsenal includes a natural cut-fastball, an emerging changeup and a curveball, most of which he\'ll use in any count. Command and confidence of all of his pitches has allowed him to keep the ball in the ballpark, evidenced by a 52.6 GB%. He doesn\'t rely on strikeouts, instead maneuvering the baseball around the barrel of the bat. It takes a master of some skill to work in such a way, but Wilson understands what he is, who he is, and better yet, knows how to pitch. He tossed three scoreless innings against the Twins on Opening Day, so there is a bit of familiarity there. Berrios came into the year as MLB.com\'s 16th overall prospect, and for good reason. He sits 92-94 MPH on his fastball, where he\'ll mix in a changeup as well as his crown jewel, the curveball.              <picture class=""c-picture"" data-cid=""site/picture_element-1494631908_8905_23989"" data-cdata=\'{""picture"":true,""dynamic_picture"":false,""convert_picture"":false}\'>            <img srcset=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OW-3yc-mw4vD-S_QC3Y7sYXwmeo=/0x0:718x404/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6458147/uNbuuKR.0.gif 320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9zJNwsvG6pEhZuqfvSApbzjzyrI=/0x0:718x404/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6458147/uNbuuKR.0.gif 520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RhKW6mM-sdtDSSx2OuhOTvX-51c=/0x0:718x404/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6458147/uNbuuKR.0.gif 720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R8Tn8YSymFoYoI4b-IE5ocVkQNU=/0x0:718x404/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6458147/uNbuuKR.0.gif 920w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LXsGvbOEGCUTIUsFszMWdrdUvcU=/0x0:718x404/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6458147/uNbuuKR.0.gif 1120w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8gicZ7EBJ7dMTyHKqMi3Pq-M7xk=/0x0:718x404/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6458147/uNbuuKR.0.gif 1320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1q20-prTN-Bcrk2VgqVLu19x_c=/0x0:718x404/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6458147/uNbuuKR.0.gif 1520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kC4EkIwoCIahcnIz4iAb5SDDm4I=/0x0:718x404/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6458147/uNbuuKR.0.gif 1720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1q6s8xPRsRYfN4eJLT0qBxArSyk=/0x0:718x404/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6458147/uNbuuKR.0.gif 1920w"" sizes=""(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IC9qtvNl1sbD9VJyU4qkvR0WihM=/0x0:718x404/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6458147/uNbuuKR.0.gif"">  </picture>          Berrios had a case of the yips in his first major league start, going 4.0 innings, surrendering five runs on six hits. Berrios settled down in his second start, pitching into the 6th inning while striking out eight. The Astros are built much like the Orioles, where Berrios\' swing-and-miss stuff will likely play to his advantage. Though, the O\'s are always one swing away from rattling anyone\'s confidence.      Game 2 Probables RHP Kevin Gausman (0-1, 1.42 ERA) vs. RHP Phil Hughes (1-5, 5.85 ERA) Not to build up hopes only to have them come shattering down, but in a year where Gausman is expected to blossom into more, he\'s shown it just might happen. Gausman has tweaked his breaking ball into a useful pitch, while also utilizing his splitter with more frequency. Gausman is still flashing the heat, but by becoming more well-rounded as a pitcher, his fastball becomes that much more effective. It wouldn\'t be wise to believe his .176 BABIP will uphold throughout the year, but Gausman is striding to a new level and perhaps a start at Target Field is another stepping stone. Hughes is what he is. His fastball velocity is slowly declining, he throws a lot of curveballs and cutters, and he gets hit very, very hard. All of his tomfoolery doesn\'t equate to many swings and misses out of the zone (21.6% chase rate), and as such, he won\'t see many strikeouts. The Orioles managed three runs in Hughes\' final inning of work in his first start of the year, and he is coming off of a two-inning disaster in Houston. This matchup bodes well for the Orioles.      Game 3 Probables TBD vs. Ricky Nolasco (1-1, 4.70 ERA) It appears the Orioles are going to tab Vance Worley in a spot-start on Wednesday, in order to keep the rotation from straying out of line. Though my opinion on Worley is surely in the minority, his contributions thus far have been about as well as realistic expectations could have expected. Worley throws any pitch in any count, and in the process, he\'ll spin it, cut it, curve it, moving the baseball in every tangible way. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\'t. Maybe it works on Wednesday. Nolasco is a fastball-slider pitcher that\'s going to feature the two exclusively, though he will offer a curveball and splitter as well. He throws a lot of strikes, doesn\'t issue many walks, but that more or less means a lot of contact. For the Orioles, that\'s good news. No pressure to walk means more fun to swing and the O\'s are good at that. Nolasco\'s peripherals don\'t align with his advanced numbers, meaning he\'s bound to find results more suited to the way he\'s pitched. Let\'s see if he waits another start for that to happen...

05/10/2016,"[('Who has been the most disappointing Oriole so far ...', ' The Baltimore Orioles have played, for the most part, good baseball in the early part of the 2016 season. Considering how many question marks there were in the offseason, the team\'s performance has been rather surprising. The rotation is actually good. Mark Trumbo has been a revelation at the plate. And many of the expected positives, like a strong bullpen and tons of dongs, have come through. That said, don\'t kid yourself. Some Birds have been bad. Like, really, really bad. But who has been the worst?    Crush crashing Don\'t get this wrong, Chris Davis has been a bright spot for the Orioles. He leads the team in walks, has hit eight home runs; each one more majestic than the last, and, even though advanced metrics paint him as an average defender at first base, his ability to pick throws out of the dirt has proved invaluable to his fellow infielders. But he signed a seven-year, $161 million with the expectation that he would still be one of the best power hitters in baseball for the next two seasons, at least. So far, he\'s not doing that. His .436 slugging percentage is sixth on the team behind guys like Jonathan Schoop and Nolan Reimold. And, while Davis is not expected to compete for batting titles, hitting .200 won\'t cut it. My gut tells me he will turn it around, but early signs have him looking more like 2014 Crush rather than the 2015 version. DFA him already There has to be another LOOGY on the free agent market that is better than Brian Matusz. Even lefties are hitting .250 against him and they are getting on base at a .625 clip. Righties are slashing .455/.462/.727 with a home run over 13 plate appearances.    This comes a season after he was, arguably, at his best. In 2015, he turned in an ERA of 2.94, a career low, and an ERA+ of 140, a career high. Something must be wrong now, right? He was even worse with Bowie in rehab outings in April before returning to the bigs a few weeks ago. Based on the fact that Norfolk currently has six southpaws on their roster, Matusz needs to pick it up immediately, or he will be out of a job.    Slow starter The mid-March signing of Pedro Alvarez left some scratching their heads. Sure, the Orioles could have used another left-handed bat, but they needed that same guy to be able to play right field. Alvarez can barely hold it down at first base let alone track a fly ball. BUT HE HITS DONGS! Yeah, except he hasn\'t done much of that. As the team\'s primary designated hitter, the slugger is slashing .206/.320/.381 with two home runs, five doubles and seven RBI. However, his 11 walks are the second-most on the team. He is taking ball four 14.7 percent of the time, the best mark of his career. And he is striking out just 20 percent of the time, the lowest rate of his career. Plus, he is notoriously bad in March and April, hitting .197 in those months as a major leaguer. There is hope for him still.    Qualifying offer craziness What can $15.8 million buy you? Apparently, not a very good catcher. That is Matt Wieters\' salary this season, and it looks as though it may be a huge waste of money. Over 20 games, he is slashing .211/.282/.282 with one home run, two doubles, eight RBI, seven walks and 22 strike outs. And he has caught on back-to-back days only twice so far. In the field, he is throwing out 50 percent of base stealers (3-for-6) and his catcher\'s ERA (whatever that\'s worth) is a nice 3.35. Meanwhile, his back-up, Caleb Joseph has had equal struggles with the bat (.205/.295/.231), has only tossed out 4 of 17 would-be base stealers, and has a CERA of 4.13. So, there is no real pressure for Wieters to not be the first choice behind the plate. But Joseph also makes just north of $500,000 per year, not $15.8 million. So, the two should not have similar-looking batting lines. Especially when manager Buck Showalter insists on batting Wieters fifth or sixth, a fringe RBI spot. His 28.2 percent strikeout rate is ridiculously high for a guy with one round-tripper. Move down the lineup, Wiety.    Worth a draft pick? All the buzz words were there. ""Veteran arm"". ""Reliable veteran"". ""Steady production"". They never mentioned the mid-80s fastball when Yovani Gallardo signed on for two years and $22 million at the end of February. After four starts, the right-hander found himself on the disabled list with shoulder tendinitis, a 7.00 ERA and a .319 opponent\'s batting average. The 30-year-old\'s strikeout rate continued its downward trend. At the time of his injury, he was getting strike three just 4.50 times per nine innings pitched. This is a guy that, at the height of his career, was sitting nearly 10 guys down in that same time frame. According to Fangraphs, his fastball was averaging 87.2 mph before he got hurt. 87 MPH? For a right-hander? In his age 30 season? What the what? To his credit, opposing hitters have a .333 batting average on balls in play. That will drop. And his current 3.8 percent fly ball is incredibly low, so that means he wouldn\'t give up too many long balls. But the Orioles knocked a year off the original deal between the player and the club because of something their doctors saw. And now, Gallardo is out with a problem that he admitted he had never felt before. That sounds ominous. The former all-star will begin throwing on Saturday and, even though the rotation has done a nice job so far, an upgrade over Mike Wright would be a boost. Maybe his ""rib area"" is still bothering him If he\'s not hurt, then Adam Jones is just really awful this year. But let\'s get real, Jones is still probably dealing with a problem in his rib area, which goes back to the season\'s first week. It\'s commendable how dedicated he is to his craft and that he feels as though he does need to earn his paycheck, but the center fielder is becoming a burden to have in the lineup every single day. He has a slash line of .200/.269/.274 with one home run, four doubles and nine RBI and is still being allowed to hit in the middle of the order. This has him perfectly positioned to be a rally killer. The eight double plays he has hit into are tied for the most in baseball.\xc2\xa0He can\'t even hit against pitchers that aren\'t pitchers.    Fangraphs gives him a WAR of -0.5. Baseball Reference is even harsher with a -1.0 WAR. Both values are the worst on the Orioles. Even fielding has been a struggle. Jones has just one assist so far. And his current UZR/150 of -9.0 would be his worst value since 2007, when he was a 21-year-old with the Mariners. For all of those reasons, Jonesy has been the most disappointing Oriole of 2016, but I have faith that he can turn it around...eventually.

That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like the Adam Jones Baltimore is used to, so naturally the question that comes up is, should we be worried?In my preseason projections, I mentioned that Adam Jones is a bit of an oddity. He swings at everything, has a terrible OBP, and yet somehow keeps hitting the ball. I also mentioned that, because of that style of hitting, Jones is ripe for a massive crash one year.So have we hit that year? Jones has no power so far, and he just can\xe2\x80\x99t get on base. So what\xe2\x80\x99s going on? Is this the year he crashes? Is it time to panic? Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the statistics.oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dBaltimore Orioles reliever Brad Brach: From afterthought to starring roleMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton Injury Isn't So Devastating2d - MLB: Laz Diaz strikes again - But the pitch was outside, of course2d - Boston Red Sox Coming Down Hard on Racism2d - Baltimore Orioles Zach Britton Out Six to Eight Weeks4d - Are the Red Sox and Orioles baseball's new rivalry?More News at Birds Watcher  First off, I should mention that we know Jones was hurt, and he was hurt for a while. For whatever reason, the Orioles in their infinite wisdom decided against putting him on the DL, something that major league baseball teams do that bothers me to no end. I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather a player be out for 15 days and just get healthy than to sit in the injury purgatory known as \xe2\x80\x9cday-to-day\xe2\x80\x9d.It\xe2\x80\x99s more than likely that Jones\xe2\x80\x99 injury has affected his hitting to an extent, but even when we look at the stats, things actually look ok. Jones has unfortunately been the victim of some bad luck.First of all, his BABIP is at .240, which is very low for him (his career BABIP is .310). Also, his HR/FB rate is insanely low, all the way down at 4%. The league average is generally around 10% and Jones\xe2\x80\x99 career average is 15.2%. Now, if he were hitting less fly balls, or hitting the ball softer, this would make sense, but he isn\xe2\x80\x99t. His fly ball rate is about where it always is, and his hard hit rate is about a percentage point higher than his career rate. So he\xe2\x80\x99s still hitting fly balls, and he\xe2\x80\x99s still hitting them hard, he\xe2\x80\x99s just not getting them out of the park yet.One thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ve found exceptionally interesting is that his walk rate is actually above average (for him) this year. Typically, Jones has a walk rate around 4%, but so far this year, he\xe2\x80\x99s at 7.7%, which is, sadly, the best he\xe2\x80\x99s had in his entire career.So in summary, Adam Jones is hitting the ball just as much as he usually does, just as hard as he usually does, and is actually showing a bit more patience at the plate than normal. He\xe2\x80\x99s just getting very unlucky with where the ball is falling, his low BABIP and HR/FB rate are huge testaments to that.So is it time to panic about Adam Jones?

Relievers in the bullpen made side bets on how fast Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s fastball would top out, and fans\xe2\x80\x99 oohs and aahs were based on the speed his pitches registered, not their location.With the Yankees in need of a distraction from their disappointing start, the debut of Chapman, the hardest-throwing pitcher in baseball, was most welcome.He was even able to overshadow the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 hitters \xe2\x80\x94 who hit five home runs \xe2\x80\x94 despite showing some signs of vulnerability in finishing off a 6-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Monday.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Young had signed with Kansas City as a free agent after earning comeback player of the year honors with Seattle in 2014. But the Yankees had no interest, Cashman said, because Young is one of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s most extreme fly-ball pitchers and fly balls at Yankee Stadium \xe2\x80\x94 especially ones to right field \xe2\x80\x94 often turn into home runs.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Cashman\xe2\x80\x99s assessment was spot-on Monday as the Yankees hit each of their home runs over the inviting right-field porch, with Beltran joined by Brian McCann, Brett Gardner and Aaron Hicks. Gardner, Hicks and Beltran homered in the third inning, when Young, who has allowed a major-league-leading 13 home runs, was knocked out of the game.

The three lead the majors in strikeouts by relievers since the start of 2014.Although Betances and Miller warmed up, neither entered the game.But Chapman did.\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a show,\xe2\x80\x9d Betances said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as he starts throwing the ball in the bullpen, the whole crowd gets up and takes out their phone.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In the dugout, players and coaches leaned on the railing and stole glances at the top of the center-field scoreboard, where each pitch\xe2\x80\x99s velocity is displayed.

He began this outing as if there were not much difference.He struck out Omar Infante with a 97-m.p.h. fastball and then Cheslor Cuthbert with one that reached 101 before Paulo Orlando ripped a 90-m.p.h slider over the head of Hicks, the center fielder, for a double.

That\xe2\x80\x99s not easy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  There was some question about what type of reception Chapman might receive because he has expressed little contrition about the actions that had led to his suspension. (He fired eight gun shots into his garage after an altercation with his girlfriend, according to a police report.)But the cheers relieved him.\xe2\x80\x9cI was very excited and happy to see the fans receive me the way they did, but I was looking to stay focused and get the job done,\xe2\x80\x9d Chapman said through an interpreter. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people have been asking me about that. But after the reaction I got today, I can say it was incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  It was as complete a game as the Yankees have played this season, and it harked back to last season, when they owned baseball\xe2\x80\x99s second-best record as late as July 27. Not only did they belt homers and get strong pitching Monday, but Teixeira had two superlative scoops of errant throws from shortstop Didi Gregorius, turning a potentially troublesome inning into a smooth one.Nova was outstanding in replacing C. C. Sabathia, who went on the disabled list with a strained groin, having thrown eight shutout innings against the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday. Nova, who had lost out to Sabathia for the final spot in the rotation, allowed only one run in four and two-thirds innings, on a homer far over the center-field wall by Alex Gordon, reminiscent of the blast he hit in Game 1 of the World Series.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Kirby Yates, who allowed one hit in one and two-thirds scoreless innings of relief, picked up the win. And Ben Gamel, a rookie outfielder, had something to celebrate, too: He stroked a single to left field in his first career plate appearance, as a pinch-hitter in the eighth.

Tyler Wilson (2-1) gave up two runs and six hits in seven innings.Miguel Sano hit his fourth homer for the Twins (8-25), who have lost seven straight games. Phil Hughes (1-6) allowed five runs and six hits while lasting just four innings in another terrible start for the worst team in the American League.The 3-4-5 hitters for the Orioles \xe2\x80\x94 Jones, Davis and Trumbo \xe2\x80\x94 went 10 for 15 with four homers, nine RBIs and seven runs scored.Trumbo opened the scoring with a two-run homer in the second inning, and then recorded his third multihomer game of the season when he followed Davis\' two-run shot in the fourth with his 11th homer.The Orioles became the 15th team in big league history to hit back-to-back home runs in three straight games. If they pull it off again on Thursday back home, they will join the 1964 Minnesota Twins as the only teams to do it four times.It all came at the expense of Hughes, who has seen the velocity on his fastball drop significantly over his last three starts in which he has lasted a combined 11 innings. He only made it two innings in his previous start, and the inability of the starters to pitch deeper into games has heavily taxed Minnesota\'s bullpen just six weeks into the season.Pat Dean made his big league debut in relief of Hughes, giving up two runs in 2 2/3 innings.Wilson yielded a homer to Sano in the second inning and an RBI single to Danny Santana in the fifth, but was hardly touched the rest of his outing by the slumping Twins offense.In his second game in the leadoff spot, Minnesota\'s Joe Mauer had two hits.TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: RHP Brad Bach was available to pitch one day after getting hit in the right leg by a line drive. Bach had a bruise on the back of his leg, but otherwise was unharmed.Twins: Closer Glen Perkins (left shoulder strain) will throw his first bullpen on May 23. If all goes well the hope is he will be back sometime in early to mid-June.UP NEXTOrioles: RHP Ubaldo Jimenez (2-3, 4.54 ERA) will open a four-game series in Baltimore against the Detroit Tigers on Thursday.

Mandatory Credit: Peter G. Aiken-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles took apart the Minnesota Twins 9-2 by hitting four home runs from their three biggest bats.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are paying a bunch of the boys to hit home runs, and the team got plenty of bang for the buck on Wednesday afternoon. In a place not known for homers, Mark Trumbo hit a pair of them with Chris Davis and Adam Jones adding one each. Davis just barely missed another, getting an RBI double instead.We say these are the three biggest bats, and they probably are the first three players expected to hit homers. If you take a 162-game average for each, Davis hits 37, Trumbo 31 and Jones 25. But there are others who are growing into similar power hitters, having had shorter careers and total games played. Manny Machado is now at 26 per 162 games (and growing), with Pedro Alvarez at 28. Beyond this also is Jonathan Schoop with 23 \xe2\x80\xa6 a number that will expand as well.The Baltimore Orioles team on display in Minnesota on Wednesday is the one envisioned and hoped for in 2016. There is the obvious power with the four home runs. As expected also is the bullpen that comes on with a lead and eliminates any additional scoring by the opponent. And hoped for was sufficient rotation pitching, particularly from newer and younger starters. Tyler Wilson provided the final element with seven innings of two-run ball, lowering his ERA to 2.94.The O\xe2\x80\x99s starters have had a rather solid streak of games. It is not record-setting, but it is very solid. Seven of the last eight games have been quality starts, with only Mike Wright\xe2\x80\x99s last game not qualifying. But even that was a game with few hard-hit balls. At this point, the starters beyond Wilson have these ERA statistics: Gausman \xe2\x80\x93 2.16 / Tillman 3.05 / Jimenez \xe2\x80\x93 4.54 / Wright \xe2\x80\x93 5.83.\xc2\xa0 The trend is a good one.The Orioles did more than just hit home runs on Wednesday afternoon in Minnesota when beating the Twins and the threatening weather. They pounded out 16 total hits, the best number of the season. Half of these were by Jones and Davis, each going 4-for-5.\xc2\xa0 In doing so, Jones saw his average raise from .210 to .238, and Davis went from .217 to .242. Knowing the way both players are able to carry a team, if they get hot, it could be very interesting to see what kind of scoring the Orioles can post.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles Win 5-3 And Deliver The Twins Their Sixth Loss ...', ' By The Sports Xchange MINNEAPOLIS \xe2\x80\x94 An early season slump has caused Baltimore Orioles to put in plenty of extra work to try and find a way out. Tuesday night against the Minnesota Twins, that hard work paid off. Jones had a pair of hits, including a two-run single in the top of the ninth inning to break a tie game as the Orioles won 5-3 at Target Field. Baltimore has won three straight games and sits tied atop the American League East with the Boston Red Sox. Minnesota has lost six straight games and 10 of its past 11 overall. Jones entered the game hitting .200 with one home run and nine RBIs in the first 26 games of the season. After getting rained out on Monday, Jones spent extra time in the hitting cages to try and get things right. The early returns are promising: He matched the homer total and equaled one-third of his previous RBIs on Tuesday, getting a pair of hits in five trips to the plate. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to be as good as he\xe2\x80\x99s capable of,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a feel-good because you know how much it (bothers him). He\xe2\x80\x99s got a great way of not taking himself too seriously but you know it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of been grinding on him. You know he cares.\xe2\x80\x9d With the game tied at 3-3 in the ninth, Twins right-hander Kevin Jepsen got a strikeout and a pop out in foul territory to start the inning. But a double to left by Joey Rickard and an intentional walk to Manny Machado put two men on for Jones, who smashed a shot toward Twins left fielder Oswaldo Arcia. Arcia didn\xe2\x80\x99t take a proper route to the ball and it landed in front of him, caroming off Arcia\xe2\x80\x99s foot when his diving attempt at a catch came up short. Both runners, who had advanced to second and third on a wild pitch, scored on the play. \xe2\x80\x9cI gotta get that third out,\xe2\x80\x9d Jepsen said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the bottom line.\xe2\x80\x9d Jones also mashed the second of back-to-back home runs off Twins starter Jose Berrios in the fifth inning, which gave the Orioles a 3-1 lead. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing good baseball as a team,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as we keep winning, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter how it goes as long as the team wins. That\xe2\x80\x99s the main objective, the main goal.\xe2\x80\x9d Machado had three hits, including his 10th homer, and walked twice. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day got the win in relief of Kevin Gausman, pitching one inning of relief. Jepsen took the loss, dropping to 2-4 on the season. Jepsen was charged with two runs, both earned, on three hits and a walk in an inning of work. Orioles closer Zach Britton worked a perfect ninth for his eighth save. Trevor Plouffe had a pair of hits, including a two-run homer, and drove in all three Twins runs. Gausman allowed three runs on five hits and two walks, striking out nine in a no-decision. The homer he allowed to Plouffe in the sixth inning prevented him from a chance at a victory. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously, I was upset after the home run. Anytime you\xe2\x80\x99re cruising and in your last inning, one of the worst pitches you throw gets hit out of the park to tie the ballgame,\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the back of my head, I always try to think \xe2\x80\x98Go nine innings,\xe2\x80\x99 but to give your team a chance to win, a quality start is all you really need to do.\xe2\x80\x9d Twins right-hander Jose Berrios also got a no-decision, allowing three runs on eight hits and a walk in five innings. Berrios fanned six in his third career start. Minnesota cracked the scoreboard in the first inning, using back-to-back one-out singles to ignite the rally. Eduardo Nunez and Brian Dozier each singled to put runners on the corners with one out for Plouffe, whose sacrifice fly to center scored Nunez from third. \xe2\x80\x9cI was pleased we at least came out and competed a little better than I thought we have been of late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Twins manager Paul Molitor. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir guy threw the ball awfully well.\xe2\x80\x9d Baltimore got even in the fourth. After a one-out double by Mark Trumbo, Matt Wieters followed with a sharp single past an outstretched Joe Mauer at first, scoring Trumbo.

Although he is a native of Virginia, Justin Verlander has made himself at home when he visits Camden Yards. The 2011 American League MVP and Cy Young Award winner looks to improve upon a 7-0 career mark in Baltimore on Friday when his struggling Detroit Tigers play the second contest of a four-game series versus the Orioles. Verlander will be put to the test versus Baltimore, which overcame a five-run deficit to post its fifth straight victory with a 7-5 triumph in the series opener on Thursday. Chris Davis is enjoying a stellar surge by going 9-for-14 (.643) with one homer, six RBIs and four runs scored in the last three games for the Orioles, who have erupted for 37 runs during their winning streak. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s explosive offense spells bad news for a Detroit club that has surrendered 62 runs in its last 10 contests (1-9). Victor Martinez is a blistering 10-for-13 (.769) with two RBIs and as many runs scored in the last three games and is 4-for-12 (.333) in his career versus Friday starter Chris Tillman. PITCHING MATCHUP: Tigers RH Justin Verlander (2-3, 5.40 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Chris Tillman (4-1, 3.05) Verlander deserved a better fate on Sunday when he scattered three hits and struck out nine over seven scoreless innings of a no-decision versus Texas. The 33-year-old has five quality starts in seven outings, although the two exceptions have been disastrous as he\xe2\x80\x99s yielded seven runs in each to drive up his ERA. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Manny Machado has posted nine multi-hit performances in his last 13 games, but is just 3-for-14 (.214) in his career versus Verlander. Like Verlander, Tillman has also enjoyed success versus Friday\xe2\x80\x99s opposition as he carries a 4-0 career mark while limiting the Tigers to a .183 batting average. The 28-year-old is entering this contest with a flourish, having won his last three decisions while recording four consecutive quality starts. Tillman has struggled with his control, however, issuing four walks in back-to-back outings. WALK-OFFS 1. Baltimore CF Adam Jones has collected seven RBIs and six runs scored during his five-game hitting streak. 2. Detroit 1B Miguel Cabrera has nine hits in his last six contests. 3.

Not so.Beating up on the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen is not a new experience for the Orioles (or anyone else, for that matter). But the Birds did it this time with 10 singles out of 12 hits in the game.The biggest hit of them all was a triple by Jonathan Schoop to score the two go-ahead runs. This is the first legit triple of the year for the Orioles, who are last in the American League in this category. Mark Trumbo has one also, but it was the result of a misplayed\xc2\xa0ball lost in the sun.Schoop needed to bury it deep in the right-field corner to get Pedro Alvarez all of the way around from first base, though he does run well for such a big guy.All in all, it was a gratifying win. It looked like a grievous mistake on Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s part to send Ubaldo out for the sixth, having flirted with certain death all evening and throwing 100 largely ineffective pitches. Indeed, he put two on base who would score.But being at the game, it was very interesting to go into the concourses at the pitching change bringing in Vance Worley. In an impromptu conversation with a series of serious O\xe2\x80\x99s fans, everyone believed the Orioles were going to come back.

The Baltimore Orioles won 7-5. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles defeated the Detroit Tigers 1-0 Friday evening on the strength of Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 200th career home run and the shutout pitching of Chris Tillman.It was obvious from the early innings of this game that even a single run might make the difference, even one swing of the bat from either side. And that was the story as Jones\xe2\x80\x99 homer was the only anomaly in a game of zeroes.Justin Verlander, in spite of his mediocre start this season, was his typical nasty self of old. Often when watching Orioles games, I wonder what it is that is happening at the plate that makes a pitcher difficult to hit, as he may not appear to be very unhittable from a distance or on TV. However, the nasty factor was clearly evident on this evening.But Tillman has his own nastiness, especially when his off-speed stuff is working, which it has been this season. After seven scoreless innings, his 3.05 ERA had dropped to 2.58. This is indeed the Tillman we all hoped for over the offseason and wanted to see this year. And then follow Tillman with an inning each of nastiness from Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Zach Britton, and you have a shutout.And a shutout is exactly what it is going to take to win some of these games where the Orioles run into a top pitcher with his best stuff. The O\xe2\x80\x99s offense can be shut down, and to win these sorts of games, the Baltimore pitching is going to need to be nearly as perfect. The Birds did the same against Tanaka and the Yankees last Thursday. The Orioles have been held to less than three runs on nine occasions this year, while holding opponents to less than three runs a total of 13 times.Adam Jones has hit a lot of big home runs in his career. This was the third ever off of Verlander. The most off any pitcher is four, of which there are three culprits: CC Sabathia, Brandon Morrow, Jeremy Hellickson.The Jones homer that I most remember is the line drive he crushed over the Green Monster off former Orioles outfielder Darnell McDonald in the top of the 17th inning at Boston just over four years ago. This made Chris Davis the winning pitcher. Just 10 days later he broke a 3-3 tie in the top of the 15th inning at Kansas City with a game-winning solo shot off Nathan Adcock.

However I would submit that the virtue of the fact that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse has always been so close is something that carries this team through in tough games.

Unfortunately for O\xe2\x80\x99Day and the Orioles, Wegner was the only person in the ballpark (heck, the only person on planet earth!) who thought the bat didn\xe2\x80\x99t touch the strike zone.

Hitters that good don\xe2\x80\x99t need extra chancesIt\xe2\x80\x99s rare that you see a normally soft spoken guy like O\xe2\x80\x99Day speaking that harshly of an umpire. However it also shows how competitive players are, and how fine the line can often be between winning and losing. O\xe2\x80\x99Day is correct to point out that Wegner didn\xe2\x80\x99t make him throw the two home run balls. But he\xe2\x80\x99s also right in what he said above.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerRight as he may be however, he\xe2\x80\x99s also now opened himself up to being penalized by the league.

The Baltimore Orioles will put the majors\xe2\x80\x99 best home record (16-6) on the line Tuesday when they open a three-game series versus one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s best road clubs in the Seattle Mariners. Baltimore began its seven-game homestand with three straight victories before seeing its season-high seven-game winning streak come to an end following a 6-5 setback against Detroit on Sunday. Adam Jones is riding high with an eight-game hitting streak, going 15-for-34 with four homers, 10 RBIs and 10 runs scored as the Orioles jockey with Boston atop the American League East. Seattle is embroiled in a similar battle with Texas in the AL West, however a three-game sweep at the hands of the Los Angeles Angels cooled the momentum of an impressive 8-2 stretch. Robinson Cano saw his 13-game hitting streak come to a halt in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 3-0 setback to the Angels, but has enjoyed considerable success versus Tuesday starter Ubaldo Jimenez (two homers, 6-for-11) and Baltimore (.335) in his career. The Mariners are opening a six-game road trip looking to improve upon their sizzling 13-6 mark away the Pacific Northwest. PITCHING MATCHUP: Mariners LH Wade Miley (3-2, 4.91 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Ubaldo Jimenez (2-3, 4.87) Miley has righted the ship after a disastrous start to the 2016 season, posting a 3-0 mark with a 3.18 ERA in his last four outings following an 0-2 mark and a bloated 8.04 ERA in his previous two. While his recent results are promising, the 29-year-old was taken deep three times in a 6-4 victory over Tampa Bay on Tuesday and has allowed six homers in his last four. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bode well versus the homer-happy Orioles, against whom Miley owns an 0-2 mark with a gaudy 10.13 ERA in three career meetings. Jimenez escaped with a no-decision on Thursday despite yielding five runs on nine hits in five innings in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 7-5 victory over Detroit. The 32-year-old routinely has encountered issues with his control, walking four batters for the fourth time in his last six outings. Former Oriole Nelson Cruz has struggled mightily against Jimenez, going 0-for-12 with nine strikeouts in his career. WALK-OFFS 1. Baltimore RF Mark Trumbo, who was acquired in an offseason deal with Seattle, is just 2-for-13 with four strikeouts in his last four games. 2. Mariners SS Ketel Marte is just 2-for-17 with four strikeouts in his last four outings. 3. Orioles 2B Jonathan Schoop is 6-for-14 with two homers and 10 RBIs in his last four contests.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThere are quite a few former Baltimore Orioles players who are performing well throughout the rest of Major League Baseball. Could we make an all-former Orioles team out of them?It really is possible, though a couple of positions will be certainly below average. But the pitching staff would actually be quite good and surely above an MLB average.A disclaimer here is that this is not an effort to mock the Orioles or to point out how many good players have gone away and are performing better some other place. This is simply for interest and not to make a statement. Any franchise could probably do the same; it is the nature of the game for players to move around for a variety of reasons. And some perform better in one place or another, also due to a variety of reasons.Let\xe2\x80\x99s begin with a batting order and an imaginary starting lineup (listing each player\xe2\x80\x99s current team) \xe2\x80\xa6Nick Markakis \xe2\x80\x93 RF \xe2\x80\x93 (Atlanta Braves) \xe2\x80\x93 Some Orioles fans will never forgive the organization for not making it happen to keep Markakis after the 2014 season. Concerns about his health and a decline in production have not been realized, as Nick hit .296 with a .370 OBP in 2015. He was hitting about the same this year until a recent 3-for-32 slump has dropped him to .257. But who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be depressed playing for the 9-28 Braves?Steve Pearce \xe2\x80\x93 DH \xe2\x80\x93 (Tampa Bay Rays) \xe2\x80\x93 Everyone loves Pearce and appreciates his time with the O\xe2\x80\x99s. There were some ups and downs. But the Showalter favorite is really performing well for the Rays. Just last night he hit his sixth home run in 23 games while batting cleanup. He is hitting .288 with an OBP of .370.Gerardo Parra \xe2\x80\x93 CF \xe2\x80\x93 (Colorado Rockies) \xe2\x80\x93 He was a great disappointment last year as a late-season acquisition from the Brewers for Zach Davis \xe2\x80\x93 the latter pitching well at the end of last year, though not so this season. Parra is hitting well again now that he is back in the National League, a place he probably belongs and where he leads that circuit currently in doubles with 14.Nelson Cruz \xe2\x80\x93 LF \xe2\x80\x93 (Seattle Mariners) \xe2\x80\x93 As with Markakis, fans resented not seeing Cruz retained. The early performance of Mark Trumbo is helping many forget this loss however. Cruz is hitting reasonably well, though with fewer home runs than three of the O\xe2\x80\x99s. He currently has seven. His average is .265, but tons of walks have his OBP at .363.Danny Valencia \xe2\x80\x93 3B \xe2\x80\x93 (Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s) \xe2\x80\x93 Valencia always could hit a baseball, and he is doing it again now with this sixth franchise. With a .333 average and five homers in 20 games, the A\xe2\x80\x99s are going to have to play him more. His five homers were in the last three games!Mark Reynolds \xe2\x80\x93 1B \xe2\x80\x93 (Colorado Rockies) \xe2\x80\x93 Now with his seventh franchise, Reynolds has the strangest stat line (for him) that you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen!

The first one was back in December of 1965 when the Orioles traded for Frank Robinson. Robinson was the missing piece to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 World Series jigsaw puzzle, winning the Triple Crown and American League Most Valuable Player award in 1966 and helped them win to World Series titles in 1966 and 1970.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first person to admit that I was upset that the Orioles had just traded the best starting pitcher that the Orioles had since Mike Mussina. In exchange for Bedard, the Orioles received Tony Butler, Kam Mickolio, George Sherrill, Chris Tillman, and Adam Jones. Nine years later, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at what the Orioles got for Erik Bedard.First, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at Bedard.\xc2\xa0Much like Frank Robinson, Bedard was expected to be a missing piece to the Mariners after Seattle finished with an 88-74 record during the 2007 season. He simply was never the missing piece. Bedard had a 3.67 ERA in 81 innings over 15 starts in 2008 as the Mariners fell to a 61-101 record.\xc2\xa0In 2009, Erik Bedard once again suffered injuries but at least had a 2.82 ERA in 83 innings over 15 starts. The rest of his career was mediocre at best.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerNext, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at who they got for Bedard. Tony Butler was the Mariners\xe2\x80\x99 12th best prospect when the trade occurred. Butler never pitched in the majors as injuries and ineffectiveness plagued him.Kam Mickolio pitched in the majors for 29 games (23 of them with the Orioles) over four seasons with a career 4.83 ERA. He has found success in Japan, pitching for the\xc2\xa0Hiroshima Toyo Carp and the\xc2\xa0Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.George Sherrill was a setup man for the Mariners when he was traded. He turned out being an effective closer for the Orioles and was even their lone All-Star representative in 2008. The Orioles traded him to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2009 for third baseman Josh Bell and pitcher Steve Johnson. Bell was a huge bust, but at least he hit two home runs off Cliff Lee in the same game. Johnson spent some time with the Orioles before the Mariners signed him last offseason.The two gems of the Erik Bedard trade, Adam Jones and Chris Tillman, are still with the Orioles. Tillman has been the Orioles best pitcher since being called up for good in 2012, even earning an All-Star berth in 2013. He has contributed far more to the Orioles than Bedard ever did to the Mariners.Jones gave the Orioles an everyday center fielder who has emerged as one of the best outfielders in baseball. More importantly, Jones gave the team a vocal leader, something that they had long needed. Even with Manny Machado emerging as arguably the best player in baseball, Jones remains the heart and soul of the Orioles. The Orioles fortunes were reversed\xc2\xa0when Jones boldly declared that he wanted to stay in Baltimore back in 2012.Next: Preaching Patience with Pedro AlvarezWhat can\xc2\xa0fans and teams learn from the Erik Bedard trade? Don\xe2\x80\x99t put all your eggs in one basket like the Mariners did. Sell high like the Orioles did. If a guy isn\xe2\x80\x99t a part of your long-term plans, be open to trading him. The Bedard trade was a brilliant trade by\xc2\xa0the Orioles and they are still reaping the benefits of it. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles Manny Machado and Jonathan Schoop have the best ...', ' Major League Baseball is a big-time business, but that doesn\'t mean there can\'t be some strong relationships built along the way. Together, Manny Machado and Jonathan Schoop have formed a dynamic duo that may be stronger than any other in the majors, and it doesn\'t hurt that they are both really good at what they do.    One has to imagine it is difficult to grow close to anyone in professional sports. It is a short-sighted operation where what you did last year holds little weight if you are scuffling now. On Monday, you could be making the game-winning play only to find yourself released, traded or demoted by the end of the week. So, when a bond forms so tightly between two players, it should be appreciated. Let\'s do that. From another angle Published in Press Box yesterday, former Sun reporter turned Baltimore Baseball writer\xc2\xa0Dan Connolly put together\xc2\xa0a fun piece about the journey the two have gone on together that took them from wiry teenagers in the O\'s farm system to the big-time sluggers they are with the Birds today. It has some things you have heard before: they get at each other about who has the stronger arm (I\'m pretty sure it\'s Machado, but what do I know). And it mixes in some added facts about the conversations they had while taking grounders together in the minors and how they like to frequent steak restaurants around town. Machado even cooks for Schoop from time to time. There are added quotes from J.J. Hardy and Buck Showalter as well. It\'s worth your time to check out.    MASN put together a video last year covering some of the same ground:     Throwing it back The first season the two really played together was in 2011 with the Low-A Delmarva Shorebirds and later the high-A Frederick Keys that same season. That year, they played on opposing sides in the All-Star Futures Game in Arizona with Machado, from Miami, playing on the United States team and Schoop, a native of Curacao, representing the rest of the World. Look at how skinny there were!!           With the Keys, they won both the Northern division title and eventually the Carolina League championship. The following offseason, they were both named to a list of the top 100 prospects in baseball with Machado coming in at number 11 overall and Schoop down at number 82, according to Baseball America.              They made such an impact with the Keys that the club gave a sweet handshake bobble head of the pair to season ticket holders this season. You can admit it, you\'re now jealous of all current Frederick season ticket holders.

These guys are fun and both are playing ridiculously well right now. Schoop is hitting .266/.293/.492. Of major league second baseman, the O\'s man is in the top five in home runs, RBI and slugging percentage, but there is still room to grow as he is fourth among second basemen in strikeouts and has walked just five times in 128 at-bats. At 24 years old, there is no reason to think he won\'t continue to improve.    Meanwhile, the 23-year-old Machado is just ridiculous. He is arguably the best third baseman, both offensively and defensively, in the game. He may soon be thought of as one of the two or three best players in the world. Period. The Miami native is in the top 10 of baseball in batting average (.333), home runs (11), hits (50), doubles (15), slugging percentage (.653) and OPS (1.040). I mean, COME ON! Can you split up Batman and Robin? With the rate at which they are producing, the writing is on the wall. They will need to get PAID eventually, likely with deals that include at lot of zeros at the end. Machado\'s eligible for free agency in 2019 with Schoop following him a season later. It will be tough to manage. Manny may end up with something close to the richest deal in baseball history and Jonathan is a power hitter in a position that historically lacks players with that ability. What are you to do? Those are decisions that Dan Duquette is paid to make, with a lot of help from the Angelos family. As viewers, it\'s easier let them worry about that and just sit back and enjoy these two players having fun on the diamond. (And before you mention it in the comments, Adrian Beltre and Elvis Andrus have a sweet bromance too, but the Machado/Schoop combination is just a bit sweeter) *stats taken prior to the start of games on Monday, May 16, 2016    Thanks for reading!

The Baltimore Orioles beat the Minnesota Twins 9-2. Mandatory Credit: Brad Rempel-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles reliever Brian Matusz has had a difficult 2016 season. Is it time to offer him a change of scenery?After giving up four runs last night, the O\xe2\x80\x99s lefty now has an ERA of 12.00 in his six appearances. Something is not right, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the side from which he pitches. His ball is floating to the plate on a nicely even and gentle trajectory. It\xe2\x80\x99s what I call a \xe2\x80\x9cHit me, hit me!\xe2\x80\x9d ball.It is not as if Brian has never been effective. We all know of the Ortiz domination and that his batting average against numbers with lefties is just over .200. Last year his ERA was 2.94 in 58 games. That is not All-Starish, but it is effective, especially with a WHIP of 1.184.For his career, the ERA is 4.85, and frankly, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I see in him \xe2\x80\x93 a 4.85 ERA sort of pitcher who is occasionally effective in just the right situation.It has been said today by varied Orioles writers that Matusz does not look comfortable on the mound. And so I ask, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen has he ever looked comfortable?\xe2\x80\x9d He is the definition of nerves run amuck on a pitching rubber\xe2\x80\xa6 constantly fussing with his cap and dealing with a dozen other ticks and twitches. The only other O\xe2\x80\x99s pitcher I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen that was more nervous was Jake Arrieta.And raising that name raises the question as to if Matusz is simply one of those guys who might well benefit from a new place of employment \xe2\x80\xa6 new scenery, as we often put it. He has been dealing with trying to \xe2\x80\x9carrive\xe2\x80\x9d for his whole Orioles career. Maybe a new place where that labeling is not part of his expectation package would do him great good.Either that or determine that he is indeed still hurt and needing a rehab assignment. \xe2\x80\x9cBrian, you ARE hurt, right?\xe2\x80\x9d More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryYears ago I was a poor student in grad school with hundreds of other poor students.

That lineup only featured 12 players, so we can fill out a 25-man roster today with a short bench and 13 pitchers.As mentioned in the previous article, this is not done to discredit the Orioles for not retaining any particular player or players. It is merely out of interest in following what has become of former O\xe2\x80\x99s who now compete elsewhere for one of a dozen or more reasons \xe2\x80\xa6 from trades, free agents, to those who have resuscitated dying careers..theiaPostSlider_nav._lower{display:none !important}Related Story: An All-Former Orioles LineupThis caveat is especially necessary in light of the first name today, a pitcher traded away who never came close to his massive potential in Baltimore, but who is now arguably the very best in the business.Starting PitchersJake Arrieta \xe2\x80\x93 (Chicago Cubs) \xe2\x80\x93 The numbers are amazing for the 2015 Cy Young Award winner. In eight starts he is 7-0 with a 1.29 ERA and WHIP of 0.839. He only gives up 4.7 hits per nine innings. Last year he was 22-6 with a 1.77 ERA, doing this with Wrigley Field as his home stadium.Jason Hammel \xe2\x80\x93 (Chicago Cubs) \xe2\x80\x93 He was 15-14 for the Orioles in 2012-13. Right now Hammel is 5-0 with a 1.77 ERA.Rich Hill (Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s) \xe2\x80\x93 He was 3-3 as an Oriole in 2008 with an ERA of 7.80. Having seen him revive his career last season, I would have so much rather seen the Orioles sign him over Gallardo. Right now, Hill is 5-3 with a 2.68 ERA for the A\xe2\x80\x99s.Wei-Yin Chen \xe2\x80\x93 (Miami Marlins) \xe2\x80\x93 Chen will post up every fifth day, even if not always totally effective. Actually, he has not gotten off to a great start this year, currently being 3-2 with a 4.22 ERA.Miguel Gonzalez \xe2\x80\x93 (Chicago While Sox) \xe2\x80\x93 I would rather have put former O\xe2\x80\x99s farmhand Eduardo Rodriguez of the Red Sox in this position, after a 10-6 rookie season in 21 starts with a 3.85 ERA. But he has been out with a knee injury for all of this year so far. Gonzo is still looking to re-create his career and has made three starts, now with a 5.17 ERA.That is a very good staff, especially if Rodriguez could be put there.

But this former O\xe2\x80\x99s group ERA of 2.67 combined is better than any other team. The next best ERA for a rotation is the 3.01 of the Nationals.Relief PitchersAgain, we are going with a total of eight. This group is not as strong as the starters, but it is not bad at all.Andrew Miller \xe2\x80\x93 (NY Yankees) \xe2\x80\x93 Miller is again showing why he is one of the elite relievers in the game. Currently he has a 0.57 ERA, having struck out 28 batters and walking only one!Matt Albers \xe2\x80\x93 (Chicago White Sox) \xe2\x80\x93 Never much with the Orioles, I think this end of 2015 and start of 2016 is lightning in a bottle. But Albers now has a 2.60 ERA.Pedro Strop \xe2\x80\x93 (Chicago Cubs) \xe2\x80\x93 I loved having Strop with the O\xe2\x80\x99s, as he was a big, big part of the revival that happened in 2012. But he lost the touch for a while. Now the man with the crooked hat has a 3.68 ERA, though his WHIP numbers are good at 1.023.David Hernandez \xe2\x80\x93 (Philadelphia Phillies) \xe2\x80\x93 Many O\xe2\x80\x99s fans have likely forgotten Hernandez who was 12-18 with a 4.93 ERA in 2009-10. He has made a comeback with his career and is currently posting a 2.95 ERA for the surprising Phils.Koji Uehara \xe2\x80\x93 (Boston Red Sox) \xe2\x80\x93 Always one of my favorites, at age 41 he might finally be showing some wear and tear. But he still has a 0.848 WHIP and can get people out.Steve Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 (Seattle Mariners) \xe2\x80\x93 The Orioles would have liked to keep Johnson, but simply could not do it. He looks to be coming back now as a reliever, and in a small sample size has the look we remember seeing briefly a few years ago.Francisco Rodriguez \xe2\x80\x93 (Detroit Tigers) \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been a fan of K-Rod, especially with his short stint with the O\xe2\x80\x99s. He\xe2\x80\x99s still not that great, but he\xe2\x80\x99s better than anyone else the Tigers have and is good enough for this bullpen.Andrew Triggs \xe2\x80\x93 (Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s) \xe2\x80\x93 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve written multiple times this year, the Orioles were crazy to DFA Triggs rather than one of multiple others on the 40-man roster.Let\xe2\x80\x99s chart these eight relievers and get a group ERA to compare with the rest of MLB \xe2\x80\xa6NameGIPERERAWHIPMiller1615.211.570.702Albers1717.152.601.096Strop1814.263.681.023Hernandez1718.162.951.091Uehara1615.152.930.848Johnson45.011.801.200K-Rod1513.263.951.317Triggs57.033.860.857Total109107.0332.78\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryThe total ERA of this imaginary bullpen at 2.78 would rank it fourth in all of MLB.

What should the O\xe2\x80\x99s do about him? Should he remain on the team?At this point, one might start to allow thought to creep into their heads regarding\xc2\xa0Ubaldo Jimenez and the Baltimore Orioles. Namely, whether or not he should continue in the vain that he is. Jimenez had a rough outing in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game, although in fairness Seattle came across as on a mission from the get go. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.1 IP, 5 H, 6 R, 4 BB, 4 K.Former Oriole\xc2\xa0Nelson Cruz, smacked a two-RBI single in the first to set the tone for the evening. Cano added an RBI-single in the fifth, as did Cruz once again. Seager\xe2\x80\x99s three-run homer broke the game wide open, and that was followed up by an RBI-double by Cano and topped off by a Cruz home run. At the end of the night, the Birds had fallen 10-0.It\xe2\x80\x99s important to point out that not all of those ten runs were charged to Jimenez. As I said above when I posted his line score, only six of those runs were his.\xc2\xa0Brian Matusz struggled out of the \xe2\x80\x98pen as well. But it all begins and ends with starting pitching, and Jimenez didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it last night.\xc2\xa0Live Feed ubaldo jimenezBaltimore Orioles using optionable bullpen to stay ahead The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Fun facts as the first trip to Yankee Stadium gets underway The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles Clicking on All Cylinders The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: What to Make of Recent Stellar Starts by Jimenez, Miley The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: What's next for Ubaldo Jim\xc3\xa9nez? The Baltimore WireSo at this point what do the Orioles do with Jimenez? The fact is that with a few exceptions, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lived up to his hype \xe2\x80\x93 here in Baltimore at least. Before someone jumps in and just says\xc2\xa0cut him, let me point something out that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said several times over\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6the Orioles can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. It\xe2\x80\x99s just not possible, because it makes zero business sense. MLB contracts are gauranteed, which means that the player gets paid regardless of whether he\xe2\x80\x99s on your roster or not. So if the Orioles were to simply\xc2\xa0cut him, they\xe2\x80\x99d still be paying him. His status of being on the roster is irrelevant.Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s version of cutting someone is designating them for assignment. If the O\xe2\x80\x99s DFA\xe2\x80\x99d Jimenez, he\xe2\x80\x99d still be on the payroll, AND someone else could pick him up \xe2\x80\x93 at the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 expense. (Basically another team could sign him at the league minimum and the O\xe2\x80\x99s would be kicking in the salary at which they signed him \xe2\x80\x93 minus the league minimum.) So even the most ardent Jimenez detractor out there would have to admit that\xe2\x80\x99s not an option.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerBut what is an option? Well he first option is to continue working with him and hoping that he regains his form. The Orioles could also look to trade him, although I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the market would be on him at this point. The most reasonable option however is probably to send him to the bullpen, or to invent an injury so to speak.A lot of teams, including the Orioles, probably over-use the disabled list. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not kid ourselves \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s an option. Nevertheless, Jimenez seemed to indicate after the game that Seattle was just able to\xc2\xa0hit \xe2\x80\x99em where they weren\xe2\x80\x99t fairly well last night (quote courtesy of Brittany Ghiroli of mlb.com):After the first inning, I was able to settle down. In the fifth inning, they were able to find holes. Two out of three hits they got, like the one to [Norichika] Aoki and Cano, they were good pitches. They just found the holes.At the end of the day, I suspect that the Birds will continue working with Jimenez. This involves more than just getting on the field and throwing \xe2\x80\x93 it involves looking at film and trying to find anything mechanically that\xe2\x80\x99s going south. At the end of the day, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that Showalter and his coaches will need to figure out \xe2\x80\x93 what to do with Jimenez, that is.\xc2\xa0Next: When is the 2016 MLB Draft?The O\xe2\x80\x99s will try to take game two of this series with Seattle tonight at Camden Yards.\xc2\xa0Chris Tillman\xc2\xa0will be on the mound for the Orioles, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Taijuan Walker.

The Seattle Mariners endured a tough weekend at home against the Los Angeles Angels but were all smiles by the time they finished up the opener of a road trip at Baltimore on Tuesday. The Mariners will try to keep the momentum going forward when they visit the Orioles for the second of a three-game set on Wednesday. Seattle squandered ninth-inning leads in losses on Friday and Saturday and wasted a solid performance by Felix Hernandez in a 3-0 loss on Sunday but had no such problems against Baltimore. Nelson Cruz homered and drove in five runs and Kyle Seager added a three-run blast while the bullpen backed starter Wade Miley up with three hitless innings in the 10-0 thrashing. The Orioles have dropped two in a row after rolling to seven straight wins and are usually the ones on the other end of home run-aided blowouts. Baltimore managed two hits in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s setback and star Manny Machado went 0-for-3 to extend his slump to 1-for-17 over the last four games. PITCHING MATCHUP: Mariners RH Taijuan Walker (2-2, 2.63 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Chris Tillman (5-1, 2.58) Walker left a start at Houston on May 6 after only two innings due to neck spasms but made his next start against Tampa Bay last Wednesday. The 23-year-old notched nine strikeouts but was charged with a season-high four runs on five hits and three walks in 5 2/3 innings without factoring in the decision. Walker is making his third career start against the Orioles and allowed a total of six runs and 12 hits in 9 2/3 innings over the first two. Tillman is on a roll with four straight wins and five consecutive quality starts. The California native, who was originally drafted by Seattle in 2006, struck out seven and scattered five hits over seven scoreless innings against Detroit on Friday and allowed a total of six runs in his last five turns. Tillman has never lost to his original franchise, posting a 6-0 record with a 2.98 ERA in eight career starts. WALK-OFFS 1. The Mariners activated RHP Joaquin Benoit (shoulder) from the 15-day disabled list on Tuesday and optioned RHP Mayckol Guaipe to Triple-A Tacoma. 2.

Should the Orioles be interested?The Baltimore Orioles\xc2\xa0have a very strong team this season. With that said, the Orioles need to be aggressive around the trade deadline despite not having many valuable prospects. How can they do that? By getting creative. One of the ways that they could do that is by pursuing a bad contract. The San Diego Padres are reportedly shopping outfielder Matt Kemp and since he is due $86 million over\xc2\xa0this season and the next three seasons, he certainly qualifies as a terrible contract.\xc2\xa0More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal11w agoShould the Orioles be interested in him? He\xe2\x80\x99s certainly an intriguing name. Kemp has some good things about his game that could help the Orioles. He also has some awful habits and some very concerning trends that should scare the Orioles away from trading for him. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the good. Despite declining at the plate, Kemp still has great power. He is slugging .500 this season as of May 18, including a .453 slugging percentage at home. That\xe2\x80\x99s impressive considering that Petco Park is generally considered to be a hitter\xe2\x80\x99s graveyard. Matt Kemp\xe2\x80\x99s power would play well at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.Kemp has never played for a team with\xc2\xa0a hitter\xe2\x80\x99s park like Camden Yards before. Sound familiar? It should. If you exclude his brief time as a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks, Mark Trumbo never played in a hitter\xe2\x80\x99s park until the Orioles traded for him.\xc2\xa0More from Rumors1/18 - Baltimore Orioles: Should the Orioles Resign Mark Trumbo? O\xe2\x80\x99 Yeah!1/16 - Baltimore Orioles: Orioles and Jose Bautista were in contact12/9 - Baltimore Orioles Interest in Trumbo & Castillo Pick Up12/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Extension talks with Tillman probably mean nothing12/6 - Baltimore Orioles: What would it take for the Orioles to move Brad Brach?Another good thing about Kemp\xc2\xa0is that he could come at a dirt cheap price. Even if the Orioles talk the Padres into eating some of his contract, the Padres would likely love to get rid of him. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to give up Kevin Gausman, Mychal Givens, or any big names in order to get him.There are also some really bad things about Matt Kemp that the Orioles should consider. The biggest one is that his plate patience is abysmal, even by the 2015 Orioles standards. Kemp is batting .250 on the season. His on base percentage is .264. The Orioles can live with that batting average, but certainly not that on base percentage. That said, the Orioles have been more patient this year, so perhaps the Orioles could help Kemp. But that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a long shot.Another issue is that Matt Kemp\xc2\xa0doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bring much to the table defensively. His UZR (ultimate zone rating) is 0.8 so far in 2016. That\xe2\x80\x99s a small sample size but it\xe2\x80\x99s still his highest and only positive rating since 2009. He\xe2\x80\x99s probably an upgrade over Trumbo in the outfield, but then again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not saying much. Trading for Matt Kemp would likely mean saying goodbye to Pedro Alvarez since Kemp would likely\xc2\xa0be an outfielder, putting Trumbo at designated hitter and rendering Alvarez a surplus part.Probably the biggest issue with him is his contract. It\xe2\x80\x99s an albatross, especially for a guy who is barely above league average as a hitter. An interesting scenario could involve the Orioles sending Ubaldo Jimenez to the Padres and the Padres sending Kemp to the Orioles. Worth noting is that Manny Machado is a free agent after the 2018 season. The Orioles need to re-sign him and Adam Jones after 2018. Kemp\xe2\x80\x99s $21.5 million salary in 2019 might hamper them from doing so.Next: Is Ubaldo Jimenez A Problem?The Orioles need to keep their options open for acquiring talent this season as they make a push for the World Series. Matt Kemp is someone who the Orioles should keep an eye on. If the price is right and the Padres are willing to pay part of his remaining contract to make him go away, Kemp is someone worth exploring.Feel free to voice your opinions in the comments!

TV: 12:35 p.m. ET, MLB Network, MASN (Baltimore) The Baltimore Orioles tend to win when they can get the ball to fly out of the ballpark, and their 57 home runs are a big reason why the team is in first place. The Orioles will try to get more out of the park for the second straight day when they host the Seattle Mariners in the rubber match of a three-game series on Thursday. The Mariners pounded out a pair of home runs in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s 10-0 thrashing to open the series but were out-homered 2-1 on Wednesday as Mark Trumbo and Matt Wieters each went deep for Baltimore. Wieters, who recorded one of the team\xe2\x80\x99s two hits on Tuesday, added an RBI double and scored a pair of runs to lead the Orioles to the 5-2 triumph. Baltimore has won eight of its last 10 to jump back into first place in the American League East and is 17-7 at home. The Mariners are losers of four of five but still sit atop the AL West and will face four consecutive teams with losing records after finishing up with the Orioles. PITCHING MATCHUP: Mariners RH Nathan Karns (3-1, 3.51 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Tyler Wilson (2-1, 2.93) Karns is enjoying a string of four straight quality starts but was held out of the decision in each of the last two. The 28-year-old was reached for three runs on six hits and three walks while striking out five in 6 1/3 innings against the Los Angeles Angels on Friday. Karns spent the last two seasons in the AL East with the Tampa Bay Rays and went 0-1 with a 3.86 ERA in four starts against Baltimore. Wilson has been strong since transitioning from the bullpen into the rotation and has yet to allow more than three runs in an outing. The Virginia native held the Minnesota Twins to two runs on six hits and one walk in seven innings in his last outing on May 11 to earn a win. Wilson is still looking for his first home win of 2016 and pitched a scoreless inning of relief against Seattle last season. WALK-OFFS 1. Mariners 3B Kyle Seager has reached base in seven of his nine plate appearances in the series. 2. Orioles 3B/SS Manny Machado is 1-for-21 in his last five games. 3. Seattle DH Nelson Cruz is 4-for-6 with five RBIs and three runs scored in the series against his former team.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles prevailed over the Seattle Mariners Wednesday evening 5-2 in a game of runners left on base without scoring.This was a game where the box score looks a lot better for the Orioles than the game on the field did to the eye. Starting pitcher Chris Tillman only gave up two runs and four hits in 6.1 innings. And the O\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen duo of Brad Brach and Zach Britton did not yield any more scores.But the Orioles had to deal with a lot of base runners in scoring position all evening long. And it was long and tedious. Though Baltimore pitching only allowed seven hits, four of them were for extra bases. And the Mariners worked four walks as well.At the end of the night, the Mariners were 1-for-12 in situations with runners in scoring position. The Birds looked like a scoring machine by comparison, going 2-for-9.The Orioles were fourth-best with RISP coming into the game last night, having an average of .294, slightly trailing Boston, Texas and St. Louis. On the other hand, Seattle ranked 24th at .234, with the two New York teams as dead last \xe2\x80\x93 the Yankees at .216 and Mets at .208. So the Mariners did nothing to improve their frustrations with scoring opportunities.Helping the O\xe2\x80\x99s have some efficiency was the back-to-back combination of Mark Trumbo and Matt Wieters. Not only did they hit homers one after another, the duo accounted for a total of five of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 eight base hits. Wieters hit a pair of doubles.

But compared to last year, it is categorically improved due to throwing multiple pitches well.So at this moment the Orioles (24-14) actually have the second-best record in all of baseball, trailing only the Chicago Cubs. An odd situation is that the Phillies are only a half-game behind the Nationals, having a 24-17 record. What is unique about this is that they have had 28 more runs scored against them than they have put on the board. By comparison, the Orioles are at a +30 (and the Cubs at +107). ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles hitters confused by rare sunlight, shut down by ...', "" For the first time in what seems like an entire age of the world, the sun shone down on a baseball game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles must not have remembered how to hit in daylight, because they could get almost nothing going against the Mariners as they lost the rubber game of the series, 7-2.    With the loss, the O's once again fall back into a tie - technically ahead by percentage points - with the Red Sox for the AL East lead. That nearly-nonexistent margin is what they will carry with them as they head out west to start a road trip. It's hard to pinpoint the source of the struggle. Joking aside, it's not very likely that the Orioles were actually repulsed by the searing heat of the day star. Perhaps it was the unusual time of 12:35 that threw them off - they just weren't ready to start a game right then. Maybe it's actually that Seattle starter Nate Karns was a bad matchup for them. Or maybe they just had a bad game for reasons that have nothing to do with any of this stuff, or for no particular reason at all. As the cliche goes, every team will win 60 and every team will lose 60 each year - it's what you do with the rest that counts. This could have just been one of the 60 games that the Orioles are sure to lose this year because some days you just lose.    Not that it's fair to pin the entire blame on the offense, either, because even if they had managed a couple more runs under the unfamiliar glowing orb that hung over their heads in the sky, that still would not have been enough thanks to O's starter Tyler Wilson giving up the full Tommy Hunter: Five runs, all earned. Never go full Tommy Hunter.    It wasn't a day-long struggle for Wilson. That's not how he rolls. Even though he gave up a couple of runs through five innings, it still felt like he was cruising because he kept his pitch count low and seemed to be in control of the game. That all fell apart in the sixth inning as Wilson tried to navigate his way through the Mariners lineup for the third time. The third time is not the charm This is the struggle for Wilson, and probably always will be. In his big league career before today, Wilson had allowed batters to hit .333/.391/.462 the third time through the order. His command faltered and a lineup full of lefties punished him for it. That was capped by a three run home run hit by Adam Lind, of all people. Lind is batting .224/.250/.336 this season. Don't give up a dinger to that guy!    It was a cheap home run if ever there was one. Lind poked a fly ball to the opposite field, one that did not clear the fence by much. Had left fielder Joey Rickard made a better jump instead of clumsily crashing into the wall, he might have even been able to make a play on the ball. Instead, Rickard lost his elevation and the ball went beyond him for a home run, giving the Mariners a comfortable margin in the game. Two men were on base for the home run because Robinson Cano led off the inning with a double, and Wilson issued an intentional walk to Kyle Seager rather than continue to try to pitch to him after starting off with a 3-0 count. Wilson finished six innings, if you want to give him that, but that home run hurt. The O's actually made things interesting, briefly, in the eighth inning of the game. Despite a lackluster performance early on in the game, they managed to bring the tying run to the plate with only one out. Bottom of the lineup hitter Ryan Flaherty drew a walk to turn the lineup over. Rickard singled and Machado drew the second O's walk of the inning to load the bases.    Adam Jones and Chris Davis were the next two batters due up once the bases were loaded. That's the way you want to set it up - get guys on for the power threats to swing and see what happens. Jones was swinging, all right... and he swung his way into a ground ball to short that only avoided being an inning-ending double play because it was hit so softly. Instead, it was an RBI fielder's choice. So the tying run was still at the plate in the form of Davis. He was swinging free too, and he swung his way into a pop fly to center field, which would have been deep enough to score a run had there been fewer than two outs. Not much of a consolation, one must admit. Whoa, Bundy A small bit of interest is that Dylan Bundy relieved Wilson and pitched the final three innings of the game. Some part of the master plan to try to stretch Bundy out into a starter again? I wouldn't rule it out. The Mariners tagged Bundy for two runs, scoring in the ninth inning on another cheap home run. Leonys Martin hit a fly ball that barely cleared the fence in right field. This time, it was a bumbling Flaherty who attempted to leap to make a catch and judged his jump poorly so he crashed into the fence before getting any elevation. This ball had no business being a home run and if a real outfielder had been out there it may not have been. Maybe the bright blue sky confused Flaherty. That was a joke just there. So it goes.    For those people who are anxious about Bundy's strikeouts, or lack thereof, he picked up two strikeouts in his three innings of work today. That now gives him nine strikeouts in 16.1 innings of work this year. The extra two runs had no impact on the game's outcome anyway. The Orioles went down 1-2-3 in the ninth inning, sealing their first home series loss of the year. Not much shame in that. The Mariners are good this year and in particular have been very good on the road - they've yet to lose a road series. California awaits. The O's will next be in action against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Orange County, California, United States of America, Earth, on Friday night at the uncivilized time of 10:05pm Eastern. The series opener will see the O's face off against Angels lefty Hector Santiago, with Mike Wright scheduled to pitch for the Orioles.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
05/20/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Popularity of Brooks Robinson', ""Is Brooks Robinson the most popular player in the history of the Baltimore Orioles? In my opinion he is, however what do you think and why?Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 great Brooks Robinson celebrated his 79th birthday this past week. Anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s ever followed the Birds knows who Robinson is, and his effect on baseball. There\xe2\x80\x99s a guy named Schmidt who was pretty decent at the hot corner up the road in Philadelphia as well \xe2\x80\x93 but for my money Brooksie\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest third baseman of all time.If you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me, his 16 consecutive gold gloves will convince you. Schmidt had nine \xe2\x80\x93 which mind you is an unbelievable feat \xe2\x80\x93 but Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s 16 STRAIGHT gold gloves ends the discussion in my view. The knock on Robinson is that Schmidt had better numbers at the plate, and he did. However the \xe2\x80\x9cgreatest ever\xe2\x80\x9d discussion in my view is primarily a defensive one when it comes to a position like third base. All of this is debatable \xe2\x80\x93 this is just my view.But here\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting point; has there ever been a more popular player in Baltimore than Brooks Robinson? I\xe2\x80\x99m of the generation that grew up with the Ripkens, Murray\xe2\x80\x99s, Dempsey\xe2\x80\x99s, and later the Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s of the world. But I can tell you that my Dad, my Uncles, and most relatives of their generation idolized Brooks. And not just for his prowess on the field, but because of who he is.

Call to the PenFirst baseman Jim Gentile was the first big \xe2\x80\x9cstar\xe2\x80\x9d after the Orioles came to Baltimore. My Dad remembers him well, and they loved watching him play. But Robinson was of a totally different quality to anyone who had ever played in Birdland. Furthermore, he seemed to understand what he meant to the community in which he played. There are a lot of current Orioles who seem to get that now, but on many teams that\xe2\x80\x99s just not the case.Furthermore there\xe2\x80\x99s no more humble of a man or an ambassador for the Orioles or the game of baseball than Brooks Robinson. That plays a big role \xe2\x80\x93 the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s a humble person of strong character, and that he was a superstar. You never hear a cross word uttered about Robinson, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily true of a lot of former and current players.However it goes further than that. He helped put Baltimore on the map. The city itself is well-documented as having the appearance of being a stop-over between New York and Washington. When Johnny Unitas and the Baltimore Colts won the NFL Title in 1958, it put the city on the map in a sense.

Two of the brightest stars in the majors square off Friday as the Baltimore Orioles begin a nine-game road trip with a weekend series against the surging Los Angeles Angels. Baltimore shortstop Manny Machado moved to the front of the MVP discussion with a dominant April but surely will be challenged by Angels center fielder Mike Trout, who is heating up following a slow start. Trout began the week by going 7-for-15 with two home runs and six RBI to help the Angels take three of four against the Dodgers in the Freeway Series. The Angels have won six of their last seven games due in large part to the 2014 AL MVP, who is batting .350 with nine home runs, 27 RBI and 26 runs scored over his last 33 games after opening the season with five hits in his first 27 at-bats. Machado has cooled slightly after batting .344 with seven homers in April, but he remains a dangerous threat for a Baltimore team that shares the AL East lead with Boston. The Orioles fell to 17-8 at Camden Yards with Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s 7-2 loss to Seattle, which handed Baltimore its first home series loss of the season. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Mike Wright (2-3, 5.20 ERA) vs. Angels LH Hector Santiago (3-2, 3.42) Wright bounced back from a rough outing against Oakland by yielding two runs on three hits over seven innings in a victory over Detroit on Saturday. The 26-year-old struck out a career-high tying six batters and tossed a career-high 108 pitches while recording his third quality start of the season. Wright made his major league debut against the Angels last season, allowing four hits and striking out six over 7 1/3 scoreless innings in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 3-0 victory. Santiago provided the Angels\xe2\x80\x99 injury-plagued rotation with a welcome boost by pitching eight innings of two-hit ball in a 3-0 win over Seattle on Sunday. The 28-year-old struck out five and flashed an improved fastball after failing to work past the sixth inning in his previous three starts. Adam Jones is 4-for-10 with a home run against Santiago, who is 1-0 with a 2.57 ERA in six career games (three starts) against Baltimore. WALK-OFFS 1. The Angels are 58-39 against Baltimore since 2004. 2. Baltimore LF Joey Rickard has reached base safely in 12 consecutive games. 3.

The reason for it is simple. Pitching on the free agent market is both expensive and volatile. We have seen that for ourselves in the last few years as the O\'s have shelled out for mid-tier (or worse) pitchers\xc2\xa0Ubaldo Jimenez and Yovani Gallardo. Even when signings like that kind of work out for them, and it remains an open question how much either one will work out in the long run, it\'s still not as good as if the team would have been able to draft (or trade for) and develop its own quality pitching corps. Money not spent for rotation answers on the free agent market is money they can use to, say, extend Manny Machado, or keep rather than trade\xc2\xa0Zach Britton as his arbitration raises increase over the next couple of years.    The Orioles can also use extra money to give themselves flexibility to add players like Mark Trumbo, whom another team may give up on when they could have some value to the O\'s.    Not having to give up draft picks is good, too, because that is one more chance the O\'s have to keep adding to their farm system to keep the cycle going. They will not have their top pick this year as a result of signing Gallardo. Pitching on the farm is particularly important for the not-too-distant future of the O\'s because three-fifths of the starting rotation - Jimenez, Gallardo, and Chris Tillman - will be free agents after the 2017 season. They will look to the farm to fill those holes, especially if there are injury problems before then, as they have looked to Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson this season.    Will there be reinforcements for the rotation in a couple of years when the team needs them? That depends. How much of an optimist are you? Triple-A Norfolk Ariel MirandaJoe Gunkel You won\'t find Miranda on MLB.com\'s Top 30 Orioles prospect list, but that\'s because they don\'t count players who were professionals in Cuba, which Miranda was. The 27-year-old lefty debuted in the O\'s system last year and has worked his way up to the Norfolk level. Though at Norfolk, he\'s seen as more of a fringe guy, an honorable mention but not a Top 20 in the O\'s prospect list\xc2\xa0done by John Sickels of SB Nation\'s Minor League Ball back in February.    As a general rule, you don\'t want to draw judgments on a player only by looking at his box scores and stat lines - there\'s a lot of noise in there when dealing with players facing inferior competition, and for some pitchers, with inferior defenses behind them. But sometimes that\'s all there is. Miranda\'s performing decently at the level, a 3.54 ERA in eight starts. He\'s struck out 34 batters in 40.2 innings, though he\'s also walked 16 in the same time. Miranda is a fly ball pitcher, though he\'s only given up three home runs this year. If he keeps up that level of play in the high minors, he\'ll probably at least get a big league shot. Gunkel, 24, is a favorite of mine if only because I like to refer to him as The Gunk. He started his season at Bowie and earned a promotion, but through the small sample size of four Norfolk starts, things aren\'t going well here - a 6.30 ERA. Maybe he needs time to adjust to the International League. Gunkel is the #17 O\'s prospect according to MLB.com. The O\'s acquired Gunkel from the Red Sox when they made a post-DFA trade of Alejandro De Aza last season, so they\'re playing with house money with him and aren\'t out much if he doesn\'t make it. Double-A Bowie Chris LeeDavid Hess These two might be the best shot to fill the hypothetical rotation holes that await starting in 2018. That doesn\'t mean they will, just that, as guys who are at Double-A and enjoying at least some moderate success, they could stay on that trajectory and be ready for a chance at the time the O\'s need to give some guys a chance.    Hess, 22, was the O\'s fifth round pick in 2014.\xc2\xa0ESPN\'s Keith Law is particularly aggressive about Hess, rating him as the #3 prospect in the system:  Hess is a four-pitch guy who doesn\'t have a true swing-and-miss offering but sits mid-90s, bumping 96, with a chance to be a mid-rotation guy if any of the three offspeed pitches improve.  It\'s a big if. He\'s making it work against Eastern League hitters so far this year, posting a 2.33 ERA over seven starts. Something to like is he\'s issued only nine walks in 38.2 innings. Yet he has a 1.34 WHIP even with such a low walk rate. That could be a problem for the future... or a sign that a Double-A caliber defense is giving him BABIP problems that an MLB defense would not. Lee, 23, is interesting by virtue of being a lefty. The O\'s got him from the Astros last year for a couple of international bonus pool slots. A pittance. After that trade, Lee came over and got good results (a 3.08 ERA) while walking a whole lot of people. This year he\'s getting solid results again (3.32 ERA) and he\'s cut that walk rate in half, a respectable 12 walks in 43.1 innings. What makes you raise your eyebrow about Lee\'s 2016 numbers is that he\'s also barely striking anyone out - only 15 on the season. That\'s a 3.1 K/9. A certain O\'s beat writer would tell you it\'s OK Lee\'s not getting strikeouts, but keep this in mind: Lee would be in last place in K/9 among all qualified MLB starters. You need to be able to strike SOME guys out to have any kind of MLB success.    How is Lee making it work? Maybe it\'s the fact that he\'s got a 2.33 ground outs/air outs ratio, meaning he\'s starting to approach Zach Britton level of ground ball tendencies. If a guy was going to weirdly succeed with so few strikeouts, that\'s one way he might do it. Also at Bowie are the enigmatic Parker Bridwell and last year\'s Rule 5 pick Jason Garcia. Neither one presently looks like he\'ll be taking the next step soon. High-A Frederick John MeansTanner Scott These are the two guys on MLB.com\'s top 30 list for the O\'s system.\xc2\xa0Here\'s their capsule on Means:  A 6-foot-3 lefty, Means uses his height to create downhill plane toward the plate, giving him a propensity for generating groundball outs with a 88-92 mph heater that bumps 93-94 mph. His slider, which flashes average at times, has some top-to-bottom tilt to it that gives it curveball-like action, and his changeup has the potential to be Major League average offering as well.  What that adds up to is a 23-year-old who is trying to grind his way up through the system. The Frederick rung of the ladder is going well for Means so far, with 46 strikeouts in 43 innings against only nine walks. His 2.08 ERA is impressive. Probably not worth getting excited for him unless he makes the Double-A jump successfully.    Scott is a lefty reliever who throws 100. Yeah, it\'s crazy! The good news is that batters have only gotten eight hits against him in 20.1 innings pitched. The bad news is he\'s walked 23 guys and has a 7.08 ERA. If he can throw strikes he\'ll get somewhere. That\'s another big if. Low-A Delmarva Ofelky PeraltaGarrett CleavingerBrian GonzalezRyan Meisinger Don\'t mistake quantity for quality here. Peralta, at #14, is the highest placed guy of the bunch of them. If you\'ve been paying close attention to MASN Orioles broadcasts in the last week or so, you\'ve heard multiple mentions of Peralta, including Jim Palmer offering the opinion that Peralta might win this year\'s Jim Palmer Award, given to the O\'s minor league pitcher of the year. A rare Orioles international amateur signing, Peralta is just 19 and enjoying success in full season ball. The 6\'5"" righty is one of those guys who gets the label ""projectable"" applied to him because of an expected improvement to his arsenal when his frame fills out. He\'s doing OK enough already - 35 strikeouts in 32.1 innings, though he has a problem with walks. Don\'t they all? Peralta\'s issued 21 free passes so far. Cleavinger was the O\'s third round pick last year. The 6\'1"" lefty is a reliever who O\'s scouting director Gary Rajsich proclaimed could be the first to debut in MLB out of the O\'s 2015 draft class. May just be a LOOGY but if you\'re like me you\'re feeling like the Orioles could use a new one of those anyway, so maybe Cleavinger will be that guy in time.    Gonzalez was the O\'s top pick in the 2014 draft - when, you\'ll recall, they had no first or second round pick due to signing Jimenez and Nelson Cruz. This is his second year at Delmarva and he wasn\'t good there last year, but he\'s still just 20 and he\'s cut his walk rate and is enjoying good results (2.01 ERA in eight starts). You have to like 37 strikeouts in 44.2 innings - and only two home runs allowed. Meisinger just popped up at #30 on the list yesterday due to Dylan Bundy finally having enough big league service time to lose prospect status. Don\'t get excited about the #30 prospect, especially when he\'s already a reliever in Low-A, but root for him all the same, because he\'s Maryland born. The 22-year-old has struck out 30 guys in 18.1 innings and has a miniscule 0.49 ERA. Elsewhere Hunter HarveyGray FenterPat Connaughton Harvey got some prospect heat after the O\'s drafted him 22nd overall in 2013 - as high as #20 on the Baseball Prospectus 101 before last season. Various injuries, the latest of which was a sports hernia requiring surgery, have kept him from throwing a competitive pitch since 2014. At least they aren\'t Bundy-like injuries to arm and shoulder, and he won\'t have the whole ""must be on MLB roster"" thing any time soon. Fenter was drafted by the O\'s in the seventh round last year and given an overslot signing bonus of $1 million. He had to have Tommy John surgery earlier this year. Dang. Connaughton averaged 4.2 minutes per game for the NBA\'s Portland Trail Blazers this season. I am hoping that inspires him to come back to baseball.    ** There isn\'t another Kevin Gausman here, but then, that\'s not necessarily a bad thing. The O\'s got Gausman as a result of being very bad in 2011. They are not very bad any more. They don\'t get to draft those guys now. That means they have to find less-regarded elsewhere and polish them as best they can. If the Orioles are able to avoid giving up their first round pick in either 2017 or 2018 to sign the next Jimenez/Gallardo-type pitcher, their farm will have done its job as far as pitching is concerned. That, too, is a big if. Not every one of these names has to make it - which is good, because, prospects being prospects, they won\'t. They only need enough to make it to get by.

05/21/2016,"[(""A Look at the Baltimore Orioles' Outfield Options"", 'Back in Spring Training, the Baltimore Orioles had a large number of players vying for time in the team\xe2\x80\x99s starting outfield. Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at how all of those players are doing.At the beginning of Spring Training, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a lot of players in consideration for the major leagues.Then, Joey Rickard showed his stuff, Hyun Soo Kim refused an assignment, and those issues were largely resolved.Mark Trumbo (MLB) \xe2\x80\x93 .306/.355/.599 with 13 HRs (top in AL), 31 RBIs, 5 2Bs, 24 R, 43 Ks. Trumbo has been everything offensively and more for the Orioles. But, the other part to this is that defensively has has been better than a lot of people expected.Joey Rickard (MLB) \xe2\x80\x93 .268/.317/.386 with 4 HRs, 11 RBIs, 6 2Bs, 20 R, 32 Ks. Joey has been the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead-off hitter for much of the year, and has been what the team lacked previously, a consistent on-base threat.Nolan Reimold (MLB) \xe2\x80\x93 .322/.359/.525 with 3 HRs, 8 RBIs, 3 2Bs, 9 R, 19 Ks, 19 H in 64 plate appearances. Reimold has been healthy, and arguably the team\xe2\x80\x99s second-best corner outfielder. He has worked the count, shown power and also played a good job in the outfield, as usual.Hyun Soo Kim (MLB) \xe2\x80\x93 .379/.455/.414 with 0 HR, 2 RBIs, 1 2B, 3 R, 2 Ks, 11 H in 33 plate appearances. Kim has been everything the O\xe2\x80\x99s thought he could, in limited opportunities. The 28-year-old has only played in 12 games this year.Dariel Alvarez (AAA Norfolk) \xe2\x80\x93 .289/.312/.380 with 1 HR, 20 RBIs, 12 2Bs, 12 R, 24 Ks in the most at-bats of anyone on the Norfolk roster (173). Also has six assists with his powerful arm.Xavier Avery (AAA Norfolk) \xe2\x80\x93 .280/.368/.460 with 3 HRs, 7 RBIs, 7 2Bs, 14 R, 30 Ks. Also has 8 SBs in 9 attempts.Christian Walker (AAA Norfolk) \xe2\x80\x93 .236/.293/.437 with 8 HRs, 27 RBIs, 9 2Bs, 22 R, 51 Ks. Walker has looked good defensively, which was the main goal for him this year. However, his batting average is low and the strikeouts are very high so far.L.J. Hoes (AAA Norfolk) \xe2\x80\x93 .229/.317/.276 with 1 HR, 5 RBIs, 2 2Bs, 9 R, 20 Ks, 3 SB in 7 attempts. Hoes really has struggled so far this year in AAA Norfolk.Mike Yastrzemski (AA Bowie and AAA Norfolk) \xe2\x80\x93 .265/.355/.456 with 7 HRs, 30 RBIs, 5 2Bs, 31 R, 29 Ks. Has only played in five games for Norfolk since being called up midway through May.Henry Urrutia (AAA Norfolk and AA Bowie) \xe2\x80\x93 .238/.344/.295 with 0 HR, 11 RBIs, 6 2Bs, 9 R, 24 Ks, 17 BBs. Urrutia reported to Bowie on Friday after being demoted earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 Disappointed with the demotion, Urrutia has struggled in 2016.Julio Borbon (AA Norfolk) \xe2\x80\x93 .250/.316/.290 with 1 HR, 9 RBIs, 0 2Bs, 19 R, 18 Ks, 8 SBs in 12 attempts. Borbon, easily a veteran in AA Bowie, has been who the O\xe2\x80\x99s know he can be, a strong defensive presence with less offense than you would like from a major league outfielder.So, let\xe2\x80\x99s review. Trumbo has been excellent, Rickard has been very good as a lead-off hitter, and Nolan Reimold has arguably been better. Kim has also excelled offensively in his limited experiences.As for the other options, the guys who did not make the major league roster, Alvarez has worked on improving his offense, which is what the Orioles wanted from him in the minor leagues. Conversely, Christian Walker has worked on playing the outfield, which is what the O\xe2\x80\x99s wanted from him in the minors.

But, looking ahead, the team will probably let Mark Trumbo walk and use one of Alvarez, Walker or Yastrzemski in the majors next year. It is also an option for several of these guys to be trade package options if the team pursues pitching by the Trade Deadline.For now, let\xe2\x80\x99s enjoy Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s power and the vast improvement by the corner OFs this year.

Mandatory Credit: Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY SportsMatt Wieters hit a game-winning three-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning to lead the Baltimore Orioles to a 3-1 victory over the Angels.The big blow came at literally the last moment, following a two-out single by Chris Davis and then a two-out walk by Mark Trumbo to set the table.Wieters hit an outside pitch nearly 400 feet over the left-center field wall.

That would be sweet! ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles offense is bad, Ubaldo Jimenez is worse in 10-2 ...', ' Earlier this month, addressing his own struggles this season, Adam Jones gave an interview in which he offered this bit of wisdom: ""It\'s life. It\'s sports. You suck sometimes."" For the Orioles as a team, Sunday was one of those times. They lost to the Angels, 10-2.    There is surely some concrete reason why the O\'s potent offense was held in check by the slop thrown by Angels starter Jered Weaver. The guy averages 82.3 miles per hour on his fastball, according to Fangraphs. That is garbage that doesn\'t belong anywhere near the big leagues.  That\'s been on full display for Weaver so far this year. He entered the day with a 5.76 ERA in eight starts. Yet, just like the Orioles were almost completely stymied last night by Matt Shoemaker - who became the pitcher with the highest ever ERA to strike out 12 batters - they were absolutely horrible against Weaver. Maybe it has something to do with their style of hitting just being particularly vulnerable against a pitcher whose arsenal isn\'t even MLB caliber. This is akin to a chess grandmaster losing to an untrained novice, someone who is somehow so bad that the grandmaster\'s extensive knowledge of strategy and ability to predict high-level moves is neutralized.    Theories to explain struggles against Weaver Perhaps it has something to do with the particular theory cautioned by O\'s manager Buck Showalter before the game began. Showalter noted that Weaver has enjoyed success in day games at home because the combination of Weaver\'s position on the pitching rubber, his arm slot, and the rock pile out beyond center field creates a tough look for the batter: Weaver\'s arm action makes the white ball look to be coming out of the white rock pile.    It\'s a theory that has some truthiness, though as far as I can tell, the only factual basis for it comes from a day game Weaver pitched against the Rangers on April 10. That\'s thin evidence from which to draw any sweeping conclusions, though the Orioles hitters, by playing poorly today, offer another data point to support it. Perhaps in the end it was really just further proof of The Adam Jones Theory of Everything. You suck sometimes. And they did. Weaver held the Orioles to five hits and a walk over seven innings of work, striking out six batters in the process. The guy had a 1.610 WHIP starting the day and the O\'s couldn\'t even muster a baserunner per inning.    The Orioles only output on offense came in the seventh inning, when a little two-out rally was sparked by a Nolan Reimold single. Jonathan Schoop followed with a towering home run into the bullpens out beyond the left field fence - an Oriole finally connecting on a Weaver pitch instead of just getting under it for a weak pop-up. That was Schoop\'s eighth home run of the season. The bad version of Ubaldo, again This was one of those games where the struggles of the Orioles offense almost don\'t even matter because there was an even greater struggle on the part of the pitching staff. You will not be shocked to learn that such a game occurred when the starting pitcher was Ubaldo Jimenez. There has been much more Bad Ubaldo than Good Ubaldo this season. Sunday definitely saw Bad Ubaldo in the game. It was, if you are for some reason inclined to be generous, largely a result of one bad inning that Jimenez ended up wearing six earned runs.    Five of the eight hits that Ubaldo allowed came in that third inning. He has a tendency to turn his opponents into the Gashouse Gorillas from the classic Bugs Bunny baseball cartoon. If you only looked at his BABIP you might think that his .367 allowed was a sign of bad luck. It is atypical for a pitcher, even a struggling one, to have such a high BABIP. If it is indeed bad luck, his luck did not start to turn today. He did little to help his own cause, with poor command doing him in. About all that you can say that\'s positive is that he rebounded from the disaster inning to end up pitching 5.2 innings. When he left the game, the Orioles were losing, 6-0. Dylan Bundy came on in relief of Jimenez. He wasn\'t good either. After retiring Kole Calhoun for the last out in the sixth, Bundy came out for the seventh as well. Starting with a Mike Trout single, Bundy proceeded to give up four hits that plated four runs. Most of the damage was done by a three run home run blasted off the bat of catcher Carlos Perez, who began today with a .179/.228/.274 batting line. The peculiar Orioles tendency to be destroyed by bottom of the lineup hitters continues. Perez was 3-4 on the day and drove in five runs. He raised his OPS 78 points today. Elsewhere, the Red Sox beat the Indians today, so the loss sends the O\'s back into a virtual tie with Boston atop the AL East. They are actually ahead by percentage points, and in fact have the best winning percentage in the American League right now.     Not a bad thing to be able to say as the calendar heads towards Memorial Day. You might feel better about their chances of remaining that high up the standings if Jimenez had an ERA under 6. Presumably, 20% of all remaining O\'s games will be started by him. That\'s a tough handicap. After an off day, the Orioles will next play on Tuesday in Texas, where they can hopefully put together some good games against the reeling Astros. Chris Tillman and Doug Fister are the scheduled starters for the 8:10pm series opener.

You may be tempted to think that it doesn't matter to whom or for what, except you would be wrong.     Matusz was traded to the Braves, and while the O's get back a couple of minor leaguers in the trade, they've also traded the #76 overall pick - the competitive balance pick that can be traded - to the Braves.  Much like they did last year with Ryan Webb, they've sold a pick to dump a trivial amount of salary. This is a frustrating decision. The two minor leaguers the Orioles received in the trade are right-handed pitcher Brandon Barker and left-handed pitcher Trevor Belicek. By some coincidence, these are the last two Braves 16th round picks.     Barker, 23, has been in the Double-A Mississippi rotation this season, putting up some very good numbers. He has a 2.00 ERA in nine starts, striking out 40 batters in 45 innings pitched and walking only 12. It's added up to a 1.044 WHIP - very nice.    Belicek, also 23, began the season in the High-A Rome bullpen where he has also posted some nice numbers. He's struck out 29 batters in 25.1 innings, and also had one outing in Double-A. Baltimore Baseball's Dan Connolly says that Barker will be headed to Bowie, while Belicek will join Frederick.    With this trade, the Orioles will save about 75% of Matusz's $3.9 million salary that was due for the remainder of the season. It's roughly $3 million in savings. That's slightly more than the amount of Webb's salary the Dodgers ate last year. It's a true salary dump. MLB.com's Mark Bowman reports that the Braves are expected to immediately send Matusz to the great DFA in the sky. Must be kind of embarrassing, though probably not as much as having an ERA of 12.00. The slot value on the 76th pick is $838,900. The Orioles will have that much less money to spend now, and one fewer chance to draft a player who might ever turn into anything. Was that pick likely to ever turn into someone? No, not really. It's the principle of the thing.    If someone was inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to the O's, who have now pulled this caper in two straight seasons, they would probably point out that either Barker or Belicek could be better than whoever the O's might pick at #76. The possibility does exist, it must be said. With apologies for tooting my own horn, I put forth the O's as a team who might trade their pick to the Braves about a month ago and suggested Matusz as the player most likely to fit that bill. Here we are. Being right about this is not fun. Stop trading picks!  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('For the Orioles, a tale of two bullpens - Camden Chat, a ...', ' In recent seasons every Orioles fan and commentator rankles themselves over the amount of innings the starting rotation goes. The poor starting pitching, it is said, puts too big of a strain on the bullpen which inevitably leads to blown leads and mounting losses. It is true that poor starting pitching will lead to more losses. But Buck Showalter\'s mastery of bullpen management gives the team an edge.    Old school bullpen orthodoxy (the funny thing is that this bullpen specialization is a relatively recent trend in baseball) states that you have a 7th inning pitcher, an 8th inning pitcher, and a closer for the 9th inning. Most likely there is a LOOGY (Lefty One Out Guy), a long reliever, and a couple of middle relievers to bridge the gap to the 7th inning guy. The strict roles give the manager a playbook to work from and gives the player nice roles to fill. The closer is the closer because he\'s the closer and since he\'s closer he comes in only in the ninth inning. The new school bullpen orthodoxy states that your best pitcher should come in when it matters most and not when the blueprint dictates. This bullpen ideology comes from the idea of leverage. Baseball games often come down to a few high wire moments. Most pitches and plate appearances occur in situations where the game is not on the line.    For instance, Saturday night\'s win against the Angels. Matt Wieters was up when the Orioles were down one run, with two outs, and runners on first and second. A hit in that situation greatly alters the chances of the Orioles winning. An out means a loss. This situation had a leverage index of 5.5.    To calculate leverage index the base-out situation, inning, and score are all taken into account and the outcomes of the plate appearances are given a probability. The probable outcomes all effect the win expectancy of the game. The change in win expectancy is then set as the denominator. This produces a leverage index score. One is considered average, below 0.85 is considered low leverage, and above two is considered high leverage. So as you could guess, that plate appearance from Matt Wieters was very high leverage as the game essentially swung on the outcome of that plate appearance.    What Buck Showalter does is split the baby between the old school and the new school. While there are certainly roles in the Orioles bullpen, they are flexible. Zach Britton is the closer and he comes in with leads in ninth or tie games at home in the ninth. He gets his saves. Otherwise, the bullpen floats around. Not only that, Showalter is great at resting guys while also getting the relievers the work they need. He rarely asks pitchers to go three straight days nor does he allow them to go three straight days without getting into a game. What allows Showalter to do this is that he gives himself two bullpens. There is the high leverage bullpen and the low leverage bullpen. Below is a table illustrating my point. (Stats do not include Sunday\'s game)       Pitcher Low Leverage Medium Leverage High Leverage   Zach Britton 4.2 IP 6.2 IP 6.2 IP   Darren O\'Day 5.0 IP 7.2 IP 3.2 IP   Brad Brach 12.1 IP 6.2 IP 4.1 IP   Mychal Givens 5.2 IP 7.0 IP 4.2 IP   T.J. McFarland 11.1 IP 1.1 IP 0.2 IP   Dylan Bundy 13.0 IP 1.2 IP 1.2 IP   Vance Worley 19.2 IP 3.2 IP 0.1 IP   Brian Matusz 4.2 IP 1.1 IP 0.0 IP    As you can see, Buck Showalter avoids using his best relievers in low leverage situations as much as possible. Britton, O\'Day, Brach, and Givens (The High Leverage Bullpen) have 27 low leverage innings between them. Bundy, Worley, Matusz, and McFarland (The Low Leverage Bullpen) have 48.2 low leverage innings between them. The High Leverage bullpen has thrown 86 percent of the high leverage innings. You\'ll also notice that the best relievers are the ones in the High Leverage Bullpen. When the game is on the line, the Orioles send their best pitchers out to get the job done. Brad Brach serves as a semi-go between usually pitching more than one inning in his outings and serves more as a fireman (bridging the starter to the back end of the bullpen). Furthermore, Showalter is not afraid to ask pitchers to go multiple innings or bring in a member of the high leverage team in the sixth inning if the situation dictates. The typical baseball game is pretty boring. Most innings are low leverage innings and most pitches are low leverage pitches. Games often swing on a few plate appearances in key situations. The high leverage outs matter most and when the game is on the line you want to have the best pitcher in the game no matter what inning it is.    While Buck Showalter has not totally eschewed the ""old school"" bullpen orthodoxy his ability to lean on certain pitchers when the outs mean less and others when they mean more gives the Orioles an advantage. It means when the outs matter most the right guy is in there. It also means that bullets aren\'t being wasted on on the high quality arms getting outs when they don\'t matter.

Tillman has a 1.62 ERA during the stretch and allowed one run or fewer in three of the five outings. Tillman has helped the Orioles win 10 of their last 14 games and Baltimore possesses the best record in the American League. The Orioles opened a nine-game road trip by winning two of three against the Los Angeles Angels but were routed 10-2 on Sunday. Houston has lost four consecutive games and scored just five runs in the span as it continues to experience an underachieving season.

Given his inconsistencies both this year and over the years, I suspect that most fans will wish him well, but not be overly upset that he\xe2\x80\x99s gone. However keep in mind that Matusz was a first round draft pick in 2008\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6he came up in 2009 with the hopes that he could be a power southpaw starter for the Orioles. He had some flashes of being able to do just that, however in reality it never materialized. Make no mistake about the fact that there were times Matsuz was effective in the bullpen the past couple of years. However there were probably more times when he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.What the Birds lose in Matusz is a good clubhouse and community guy. Most fans probably don\xe2\x80\x99t care too much about that, however for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth the Orioles do. How you\xe2\x80\x99re represented in the community does matter \xe2\x80\x93 especially in a community such as Baltimore. Furthermore whether or not someone\xe2\x80\x99s a good clubhouse guy or not also makes a difference.

However the good news is that the Orioles got good return in two young minor league pitchers \xe2\x80\x93 something that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been needing. We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard so much about them needing to re-stock their farm system\xe2\x80\xa6this helps.And for the record, the Orioles all but won this trade before anyone actually stepped on the field in a sense. There are reports that Atlanta is goin to designate Matusz for assignment. If that\xe2\x80\x99s true, odds are he\xe2\x80\x99ll never even appear in a game with his new team. That means that Atlanta traded two minor league pitchers for a competitive balance draft pick and for the responsibility of taking on Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s salary. Interesting to say the least.If in fact he\xe2\x80\x99s DFA\xe2\x80\x99d, that would mean that he could sign with any other team. Perhaps the Orioles might consider bringing him back? A lot of folks are going to scoff at that, however keep in mind that if that happened it would be a next-to-no-risk move. Atlanta would be paying his salary, and the Orioles could just pick him up and if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out at some point (or if they needed a roster spot) they could DFA him. Again, with Atlanta on the hook for his salary, there\xe2\x80\x99s very little risk.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerI don\xe2\x80\x99t see that happening, however. I suspect that Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s time in Baltimore is over. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not totally a knock on Matusz in a sense, because I do believe that the organization is guilty of mismanaging him in the first couple years of his career.

Minnesota Twins defeated the Baltimore Orioles 4-3. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles had a very active Monday with a variety of deals relating to pitchers, including the trade of Brian Matusz to Atlanta.At the end of the day, the Orioles have one less pitcher in the organization (Matusz) along with the remainder of his $3.9 million contract, one less draft pick (trading the 76th overall selection), and two less international signing bonus slots.On the other hand, they have gained four pitchers for the minor league system \xe2\x80\xa6 a veteran who could possibly make a comeback, and three young pitchers with some decent statistical numbers.You can put me down as calling this an overall good day. It will take some time to see how it all plays out on every end. If Matusz becomes the next iteration of a Cy Young winner like Jake Arrieta, this will look dumb. But there is no reason to bet on that one. And maybe none of these four new arms in the system ever contribute in Baltimore, but right now, we can\xe2\x80\x99t say that Matusz is helpful or will be anytime soon. The money saved can be better used elsewhere as well.The Brian Matusz move is not a total surprise, especially to us here at The Baltimore Wire. We suggested just days ago that he could be a guy who could benefit from a change of scenery..theiaPostSlider_nav._lower{display:none !important}Related Story: Change of Scenery for Matusz?It is pretty great that Dan Duquette was able to get something in return for Matusz. Though you hate losing a fairly high draft pick, the return involves a couple of arms who really could compete, doing so even sooner than a draftee. And when Matusz was gone in the past, the Orioles did not miss him too terribly. Remember his eight-game suspension last year? The O\xe2\x80\x99s went 7-1 with the 24-man roster.Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about these moves in order of how the dust settles (most likely), going from the top (the O\xe2\x80\x99s) and down to \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d ball\xe2\x80\xa6At this moment of writing, the word seems to be that Ashur Tolliver will take the open spot on the 25-man roster, moving up from Bowie. The 28-year-old lefty has been a good soldier in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 system since being a fifth-round pick out of Oklahoma City College in 2009. He has never pitched above AA, but has had two good seasons there over the past two years. Currently he has a 2.42 ERA in 18 games and 26 innings of work.The Orioles picked up veteran lefty Brian Duensing, the 33-year-old lefty who has had a decent career with the Twins in particular. He opted out of a contract with the Royals and was subsequently released. His AAA numbers aren\xe2\x80\x99t bad, with lefties hitting only .219 off him and righties even worse at .209. Will we see him in Baltimore? I\xe2\x80\x99m not expecting it, but neither is it a crazy potentiality. But his career 4.13 ERA and WHIP of 1.384 would lead me to be more excited about advancing some minor league players instead. Duensing will be at AAA Norfolk.The first of two pitchers coming back from the Braves in the Matusz deal is Brandon Barker, who will be headed for Bowie. In AA for the Braves, the right-hander has pitched 45 innings this season with a 2.00 ERA. The peripheral stats are all very good as well, with a WHIP of 1.044. \xc2\xa0 This is good stuff!The other returnee for Matusz is lefty Trevor Belicek, like Barker a 23-year-old. In only 26 total minor league games from rookie ball through AA, he has pitched very well both as a starter and reliever. The total ERA is 2.43 with a 1.055 WHIP. This is also good stuff! He will be sent to the Frederick Keys where I will look forward to meeting him.

This Venezuelan is only age 23 but is already in his seventh season of professional baseball. The numbers are a mixed bag of stuff over the years, and honestly all that is of interest is what has been done lately. Those stats are pretty good and come from the Midwest League where he has a 2.87 ERA in eight starts with a 1.170 WHIP. He\xe2\x80\x99s a long way from Camden Yards, but presuming he is put into the capable tutelage of Blaine Beatty with the Shorebirds, the day may come where he is a star and you will be naming your first-born Franderlyn rather than Cal or Brooks. \xc2\xa0<UPDATE: Romero is going to Frederick.>So this was a good day in my humble opinion.

Left with few choices, Bundy then gave Springer and Altuve intentional passes to load the passes for Carlos Correa. The phenom laced a 94 mph fastball up the middle to score Kemp and give the Astros the 3-2 win after 13 innings. Stats -Jones, Davis and Trumbo combined to go 1-for-17 with one walk, eight strikeouts and nine runners left on base.    -Both bullpens were really good: Houston threw 7.1 scoreless innings with six pitchers. For Baltimore, Mychal Givens, O'Day and Brach combined for five scoreless frames. Givens was especially impressive, tossing 2.1 innings and striking out four batters. -The Orioles hitters struck out 19 times. Yeah, it was a 13 inning game, but good lord! -Colby Rasmus was thrown out in the sixth inning while arguing balls and strikes. Tomorrow It is the middle game of this three-game set. Tyler Wison (2-2, 3.68 ERA) has been announced as the starter for the Birds. The Astros will counter with righty Collin McHugh (4-4, 5.13). First pitch is set for 8:10 p.m. ET at Minute Maid Park.

05/26/2016,"[(""Orioles' front foot turning into their Achilles heel ..."", ' Who doesn\'t love a majestic, Icarus-too-close-the-sun mortar shot into the bleachers, only to be dropped by the average athlete beyond the fence? I know I do. I love it all. The dynamite echo of the bat, gazing admiration, obligatory trot, and run(s) on the scoreboard. And since 2012, the Orioles have patented the process.    Even now, through the first 46 games, the Orioles aren\'t allowing their hands to fall idle. Manny Machado is second in the American League in home runs with 13, as is Mark Trumbo. Chris Davis has a quiet 10 dingers, whereas Jonathan Schoop\'s 8 bombs have been just a bit grander. The sum of the parts equate to 65 home runs, tied for most in baseball with, as a I shrug in confusion, the Tampa Bay Rays. Extending further, the O\'s are first in HR/FB% (15.6%), fourth in ISO (.187) and seventh in wRC+ (108). The Orioles are built to score runs, and mostly, they have. However, as purposeful the Orioles\' lineup has become, those same run-creating hands that paved the club\'s 26-18 start have slowly fallen into the devil\'s workshop.    This past week, the Orioles\' offense has been drubbed into the fetal position by the likes of Wade Miley, Nate Karns, Matt Shoemaker, Jered Weaver, Doug Fister and Collin McHugh, with the only win in the current AL West road trip coming via Matt Wieters\' 9th inning birthday home run. But it\'s been bad. Like the Orioles are acting out a Zack Snyder directed screenplay bad.    Not only have the Orioles struck out 37 times in the last 22 innings, but the prodigious production of bat flatulence has equated to 78 strikeouts over the previous eight games. That is #ungood baseball. Naturally, probably hopefully, the Orioles understood the kind of peaks and valleys that a lineup centered around Manny Machado, Adam Jones, Chris Davis, Mark Trumbo, Pedro Alvarez and Jonathan Schoop could face. Yes, the Orioles bring the boom, and they bring it often. And yet there are stretches, such as this current debauchery the O\'s falsify as hitting, that were very much realistic.    For example, there is Adam Jones, whose plate approach of ""F*** it, let\'s see what happens"" has magnified the current team-wide issue.         This is Jonesy\'s zone profile in 0-0 counts since last Tuesday. There are an abundance of swings because Jones\' hunger is everlasting, but this solely accounts for first pitch breaking balls and off-speed pitches. Swinging everywhere and at everything, his BABIP on such swings has accounted for an average of .000. That\'s right. Jones has put two baseballs in play in regards to the plot above, dooming himself into the abyss that is the 0-1 count. A constant victim of tipping his intentions to the opposing pitcher, Jones has been an automatic out, and even more dumbfounding is his maverick need for swing.             <picture class=""c-picture"" data-cid=""site/picture_element-1494653363_5342_2899"" data-cdata=\'{""picture"":true,""dynamic_picture"":false,""convert_picture"":false}\'>            <img srcset=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jk5EN6CY8p4b6MmxGpZtU8rR734=/0x0:718x404/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6549219/Av8bvzo%20-%20Imgur.gif 320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wndp47DPym7gXdoWNMtxH-_4ZyQ=/0x0:718x404/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6549219/Av8bvzo%20-%20Imgur.gif 520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uloVcQ49DHvYgpM4_zcEiz2lmCw=/0x0:718x404/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6549219/Av8bvzo%20-%20Imgur.gif 720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8rC_BhKY1F1toV62lQaoVZ1XrCQ=/0x0:718x404/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6549219/Av8bvzo%20-%20Imgur.gif 920w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AzGDkKbT8dpN4UVL0chOZW90-vc=/0x0:718x404/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6549219/Av8bvzo%20-%20Imgur.gif 1120w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Euy0qZqRQ2tzssvvw639A4X4NvU=/0x0:718x404/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6549219/Av8bvzo%20-%20Imgur.gif 1320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hg9IEoeyB0CL6DJy0g7MM_1A_tU=/0x0:718x404/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6549219/Av8bvzo%20-%20Imgur.gif 1520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ThWk06bKPXa5vW5MGKn7Figfzdo=/0x0:718x404/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6549219/Av8bvzo%20-%20Imgur.gif 1720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FC6tZ0dsCrlHMtzSlJpvgBNCd5w=/0x0:718x404/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6549219/Av8bvzo%20-%20Imgur.gif 1920w"" sizes=""(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CyVbGuRw0X_TZIW7gaIEMm1ctUQ=/0x0:718x404/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6549219/Av8bvzo%20-%20Imgur.gif"">  </picture>         In this at-bat, Jones was unable to connect on a pair of fastballs before falling victim to McHugh\'s hammering curveball. Houston\'s crafty righty throws his curveball 26% of the time, but the Orioles eagerness to prove him wrong allowed him to sequence the pitch 38% of the time, inducing a whiff rate of 34.2%. Of the 20 swings on McHugh\'s curveball, only two resulted in action behind him. Just as McHugh proved to Jones, the formula was simple. Had it not been for a squirter sneaking by Evan Gattis and a dinking single by Pedro Alvarez, McHugh likely escapes the 6th inning without angst. While Jones may be the most whiffing enemy No. 1, his ineptitude isn\'t alone. It\'s easy to turn a cheek when watching Chris Davis hit. You take the swings and misses because there is usually a ball in the stands on the other side of a Crush rainbow. And sometimes there are at-bats where he, though you know he isn\'t, just looks disinterested and whiffs at three pitches, walking back to the dugout before his caveman chaw wad kicks in. It is what it is.         The thing is, Davis, like Jones, thrives on prediction rather than reaction, and as you can see, he hasn\'t been one to predict much of anything over the last week. Just as his free-swinging comrade before him, Davis has been seduced by first-pitch breaking balls and off-speed pitches, and like Jones, has not produced a single base hit, or ball in play, to show for his efforts. Surrendering to the 0-1 count has meant a lot of succeeding fastballs up in the zone, pitches that tend to sneak away from Davis\' uppercut swing, leaving him befuddled the rest of the way.    Compounding with Davis and Jones are Machado and Trumbo, who have seemingly taken the same approach of muscling at sliders down and away. Manny, though likely brief, has caught the plague while Trumbo\'s disciplined start has evaporated into his reputable self. The big picture isn\'t necessarily the swings and misses, because this roster was constructed with the blueprint of Buck Showalter\'s ""damage-to-contact"" mantra. It\'s understood. There are going to be plenty of frustrating swings sooner and later, but succumbing to defeat after one pitch inflates the Orioles inherent weaknesses. Yes, the Orioles want to hit fastballs, but to date, the O\'s have seen the second-fewest fastballs (53.3%) so far in 2016, a 2.9% decline to 2015. Changeup, slider and curveball rates have risen as a result, and if this past week is any reassurance, the differing rates are only going to continue to surge unfavorable to the Orioles. Maybe this week is an aberration. After such a torrid start, the Orioles could have been due for a reality check. Could it be the the fact that aside from Hector Santiago and Taijuan Walker, the Orioles were just pitched to with precise, efficient caution? Perhaps, but it doesn\'t take away from the Orioles being borderline unwatchable over the last eight games. With the way the pitching staff continues to look like 2014, and the Red Sox having been body-snatched by the Monstars, the Orioles would be wise to figure out how to reclaim the weapons at their disposal.    The Greek warrior Achilles was turned mortal, and ultimately dead, by a poisonous arrow lodged at the base of his foot. If the Orioles are unwilling to change, their Achilles heel won\'t be the swings and misses. It will literally be the strain caused by the  whiffs from incessant lunging out over the plate. That\'s a story no Baltimore Homer wishes to write.

Hardy \xe2\x80\x93 15%, Hyun Soo Kim \xe2\x80\x93 5%.As we have noted several times here on The Baltimore Wire, the strikeout totals for the Orioles have not been unique or even near the top of the league. They have been about average, but the last two evenings look like there could be a change coming. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles set record for strikeouts in a series in 4-2 loss ...', ' Give this to the Orioles: When they bring their considerable resolve to a task, they break all known records in reaching that goal. Unfortunately for Orioles fans, the task in the Astros series has been ""strike out as many times as possible,"" which they continued to do in the finale, a 4-2 loss on Thursday night.    No one in the history of baseball had ever done what the Orioles have done in this series. After striking out 19 times on Tuesday night and 18 times in Wednesday\'s game, the O\'s added another 15 strikeouts in this game, setting a new record for most strikeouts in a three game series. That adds up to 52 strikeouts. The old record was 47. It was an impressive level of futility for the team once again. Houston starter Lance McCullers was almost incapable of throwing the ball near the strike zone at times. He walked six batters and threw so many pitches that he had to leave the game after five innings after having thrown 108 pitches.  Still the Orioles managed to strike out ten times against McCullers. In his fifth and last inning, the six batters he faced alternated walks and strikeouts. How do you even do that? Very carefully, I suppose.    One hit is a lonely hunter Oh, and the Orioles only got one lone hit against McCullers. Are you serious with this right now, Orioles? They seem to be all-too-serious. It\'s crazy. The lone hit was a solo home run, a Houston-appropriate rocket off the bat of Mark Trumbo for Trumbo\'s 14th of the year.    This was not a game where one lone solo home run would be enough. O\'s starter Kevin Gausman gave up three home runs himself. The Astros did not score any runs that did not come via a home run off of Gausman.  George Springer hit two solo shots, one to lead off the game and one in the fifth inning. So did Luis Valbuena, whom the Orioles have inexplicably turned into Barry Bonds in this series. Valbuena homered in each of the three games. The guy was batting .197 before the series began.    Gausman himself pitched for only five innings as well, giving up four runs on five hits while walking a batter. He struck out seven. Other than the homers... but then, that\'s like asking Mrs. Lincoln, ""How was the play?"" For all of that, the O\'s managed to battle back to get the tying run to the plate before the game ended. Hyun Soo Kim, the game\'s #8 batter, led off the inning with a Kim-tested infield single, a little chopper that was just out of the reach of Astros second baseman Jose Altuve. This was Kim\'s second hit of the game. He was 2-4 on the night. Play this man some more!    Neither of the next two batters advanced Kim anywhere, although pinch hitter Pedro Alvarez at least made solid contact on a ball - just solid contact that went right at the left fielder. A moral victory in a strikeout-laden series, perhaps? No. Moral victories are for losers.  Joey Rickard popped out for the second out, ending any chance of the O\'s to pull themselves up to 17 strikeouts for a 19-18-17 strikeout series. A real missed opportunity there. It all came down to Manny Machado, who the Astros wanted nothing to do with tonight. They walked him three times - though none were intentional tonight. Machado hit a fly ball over Springer\'s head in right field that somehow allowed Kim to score even though Machado only got a single. Well, going on contact with two outs probably helped him. So Chris Davis came up to the plate representing the tying run. Astros reliever Ken Giles, who drew the ninth inning duty, has been bad this year, allowing four home runs in only 19.1 innings heading into tonight. Davis hits home runs, sometimes. Not tonight. He grounded out weakly to Altuve and the game was over. Swept into the garbage can With the loss, the Orioles were on the wrong end of a sweep for the first time this season. With the way they\'re hitting right now, it\'s impressive it took them until almost Memorial Day to get swept, really. They also have a season-long four game losing streak.    It\'s not the end of the world, losing four straight games. Even a good team will have losing streaks. The division winning Orioles of 2014 had three different four game losing streaks in the regular season, although they never lost a fifth in a row at any point. Still, that doesn\'t make it a whole heck of a lot of fun to watch these games right now. On the MASN broadcast of the game, Jim Palmer was barely able to contain his disgust and incredulity at what he was witnessing with all of the strikeouts. ""It\'s like they\'ve never seen a breaking ball before,"" Palmer said at one point in the midst of the Orioles hitters flailing away at junk. One bright spot in the game is that minor league grinder Ashur Tolliver, called up on Tuesday, got to make his big league debut in front of family and friends. His cheering section was caught on the MASN cameras and adorably excited for Tolliver.  Tolliver, the lefty replacing Brian Matusz, retired four of the five batters he faced, issuing only a walk. Tolliver also struck out three batters. Some of them were even right-handed. You can stay, Ashur. As things stand right now, the Orioles have two members of the 2009 draft in their bullpen - Tolliver (fifth round) and Mychal Givens (second). Not bad if they are getting some small contribution from the Matt Hobgood-fronted draft that, for a long time, seemed like a complete waste.    Another piece of good news is that the Red Sox lost to the Rockies on Thursday night, so the O\'s don\'t fall any farther behind in the division. But they really need to (if I might borrow an Adam Jones-ism) clean their ish up. The Cleveland Indians await the Orioles next as the O\'s head to their third city in this three time zone-spanning road trip. Mike Wright is the scheduled starter for the O\'s in the 7:10 opener, with Trevor Bauer starting for the Indians.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Two teams streaking in different directions square off on Friday as the Cleveland Indians host the Baltimore Orioles in the opener of their three-game series. Cleveland has sandwiched five- and three-game winning streaks around a three-game slide and enter the matchup with Baltimore having captured the final three contests of a four-game set against the American League Central-leading Chicago White Sox to conclude a 6-3 road trip. The Indians are hoping Rajai Davis breaks out of his slump as the leadoff hitter is 1-for-18 over his last six games, with the hit being a home run. Baltimore kicked off its nine-game road trip with a pair of victories over the Los Angeles Angels but has lost four in a row since, including a 4-2 setback at Houston on Thursday that completed a three-game sweep. The Orioles have struggled to score on the trek, producing three runs or fewer in each of their last five contests after beginning the trip with a 9-4 victory. Making contact at the plate will be imperative for Baltimore, which has struck out 73 times over its last five games \xe2\x80\x93 including 52, a dubious major-league record for a three-game series \xe2\x80\x94 against the Astros. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Mike Wright (2-3, 4.97 ERA) vs. Indians RH Trevor Bauer (3-2, 4.31) Wright has allowed two earned runs in three of his last four starts, including a no-decision at the Los Angeles Angels on May 20 in which he gave up four runs overall on five hits and three walks in 5 1/3 innings. The 26-year-old native of South Carolina has done a good job of keeping the ball in the park this season, permitting four home runs over 41 2/3 frames after serving up nine in 44 2/3 innings last year \xe2\x80\x93 his first in the majors. Wright, who never has faced Cleveland, is 1-1 with a 5.94 ERA in three road starts this campaign. Bauer will be making his sixth consecutive start after beginning the season with six relief appearances in which he surrendered six runs over 11 1/3 innings. The 25-year-old Californian suffered his second straight loss Saturday at Boston, where he yielded four runs and eight hits in five frames. Bauer has yet to defeat Baltimore in his career, going 0-2 while allowing eight runs and 11 hits \xe2\x80\x93 four homers \xe2\x80\x93 over 11 1/3 innings in two starts. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles SS/3B Manny Machado is 2-for-5 lifetime against Bauer, with both hits being solo homers. 2.

05/28/2016,"[('The Real Baltimore Orioles Return to Baseball', 'May 24, 2016; Houston, TX, USA; Baltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones (10) celebrates short stop Manny Machado (13) home run against the Houston Astros in the sixth inning at Minute Maid Park. Mandatory Credit: Thomas B. Shea-USA TODAY SportsAfter a horrendous series in Houston, the real Baltimore Orioles returned to the field on Friday evening to defeat the Cleveland Indians 6-4.If there was ever any doubt that Buck Showalter is a genius, last night proved it with Adam Jones being put into the leadoff spot. Very few Orioles fans (who are honest) when seeing the posted lineup before the game were saying, \xe2\x80\x9cExcellent. This is just what we need \xe2\x80\x93 Adam Jones hitting leadoff!\xe2\x80\x9dWhy would anyone think that Jones belongs at the top of the order? He was hitting .223 with an OBP of .282!\xc2\xa0 He has not done it since 2010, and his career numbers in 21 starts are a .240 average with an OBP of .284. But Jones led off the game with a hit and went 3-for-5.Manny Machado came back into his body from wherever he has been lately and cracked four base hits. And Jonathan Schoop got a critical two-out hit in the bottom of the first inning to drive in two runs, showing the sort of hitting that has been entirely missing of late. And finally, Mark Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s home run proved to be the difference.What a difference a day makes. This new Orioles team looked more like the one we saw opening week of the season \xe2\x80\x93 not swinging wildly at pitches and making the pitcher come to them.Beyond that, the defense returned. Particularly making nice plays were the middle infielders, as Buck commented after the game, \xe2\x80\x9cThe middle guys on the diamond made great plays on both sides of the ball.\xe2\x80\x9dThe win moves the Orioles back to within a game of first-place Boston, who lost to the Jays 7-5. The victory was also the first in the career of Dylan Bundy. There will be more.

Were the O\xe2\x80\x99s simply that bad in Houston, or were the Astros pitchers simply that good? The answer is probably a mix of both. Having made the playoffs last year, and in spite of the poor start on this 2016 season, there is no doubt that the Astros are a pretty good baseball team. It will be interesting to see if they put together some fine games and streaks over the next couple of weeks.Now the question will be to see which offense shows up for game two of the series. And beyond that, it will also be interesting to see which Ubaldo takes to the mound \xe2\x80\x93 the good one or the bad one. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Ubaldo does Ubaldo things as Orioles blown out by Indians ...', ' In the classic film The Princess Bride, the hero Westley, in the guise of the Dread Pirate Roberts, tells his childhood love Buttercup, who does not yet recognize him, ""Life is pain. Anyone who says differently is selling something."" He must have just finished watching an Ubaldo Jimenez start.    So, too, did the unfortunate Orioles fans who tuned in to Saturday afternoon\'s lopsided 11-4 loss against the Indians. Jimenez was every bad stereotype about his pitching rolled into one. Can\'t throw strikes? You know it. Turning every baserunner into Usain Bolt? Yes, that too. It takes some hard work to manage to give up four stolen bases in the span of an inning and two-thirds, which was as far as Jimenez pitched into the game before Buck Showalter had seen enough and yanked him in favor of Vance Worley. Jimenez is surely up to that challenge. The ultimate Ubaldo start The hows and whys are almost not even worth discussing at this point. They are what they are because he is what he is. If for some reason a person was inclined to be generous towards Jimenez\'s pitching, they might note that three of the six runs Jimenez gave up were unearned - those being the result, directly and indirectly, of a Pedro Alvarez error at third base.    Alvarez in fact made two errors in the game. He should not be a third baseman. With a .194 batting average and a .644 OPS, it\'s not entirely clear what he should be, other than mostly on the bench.    In all, the Orioles committed four errors in the game, another sloppy effort. Only five of the Indians\' eleven runs were earned. Of course, five runs still would have beaten the Orioles today. There\'s no reason to be generous towards Jimenez because you have to be worse than just one Alvarez error to be yanked from a game before finishing the second inning. You have to be bad enough to walk three guys and give up five hits while recording only five outs.    It\'s now Memorial Day weekend and the highest-paid free agent pitcher the Orioles have ever signed is in the third year of his four year contract and he is sitting on a 6.36 ERA after this start. He is pitching as poorly as that ERA looks. Every start, it seems, the Orioles have to plan for what to do if Jimenez has another meltdown. Today, the plan was to have Worley go as far as possible, and he did yeoman\'s work in coming in to the blowout to eat up as many innings as possible. That ended up being 4.1 innings, so he got the O\'s at least through the sixth. What to do with Jimenez? Even the normally-sunny Jim Hunter was openly speculating on the MASN telecast about what the Orioles might have to do with Jimenez. You can kind of imagine that another bullpen demotion, along the lines of what the O\'s did with him in 2014, could be in his future.    Whether Worley or whoever else proves to be a good option as a starting pitcher for the O\'s, they all have one virtue: They are not Jimenez. Until Jimenez gets his act together, the Orioles are basically destroying their chances to win once every five games. That\'s a lot of games to just give up on. Sure enough, they were handed a gift opportunity today, with the Red Sox blowing a game late against the Blue Jays. Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel blew a save on his birthday, this after Boston took a ninth inning lead following different relievers blowing a Sox lead in the eighth. So the Red Sox lost and the Orioles had a chance to pull back into a tie for the AL East lead. Except they never really had a chance, not as long as Jimenez was the scheduled starter. That\'s just how it is right now. They will remain one game back. With such a deficit that they faced in the game, the Orioles scoring a few runs didn\'t matter too much for the sake of today\'s game. But perhaps it\'s a positive sign that eight of the nine starting position players had at least one hit - and even the hitless Joey Rickard walked twice. Another encouraging thing for the offense was that Mark Trumbo had a three hit game. Trumbo has been slumping lately, batting just .174 over the past seven days before today. If he\'s heating up, maybe that can carry over to tomorrow.    As bad as today\'s game was, it was only one loss. The Orioles will take the field tomorrow with a chance to win the series. Chris Tillman, the O\'s best starting pitcher by ERA, will be starting the game, while the Indians will send out Mike Clevinger, who has only ever made two MLB starts. The finale is scheduled to get under way at 1:10. Go do something fun with your night and don\'t think about this game any more.

While they didn\xe2\x80\x99t play a perfect game, they did enough to win. They also took their strikeout total which had been in the high teens for days, and lowered it to six last night. However while they were certainly more selective in when they would swing, they did exactly what I suggested yesterday: stayed aggressive.Mike Wright showed some promise, however he was unable to make it out of the fifth inning due to a Cleveland rally. Wright\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.2 IP, 6 H, 3 R, 2 BB, 4 K. I found it interesting that Wright was lifted when he was. While the Cleveland rally was obviously getting to him, it was also early. Perhaps this is rhetorical, however is Wright possibly a candidate to be sent down when Gallardo returns?The O\xe2\x80\x99s jumped on the Tribe early on;\xc2\xa0Manny Machado gave them a 1-0 lead with an RBI-single in the first inning. Later in the inning with two runners on,\xc2\xa0Jonathan Schoop\xe2\x80\x98s two-RBI double gave the Birds a 3-0 lead.

The Baltimore WireThe lead narrowed further in the fourth on a Napoli solo homer, however it was the fifth that did Wright in. He loaded the bases with nobody out, and then gave up the tying run on Lindor\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI. However after Wright left and the O\xe2\x80\x99s turned to Bundy, they managed to end the threat. While Cleveland had the momentum at that point, getting out of that fifth inning with the game only being tied was as big of a thing that happened in the entire game for the O\xe2\x80\x99s.However it was obvious that the Birds were tired of losing, and perhaps even embarrassed at having been handled so well by Houston. With a runner on in the seventh, Davis split the outfielders with a shot to the gap and gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s the lead back at 4-3. Later in the inning that lead expanded to 6-3 on\xc2\xa0Mark Trumbo\xe2\x80\x98s two-run homer. Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s Lindor would homer in the eighth to bring the Tribe to within 6-4, however it was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 night and on they went to victory.The win broke a four-game losing streak for the Birds, so it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a big one in that sense. However as I said yesterday, this team isn\xe2\x80\x99t about to start winning games by playing someone else\xe2\x80\x99s game. Small ball doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work with regard to the makeup of this team. It may work fine for teams such as Houston or Tampa, but not this band of sluggers.

The O\xe2\x80\x99s produced offensively as a team, and Jones himself had three hits.Dylan Bundy earned the win in relief of Mike Wright \xe2\x80\x93 his first major league victory. Keep in mind that Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s had injury issues, and when he has been on the roster he\xe2\x80\x99s usually been used in middle relief.

The restaurant is empty, which means that you can hear the chefs pounding the veal in the back. There will be many more customers later.The first time Palmer came here, in 1984, it was also empty. He peeked in and backed away, but the owner impressed him. When she was younger and part of an Orioles fan club, she explained, she had always wanted his autograph. Palmer dutifully tried the restaurant, loved it, and when he learned it was struggling, he gave it a plug to a local columnist. Now here it is, all these years later, thriving.So is Palmer, who strikes you, in his adopted hometown, as a bit like Rocky Balboa in \xe2\x80\x9cCreed,\xe2\x80\x9d the last movie in the \xe2\x80\x9cRocky\xe2\x80\x9d series.

He loved pitching when he did, largely for the challenge of working deep into games, the way Roberts had before him.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you did, because you could do it,\xe2\x80\x9d Palmer said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou really learn a lot about yourself. It takes guile, intelligence, conditioning, guts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  One pitcher, he said, stands out today \xe2\x80\x94 not only for his talent, but, it seems to Palmer, for his drive to go further than most: the Dodgers\xe2\x80\x99 Clayton Kershaw, who pitches at the same park where Palmer beat Koufax nearly 50 years ago. The game he analyzes has changed from the one he played, but Palmer is eager to see the modern master in July.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never met him, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to meet him this year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re playing out at Dodger Stadium.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mr. VersatilityOne of the more impressive parts of Kris Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s early career has been his willingness to play multiple positions. Last season, when he was the National League rookie of the year for the Chicago Cubs, Bryant played mostly at third base, appearing in the outfield only 19 times. Now, he rarely stays in one spot very long.Bryant has gone more than a month since he played more than three games in a row at one \xe2\x80\x94 and only one \xe2\x80\x94 position. From April 15 through 19, he played just third base. Since then, Bryant has bounced among third, left field, right field and even first base (for one out). He has played multiple positions in about a third of his games.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s so many guys in this clubhouse that might play a certain area, and I might need to make a sacrifice and move somewhere else for them if they\xe2\x80\x99re swinging the bat hot,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant said at Wrigley Field recently. \xe2\x80\x9cAt first, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard to prepare yourself each day, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a change of scenery. You\xe2\x80\x99re in left field, right field, third base \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s different. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m a little more used to it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s versatility has allowed Manager Joe Maddon to rotate Javier Baez and Tommy La Stella into the lineup at third base. Without a designated hitter spot in the N.L., Maddon said, outfield days give Bryant \xe2\x80\x9calmost like a day off\xe2\x80\x9d compared to the physical demands of third base. Staying sharp mentally in the outfield can be a challenge.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cPlaying the outfield is a little different in terms of my offensive side, because you have more time to think about it out there, which can be a good thing or a bad thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this year, so far, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made it a good thing, because last year, when I was playing the outfield, I was thinking a lot about my at-bats. This year, I\xe2\x80\x99m a little more focused on the whole defensive side of things.\xe2\x80\x9dBryant\xe2\x80\x99s statistics are essentially the same at third base or the outfield, and he has worked at the plate to improve one offensive trait in particular.

He struck out in 30.6 of his plate appearances last season and had cut that rate to 19.6, helping the Cubs to the majors\xe2\x80\x99 best record.Honoring GwynnA regrettable fashion trend in baseball, going back more than 20 years, is the way most players wear their pants: pulled down to their shoe tops, with no stirrups or socks showing.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been like that for a while,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jon Jay, an outfielder for the San Diego Padres. \xe2\x80\x9cBut guys wear different stuff underneath.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  For Jay \xe2\x80\x94 for every game \xe2\x80\x94 that means socks depicting Tony Gwynn, the Hall of Famer who spent 20 seasons with the Padres through 2001.

The Cleveland Indians have pushed their way to the top of the American League Central and will try to secure a third consecutive series win when they host the Baltimore Orioles in the rubber match of their three-game series on Sunday. The Indians have won nine of their last 13 contests to pull a season-high five games over .500. Cleveland dropped Friday\xe2\x80\x99s series opener 6-4 but got the offense moving again in an 11-4 victory on Saturday that featured three RBIs from Yan Gomes and two more from Mike Napoli. The Indians figured to lean on their pitching staff this season but are coming together offensively over the last two weeks, scoring six or more runs in seven of their last 13 contests. The Orioles sit one game behind Boston in the AL East but haven\xe2\x80\x99t helped themselves by dropping five of their last six. Baltimore has been in a bit of a funk offensively during the slide and have produced more than four runs only once in its last seven games \xe2\x80\x93 Friday\xe2\x80\x99s triumph. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Chris Tillman (6-1, 2.61 ERA) vs. Indians RH Mike Clevinger (0-1, 8.71) Tillman hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost since April 14 but did not figure in the decision at Houston on Tuesday despite allowing just two runs and three hits in seven innings. The solid outing marked the seventh straight quality start for the 28-year-old native of California. Tillman is 4-2 with a 3.89 ERA in seven career starts against Cleveland and earned a pair of wins over the club last season. Clevinger is making his third major-league start and is running out of time to prove himself with Carlos Carrasco (hamstring) making his way back from the disabled list. Clevinger was lit up for six runs on seven hits and three walks in five innings at the Chicago White Sox on Monday to absorb his first loss. The 25-year-old has surrendered three home runs in 10 1/3 total frames. WALK-OFFS 1. Napoli is 6-for-19 with two home runs, seven RBIs and six runs scored in his last five games after going hitless in the previous four contests. 2. Baltimore OF Mark Trumbo went 5-for-8 with a homer and two doubles in the first two games of the series. 3. Cleveland SS Francisco Lindor is 5-for-12 with four runs scored in his last three contests.

05/30/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: And Here Comes Boston', 'May 29, 2016; Cleveland, OH, USA; Baltimore Orioles left fielder Hyun Soo Kim (25) hits a home run during the seventh inning against the Cleveland Indians at Progressive Field. Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles finished an unusual road trip with a \xe2\x80\x9cgrind it out\xe2\x80\x9d win over the Indians 6-4 in true team fashion.The win gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 4-5 record on the strange trip to Anaheim, Houston and Cleveland. That is at least minimally acceptable, since such trips can (and have in the past) been disastrous. The Birds ran into some new bad boys particularly in Houston, but now the familiar old bad boys come to town in the week ahead.The Orioles only tallied a total of eight base hits on Sunday afternoon against the Indians, one each by every starter in the lineup other than leadoff hitter Adam Jones. And Jones got on base twice with walks. Yep, you read that correctly. How often has that ever happened? He is 4-for-11 with two walks in his three games as the number one hitter in the order, striking out only once. I have to confess that I would have never once considered this as workable.Chris Tillman has been the best starter for the Orioles, and he gave up only four hits in six innings, though three were home runs. Neither his best nor worst outing, he got the Birds through two-thirds of the game with no long-relief options available other than today\xe2\x80\x99s starter Tyler Wilson.The bullpen of \xe2\x80\x9cBOB\xe2\x80\x9d (Brach, O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Britton) had plenty of bend \xe2\x80\xa6 to the brink of breaking, but they held on to give three scoreless innings.The first three runs were driven home in classic Orioles fashion, Mark Trumbo drilling a bases-loaded triple off the left-field wall. But run number four came in a manufactured way uncommon to Baltimore. With Jonathan Schoop at second base, Nolan Reimold advanced him with a sacrifice fly, with Ryan Flaherty driving him home by the same.And the big blows were home runs by Hyun Soo Kim and Reimold. The former broke the 4-4 tie and was the eventual game winner. And any insurance run was big on this day. Just play these guys most days and be done with it!Now the focus turns to the AL East, with four games with Boston and three with the Yankees. With the way the Red Sox are playing, if the Orioles want to win this division, it may be up to themselves to make the difference by handling business themselves.The Orioles have had good success against the Red Sox in recent years. So far this year it is 2-1. In previous three seasons, each year the record was 11-8. In 2012, it was 13-5. Add all of that together and it is 48-30 (.615). The percentage will win every year, except 2016 in NL Central with the Cubs.

The Red Sox lead the universe in most batting statistics, having a team batting average of .296 and OBP of .359.\xc2\xa0 They are averaging 1.5 runs per game more than the Orioles.At the same time, Boston is 12th in the AL in team ERA, while also giving up the most walks.

He entered the game in a tough spot \xe2\x80\x93 runners at the corners with nobody out. The O\xe2\x80\x99s played the infield in to try to cut a run down at home plate, however O\xe2\x80\x99Day induced Napoli to ground out to third and the runner couldn\xe2\x80\x99t score. He then IBB\xe2\x80\x99d a hitter, and Cleveland brought up Chisenhall as a pinch-hitter\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and what an epic at-bat that was. The count ran full and Chisenhall fouled pitches off left and right \xe2\x80\x93 the at-bat was nine pitches to be exact. O\xe2\x80\x99Day threw everything he had at Chisenhall, however he always was able to nic or tap the ball. That is until he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, and O\xe2\x80\x99Day froze him with a breaking ball for strike three. He then proceeded to strike out Gomes to end the threat and the inning.You aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to see a more clutch performance in such a big spot by a reliever than what you saw right there. And manager\xc2\xa0Buck Showalter said as much after the game (quote courtesy of Jordan Bastian, MLB.com):Chisenhall\xe2\x80\x99s had some luck against him. I like Darren against anyone, but it was cat and mouse. That was a gutsy pitch to throw the back door breaking ball. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to get hitters out, especially as good of an offense as they are. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we are not playing them again for a while.So while the story of the day in some senses was Kim\xe2\x80\x99s homer, in my view it\xe2\x80\x99s Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day who rules the roost for this game. Kim\xe2\x80\x99s homer was big for sure, but what O\xe2\x80\x99Day did was huge. I suspect that if that\xe2\x80\x99s any other reliever in baseball right now, he either walks in a run or gives up a base hit which ultiately surrenders the lead.The Orioles now return home to open up a homestand with a Memorial Day matinee against Boston.

05/31/2016,"[('The Orioles bench players have been terrible. Can it get ...', ' There is a reason why these guys are not in the starting lineup most days. Whether it\'s because of their struggles with the bat, or that they have issues in the field, something keeps them from being regular players, but the Orioles bench has been especially terrible in 2016.    This is based on the situation right now! Hyun-soo Kim looks to be the regular left fielder for the time being. Nolan Reimold should be the first choice in right field with Mark Trumbo DHing. And Ryan Flaherty starts at third base while J.J. Hardy recovers from injury. Here is the current bench: Caleb Joseph: .175/.235/.206, 0 HR, 0 RBI, 5 BB, 14 SO, -0.4 WAR Joseph has been really bad. The season is more than a quarter over and he still doesn\'t have a single RBI. That doesn\'t seem possible given the fact that he and Matt Wieters basically shared catching duties 50/50 up until just recently. Another issue for him has been the big time struggles of Ubaldo Jimenez. Joseph has served as Jimenez\'s ""personal catcher"" of sorts, but the right-handed starter has been one of the worst pitchers in baseball (2-6, 6.36 ERA, 66 ERA+, 1.873 FIP). Does he really merit having his own catcher?    Joey Rickard: .247/.307/.356, 4 HR, 11 RBI, 15 BB, 39 SO, -0.6 WAR Rickard-mania has subsided in a big way. With the bat, the O\'s Rule 5 pick has been OK. He has provided a bit more power than most would expect from that wiry frame, but he doesn\'t get on base enough to continue on as the regular lead-off man. With the current preference of manager Buck Showalter looking to be Hyun-soo Kim in left field, Joey Baseball may move down the order.    His biggest problem is something that was talked up as a strong point in Spring Training: defense. Between all three outfield positions, Rickard has a combined UZR of -8.9. That is pretty remarkably terrible. His arm has a -2.6 rating while his range gets a -6.9. Ugh. Paul Janish: .071/.188/.071, 0 HR, 0 RBI, 2 BB, 2 SO, -0.2 WAR What can you really say? The moment J.J. Hardy returns from his foot injury, Janish will be out the door. The 33-year-old\'s defense is serviceable but he is basically an automatic out at the plate    Pedro Alvarez: .194/.294/.350, 3 HR, 11 RBI, 15 BB, 27 SO, -0.6 WAR The former Pirate may be the biggest disappointment of the season. He came to Baltimore with the expectation of adding a plentiful number of DONGS to the O\'s already impressively powerful lineup. But he has not done that so far. The batting average was always going to be low, but under .200? His walk-to-strikeout ratio has been a pleasant surprise, but has not made up for the low slugging percentage. And Alvarez is not a good fielder so if he isn\'t hitting, there is no reason for him to play Any relief from the minors? If we go based on the Norfolk Tides record (17-34) then it seems pretty clear that the team is struggling as a whole. There aren\'t too many guys pushing for spots at the big league level.    One exception may be catcher Audry Perez. The backstop is hitting .327 over 30 games. He is 27 years old and played three games with the St. Louis Cardinals a couple seasons back. The scouting report on him is that he is a decent hitter and an average fielder. Is he good enough to replace Joseph? That is a tough one. Showalter seems to have an affinity for Joseph and the catcher has become a fan favorite.  Xavier Avery looked to be on the original Opening Day roster. He was the last player re-assigned to the minor leagues prior to the beginning of the season. If Kim had accepted the demotion, Avery could be seeing some time in Baltimore. The former top prospect offers speed (9-for-10 stolen bases), an ability to get on base a little bit (.333 career minors OBP), and MLB experience. But the corner outfield positions are in a logjam right now.  Adding to that in the future could be Mike Yastrzemski, who is loving life early on in Virginia. Through 13 games, he is hitting .333 with two home runs and seven RBI as a Tide. He profiles as a fourth outfielder-type anyway, so he could work as a bench player. But a September call-up seems more likely than a mid-summer promotion. Since Rickard cannot be sent down this season and, for the moment, Kim is hitting (and has refused a demotion in the past) it seems as though Yaz will need to wait until the end of season to make his MLB debut. Then there is the gaggle of veteran names you have heard a million times already: Henry Urrutia, Dariel Alvarez, L.J. Hoes and Michael Almanzar. Alvarez has been the best of the bunch as he is slashing .274/.301/.360 with just one home run. Those numbers don\'t exactly bust down the major league door. But the other three have been downright bad. Urrutia was demoted to double-A Bowie recently. Hoes is hitting .213 and Almanzar is not much better at .217. And, of course, the ""prospects"". These are guys like Trey Mancini, Chance Sisco and Christian Walker. Sisco is doing well enough with the Baysox, slashing .306/.404/.373. He is still just 21 years old. Mancini was killing it with Bowie (.302/.413/.698, seven home runs) but has had some slight growing pains in Norfolk (.252/.331/.433, four home runs). And Walker has continued his nosedive in performance that has followed him each of the past three seasons. In 2016, his batting average is down to .235 and he has an OBP of just .295. Of those three, Mancini is the closest to being ready, but he doesn\'t fit on the roster apart from a DH.     Going forward No major league bench is going to be perfect. But the current iteration of the Orioles reserves is a confusing one to have. Typically, you want those guys to have some specific tool that makes them useful. Rickard can hit lefties pretty well (.286 BA), but not necessarily better than Reimold or Kim. Alvarez has power, but hasn\'t showed it. Janish is a fine fielder, but not more reliable than Ryan Flaherty or Manny Machado. We know Joseph can do a job behind the plate, but his bat is so bad right now that it makes him tough to play. Who knows what the answer is to the Baltimore bench quandry? Certainly not me. But it is a problem. Good teams don\'t have their reserves filled with players that are a drain on the rest of the roster. Teams must have substitutes to fill in for the starters in situations where they struggle. Showalter can\'t rely on the same nine or 10 guys for 162 games. If somehow they manage to get to the playoffs, they may not go far. The Maryland summers are hot and muggy and awful, really. Tired legs will lead to poor play.

The Boston Red Sox came into Baltimore with a chance to put some distance between themselves and the rest of the American League East and took a step toward accomplishing that goal in the series opener. The Red Sox will try to make it two in a row over the Orioles and push the gap to three games in the division when they visit Baltimore for the second of a four-game set on Tuesday. Boston beat the Orioles at their own game in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s opener, slugging three home runs in the sixth inning or later to turn a tight game into a 7-2 rout. The Red Sox had some trouble getting outs late in games while dropping two of three in Toronto over the weekend but managed to get the bullpen an extra day of rest as Steven Wright tossed his third complete game on Monday. Baltimore is one of the best slugging teams in the majors with 69 home runs but is having trouble pushing runs across over the last week-plus. The Orioles are 2-6 in their last eight games and are averaging 2.5 runs in those six setbacks. PITCHING MATCHUP: Red Sox LH Eduardo Rodriguez (2015: 10-6, 3.85 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (0-2, 3.24) Rodriguez was a shoo-in for a rotation spot before going down with a knee injury in spring training, and his return prompted the team to push Clay Buchholz to the bullpen. The 23-year-old Venezuelan surrendered three or fewer earned runs in 17 of his 21 starts during his 2015 rookie campaign. Rodriguez, who was acquired from Baltimore in a trade for Andrew Miller in 2014, struggled against his original organization with an 0-2 mark and a 4.20 ERA in three starts. Gausman has yet to earn a win in seven starts this season and struggled through five innings at Houston on Thursday. The LSU product was ripped for three home runs \xe2\x80\x93 matching his total from the first six starts \xe2\x80\x93 and charged with four runs on five hits and one walk. Gausman has made 10 career appearances \xe2\x80\x93 five starts \xe2\x80\x93 against the Red Sox and owns a 2-1 record with a 3.12 ERA and 36 strikeouts in 34 2/3 total innings. WALK-OFFS 1. Red Sox SS Xander Bogaerts went 2-for-4 on Monday to push his hitting streak to 23 games and lift his batting average to .354. 2. Baltimore RHP Yovani Gallardo (shoulder) came through a simulated game on Saturday with no issues and will begin a minor league rehab assignment on Thursday. 3. Boston DH David Ortiz has homered in each of his last three starts, pushing his season total to 14 and his league-leading RBI total to 47.

06/02/2016,"[('Orioles hit tons of homers, crush dreams of Porcello, Red ...', ' If the word ""dong"" used in the context of a home run in baseball bothers you, do not read the remainder of this article.    The thing about the Orioles is that you can stop them from hitting dongs for a little while, but not forever. There will be dongs and their arrival will be terrible, swift, and fierce. Any homer-less stretch is only lulling some poor fools into a false sense of security before an ambush of dongs. So it was on Thursday night against the Red Sox. Somehow, the Orioles had won on Wednesday without dongs. A fluke or an accident. They cannot be contained for long, and they were not. The Orioles crushed seven home runs in the game, and as it turned out, they needed most of them in a 12-7 victory. After all of the agony of the first two games of the series, the Orioles managed to split  with the AL East-leading Red Sox and they end it exactly where they began: One game back of the lead.    A tale of two Ubaldos You will be forgiven if your hopes for the Orioles winning this game were low, given that Ubaldo Jimenez was the starting pitcher. Yet Ubaldo can surprise you, at least for a little while, and so he did tonight - for a little while.    Jimenez was nearly perfect through three innings and he carried a no-hitter through four innings. Not all that impressive, of course, but positively un-Ubaldian. So were five shutout innings, which he did in fact throw. The problem for Ubaldo is that he also pitched the sixth inning. There was nothing problematic about this. He did not enter the inning with a high pitch count. He was cruising. There was no reason to have anyone warming, until suddenly there was.    Jimenez faced six batters in the sixth inning. He retired none of these batters. There were five hits, including a two-run single by Xander Bogaerts that extended his hitting streak to 26 games, and a three run home run hit by David Ortiz that put the Red Sox up at the time by a 5-4 margin. This swiftly erased any good feelings that may have been accumulated about the O\'s early in the game. Ortiz is looking a lot like Barry Bonds at age 40. The guy is batting .335/.415/.730 on the season. Wow. The sixth and final hit was enough to chase Jimenez from the game at last. Jimenez failed the Matusz test today. He started with a 6.36 ERA and ended with a 6.59 ERA. He\'s into the territory where this starts to be extra horrible to witness as it unfolds.    They shall dong in the Yards and on Eutaw Street Although an early Orioles lead was erased by Jimenez in the sixth, that does not make the dongs any less glorious. They hit two of them early, one in the fourth and one in the fifth, off of Red Sox starter Rick Porcello. Mark Trumbo launched a majestic shot into the left field stands with Chris Davis on base - his 16th home run of the year. Adam Jones followed an inning later by ripping a home run into those same seats with Ryan Flaherty on base. That was Jones\' sixth homer this season. Things were briefly depressing in the sixth inning thanks to Jimenez, but Mychal Givens came on and stopped the bleeding, and, having done so, he opened the door to more dongs. Trumbo ambushed Porcello a second time with one out in the sixth inning, tying the game at 5-5 and bringing joy back to Birdland. Make that #17 on the year for Trumbo, his fourth Double Trumboner of the season. If you think that the Orioles were done hitting home runs, you haven\'t been paying attention this year. In the seventh inning, the Sox sent out reliever Robbie Ross, a lefty, to face a stretch of Orioles hitters that included two lefties. Flaherty walked, then Francisco Pe\xc3\xb1a, making his Orioles debut, added a single.    Ross got out the next two batters, bringing up Manny Machado. Sox manager John Farrell chose to summon righty Junichi Tazawa to face Machado, a righty. This is good strategy in general but poor in Machado\'s case: Machado hits righties better. What might Machado have done against Ross? The world will never know. What we do know is what he did against Tazawa. Immediately after a mound visit from his catcher, Christian Vazquez, Tazawa gave up yet another Orioles home run - a three-run shot that gave the Orioles an 8-5 lead. That was the 14th homer this year for Machado. That was all the runs the Orioles would need, though it did still get interesting later, despite more dongs being piled on. As Tazawa continued into the next inning, he gave up a second home run, this time to Pedro Alvarez, who now has four on the season. Tazawa proceeded to walk Jonathan Schoop - a tough feat - and then allow Schoop to steal a base, an even tougher feat. Time to try someone new! It was Noe Ramirez\'s turn to be the sacrifice. Pe\xc3\xb1a welcomed Ramirez to the game with, you guessed it, a dinger! Pe\xc3\xb1a clubbed a home run into the Orioles bullpen, where T.J. McFarland bungled the opportunity to catch it. These are the first two runs Pe\xc3\xb1a has ever driven in at the big league level - he\'d only notched seven at-bats before tonight. Thankfully, the dropped catch in the bullpen did not prove to be a bad omen. The next batter, Jones, joined Trumbo in the multi-homer club. When this fury finally subsided, the Orioles were leading 12-5.    Meet the new Matusz Called up today from the minors was veteran lefty reliever Brian Duensing. The Orioles needed some bullpen help, and what the heck, a seven run lead is a pretty safe time to toss a guy in there, isn\'t it? The O\'s having such a huge lead was pretty crucial, actually, as the O\'s announcers on MASN alluded darkly to a number of O\'s relievers being unavailable in the game due to recent heavy use. Givens, who came in when the game was tied, pitched two innings and ended up getting the win. He\'s now 4-0. Brad Brach added an inning as well, when the game was still close. In the ninth, it was not close. Duensing was the man to get things finished. Three straight seeing-eye grounders greeted him into the game, including one in which the Orioles hilariously got an out at second base because the ball got to Joey Rickard so fast that he threw out Chris Young, who may not have actually been paying attention. Early series star Mookie Betts drove in a run with a single, really the only well-hit ball off of Duensing in the inning. An easy popout by Dustin Pedroia was the second out, then Duensing got Bogaerts to hit a line drive right at Nolan Reimold, the defensive sub in left. Reimold somehow muffed this ball, which was somehow scored as a base hit and not an error, scoring another run. There was, thus, some brief drama as Ortiz lumbered to the plate, spat in his hands, and did whatever it is that he does to preen for an at-bat. Ortiz flew out to Reimold, who caught the ball this time, as you are supposed to. Game over, man. Game over.    The Yankees await the Orioles next, while the Red Sox return to Boston to face the surging Blue Jays. With a good weekend, the Orioles could end up back atop the division. In the 7:05 series opener tomorrow, Chris Tillman and Nathan Eovaldi are the scheduled starters. Join us for what will hopefully be a fun night!

Baltimore Orioles defeated Boston Red Sox 13-9. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles prevailed 13-9 over the Red Sox on Wednesday night in one of the more unusual games one will ever see.The final score, along with all of the home runs, hits, and walks, had the look of a beer league softball game rather than a professional baseball game. Also, a ground ball with the bases through the legs of a certain diminutive second baseman added to the same appearance. That was special!Boston hit a total of five home runs. How often does a team give up five homers and still win the game? When is the last time the O\xe2\x80\x99s have done this? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, though the answer may appear somewhere in other media coverage of the game. But it is exceedingly rare to have this happen.Along with five home runs, Orioles pitchers allowed a total of 15 hits and five walks. And even though the only extra base hits by the O\xe2\x80\x99s were four doubles, they did pound out 14 hits of their own along with nine bases on balls (including four to Chris Davis). If you calculate the total on-base percentage of both teams, it was .478.\xe2\x80\x9cOur guys just refused to be outscored tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buck Showalter in the postgame press conference.This sort of game is what the Baltimore fanbase feared was going to be the type that would be repeated over and over this season. The pitching would be poor and the Orioles power hitters and total offensive muscle would have to simply outscore the opposition. This is only the fifth time in 51 games that the Orioles have won by needing to score more than five runs. A total of 11 losses have been in games where the opposition has scored five or more runs.At this point of the season, just shy of one-third of the way through it, the Orioles have been held to two or less runs on 16 occasions. By comparison, this happened 18 times in 2015 in the same number of games and 51 times over the course of the whole season. So the current Birds are on about the same pace, though we thought this team would be a better-scoring outfit. It may yet happen.Getting three hits apiece for the Orioles were Pedro Alvarez and Hyun Soo Kim. For Alvarez, this was the second occasion of doing this, the other being against the White Sox on April 30th. For Kim, this was his third three-hit game amongst his 14 starts this season.

That\xe2\x80\x99s why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t argue a lot. If you look at things realistically, there are two pitches there basically the same, but one guy hadn\xe2\x80\x99t hit 150 home runs against us in two days.As I said, it appeared that both teams seemed of the impression that there was no intent on Wright\xe2\x80\x99s part. His control was a bit off as it was last night, and that one obviously slipped. However umpires are now taught to do anything they can to avoid a brawl.

Mark Trumbo blasted a pair of homers Thursday to earn a share of the major-league lead with 17 while Adam Jones added a pair of shots and is 6-for-15 over his last three games. New York\xe2\x80\x99s Nathan Eovaldi looks to win his sixth straight start as he opposes Chris Tillman, who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost since April 14. PITCHING MATCHUP: Yankees RH Nathan Eovaldi (6-2, 3.71 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Chris Tillman (7-1, 2.92) Eovaldi ran his winning streak to five in somewhat miraculous fashion last time out, allowing one run over six innings and earning the victory despite the Yankees managing only one hit. The 26-year-old has permitted a total of seven runs during his winning streak, although he has failed to go beyond six frames in each of his last four turns. Eovaldi has made three career starts against the Orioles, logging a 1-0 record and 3.86 ERA. Tillman stretched his unbeaten streak to eight starts after allowing four runs and four hits \xe2\x80\x93 three homers \xe2\x80\x93 over six innings at Cleveland on Sunday. It marked the first time Tillman yielded more than three earned runs since his lone defeat in mid-April and the fifth time in six turns that he has walked at last three batters. He pitched seven innings of one-run ball versus the Yankees on May 3 to improve to 7-6 with a 4.68 ERA against them. \x7fWALK-OFFS 1. Orioles SS Manny Machado has recorded five RBIs in the last two games and has hit safely in nine of his last 10 contests. 2. Yankees CF Jacoby Ellsbury drove in three runs Thursday to end his eight-game RBI drought. 3. Baltimore sent RHP Mike Wright to Triple-A Norfolk and promoted LHP Brian Duensing.

Absent a contract extension, his free agency is still more than two years away. On the other hand, unless he gets a new deal from the Orioles, his free agency is only a little more than two years away. Within the last week, Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports suggested that the price tag for Manny Machado could get into the $400 million range. That\'s a lot of money, and one it\'s rather hard to imagine the Orioles committing to even a player as good as Machado. Added to this anxiety is the frustration of what might have been. MLB Network\'s Jon Heyman, writing yesterday for Today\'s Knuckleball, contributed this tantalizing tidbit: Some time within Machado\'s first two seasons, had ""a seven year deal with Machado that seemed all but done"" but they were not able to finalize the contract extension.    Although Heyman does not know what exactly caused the deal not to happen, or even what might have been the precise terms of the contract, he reiterates that it is said to have been ""on the cusp of reality.""    It\'s unfortunate that they weren\'t able to work out whatever they were talking about at that time. Still, realistically, a deal in Machado\'s rookie year of 2012, when he still had six full years of team control awaiting, would only have added one year to what the O\'s already have of Machado. If that talk came in 2013, his first full year, it would have added two years. O\'s fans would surely take the extra two years over zero additional years, though that would still leave the O\'s eventually facing a Machado mega-contract that would probably exceed their price range. If you\'d like Machado to be the next great career-long Oriole, there\'s going to be disappointment eventually.    Looking for a reason to hope The best that can be hoped for is that the idea that Machado\'s departure could be inevitable is less certain than Heyman makes it seem to be. This could be a fool\'s hope for all of us, or perhaps the desperate man hanging on a cliffside, grasping for the only weak root he can reach, knowing it will break and he will fall to a gruesome death on the rocks. Heyman is way more plugged in to the baseball rumor mill than I am. But it\'s worth noting that there are a couple of things about his column that might cause some question about some of his assertions about the Orioles. Here\'s a sentence from the column about Joey Rickard:    Joey Rickard looks like a steal. \xe2\x80\x9cEasily the best Rule 5 pickup of the year,\xe2\x80\x9d one scout noted. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how Tampa just let him go.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rickard is actually among the least valuable players in baseball, according to WAR. He is at -0.6 in bWAR and -0.9 in fWAR. That\'s what a .664 OPS corner outfielder who doesn\'t steal many bases who is getting dinged in defensive metrics for both range and arm strength is going to be worth. So if the person who is popping off to Heyman about Machado knows about as much about what\'s going on as whatever scout proclaimed that Rickard ""looks like a steal,"" well. That\'s a judgement you can question. Also, Heyman\'s article has way more to say about Bryce Harper and outlandish hypothetical contract demands in the $500-$750 million range (yes, really) than it does about Machado, who is mentioned almost as an afterthought. There is not any concrete information, or anything more than just a vague rumor, that\'s connected to Machado. There\'s no getting around the fact that as things stand right now, it\'ll surely cost a lot of money to secure Machado\'s services long term. That\'s undeniable reality whatever Heyman or any other baseball writer happens to write about it. Machado is young and very good - a 23-year-old MVP candidate in his fifth big league season.    If we\'re lucky, it\'s not as bad as all that as far as the O\'s chances of retaining Machado. They opened up the checkbook to keep Chris Davis, after all, and they do not have many payroll commitments going on in the years when Machado would be making mega-bucks. At least Machado\'s free agency is still more than two years away. Wait. Machado\'s free agency is only a bit more than two years away. Ahhhh!  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles vs. Yankees series preview: June 3-5 - Camden Chat', ' The Bronx Bombers will come to Camden Yards for the second time this season in the upcoming weekend. During the first face-off, the Orioles took two out of three from the Yankees. Neither team is playing all that well this time around, so we may be in store for some ugly baseball.    New York\'s struggles have come mostly on the road, where they have a record of 11-16. Meanwhile, the Birds are pretty good at home, boasting an 18-10 record from the cozy confines.  When it comes to pitching, the two squads are in a similar position. Overall, the O\'s staff has a 4.01 ERA; the Yanks are a touch worse at 4.15. The rotation is where both clubs struggle. The visitors starters have a 4.40 ERA and the hosts have more issues with a 4.78 ERA. In the bullpen, the Birds have a distinct advantage. Their relievers rep a group ERA of 2.75 (3rd-best in MLB) where as the pinstripers are nearly a whole run higher (3.72 ERA). Offensively, the Yankees are struggling big time. Their 193 runs scored are the worst in the American League. They are also the worst in the AL in batting average (.231), on-base percentage (.299) and slugging percentage (.371). Something good: they have struck out the fourth fewest times in baseball. So, there\'s that.    Game 1: Friday, June 3, 7:05 p.m., MASN RHP Nathan Eovaldi (6-2, 3.71 ERA) vs. RHP Chris Tillman (7-1, 2.92 ERA) The Orioles have been a OK team for Eovaldi to face over the last few years. He has made three starts against Baltimore and sits with a record of 1-0 and a 3.86 ERA over 16.1 innings. He is yet to get through six innings against them but has also never allowed more than three runs.             Daily Baseball Data   Tillman has had a tough time facing the Yanks. Over 17 starts he is 7-6 with a 4.68 ERA and a batting average against of .296. That is the highest BAA of any team that Tillman has faced more than twice in his career. However, he pitched against them in May and was fantastic, tossing seven innings and allowing just one run while striking out nine and walking four.         Daily Baseball Data   Game 2: Saturday, June 4, 7:15 p.m., FOX RHP Ivan Nova (3-3, 3.98 ERA) vs. RHP Tyler Wilson (2-4, 3.83 ERA) Nova has two mediocre starts back-to-back, allowing eight runs over his last 12.2 innings on the mound; both games were against Toronto. It does not look like it will get easier as he is set to face the Orioles, who he has a 5.07 ERA against lifetime. Over 15 games, including 14 starts, he is 6-4. Baltimore hitters are slashing .273/.326/.471 against him with 14 home runs over 94.0 innings.            Daily Baseball Data   Each start he has, the more I believe in Wilson. The 26-year-old has lost three consecutive games, allowing 11 runs over his past 18.2 innings, but he always seems to keep the team within striking distance. In May he took on the Yankees and put in a ""quality start"" as he allowed two earn runs over six innings. Not bad.         Daily Baseball Data   Game 3: Sunday, June 5, 1:35 p.m., MASN LHP CC Sabathia (2-4, 2.85 ERA) vs. RHP Kevin Gausman (0-3, 3.78 ERA) Who is this left-hander and what has he done with the 2015-version of Sabathia? The chunky southpaw has been genuinely good this year as he has a 146 ERA+ and 3.18 FIP. Not exactly $23 million per year good, but still good. Sabathia was dominant back in May against the Birds as he threw seven scoreless frames for the win. In his career he is 19-7 with a 3.35 ERA over 34 starts.         Daily Baseball Data   The finest start of Gausman\'s season came against the Bombers last month as he went eight innings, struck out four and allowed only three hits while not giving up any walks or runs. But recently his form has dipped. Over the past two starts against the Red Sox and Astros he has given up nine runs over 11 innings. He has been especially prone to the long ball, allowing six in those games as well. The light-hitting New York lineup could be the perfect cure...we hope.

They had Mark Teixeira, who had a resurgent season last year until it was ended in mid-August by a freak accident, a foul ball off his shin. They also had a worthy young successor in Greg Bird, who coolly slugged 11 home runs in the final seven weeks.Now, the position is threatening to become a sinkhole, one that appears ready to stand as a proxy for the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 season.After losing Bird to season-ending shoulder surgery before the start of spring training, Teixeira plunged into a prolonged slump and on Friday night he left a 6-5 loss to the Baltimore Orioles with an injured right knee.Teixeira exited in the third inning with what was described by the team as \xe2\x80\x9cdiscomfort,\xe2\x80\x9d was examined by an Orioles doctor and sent for a magnetic resonance imaging test.

The Baltimore Orioles look to extend their winning streak to four games when they continue a three-game series with the visiting New York Yankees on Saturday. The Orioles rallied from an early three-run deficit to top the Yankees by a 6-5 margin in the series opener, pulling into a tie with Boston atop the American League East. Mark Trumbo had three hits and Chris Davis slugged his 11th homer to lead the way for Baltimore. The Yankees have lost four of five, are 3-5 on their current 10-game road trip and will turn to right-hander Ivan Nova, who has two of his three career complete games against the Orioles. That might give outfielder Hyun Soo Kim another start for Baltimore after the rookie had three hits Saturday to raise his average to .321 in 21 games this season, virtually all against right-handers. The Orioles counter with Tyler Wilson, who has lost three straight starts. PITCHING MATCHUP: Yankees RH Ivan Nova (3-3, 3.98 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Tyler Wilson (2-4, 3.83) After allowing one run in each of his first three starts, Nova has given up eight runs in 12 2/3 innings over his last two outings. The Dominican is 6-4 but has a 5.07 ERA in 15 career games (four starts) against the Orioles. Davis is 9-for-29 with three homers and 10 RBIs versus Nova.

After taking two of three from their American League East rivals at home in early May, the Baltimore Orioles look to repeat the feat when they host the New York Yankees on Sunday for the rubber match of their three-game set. Baltimore, which allowed a total of one run in its victories against New York in early May, rallied from a three-run deficit to edge the Yankees 6-5 in the series opener before its rally fell short despite a six-run seventh inning on Saturday in an 8-6 defeat. Starlin Castro appears to be heating up for the Yankees, recording a three-hit performance to improve to 5-for-13 over his last three games after registering only two hits in his previous eight contests. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s three-game winning streak ended with Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s setback, but the team has been on an offensive tear this month while scoring 37 runs over four games. Mark Trumbo entered Saturday with a share of the major-league lead in homers and belted his 18th of the season, giving him three blasts in his last three contests. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 slugger has been held without a hit only twice in his last 11 games, going 15-for-43 with four multi-hit performances in that span. PITCHING MATCHUP: Yankees LH CC Sabathia (3-4, 2.85 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (0-3, 3.78) Sabathia has been solid all season after a disappointing 2015, allowing fewer than four runs in each of his eight starts and a total of five over 26 innings in his last four outings. The 35-year-old Californian has not received any support of late, however, as he gave up two runs in back-to-back hard-luck losses to Toronto while the Yankees scored once in each contest. Sabathia has feasted on the Orioles over his career, going 19-7 overall with a pair of shutouts and a 3.35 ERA in 34 starts \xe2\x80\x93 including an 11-6 record and 3.63 ERA in 21 outings at Camden Yards. Gausman remains in search of his first win of the season as he makes his ninth start \xe2\x80\x93 and second against New York. The 25-year-old native of Colorado has lost two straight outings, surrendering four or more runs in each while serving up three homers in both contests. Gausman is 3-2 with one complete game and a 2.31 ERA in 12 career appearances \xe2\x80\x93 six starts \xe2\x80\x93 versus New York but settled for a no-decision in their meeting on May 5 despite scattering three hits over eight scoreless innings. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles CF Adam Jones became the club\xe2\x80\x99s all-time leader in RBIs at Camden Yards on Saturday, belting a three-run homer to give him 370 and move past Cal Ripken Jr. (368) for the honor. 2. New York placed 1B Mark Teixeira on the 15-day disabled list with torn cartilage in his right knee and recalled INF Chris Parmelee from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. 3. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s starting pitchers have surrendered at least five runs in each of the team\xe2\x80\x99s last five games.

You can throw the greatest fastball of all time, but if hitters know it\xe2\x80\x99s coming eventually they\xe2\x80\x99ll adjust and start to put it in play.And that\xe2\x80\x99s part of what happened in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game against New York, as Wilson threw far too many first pitch fastballs, and New York hitters were waiting for them.

Tack on Refsnyder\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double and Romine\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single, and the Birds were suddenly down 5-0.Of course the pressure was kept on an inning later when Castro ran the score to 6-0 with an RBI-single. In the sixth New York pulled off a play that generall only works in little league, but since everything was working for them to that point they probably figured why not. They pulled off a double-steal, with Ellsbury successfully stealing home plate, and running the score to 7-0.However the good news for the Birds is that they battled back. In fact, they almost took control of the game. Granted it was too little too late, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t totally keep these O\xe2\x80\x99s down. They are in fact a better team than the current New York Yankees, and regardless of for whom anyone follows that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.Mark Trumbo got the O\xe2\x80\x99s on the board in the last of the seventh with a solo home run, which was followed by Wieters of all people legging out an infield single. (As a guy who similar to Wieters runs like the \xe2\x80\x9cQueen Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine myself doing that \xe2\x80\x93 but he did!) That brought\xc2\xa0Pedro Alvarez to the plate and he smacked a two-run homer, cutting the lead to 7-3.The O\xe2\x80\x99s caught NY\xe2\x80\x99s Nova just as he was starting to tire, as he had been great to that point. But New York couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a reliever ready in time, and still with nobody out in the inning Adam Jones came to the plate with two on. And Jones did what Jones does, hitting a three-run home run that put the O\xe2\x80\x99s right back in the swing of things at 7-6. However New York\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen is solid as we know, and they shut the Birds down for the remainder of the game. ARod would add an RBI-single in the ninth, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s fell 8-6.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerJones\xe2\x80\x99 three-run homer also put him in an elite category. It was his 370th RBI, which passes the great\xc2\xa0Cal Ripken Jr. for the most RBI in the history of Camden Yards (Ripken\xe2\x80\x99s mark was 368). Mind you that Ripken also played the first half of his career at Memorial Stadium, but until last night he held that mark. While Jones might have slightly more power, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always felt that the two were very similar hitters in terms of where they put the ball and so forth.When told of the new record after the game, Jones was predictably humble about it, and he gave credit to those around him (quote courtesy of Steve Melewski, MASNsports):I think that is pretty cool. Means I\xe2\x80\x99ve been around here a little bit and have been fortunate to be healthy and play with some really good players over the years. It is a team thing. It is not like I hit home runs to always drive myself in.However at the end of the day, it\xe2\x80\x99s a loss for the Birds. Boston reclaimed first place by virtue of their win yesterday afternoon, however again it\xe2\x80\x99s a long season. The key for the O\xe2\x80\x99s is to take the series, against a NY team which as I said above is inferior to them for all intents and purposes.

The Orioles won 3-1. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles took two out of three games from the New York Yankees over the weekend, laying two losses upon the NY bullpen.Every win counts the same at the end of 162 games, but we all know that some are better than others. And Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s comeback 3-1 win over the Yankees fits in the \xe2\x80\x9cexcellent\xe2\x80\x9d category. It could have gone the other way. A good, quality start might have been wasted.There were more than a few opportunities for a clutch hit. Two of the best were bases loaded situations for Mark Trumbo, but six pitches total gave Sabathia a pair of clutch strikeouts. Trumbo can look totally lost for two or three games, but then hit five homers in the next three.In the bottom of the eighth inning after a rain delay, with runners on first and second, the Orioles were a combined 0-for-9 at that point. New catcher Francisco Pena (who is now 4-for-7 and loving the major leagues) broke the streak with a single to right field, though not scoring the runner and leaving the Yankees with a 1-0 advantage. The Pena hit was off fireballing Arnoldis Chapman, going triple digits as always.Finally, pinch-hitting Matt Wieters broke through with a two-out, two-strike, two-RBI grounder up the middle as the key hit of the game. On comes our lefty, Zach Britton, who nailed his 17th consecutive save of the season. Baltimore Orioles: first place.Wieters is now hitting .324 with runners in scoring position. The bat has very much come alive for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 catcher. Hitting only .214 in April, he improved to .333 for the month of May. Currently he sits at .287 for the season. Having started 35 of the 55 games so far, we can probably expect that pace to pick up.Both the Yankees and Orioles have strong bullpens. But it was the Baltimore relief corps that came limping into the series just a bit with Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day going to the disabled list.But for the series, the O\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen gave up three runs in 11.1 innings, whereas the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 relievers yielded four runs in 8.2 frames. Beyond that, the Orioles touched up Dellin Betances for the two losses, raising his ERA from 2.81 to 3.54. And Chapman suffered his first blown save.

After a delay of 1 hour, 37 minutes, Chapman entered seeking to earn his 10th save in 10 tries.The hard-throwing closer struck out Jonathan Schoop before Fernando Pena singled to load the bases. Pinch-hitter Matt Wieters then fell behind 0-2 before bouncing a 101 mph fastball up the middle, and a third run scored on the play when center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury threw wild to the plate.Baltimore\'s comeback ruined a decent outing by New York starter CC Sabathia, who allowed two hits and a career-high tying six walks over 5 1/3 shutout innings. Kirby Yates and Betances followed before Chapman entered.New York fell to 25-1 when leading after seven innings.""They\'re not going to be perfect. They\'re going to be really, really good,"" Girardi said of the bullpen trio of Betances, Andrew Miller and Chapman.Chapman had been flawless in save situations until this one.""It\'s tough for Chappie to have to come back out after an hour-and-a-half delay,"" Girardi said. ""He got the count where he wanted. Just didn\'t get the ball where he wanted.""The Yankees\' lone run came in the third inning on an RBI single by Alex Rodriguez. They stranded 10 and went 1 for 11 with runners in scoring position.""We had a lot of opportunities but weren\'t able to get the big hit,"" Girardi lamented. ""They got the big hit at the end and that\'s why we lost.""New York dropped two of three to the Orioles to complete a 10-game swing through Tampa Bay, Toronto, Detroit and Baltimore with a 4-6 record.T.J. McFarland (1-1) pitched two scoreless innings in relief of Kevin Gausman and Zach Britton got three straight outs for his 17th save.Until the eighth inning, the Yankees stymied a team that scored 37 runs and hit 11 homers in its previous four games.Miller was unavailable because he pitched two innings on Saturday, so Girardi did what he could with his shortened staff.""CC did his job. We knew we had to get a lot of outs out of Chappie today,"" the manager said. ""It\'s a tough loss.Gausman gave up one run and seven hits in six innings. The right-hander owns a decent 3.52 ERA but is winless in nine starts.Sabathia kept the 1-0 lead intact in the bottom of the third by using three pitches to strike out Mark Trumbo with the bases loaded and two outs.Gausman returned the favor in the fourth, striking out Ellsbury after New York filled the bases with two outs.In the fifth, Trumbo again came to the plate with the bases loaded and two outs. As before, Sabathia struck him out on three pitches.""I was just battling,"" Sabathia said. ""I was just trying to do whatever I could to keep us with that one-run lead.""In the seventh, Betances struck out Manny Machado with two outs and a runner on third.TRAINER\'S ROOMYankees: Brian McCann was back behind the plate after missing three starts with a hyperextended elbow.

What if his son, Francisco, came to the plate for the Baltimore Orioles with two outs, the bases loaded and the Yankees clinging to a one-run lead?\xe2\x80\x9cI want him to strike out,\xe2\x80\x9d Pena said with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to win. Honestly. I want to win.\xe2\x80\x9dIt was not quite the ninth inning and Francisco Pena did not deliver the winning hit, but he was there in the middle of the winning rally for the Orioles, who scored three times in the bottom of the eighth inning after a long rain delay to beat the Yankees, 3-1, at Camden Yards.After the rain had delayed the game for 1 hour 37 minutes, Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman came on with runners at first and second and quickly struck out Jonathan Schoop for the second out. But Pena rifled a single to right field hit so hard that it prevented the lead runner, Mark Trumbo, from trying to score \xe2\x80\x94 even after right fielder Aaron Hicks bobbled the ball. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      But pinch-hitter Matt Wieters followed by lining an 0-2 fastball up the middle to drive in Trumbo and Chris Davis, and Pena then scored when center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury\xe2\x80\x99s throw sailed past catcher Brian McCann. Chapman was not backing up home.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The loss was a crushing way to end a 10-game trip for the Yankees, who wasted a plethora of scoring opportunities and another fine effort by starter C. C. Sabathia before falling victim to Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s first blown save in 10 chances.\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t feel sorry for ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d said reliever Dellin Betances, who lost for the second time in this series and has given up runs in four consecutive appearances, a career high. \xe2\x80\x9cThings aren\xe2\x80\x99t going our way. We just have to continue to work.\xe2\x80\x9dAs dispiriting as the loss was for the Yankees, it was uplifting for the Orioles, who moved into a tie for first place with Boston in the American League East, six and a half games ahead of the Yankees.

I just had fun, trying just to make my whole family proud back home in the Dominican Republic watching and my wife and my mom.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Tony Pena was standing in the corner of the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 dugout, his arms folded, when the ball went screaming off the bat of his son into right field. After the loss, the elder Pena was disappointed, but he also surely had some paternal pride.Francisco, a catcher like his father, said he caught his father\xe2\x80\x99s eye once during the game. After chasing down a ball that had skittered away, he glanced toward the first-base coaching box. He also stepped into the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box once and asked McCann, one of many Yankees he knows, if he might do him a favor and call for a fastball.\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was in A-ball, AA, used to go to Yankee Stadium on my day off, so I know all those guys,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pena, 26, who signed with the Mets as a 17-year-old and made his major league debut last year for Kansas City. \xe2\x80\x9cI was messing around with McCann.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Sabathia walked six and hit a batter in five solid innings, but he managed to keep the Orioles scoreless amid muggy, 80-degree conditions.

Girardi caught for 15 seasons in the major leagues.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a brutal position, and there has to be a good amount of toughness in an individual to play that position.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  When Romine was hurt before the start of the ninth inning on Saturday, Pena jogged out with his glove and mask to warm up Chapman. He was quickly called back because Girardi wanted to preserve Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s warm-up tosses for McCann, who was replacing Romine.\xe2\x80\x9cI was not scared for Tony,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said.Pena, a four-time Gold Glove catcher, was in the vanguard of Latino catchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s who brought a flamboyance to the position, sitting on the ground with one leg splayed out and throwing from a crouch. Pena was eager to show off his arm, one of the best in the game.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The younger Pena is indeed more circumspect. He is bigger than his father, at 6 feet 2 inches and 230 pounds, and he displayed a rare sign of exuberance on Sunday when he applauded pitcher Kevin Gausman for a high fastball he threw Ellsbury with the bases loaded in the fourth. Gausman eventually struck Ellsbury out.Tony Pena, who averaged just over six walks for every 100 plate appearances in his 18-year career, said his son had a similar approach at the plate: \xe2\x80\x9cHis strike zone is from the head to the toe. If he throws the rosin bag, he might swing.\xe2\x80\x9dPena\xe2\x80\x99s remark was a spot-on scouting report when the younger Pena fouled off five two-strike pitches and coaxed an 11-pitch walk in his first at-bat. He reached in the fifth on an infield single and took a called third strike in the sixth, at the end of an eight-pitch at-bat against Kirby Yates.

The Baltimore Orioles and the visiting Kansas City Royals are both battling for supremacy in their respective division as they take the fight to each other Monday to open a three-game series. Kansas City squandered the top spot in the American League Central while dropping four straight at Cleveland over the weekend to begin its 10-game road trip. The Royals went into Cleveland on Sunday with a 2 1/2-game lead over the Indians in the division but left on Sunday 1 1/2 back after being outscored 25-6 in the sweep. Kansas City managed three hits in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 7-0 loss and fell to 11-19 on the road with six games left on a trek that also includes three contests against the Chicago White Sox. The Orioles had their own problems on offense Sunday until a rain delay helped the team find its form. Baltimore trailed 1-0 before the delay but pounded out three runs in the eighth against Dellin Betances and Aroldis Chapman to earn a 3-1 victory over the New York Yankees and move back into a virtual tie for first place in the AL East with the Boston Red Sox. PITCHING MATCHUP: Royals LH Danny Duffy (1-0, 3.44 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Mike Wright (2-3, 5.88) Duffy is making his fifth straight start since returning to the rotation and is trying to pick up back-to-back wins. The 27-year-old allowed three runs and seven hits over six innings to pick up a win over Tampa Bay on Wednesday in his longest outing of the campaign. Duffy, who is 2-1 with a 2.25 ERA in six career games (four starts) against Baltimore, has 40 strikeouts and seven walks in 36 2/3 total innings. Wright was bumped from the rotation and sent to Triple-A Norfolk after getting rocked for six runs on seven hits \xe2\x80\x93 four home runs \xe2\x80\x93 in 2 2/3 innings at Boston on Wednesday but found himself back on the Orioles roster when Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day went on the disabled list with a hamstring injury the next day. Wright is likely just keeping the rotation spot warm until Yovani Gallardo (shoulder), who is making a minor-league rehab start on Tuesday, is able to rejoin the rotation. Wright was ripped for five runs on eight hits in 6 1/3 innings to suffer a loss at Kansas City on April 24. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles C Matt Wieters recorded seven RBIs in his last four games. 2. Kansas City DH Kendrys Morales is 1-for-15 with four strikeouts in the last four games, dropping his batting average to .191. 3. Baltimore C Francisco Pena is 4-for-7 with a home run and three runs scored in his first two games this season.

Ironically, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of my least favorite things about the sport. I like my T\xe2\x80\x99s crossed and my I\xe2\x80\x99s dotted, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not big on surprises. But sometimes to win games you have to go off the agenda I suppose, and rain delays will certeainly force teams to do that whether they like it or not.But more on that in a moment.\xc2\xa0Kevin Gausman was solid in his start yesterday, shutting New York down for the most part. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.0 IP, 7 H, 1 R, 2 BB, 5 K. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s lone run given up was on an RBI-single in the third by ARod. NY did get runners on base, however the Gausman and the O\xe2\x80\x99s always found a way to get out of the threat.However NY starter Sabathia shut the Birds down as well for the most part. Whereas we saw several runs scored in the first two games of this series, yesterday we got a pitching duel. And mind you, those are the types of games in which the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t do well. Ironically, this NY team has experience with small ball, because it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the only ways they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to put runs on the board this year.\xc2\xa0Live Feed matt wietersBaltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters Suits Up for His First Game Against Orioles The Baltimore WireWashington Nationals: 5 to watch in Beltway Series District on DeckNationals Matt Wieters: Top fantasy baseball catcher?

Finally the umpires called for the tarp just as a massive storm hit the Inner Harbor with the Orioles batting in the last of the eighth \xe2\x80\x93 with two runners on and one out.Again, rain delays are almost unforeseen, although rain was in the forecast yesterday. It makes things unpredictable, which is part of what makes me nervous. Again, I like to stick to the agenda! But had things stuck to the agenda yesterday, odds are the O\xe2\x80\x99s would have lost 1-0. Sometimes rain has a funny effect on games\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and one hour and thirty-seven minutes later, the rain was over and the game resumed. After Schoop struck out and Pena singled to load the bases, the Orioles sent Matt Wieters up as a pinch hitter. And Wieters delivered, sending a bases-clearing single into centerfield. The third run scored on an errant throw, which also allowed Wieters to go to third.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

All you can really say is that the rain halted the game, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s took the lead following the delay. But putting two runners on base prior to the tarp coming out, the Orioles already were taking some momentum in the game. So it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say.Certainly from New York\xe2\x80\x99s perspective you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to blame the rain because it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the game and it comes off as sounding like an excuse. But from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 side of the coin you take wins however you can get them. This win combined with Boston\xe2\x80\x99s loss put the Orioles in first place once again.

Who\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest pitcher in Orioles history? I gathered a bunch of research to find out.Who is the greatest of all time? It\xe2\x80\x99s the question that\xe2\x80\x99s fueled bar arguments for decades. Who was the greatest quarterback of all time? The greatest pitcher? The greatest NBA player? Everyone has a different opinion, and honestly the question is pretty subjective, but I asked myself, who is the greatest pitcher in Orioles history? Who had the greatest single season in the history of Orioles pitchers? So I combined my love of nerdy statistics that no one else cares about and baseball history to figure\xc2\xa0it out.There were two ways that I went about compiling this data. First, I used what\xe2\x80\x99s called game score, a metric designed by Bill James to numerically measure how well a pitcher pitched. Here\xe2\x80\x99s how game score is measured:Begin with 50 pointsAdd one point for each out recordedAdd two points for each inning completed after the fourthAdd one point for each strikeoutSubtract two points for each allowed hitSubtract four points for each allowed earned runSubtract two points for each allowed unearned runSubtract one point for each allowed walkA game score of 50 is essentially a quality start, anything over 70 is exceptionally good, and below 30 is really bad.With that in mind, I took the game logs of some of the best seasons from Orioles pitchers and figured out their average game score for the year. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the top ten:NameYearAverage Game ScoreDave McNally196868Jim Palmer197264Jim Palmer197364Hoyt Wilhelm195962Jim Palmer197562Mike Cuellar196962Jim Palmer197061Jim Palmer197661Jim Palmer197761Jim Hardin196861\xc2\xa0If you asked any Orioles fan \xe2\x80\x9cwho had the greatest pitching season in team history?\xe2\x80\x9d most of them would probably answer \xe2\x80\x9cProbably Jim Palmer right?\xe2\x80\x9d Now it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that Palmer consists of six of the top ten seasons of all time, but there are a few interesting nuggets in there, like number one; Dave McNally in 1968, when he averaged a game score of 68 on any given night, his best being two nights of an 87 game score: July 11th against the Washington Senators, when he pitched a complete game shutout with six strikeouts and two hits, and August 9th against the California Angels when he threw another complete game shutout with four hits and eight strikeouts.We also have Hoyt Wilhelm\xe2\x80\x99s amazing 1959 year (more on that later), Mike Cuellar\xe2\x80\x99s year in 1969, and Jim Hardin\xe2\x80\x99s year in 1968. Of the top-ten average game scores in the table above, the best individual game score came from Jim Hardin who, on August 19th, 1968, threw a complete game shutout against the California Angels, giving up only two hits, zero walks and eight strikeouts, for a game score of 91.Embed from Getty ImagesNow, you may have noticed that two of the top-ten game score seasons happened in 1968, and that leads me to the second statistic I used in this venture.Statistically speaking, 1968 was a really interesting year for pitchers. It had the lowest league ERA of the modern era (2.98) and the lowest number of runs scored per game of the modern era (3.42). In other words, it was the year of the pitcher, everyone pitched well. There were seven pitchers who finished the 1968 season with sub-2.00 ERAs (including Dave McNally), with the lowest being the current record holder for best season ERA, Bob Gibson, who threw a 1.12 ERA that year.It was because of this that I thought using traditional stats and game score might be a bit misleading. Sure, Dave McNally had an amazing year in 1968, but so did everyone else. What I want to know is, who had the best season relative to the league, who dominated the league?oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dBaltimore Orioles reliever Brad Brach: From afterthought to starring roleMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton Injury Isn't So Devastating2d - MLB: Laz Diaz strikes again - But the pitch was outside, of course2d - Boston Red Sox Coming Down Hard on Racism2d - Baltimore Orioles Zach Britton Out Six to Eight Weeks4d - Are the Red Sox and Orioles baseball's new rivalry?More News at Birds Watcher  To determine this, I took the season ERAs of some of the best pitchers in Orioles history, compared them to the league ERA of that season and calculated the differential. So essentially, the question I was asking was, who most outperformed the rest of the league?The example I like to use to explain why I like this stat is Pedro Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 season with the Red Sox. In 2000, the league ERA was 4.77, the highest of the modern era, right in the midst of the so-called steroid era, and in that season, Pedro Martinez ended the year with a 1.74 ERA. That number alone would be phenomenal in any year, the fact that Pedro was able to have that low of an ERA in a year where 15 different players hit at least 40 home runs (for reference: only six players did it last year and only one did it in 2014) is incredible.So along with game score, I used ERA differential to help determine the greatest season from an Orioles pitcher. There are some similarities in the top ten in ERA differential and the top ten in average game score, but there are some interesting differences:NameYearSeason ERALeague ERADifferentialHoyt Wilhelm19592.193.901.71Jim Palmer19752.093.711.62Jim Palmer19732.403.751.35Mike Cuellar19692.383.611.23Jim Palmer19782.463.691.23Mike Mussina19922.543.751.21Jim Palmer19722.073.261.19Jim Palmer19702.713.891.18Jim Palmer19772.914.001.09Dave McNally19681.952.981.03\xc2\xa0First thing that\xe2\x80\x99s obvious, Palmer dominates again (are we surprised?), as he takes six of the top ten seasons in ERA differential for an Orioles pitcher, though not the same six seasons as game score. With this chart, we also get the most modern pitcher for the Orioles in this article, Mike Mussina in his first full year as a starter with the Orioles, and subsequently, the best year of his career.So which Oriole had the best season in team history? It\xe2\x80\x99s close, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give it to Hoyt Wilhelm in 1959, though Jim Palmer\xe2\x80\x99s 1973 season comes in a close second.Hoyt Wilhelm was an incredible pitcher, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that really needs to be said, the guy is in the Hall of Fame, but it\xe2\x80\x99s true. He had one of the best, if not the best, knuckleballs in baseball history, and in that 1959 season, he caused a major headache for Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 catcher Gus Triandos. Triandos was a big, slow catcher, and that resulted a lot of passed balls when Wilhelm was pitching. In the words of Triandos, \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven is a place where no one throws a knuckleball.\xe2\x80\x9dHere is a fascinating video of Wilhelm talking about his knuckleball, with a little footage of the actual pitch:While mostly known for being a reliever, 1959 was the year that Wilhelm started the most games in his career, and he won the American League ERA title with his 2.19 ERA. However, the next year, the Orioles were blessed with an excess of viable starting pitchers, and Wilhelm moved to the bullpen, starting only on occasion. Eventually he got traded White Sox for Luis Aparicio and Al Smith, and went on to be an excellent closer for Chicago.While Wilhelm had the best season for a pitcher in Orioles history, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say, looking at both the game score and ERA differential stats, that Jim Palmer is statistically the greatest Orioles pitcher of all time. Which, to be honest, is sort of like saying water is wet and fire is hot, we all know this, but to see just how dominate Palmer and other Orioles greats were from a statistic perspective is fascinating.

Machado plays with a huge chip on shoulder, which allows him to play like he\xe2\x80\x99s always trying to prove somebody wrong. Combined with athleticism that is matched by few, if any, in baseball, that makes Machado an incredibly valuable player. That is precisely why he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever put himself in a situation to be suspended.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerFor the record, I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame Machado for his actions against Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura. Ventura went after him three times. During Machado\xe2\x80\x99s second at bat on Tuesday night, Ventura went against what he told catcher Salvador Perez he was going to do twice by throwing inside against him. Factor in Ventura\xe2\x80\x99s reputation and the fact that he had average control at best during the game and the 99 MPH pitch to Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s back was the straw that broke the camel\xe2\x80\x99s back. Manny did nothing to justify that pitch to his back. No amount of trash talk justifies putting a hitter in that situation.At that point, the human body\xc2\xa0loses any sense of rational thought and adrenaline takes over. As a competitor, I know that and therefore, I can\xe2\x80\x99t fault Machado for what he did. Many players likely would have done the same thing. After that pitch to the back, anything short of Machado channeling Juan Marichal on Ventura was a deserved reaction.

Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal11w agoHowever, this needs to be the last time that Machado puts himself in a situation where he can be suspended. He is much too valuable to lose as arguably the best player in baseball. Ventura played mind games with Machado and Machado gave him the reaction that he was looking for.So who really won the battle? Not the Orioles, who will be without Machado for at least five games. The Royals could lose Ventura for 30 games and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really hurt them. Losing Machado clearly hurts the Orioles.Worst of all, Machado put himself in a position where he could have been seriously injured. Granted, Ventura throwing at him three times also put him in a situation where he could have been seriously injured had Ventura missed even slightly with his pitches. However, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t justify charging the mound, an action where a busted jaw or nose are just two of the injuries that could happen..theiaPostSlider_nav._lower{display:none !important}must read: Machado Interested In Long-Term DealWhat\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating is that Machado should have known better. If he\xc2\xa0just jogs to first base, the entire brawl doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. It would have proven that Machado is the bigger man and would have been the equivalent of telling Ventura that he\xe2\x80\x99s not even worth the energy to care about. It\xe2\x80\x99s why stars in hockey rarely fight \xe2\x80\x93 they know their team can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose them for five minutes. While Manny Machado isn\xe2\x80\x99t at fault for the Brawl, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t absolved from responsibility as well.\xc2\xa0oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dBaltimore Orioles reliever Brad Brach: From afterthought to starring roleMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton Injury Isn't So Devastating2d - MLB: Laz Diaz strikes again - But the pitch was outside, of course2d - Boston Red Sox Coming Down Hard on Racism2d - Baltimore Orioles Zach Britton Out Six to Eight Weeks4d - Are the Red Sox and Orioles baseball's new rivalry?More News at Birds Watcher  One good thing came from Machado\xe2\x80\x99s actions (other than three home runs). After the game, Machado accepted responsibility for his actions. In 2014 when he threw his bat, it seemed forced when he did so. On Tuesday night, it appeared that he realized the true magnitude of charging the mound. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t duck like Ventura did and answered every question that he faced. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\xc2\xa0sign of a mature adult.Manny Machado has grown from being an immature kid in 2014 to being a grown man in 2016. Humans make mistakes. With few exceptions, those mistakes don\xe2\x80\x99t define us because humans are flawed. How we respond to those mistakes that we make defines who we are. Machado handled the situation well.In a vacuum, it was awesome to see Manny Machado stand up for himself. Buck Showalter and the rest of his team having his back is a microcosm of the brotherhood that the Orioles have. That brotherhood is why they are more than just the sum of the talent of 25 players. Showalter saying that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any issue with Machado\xe2\x80\x99s response was awesome and it\xe2\x80\x99s why Orioles fans love Buck so much.Next: Orioles win brawl, game against RoyalsManny Machado can\xe2\x80\x99t ever do this kind of thing again. Hopefully this serves as a learning experience for him just like the 2014 bat incident did because Manny Machado is far too valuable a player to lose, even for one game. He is better than he was on Tuesday night. Hopefully he proves that moving forward because with two isolated incidents on his record, his reputation could take a huge hit with one more incident, just like Ventura\xe2\x80\x99s has. "", 'birdswatcher.com'), (""Whatever chemistry's worth, Machado-Ventura brawl shows ..."", ' If one of your co-workers started a fight, would you have their back? It\'s not a hypothetical that most of us have to consider, but in the weird world of baseball, you never really know. A fight like what we saw involving the Orioles and Royals on Tuesday night isn\'t common, yet neither is it entirely unheard of.    There\'s little disputing the genesis of the incident. Kansas City\'s Yordano Ventura blatantly threw a pitch into Manny Machado\'s back. Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports noted that pitch, 99 miles per hour, was the hardest one Ventura had thrown all night.  O\'s manager Buck Showalter was firm in the belief that Ventura shook off his catcher wanting to throw a breaking ball in order to launch the fastball. Machado took exception to the pitch and made his way towards the mound to register his displeasure. A brawl can be thrilling in the moment, but it\'s not something that is a positive overall. When you get two opposing groups of men running at one another with varying levels of anger, all measure of crazy stuff can occur and it\'s not good if it results in an injury. An inciting action like Ventura\'s pitch is also dangerous and can hurt someone.    It would be better for everyone if Machado had not decided to go towards the mound. Better still if Ventura hadn\'t been throwing at Machado on purpose with his hardest pitch of the night, but as the tea-sipping muppet is always saying on the Internet, that\'s none of my business.    What happened isn\'t something that ought to be glorified. It is awfully interesting to break down the reactions of the two teams, though. Team chemistry is one of those slippery concepts that\'s often brought up in lazy baseball analysis, something that\'s cited precisely because there\'s not a lot of ways to prove it or disprove it. Whatever team chemistry is or isn\'t worth, the actions of the Orioles team during the fight and their statements afterward seem to make it pretty clear that they\'ve got it in spades, while the Royals, at least as regards Ventura, do not seem to have any such chemistry.    Take the sparking of the brawl.

Even Francisco Pe\xc3\xb1a is heading into the fracas - you can tell him by his shinguards - and he\'s been here for all of a week. It\'s quite a contrast compared to the response of Royals catcher Salvador Perez. At the outset of the hostilities, no one was closer to Machado than Perez. Machado did not exactly go at full speed to the mound - a 99mph to the back hurts. Perez could have easily caught Machado from behind, had he chosen to. Instead, this happened:      MANNY MANNY MANNY MANNY MANNY!!!! https://t.co/KE5Q5GxyEl\xe2\x80\x94 Eroc RDT (@BarstoolRDT) June 8, 2016    Nor was Perez the only one who seemed to be fed up with Ventura\'s antics.

In his post-game press conference, Royals manager Ned Yost was asked about whether there might be some frustration from other Royals players towards Ventura. ""Ehh,"" he replied, hemming and hawing, then finished, ""Probably."" It seemed to be an uncomfortable presser all around for Yost, who was also asked whose fault he thought the whole situation was. He settled on a mealy-mouthed response of, ""I don\'t know the answer to that."" Showalter was not one for equivocating in his own presser. Asked right off the bat whether he was disappointed in Machado\'s response to being hit, Showalter immediately replied, ""No.""    Another reporter asked whether Showalter thought there would be any more problems coming from the Royals in tonight\'s game. ""Bring it on,"" Showalter said with a shrug.  We saw in Tuesday\'s game how the Orioles are going to respond if something like that happens again. As Showalter also said, ""I didn\'t have much doubt with how they\'d respond."" You come at the king, you best not miss. Hopefully there are no more shenanigans coming. The best way the Orioles can respond is to sweep the series, not do anything that could result in further suspensions or potential injuries. They don\'t need to be paying the price as they go on to face their division competitors in the coming week. At least in Machado\'s case, there might be more than just a suspension coming. He\'ll probably have to pay a fine as well - or at least, a fine will be levied against him. Machado himself may not be the one paying it, as Adam Jones told reporters he would cover the fine himself. That\'s an action that speaks louder than any words, though of course, Jones being Jones, he had plenty of words to say about the situation as well. Jones noted ""the reaction by (the Royals), they weren\'t weren\'t too happy that (he) did something stupid.""    And as far as Machado goes, Jones said, ""I\'m glad for Manny for defending himself. Someone is trying to hurt you maliciously, you go out there and defend yourself.""  Only Ventura can know for sure how much malice there was in a 99mph fastball to the back, but it sure seems like a malicious action, and it\'s very clear that the Orioles as a team feel like Machado did what he had to do and they don\'t hold that against him. There aren\'t a whole lot of people who I\'d sprint across a field to back up in a fight. Each Oriole has 24 guys who he knows will back him up. Maybe it\'s not worth anything at all that the Orioles seem to be united in support of one of their teammates being in a fight. It surely doesn\'t hurt anything either.   ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

It\'s a much less exciting time for Orioles fans than it was back in the bad old days, when the Orioles had picks in the top five or ten every year, but it remains an important day because the draft will always be the best way to add cost-effective talent into the O\'s farm system.    Where teams who have been bad and probably will remain bad for the near future are going to be getting their pick of names like Mickey Moniak, Jason Groome, A.J. Puk, and Nick Senzel, the Orioles, in all likelihood, don\'t even know for sure who will be available at their top pick at 27th overall. A team that drafts and develops well can still get value out of later picks. Two-fifths of the current Orioles rotation came from outside of the first round in 2011, with Mike Wright getting drafted in the third round and Tyler Wilson being picked in the tenth round. That\'s what the O\'s can hopefully pull off this year. Where, when, and how to watch Thanks to the magic of television and the Internet, you can have MLB Network\'s coverage of the draft beamed towards your eyeballs rather than you having to go to Secaucus, NJ in order to find it.    Their coverage will begin at 6pm Eastern tonight, with the draft itself beginning at 7pm. You can also follow on MLB.com, where there will be a live-updating draft tracker.    The Orioles picks tonight The day 1 coverage will go through the first 77 picks. That means that the Orioles will get to pick three times tonight.  Pick #27 comes as compensation for losing Wei-Yin Chen in free agency. Pick #54 is the Orioles\' regular second round pick. The 69th overall selection is compensation for not signing last year\'s second round pick, Jonathan Hughes.    The Orioles will NOT be picking at #14 or at #76, the former due to signing Yovani Gallardo, the latter due to dumping the pick in order to get the Braves to eat Brian Matusz\'s salary. History of the 27th overall pick If you go back from now to 1965, when the first draft was held, there are a whopping total of five players who ever got more than 10 WAR at the big league level. The most recent of these was Rick Porcello, drafted at this spot in 2007.  Another was the O\'s pick in 1987: Pete Harnisch, whose 18.2 career WAR the O\'s didn\'t get to enjoy because of the Glenn Davis trade. So while the O\'s could find a good player, and should try their best to do so, keep your expectations tempered, no matter what the prospect-industrial complex says about whoever the O\'s take.    The Orioles bonus pool The O\'s will be able to spend just about $6.7 million on signing their picks in the top ten rounds without incurring any penalties. A team can exceed that amount by up to 5% and just pay a tax on the overage. More than 5% and there are steeper penalties, but as of yet no team has incurred any lost pick penalties. That sounds like a lot of money, but it\'s actually only the 21st-largest draft bonus pool. Not to beat a dead horse, but if it weren\'t for the Gallardo signing and the Matusz trade, the O\'s would have a top ten bonus pool. What this means is that the O\'s likely won\'t be able to get creative and draft any talented high school players who are falling due to bonus demands. The last wave of Orioles mock drafts Nobody knows who the Orioles will have left to choose from, so nobody, even the Orioles, knows exactly who they will take with their top pick. The various publications that cover the draft have taken their best guesses on the morning of round 1, so you can at least get an idea of who the O\'s maybe are thinking about. T.J. Zeuch - RHP - Pittsburgh - ESPN\'S Keith Law has the O\'s picking this 6\'7"" righty with their top pick. Other publications rate Zeuch in the 20s though Law has him at #38. Has hit up to 97. Throws four pitches but the offspeed offerings need some work.    Buddy Reed - OF - Florida - Baseball America puts the O\'s on Reed, whom they rate as the 33rd best prospect. Another publication calls him ""one of the best athletes"" in the class but thinks the switch-hitter\'s swing needs some work. Should stick in center field. Reed grew up in Finksburg although he went to high school in Rhode Island before heading to Florida for college. Kyle Muller - LHP - Jesuit College Prep (TX)  - MLB.com\'s Jim Callis has the O\'s taking Muller, who rates 24th on their draft board. The 6\'5"" lefty hit up to 95 this spring and one crosschecker said of him, ""If there\'s a better body in the draft, I\'d like to see it."" Josh Lowe - 3B/OF - Pope HS (GA) - MLB.com\'s Jonathan Mayo brings up Lowe\'s name with the O\'s. In most other mocks I have seen over the last month, this two-way player is long gone by #27. They rate him as the 17th best prospect: ""quick, controlled left-handed swing ... plus speed and arm strength"" and could work at 3B or even CF. Maybe the Orioles will end up drafting one of these guys. They probably won\'t get a chance to draft more than one, as it\'s all but certain that all four will be gone by the time the O\'s second choice rolls around.

06/10/2016,"[('Four Orioles Make Top 100 MLB Players List \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' BALTIMORE (WJZ) \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0CBS Sports recently shared their updated list of the Top 100 players in Major League Baseball. As we\xe2\x80\x99re about a third of the way through the 2016 season, the updated list\xc2\xa0looks a bit different and four Orioles players have made the\xc2\xa0cut. Back in April, before the\xc2\xa0season started, the\xc2\xa0group\xc2\xa0looked a bit different with Orioles players like Chris Davis and Adam Jones making the list, but the two have since dropped off to be replaced in the lineup by some of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 prime pitchers. Manny Machado moved up a few spots from his April ranking of No. 7 to No. 3, just behind Clayton Kershaw and\xc2\xa0Mike Trout. \xe2\x80\x9cMachado boasts elite defense at third, and he\xe2\x80\x99s good enough with the glove that he\xe2\x80\x99s logged the majority of his defensive innings at short this season. He\xe2\x80\x99s also on pace for 107 extra-base hits.\xe2\x80\x9d Mark\xc2\xa0Trumbo made the list with his\xc2\xa0league-leading 19 homers, 44 RBIs and a .295 batting average. So far this June, Trumbo has nine hits, eight runs scored, seven RBI and four home runs, all in six games. He\xe2\x80\x99s ranked No. 39 out of 100 on the list. \xe2\x80\x9cOver the years, Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s improved his ability to lay off pitches outside the zone, and this season he\xe2\x80\x99s having a career year. He\xe2\x80\x99s slugging .593 and on pace for 53 bombs,\xe2\x80\x9d noted\xc2\xa0Dayn Perry. Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman also made the list this round. After a slightly disappointing 2015 season, Tillman is \xe2\x80\x9cback to pitching like a near-ace. In fact, his current ERA+ of 130 would be a career-best qualifying mark.\xe2\x80\x9d Another Orioles pitcher made the list at No. 95, Zach Britton\xc2\xa0has\xc2\xa0allowed just three runs all season, and opposing hitters in 2016 have a line of .139/.190/.215 against him. \xc2\xa0  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Subs Getting the Job Done', 'Jun 7, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles outfielder Hyun Soo Kim (25) rounds the bases in the first inning against the Kansas City Royals at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles won 9-1. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have won five in a row and eight of the last nine games, and without doubt the subs and utility players have had a big role in this success.The contributions have not only been at the plate. For example, Ryan Flaherty has had a number of fine defensive plays including taking away a base hit from Encarnacion to end the 6-5 victory over the Blue Jays last night.With the way Buck Showalter shuffles his lineup and uses the bench, it is not immediately obvious as to who would qualify as a substitute. For example, Joey Rickard is more of a sub than a starter right now, but that was not true at the beginning of the season.But let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at some of the players who don\xe2\x80\x99t (or previously didn\xe2\x80\x99t) play daily and consider their contributions over this most recent streak of nine games in June.Hyun Soo Kim \xe2\x80\x93 We are beginning to see why Kim had the nickname of \xe2\x80\x9cthe hitting machine\xe2\x80\x9d in the Korean League. One of the several strange stories of this 2016 season is how Kim turned around a horrible spring and an early season benching (for the most part) into a highly successful run since playing more regularly.He has now started 21 of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 59 games and is batting .366 overall. Though only 1-for-4 last night, it was a key leadoff double in the top of the ninth that set up the tie-breaking, game-winning run to score.Kim is hitting 12-for-33 in June for an average of .364. He surely seems to have made the adjustment to American baseball, though I\xe2\x80\x99d love to know what he truly had going through his mind when running onto the field during the Machado-Ventura fight on Tuesday night.Ryan Flaherty \xe2\x80\x93 Not a favorite son here on The Baltimore Wire, but we acknowledge his key roles of late. This is proving especially helpful with Hardy still out and with Machado headed for suspension time.In these nine games of June, Flash has been 6-for-23 along with five walks. This has given some offensive help in turning over the lineup, while also contributing as always with his glove. Ryan had a key hit on Wednesday night that broke open a low-scoring game. We might need to begin being nicer to Flaherty here \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe, just maybe.Pedro Alvarez \xe2\x80\x93 In the big picture of things, getting Alvarez for this already power-packed team has not looked like the best offseason move. But he has hit better of late, driving a key home run last night to help bring the Orioles back from trailing early in the game.El Toro has started eight of the nine June games and is 9-for-28 (.321) with three home runs. Might the Orioles have to endure his play at third base for a few games with Manny being gone? If he keeps hitting, that would be tolerable.Nolan Reimold \xe2\x80\x93 All he does is get on base over and over. Nolan has been doing it all year and not getting rusty when so often just stuck waiting around to play. He is only 2-for-11 in June, but add four walks to that number. Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s season OBP is .367.Francisco Pena \xe2\x80\x93 Brought up as a defensive catcher to fill the role of the injured Caleb Joseph, he is 5-for-11 in his three games played, along with a big home run; and his catching and game-calling has been superb.

And they have won in varied fashions, with big 13-9 and 12-7 wins over the Red Sox, while also only giving up two runs in the four prior games to last evening. But that is what good teams do; they find a way to win every type of ballgame. And at 36-23, it has to be admitted that the Orioles are a pretty good team.

06/11/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Corner Outfield Production in 2016', 'May 25, 2016; Houston, TX, USA; Baltimore Orioles designated hitter Mark Trumbo (45) is congratulated by right fielder Nolan Reimold (14) after scoring a run during the sixth inning against the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsA look at basic statistics demonstrates that the Baltimore Orioles have made a definitive improvement in offensive production from the corner outfield positions.This advance has contributed much to the Orioles (in spite of last night\xe2\x80\x99s 10th inning loss) having a 36-24 record that is only a half-game from being the best in the American League. This pace of winning three out of every five games may not seem to be terribly awesome, but it does set up a 97-win season if maintained to the end. That will work!Right field and left field were major concerns going into the most recent offseason, and a quick look at the 2015 numbers would show why. Production from O\xe2\x80\x99s left fielders in particular was among the worst in the league.A connected discussion with this is also what comes from the designated hitter role, as corner outfielders (at least on the Orioles) make up a bulk of the at-bats for DH.Here are comparative stats from 2015 / 2016 for these three positions, noting batting average, on-base percentage, and home runs from one year to the next. The rank for each stat speaks of where the number placed the Orioles among American League teams\xe2\x80\xa6Avg><RankOBP><RankHR><Rank15 RF.2754th.3189th249th16 RF.2924th.3635th123rd15 LF.21014th.28713th188th 16 LF.2863rd.3435th99th 15 DH.2537th.30811th1411th16 DH.2429th.3187th171st\xc2\xa0Right Field 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 The 2015 stats in RF are always a bit surprising, as memory does not seem to recall the numbers as having a fourth-best ranking in batting average, for example. Twelve different players spent some time out there, with Gerrardo Parra having the most games \xe2\x80\xa6 just 43. Delmon Young had 40 and Chris Davis 30, hitting nine homers in those 30 games. So the position was not a total loss in spite of the revolving door of others who brought down the total numbers. But the RF situation was very unsettled for the entire season.Right Field 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 There is still a shifting of players from day to day in right field, but the status is greatly improved over a year ago. Mark Trumbo has more than half of the at-bats from RF with 117 and a .333 average. Nolan Reimold is .308 from his time at the position. It is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s 15-for-68 (.221) that keeps the numbers from being truly stellar this year.Left Field 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 These are ugly, ugly numbers. It was a year-long struggle with David Lough at .218 and Steve Pearce at .214. Of the 575 at-bats last year from O\xe2\x80\x99s left fielders, only 108 from Reimold and four from Flaherty are still with the Orioles. And that constitutes good news and good change.Left Field 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s early season got the Orioles off to a good start in left field, and his current average from that position is .256.\xc2\xa0 Hyun Soo Kim will soon have more at-bats from this place and his current .337/.414 has greatly bolstered the left field position. Reimold adds an additional 13-for-50 with a pair of home runs. This is altogether a massive improvement over 2015.Designated Hitter 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 The only thing keeping these numbers from being rather horrid was Jimmy Paredes catching fire for half a season with a .279 average in 81 games. Beyond that, there is little we would want to remember about designated hitters in 2015.Designated Hitter 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Apart from two games with Matt Wieters at DH (a role that he has never done well with), this is evenly split between Mark Trumbo and Pedro Alvarez. The 17 home runs (11 by Trumbo, 6 by Alvarez) ties for best in the American League (with some dude from Boston) and is already three more than came from the entire 2015 season. We would like to see a higher batting average, but the power numbers are doing much to make up for that.

Trumbo is the big difference; can he keep up the pace for the whole year? On that theme, can the recent resurgence of Kim be largely sustained? Reimold has been steady.

Adding their eight day two picks to the ones they made on Thursday night, the Orioles have now drafted eight pitchers, six of whom come from the college ranks.    My pick recap for the O\'s three day one picks, including top pick Cody Sedlock from the University of Illinois, can be found here. The most notable pick the Orioles made on the second day of the draft was not a pitcher at all, though. That would be their seventh round pick, Preston Palmeiro, a first baseman from North Carolina State University. Yes, that Palmeiro. Preston is Rafael\xe2\x80\x99s son. A 6\xe2\x80\x990"" lefty batter, the younger Palmeiro is built like his father, and apparently swings like him, too. That\xe2\x80\x99s according to the elder Palmeiro himself, who spoke to Dan Connolly of Baltimore Baseball on Friday evening after Preston was drafted.    Rafael Palmeiro told Connolly that the O\xe2\x80\x99s reached out to the family before the draft to ask whether there would be too much baggage involved for the family with the O\xe2\x80\x99s drafting Preston. ""We were totally all in,"" said the former Oriole.    It\'s actually a bit of a surprise that the son of a major leaguer slipped as low as the seventh round. Those kinds of players usually go earlier. Perhaps it\'s because the Palmeiro name makes things complicated, or perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s because he\'s not yet got the power teams would look for in a first baseman. Preston Palmeiro was ranked as the 292nd prospect on the Baseball America 500.    The elder Palmeiro, admittedly a biased source of information, thinks his son will develop power with maturity and also believes N.C. State\xe2\x80\x99s home stadium is a bad one for power hitters. That\'s not true of Oriole Park at Camden Yards, as Palmeiro knows as well as anyone. A parade of high schoolers Starting in the fourth round, the Orioles picked three straight players from the high school ranks. Two are pitchers: Fourth round pick Brenan Hanifee, from Bridgewater, VA, and sixth rounder Tobias Myers, from Winter Haven, FL. In the fifth round they grabbed shortstop Alexis Torres from Colegio Angel David in Puerto Rico. Hanifee, #181 on the BA500, is the best rated prospect of the three of these. He is interesting as well because, as the MLB.com draft broadcast relayed on Friday, Hanifee\xe2\x80\x99s father is an Orioles fan who even has an Orioles tattoo. Hanifee himself, from some of his tweets, sure looks like he\'s been an O\'s fan for a while.    Many Virginians have given in to their historic tendency to turn traitor in recent years, but it seems the Hanifee family is not among them - and now that Hanifee is in the O\xe2\x80\x99s system, I\'m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s an even stronger tie. The draft broadcast labeled the 6\xe2\x80\x994"" Hanifee as ""projectable, maybe even ultra-projectable,"" which usually reflects a belief that the player could add velocity as his frame fills out. Hanifee is listed at 185 lbs., which is not a lot for a professional baseball player of that height. Baseball America\xe2\x80\x99s Michael Lananna hinted that the O\xe2\x80\x99s may have snagged Hanifee before the Pirates, who were interested, could take him. (Correction: The Pirates in this tweet appears to actually refer to the East Carolina University Pirates, where Hanifee is committed to attend.) Torres, the shortstop, received this report from Fangraphs back in November:  Torres has the obvious tools to play the infield, but his footwork and transfer to release skills are a bit lacking for a prototypical shortstop. At the plate, he has an excellent hand path with tons of athleticism in his swing. Right now his swing and build don\xe2\x80\x99t project to give him even average power, but average or better grades across the board otherwise make him a very intriguing player to follow.     Torres is listed at 6\xe2\x80\x990"" and 183 lbs. The concern about his build brings to mind another high school shortstop the O\'s drafted a few years ago, 2012\xe2\x80\x99s third rounder Adrian Marin, listed at 6\xe2\x80\x990"" and 180 lbs. Marin is a fringy hitter who\xe2\x80\x99s never developed the power - for Bowie this year, he\xe2\x80\x99s batting .227/.288/.307. Not much harm in taking a stab at a similar player, this time in the fifth round, to see if he develops differently. Myers, the Florida pitcher, was deep on the BA500 at #324. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what they had to say about him:  Myers had some early buzz this spring after he touched 93 mph with his fastball, but has more typically pitched around 90 mph. He combines his fastball with a solid curveball and a seldom-used changeup. Myers is a good athlete and has a loose, easy delivery that he repeats well. He earns praise for his pitchability. Listed at 6-foot-1, 175 pounds, there is some projection to him, particularly because has been a two-way player in high school.  I don\'t know where they get 6\xe2\x80\x991"" and 175 lbs. as he\xe2\x80\x99s listed by the Orioles as 6\xe2\x80\x990"" and 190, but hey, the world of obscure prospects is a predictably vague place.    MLB Advanced Media produced a short video package from an outing Myers had last July:  Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect too much from a sixth round pick on general principle - but, if a sixth round pick was going to surprise you, Myers achieving some of the projection that the BA scouting report mentions is one way it might happen. Back to the college ranks The first Orioles pick of the day was a college outfielder: Austin Hays from Jacksonville University, picked in the third round. They went high school for three picks as outlined above, then added Palmeiro before closing the day with three pitchers. Those pitchers are Ryan Moseley, a righty from Texas Tech, picked in the eighth round; Lucas Humpal, a righty from Texas State, picked in the ninth round; and Cody Dube of Keene State College (NH), picked in the tenth round of the draft. Humpal and Dube are both college seniors, meaning they are likely just players who will sign for a small signing bonus. That will allow the Orioles to use some of that slot money on signing some of their other draft picks. This is a common strategy for teams.    In general - though of course there are always exceptions - college players with the most potential have been drafted and signed before they become seniors. Hays, the highest-drafted position player by the Orioles this year, was described on the draft broadcast after his selection as ""the rare toolsy college outfielder."" The label ""toolsy"" is more typically put on high school draftees who are more athletes bringing skills to baseball than polished baseball players yet. The people at BA were highest on Hays, rating him as their 47th prospect for the draft. That makes him an interesting potential value pick; getting the #47 guy at #91 is how you have a good draft. Others rated him lower, with Baseball Prospectus bringing him in at #80 and MLB.com putting him 120th. Still, even the lowest rated one at MLB gave him this scouting report:  The right-handed Floridian uses a short and handsy swing to consistently make the ball jump off his bat. Hays doesn\'t waste a lot of motion and has shown both the ability to hit for average and power, albeit it in a weaker conference. It might be more doubles power at the next level, but Hays has shown over-the-fence ability is in there. His plus arm also profiles well in right field, where he is a very capable defender.     With the caveat that almost everybody sounds like a future big leaguer in their MLB.com scouting report, that sounds like a fine player to get to add in the third round of the draft, especially considering he\xe2\x80\x99s an outfielder and the Orioles minor league outfield depth is almost nonexistent. Moseley, the Texas Tech pitcher, is not anywhere to be found on the BA500. That may sound problematic, but he was actually a pick that excited Jim Callis and Jonathan Mayo on the draft broadcast. Before this year, Moseley was seen as a potential first round pick on the strength of his first two seasons in the Texas Tech rotation. The hiccup that sent him down to the eighth round is that he was pulled from the rotation after only three starts this year. The problem? His ""control and command aren\xe2\x80\x99t sharp."" Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a familiar story. He may be a future reliever, although MLB\xe2\x80\x99s scouting capsule says pro clubs, presumably including the Orioles, aren\'t ready to kick him to the bullpen forever just yet. Maybe the most interesting thing about Moseley is this: ""His primary weapon is a 91-95mph fastball with power sink."" Every time the Orioles draft a pitcher whose sinker is his best pitch, an angel gets its wings. They could do a whole lot worse than collecting a bunch of sinkerballers, seeing who\xe2\x80\x99s good enough to move up the ladder, and going from there.     A best case scenario for the deeper rounds of this draft would probably be something like the O\'s 2013 draft, where, three years later, despite Hunter Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s injury problems, the Orioles still have five players with at least a little bit of prospect potential - and two more, Stephen Tarpley and Steven Brault, were pieces in a trade. Never mind that the Travis Snider trade was terrible, it speaks well of the O\xe2\x80\x99s scouting staff that they found a third rounder and an eleventh rounder who could be traded for a big leaguer. Best of luck to all of these picks, and the ones who will be drafted today, in their professional careers. Hopefully a few years down the road we will get to see them having success in an Orioles uniform.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The Orioles and Red Sox are each 11 games over, Toronto is four games over, and the Yankees are one game over and the Rays are three games under (as of 530 p.m. Saturday.)Three games under is by far the best worst team in a division. In fact, 11 teams have records worse than the Rays.Baltimore and Boston are the fourth and fifth-best teams in the game, behind only the Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers and Washington Nationals.In the Wild Card, the Red Sox lead, Toronto is only 1.5 back of the second wild card, the Yankees only 3 back, and Tampa 5.So, what does this all mean? What it means is that the division, and the games between divisional teams, are going to be dogfights.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('MLB Draft results 2016: Complete list of Orioles picks ...', ' The Orioles completed their 2016 draft on Saturday afternoon as they and the rest of the MLB teams burned through rounds 11-40 on the third day of the draft. This year, they were able to make 41 selections over the draft\xe2\x80\x99s 40 rounds.    Most of the Orioles picks were pitchers. They drafted 14 position players and took 27 pitchers. Among the pitchers, 12 are left-handed and 15 are right-handed. For the position players, nine are infielders and five are outfielders. They did not select a catcher. They picked 31 college players and ten high schoolers, with only three high schoolers in the first ten rounds. The others may be tougher signs. Of the college players, six came from the junior college ranks and the rest from four year schools. Ten are seniors, with one draft-eligible sophomore and the other 14 being juniors. Recent history suggests that the Orioles will be signing a large majority of these picks. They\xe2\x80\x99ve signed at least 30 players every year since 2012 when the current draft slotting system came into place.    There have only been two occasions where they failed to sign a pick in the top ten rounds, the most recent of which was last year\xe2\x80\x99s second rounder, Jonathan Hughes. That gave them an extra second round pick this year. If a top ten rounds pick doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sign, they lose the value of that draft slot from their draft pool.    Included in this year\xe2\x80\x99s draft class are two sons of former Orioles: seventh round pick Preston Palmeiro, son of Rafael, and 13th round pick Brandon Bonilla, son of Bobby. The Orioles previously drafted the younger Bonilla in the 25th round two years ago. The Orioles will have about $6.7 million they will be allowed to spend on these picks. Anyone taken from the 11th round and on can sign for up to $100,000 without counting against the bonus pool. They can exceed this amount by up to 5% without any lost draft pick penalties.

If the Orioles are lucky, this draft class will turn out like the one of 2013, where several years later a number of the later-round picks still have at least a bit of prospect potential.

06/13/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles almost come all the way back', ""The Baltimore Orioles almost were able to come all the way back to tie Toronto, after Ubaldo Jimenez didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it out of the first inning.The Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 situation with\xc2\xa0Ubaldo Jimenez might have come to a head yesterday in Toronto. Jimenez didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it out of the first inning of the game, giving up five runs on four doubles. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 0.1 IP, 6 H, 5 R, 0 BB, 1 K.The Orioles brought\xc2\xa0Vance Worley in for Jimenez, and he was able to make it to the fifth inning with some success. It would seem to me that it would be easy enough to simply swap Jimenez into the bullpen and Worley into the rotation, however as is generally the case I suspect that\xe2\x80\x99s a bit overly simplistic. In fact, with Worley pitching yesterday it would put him right on track with Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s rotation spot (along with today being an off day). But there\xe2\x80\x99s a stark difference between me saying this in today\xe2\x80\x99s column, and actually doing it. As I said, I make it sound very easy when in fact it probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t.The BIrds did get a run back in the second on a Flaherty RBI-single, however before you could bat an eye it was 7-1 Toronto. But the O\xe2\x80\x99s were going to make a run of this. Incidentally, make no mistake about the fact that the Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly kind to Toronto pitching in this series. They may have dropped three of the four games, but they squared a lot of balls up and hit lots of home runs.

I hear a lot of fans saying the O\xe2\x80\x99s should trade for a starting pitcher. Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s easier said than done. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a contingent of people who think the Orioles should just DFA Jimenez and be done with him. As has been said ad hoc, that would be an incredibly poor business move on the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 part. They would be paying him for the next year-and-a-half, most probably to pitch against them. Not smart.Obviously if they trade for a starter, they\xe2\x80\x99d still have to figure out what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do with Jimenez. Having said all of that, given that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it out of the first inning yesterday it would be an ideal time for some small injury to send him to the DL. Yes folks, I get it \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of shady in a way. But it happens all the time.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles and Mike Wright battle but fall in TorontoAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve alluded already, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have are off today in Boston. What will the roster look like in regards to the pitching staff when they get going again tomorrow night? Tough to say now, but time will tell. "", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('An idea for the Orioles to fix Mike Wright - Camden Chat', "" Mike Wright has all of the component parts of a good pitcher. He is listed at 6\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d 215 lbs. He is a big hulking right handed pitcher that can hit 99 mph on the gun while having four other pitches in his arsenal.     To top it all off he has the stamina and endurance to maintain his stuff as the game goes on. Yet, Mike Wright has a career 5.62 ERA and none of his peripheral statistics indicate anything other than he is a bad pitcher. He does not strike enough batters out, he walks too many, and he cannot keep the ball in the ballpark. All of this is due to lack of command and lack of consistency.  I would say that this is mostly anecdotal, but from what I can tell from watching the games. Command and consistency are hard to quantify. Yet, we can try. To try to put it simply, the lowest Isolated Power (ISO) allowed on any of Mike Wright\xe2\x80\x99s pitches during his career is his sinker at .162.  A .162 is an above average power hitter in the major leagues. That is his best pitch from a results standpoint. His four seam fastball sits a .186 ISO. All of his breaking pitchers are at or above .200. While his pitches have good velocity and decent movement they all get hammered by opposing batters.     From my eyes, he struggles with repeating his delivery in particular on his breaking balls. Some look sharp, others are flat. On his change up, he can at times telegraph his delivery by slowing his whole body down to release the pitch slower.     All of these pitches flash enough to get the job done, but at this point, in his age 26 season, the time for Wright to learn how to be an effective major league starter is waning. The Orioles, while certainly lacking for other quality fill in candidates, cannot afford to keep Wright in the rotation for long.  Even if he is sent to AAA with the idea towards starting, I have doubts that anything can be changed this late in the game. So what can be done, let\xe2\x80\x99s change Mike Wright into a reliever.     Most quality relievers are failed starters. In the bullpen, going only one inning at a time, the game can be simplified. The times through the order penalty goes down. A pitcher can more of a thrower. While converting Mike Wright to the bullpen we are going to scrap some of his pitches as well.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s make the game as simple as possible. All of his fastballs are going to be sinkers now. For the off speed, were keeping the slider and throwing everything else out. A sinker/slider right handed reliever. I picked those two pitches for two reasons.  First, those have been his best two of his throughout his career. While neither have gotten good results, both are his best. Opponents are only hitting .254 on his slider, and while they are hitting .338 on his sinker, it gets ground balls. Mike Wright gets ground balls on 11.59 percent of his sinkers.     For comparison, Zach Britton gets ground balls on 15.29 percent of his sinkers. Give me that kind of ground ball rate and I have got something to work with as a reliever.  Furthermore, Wright gets Whiffs on those two pitches the most. He actually gets Whiffs on his change up more often than his other pitches, but his change up is also crushed to outer space a good deal more. Whiffs and ground balls are what we are looking for.  Second, Wright appears to command these pitches better than other ones. These pitches are consistently down in the zone. This year, only his curve ball has been on average located lower than his sinker and slider and it's only by .01 feet lower than his slider. Not only that, last year the curve ball was located much higher in the zone, again a lack of consistency with the pitch.          When Wright throws his sinker and slider the pitches are located better, get better results, and still have the velocity and movement that he needs to be an effective pitcher. A sinker/slider starter rarely works, but coming out of the bullpen it could be lethal.  Mike Wright currently averages a tad under 94 mph on his sinker and 84 mph on his slider. While only being asked to work one inning a time, it is possible\xe2\x80\x94if not likely\xe2\x80\x94that his velocity could go up. The ground balls and whiffs those two pitches have been able to get thus far are impressive.    Sending Wright down to AAA and giving him only two pitches to work on, two pitches to command, two pitches to repeat, and two pitches to be consistent with gives him a chance to succeed where he has failed. Otherwise, the Orioles are going to keep finding themselves trying to work out of big deficits.   "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('The Orioles are paying a price for trying to save money on ...', "" The Orioles starting rotation is a unit loaded up with problems. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be this way, but the struggles of Ubaldo Jimenez and the injury to Yovani Gallardo have exposed the lack of depth in the Orioles system for MLB-ready starting pitching.    Things didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be this way, either. They had another choice for depth who they could have kept around. That was Miguel Gonzalez, who was released at the end of spring training in order to save about $3.5 million in salary. With what\xe2\x80\x99s gone on with the starting rotation since Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s departure, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the Orioles are now paying the price for trying to save money on Gonzalez. Jimenez is the obvious culprit for a starting pitcher who needs to lose his spot if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t abruptly right his ship, but he\xe2\x80\x99s hardly the only one who would be on the hot seat - or at least not the only one if he was in an organization with real pitching depth.     The Orioles are not such an organization, which is why their two players who pass for pitching depth, Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson, are currently in the starting rotation rather than waiting in the wings. In the long run the O\xe2\x80\x99s may find that neither one belongs.    The problem with ditching Gonzalez For now, the Orioles could use Gonzalez. They didn't have to release him, even if they were convinced he was incapable of contributing to the 2016 rotation right at the start of the season. They could have used a minor league option to send him to Norfolk, giving him time to either regain his form or at least be available as a better emergency option than Odrisamer Despaigne. At the time, that specific move made some sense because Gonzalez did not have a good spring, so it was fair to wonder whether he had just reached the end of the line. He barely touched 90mph on the radar gun in any of his spring starts and his 87-88mph pitches were not being treated kindly by professional hitters.    However, we have since seen Gonzalez surface in the White Sox organization, where, since things are a mess, they quickly called on Gonzalez at the big league level even though he only signed a minor league contract. Even after Chicago made a big, surprising acquisition of James Shields, they still have kept Gonzalez around, choosing to release the struggling Mat Latos instead. No wonder they have kept Gonzalez in their rotation when seeing what he\xe2\x80\x99s done so far. I say this without having watched him in action, but a cursory perusal of his season numbers reveals a guy who still has some value, one whom the Orioles made a poor decision to cast aside so easily. If the radar gun was the worry, Gonzalez has dispelled that, at least up to now. His average fastball velocity so far his 91.2mph, right in line with where he worked in his successful big league campaigns in 2013 and 2014. It's hard to argue, too, with his ERA of 3.57. That would look good in the O's rotation.    It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that there are some red flags as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s only been seven starts. Things may look differently after another seven starts. And even for now, there\xe2\x80\x99s some concern that he\xe2\x80\x99s averaging less than 5.2 innings per start he makes, while carrying a higher batting average against (.258) and WHIP (1.364) than he did in any of his good Orioles years. Still, if the Orioles had been willing to absorb the entirety of Gonzalez's $5.1 million salary and just have him in Norfolk, they could have been the ones to look up and see what he has left. Now they are paying the price for pinching pennies over his salary. A baseball team can always get more money. It can\xe2\x80\x99t just shake a tree and have a guy with two and a half successful big league seasons under his belt fall out of it. Which brings to mind one question: Why did they do it? There must be some answer, but the Orioles probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be telling it. What made the Gonzalez release strange at the time, and leaves it feeling strange still, is that the Orioles conducted both their offseason, and spring training, spending as if a few million dollars wasn't going to make or break the bank. The Orioles shelled out big bucks to keep Chris Davis, moderate bucks to keep Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, and found themselves on the hook for the qualifying offer to Matt Wieters. They made a modest commitment to Hyun Soo Kim.     Once spring training arrived, they still signed Yovani Gallardo to a deal that will pay him $6.5 million this year (not counting deferred money) and also Pedro Alvarez to a deal worth up to $7 million. And let's not forget the strange almost-signing of Dexter Fowler, which, according to what was being reported at the time, was supposed to be a three year signing worth $11 million per year. It\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say the Orioles wouldn't have added Alvarez if they had gotten Fowler into the fold, but they would have been spending a few million dollars more as well. Why make these last moves if they were scraping up against the limit of the budget, or even going beyond it? Were the Orioles planning how to dump some salary as soon as they signed Alvarez? Were they expecting to shave off a few million from the payroll when they believed they were very close to a deal with Fowler? Fowler could well have seemed like a player who was worth busting the budget a bit to sign. With how he\xe2\x80\x99s playing so far this year, batting .295/.403/.496 in 59 games, they would have been right about that. But could they have possibly believed that Alvarez was worth smashing through their budget number? This is something that it is hard to imagine being true. What if Gonzalez had a good spring training? How would the Orioles have peeled away $3.5 million in payroll then? They might have released Vance Worley, saving about $2 million, or even Brian Matusz during spring training, saving $3 million. But maybe it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even about the money. Maybe they just gave up on Gonzalez too soon.    I wonder whether the much-discussed drop in attendance at Camden Yards has played a role in some of their payroll-shaving maneuvering, including the salary dump trade of Matusz to the Braves. Compared to their first 35 gates last season, O\xe2\x80\x99s attendance is down about 18%. That\xe2\x80\x99s not all the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fault. Lots of bad early weather surely played a factor, as well as a lack of any weekend series against the Red Sox, or even the Yankees struggles drawing fewer of their bandwagon fans. These things add up. But maybe they made some optimistic revenue forecasts that just haven't borne out. They\xe2\x80\x99d hardly be the first company to ever do so. Maybe they believed they\xe2\x80\x99d sell the same number of tickets, just at this year\xe2\x80\x99s increased price. Since that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t proved true perhaps they\xe2\x80\x99re harder up for cash than they should be. Whatever it is, the O's must be smarter If it was about the money, the Orioles need to not overspend their budget in the future so they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to make any short-sighted salary dump moves like releasing Gonzalez or trading Matusz. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about the money and it was just about deciding Gonzalez was toast, the Orioles need to be more patient in their evaluations of players who may still have something to contribute, especially when those players have a minor league option remaining and don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be on the team or DFA'd.    The Orioles are never going to be some large-market team that can afford to spend its way out of mistakes. Everything that the Orioles do will have a cost down the road. Even saving money has a cost, as the case of Gonzalez shows.  The cost is not paid in money but in a lack of talent on the team in the short and long term. They are paying that cost now and every time they do something like this they will set themselves up to pay it again.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The Boston Red Sox and the visiting Baltimore Orioles will battle for three games with first place in the American League East on the line beginning on Tuesday at Fenway Park. Both clubs squandered an opportunity to enter the series with the lead when the Orioles fell at Toronto on Sunday and the Red Sox lost in Minnesota. The two clubs got a day off on Monday to contemplate their respective crushing defeats, with Boston going down on a walk-off home run in the 10th inning and the Orioles leaving the tying run at third base in a 10-9 setback to the Blue Jays. The setback was the third straight for Baltimore, which allowed 30 runs in the four-game series at Toronto. The Orioles gave up a total of 29 runs in a four-game series at home against Boston bridging May and June but managed to slug their way to a pair of wins and take a 4-3 lead in the season series. The Red Sox are just 4-4 since leaving that series in Baltimore and are opening a 10-game homestand on Tuesday that includes visits from the Seattle Mariners and the Chicago White Sox. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Chris Tillman (8-1, 3.01 ERA) vs. Red Sox LH David Price (7-3, 4.63) Tillman bounced back from one of his worst starts of the season with one of his best on Wednesday against Kansas City, striking out nine without issuing a walk in 7 1/3 scoreless innings to earn the win. The 28-year-old allowed three home runs in each of his previous two starts but surrendered just one extra-base hit \xe2\x80\x93 a double \xe2\x80\x93 against the Royals. Tillman missed Boston the first two times around this season but is 9-3 with a 2.84 ERA in 18 career starts against the Red Sox. Price is looking much more like the ace Boston paid him to be over the last month with a string of six straight quality starts. The former No. 1 overall draft pick was a tough-luck loser in San Francisco on Wednesday, when he was reached for two runs on three hits \xe2\x80\x93 two solo home runs \xe2\x80\x93 over eight innings in a game the Red Sox went on to lose 2-1. Price was knocked around for five runs in as many innings against Baltimore on April 11 and is 8-4 with a 2.90 ERA in 20 career starts against the Orioles. WALK-OFFS 1. Red Sox 3B Travis Shaw is 1-for-22 over his last six games. 2. Baltimore 1B Chris Davis has homered in five straight games 3.

The Baltimore Orioles took over sole possession of first place in the American League East with a combination of pitching and power, and the Boston Red Sox would like to return the favor. The Red Sox will try to pull back into a tie for first place in the AL East when they host the Orioles in the second of a three-game series on Wednesday. The Orioles offense combined for 13 strikeouts on Tuesday but also slugged a pair of home runs in support of a strong effort from Chris Tillman in a 3-2 triumph. The win snapped a three-game slide and was a departure from the beginning of the road trip in Toronto, where the Baltimore pitching staff let up a combined 30 runs in the four-game series. Boston has dropped seven of its last 11 games to lose control of the East, with three of those setbacks coming against the Orioles. The Red Sox lead the majors in several offensive categories, including runs scored, but have been outscored 52-47 while dropping five of the first eight meetings with Baltimore. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Tyler Wilson (2-5, 4.73 ERA) vs. Red Sox RH Steven Wright (7-4, 2.09) Wilson is enduring a five-start winless streak but got enough offensive support to stay out of the decision at Toronto on Thursday. The Virginia native was knocked around for five runs on seven hits and three walks in 5 2/3 innings in a game the Orioles went on to win 6-5. Wilson matched up with Wright on May 30 and came away with a loss despite holding the Boston offense to three runs on eight hits and a pair of walks in 6 2/3 frames. Wright continues to baffle opposing hitters with his knuckleball and did not allow an earned run in either of his last two starts. The 31-year-old ran his streak to four wins in as many starts by holding the Minnesota Twins to an unearned run on seven hits and two walks while striking out six over 7 1/3 innings on Friday. Wright tossed a complete game at Baltimore on May 30, scattering two runs, four hits and five walks over the nine frames to earn the win. WALK-OFFS 1. The Orioles have homered 32 times in 13 games this month. 2. Six of Red Sox CF Jackie Bradley Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s seven hits this month have gone for extra bases. 3.

There\xe2\x80\x99s some sense to it, sure. Navigating the bullpen to favor the arm-side match-ups provides its benefits. For example, let\xe2\x80\x99s say you start the 9th inning with two right-handed batters, followed by a lefty.  In comes Mychal Givens, a notorious nightmare for right-handers whose sweeping slider and mid-90\'s fastball perfectly slots him as a two-batter specialist. Who follows? For farts and giggles how about Fernando Abad, whose current .100/.125/.133 slash versus lefties is a natural fit to record the crucial 27th out.  Manipulating the odds into your favor using situational splits, even more so as the baseball game reaches its breaking point, is a strategy that should work, and can work. Baseball has created the specialist to succeed in special opportunities, and again, the numbers theorize its merits.     In today\xe2\x80\x99s sphere, the Clint Eastwoods of the world intimidated by kids and their algebras often fall back to traditional baseball acumen using phrases like \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s a baseball player\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9che knows how to get outs\xe2\x80\x9d. We call that the \xe2\x80\x9cHarold Reynolds Doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, there is some truth we can latch onto thanks to the old-schoolers.     Despite an abundance of what tends to be overwhelming raw talent at the position, closing baseball games can\xe2\x80\x99t be fun, man. Storming out of the outfield gates, running to the mound with the force of the crowd, both for and against your cause.  Classic rock, hip-hop, modern pop or whatever it is, the music usually playing in your Beats are instead blared over the loudspeakers, amplifying the moment to come. Three outs. You only need three outs, but as the situation dictates, you\xe2\x80\x99re in control of the finishing frame. Closing takes a certain kind of personality combined with the right dominant stuff, and not everyone has those things like Britton does.    What a relief it is for the likes of us to know that even on nights the Orioles score a bunch and surrender a few less, or squeak out a lead only to lean on the rare quality start, that Britton slumbers in the bullpen. There really isn\xe2\x80\x99t any other way to put it than to say he\xe2\x80\x99s awesome. Super-duper, man-crush Monday, Khaleesi-burnin\xe2\x80\x99-bad-guys kind of awesome.  Comparing a mortal man to the Mother of Dragons should not be taken lightly, but who is to say that Britton is a mortal man? How is that a human being is capable of throwing a 96 MPH fastball that moves like a wiffle ball? And just how good is Britton? You know, 0.96 ERA and perfect 20 saves in 20 chances kind of speaks for itself, as do his 0.61 WHIP and .180 BABIP. His initial 2016 returns, purely from a numbers standpoint, plant the idealistic seed that perhaps, just perhaps, Britton is indeed what some would call the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d closer in baseball.     Can that be perceived as homerism?  Sure, but having the pleasure of watching Britton pitch 27 games so far this year has done more to cement the notion than detract it.  Aroldis Chapman has his fastball, Kenley Jansen has his cutter, and Wade Davis has both and some other stuff. All three are sturdy in how they go about their business, and all three have built a style batters can sense, but still can\xe2\x80\x99t hit. But none before are the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d closer today. Zach Britton is.  Why you ask, why do you say? Why is Britton better than perhaps, Alex Colome? Being nearly unhittable is probably why.

You have to be an ESPN Insider to read the entirety of his rankings, but the headline spoils the ending where he ranks Britton\xe2\x80\x99s sinker as the best pitch in today\xe2\x80\x99s baseball world.  Sarris\xe2\x80\x99 approval speaks volumes, given his profound want-to as a pitching/grip connoisseur, especially as he continues to travel from team to team politely bugging pitchers to show him their grips.     Even still, one pitch against Josh Rutledge in a one-run game may be all the proof anyone will ever need to cement Britton\xe2\x80\x99s sinking fastball as the nastiest pitch in baseball.  How does he do it? It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a pitch like his before. The 96+ MPH consistency is now a regular prerequisite to close games, but adding the kind of movement he creates is where the mystery beholds. And we aren\xe2\x80\x99t talking about just right to left fade or vertical sink, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a combination of both. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen with fastballs, especially one just south of triple digits.  What does that fastball do? Naturally, a diving fastball that moves down and in to lefties or sinking away from righties creates ground balls, and no one in baseball is better at forcing the ball to his infielders than Britton.  His 80.3 GB% leads the league, and as the reverse dictates, Britton\xe2\x80\x99s fly ball rate of 4.9% is tops as well. In a one run-game, is it harder to string together two or three hits or hope a ball in the air find its way over the fence?  Most closers find themselves in the 9th inning because they typically don\xe2\x80\x99t allow baserunners, but human imperfection is occasionally met with a mistake over the plate. A lot of grounders and a .180 BABIP can do a lot to a psyche, however.     One piece of of Britton\xe2\x80\x99s brilliance is his avoidance of fly balls. Opposing hitters have to hope that his sinker doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sink, and even then, the 95.3 MPH average fastball velocity creates room for error. Though most nights, the sinker does sink, \xc2\xaf\\_(\xe3\x83\x84)_/\xc2\xaf. That pitch is where he separates from the rest of the Joe-Flacco-is-elite closers. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to love some like Chapman and his flame-emoji fastball, but a straight 102 MPH fastball is THAT much easier to hit than 96-98 MPH with wicked-hawd tilt. It just so happens the numbers back it up.  In 13 more innings, Britton\xe2\x80\x99s whiff rate of 18.8% (3rd-best in baseball) is slightly ahead Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s 18.1%, while Britton\xe2\x80\x99s 39.7% chase rate outpaces Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s by nearly six percent (34.0%). Though Chapman gets less contact in the strike zone than Britton, Chapman is in the strike zone 16% more often (58.6%) than Britton.  Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s zone percentage leads all closers while Britton\xe2\x80\x99s 40.5% frequency in the zone is 14th-lowest. The numbers help to reassure that Britton excels at creating the illusionary strike, whereas Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s ever-explosive heater stays on the same plane.  Granted, both are phenomenal at what they do, but one dominates by throwing imaginary strikes, rather than having to. Conventional wisdom says you take that guy every time.     Other than Mariano Rivera being a lifetime Yankee, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find any fault with the way he operated for 19 seasons, leaning on one primary pitch. From 2009-13 according to PITCHf/x, Rivera threw his cutter 86.2% of the time to the tune of a 2.56 FIP. In comparison with Britton, who throws his sinker 89.8% so far in 2016, is on a three-year pace to an average 89.7% fastball frequency paired with a 2.33 FIP.  As Rivera proved, hitters can know what\xe2\x80\x99s coming and still swing with timidity, and Britton is doing it as well as anyone in today\xe2\x80\x99s era has ever done it.  For a team like the Orioles, a salvageable start can\xe2\x80\x99t be wasted, making Britton just the right kind of hero. As we saw on Monday night, an evening comprised of Chris Tillman dominance, Britton was tasked with coming into the game to record the last five outs.  Despite Hanley Ramirez sneaking a single up the middle to score an inherited run, Britton struck out four of the last five outs, including all three Red Sox in the 9th inning.  The most impressive of the five outs was the first batter he came in to face, David Ortiz. You can be mad at Ortiz for being whatever, or whoever he is, but the dude can still flat-out hit, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t often guys make him look bad. But most guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t Zach Britton.              <picture class=""c-picture"" data-cid=""site/picture_element-1494653514_5361_14646"" data-cdata=\'{""picture"":true,""dynamic_picture"":false,""convert_picture"":false}\'>            <img srcset=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oATYYigb2BTNRTtewu-BuBB3MiU=/0x0:718x404/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XG2dkYT7jp-KpODnh6SKo5h8NPc=/0x0:718x404/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z06KT5vx4iF8N__bru9MxINkUv0=/0x0:718x404/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XKXmw7oqqNzs95fBXprP34pESaM=/0x0:718x404/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 920w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-EPehyJrGKh6FICSVc37eh5izCg=/0x0:718x404/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 1120w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZAR7GRocboOHGrYRC8JEaGF7yQ=/0x0:718x404/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 1320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mBV7YJxra6RdKZ-M15lXs6TCKEI=/0x0:718x404/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 1520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yn48GTN5uIOuoKkfvkBu3YePyRw=/0x0:718x404/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 1720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1X1pksrC8kZkhJmJ13QzJZnfq1g=/0x0:718x404/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 1920w"" sizes=""(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0TzSffPaWskfwcyrUgAjCr7CQ-U=/0x0:718x404/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif"">  </picture>         There is no person of our same planet that could possibly lay off of that pitch. At 98 MPH, you already have to think \xe2\x80\x9cswing\xe2\x80\x9d if only to immediately decide otherwise, but Britton creates an ultimatum. You either swing or you don\xe2\x80\x99t and even if his fastball isn\xe2\x80\x99t a strike, more often than not, hitter\xe2\x80\x99s brains convince them to do so.

From the beginning nothing has been plain and simple. He signed a major league contract straight out of the draft. Something that was seen as a good deal for everyone at the time. Touted as perhaps the most polished high school starting pitcher of all time, three years would be plenty to get him ready for the major leagues. He came up briefly in 2012 to pitch out of the bullpen as a 19 year old.     Then, as so often happens to pitchers, his elbow started barking at him and he had to get Tommy John surgery. His struggles have been immense since the surgery, never quite feeling the same as before. Fast forward to now, at least somewhat healthy and that major league contract came back to bite everyone.  The Orioles have to carry Bundy now that he is out of options and he is not rehabilitated enough to start. Therefore, we get bullpen Bundy. But, not fully loaded Bundy because his arm hurts when he throws his cutter and/or slider. Considering his cutter has been touted as his best pitch, that\xe2\x80\x99s worrisome.  As it stands, he\xe2\x80\x99s more of a fastball curve ball multi-inning reliever who gets his work in as he tries to reassemble the pitcher he was out of the pitcher he is now. However, he has been looking better of late. He\xe2\x80\x99s had six innings in June and six strike outs. Not a big sample size, but much better than earlier in the year so I wanted to see why.             Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s why. In case you were wondering, that is Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s month by month fastball velocity chart for 2016. As you can see, it goes up. From 94 mph in April to 96 mph in June. That will certainly help and that is the Bundy everyone dreamed about right after his draft.     It\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that he is still recovering and gaining strength. This is not the best situation, but for now at least some progress is being made.  Jonathan Schoop is Pretty Good Jonathan Schoop is a fixture in the everyday lineup. He\xe2\x80\x99s brought his line up to .268/.299/.463 in 2016 and is continuing to blister the baseball and play solid up the middle defense. I wanted to play my favorite arbitrary endpoint game and see where Schoop was over his last 162 games.     Well, his line is .271/.303/.468 good for a 106 wRC+ over that period of time. By the way, his last 162 stretches back to September 15th, 2014 due to his knee injury last season.  Unless Schoop starts to make more contact or starts to walk more, that line is probably his ceiling. Maybe something around a 110 wRC+ at his very best. But, that kind of line with his solid defense gives the Orioles exactly what they need. Someone who can play everyday give value to the roster at a low cost.  The Infield Defense I wrote a while back about how the outfield defense for the Orioles had been atrociously bad. It had been and pointing that out brought out some angst from the commentariat. To be fair, the Orioles won 11-3 the day before while hitting six home runs.     Not many were in the mood to hear about outfield defense. Regardless, the outfield defense has still been bad and ranks 29th overall in baseball with a -10.3 UZR/150 (you can read more about UZR/150 here).  But, I wondered, about the infield defense because the Orioles overall defensive rating was not quite as bad. It\xe2\x80\x99s harder to find because the Fangraphs leader boards do not allow to easily find the split for just the infield. But, using the magical powers of Excel, I can find it easily enough.  By subtracting the total team UZR/150 by the outfield's UZR/150 you basically get the infield UZR/150. This number still includes the pitcher and catcher, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the kind of time to separate all that out. The Orioles infield overall has a 5.8 UZR/150 which is the second best number in baseball behind the Cleveland Indians who have a 7.2 UZR/150 for their infield. It makes sense that the Orioles defensive strength would be the infield, but I was surprised to find just how good it is. I guess when you have Manny Machado and no one else does it helps a lot.

Wright\xe2\x80\x99s line: 3.2 IP, 6 H, 8 R, 1 BB, 3 K. My thought was that Wright was being optioned after the game to begin with. However after seeing him fall apart in the fourth inning and seeing Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s quick hook, that pretty much sealed it.Wright was optioned to triple-A Norfolk after the game, most probably for a more permenant amount of time in this case. Gallardo will take his roster spot when he\xe2\x80\x99s activated from the DL this afternoon. Wright gave up a three-run homer to Saunders, and a solo shot to Donaldson through the first three innings. The O\xe2\x80\x99s kept things interested with RBI-singles from Machado and Trumbo, but that was somewhat of a mirage.By the end of the fourth inning, Toronto had put 11 runs on the board through various home run balls. In the middle of the inning however, Wright was lifted and into the game went Jimenez. And the barrage continued. If anything, it got worse.

Regardless of how much he\xe2\x80\x99s struggled with the Orioles, someone would pick him up before he cleared waivers. It\xe2\x80\x99s all but a given, and it might even be someone in the AL East. Then the O\xe2\x80\x99s would literally be paying Jimenez to pitch for another team \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps even against them. And for the next year-and-a-half at that.That would be a very poor fiduciary move. However at some point does it become a worse move to keep him on the roster? My personal answer to that is still no \xe2\x80\x93 it would be a very poor business decision to DFA Jimenez.

06/20/2016,"[('Orioles waste chances, Gausman wastes run support in 4-3 ...', ' Baseball can really be an annoying game. The Orioles, as good as they can be, are not immune to this. They played one of those annoying games against the Rangers on Monday night in Arlington and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were losers by a 4-3 score.    The game happening at all on this day was annoying enough. It was, after all, a makeup of a postponed game. That postponement occurred even though, by the time it was the scheduled first pitch on April 17, the rain had stopped. So for literally no good reason, the Orioles were forced to disrupt their schedule, losing an off day for a one day trip to Texas. This was surely some kind of contributing factor in why the Orioles looked discombobulated at times. They probably were discombobulated. Not that it\xe2\x80\x99s any excuse, because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take away the loss from the standings, but it is something to cling to and think this won\xe2\x80\x99t happen in more ordinary circumstances. What makes it more annoying than anything is that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to be a bad game. Going up against the worst Rangers starter by ERA, Derek Holland, the Orioles had a prime chance to finally rack up some runs in support of a Kevin Gausman start.    The Orioles were plainly swinging early against Holland and they started to make that work in the second inning. Jonathan Schoop led off the inning with a single and he scored on a J.J. Hardy double, giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s the lead with no outs. Two more runs crossed in the inning, with Adam Jones driving in Hardy on a single and Joey Rickard driving in Jones on a double.    What would Gausman do with actual run support? Hold that thought for a minute. The bad news The very next inning saw the Orioles with a chance to add on even more runs. Mark Trumbo walked to begin the inning, and back-to-back singles by Matt Wieters and Schoop loaded the bases with no one out.     This is as prime of a scoring opportunity as you can get... unless you\xe2\x80\x99re an Orioles team that\xe2\x80\x99s not homering. Hardy struck out on a ball out of the zone and Nolan Reimold grounded into an inning-ending double play. Momentum is not a real concept, but sometimes it feels real, and blowing a bases loaded opportunity is one of those times where that kind of shift feels real. In the half inning after the O\xe2\x80\x99s wrecked their scoring chance, Gausman gave up a deep home run to center field to Ian Desmond - the 11th home run of the year for the Rangers unexpected center fielder. Whatever, it happens sometimes - good hitters get hits.    The problem was the next inning after that. Gausman began the inning by walking Prince Fielder. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing. Don\xe2\x80\x99t walk Fielder in 2016. He\xe2\x80\x99s bad and has no bat speed. Throw strikes. The guy is slugging .310. This was ridiculous. From here, Gausman started to fall apart in Ubaldan fashion, chucking up hittable pitches that the Rangers hitters didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss. They got their own bases loaded chance with one out thanks to Elvis Andrus and Mitch Moreland singling to put ducks all around the pond. No big deal, right? Gausman would just have to make some pitches against Bobby Wilson, the catcher and #9 hitter with a career OPS of .581. Gausman quickly got an 0-2 count on Wilson, but then Wilson started fouling off pitch after pitch, six foul balls in all, before finally lofting a ball to deep center field.  An easy sacrifice fly. The crappy-hitting catcher did what the Orioles could not and put the ball in the air. Oh, and with the slow Fielder running, Jones made the ill-advised decision to try to fire the ball wildly in towards the plate. This allowed the runner to advance from first to second as Fielder scored - the go-ahead run in scoring position. That proved crucial after the next batter, Shin-Soo Choo, pulled a single into right field. Had Moreland stayed on first, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way he would have scored. Instead, he scored easily to put the Rangers ahead, 4-3, which if you were paying attention earlier, you already know was the decisive run in the contest.    There were other wasted opportunities. The Orioles actually out-hit the Rangers in the game, 15-9, but they only batted 3-11 with runners in scoring position - and one of those hits didn\xe2\x80\x99t even score a run. Holland came out of the game in the fifth inning, relieved by Shawn Tolleson, who began the night with an 8.02 ERA in 24 games pitched. The kind of guy you want to do something against - like Reimold leading off the inning with a single. However, for some unknown reason, the Orioles decided to try a hit-and-run or run-and-hit or some other boneheaded play with Paul Janish at the plate. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try plays when Janish is the batter. Janish swung through a bad pitch to feel obligated to swing at and Reimold was thrown out easily at second base. Dumb. Janish later got a hit and did not advance further. For all of that, the Orioles managed to get the tying run to third base with only one out in the ninth inning. Chris Davis hit a single and with an impressive display of hustle, motored to third base when Trumbo followed with a hit behind him. There was some hope, but not for long. Wieters struck out. Schoop chopped a ball to third base for a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice and that was that. The Orioles lost. That\xe2\x80\x99s the bad news. The good news The good news is that the Orioles played a sloppy game full of wasted opportunities against the team with the best record in the American League, under less-than-ideal travel circumstances, while their best player, Manny Machado, was serving the second game of his four game suspension, and the Orioles only lost that game by one run.    That silver lining doesn\xe2\x80\x99t erase any loss from the standings, either, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something. Put in Machado and maybe they win. A couple of players make a couple of better decisions and maybe they win. Hope for next time. More good news is that while the Orioles were playing this game, the Red Sox blew their own gift scoring chance - it was even worse for them. In Boston, the game was tied 1-1 in the 9th and a White Sox reliever walked the bases loaded, but the Red Sox could not walk off and they went on to lose 3-1. So the O\xe2\x80\x99s lose no ground against their closest competition. Oh, and relieving Gausman was Dylan Bundy, who actually kind of looked good out there. Bundy finished off the final three innings of the game, big for saving the bullpen for the rest of the week. He retired all nine Rangers he faced, picking up three strikeouts. That\xe2\x80\x99s something. But the Orioles still lost, Gausman is still winless on the year, and they still have to fly right back to Baltimore and play a game again tomorrow night with no rest. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Padres coming to town for two games.

A pair of first-place teams will square off Monday in a make-up game when the Texas Rangers host the Baltimore Orioles. The Rangers are squeezing in the contest \xe2\x80\x93 which was originally scheduled on April 17 but postponed due to rain \xe2\x80\x93 between a 10-game road trip and a two-game series that begins Tuesday at home against Cincinnati. They capped off the trip with a 5-4 victory at St. Louis, finishing a three-game sweep and setting a new season standard with six straight wins. Opponents have been held to 3.2 runs during the streak, but Texas pitching will be tested against the high-powered Baltimore offense, which cranked out a season-high 19 hits in an 11-6 win over Toronto at home on Sunday. Second baseman Jonathan Schoop homered for the second straight game and has four blasts in his last nine contests for the Orioles. Baltimore left town following the win but will return to Camden Yards on Tuesday to open up a six-game homestand. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (0-4, 4.14 ERA) vs. Rangers LH Derek Holland (5-5, 5.14) Gausman is winless in 11 starts and is coming off his worst outing of the season, a loss at Boston in which he gave up six runs in three innings. That left the 25-year-old at 0-3 with a 4.78 ERA in six road starts this season and 5-15 with a 5.10 mark for his career. Rangers designated hitter Prince Fielder is 4-for-8 with a home run against Gausman, who is 0-1 with a 3.68 ERA in three games (two starts) in his career against Texas. After posting four straight quality starts, Holland has given up 10 runs (nine earned) in 8 2/3 innings over his last two outings, serving up four home runs in the process. The 29-year-old is 5-2 with a sparkling 2.94 ERA in his career against the Orioles but has never faced them with Mark Trumbo \xe2\x80\x93 who is 14-for-45 with five homers against Holland \xe2\x80\x93 in the lineup. The Ohio native has enjoyed success against Baltimore slugger Chris Davis (1-for-11, eight strikeouts) and catcher Matt Wieters (2-for-18, five strikeouts). WALK-OFFS 1. Texas is 16-4 in one-run games \xe2\x80\x94 the best mark in the majors. 2. Orioles 3B Manny Machado will be serving the second of a four-game suspension. 3.

Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsHas Baltimore Orioles catcher Matt Wieters now fully recovered from past injury and fully returned to the top-notch player he was expected to be?Watching him play on Sunday and seeing him go 4-for-5 with a double and homer would certainly indicate that he is in a good place. And clearly his throwing this year has shown that there are no residual issues from the elbow surgery and recovery.Even so, his playing time has remained somewhat constrained and cautiously proportioned. But especially with Caleb Joseph out, it has gradually been expanding and the offensive numbers growing along with it.The hype and hope surrounding Wieters after his first round, number five overall pick in the 2007 draft was extremely high. He broke into the majors in the midst of the 2009 season, and after the five years of \xe2\x80\x9809-\xe2\x80\x9813 was hitting .255 with 87 home runs in 657 games. Not bad, especially for a catcher; but it was not up to hopes for such a high draftee. It was short of \xe2\x80\x9cMauer with power.\xe2\x80\x9dWith the coming of the 2014 season, it finally appeared that a corner had been turned. Wieters was off to a great start, helping the Orioles get off to a great start as well. After 22 games he was batting .337 with an OBP of .372, clubbing five homers as well.And then the injury happened \xe2\x80\xa6 and then the surgery \xe2\x80\xa6 and then the long road to recovery from ligament replacement.He was clearly far from ready to return early in 2015, in the field as well as at the plate. By June 5th he was back with the team, though being played judiciously throughout the season and totaling 75 games with a .267 average along with eight home runs. Through the end of August he hit for a .256 average, but finished the final month of the season hitting .305.From the time he returned to the team in June of last year, he played in 69% of the remaining games through the end of the season. This year he has been in 71% of total games, though in June it is 78%. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryWieters is definitely a player who likes being at home. This year he is hitting .289 at home and .245 on the road. Last year he hit 95 points higher at home. For his career he is batting .268 at Camden Yards and .249 everywhere else. And DH-ing simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, hitting just an even .200 in 48 games.Apart from numbers, Wieters simply looks more like himself this year, or more appropriately he looks more like something beyond himself \xe2\x80\x93 a sort of player we hoped to see arrive.

The Blue Jays pulled themselves to within a game of the leading Orioles on Friday night, though the O\xe2\x80\x99s picked up two important wins to knock the Jays a bit farther down.    Still, three teams within three games as the calendar moves into late June is a tense race. Actually, the AL East race was even more bunched up on Father\xe2\x80\x99s Day last year, with four teams being within three games of the lead on June 21. The team that led, the Rays, finished up the year 13 games off the pace. They were 40-31 on Father\xe2\x80\x99s Day and finished the season below .500. A lot of baseball has been played, and that tells us something about teams, but there is a lot more still to be played. Orioles fans can only hope that the O\xe2\x80\x99s don\xe2\x80\x99t suffer the same fate as last year\xe2\x80\x99s Rays.    Baltimore Orioles  Record: 40-28 Last Week: 4-2 (2-1 at Red Sox, 2-1 vs. Blue Jays) Games Ahead: +1 (gained a game on Red Sox) Upcoming: 1 game at Rangers, 2 games vs. Padres, 4 games vs. Rays  The following exchange took place in a chat held by ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Keith Law on Thursday:     Al: How can the Orioles stay in the race? Is it impossible? Is strong hitting, defense and bullpen work enough? Because they arent going to get quality starting all year\xe2\x80\xa6.does that hurt the bullpen then? Klaw: They haven\xe2\x80\x99t been getting quality starting so far, other than Tillman, and are still basically a .500 team since the 7-0 start. If that means they\xe2\x80\x99re heading for 86-76, are they still fringe contenders?  It\xe2\x80\x99s a running joke on the Internet that \xe2\x80\x9cKeith Law hates (your favorite team).\xe2\x80\x9d Of course he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hate the Orioles or any other team, but his analysis of the successful Orioles teams of the Showalter/Duquette era has never seemed to give them proper credit, and this kind of comment shows that seems to be continuing.    The questioner isn\xe2\x80\x99t wrong to wonder how the O\xe2\x80\x99s can stay in the race. But as frustrating as the O\xe2\x80\x99s starting pitching can be, they have at least three starters with an ERA+ of 100 or better - that is, league average or better. Furthermore, it\xe2\x80\x99s not giving the Orioles much credit for the results they\xe2\x80\x99ve put together this season. Even if one wanted to dismiss their 7-0 start - itself unfairly creating an arbitrary beginning point - the Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cbasically a .500 team\xe2\x80\x9d since that 7-0 start.  They were 37-27 at that time, meaning the Orioles had gone 30-27 - three games above .500 if we take out their first week. They\xe2\x80\x99ve since won two out of three and are now five games above .500 after removing the first week. If they played at that pace all season, they\xe2\x80\x99d win 87-88 games, and we still have to add in the 7-0 they already banked.    That\xe2\x80\x99s a whole lot better than fringe contenders. That\xe2\x80\x99s a definite playoff team. The rotation remains a big question mark, to be sure. They need to find answers better than Mike Wright and Ubaldo Jimenez. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not an accident or a fluke that they\xe2\x80\x99re in first place right now. They have to keep playing well to stay high up in the standings. No one should discount their chances of doing so. And now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said all of this, the Orioles are going to lose their next five games. Sorry.

Boston Red Sox  Record: 39-29 Last Week: 3-3 (1-2 vs. Orioles, 2-1 vs. Mariners) Games Behind: 1 (lost a game) Upcoming: 4 games vs. White Sox, 3 games at Rangers  The Orioles need to take care of business against the Rangers and Padres because while that\xe2\x80\x99s going on the Red Sox will be dismantling the disintegrating White Sox. Perhaps old friend Miguel Gonzalez can do us a solid on Monday night.    The Red Sox spent $72.5 million on outfielder Rusney Castillo in 2014 and they put him on waivers on Saturday. If no one claims Castillo, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be off the 40-man roster but still getting paid while playing for Triple-A Pawtucket. What do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be able to shrug off a $72.5 million mistake? They don\xe2\x80\x99t even care! They can go out there and ask about Jose Fernandez and Gerrit Cole. They already swung a ridiculous trade for Craig Kimbrel and they\xe2\x80\x99ve still got four of the game\xe2\x80\x99s top 40 prospects remaining in their system. The Grease Man Cometh: Boston keeps getting starters demoted to the minors, including Roenis Elias and one-time Orioles prospect Eduardo Rodriguez. The result, as Over The Monster\xe2\x80\x99s Ben Buchanan observes, is that Clay Buchholz is greasing his way back into the rotation. Like Ryan Lavarnway Before Him: The substantial Red Sox prospect hype machine was revved up fully for catcher Christian Vazquez. The problem, OTM\xe2\x80\x99s Matt Collins notes, is that he\xe2\x80\x99s not hitting at all - like a .555 OPS level of not hitting. Can he do better? Toronto Blue Jays  Record: 39-33 Last Week: 4-3 (3-1 vs./at Phillies, 1-2 at Orioles) Games Behind: 3 (lost half a game) Upcoming: 2 games vs. Diamondbacks, 3 games at White Sox  A light week for the Blue Jays, who have played four more games than both the Orioles and Red Sox have done, so this week will start to catch them up some. Plus they get to play two cakewalk teams.    Jose Bautista is on the disabled list - though he\xe2\x80\x99s got an .815 OPS this year, he\xe2\x80\x99s only batting .230. Troy Tulowitzki is off the disabled list for now. Just how much this is a good thing remains to be seen. At this moment, he has a .688 OPS. That\xe2\x80\x99s OK for a shortstop, if maybe not for a $20 million shortstop. Marcus Stroman\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday start notwithstanding, the Jays have the best starting rotation by ERA in the division and it\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly close. R.A. Dickey with a 4.08 ERA makes the #4 starter. If the Orioles had a rotation like that, they\xe2\x80\x99d be up in the stratosphere with the Cubs and their .697 winning percentage. Where There\xe2\x80\x99s Smoak: After a month in which Justin Smoak has batted .224/.305/.376, Bluebird Banter\xe2\x80\x99s Jake Sinclair is ready to move on from Smoak as the everyday first baseman. One of his alternate answers is Jesus Montero - yes, that Jesus Montero. Let The Non-Buyer Beware: Bluebird Banter\xe2\x80\x99s Eric Elliott believes the Jays will not be buyers at the trade deadline for lack of any prospects left to trade. Hey, Eric, that\xe2\x80\x99s never stopped the Orioles from being buyers. Whether or not they should have done is another story. New York Yankees  Record: 34-35 Last Week: 3-3 (0-2 at Rockies, 3-1 at Twins) Games Behind: 6.5 (lost a game) Upcoming: 2 games vs. Rockies, 3 games vs. Twins  The Yankees have still not been above .500 since April 13 despite just concluding a week in which they played six games against two sub-.500 baseball teams, one of which was the very bad Minnesota Twins. They will get another five games against those same two teams this upcoming week.    Much has been made of the so-called three-headed monster in the Yankees bullpen, but outside of those top three names is a bullpen that includes random guys like Nick Goody, Anthony Swarzak, and Richard Bleier. Oh, and also, about that three-headed monster: Presently, two of the three heads have an ERA over 3. Dellin Betances is sitting at 3.24 while Aroldis Chapman is at 3.18. Those will probably come down. Probably. For now, that\xe2\x80\x99s not much of a monster. Stuck In The Middle With You: Yankees fans were happy to get Didi Gregorius and Starlin Castro, but as Pinstripe Alley\xe2\x80\x99s Alec Gilfillan writes, that SS/2B combo has lagged behind others in the division both at the plate and defensively. Life As A Yankee Fan: PSA\xe2\x80\x99s Ben Diamond says that Masahiro Tanaka is criminally underappreciated. What is it like to think something like this? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I think people are well aware that Tanaka is pretty good. Tampa Bay Rays  Record: 31-36 Last Week: 2-4 (2-1 vs. Mariners, 0-3 vs. Giants) Games Behind: 8.5 (lost two games) Upcoming: 3 games at Indians, 4 games at Indians  Weekly Steve Pearce update: Pearce is now batting .329/.401/.553 on the season.    Other former Orioles are not faring as well with this year\xe2\x80\x99s Rays. Ryan Webb is on the disabled list and has been since late May. Just this past week, Dana Eveland was sent to the great DFA in the sky. What do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s like to have Logan Forsythe fall into your lap? The Rays got Forsythe and Matt Andriese (their best starter by ERA this year) in a trade with the Padres in which they surrendered Jesse Hahn and Alex Torres. Who? Exactly. Give credit to Forsythe, though. He had a career .659 OPS through age 26 when he was acquired by the Rays. He had one poor year in a Rays uniform and has since broken out. Last year was good: an .804 OPS. This year, so far, is better, with Forsythe batting .302/.377/.503. ** The Orioles answered some big questions this week by taking series against both of their closest division rivals. But the thing about the baseball season is that there are always more questions, at least until it ends. The competition won\xe2\x80\x99t be letting off the gas. The Orioles can\xe2\x80\x99t do so either. However, there is no getting around the fact that, through more than 40% of the baseball season, every other team in the AL East wishes they could be where the Orioles are right now. They have been good because they are good. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope they keep being a good team.

06/21/2016,"[('The Orioles cannot win the World Series with this pitching ...', ' It happened again last night: the Orioles lost a baseball game in which their starting pitcher was below average, forcing the offense to win the game. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, falling 4-3 to the Rangers in Arlington.     This time it was Kevin Gausman. He went five innings and allowed four runs. If he did that every game, he would have a 7.20 ERA. It is a formula that has worked so far for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Through 69 games, they sit at 40-29 in first place in the American League East. But the pitching rotation cannot continue to be this awful. If it does, the Birds would be hard-pressed to make the playoffs and they would have no shot at winning the World Series. The 2016 season The Orioles have used just seven starting pitchers so far, but the numbers are not pretty. Here are their statistics when they start the ball game:         MLB.com   As a unit, they have an ERA of 4.97, the 27th-ranked number in all of Major League Baseball. The only three teams worse are the Rockies (5.15), Athletics (5.18) and Twins (5.61). That is the company the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers are in. Those three teams are all below .500 and will, in all likelihood, be watching the playoffs from home come October.    This is despite Chris Tillman putting together a really impressive season thus far. He has a chance to be an all-star, but advanced metrics suggest he is due for a slight drop in form (.263 BABIP, 4.05 FIP, 3.91 xFIP, 83.9 LOB%). What will the O\xe2\x80\x99s do if/when that happens?    Pitching wins championships...most of the time The Royals thumbed their noses at the idea that you needed at least one elite starting pitcher to win the World Series. Their rotation was mediocre all season as they finished 2015 with 4.34 ERA, which was the highest mark of any team that made the playoffs last year, but it is still 0.63 runs lower the O\xe2\x80\x99s current number. Here is the full list of 2015 playoff teams and their rotation\xe2\x80\x99s regular season ERA:    Cardinals - 2.99 (1st in MLB) Dodgers - 3.24 (2nd) Cubs - 3.36 (3rd) Mets - 3.44 (4th) Pirates - 3.53 (5th) Astros - 3.71 (8th) Blue Jays - 3.96 (12th) Yankees - 4.25 (19th) Rangers - 4.32 (21st) Royals - 4.34 (22nd) Kansas City also finished their World Series-winning regular season with the lowest-ranked (22nd) pitching staff of any team to take home the crown this century. Here is that full list of the recent World Series champs, their regular season starter\xe2\x80\x99s ERAs and the MLB rank for them:         The only other team during that time period that is even close to the 2016 Orioles awful number is the 2000 Yankees (4.87 ERA), but that was in the midst of the steroid era where everyone was juicing and balls were flying out of the park left and right. During this current time in baseball where pitching is en vogue, they have to do a better job.    Needs improvement These are the situations where the Orioles poor drafting and questionable trade decisions have left them in a tough spot.  In recent years, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have dealt away Jake Arrieta, Zach Davies and Eduardo Rodriguez: three MLB level players. Not that those deals did not make sense at the time (Andrew Miller was vital for the 2014 squad and Arrieta would never have won a Cy Young in Baltimore), but they still happened. They have signed guys like Ubaldo Jimenez and Yovani Gallardo to free agent deals, giving up draft picks in the process.  And they have drafted guys like D.J. Stewart, who, as a college outfielder, was expected to move through the system quickly. Instead, he has a .230 batting average with Delmarva and has just four home runs this season, one year after being selected in the first round out of Florida State. There is no one in the system to jump into the major league rotation and they have few pieces worth dealing that would bring back a significant return without further crippling the already barren cabinet that is their minor league teams.    Outside options Given that it is still so early, few teams will be looking to chalk up the season as a loss and start selling off pieces, but it may happen soon for some rebuilding organizations.  Jeremy Hellickson - an uninspiring choice. The 30-year-old has a 4.41 ERA for the rebuilding Phils. He is a former Rookie of the Year who knows how to pitch in the AL East. Andrew Cashner - 2016 has not been his year. Over 11 starts he has a 4.75 ERA, but the Padres stink and this season may have sunk his value enough for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to snag him. Tyson Ross - He has been hurt all season, meaning the Padres may be reluctant to deal him at the pit of his value, but again, they are bad and could ship him out Rich Hill- the Orioles should have signed him as a free agent anyway, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Now he is killing it with the A\xe2\x80\x99s. But he is 36 and it is a one-year deal so they may not have to give up too much for him. The unattainables - Julio Tehran and Sonny Gray. Two aces on bad teams. Tehran has been pretty good. Gray has struggled. Both could be put up for a king\xe2\x80\x99s ransom. The O\xe2\x80\x99s don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough to get this done unless the big prospects are put onto the table: Harvey, Manicini, Mountcastle. Not happening.  Long story, short. The Orioles are in trouble if they continue on with their current set of starters. Tillman will likely remain solid. Gausman has shown enough moments to encourage you, but outside of that it is anybody\xe2\x80\x99s guess. Who knows what to expect from the likes of Gallardo or Wilson? Jimenez is a lost cause. Worley is likely not a starter, but rather a valuable bullpen piece. And Mike Wright should be a late-inning reliever. This is a talented team who can mash homers and win close games with the lockdown bullpen. But the starting staff is losing too many games for them, and until that changes, the World Series dreams will never be realized.

San Diego is not a good baseball team. They currently sit with a record of 29-42 and are fifth place in the National League West. Their offense has a joint batting average of .241 (23rd in MLB) and they have a team ERA of 4.50 (24th), but they do have some players to keep an eye on. Jon Jay and Wil Myers are two players that would be welcome additions to any team. Jay is slashing .296/.345/.407 with 24 doubles over 68 games. Myers is their likely All-Star rep, slashing .292/.336/.535 with 16 home runs, 16 doubles and 44 RBI. On the pitching side, closer Fernando Rodney is yet to allow an earned run over 25.1 innings and has racked up 14 saves while striking out 27 and walking 10. Southpaw Ryan Buchter has been a nice piece in the \xe2\x80\x98pen as well, striking out 45 in 31 innings and holding batters to a .163 batting average.    They have some other guys you may recognize: Matt Kemp (ya know, the former NL MVP runner-up), Alexei Ramirez, Melvin Upton and Brett Wallace. But, for whatever reason, this group just kind of stinks together.    Tuesday, June 21 at 7:05 p.m., MASN RHP Luis Perdomo (2-2, 8.79 ERA) vs. RHP Tyler Wilson (3-5, 4.16 ERA) Perdomo is a 23-year-old rookie who came up in the Cardinals system. This offseason he was selected by the Rockies in the Rule 5 draft and then purchased by the Padres. He has made only three starts but has 15 appearances out of the bullpen this year. The righty features a mid-90s fastball and has had some BABIP (.419) bad luck so far. But also walks a lot of guys (4.5 per nine innings). Wilson has only ever faced one member of the Padres regular lineup (Ramirez, 0-for-3) so this is pretty much a crap shoot. He was really good against the Red Sox last week, tossing eight scoreless innings. Boston has a ridiculously good lineup, so he will probably really struggle against the mediocre bats of San Diego because, as always, sports defy logic.    Wednesday, June 22 at 7:05 p.m., MASN RHP Erik Johnson (0-4, 7.66 ERA) vs. TBD As the writing of this post, no one is penciled in to start for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. But there are a few options on the major league roster. 1. Ubaldo Jimenez (HAHAHA!) 2. Throw Yovani Gallardo on three days rest; probably not the wisest decision for a guy just getting off the DL. Or 3.  Give Odrisamer Despaigne a go. He did pitch on Sunday, but only for 1.2 innings. He could probably throw 90 pitches on two days rest from that. Man, what tempting options! Johnson made his way to San Diego at the beginning of June as part of the James Shields trade with the White Sox. So far, that deal is not working out for anyone involved. Over three starts in ChiTown, Shields is 0-3 with a (not a typo) 21.81 ERA. Since becoming a Padre, Johnson is 0-2 with an 8.44 ERA.    The Padres 26-year-old righty was a hot prospect with the White Sox a few years ago, rising to be their second most promising pupil, according to Baseball America. His arsenal is that of a soft tosser, though, as his fastball comes in at about 90 mph. This \xe2\x80\x9cseries\xe2\x80\x9d feels like a sweep waiting to happen, but the Orioles starting pitching remains a huge question mark. How many do you think the Birds will pull out?

As of June 9th, he was batting .296 with 20 home runs and 48 RBIs in 59 games. Gotta like that! But in the 11 games since then, he is 8-for-46 (.174) with just a double and three runs batted in.At first glance this might sound terribly over-critical. He had to cool off from a beginning like that, otherwise he would, at that pace, tally 55 home runs and 132 RBIs.However, we are far from the first to point out that a pattern exists from over the first six years of Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s career that June has been a bad month and the overall second half has not been as good as the beginnings of each year.Since he entered the majors in 2010, Trumbo has hit .284 in April and .273 in May. But his combined average over the remaining months is .239, and his worst month is June at .226. Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s power numbers, OBP and everything else drops off at about the same proportion.Does this clear pattern speak to a factor of cumulative fatigue that sets in? Is it a matter of scouting and pitching adjustments being made to which he is not responding?

Statistically, Cruz had a terrible three months of June, July and August of that year. He only hit .213 for those months, though he did contribute 15 homers over the summer.

06/23/2016,"[('Orioles Notebook: Three Existential Orioles Questions ...', ' If you think about the Orioles as much as I do, and chances are if you\xe2\x80\x99re reading this at 11:00am on a Thursday you probably do, from time to time your mind can wander from this season. The day to day grind of a season, especially one in which the Orioles are piling up the wins, dominates the daily thought process of a fan base. Yet, some questions can creep in from time to time about the future of the team.     What will it look like in a year, three years, five years? So, I have three existential Orioles questions. I will attempt to work through some of them and I hope some of you attempt to answer them down in the comments. Is there a Manny Machado extension that you would not want? Come 2019, Manny Machado will be eligible for free agency. With only two and half seasons left of team controlled years for the Orioles, fans have to wonder if the team will be able to keep the superstar around. It could get very expensive.  The extension Manny wants is reportedly in the $400 million dollar range. Being that he\xe2\x80\x99ll still be very young at the time of the extension it could also last for a decade plus. Furthermore, if the current trend of contracts continues, it is likely that Machado would ask for at least one opt out in his deal in order to maximize his potential earnings.     Is there a number that is too high? Too many years? Maybe not enough years? The $500 million number has already been floated for Bryce Harper, is that too much for Manny? Last season I attempted to figure out what an extension might look like. Those numbers have undoubtedly gone up.     I was at a game recently and at least half of my section had a Machado shirt or jersey on. He is clearly a fan favorite if not already THE fan favorite. Peter Angelos just this past off season backed up the brinks truck for a fan favorite\xe2\x80\x94if not a personal favorite\xe2\x80\x94Chris Davis.  While the commitment to Davis is much lower, the talent is much higher with Manny. The knee injuries have to worry you when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about commitments in the hundreds of millions. At this point though, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see a deal that would really scare me off. Manny is great and has a shot to be a hall of famer and it would be awesome if he did all of that as an Oriole.     Who is most likely to be an Oriole after 2018: Adam Jones, Buck Showalter, or Dan Duquette? The contracts of Adam Jones, Buck Showalter, and Dan Duquette all end after the 2018 season. Adam Jones has been an Oriole since 2007. He is a five time all star, the face of the team, and the team leader as currently constituted. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be 33 after his current deal ends.  There will most likely be some baseball left in Adam Jones at that point and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be coming off a year in which he\xe2\x80\x99ll have made $17 million. My guess is that any extension will not come cheap.  Buck Showalter joined the Orioles in 2010 which means by 2018 he would have managed the Orioles for nine seasons which is an eternity in modern baseball. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be 62 years old at the end of the 2018 season. His time with the Orioles has also coincided with their best run in the past decade and a half. He is also a fan favorite and seems to hold some sway with the owner, but that could just be perception.    Dan Duquette has been with the Orioles since 2012 which has exactly corresponded with their rise out of the depths. He\xe2\x80\x99s also been the subject of numerous rumors about looking out for a higher up job in another organization.  The easy way out of this question is that Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s and Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s fates will likely be decided in 2017 or early in 2018 because managers and general managers typically do not work on one year deals. But, if I had to say I\xe2\x80\x99d guess Showalter. Either as the manager or in the front office.  The career of Jones at 33 could definitely be in doubt and if the extension is expensive there are some other players (Manny Machado) that any money Jones might get could go to. Also, Duquette has already shown a possible interest in finding a higher up job in another organization and Brady Anderson is being groomed to assume Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s role.  Do the Orioles ever try to leave Camden Yards?  This question is a little more fun, but every time I go to a game I think about Camden Yards being around for 100+ years. I think a few things are in it\xe2\x80\x99s favor. One, it is modern enough that it can be updated to accommodate the tastes of the time.  Two, it is pretty well located for all types of transit so it is unlikely to become inaccessible. Three, it is beloved and largely still considered to be among the best stadiums in baseball more than 20 years after being built. I think there is a good shot that as long as there is a baseball team in Baltimore they will be playing in Camden Yards which is pretty cool.

The O\'s now lead by two games.    The Orioles helped themselves, too, by capitalizing on an Ubaldo Jimenez quality start in Wednesday\'s game. If you missed it, make sure to\xc2\xa0check out Stacey\'s recap of the game - and don\'t forget to make your voice heard in the Most Birdland Player poll in the recap, either. After a much-deserved off day, the Orioles will tackle the Rays. They get first place all to themselves on this off day. They need it, too, to give the bullpen a rest, to give everyone a rest, really. With four games coming in up in three days this weekend, the fresher they can get before that, the better. Now let\'s roll through an off day edition of the links.

Orioles interested in acquiring lefty starter | MLB.com There will be more to say about this on CC later today - check back later in the morning - but for now, it seems the Orioles are interested in getting a lefty starter, like Pittsburgh\'s Francisco Liriano or San Diego\'s Drew Pomeranz.

He was third in the lineup yesterday. We\'ll see how this continues once Manny Machado is back in the lineup. Where is Manny Machado most valuable to the Baltimore Orioles? (ESPN)Speaking of Machado, should he be at third base or shortstop? This has always been something of an academic question as long as J.J. Hardy is in good health.    Orioles sign 15 Draft picks, for total of 21 | orioles.com Just a bit of routine business. The Orioles signed another 15 draft picks yesterday. The highest of these was fifth rounder Alexis Torres.

In his previous two starts coming into today, he had pitched a combined eight innings. All of those streaks ended today, as he picked up his first win of the season. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7.2 IP, 4 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 7 K.Gausman gave the Orioles exactly the type of outing that they needed this afternoon. When you\xe2\x80\x99re playing in a doubleheader you find yourself in really good shape when and if your starter can give you a long outing in game one. The last thing anyone wants to have to do is go to the bullpen early. The fact that Gausman didn\xe2\x80\x99t put the O\xe2\x80\x99s in a position to have to do that is huge and it bodes well for game two.The Orioles got on the board in the last of the second when\xc2\xa0J.J. Hardy smacked an RBI-single u the middle to give the BIrds a 1-0 lead. Later in the inning\xc2\xa0Adam Jones\xc2\xa0gave the Birds a 2-0 lead with an RBI-single of his own.

Gausman recorded one out in the eighth inning before giving up a base hit, which was when his day ended. On his final pitch, he hit 99 MPH on the gun.It can\xe2\x80\x99t be stressed enough how big a \xe2\x80\x9csolid\xe2\x80\x9d that Gausman did for his bullpen today. Only having to use one reliever when you have an additional game to play today is huge. That keeps the bullpen in effect on normal rest given that almost everyone (Drake being the exception) is still on normal rest.The fact is that teams don\xe2\x80\x99t like doubleheaders because they almost always end up being split.

06/26/2016,"[('The Baltimore Orioles: Comeback Kids Extraordinaire', 'Jun 24, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles third baseman Manny Machado (13) scores on first baseman Chris Davis (19) (not pictured) three single during the sixth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Baltimore Orioles defeated Tampa Bay Rays 6-3. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are on the verge of a four-game sweep of the Tampa Bay Rays after logging two come-from-behind wins in the opening three games.The series got off to an ominous start on Friday night, as the Rays scored three times in the top of the first inning with their starting pitcher dropping the first 13 O\xe2\x80\x99s who came to the plate. But Tampa Bay would not score again over the next 17 innings, as the Orioles came from behind on Friday (6-3), while never trailing in the first game on Saturday (5-0).The second game of the doubleheader last night got off to another ominous start, as the Orioles and ace Chris Tillman fell behind early, 4-0. But the Orioles scored in six consecutive innings from the third through the eighth to prevail in the end, 8-6. Both teams had 14 hits, but the Orioles led in home runs (4-1) and in total team defense.Every starter for the Orioles had at least one base hit, with Matt Wieters getting three, including two massive home runs. Chris Davis and Adam Jones hit long balls as well.Years from now, anyone who looks back at this box score will see the homers by the Orioles and conclude that they were the story of the game. And yes, they were needed. But defense was the bigger story in reality, especially a diving catch by Adam Jones on a bases-loaded, two-out liner in right-centerfield. It that goes through, three runs score and we\xe2\x80\x99re writing a very different recap.Along with the regular fare of fine plays, Manny Machado also made a highlights reel, sliding catch of a pop-up along the wall. It was pretty amazing stuff. The Orioles turned three double plays, though they also hit into three twin-killings.Does it feel to you like the Baltimore Orioles hit into an inordinate number of double plays?\xc2\xa0 I have also felt this way over the years, though I\xe2\x80\x99ve concluded that it is the emotion of a disappointed fan in me that causes that sensation, along with seeing the Orioles play more than all other teams combined.The fact is that the Orioles are not exceptional in this category. Only four other teams (including the Rays) have hit into fewer double plays. And this statistic is a bit deceiving and not the most useful. The Rays have what is arguably the worst offense in the league, yet they have by far hit into the fewest double plays. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t get many people on base, you won\xe2\x80\x99t hit into as many double plays.This is very critical fault-finding, but when the Orioles took a lead of 7-6 in the bottom of the seventh, Showalter got Brad Brach up quickly to throw and come into the game. There simply was not enough time to get him ready, and sure enough he walked his first two batters. With the first of them being a lefty, the better move would have been to let him throw a bit longer while T.J. McFarland faced the leadoff hitter. But all\xe2\x80\x99s well that ends well. With three consecutive outs, the threat had passed and the Rays were doomed to see Britton in the ninth. Having thrown 26 pitches however, Brach is surely not available today, though many arms are fresh and ready to go.If you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see how feature article yesterday on just how good Brach has been this season, be sure to click below and check it out..theiaPostSlider_nav._lower{display:none !important}Related Story: How Good is Brad Brach?This is simply going to be a great summer of baseball fun to watch this Orioles team bomb away with long balls.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles score 12 runs, complete sweep of the Rays - Camden ...', ' The best of teams have a hard time sweeping a four-game series. The worst of teams have a hard time losing 11 games in a row. And yet that is what happened this afternoon as the Orioles demolished the Rays by a 12-5 score. The win gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s the four-game sweep while the Rays are the ones with the 11-game losing streak.    Tyler Wilson didn\xe2\x80\x99t pitch well at all, but as is often the way with this team, the offense more than made up the difference. A four-hit game from Adam Jones and three home runs from the powerful lineup powered the team to their fifth straight win. Dongs are Grand The Orioles mashed three dingers in today\xe2\x80\x99s win, starting with the greatest home run that exists: the grand slam. Rays\xe2\x80\x99 starter Drew Smyly had a very tough first inning, which was evident immediately given that he walked leadoff batter Adam Jones. Singles from Joey Rickard and Manny Machado loaded the bases with no outs for the big fella, Chris Davis. After getting Davis to swing poorly at a few breaking pitches, Smyly for some reason switched up the pitch selection. His 91 mph fastball went down the heart of the plate in the perfect location for Davis to go oppo for the grand slam.    The home run was Davis\xe2\x80\x99s 18th of the season and the seventh grand slam of his career.    As is usually the case, the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop at one home run. In the fourth inning Jonathan Schoop saw one pitch out over the plate and hit a classic Schoop homer. It was pulled and it landed deep into the left field seats. It was a solo shot, the 13th of the year for the O\xe2\x80\x99s second baseman. Not to be left out was man with the most dingers in baseball: Mark Trumbo. Trumbo stepped to the plate with Manny Machado on base and also hit one out to left field. Trumbo is known for hitting long home runs but this one just sneaked over the wall. They all look the same in the box score!    Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s 22nd home run of the year puts him alone in the lead for home runs; he started the day tied at 21 with Nolan Arenda, Adam Duvall, and Todd Frazier. All three dongs were given up by Smyly as the Orioles lit him up for eight runs in just five innings. Reminder: Adam Jones is Awesome Adam Jones has been on a tear lately, including another home run and possible game-saving catch in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s nightcap. He kept it up today with four hits and a walk from the leadoff spot in the order.    The first-inning walk was Adam\xe2\x80\x99s 20th of the season and while he\xe2\x80\x99s still not a guy who walks a lot, keep in mind that his walk totals in 2013-2015 were 25, 19, and 24. So he\xe2\x80\x99s on pace to break that, to say the least. In the second inning, Jones . With Nolan Reimold on third base Jones caught the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 infield off guard with a great bunt down the first base side. Reimold came in to score and Jones beat the throw to first for an infield single. For good measure, and to remind you that he\xe2\x80\x99s not just a small-ball leadoff batter, he also doubled in the game. Adam Jones, y\xe2\x80\x99all. He was slumping early in the season but has more than cleaned his ish up. Tyler Wilson: The Less Said the Better Through the first four innings of this game Tyler Wilson gave up two runs which is neither terrible or great. But he was fortunate to get out of those innings as he did, as he allowed eight batters to reach base. Twice he gave up solo home runs and twice he bailed himself out with double play balls.    To that point Wilson was holding his own, especially given the large lead handed to him by his offense. But it all fell apart in the fifth inning. He actually got two outs with just a runner on first but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t close things out. He gave up doubles to Logan Morrison and Oswaldo Arcia that were sandwiched around a walk to Desmond Jennings, and when he finally got the third out he had given up three more runs and the O\xe2\x80\x99s lead was cut to just one for the time being. Dylan Bundy Does Work It had been awhile since we saw Dylan Bundy, but in his recent appearances he had been looking better and better and has been pitching in longer stretches. He came on to relieve Wilson and pitched three solid innings. The diciest inning was his first, when he hit a batter and allowed a single to Brad Miller. But he followed that up with a 1-2-3 seventh inning and struck out the first two in the eighth before giving up another single. He easily retired Logan Forsythe to end the inning and his day. Bundy is turning into a valuable member of the bullpen, especially with a starting rotation that sometimes only has five innings in them on a given day. Help From an Old Friend With the score 8-5 in the eighth inning, the Rays turned to former Oriole Ryan Webb to get three outs. And well, he did get three outs. But it took him awhile.    The first two outs came quickly as Webb retired Reimold and Francisco Pena and just needed to get Jones out to end the inning. As has previously been discussed at length, Adam Jones is awesome.  He singled to right field (going opposite field with the pitch, what a champ) and that opened the flood gates. Joey Rickard hit a long double to left-center field that Jones scored on, then Rickard scored himself on a single by Machado. Two batters later Machado came in to score on a single by Trumbo, then with Schoop at bat Davis scored on a wild pitch. With that the score was 12-5 and poor Ryan Webb looked totally miserable. Schoop struck out to put him out of his misery, then Odrisamer Despaigne came in for a quick 1-2-3 ninth to secure the win. Sweep! The Orioles easily completed the four-game sweep against the Rays and went 5-1 on the homestand. They continue to hold their multi-game lead in the division and are now 15 games over .500.

In a quick succession of swings \xe2\x80\x94 first by Brian Dozier, then by Trevor Plouffe \xe2\x80\x94 Eovaldi\xe2\x80\x99s outing had imploded. With back-to-back home runs in the sixth inning, the woebegone Twins had broken open a previously one-run game.It had turned into another lost opportunity for the Yankees. Facing the team with the worst record in baseball, the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 starting pitcher faltered once again, and an expensive lineup returned little for the club\xe2\x80\x99s investment. When Max Kepler bashed another home run off Eovaldi two pitches later, the misery only continued.The game was emblematic of the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 deepest issues. Thirteen days before, when they landed in Colorado, they eyed the coming 11-game stretch as a possible boon for their season. With four games against the sub-.500 Rockies and seven against the Twins, it was an opportunity to lard up for a postseason chase they still believe is possible. Instead, with Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 7-1 loss to the Twins, they went just 6-5 in that stretch and lost ground in the American League East.And in failing to pad their record against the dregs of baseball, the Yankees were shown again that they might not be that good themselves. They sat at 37-37 after failing to sweep the Twins \xe2\x80\x94 seven and a half games behind the first-place Baltimore Orioles \xe2\x80\x94 and will host the league-best Texas Rangers for four games this week.

The Yankees did not notch their first hit until the bottom of that inning, when Aaron Hicks hit a double. By then, they already trailed, 5-0. Tyler Duffey, the Twins\xe2\x80\x99 unremarkable right-hander, belied the 6.18 seasonal E.R.A. he took to the mound with eight dominant innings. The only run he allowed was from an eighth-inning homer by Mark Teixeira. The Yankees, meanwhile, allowed more home runs (six) than they had hits (two).

In five starts in June, he has allowed 10 home runs \xe2\x80\x94 tied for the most of any pitcher in baseball this month \xe2\x80\x94 and has already given up more than in any previous season. The Twins scored five earned runs off him in six innings.The Twins\xe2\x80\x99 Danny Santana belted a home run in the third to open the scoring, but that seemed like an outlier until Dozier smacked his two-run shot with two outs in the sixth. Eovaldi said that his problems had stemmed from his falling behind in the count, but of the four home runs he allowed, he had been ahead in the count in half of those at-bats.

06/28/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Looking Back at the Tampa Bay Series', 'Jun 25, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Chris Davis (19) celebrates with teammates after scoring in the seventh inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Baltimore Orioles defeated Tampa Bay Rays 5-0. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAfter the Baltimore Orioles swept the Rays this past weekend, is there really substantive reason for encouragement about this team and this season?Even with a four-game sweep, five straight wins, and a four-game AL East lead, there is no one who can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory quite like O\xe2\x80\x99s fans. But really, how great is it to have beaten a team that came into the series with a seven-game losing streak already in the works?There is no doubt about it, the Tampa Bay Rays are not a very good baseball as currently constructed. To be honest, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think they were that great before all of the injuries occurred, but that\xe2\x80\x99s another topic for another day. (However, if you have not seen last night\xe2\x80\x99s scores, they clobbered the Red Sox 13-7 on 18 base hits.)Yet this is a major league team. At their worst, MLB teams still win a lot of games. Over the past three years (going back), the worst of all teams were the Phillies with 63 wins, the Diamondbacks with 64 and the Astros with 51. So it is still a big deal to sweep a series of four games.Here are some raw numbers from the Tampa By series: the Birds outscored the Rays 31-14. Baltimore had 50 hits in 139 at-bats for a .360 average, along with nine home runs. There was one great start, one okay start, and two poor outings; but the bullpen was great as always \xe2\x80\xa6 well, most always. The relievers threw 13 scoreless innings, giving up eight hits and six walks.So we now have the Orioles team we pretty much expected to see. They out-bomb everyone, hitting 120 home runs \xe2\x80\x93 eight more than Seattle and 12 more than Toronto. Their batting average is third-best in the American League, with a second-best OBP. The bullpen is among the best, though we all know the starting rotation is hit and miss as expected.I\xe2\x80\x99m not a huge believer in WAR and Wins Above Average statistics, but they do illustrate the truth above. The Orioles have a team Wins Above Average (WAA) of 6.6 which ranks them third in the A.L. behind Cleveland and Boston. The bullpen WAA is 3.5, a full point ahead of the next best team (Indians). And the offense for the O\xe2\x80\x99s is 3.3 and good for second-best. But the starting pitching is -0.2 and ranked eighth in the league (which is actually not as bad as you might expect to see).So what does this hold for the future? There is a lot to like in what has happened. And while the starting pitching is a concern, so also is the need to win on the road. The Orioles have now played more than half of their 2016 home games, sporting a great record of 31-13. But they are 14-17 on the road, the place they go now for nine games on the west coast.

Next is the .500 Mariners, who are not playing well right now. After four in Seattle it is back south to SoCal for three against the relatively good Dodgers. Five wins on this trip would be acceptable, six or seven even better. All we need to get off to a good road trip is to have Ubaldo deliver a strong start tonight. That\xe2\x80\x99s all.

Several Orioles will potentially be back in San Diego in a couple of weeks when the mid-summer classic is held there. One Oriole I specifically hope to see there is Adam Jones, who not only deserves to go, but also because San Diego is his hometown.Every year however we go through the charade of who should and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be on each roster, along with arguing over the voting process itself. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before, however here\xe2\x80\x99s my take: fans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be voting. I recognize that even with home field advantage in the World Series on the line, this game is still mainly an exhibition for the fans. So the adverse argument of course is why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the fans decide who plays?And my response to that is because it\xe2\x80\x99s a popularity contest. First off, some teams have bigger fan bases than others. So if all of their fans vote the allotted number of times, it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious who\xe2\x80\x99s players will be on the roster \xe2\x80\x93 whether they deserve it or not. At one point last year there were eight Kansas City Royals that were in line to start in the all-star game. Kansas City is a great team and many of those players had an argument for being in the game. But not eight of them.

And this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a conviction of Kansas City fans, because there is some legitimacy to the point that if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get out and vote don\xe2\x80\x99t blame the people who do. But that\xe2\x80\x99s all why I think the process should be taken out of the hands of the \xe2\x80\x9cunwashed masses.\xe2\x80\x9dIf the managers all voted for the all-star game, at the very least you\xe2\x80\x99d have baseball people making the choice. A true professional isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to choose player A over player B simply because he plays for his team. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to vote for a player at each position who truly deserves to be there \xe2\x80\x93 because that\xe2\x80\x99s what professionals do.

So that would mean that National League managers would get to vote on the American League roster, and vice-versa. Home field advantage or not, this is still an exhibition.

The Baltimore Orioles are one home run away from matching the most hit during the month of June in major-league history and look to tie or break the record on Wednesday, when they complete their two-game series against the host San Diego Padres. Baltimore belted three shots in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s 11-7 victory to raise its total for the month to 54, just one shy of the mark set by the 1996 Oakland Athletics. Hyun Soo Kim hit a two-run shot while Chris Davis and Adam Jones launched solo blasts in the series opener as the Orioles increased their major league-best homer total to 123. Kim recorded three RBIs while Davis, Manny Machado and Jonathan Schoop each notched three hits and two RBIs as Baltimore racked up 17 hits while registering its sixth consecutive win. San Diego learned Tuesday that it will be without starting center fielder Jon Jay (.296 with 24 doubles, the latter tied for the National League lead) from four to six weeks due to a broken forearm. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s tough to replace, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that,\xe2\x80\x9d Padres manager Andy Green told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous leader, he goes about his business the right way. He was great at the top of the order.\xe2\x80\x9d PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Yovani Gallardo (2-1, 6.04 ERA) vs. Padres LH Christian Friedrich (4-2, 3.60) Gallardo is 1-0 with a 4.35 ERA in two starts since returning from a nearly two-month stint on the disabled list. He has put the shoulder issues behind him and is hoping to again resemble the durable hurler who started 30 or more games in each of the past seven seasons. Gallardo is 4-4 with a 4.08 ERA in 12 career starts against the Padres and has struggled versus Brett Wallace (9-for-21, one homer) and Matt Kemp (9-for-25, two homers). Friedrich has experienced back-to-back shaky outings even though he defeated Cincinnati in his last turn. The 28-year-old has allowed 10 runs on 15 hits and six walks in 11 innings during the stretch after giving up eight earned runs over his first six outings. Friedrich has struggled at Petco Park this season, going 2-1 with a 5.57 ERA in four starts. WALK-OFFS  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), ('Relentless Orioles hammering home runs at a record pace', 'Chris Davis and Mark Trumbo have combined for 41 home runs through 75 games for the Orioles.(Photo: Tommy Gilligan, USA TODAY Sports)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORESAN DIEGO \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0Two weeks ago at\xc2\xa0Fenway Park, in a game between the best teams in the American League East, a remarkable event occurred.A Baltimore Oriole stole a base.His name was Joey Rickard. It came in the sixth inning of a 5-1 victory over the Red Sox. No Oriole has stolen a base since, and why would they, when they have a lineup that has spent the first half of the 2016 season impersonating a latter-day Murderers\xe2\x80\x99 Row?Having played their own game of Home Run Derby almost nightly in 76 games, the first-place Orioles brought their long-ball show to Petco Park for two games this week in advance of the real Derby, and the All-Star Game. Adam Jones, native San Diegan, promptly hit the second pitch of the series over the right center field fence. Before the night was done, Hyun Soo Kim, the O\xe2\x80\x99s No. 8 hitter, ripped a line drive over the wall in right, and Chris Davis, reigning AL home-run champ, mashed a long homer to center, running the club\xe2\x80\x99s big-league leading total to 124, and pushing the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 June total to 54 \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0one short of the A\xe2\x80\x99s record for the month.They tied the record hours later, when Mark Trumbo hit a two-run home run Wednesday afternoon, kick-starting their 12-6 victory to sweep the series. They are on pace to belt 262 homers for the year, just two short of the Mariners\xe2\x80\x99 major-league record, set in 1997.""This is easily the most powerful lineup I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been a part of,"" Trumbo told USA TODAY Sports.The 6-foot-4, 225-pound Trumbo, acquired from the Mariners for backup catcher Steve Clevenger, leads the majors with 23 homers. Right behind him are Davis (19) and Manny Machado (18), followed by Jones (16) and Jonathan Schoop (13).     .oembed-asset-photo-image { width: 100%; } Homers are up by 15% around the majors; the Orioles can\xe2\x80\x99t take all the credit, just a healthy share of it. If their long-balling rates hold, all but Davis are heading for career-high totals. Collectively, the Orioles are scoring virtually half of their runs via the homer, a percentage exceeded only by the Mets (52%).""We\xe2\x80\x99re not sitting there playing base to base,""\xc2\xa0Jones said. ""We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to drive the ball and hit the ball out of the park and play great defense. That\xe2\x80\x99s our M.O.""And don\xe2\x80\x99t think Orioles ace Chris Tillman (10-1) doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate it. His teammates have averaged 6.4 runs in his five June starts and well over five runs per game over his two-month, nine-game winning streak.""I\xe2\x80\x99m glad they\xe2\x80\x99re on my side,""\xc2\xa0Tillman said. ""There\xe2\x80\x99s no break in this lineup. It\xe2\x80\x99s fun to come to the ballpark every day and watch them go to work.""It was just last October that the Royals rode lockdown relief pitching, aggressiveness on the bases and a put-the-ball-in-play offensive mantra to a World Series title.The lumbering, lumber-wielding Orioles \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0yes, they are last in the majors with 12 stolen bases \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more different.""It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do a whole lot of good for our guys just to go up there and simply try to make contact,""\xc2\xa0Trumbo said. ""We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do some damage.""Orioles manager Buck Showalter cautions against seeking a larger truth\xc2\xa0or meaningful trend\xc2\xa0here, though.""We\xe2\x80\x99re going to play according to the skills of our players,""\xc2\xa0Showalter said. ""If I had some of the skills that (Royals manager) Ned (Yost) and them have in Kansas City, I\xe2\x80\x99d do the same thing. There are different ways to do it. There\xe2\x80\x99s not some (magic formula).""For his part, the architect of the Orioles, GM Dan Duquette, thinks the club\xe2\x80\x99s offensive success \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 400 runs is second only to the Red Sox in the AL \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0goes beyond the homers. It was Duquette who made the deal for Trumbo, who has recharged his career and brought right-handed power the same way Nelson Cruz did with his 40-home run season two years ago, and who stunned more than a few baseball people by re-signing free-agent Davis to\xc2\xa0a seven-year, $161-million deal.In March, he gave a one-year deal to\xc2\xa0Pedro Alvarez, a defensive liability, but also a slugger who\xe2\x80\x99s averaged 29 home runs per 162 games.""We knew we had power, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve improved our approach, too,""\xc2\xa0Duquette said. ""That\xe2\x80\x99s a good reflection on team management and the work of Buck and (hitting coach) Scott Coolbaugh.""A year ago, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 team on-base percentage was .307, just .02 from the bottom of the league. This year their on-base percentage is .334, a number that again trails only the Red Sox. It\xe2\x80\x99s a striking upgrade, and no accident. Getting more guys on base has been a point of emphasis from the start of spring training. Kim has a team-leading OBP of .431, one of the reasons Duquette signed him out of Korea. Machado\xe2\x80\x99s .390 OBP is a career high by a wide margin.\xc2\xa0(Photo: Tommy Gilligan, USA TODAY Sports)""We\xe2\x80\x99re just battling a little more,""\xc2\xa0Jones said. ""From this lineup this year I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen more 0-2s turn into 2-2s and 3-2s than I ever have. As opposed to 0-2, 1-2 and then a strikeout, we\xe2\x80\x99re putting the ball in play, fouling balls off. Battling. Passing the baton. Making every one of the 27 outs hard. That\xe2\x80\x99s just a testament to our makeup.""Lest you think the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 home runs are a byproduct of playing half their games in cozy Camden Yards, think again. They actually are averaging more homers per game on the road (1.72) than at home (1.32). They are, however, a much harder team to beat in Baltimore (31-13 vs. 16-17). With eight more games on this trip, including four against the Seattle Mariners and three against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the O\xe2\x80\x99s hope to do something about that before returning home to play the Angels and commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1966 World Series championship team.By then, they figure to have pounded another dozen or more long balls. Maybe they will even steal a base along the way \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0not that the big leagues\xe2\x80\x99 leading slugger is terribly worked up about that.""The ultimate goal is us getting into the playoffs and doing a lot of damage,""\xc2\xa0said Trumbo, on pace for a career-high 48 home runs. ""That\xe2\x80\x99s far bigger than anything I\xe2\x80\x99m doing personally. It\xe2\x80\x99s about us continuing on the pace we\xe2\x80\x99re going and making something happen.""GALLERY: Walk-off winsFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInCelebrate good times: Baseball\'s walk-off wins\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Hardy of a two-run shot in the second. Upton then doubled off Mark Trumbo at first.Baltimore had plenty of hits that stayed in the yard, finishing with 17 total. Each regular had at least one. Davis, Manny Machado and Jonathan Schoop each had three.""Since spring training, the lineup from one to nine, anybody can do damage, everybody contributes,"" Schoop said. ""One day, somebody\'s going to step up. It\'s fun. We play the game hard, we play the game right.""Davis passed Hall of Famer Frank Robinson for sole possession of ninth place on the Orioles\' career home run list with 180. He and Machado had three hits apiece.Kim drove in three runs, adding an RBI double in the seven-run sixth. Davis homered and doubled in the inning, Schoop had a two-run double and Machado hit a two-run single.Jones, who went to San Diego\'s Morse High, hit an opposite-field homer to right, his 16th, on the second pitch from Erik Johnson. Kim also went to right field on his two-run homer in the fifth, his second. Davis drove reliever Carlos Villanueva\'s first pitch an estimated 417 feet to center leading off the sixth, his 19th.Ubaldo Jimenez (5-7) beat the Padres in consecutive starts, holding them to one run and three hits in five innings, with five strikeouts and four walks. He won 7-2 against the Padres in Baltimore last Wednesday.""He made a lot of good pitches,"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""I thought he a had crisp fastball, had command of it. I liked the fact he got right back up there and got some outs after the leadoff home run. We\'ll take it.""Upton had a big game for the Padres. He homered an estimated 444 feet off the batter\'s eye in straightaway center field leading off the bottom of the first and had two defensive gems. The first was robbing Hardy of the home run, and the second was a sliding catch of Kim\'s sinking liner in the third.Upton said his homer-robbing catch was ""No. 1 for sure"" on his list of big catches.

06/30/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles and Home Run Records', 'The Baltimore Orioles could break the record on Thursday night for the most home runs in the month of June, a record they currently are tied for.To say the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense has been powerful this month is an understatement.The team has hit 55 home runs this month, tied with the 1996 Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s for the most in the month of June.All of that got me thinking as to whether this team has a chance at some other home run records.We all probably know the major league record for home runs in a season is 264, set by the 1997 Seattle Mariners. Right now the Orioles are on pace to hit 259 home runs in the season.That would leave the team just shy of the record. But, it is worth mentioning that with the warmer weather, the ball will carry more, and more home runs should theoretically be hit later in the season than in the early months.However, one also has to consider if the O\xe2\x80\x99s can keep this current pace up.\xc2\xa0 Regardless, it will be close.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are on pace for 137 home runs on the road. The AL record is 136, set by the 1996 Orioles team. The major league record is 138, set by the 2001 San Francisco Giants.\xc2\xa0 Both of those numbers are certainly within reach.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are on pace for 125 home runs at home, which would put them 13 home runs behind the AL record at home, set by the 2012 New York Yankees. That one might be a stretch.The record for most 20 home run hitters on a team in a season is seven, set by several teams including the 1996 O\xe2\x80\x99s. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the team can quite reach that.Mark Trumbo is currently at an MLB leading (tied with Todd Frazier, who went deep Thursday) 23 HRs. Chris Davis has 19, Manny Machado has 18, Adam Jones has 16, Jonathan Schoop has 13, Pedro Alvarez has 9, and Matt Wieters also has 9. With Alvarez as a part-time player, it will be tough, but not impossible.The record for most 30 home run players in a season is four.\xc2\xa0 This is certainly in reach, as Trumbo, Davis, Machado, Jones and Schoop could all get to 30 easily.The record for most 40 home run hitters in a season is two, by numerous teams. Could the O\xe2\x80\x99s break that record? \xc2\xa0Could Trumbo, Davis, Machado and or Jones get to 40? We all know that Davis has already hit 40 in his career.Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s highest is 34, but he is on-pace to destroy that mark this season. Manny\xe2\x80\x99s highest is 35, last season. He is already half way to that total.Thursday night, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will take their last swings at another record, one that franchise already holds. That is the record for 58 home runs in a month.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Hitting baseballs for Kim as easy as Hyun, two, three ...', ' So, two nights ago, when the Orioles prequeled their 12-6 win with a 11-7 win that concluded deep into the night, you could really tell Padres\xe2\x80\x99 starting pitcher Erik Johnson wasn\xe2\x80\x99t having much fun.     His body language was sour, his face was pouty, but I guess inning after inning of missed spots and whiplash can do that to just about anybody. Well, in the top of the 5th inning, after J.J. Hardy singled, Hyun Soo Kim stumbled to the plate.  Kim had an interesting plate appearance in the top of the 3rd inning, where he lined a 106 MPH line drive to center field, only to be robbed by Melvin Upton Jr., who decided to have the best three innings of his life that night.  So, Kim goes through his pre-swing routine, steps into the box, sees a first-pitch fastball and WHAMMY! He belted his second-career big league dinger over the right field fence, a 108 MPH laser that Upton Jr. deemed unworthy of his Mr. Fantastic powers. Johnson, who did more stargazing than pitching, aimed his two-seamer JUUUUUUST a bit narrow.             Immediately following the home run, my dad texts me, saying only:    \xe2\x80\x9cKim Kim Kim\xe2\x80\x9d Responded by:  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my guy!\xe2\x80\x9d And it\xe2\x80\x99s true. He is my guy.  Orioles fans have been lucky in 2016. To name a few, the expedient plate maturity of Jonathan Schoop, Mark Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s bombastic transition to Baltimore, and Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s blossoming into truly one of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s top three or four players have encapsulated the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 current 47-30 start. The O\xe2\x80\x99s debunking Jay Jaffe and the entire CBS Sports staff is a labeled mountain the Orioles understand, but time and again are fit to climb.  Heaping deserved praise on the trio is well-earned, but to understate the impact of Hyun Soo Kim is to undermine just his frustratingly unique transition to Major League Baseball. Forget the infamous 0-23 spring start, polite declination to Triple-A and sparse early playing time. Despite the initial obstacles, Kim has actually made hitting big league pitching look, well, look easy.             Sometimes the term \xe2\x80\x9cspray chart\xe2\x80\x9d can be misplaced, because you kind of expect a \xe2\x80\x9cspray\xe2\x80\x9d to represent more of a mess, but in Kim\xe2\x80\x99s case, messy is good. Perhaps the single most impressive aspect of Kim\xe2\x80\x99s game thus far has been his acceptance of left field.  Pitchers have made a concerted effort to pitch Kim away with the hard stuff, and he\xe2\x80\x99s had no issue going the opposite way. You\xe2\x80\x99ll often hear hitters, TV guys and others say a hitter is really \xe2\x80\x9cseeing\xe2\x80\x9d the baseball well when they succeed the other way, and the fundamentals behind it are easily understood.  In summation, by letting the baseball travel deeper into the zone, the bat head doesn\xe2\x80\x99t drift . Someone like Pedro Alvarez has a habit of lunging over the plate to reach the outside pitch, and as soon as his top-half collapses bending over to hit the outside pitch, he forfeits his power.     Kim is one of the best in baseball at remaining tall in his stance, trusting his quick hands to cover the outer-half of the plate, all encompassed by his extreme hand-eye coordination. If pitchers want to pitch Kim away, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue going away.  Some may look at his .390 BABIP, the seventh-highest figure in baseball among hitters with at least 130 plate appearances, as much to do with his salacious start, but BABIP can mean a lot of things. Yes, there have been a lot of squeaky ground balls that have found holes, some of which can be attributed to luck.  Kim does boast a very respectable 91.6 average exit velocity however, a figure higher than the likes of Mookie Betts, Chris Davis and Kris Bryant. Fangraphs\xe2\x80\x99 Jeff Sullivan wrote about Kim\xe2\x80\x99s deceptive ground balls, hits categorized as ground balls but more or less should be considered line drives. His extreme BABIP probably has more to do with his innate ability to hit the baseball harder than most. That isn\xe2\x80\x99t luck.  The swing-and-miss nuances that come with slugging prowess help to define the Orioles, but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t Kim\xe2\x80\x99s game. He\xe2\x80\x99s one of only seven players with a BB/K% of at least 1.00, and among his colleagues, sits only behind Chris Davis (13.7 BB%) in terms of walk percentage (11.7%). The Orioles were looking for furthered on-base capabilities, and Kim has brought it.  What leads to more walks and solid contact? A tremendous batting eye. According to PITCHf/x, Kim\xe2\x80\x99s 25.9% chase rate is well below the 30.2% league average, while his overall swing percentage of 39.4% also outlays the base average of 46.3%.     Yet somehow, Kim boasts an above-average zone-contact rate of 90.1%, as well as an extremely high O-Contact rate of 79.2%. Evidently, Kim uses his swings efficiently, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s a meatball over the plate or fouling off pitches to stay alive, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t one to swing just for the sake of swinging. He\xe2\x80\x99s calculated in his efforts.  Kim showed all of his plus traits in the at-bat following his second home run, this time against veteran reliever Carlos Villanueva. As good as Kim has been, this was arguably his best at-bat thus far as an Oriole.  Villanueva started Kim with a hittable curveball, though he fouled it off down the first base line. Kim then took a deceptive changeup for a ball, fouled off a hanging curveball, laid off a diving changeup in the dirt, followed by fighting off another changeup fading down and away.  On pitch six, he finally saw a fastball, sending it straight back to the netting, only to be trailed with a slider down and in, also fouled back. On pitch number eight, however, Kim laced a pretty good slider middle-away down the left field line for an RBI double.           <picture class=""c-picture"" data-cid=""site/picture_element-1494653615_5978_6922"" data-cdata=\'{""picture"":true,""dynamic_picture"":false,""convert_picture"":false}\'>            <img srcset=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iGRNnCUnGv7PX8pV3bHrR7wt7l8=/0x0:720x404/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C6tFM7iYjxXpbS0nDTwAKAptpaU=/0x0:720x404/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v-RgbIFVCMtbYjV0cu6jw-zVOq4=/0x0:720x404/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7KxDzaI3jZGNCcsq2B0PwmsVE6U=/0x0:720x404/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 920w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ls1aVp2VY0zCLFeswPXyQa6zS0c=/0x0:720x404/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 1120w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xfjYgH-Hh60m8UD4zf_s0FvG87A=/0x0:720x404/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 1320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HR-tGSXNJOnj_q4ViVzVC1WZmOk=/0x0:720x404/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 1520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ioKSFk8gsH1adeFBCnso1KSD5zw=/0x0:720x404/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 1720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KoClE7zGd7WzeJUzRQZVlhCwuEg=/0x0:720x404/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 1920w"" sizes=""(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yaSH_oZtt8Hg3UNfAm2E7i4Cat0=/0x0:720x404/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif"">  </picture>         Taking tough pitches, staving off strike three, letting the baseball wander into the depths of the strike zone and using the whole field, all gift-wrapped into one eight-pitch double.

Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles just don\xe2\x80\x99t quit, and that has allowed them to be in games that otherwise, they might have already lost.Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at Thursday night\xe2\x80\x99s game, as an example.I woke up with my soon-to-be two-month-old son at 1215 a.m. to feed him, to see the O\xe2\x80\x99s were losing 4-0 to the Seattle Mariners.My first thought, to be honest, was that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good news for Chris Tillman and my fantasy team.After that, I wondered whether the team would be able to mount yet another late-inning comeback.The Orioles have 24 comeback wins in 2016, easily the most in Major League Baseball. In fact, in more than half of their wins, they came from behind.The team also has scored more runs in the 7th inning (65) than any other inning.All of this means the O\xe2\x80\x99s are a team that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shy away from pressure. \xc2\xa0When the O\xe2\x80\x99s are down, don\xe2\x80\x99t count them out.Which is why I tuned in Thursday night, especially after seeing Hyun Soo Kim hit a solo home run off Taijuan Walker while I was preparing my son\xe2\x80\x99s bottle.Then the 8th inning came along, with the Orioles again down four after a strange error call on a double by Nelson Cruz put him at third base, and a double play was overturned because Jonathan Schoop wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the bag.Schoop walked, but was still on first base with two outs. \xc2\xa0Then Adam Jones singled, Kim singled in Schoop, and Manny singled in Adam.Even as Chris Davis struck out with men on first and second, I still felt like the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a run left in them in the ninth inning.

Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s stuff was plenty good enough, he simply could not put the ball where he desired. He never found the curve ball, walking two batters in the first inning before giving up the initial run on 30 pitches. Tillman was over 100 pitches in the fifth inning and was out of the game after giving up four runs.My primary memory of attending games at Oriole Park pitched by Tillman is that they have been endless affairs due to the first innings taking one-half of forever to complete. He often has a problem settling into the game in the opening frame.Over his career, Tillman has a 5.08 ERA in first innings. The next inning isn\xe2\x80\x99t much better at 4.83.

Smith attempted to advance Martin with a bunt but popped it foul. On the next pitch, he roped his seventh home run into the right-field seats.Dae-Ho Lee had two RBI for the Mariners.The Orioles rallied for two runs in the eighth as Kim and Manny Machado each had RBI singles. But closer Steve Cishek struck out Chris Davis with two on to end the eighth. He then took care of the O\'s in the ninth for his 19th save in 23 opportunities.SECOND CHANCEThe Mariners former first-round draft choice (in 2012) catcher Mike Zunino was called up from Triple-A Tacoma after backup catcher Steve Clevenger broke his hand Wednesday. Zunino struggled in his starting role last season and the Mariners hope time in the minors helped.""From the reports I got, it has been better. He\'s a more productive hitter and he\'s controlling the strike zone better,"" manager Scott Servais said. ""He\'ll have plenty of opportunities to contribute.""Zunino was hitting .282 with 15 home runs and 51 RBI for Tacoma.     .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; }     p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYRelentless Orioles hammering home runs at a record paceNO SECOND LEFTYWith the Orioles placing left-hand reliever T.J. McFarland on the 15-day DL Thursday, that leaves only one lefty on the roster, closer Zach Britton.""We haven\'t had a left-hander step forward and seize that (second lefty role), like we hoped,"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""We have some guys who could potentially do that, but not a whole lot of experience. It\'s something everyone is constantly looking for.""TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: McFarland was placed on the DL because of a nagging left knee injury. He will fly to Baltimore on Friday to have it examined by team orthopedic surgeon Dr. Michael Jacobs then head to Sarasota, Florida, for rehab.Mariners: The Mariners intend to insert RHP Felix Hernandez (strained calf) into the rotation after the All-Star break. The lead-up plan is to have him throw a bullpen session Friday followed by a simulated game then two starts in the minors. ... Clevenger, who broke a bone in his right hand after being hit by a batted ball Wednesday, will have surgery Friday. He is expected back before season\'s end.UP NEXTOrioles: It took 13 starts but RHP Kevin Gausman (1-5, 3.93) won his first game in his previous start Saturday against Tampa Bay, a 5-0 decision. He gave up four hits, struck out seven and walked no one in 7 2/3 innings. He is 0-1 with a 2.63 ERA in two career starts against Seattle, which he\'ll face Friday.Mariners: LH Wade LeBlanc (0-0, 0.00), acquired in a trade with Toronto June 21, allowed no runs and just three hits in his Mariners debut last Friday against St. Louis.

07/02/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Winless in Seattle', 'Jun 30, 2016; Seattle, WA, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Chris Tillman (30) stands on the mound during the fifth inning against the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field. Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have dropped the first two of four games in Seattle and the offence has quieted. Why is this?As always, when the offence disappears for any time, the opposition pitching likely has a lot to do with it. Seattle pitching against the Birds has been quite good, as has their pitching throughout the first half of the season. The Mariners rank third in the American League in ERA and fourth in strikeouts and K/BB ratio. This is the sort of staff that can give the O\xe2\x80\x99s some problems if they are pitching well at all.But the Orioles are helping them out. Baltimore batters have struck out 11 times in both of these first two Seattle games. And we are seeing again some of the wild, overly-aggressive swings at balls well out of the strike zone. Jones, Machado, Alvarez in particular have about swung right out of their shoes on occasions. Why throw a strike when batters do this?At the same time, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have squared-up some balls right at people, as Jones did in the first at-bat last night \xe2\x80\x93 a screamer right at the third baseman. It sorta set the tone. And the Mariners made some especially good defensive plays on Thursday evening.It is no secret that the Orioles need to find a way to win on the road. While being 31-13 at home, they are now 16-19 on the road. The rest of the season from this point forward features 37 home games and 46 away from Baltimore.It would be good also to figure a way to score more against these Mariners and get a couple wins. In five games against Seattle, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have only won a single contest back in Baltimore. And the Birds have scored but 12 runs in the five games. Has this always been a problem?Here is a look at the past four years, noting the seasonal series record, how the Orioles did in Seattle, and the total runs scored by the two teams\xe2\x80\xa6YearSeries@ SEAO\xe2\x80\x99s-M\xe2\x80\x99s20153-31-224-2320145-23-118-1420132-41-229-3520128-15-149-29\xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injury As often appears in studying recent Baltimore history, the great years of 2012 and 2014 have good-looking numbers, whereas the struggles of the odd-numbered seasons can be seen even in the split being considered.So the Orioles need to put together a couple of wins in these final games. And they are going to need Tyler Wilson and Ubaldo Jimenez to keep them in the games and give the offense a chance. Seattle is a good team without doubt, but they are plenty beatable.

07/03/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Tyler Wilson struggles in Seattle', ""Tyler Wilson struggled mightily against Seattle as the Baltimore Orioles fell 12-6.Tyler Wilson struggled from the beginning last night at Safeco Field. I think Jim Hunter on the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 radio network put it best when he said that Wilson wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fooling anyone with anything he\xe2\x80\x99s throwing out there. Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s line: 3.0 IP, 9 H, 8 R, 2 BB, 2 K.Keep in mind that Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s a pitch-to-contact type of pitcher. So in pitching-to-contact, if he\xe2\x80\x99s just a bit off he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hit hard. We saw this a bit also in his previous start last Sunday at home when he at times looked uncomfortable on the mound. That was the case even moreso last night.The O\xe2\x80\x99s found themselves in an immediate 3-0 hole when Cruz sent a three-run homer over the wall in the first inning. Zunino would add a second home run in the second inning, this one of the two-run variety. Before you could say BOO!, the Birds trailed 5-0.\xc2\xa0Live Feed tyler wilsonBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: What's next for Ubaldo Jim\xc3\xa9nez?

Hardy cranked an RBI-single and\xc2\xa0Nolan Reimold an RBI-double in the sixth.Of course the last of the sixth brought three additional Seattle runs as well, including another Zunino homer. That pretty much capped the night as the O\xe2\x80\x99s fell. However Davis would put one out of the park for the Birds in the seventh, a two-run shot. At the end of the day, the Orioles fell 12-6 in Seattle.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerAfter the game Showalter was asked about Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s struggles, and in his view it\xe2\x80\x99s something that happens with a lot of pitchers (quote courtesy of Steve Melewski, MASNsports):He\xe2\x80\x99s just not quite as crisp as he was. He\xe2\x80\x99s in the 80-plus inning mark, and he\xe2\x80\x99s just not carrying the same crispness that he had earlier in the season.

07/04/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Matthew Grimes, Moving On Up', 'Jun 7, 2016; Pittsburgh, PA, USA; General view as MLB baseballs on the field before the Pittsburgh Pirates host the New York Mets in a double header at PNC Park. Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles pitching prospect Matthew Grimes has had one of the lowest ERA stats in the country and has been rewarded with a promotion to AA Bowie.I will ask the readers today to forgive the unusual first-person narrative style of this article. For the past three months, my wife and I have had the privilege of hosting Grimes in our home during his time with the Advanced \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d Frederick Keys. So this is something of a personal story as well as information about a rising prospect in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 system.Grimes is in his third season with the Orioles, having been an 18th-round selection out of Georgia Tech in 2014 and playing immediately with the Aberdeen Iron Birds. There he was 1-3 with a 5.32 ERA in 10 games, five starts. Last year under the outstanding tutelage of Delmarva pitching coach Blaine Beatty, Grimes went 10-7 in 24 starts with a 4.14 ERA.But it is the current season that has put his name on the map in the Orioles farm system. Over 14 games with the Keys, he went 8-4 with a 1.45 ERA, earning Carolina League All-Star status while being named the league\xe2\x80\x99s player of the month in May.A few days ago, Matthew learned that he was being moved up to the Baysox and pitching on Monday night for their July 4th game. Originally scheduled as the starter for this game was Jayson Aquino, who we have now seen has been called up with the Orioles.So Matthew stayed here with us for one last night, got in an hour of fishing with two of my boys, and then packed up his gear to head down the road for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game. He\xe2\x80\x99s movin\xe2\x80\x99 on up to the East Side \xe2\x80\xa6 yes, the east side of the District to pitch for the Bowie Baysox.Playing against the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 AA affiliate the Trenton Thunder, Matthew was rudely welcomed to the Eastern League. Leadoff batter Tyler Wade took an 0-2 pitch deep over the wall for a leadoff home run. But Grimes came back from that to strike out the next three batters. Going a total of 4.2 innings, he gave up three earned runs on six hits (mostly ground balls through the infield) and struck out seven, leaving with a 3-1 deficit.Relying this evening mostly on fast balls and a nasty curve, the appearance was an overall decent outing. The Baysox radio announcer summarized it this way \xe2\x80\xa6The numbers are not going to look great, but I thought that Grimes threw the baseball really well in his Eastern League debut, especially given the rainy conditions throughout the game.Regarding pitching in the rain, from Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, his experience in Maryland is that it rains all the time. I have been telling him that this year is unusual, but it is difficult for him to believe it when it does indeed seem to rain just about every day, as he says, \xe2\x80\x9chere in the north.\xe2\x80\x9dIt was just starting to rain when he was leaving our house, so I have told him that he is the rain magnet, not us!Just after Grimes departed the game, the rain came down harder in Bowie and there was a delay. Again, the announcer said \xe2\x80\xa6It\xe2\x80\x99s kinda frustrating when you look at the radar and see that this is just about the only place in the country where it is raining.\xc2\xa0 Well of course! Matthew Grimes is there! The rain follows him with a storm cloud over his head, kinda like Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh.So is Grimes a legitimate prospect for the Orioles, sooner or later? Even though it is like talking about one of my own kids, I think I am being objective in saying that he certainly is. I have watched him pitch multiple times, and he features four pitches that he commands well. Pounding the strike zone, he only gave up 16 walks in 81 innings at Frederick, with a 1.054 WHIP.Grimes is not listed among the top 30 Orioles prospects in Baseball America. Though there are more than a few MLB players who have been 18th-round or later draftees, guys after the opening rounds have to prove that they can do it, while those at the top have to prove that they can\xe2\x80\x99t.At the same time, it has from the beginning of my knowing Matthew confused me as to why his successes this year are spoken of as a \xe2\x80\x9csurprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s why I say that: Grimes was a fourth-round selection in 2010 out of high school in Georgia, by the White Sox. Ranked at that time as among the best high school pitchers in the country, he chose rather to go to Georgia Tech.At Tech, he suffered the very common young pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s elbow injury, going through Tommy John surgery and the subsequently long recovery. This year is his first without some measure of restriction, now being fully recovered from the worst thing that could happen. He throws consistently in the low 90s, occasionally touching 95. He\xe2\x80\x99s obviously healthy.So it is reasonable in my mind to see Grimes as a true high pick in the draft, only dropping due to the injury. Therefore he is a bargain for the Birds.Orioles fans would look at Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s delivery and approach and immediately notice a similarity to Chris Tillman. The mechanics are similar, as is the 6-6 frame. Throwing \xe2\x80\x9cdownhill\xe2\x80\x9d and using size to his advantage, he actually has better ball movement than does Tillman. His curve, when working, can be devastating. The change is excellent and a slider is in development as a probable put-away pitch of the future. Add command to all of this, and it is a very viable MLB pitching package.

When bad things happen, he just moves on to the next batter and the next situation.I could write on and on about the fun it has been to have him with us \xe2\x80\xa6 about his love for fishing, his pick-up truck, sushi, and his sweet wife, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll spare him the embarrassment in the likely event he reads this!

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles, Ubaldo Jimenez swept away in Seattle', ""Ubaldo Jimenez got knocked around as the Baltimore Orioles fell 9-4 in Seattle and were swept in the four-game set.You have to believe that Seattle had to have studied just about everything that the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters, including\xc2\xa0Ubaldo Jimenez, tended to do coming into this series. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one offering over the course of the entire weekend that Seattle didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have a shot at hitting \xe2\x80\x93 and hitting far, at that. To drive that point home, at one point yesterday Jimenez was conned into a rookie mistake \xe2\x80\x93 balking in a run after a base runner took off. That\xe2\x80\x99s the type of weekend it was for the Orioles.Jimenez wasn\xe2\x80\x99t strong in the wake of two decent outings. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.1 IP, 6 H, 6 R, 3 BB, 3 K. He actually started this game off strong, not allowing a run for the first two innings. In many of his struggles, Jimenez has had troubles from the beginning. However he loaded the bases with nobody out in the last of the third, and Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s Smith happily obliged by hitting a grand slam. Again, Seattle had to have really studied whatever the Orioles were throwing out there coming in \xe2\x80\x93 Smith homered in all four games of this series.However the good news for the O\xe2\x80\x99s is that they battled back \xe2\x80\x93 and quick.\xc2\xa0Mark Trumbo smacked his 24th homer of the season in the top of the fourth, to get the Birds on the board.\xc2\xa0Later in the inning\xc2\xa0J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s two-RBI double cut the Seattle lead to 4-3. At that point, it appeared that the Birds had a shot.\xc2\xa0Live Feed ubaldo jimenezBaltimore Orioles using optionable bullpen to stay ahead The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Fun facts as the first trip to Yankee Stadium gets underway The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles Clicking on All Cylinders The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: What to Make of Recent Stellar Starts by Jimenez, Miley The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: What's next for Ubaldo Jim\xc3\xa9nez? The Baltimore WireHowever Seattle came right back in the last of the fourth. Marte hit a ground-rule RBI-double (when the ball got lodged under the fence), and Jimenez balked in the aforementioned run. Again, that sixth run was typical of this series. Martin took off for second in a steal attempt, and Jimenez stopped his windup \xe2\x80\x93 resulting in a balk. While that\xe2\x80\x99s the type of mistake we\xe2\x80\x99d expect of a rookie, we do have to keep in mind that human beings are still playing this game. And as I said, that\xe2\x80\x99s just how things went for the Orioles for the entire weekend.Trumbo would add an RBI-single in the seventh to bring the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within 6-4. However two RBI-doubles by Seattle in the last of the inning sealed the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fate. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say why the Birds struggled against Seattle this season, as they dropped two-of-three in Baltimore, and all four in Seattle. Sometimes you just don\xe2\x80\x99t match up well against some teams \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s true in all sports.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

"", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles-Dodgers series preview - Camden Chat', ' They first met in 1966, with the Orioles taking the World Series in a four-game sweep that will be celebrated later this summer at Camden Yards. Since then, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have won two more World Series (in 1970 and 1983) and the Dodgers two more as well (1981 and 1988). If the last memory you have of the Dodgers is Kirk Gibson fist-pumping while hobbling around the bases in 1988 that probably means two things: 1) You\xe2\x80\x99re old like me and 2) You don\xe2\x80\x99t watch much National League baseball, also like me.    These aren\xe2\x80\x99t Kirk Gibson\xe2\x80\x99s Dodgers - they aren\xe2\x80\x99t even Don Mattingly\xe2\x80\x99s Dodgers, as the former Yankees player and Dodgers manager parted ways with the club last off-season. Yasiel Puig has come back down to Earth, Clayton Kershaw is injured (as are about 73 other starting pitchers for Los Angeles) and because the Seager brothers haven\xe2\x80\x99t tormented the Orioles enough, Corey Seager leads the team with a 142 OPS+. DISCLAIMER: I grew up an Orioles fan and a Dodgers fan. The Orioles will always come first, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a game in Chavez Ravine, but I was heartbroken when those Damn Yankees beat the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978. Sure, 1981 helped soothe the hurt, but that was a strike year and didn\xe2\x80\x99t really count. 1988 did. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be rooting for the boys in Orange and Black, of course, but the rest of the year? Love Ya Blue, too. And check Twitter for their lineup tweets - they are seriously good. On to the games because ITFDB... Game 1: July 4, 9:10 PM Eastern Yovani Gallardo vs Julio Urias The Dodgers rookie came up to much acclaim, and his first seven starts have been uneven but getting better. He lasted just 2.2 IP in his debut, and left with an ERA over 10. In his last start, he allowed just two runs in 6.0 IP against Milwaukee, although he allowed six walks in that last start. He\xe2\x80\x99s passed the Matusz test every time he\xe2\x80\x99s pitched, with his ERA going down after every start. Then again, when you start with a ERA greater than 10, maybe that isn\xe2\x80\x99t as impressive as it looks. None of the Orioles have faced him, obviously. And here\xe2\x80\x99s the bad news - he\xe2\x80\x99s left-handed.    Yovani Gallardo has won two of his three games started since his return from the disabled list and was no-decisioned in the other. But as Buck Showalter says about Mike Wright\xe2\x80\x99s minor league starts, the results have been better than the pitching. He\xe2\x80\x99s pitched to a 4.43 ERA in those three starts, has allowed nine walks in those 16.1 IP, and surrendered three home runs. To his credit, he\xe2\x80\x99s struck out 14, but that\xe2\x80\x99s some serious luck coming into the equation to get the results he\xe2\x80\x99s been getting.       Game 2: July 2, 10:10 PM Eastern Chris Tillman vs Kenta Maeda OK, raise your hand if you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard of the Dodgers starter. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought. Yet another rookie pitcher from the Dodgers, but this one\xe2\x80\x99s right-handed. He\xe2\x80\x99s been awfully good, with a 2.82 ERA for the season. His WHIP is just 1.090, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a strikeout to walk ratio of 3.18K/1BB and has 89 strikeouts in 92.2 IP. That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good rookie season. Chris Tillman has been seen as the steady presence in the O\xe2\x80\x99s lineup until his last outing, when he did his best Ubaldo Jimenez impersonation. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t last five innings, gave up four runs and took 112 pitches to do it. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of pitches, especially considering he walked only three batters. And while Tillman was 3-0 in his previous five starts before that, he had a .300 BAA and a 4.80 ERA. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have seen it coming.     Game 3: July 6, 3:10 PM Eastern Kevin Gausman vs Bud Norris  Bud Norris takes the place of Clayton Kershaw in the rotation, so the Dodgers shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t skip a beat ... yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably spitting something on your monitor right now, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t type that with a straight face, either. Although, Norris did strike out eight in 6.0 IP in his Dodgers debut while giving up no runs. It would be just like the Orioles to get shut out by Bud Freakin\xe2\x80\x99 Norris, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?  Kevin Gausman will attempt to put together a complete outing Wednesday, which eluded him last time out as he gave up three runs in 6.0 IP on eight hits. But before that start, he was awesome on June 25, pitching 7.2 innings and giving up zero runs and just four hits, striking out seven. Here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping we see the Kevin Gausman of June 25, not the Kevin Gausman of July 1.      ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

""Especially when it gets to 13, 14, 15 or more. Everyone is pretty spent usually. It\'s very taxing.""Schoop drove in Manny Machado and Chris Davis, who had consecutive singles, when center fielder Trayce Thompson tried to a backhanded diving catch and the ball rolled well out of his reach. It was Schoop\'s lone hit.""I was going crazy, but I didn\'t want to show it,"" Schoop said. ""I was really, really excited.""Mychal Givens (6-1) got the win.

The shortstop looks to extend his hitting streak to 19 games and the Dodgers attempt to claim a series victory Wednesday afternoon as they host the rubber match against the Orioles. The 22-year-old Seager, who was named to the National League All-Star team, went 1-for-4 in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s loss to stretch his streak to 18 contests \xe2\x80\x93 the longest by a Dodger since Hanley Ramirez\xe2\x80\x99s 19-game run in 2013 and second-longest by a Dodgers rookie (Tommy Davis, 20 games in 1960). All-Star Manny Machado snapped a 1-1 tie with a three-run homer in the fifth inning and the Orioles went on to improve to 3-5 on their nine-game road trip. The victory halted Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s five-game losing streak and kept its lead over Toronto in the American League East at 2 1/2 games. J.J. Hardy recorded a hit in four at-bats and is 6-for-16 with five RBIs over his last four contests. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (1-6, 3.97 ERA) vs. Dodgers RH Bud Norris (4-7, 3.89) Gausman was unable to ride the momentum from his first victory of the season as he suffered his third loss in four starts Friday at Seattle. The 25-year-old native of Colorado, who scattered four hits over 7 2/3 scoreless innings in a win over Tampa Bay on June 25, allowed three runs and eight hits \xe2\x80\x93 two homers \xe2\x80\x93 in six frames against the Mariners. Gausman, who never has faced Los Angeles, is 0-5 with a 5.02 ERA in eight starts on the road this year. Norris was superb in his debut with the Dodgers on Friday, limiting Colorado to two hits and a walk while striking out eight over six scoreless innings in the victory. It was the second straight brilliant performance by the 31-year-old Californian, who scattered four hits and fanned eight while keeping the New York Mets off the scoreboard over seven frames in his final outing with Atlanta on June 26. Norris lost his only career start against Baltimore on June 6, 2013, when he yielded three runs and nine hits in seven innings while with Houston. WALK-OFFS 1. The Dodgers optioned Julio Urias to Triple-A Oklahoma City and recalled fellow LHP Luis Avilan, who likely will be sent back down on Thursday to make room for LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu. 2.

Orioles won 6-4 in the 14th inning. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles finished a difficult West Coast road trip by winning an epic bullpen battle over the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-4 in 14 innings.There is a reason why the Dodgers are the best come-from-behind team in the National League, while the Orioles are the same in the AL. It has to do with bullpen strength, an impressive asset for both squads. This is increasingly becoming the recognized methodology for building a contending team in Major League Baseball.On Wednesday, the collision of the two bullpens was the baseball equivalent of the immoveable force running into the irresistible object.Both starters \xe2\x80\x93 Kevin Gausman and Bud Norris \xe2\x80\x93 were out of the game after pitching five innings each. The bullpens would battle for nine more innings, throwing shut-out frames until finally the O\xe2\x80\x99s broke through with a pair of runs in the top of the 14th inning. By the time it was over, the Orioles would use six relievers, whereas the Dodgers would go through eight \xe2\x80\x93 the final one needing of necessity to come to the plate with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the 14th.\xc2\xa0 Epic.As with any long, extra-innings game, there are some amazing numbers. Chase Utley proved himself as a leadoff hitter, going 6-for-7 (How many times has a guy ever done that in a losing effort?). Between the two teams there were 36 strikeouts, 18 for each side. The Dodgers had more opportunities, with 16 hits and seven walks; but they were 1-for-14 with runners in scoring position. The O\xe2\x80\x99s 2-for-11 looks very offensive by comparison!A total of 123 batters came to the plate. The combined number of pitches thrown for both sides equaled 526 (249 for the Orioles and 277 for LA). This accounts for the game lasting 5:26. The Orioles can be thankful for the day off on Thursday, flying home to Baltimore.Practically every player for the Orioles had very high and very low moments in the game. Mark Trumbo hit homers 25 and 26 on the year. Jonathan Schoop was 0-for-6 before getting the game-winning double, knocking in two runs. Dylan Bundy registered all seven of his outs by strikeout, but he also gave up three hits and two walks. Chris Davis had four strikeouts but also stroked a critical single in the 14th. He is on pace at this moment to strike out 222 times.

At this point the O\xe2\x80\x99s could really use a couple of long starts against the Angels in the final three games before the All-Star break. What are the chances of that?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles trade rumors: Scouts watched Sonny Gray, Ervin ...', ' The idea that the Orioles are going to have to trade for someone to try to improve the state of their starting rotation gets more support almost on a daily basis. It seems so unlikely that they could hold their slim division lead with that unit continuing to pitch the way it collectively has.    Two big linked questions are out there. Who can the Orioles actually get with their limited trade chips? And just as important, would any of those people represent a meaningful upgrade? There will be plenty of time to figure that out between now and the non-waiver trade deadline. For now, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to know just who the Orioles might be looking at as a possible upgrade. On Wednesday, they had their eyes on both starting pitchers in a game between the Athletics and Twins: Sonny Gray and Ervin Santana. That\xe2\x80\x99s according to the San Francisco Chronicle\xe2\x80\x99s Susan Slusser. The Orioles are hardly the only team that might be interested in one of those players as a potential rotation option. Slusser reported that the Blue Jays, Royals, Marlins, and Cardinals also had scouts in attendance. Any one of those teams could offer more than the Orioles without meaningfully depleting their farm systems.    Sonny Gray Gray, aside from having a name that fits perfectly into the cadence of the beginning of the Sesame Street theme song, has long been figured to be a trade chip this season because he\xe2\x80\x99s relatively young, coming off of two full successful seasons, and on top of that, the Athletics team is going nowhere.    In each of the past two seasons, Gray topped 200 innings pitched and his combined ERA in those games was 2.91. There was a lot to like even for those who prefer more abstract measures of evaluating pitching, with Gray\xe2\x80\x99s FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching) being 3.46 in the past two seasons.  That\xe2\x80\x99s not Cy Young-winning material but it\xe2\x80\x99s still very good. Gray would have topped the Orioles rotation in either ERA or FIP in either of the last two seasons.    The problem with Gray is this season. After 16 games, Gray has a 5.16 ERA. There\xe2\x80\x99s always the chance this will open the door to buy low on a guy who could go back to being successful very easily - and provide a team with three full years of starts beyond this one. You\xe2\x80\x99d have to be nervous about swinging a big trade for a guy with a 5+ ERA and a WHIP of 1.467 to date. The Orioles and fixing broken starting pitchers aren\xe2\x80\x99t concepts that tend to go together. Although they took a look at him, the pedigree of the last couple of seasons is probably going to put Gray out of their price range as far as what they have to offer. Ervin Santana My basic rule for this trade deadline is that the Orioles won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get anyone you would actually want to have on the team. Santana is just bad enough that the Orioles might be able to get him. You probably don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have him on the team.    If scouts were looking to be impressed by Santana\xe2\x80\x99s start yesterday, they might have been swayed by his pitching a complete game shutout. On the other hand, who cares about one start against the Athletics? They are 15th in the AL in on-base percentage and 14th in slugging percentage. Their team is bad and their offense is a big reason why. For the season as a whole, Santana has a 4.06 ERA in 16 starts. That\xe2\x80\x99s in line with a 4.09 FIP. He\xe2\x80\x99s averaging a bit more than 5.2 innings per games started. It\xe2\x80\x99s also similar to the results Santana posted last season before getting suspended 80 games for testing positive for Stanozolol, a no-no in baseball\xe2\x80\x99s drug testing regime. That\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of baggage to be carrying around. Of course, the Orioles had some success in bringing on Nelson Cruz, suspended as a result of the Biogenesis investigation, but that was a lot more of a bargain than Santana might be. He\xe2\x80\x99s owed $13.5 million this season and each of the next two seasons and he\xe2\x80\x99s already 33 years old. Santana has also been heavily homer-prone in his career. Even a successful 2013 campaign in Kansas City still saw him give up 26 home runs, 18 of which he gave up in what\xe2\x80\x99s generally seen as a pitcher-friendly home park. Bringing those tendencies regularly to Oriole Park at Camden Yards seems like a bad idea. The numbers are not overwhelming. On the other hand, unlike some other pitchers we might name, Santana has held his velocity into his 30s - the 92.5mph he averages this year is in line with most of the numbers of his early career when he was in Anaheim. The risk of him getting here and turning into a pumpkin seems to be lower.    Of course, if it turns out he\xe2\x80\x99s actually not that bad, some team with real prospects and a need in their rotation might swoop in and get him instead. So even if you can talk yourself into Santana being alright, don\xe2\x80\x99t get your hopes up.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles reliever Brad Brach is among the most unlikely All ...', "" As All-Stars go, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get much more unlikely than Orioles reliever Brad Brach.    For the most part, pitchers don\xe2\x80\x99t get named to the team unless they are very good starting pitchers or very good closers. Not only is Brach not a closer, but when the season began, he was not even really a primary set-up man, slotting in for mostly seventh inning duty with Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day being the eighth inning guy. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like Brach is playing on a team where he was the token selection. The Orioles, with four other All-Stars, including Manny Machado in the starting lineup, were not exactly hurting for players being named to the squad for the Midsummer Classic. For the last month, since O\xe2\x80\x99Day landed on the disabled list with a hamstring strain, Brach has been the guy ahead of Zach Britton. He has pitched so well that he simply could not be ignored when Royals manager Ned Yost was picking pitchers for the AL team.    Even in today\xe2\x80\x99s game, with more importance than ever placed on the team\xe2\x80\x99s two or three best guys at the back end of the bullpen, what Brach has done so far is absurd. A sub-1.00 ERA is just ridiculous, yet Brach, after 1.2 scoreless innings on Wednesday, has lowered that number to 0.95. This is crazy.    Brach\xe2\x80\x99s WHIP is possibly even more gaudy than his ERA. He\xe2\x80\x99s now thrown 47.1 innings on the season over 38 games, giving him value as an occasional multi-inning reliever in a way that very few of his peers can match. Over those innings, Brach has only allowed 24 hits and 14 walks. That adds up to a WHIP of 0.803. Oh yeah, and he\xe2\x80\x99s struck out 56 batters. No wonder he\xe2\x80\x99s got such a low ERA. When you have an arsenal with that kind of command and strikeout potential, there just aren\xe2\x80\x99t many opportunities to get on base. It\xe2\x80\x99s impressive, so much so that he forced his way onto the All-Star team despite not being a closer.    So unlikely that not everyone likes it Not that everyone in the baseball media world is a fan of the decision to have Brach on the team. ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Keith Law - as if it could have been anyone else - picked Brach as one of his five All-Star selections who do NOT belong on the All-Star team, writing: What the hell is Brad Brach doing on an All-Star roster? He was replacement-level until last year and barely better than that in 2015, and he has a fluke performance of 1.01 ERA in 44 innings this year ... Brach is emblematic of the worst tendencies of the All-Star decision-making process with both the emphasis on current-year performance and the overrating of middle relievers. ... This spot should have gone to (White Sox starter Jose) Quintana, to pick just one of a few dozen more deserving players. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going on there. It\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to accept that some starting pitchers might have been more deserving All-Stars. Quintana would have been a fine All-Star. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why he\xe2\x80\x99s not on the team. One curiosity of the AL roster compared to the NL one is that it is so reliever-heavy. There are nine starting pitchers on the NL roster, with only five on the AL roster.     Are there really a \xe2\x80\x9cfew dozen more\xe2\x80\x9d players who should be on there than Brach, though? This is a bit tougher to accept, especially with Law painting Brach\xe2\x80\x99s performance as \xe2\x80\x9ca fluke\xe2\x80\x9d and labeling his 2015 as \xe2\x80\x9cbarely better than\xe2\x80\x9d replacement level. Brach\xe2\x80\x99s first half could be a fluke, of course. Orioles fans don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Neither does Law, who, on Twitter, cited Pat Neshek\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 as his precedent - 0.70 ERA before the All-Star game, 3.74 ERA afterwards. And depending on which WAR you consult, Brach was worth either 0.9 or 2.0 last year, not exactly \xe2\x80\x9cbarely better\xe2\x80\x9d than replacement. This year already, Brach\xe2\x80\x99s worth either 1.1 or 2.5 WAR to date. By the way, Neshek ended that 2014 season with a 1.87 ERA. That is an elite level for a reliever, even if he was much better in the first half. At the start of his column, Law states his overriding philosophy about All-Star selections: \xe2\x80\x9cIt's a marketing event for baseball -- not a popularity contest and not a way to reward first-half flukes.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s not kidding about his belief in the All-Star Game as a marketing event. Despite what he says above about Brach regarding current-year performance and overrating middle relievers, later in the column, Law takes issue with the inclusion of Marlins closer A.J. Ramos and suggests an alternative.    The alternative he offers Cardinals reliever Seung-hwan Oh - a Korean player in his MLB rookie season, who is also not a closer, and in fact is about as much of a middle reliever as is Brach. Oh\xe2\x80\x99s having a great season too, if not as great as Brach\xe2\x80\x99s to date. The most unlikely All-Star Brach on the All-Star roster is probably not bringing many viewers to the table, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. Maybe the cheering section from back in Freehold, NJ will be tuning in and that\xe2\x80\x99s about it. Yet all of those people out there who want to knock against Brach making the team because he\xe2\x80\x99s not one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s marketable names miss what makes him such a great and unlikely All-Star. Brach\xe2\x80\x99s career trajectory was not exactly traditional. He was drafted in the 42nd round of the 2008 draft. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t even a 42nd round in the draft any more. That\xe2\x80\x99s how far down there Brach was. He was a 22-year-old reliever when he was drafted. He never even went through the illusion of trying to be a starting pitcher in the professional ranks. Yet Brach kept on pitching, old for every level he ever appeared in, starting with Rookie league up until, finally, when he had earned his way to Triple-A Tucson in the Padres organization, he was at last younger than the average player at the level.     Even so, Brach was 25 years old by then, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly stick in the big leagues for good right away. Two years down the road, he was just another guy who could be optioned to the minors, and after a 2013 campaign in which Brach posted a respectable enough 3.19 ERA that masked an unsightly 1.774 WHIP. That\xe2\x80\x99s bad. No wonder they were willing to trade him to the Orioles for a Double-A pitcher, Devin Jones, who pitched in all of nine games in the Padres system. Jones had a 7.23 ERA in those games. As much as people bash Dan Duquette trades, he pulled off a good one here. Brach deserves credit too. He worked every step of the way to get to the big leagues and it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that he\xe2\x80\x99s kept working hard since coming to Baltimore. Brach has been better every year he\xe2\x80\x99s been here, and last year he was even improving as the season went along. Is it a fluke? Who cares? That\xe2\x80\x99s missing the point. Of course Brach\xe2\x80\x99s probably not going to have a sub-1.00 ERA at season\xe2\x80\x99s end. No one is that good. Not even 13-time All-Star Mariano Rivera ever pulled that one off. Even if this is the three month ride of his life and Brach is never this good again - though I hope he is - his All-Star selection is still a win for all of the grinders out there. The All-Star Game, and the game of baseball in general, is the richer for having guys like Brach be recognized in its exhibition full of stars. To be sure, Brach is not one of the young guns - he\xe2\x80\x99s 30 - and he\xe2\x80\x99s not one of the superstars.     Yet if you look down in the minor leagues, there are not many players who can honestly look in the mirror and tell themselves, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to be the next Mike Trout.\xe2\x80\x9d If they work hard, though, and if things go just right, there are more than a few hard workers who could be the next Brad Brach. Brach making the All-Star team, as much of an unlikely All-Star as he may be, is something that should be celebrated rather than panned. He might not even pitch, and in fact, O\xe2\x80\x99s fans might rather he get a few days rest, but that former 42nd round pick gets to be an All-Star and that\xe2\x80\x99s as cool as it gets.

07/08/2016,"[('Orioles Notebook: trading a postion player and minor ...', ' Trading a position player... There has lots of talk around the internet about trading a major league position player for some starting pitching reinforcements. The Orioles rotation has been bad, very bad, outside of Chris Tillman no one has an ERA under four in the starting rotation. If you take away Kevin Gausman and Tillman no one has an ERA under 5.67 except for Vance Worley who only made one start.     This is bad. The Orioles need only competence from their starting rotation and thus far it has been the three stooges manning the back of the rotation. Even in first place by 2.5 games and 14 games above .500 everyone can see, including the Orioles front office, that this level of poor performance will cost the team eventually.  With trades of recent vintage the Orioles minor league depth has been pilfered and the minor league depth on hand has been found wanting. One way to improve the pitching staff would be to improve the outfield defense which continues to be dreadful. However, some of the worst Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 defenders are also some of their better hitters and baseball does not allow three designated hitters.  The other way to improve the rotation would be through a trade, however as I talked about before the Orioles minor league depth is sparse. Other teams are in the hunt for quality starting pitching as well and teams like the Red Sox and Rangers have much better minor league systems to deal from.     So, as the thinking goes, take a little from the everyday lineup and put it towards fixing the rotation. The offense is great so removing one player from it won\xe2\x80\x99t cost the Orioles much and another quality pitcher will fix what ails the rotation. Again, as the thinking goes.     I think that is poor thinking. You should not \xe2\x80\x9crob Peter to pay Paul.\xe2\x80\x9d There is a good amount of evidence that having good hitters throughout the lineup creates a stacking effect leading to higher run scoring than expected. You can read here and here about how adding good hitters to good lineups leads to more run scoring.  The basic rundown is that since hitters preform better with men on base the same player inserted into a weaker lineup would not produce the same amount of overall run scoring for the team. Therefore, having strength up and down the lineup is what gives the Orioles offense an advantage and what propels them to be one of the best offenses in the leagues.     So, trading Mark Trumbo or Jonathan Schoop for pitching help weakens the offense to a greater degree than one pitcher will help the weak rotation. However, having said all of that there is one position player that makes some sense to trade and that is J.J. Hardy. He is under contract through next year for $14 million and has a $14 million option in 2018 with a $2 million buyout.  That is a pretty team friendly contract and gives whomever is trading for him more than a rental which opens up the market to teams that are looking for shortstop help and looking to compete next year. I cannot think of many teams off the top of my head that fit this category, but J.J. Hardy is a valuable player still and for the right team makes some sense.     For the Orioles it makes sense for a couple of reasons. One, the replacement shortstop is already on the roster. Manny Machado filled in for Hardy exceptionally well while Hardy was on the DL. Two, Ryan Flaherty could move to 3B.  Hardy has not been a good hitter in 1.5 years so if he is moved the Orioles everyday lineup has the same number of weak hitters as before (really just the one). Therefore, the offense is not hurt much at all either.  Hardy may not have the highest trade value and I\xe2\x80\x99m not really advocating trading him away. However, if people are going to talk about trading away a position player, his name makes a lot more sense than some others.  Developing Relievers  Developing major league relievers can be hard. Getting into games not all that often and only facing a couple of hitters at a time can make it difficult for pitchers to learn how to get hitters out. That is why many relievers in the major leagues are failed minor league starters. However, combing through the minor league box scores I noticed something interesting the the Orioles have been doing with their minor league relievers.   Jon Keller, 20 Games, 29.2 IP Ashur Tolliver, 25 Games, 34.2 IP Tanner Scott, 25 Games, 43.1 IP Garrett Cleavinger, 20 Games, 48.1 IP Jay Flaa, 17 Games, 29.1 IP Christian Turnipseed, 24 Games, 33.0 IP  None of these pitchers are starters or have started a game for an Orioles minor league team, but they all have more innings pitched than games appeared in and some by quite a large margin. Think of Brad Brach or Mychal Givens on the current roster who often go above and beyond one inning pitched giving Buck Showalter a lot more bullpen flexibility.     The Orioles seem to be attempting the same thing with their minor league relievers. Let them pitch to left and right handed batters, maybe work through a lineup. There are probably even more guys then I picked up on, but these were the ones I found through a cursory glance. Maybe the Orioles have a pitching development plan after all.   ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles lose to Angels, 9-5; Ubaldo Jimenez again falls ...', ' There have been better Friday nights in the history of Baltimore baseball ... much better nights. The Angels were the better team from the first pitch in this series opener. For Ubaldo Jimenez, he falls to 5-9 after this very disappointing outing.    The recap It\xe2\x80\x99s never a good thing when the bullpen begins stirring in the top of the first inning. On this particular night, Ubaldo Jimenez was the culprit of quite a few early, ugly stares from the Camden Yards faithful.  In the top of the first, Jimenez allowed a walk-single-single-wild pitch sequence, surrendering RBI to Albert Pujols (single) and C.J. Cron (groundout) before he could record a pair of outs. The Angels led 2-0 after the first half inning of play, not enough however to discourage the threat of the Birds offense. Adam Jones blasted a solo home run on the first pitch he saw from LAA starter Matt Shoemaker, drilling the first O\xe2\x80\x99s run of the game deep into center field. The mammoth dinger was Jones\xe2\x80\x99 17th of 2016.      Home run, Adam Jones. And just like that, the #Orioles trail 2-1. pic.twitter.com/Is5174TWkA\xe2\x80\x94 Jon Meoli (@JonMeoli) July 8, 2016    After Jimenez consistently missed the zone to begin the second inning of play, the MASN cameras again shifted to the \xe2\x80\x98pen to show Mike Wright rapidly loosening up. And as the script has followed throughout much of the season, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long before Jimenez would need the help.    With runners on first and third, Yunel Escobar grounded a hard single up the middle to boost the Angels lead to 3-1. The next batter, Kole Calhoun, roped another hard-hit shot to right field to make the score 4-1, effectively ending the night for Jimenez.  Wright would get the call from the skipper after the early mess - he stranded Calhoun at first, but Mike Trout managed a sacrifice fly on the first pitch Wright threw to increase the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s lead to 5-1.     Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s final line: 1.1 IP, 5 hits, 5 earned runs, 2 walks, 0 strikeouts Wright did technically enter the game to save Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s poor outing, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite go as planned. Two hit-by-pitches, a walk and two productive Angels outs led to two runs in the top of the fourth, making it 8-1 and, obviously, putting things out of reach.  Jonathan Schoop crushed a deep, deep blast to left in the bottom of the fourth to double the O\xe2\x80\x99s score, but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop the Angels from scoring. They kept pressing Wright, tacking on plenty of baserunners and another run in the sixth to again bump their lead to seven.    With the score at 9-2 in the bottom of the sixth, things got just interesting enough to give the full Camden Yards crowd a sliver a hope before it was abruptly swiped away.  After Shoemaker allowed a single to Manny Machado and walked Chris Davis, Mark Trumbo looped an RBI single to left to score #13. That made it 9-3, as Mike Scioscia went to his bullpen, calling upon fastball-heavy righty Cam Bedrosian. With runners at first and second with one out, Jonathan Schoop was hit in the helmet by a 94 MPH fastball (he walked to first and was cleared by Richie Bancells) to load the bases for eight-hole hitter Pedro Alvarez. He struck out, leaving J.J. Hardy to either severely dent the Angels lead, or to send fans briskly walking to the parking lot.  Unfortunately, the latter became the reality. He fanned on a check swing, ending the inning and effectively forcing three final innings of - for lack of a better term - garbage time. On the bright side, Chaz Roe entered in the seventh and worked two fantastic innings of baseball, while Odrisamer Despaigne did the same in the ninth. The offense couldn\xe2\x80\x99t claw their way back into the win column, but perhaps positive Roe and Despaigne news is the perfect ending to this very imperfect game.     Now at 49-36, the Orioles will finish up this home series against the Angels and potentially capture their 50th win before taking what appears to be a much-needed All-Star hiatus.  Other notables  Mark Trumbo crushed a line-drive HR to left in the ninth inning to boost his season total to 27. Watching him in the Home Run Derby on Monday is going to be a treat. J.J. Hardy had a pair of errors on the night, two ground balls. Perhaps getting them out of the way in games like these isn\xe2\x80\x99t the worst thing in the world.

Los Angeles Angels defeated Baltimore Orioles 9-5. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles, despite their overall good record, have allowed too many early runs in games.This is of course symptomatic of a very troubled rotation. And even the better pitchers on the Orioles have a tendency to yield too many first-innings runs (i.e. Chris Tillman).Falling behind early in games puts a great deal of pressure on the offense, though fortunately the Orioles have a lineup that can and does come back. That the Orioles rank among the best couple of teams in the game in come-from-behind wins is not only a statement about the powerful lineup, it also is the product of deficits due to poor starting pitching.The problem appeared again last night, predictably with Ubaldo Jimenez starting. On a night honoring the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first World Series Championship team of 50 years ago, it was not a good sign that UJ, in only 1.1 innings of pitching, gave up 2.5 times more runs than the entire pitching staff did in the 1966 Series.This simply has to be the end of the road for Jimenez. The word from the beat writers covering the Orioles is that they are willing to eat the money and let him go. It is time. Heck, it is well past time! In baseball equivalency, we are in about the 15th or 16th inning of patience.Even so, Mike Wright was not categorically better. Scioscia is an attitudinal pain in the derriere to watch hanging over the dugout railing with his chin on folded arms. But can you blame him for being irritated by watching the same pitcher ding three of his guys, including breaking the hand of one of them?At the end of the night, the Orioles went down to defeat 9-5. They did hit three home runs and were only set down in order in one of the nine innings. But the Birds failed to capitalize on opportunities, going 1-for-8 with runners in scoring positions. And you know you\xe2\x80\x99re not destined to win when J.J. Hardy makes errors on back-to-back plays.For the season, the first innings numbers for Baltimore are really quite dreadful. The staff has given up a total of 62 runs, which is equal to 6.56 per nine innings. The O\xe2\x80\x99s offense has scored 46 first inning runs. The only other inning that comes close to these numbers for Baltimore pitching is the sixth, actually worse at a 6.88 per nine innings rate. Of course we have seen this be a difficult transition inning when starters are struggling to truly get deep into the game.If you think it was a rough night for the Birds, the Bowie Baysox had it worse. They dropped a game to the Reading Phillies by a final score of 21-4, giving up all of those runs in the first five innings. Just trying to be like the Big Club, I guess. The Reading team has a record of 62-26, possibly still the best in all levels of baseball.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles will stand alone atop the AL East at the All-Star break, thanks to another home run by Mark Trumbo and a comeback fueled by an unusual balk.Jonathan Schoop trotted home with the tying run in the seventh inning and delivered the decisive RBI single in the eighth to carry Baltimore past the Los Angeles Angels 3-2 Saturday.The Orioles have been alone in first place since June 16 and will remain there through the break, which begins after the conclusion of Sunday\'s schedule.""Obviously, it\'s the end game we\'re after,"" manager Buck Showalter said.Right-hander Yovani Gallardo, who allowed two runs in five-plus innings, said, ""Being in first place going into the All-Star break, it\'s good. But we all understand we\'ve got a long way to go.""Baltimore\'s immediate goal is to hit the break with another victory after splitting the first two games of the series.""We\'ve just got to finish strong, then get three days\' rest and come back next half stronger,"" Schoop said.Trumbo hit his major league leading 28th home run for Baltimore, a solo shot in the second inning. It was the Orioles\' 135th homer of the season, their most before the break.Angels starter Nick Tropeano gave up one run and five hits in six innings, striking out eight. He left with a 2-1 lead, but the bullpen promptly gave it away.After the Orioles got runners to second and third in the seventh against JC Ramirez, Joe Smith (1-4) came in and immediately dropped the ball from the set position for a balk, enabling Schoop to score.""I just messed up. That\'s the most embarrassing moment I\'ve ever had on a baseball field,"" Smith said. ""That was 100 percent my fault.""In the eighth, Manny Machado and Chris Davis singled before Schoop lined a single to center to bring in the go-ahead run.Brad Brach (6-1) worked the eighth and Zach Britton finished for his 26th save. Both relievers are going to the All-Star Game.Daniel Nava had two RBIs for the Angels, who were bidding for their season-high fifth straight win.""We had some opportunities to break the game open,"" manager Mike Scioscia said. ""So obviously, there\'s going to be a spotlight on the balk in the seventh inning, but there\'s a lot of things that led up to that.""Limited to three hits over the first five innings, Los Angeles erased a 1-0 deficit in the sixth. Two singles and a walk loaded the bases for Nava, who ripped a two-run single off the right-field scoreboard.Mychal Givens replaced Gallardo and pitched out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam. In the seventh, Givens struck out Mike Trout with two outs and a runner on third.One of the game\'s finest defensive plays occurred in the fifth inning. After Jett Bandy hit a liner off the wall in left-center, Adam Jones barehanded the carom and zipped a throw to second base for the out. Andrelton Simmons followed with an inconsequential single.STREAKYAngels: Simmons extended his hitting streak to 11 games. ... Yunel Escobar\'s hitting streak ended at 13 games.Orioles: Brach extended his scoreless streak to 10 games and 12 2/3 innings. ... Schoop has hit safely in eight straight games and 19 of his last 20.TRAINER\'S ROOMAngels: C.J. Cron was placed on the DL late Friday with a fractured left hand, so Ji-Man Choi and Jefry Marte will split time at 1B, Scioscia said.Orioles: Setup man Darren O\'Day (right hamstring strain) will throw on flat ground Sunday. There is no timetable for his return. ""We need to get him back,"" Showalter said.

07/12/2016,"[('American League wins World Series home field for Orioles ...', ' As it ended up, the most noteworthy thing about the 2016 All-Star Game for Orioles fans is that Major League Baseball screwed Baltimore out of getting to host this year\xe2\x80\x99s edition of the game as punishment for carrying on the fight in the MASN case.    If that\xe2\x80\x99s a new story to you, check out this article from Baseball Prospectus last year which makes the strong suggestion that the Orioles were all lined up to host this year\xe2\x80\x99s game until suddenly they weren\xe2\x80\x99t. The belief that the MASN fight and the Orioles not hosting are connected was stated directly by a couple of people around baseball during tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game. The next most noteworthy thing is that the American League won the contest, 4-2, with Zach Britton picking up the save, so if the Orioles do somehow make it to the World Series, that means that the first two games and games 6 and 7 would be hosted in Baltimore. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of baseball between now and then. Other than that, there really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much to talk about. The three Orioles batters, Manny Machado, Matt Wieters, and Mark Trumbo, combined to go 0-6, with only Trumbo reaching base at all, and that only because of a fielding error. Machado only saw six pitches in three at-bats.    There was one amusing play in the field for Machado. In the fifth inning, Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s Nolan Arenado hit a lazy ground ball towards shortstop with a runner already on first base. Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts, who is a poor man\xe2\x80\x99s Machado, stood his ground and waited for the ball to roll to him.    Machado did not feel like waiting around for the ball, so he cut over from his third base position to get in front of the ball, field it, and flip to second base to get the lead runner. Bogaerts, waiting on the ball, could have probably only gotten an out at first. This may have saved a run for the AL squad as the next batter, Wil Myers, hit a double that was not able to score Arenado from first, even with two outs.    Britton\xe2\x80\x99s ninth inning saw him record three outs on three ground balls, which is what he tends to do in regular games too. One of them snuck through the infield. Another was a comebacker to Britton that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t field quickly enough to turn a double play. The third was a game-ending double play. The fifth Orioles All-Star, Brad Brach, did not get into the game, although he did at least get up and warm when Blue Jays starter Aaron Sanchez ran into a little bit of trouble in the fourth inning. As for the rest of the game, all four American League runs were driven in by two Royals players, Eric Hosmer and Salvador Perez. Each one homered in the second inning. Hosmer also had an RBI single in the third inning. He was named MVP of the game.    There will now be two days with no baseball. We will make it through this somehow. The good news is that the Orioles will be in first place the whole time.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Tuesday Bird Droppings: The calm before the All-Star Game ...', ' Hello, friends. As of this posting, there are approximately 84 hours remaining until the next Orioles game. That\'s no fun at all, although at least there will be the All-Star Game coming up tonight, with five O\'s on the American League team. At some point or another, three or four of them should even get to play in the game, so O\'s fans can find something to enjoy about the game.    We\'ve come a long way from the days when there were six years in a row with just a single Orioles All-Star. I don\'t think I\'ll ever forget the season where the only All-Star was Ty Wigginton. Poor Nick Markakis never did get his shot even though he deserved one, but the ""there can only be one"" rule screwed him on too many bad Orioles teams. So it goes. One positive of the All-Star layoff is that the Orioles remain in first place the entire time. There\'s no such thing as a bad baseball day where the Orioles end up in first place. That will have to carry us through the days off. After the break, it\'ll probably be up to the starting rotation. That\'s a much scarier thought. But enough worrying about that right now. Manny Machado is batting third in the All-Star Game. The Orioles have two sub-1.00 ERA relievers on the All-Star roster. Mark Trumbo has hit 28 home runs and counting. This has been a fun season so far and there could be a lot more fun still to come.    Around the blogO\'sphere Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 party of five All-Stars overcame adversity en route to San Diego - Baltimore SunThe Sun doesn\'t appear to have actually sent their summer intern to San Diego, but they did let him write an All-Star story based on stuff the Orioles said before they left town.    Myriad O\'s thoughts: Humble Tillman snubbed; Britton\'s surge; first-half, first-place - BaltimoreBaseball.comDan Connolly thinks that Chris Tillman should have been an All-Star. He\'s wrong, of course. Hear him out anyway. The Fun Index: Ranking the All-Stars based on how fun they are (ESPN)Some ESPN guy went to the trouble of ranking All-Stars from most fun to least fun. In his judgment, Mookie Betts, Francisco Lindor, and Paul Goldschmidt, among others, are all ahead of Manny Machado. OK? Naturally, he doesn\'t even rank Brad Brach.    Showalter confident in the roster he has right now - Baltimore SunHe would say this exact thing even if the Orioles had the second-worst starting rotation in the American League... which, come to think of it, they do. Dan Duquette on the Orioles\' All-Stars  - School of RochOne thing Dan Duquette will tell to anyone listening, and some people who aren\'t, is that the Orioles have the most All-Star selections in the AL since 2012. Davis on the first half, Duquette on the rotation, Brach on All-Star nod - Steve MelewskiAnother thing Duquette will tell to anyone listening is that there are 15 teams looking for starting pitching help. This is his way of telling you that the Orioles aren\'t going to trade for any starting pitcher who matters, regardless of how bad they need one.    Birthdays and anniversaries Of all of the players to ever play for the Orioles, just one ever had a birthday today: the late pitcher Jack Harshman from the 1958-59 Orioles. Is today your birthday? Happy birthday! Your birthday buddies for today include: Walden author Henry David Thoreau (1817), Eastman Kodak founder George Eastman (1854), Rodgers and Hammerstein\'s Oscar Hammerstein II (1895), old-time NASCAR driver and broadcaster Benny Parsons (1941), gold medal figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi (1971), wrestler/MMA fighter Brock Lesnar (1977), That 70\'s Show\'s Topher Grace (1978), and Fast & Furious actress Michelle Rodriguez (1978). On this day in history... In 1191, in the Third Crusade, Saladin\'s garrison at Acre surrendered to King Philip Augustus of France. In 1543, King Henry VIII of England married his sixth and final wife, Catherine Parr. In 1804, Alexander Hamilton died, having been shot in a duel with Aaron Burr the day before. Centuries later, D\'Angelo and Wallace would have a disagreement about whether Hamilton was ever a president. Also, I hear there\'s a musical about Hamilton now or something? Crazy.    In 1862, the Medal of Honor was authorized by the United States Congress. Since then, the award has been given out to 3,494 men and one woman. Over half were given out during the Civil War. On July 18, Lt. Col. Charles Kettles will receive a Medal of Honor for action undertaken as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam on May 15, 1967. ** And that\'s the way it is in Birdland on July 12 - or at least, unless something happens later.

But rather than looking at the standings, it may be more instructive to compare each team with its expectations before the season began.Bovada, like many oddsmakers, posted an over/under total for each team in March, a guess on how many games each team would win. Oddsmakers usually know what they are talking about. The three teams expected to slip the most this year \xe2\x80\x94 the Cardinals, the Pirates and the Royals \xe2\x80\x94 are all running well behind their winning percentages from last season. Three teams expected to improve significantly \xe2\x80\x94 the Red Sox, the Marlins and the Tigers \xe2\x80\x94 have all done so.Therefore, it seems perfectly fair to judge teams on a curve of sorts. It matters less if you are good or bad, and more on whether you are an overachiever or an underachiever.First, the top grades.3. Texas Rangers, 54-36, projects to 97 wins. Over/under: 84.5.Texas was a solid 88-74 last season and made the playoffs. But the Astros were the popular pick to win the American League West this season, in part because Texas lost starter Yovani Gallardo to the Orioles in free agency. Instead, the Rangers have raced to the best record in the league and a five-and-a-half-game division lead. Cole Hamels is 9-2, and Ian Desmond is hitting .322 with 15 homers. While no one has most valuable player numbers, almost no key player is not pulling his weight. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      One concern is that the Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 run differential is only third in the division, trailing the Mariners and the Astros, a sign that some above-average luck has helped the team so far.

Improvement was expected this season from those who were entranced by the one-two pitching punch of Madison Bumgarner and Johnny Cueto, the nine-figure free-agent signing . They were right. Bumgarner is 10-4 and Cueto 13-1, and the Giants have the best record in baseball.1. Baltimore Orioles, 51-36, projects to 95 wins. Over/under: 79.5.Although the Orioles are not having as great a season as the Giants, the curve thrusts them to the top of the table. While the Giants were expected to be a solid winning team, Baltimore was expected to be thoroughly mediocre. Last year the Orioles were 81-81, and their pitching staff for this season was seen as particularly thin. The tough A.L. East was also seen as a hurdle.But behind Chris Tillman (12-2) and Mark Trumbo (a startling major-league-leading 28 home runs), the Orioles are leading the A.L. East.

Their manager, Fredi Gonzalez, was the first one fired this season, with the team\xe2\x80\x99s record at 9-28. But the Braves are a more respectable 22-30 since. And a bad Braves team was expected anyway: Their over/under was 66.5, the worst of any team but the Phillies (65.5). So while their projection of 56 wins is bad, the team is not underachieving badly enough to make the top three.

But oddsmakers have never liked the Royals very much, and gave them an over/under of only 85.5. The Cardinals, who had the best record in baseball at 100-62 last season, are only 46-42. But oddsmakers correctly guessed they would fall off, giving them an over/under of only 87.5 because of the losses of John Lackey and Jason Heyward to the rival Cubs in free agency.3. Arizona Diamondbacks, 38-52, projects to 68 wins. Over/under 82.5.Take a team just below .500 and add Zack Greinke, and you should get a winning team, right? What if Paul Goldschmidt continues to kill the ball and Jake Lamb has a breakthrough season? Despite these good things, Arizona is a mess. Greinke started well, but is now on the disabled list, and no other regular starter has a winning record; despite a 7.14 E.R.A., Shelby Miller has been given 14 starts. Reports are swirling that the Diamondbacks are going to give up on the season and trade Greinke.2. Los Angeles Angels, 37-52, projects to 67 wins. Over/under 81.5.After an 85-77 season last year, last place in the A.L. West looks pretty bad. Mike Trout is hitting great, as usual, but receiving little support, and the pitching has been shaky.

Ubaldo Jimenez went 5-9 with a 7.38 ERA, Kevin Gausman was 1-6 and Yovani Gallardo has yet to reach a groove after spending nearly two months on the disabled list. Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson were shuffled back and forth from the minors, doing little to warrant an extended stay in Baltimore.""I think I can speak on behalf of all of us \xe2\x80\x94 we can definitely do better,"" Gausman said.If the Orioles are to complete their run to the AL East title and flourish in the postseason, they can either fix the problem or hope to win in spite of it.""It\'s worked out so far,"" said Chris Davis, whose 22 homers ranks second on the team behind Mark Trumbo\'s major-league best 28. ""Obviously at some point you have to start pitching a little bit better out of the starting rotation, but for the most part we\'ve been able to pick them up with our bats.""The Orioles have power and an air-tight infield. Britton has converted every one of his 27 save opportunities. But that one missing element could upend Baltimore\'s bid to outlast Boston and Toronto in the talent-laden division.""Obviously, the biggest thing for us going forward is pitching,"" Britton said. ""Very rarely do teams get through the postseason just on hitting. We\'re going to have to find a way to pitch a little bit better.""Or, executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette can hunt down another viable starter before the non-waiver trade deadline.Two years ago, Duquette shored up the bullpen by getting standout reliever Andrew Miller, proving that if a deal needs to be made he won\'t hesitate to swap potential big leaguers for immediate help.""They know what we need and we know what we need. It\'s just a matter of getting it done,"" Orioles third baseman Manny Machado said. ""I\'ve got faith in the front office. If we need somebody, they\'re going to go out and get them.""Manager Buck Showalter is willing to move forward without outside assistance.""Help is right here this group. We are not coveting other people\'s players,"" Showalter insisted. ""Every answer we need to have is in here.""Baltimore went 51-36 before the break, so maybe Showalter has a point.""The bottom line to this whole thing is to score one more run than the other team, even if it\'s 7-6,"" Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ""Where you might look at their rotation and see guys who may be struggling a little bit, they\'re always in a game because of their ability to hit the ball out of the park. And when they do get a lead, they\'ve got a pen that is even deeper than just the two guys on the back end.""The bullpen lacks a proven left-hander, but the relief corps should improve later this month when setup man Darren O\'Day gets off the disabled list following a right hamstring strain.If Trumbo, Davis, Machado and catcher Matt Wieters continue to whack the ball, the efficiency of the pitching staff might not matter.Not many teams win this way, but the Orioles don\'t want to hear it.""Our guys don\'t dwell on conventionality. We don\'t always follow a script,"" Showalter said. ""Starters have to go seven innings every night? Who says you do?Baltimore opens the second half Friday night in Tampa Bay before heading to New York for four games against the Yankees. The Orioles were 33-14 at home and 18-22 on the road before the break.""It\'s obvious what\'s ahead of us,"" Showalter said.

At this point after 38 games and going 27-for-27 in save opportunities, Britton has an amazing ERA of 0.72 in 37.2 innings. His WHIP stands at 0.823. All of this explains why he was the last guy on the mound at the end of the All-Star Game.Over the past three years, Britton is 9-4 with a 1.55 ERA and WHIP of 0.918 \xe2\x80\xa6 all of this over a total of 180 innings. Add to this 184 strikeouts. Simply fantastic numbers!But how do these statistics compare with the very best relievers in the past couple of years? Or, beyond that, how does it compare to the ultimate closer \xe2\x80\x93 Mariano Rivera?To make this comparison work, let us start with projecting Britton\xe2\x80\x99s numbers over the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first 87 games into a full 162-game season. This will bring him to a total of 70 innings pitched with 50 saves. In the chart below, he is on the top line (Brit 16).The top saves leader in the National League just last year was Mark Melancon (Mel 15) of the Pirates. He totaled 50 saves, which is equal to Britton\xe2\x80\x99s projections. But note the higher ERA of 2.23 and fewer strikeouts.Next let us compare to the fantastic seasons of 2013 and 2014 for Greg Holland of the Royals (GH 13, GH 14). The ERA is a bit higher than Britton\xe2\x80\x99s projections, along with the WHIP just slightly more, but the greater number of strikeouts for similar innings is remarkable.Greg Kimbrell had a number of recent outstanding seasons for the Atlanta Braves, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll look at two of them from 2012 and 2013 (GK 12, GK 13). The strikeouts per innings pitched are even better than the numbers for Holland, and all the other stats are in a similar range as Britton\xe2\x80\x99s projection.The greatest of them all is Mariano Rivera. The 13-time All-Star pitched in 19 seasons and registered a total of 652 career saves. Standing out among his statistics is the incredible consistency for year after year. For comparison\xe2\x80\x99s sake, I selected the year he had his highest number of saves (MR 04) and the season where he had his lowest total earned run average (MR 08). His strikeout numbers are not really higher than Britton\xe2\x80\x99s, though the ERA is higher than what Zach would have if he can maintain the 0.72 number over the whole season.Putting all of this on a graph \xe2\x80\xa6Name/YrERAIPSVWHIPSOBrit 160.7270500.82380Mel 152.2378510.98262GH 131.2167470.866103GH 141.4462.1460.91490CK 121.0162.2420.654116CK 131.2167500.88198MR 041.9478.2531.08166MR 081.4070.2390.66577\xc2\xa0Conclusion: Zach Britton is having a rare season of excellence, especially considering the very low ERA. It can be seen from the relatively modest strikeout numbers (relative to some of the other top relievers) that he induces more poor contact than that he simply blows batters away. And this was true of Rivera as well.

07/15/2016,"[('Orioles trade target: Jeremy Hellickson - Camden Chat', ' The second half of the season starts tomorrow, and somehow the O\xe2\x80\x99s are still in first place. They\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to do this despite having a starting rotation that has been catastrophically bad - Orioles starters have the 3rd worst ERA in baseball (5.15), the 2nd worst WHIP (1.48), and have thrown the fewest innings in the majors.    It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine the Birds continuing to stay atop the division if the rotation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get better, and there don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be any good young pitchers waiting in the wings to help make that happen. If the rotation is going to improve, it\xe2\x80\x99ll probably have to improve via trade.  It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too difficult to go out and pick up a starter if the Orioles had the Dodgers\xe2\x80\x99 or the Astros\xe2\x80\x99 farm system, but unfortunately the Orioles have the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 farm system. That would be an issue in any season, but it\xe2\x80\x99s especially problematic this year when good, available starters are few and far between. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get these out of the way: the O\xe2\x80\x99s aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to get Julio Teheran or Sonny Gray. The ship has sailed on Drew Pomeranz, and they were never going to get him anyway. Someone will pay a premium for Rich Hill - despite his track record and age, the guy has a 2.25 ERA. The two years and $27 million left on Ervin Santana\xe2\x80\x99s contract might be a problem for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, but won\xe2\x80\x99t be an issue for a contender with deeper pockets. Matt Moore might be traded, but probably not to a division rival. The list goes on and on.    Moving past the names above, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take long to get into a list of pitchers who frankly aren\xe2\x80\x99t very good. Do we really want the Orioles to give up anything of value for Hector Santiago\xe2\x80\x99s 4.58 ERA and 5.14 FIP, or a sub-replacement level Andrew Cashner? No, thanks.    One pitcher, though, seems like he could strike the perfect balance between being gettable and being actually worth acquiring. That pitcher is Jeremy Hellickson. Coming into the 2016 season, Hellickson was struggling. After two excellent 2011-12 seasons in Tampa where he posted ERAs of 2.95 and 3.10, Hellickson took a nosedive. He finished with ERAs of 5.17, 4.52, and 4.62 in 2013-15 respectively, and was picked up by Philly this year on a one-year deal.    The 29-year-old righty was getting similar results in 2016 until the past few weeks. Hellickson has allowed one run apiece in each of his last three starts, and he\xe2\x80\x99s lowered his season ERA to 3.92. After the last couple years it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to write this off as just a hot streak, but there\xe2\x80\x99s reason to think his performance is legit. Hellickson is striking out more batters (and walking less) than ever before, and his HR/FB and BABIP are right around where they were last year so it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if he\xe2\x80\x99s been getting lucky. In fact, if anything, there\xe2\x80\x99s reason to believe that three-year run from 2013-2015 was unlucky. Amazingly, his two worst seasons in terms of FIP and xFIP out of the last five were actually those two great years in 2011 and 2012. Since then, his peripherals have actually improved, with an xFIP hovering around 4.10 even though his ERAs have been considerably higher.    If Hellickson is moved, he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t command a huge price in the trade market because he\xe2\x80\x99s just a rental. Some teams might be concerned about his track record prior to this season. That\xe2\x80\x99s a real \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x9d, though, because the Phillies have a few reasons they might want to keep him. First of all, the way he\xe2\x80\x99s pitching he may be a candidate for a qualifying offer. If the Phillies feel that a first-round pick is more valuable than whatever they\xe2\x80\x99d be getting in a trade, it would make sense to hang onto him.  Philadelphia is also a team that has their eye on competing soon, as their prospects like J.P. Crawford graduate to the majors. Considering their payroll is about $60 million less than last season (how is that even possible?), they can afford to throw $17 million or so in Hellickson\xe2\x80\x99s direction. It won\xe2\x80\x99t cripple them if he takes it. If the Phillies really are trying to move Hellickson, the Orioles should go after him. They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get a top-of-the-market starter, and most other starters aren\xe2\x80\x99t worth acquiring. Jeremy Hellickson is one of the few guys who is not only obtainable but would also be a big improvement to the rotation.     ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Bundy the Victor of Circumstance', 'With the Baltimore Orioles in need of starting Pitching, Is Dylan Bundy the answers to the starting rotation?The Baltimore Orioles have announced that Dylan Bundy will receive the starting nod for Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s start again the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. I wrote an article preseason in regards to Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s future being held in his own hands and it seems that due to his performance and the state of the starting rotation, Bundy will receive his shot ahead of schedule.Dylan Bundy has pitched 38 innings this year carrying an ERA of 3.08 with 32 Strike Outs. Considering he\xe2\x80\x99s been part of the bullpen could those numbers be better?\xe2\x80\xa6possibly but his last outing was his most impressive. On July 6th Bundy struck out 7 Dodgers in the 2.1 innings he pitched and although he walked two and allowed 3 hits, he looked awfully strong.Due to his injury plagued career and lack of work, there\xe2\x80\x99s speculation that starting him this early could have potentially negative effects on Dylan\xe2\x80\x99s health and development. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that concerned. It\xe2\x80\x99s most likely Buck will only allow him to go 5 innings and make sure all the right eyes are constantly evaluating his mechanics. I feel confident saying I doubt any bill effects will be caused, in fact, the most likely effect will be a major boost in the 23 yr olds confidence.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireSo now let\xe2\x80\x99s presume that the Bundy decision works out to the Orioles benefit, they\xe2\x80\x99re still left with a massive hole in the starting rotation. Although Chris Tillman has been performing extremely well, leading all SP\xe2\x80\x99s with 12 Wins and a 3.41 ERA, everyone else has underperformed. Kevin Gausman  has yet to start pitching to his ability, although he has had his moments, and Yovani Gallardo  has been up, down, and injured.The Orioles need a strong starting pitcher. Dan Duquette has made it clear that the Orioles plan on making a strong push towards acquiring a starting pitcher but there\xe2\x80\x99s not much available on the market, especially since Drew Pomeranz was dealt to our rivals, the Boston Red Sox. So what options does that leave for the Orioles when there are still 14-15 teams vying for 2 or 3 available starters.There\xe2\x80\x99s the possibility that the Diamondbacks may be willing to deal Robbie Ray and there\xe2\x80\x99s been plenty of talks about the Phillies shopping Jeremy Hellickson. I feel both pitchers would fit well in the Orioles organization and they both have a lot of upside if Baltimore has the trade tips available to make an acquisition. The worst case scenario is sending Mark Trumbo away to gain an arm, the most likely case is bargaining Trey Mancini, Christian Walker and Chris Lee, who has had a strong start to 2016 with a 5-0 record and maintaining a 2.98 ERA in 51.1 Innings Pitched.

Although they sit a top the AL Central at 52-36, they won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to keep Detroit and Chicago down for long with just a strong Starting Rotation. Tyler Naquin has been a pleasant surprise for them but he\xe2\x80\x99s the bulk of the power they have in the outfield with merely 9 HRs. They need an power outfielder that\xe2\x80\x99s going to hit for more than just average.I feel Walker could help provide some of this power and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too difficult to transition Mancini into the outfield and/or rotate with Mike Napoli at first and DH. Knowing that Cleveland isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to give up a Carlos Carrasco  or Danny Salazar, who does that leave available? How about Shawn Morimando . Although he has only pitched in one Major League game this year he has accumulated a 10-4 record between AA & AAA, carrying a 3.25 ERA with 76 Strike Outs. He is Major League ready with nowhere to put him.

I really hope we do t have to give up an essential piece of our success like Mark Trumbo but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see. In any case, congratulations to Dylan Bundy, he\xe2\x80\x99s earned an early start.

07/16/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Short Start Wins Again', 'Jul 9, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles second baseman Jonathan Schoop (6) singles scoring shortstop Manny Machado (13) (no pictured) during the eighth inning against the Los Angeles Angels at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Baltimore Orioles defeated Los Angeles Angels 3-2. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles once again had a starter go only five innings but also once again were able to hang around and win the game on a home run.Yovani Gallardo, despite 58 pitches in the first two innings, held the Rays to only three runs. The Orioles would scratch and claw long enough to tie the game, eventually winning it on a Jonathan Schoop home run and the strength of the bullpen.Reliever Mychal Givens registered his seventh win of the season, doing so after only a total of 41.1 innings pitched. This breaks a two-way tie between he and fellow reliever Brad Brach for the second-most number of wins on the team behind the 12 of Chris Tillman.That last sentence is weird! What kind of team has relief pitchers registering the second-most and third-most number of wins? Certainly not a winning team! Certainly not a first-place team! Certainly yes! The winning combination for the Orioles this year has been overcoming less-than-stellar starts and outscoring the opponents in the second half of the ballgame. It worked again!The question is: How long can this continue? It would not seem to be a winning plan. If \xe2\x80\x9cstupid is as stupid does,\xe2\x80\x9d then \xe2\x80\x9cwinning is as winning does.\xe2\x80\x9dHelping the Orioles accomplish the unusual is of course the outstanding power the team possesses, including Jonathan Schoop whose homer was the tie-breaker and game-winner. It was the 14th round-tripper of the season for the O\xe2\x80\x99s second baseman.Be it far from me to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI told you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But, I told you so \xe2\x80\xa6 that Schoop was going to have a breakout season. Quoting from our preseason article on Jonathan, we wrote \xe2\x80\xa6I am anticipating a big breakout season, believing that he is approaching the time where accumulated experience meets with rare skills at the peak age of life. He just needs to stay healthy and not have something like a blown-out knee happen on a take-out slide. I will go so far as to predict that, given a full and healthy year, Schoop will be at worst third on this team in total home runs.Actually he is fifth on the team in long balls, behind Trumbo (28), Davis (22), Jones (19) and Machado (17). But it ain\xe2\x80\x99t over yet.The better statistical improvement for Schoop is in the area of batting average and OBP. Getting his 100th hit of the season with the home run, he is now hitting .303 with a .337 OBP.In the preseason article referenced above, an extensive conversation was included about where Schoop ranked among second basemen, taking off on an article by FanGraphs that had this position for the Orioles as #22 in all of baseball. That is simply ludicrous! Even before this season began, that is crazy talk. That article spoke much about Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s lack of plate discipline, citing his 10-to-1 strikeout to walk ratio (which he has cut in half this year). And the article projected that Schoop would likely have a regressive year. So much for sabremetrics!Having also written here on The Baltimore Wire a few days ago that nothing especially good for the regular season comes out of All-Star Games for those who participate, I was worried that the sushi-induced food poisoning of Matt Wieters and Zach Britton would cause a second-half opening-game setback for the Birds. Fortunately they gutted their way through it (pun intended). And Trumbo had two hits after his silver medal home run derby placement. Brad Brach and Manny looked decent as well.

J.J. Hardy's two-run homer in the second inning was enough for the Orioles (53-36)  who have won six of seven. The Rays (34-56) are at the other extreme  having lost eight in a row  12 of 13 and 24 of 27 -- the last is the worst stretch by any American League team since 2003.

He bashed 95 homers for the Angels in his first three full seasons, but he also struck out a lot and had only a .299 on-base percentage.

The Mariners needed salary relief and cleared Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s $9.15 million. For Baltimore, though, he was a steal.

But for me personally, bouncing around a few times, you\xe2\x80\x99d like to find a home at some point and stay there and be a contributor. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping that\xe2\x80\x99s the case here. So far, so good.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles ranked ninth in the majors in runs last season, when they were .500. They are now in first place in the American League East, and they ranked fifth in runs before the All-Star break. Manny Machado, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 star third baseman, gave Trumbo much of the credit, and not just for his power.\xe2\x80\x9cHe makes everybody better,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe talk about hitting more often in the dugout. He keeps people going. If he misses a pitch or a guy\xe2\x80\x99s doing something, he picks it up, and we\xe2\x80\x99re helping each other out. He\xe2\x80\x99s done it all year. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have one of the best lineups in the league.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Catcher Matt Wieters said he had always found it tricky to make a game plan against Trumbo, who has a more compact swing than most sluggers.

A lot of pitchers try to go places that normally, to a big guy with long arms, you can get in on \xe2\x80\x94 and you can\xe2\x80\x99t get in on him.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cAlso, for a big, strong guy, he has one of the most advanced hitting approaches I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, as far as how much he thinks about the game and how much he thinks about what the pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s going to do to him.\xe2\x80\x9dTrumbo said playing for a team built on power had helped reinforce the mind-set of driving the ball. But for all of his numbers \xe2\x80\x94 he also had a career-best .923 on-base plus slugging percentage and a major-league-leading 202 total bases at the break \xe2\x80\x94 Trumbo said the opportunity mattered most.\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing I\xe2\x80\x99m most grateful for this year is, I\xe2\x80\x99ve played in every single game, and as a player that\xe2\x80\x99s all you can ask for,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou need those at-bats to be able to put up numbers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Finding a New PitchThe case of Drew Pomeranz, who was traded from San Diego to Boston on Thursday, shows just how quickly a pitcher can transform himself by paying attention while playing catch.

He was then dealt three times in the next five years: to Colorado for Ubaldo Jimenez in August 2011, to Oakland for Brett Anderson in December 2013 and to San Diego for Yonder Alonso in December (with other players in each deal).\xe2\x80\x9cI got to be around a lot of different people, a lot of great players,\xe2\x80\x9d Pomeranz said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I learned a lot from them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The player he may have learned the most from, though, was Travis Higgs, a former minor league catcher who played catch with Pomeranz in the winter at the University of San Francisco. Pomeranz had always thrown fastballs and curveballs, but he could never find a consistent third pitch. Then Higgs accidentally let loose a throw that acted like a cutter.

Pomeranz threw cutters with 12.8 percent of his pitches for San Diego, according to FanGraphs, and significantly raised his rate of curveballs to 39.2 percent. With a more complete arsenal \xe2\x80\x94 and far fewer fastballs \xe2\x80\x94 he has taken advantage of the chance he sought this spring, after spending most of last season in Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen.

""I had a good fastball but the command of it wasn\'t what I wanted it to be, and they took advantage of it.""Bundy, the fourth overall pick in the 2011 draft, has thrown 38 innings in 22 relief appearances this season.

Now let me be clear; Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s a young pitcher with a lot of potential, and he will improve. However Tampa hitters seemed to know which pitch was coming (and where) before even Bundy did.So if there\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing to say about yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s start, it would be that Bundy needs to mix his pitches better. Predictability in a pitcher isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good thing, and the Orioles suffered at the hands of Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s predictability yesterday. Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s line: 3.1 IP, 5 H, 4 R, 3 BB, 4 K.

However the home run parade for Tampa started immediately. Longoria smacked a solo homer in the last of the first, which I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure has landed yet.

For good measure, Longoria smacked his second homer of the game in the last of the eighth to run the final score to 5-2. \xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerIronically Bundy was putting the ball pretty much where he wanted to, which speaks to the fact that he needs to mix his pitches better. He addressed this after the game (quote courtesy of Roch Kubatko, MASNsports):They were pretty much where I wanted them. Arcia, that ball was off the plate and he was able to go get it. These guys are good hitters up here and we\xe2\x80\x99ve just got to be able to make better pitches.And there\xe2\x80\x99s little doubt that Bundy will get the job done in terms of finding ways to utilize more off-speed pitches in games. This also shows the difference between starting and relieving. When you\xe2\x80\x99re the starter, you have to set the tone for the game. Often times as a reliever, you\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to record outs as quickly and efficiently as you can \xe2\x80\x93 hence throwing lots of fastballs.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles reverse roles in Chris Tillman's winAfter taking two-of-three in Tampa, the Birds will now head to the Bronx to open up a four-game set with New York.\xc2\xa0Kevin Gausman will get the start for the Orioles, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by NY\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Ivan Nova.

Tillmans\xe2\x80\x99 12 wins at the time, ranked third best in the majors but apparently it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough for Tillman to earn his second All-Star selection. Tillman is only one of six players in the majors with at least 12 wins and is a huge reason why the Baltimore Orioles found themselves in first place at the midway point of the season.In his first start after the All-Star break, Tillman continued his red-hot July. On Saturday, the right-handed joined Chicago White Sox\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Sale as the only two American League pitchers with at least 13 wins. Tillman notched his 13th win after pitching seven excellent innings with three strikeouts and only yielding a run in a 2-3 win against the Tampa Bay Rays. Not only does Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s 13 wins rank second in the American League, but is also second best in the entire Major League. The Orioles ace joins San Francisco Giants Johnny Cueto and Washington Nationals Stephen Strasburg as the only 13-game winners. Following an up and down June, Tillman has tossed seven innings and an earned run in each of his July starts. The 28-year-old in three starts in July is 3-0 with a 1.29 ERA and a .169 opponent batting average. Better yet, Tillman is undefeated (6-0) in nine starts against American League East opponents tossing 54.1 innings with a 3.48 ERA. The O\xe2\x80\x99s have won all nine of those games as well.

The rest of the Orioles pitchers who have started a game this year have just a combined 28 quality starts in 70 starts. Tillman has accomplished some impressive feats so far this season that includes breaking a Baltimore Orioles all-time record on June 19th as the quickest Baltimore Orioles pitcher to 10 wins since Jimmy Key did it in 1997. Also, his 12 wins pre all-star break is Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s career best. Not only that, but the Orioles ace leads the team\xe2\x80\x99s starters in wins (12), ERA (3.41), games started (19), innings pitched (113.1), strikeouts (98), opponent batting average (.232), and WHIP (1.23). Without Tillman, the Orioles likely would not be in first place in the American League East entering the second half of the season.

Let that sink in for a moment.It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to compute, does it? Two other A.L. teams \xe2\x80\x94 the Boston Red Sox and the Kansas City Royals \xe2\x80\x94 have won the World Series in that span. Another, the Detroit Tigers, has won one A.L. Championship Series and lost another. Yet the Orioles stand atop the league since the start of 2012, with 408 victories heading into the start of a four-game series at Yankee Stadium on Monday. Yes, the time span is arbitrary. But the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 success within it says a lot.It says that they have been consistent \xe2\x80\x94 no losing records \xe2\x80\x94 but also that they have little to show for it beyond a wild-card win in 2012 and a division series victory in 2014. It also says \xe2\x80\x94 given the generally low expectations, nationally \xe2\x80\x94 that their approach may not hold widespread appeal.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not a conventional team,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Buck Showalter conceded Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe may not look, always, aesthetically pleasing in the way it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to. But it\xe2\x80\x99s about winning baseball games.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The Orioles have found ways to do that better than any of their A.L. East neighbors this season. They are 53-38, holding a slim lead over Boston with Toronto close behind. Their formula has stayed the same throughout their run: stingy relief pitching, smooth defense and thunderous offense.

You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to light the scoreboard up.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles started their lineup Monday with four players who have hit at least 15 homers this season: Adam Jones, Jonathan Schoop, Manny Machado and Mark Trumbo. Then came an All-Star catcher (Matt Wieters), a former National League home run champ (Pedro Alvarez) and a shortstop with five 20-homer seasons (J. J. Hardy). And that was without Chris Davis, a two-time major league leader in homers, who was sick.They are especially destructive late in games, though not on Monday, when the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 heralded bullpen group beat them at their own game. Dellin Betances, Andrew Miller and Aroldis Chapman stifled the Orioles in the last three innings of a 2-1 Yankees victory.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  That was an accomplishment, because the Orioles had entered Monday with 148 runs in the seventh inning or later, the most in the American League. The bullpen, which had two All-Stars in Zach Britton and Brad Brach, tends to make comebacks possible.

Only one left-hander has ever started a season with a longer streak, and he was named his league\xe2\x80\x99s most valuable player: Willie Hernandez of the 1984 Tigers. Britton cited the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 late-strike ability, and the bullpen\xe2\x80\x99s success in making those late runs matter, as reasons for the team\xe2\x80\x99s record.

The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 rotation has a 5.10 earned run average; through Sunday, its E.R.A. ranked ahead of only Minnesota and Cincinnati, two of the majors\xe2\x80\x99 worst teams. (The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen E.R.A. is 3.03.)\xe2\x80\x9cTillman\xe2\x80\x99s really stabilized our rotation, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been a tough thing to ask from him, to really have to be on top of his game every time out,\xe2\x80\x9d Britton said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think about the pressure he\xe2\x80\x99s got, every time he takes the ball, and he\xe2\x80\x99s done a great job.\xe2\x80\x9dTillman, who starts the series finale on Thursday, is 13-2 with a 3.29 E.R.A. The quality start may be a low standard to meet \xe2\x80\x94 at least six innings, no more than three earned runs \xe2\x80\x94 yet in the 71 games Tillman has not started, the Orioles have managed just 24 quality starts.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  They have made changes. Dylan Bundy, the fourth overall pick in the 2011 draft, made his first career start on Sunday. Vance Worley, a veteran who has been working in long relief, starts Tuesday in place of Ubaldo Jimenez. The Orioles lavished a four-year, $50 million contract on Jimenez \xe2\x80\x94 or $1 million for each of his A.L.-leading 50 walks this season \xe2\x80\x94 that runs through 2017. Now, with a 7.38 E.R.A., he has no clear value to the team. Perhaps Worley can be an answer, but the Orioles badly need to upgrade their rotation before the Aug. 1 nonwaiver deadline.

The Orioles have been quiet so far, but their players understand the calendar.\xe2\x80\x9cWe think about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Britton said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t control it, obviously, but I think we all know what we need. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear. So you hope that we would make a move to help that out. If we do, it\xe2\x80\x99s great.

The Orioles have done that before, trading for Miller in their 2014 playoff run. Miller came from the Red Sox for Eduardo Rodriguez, who is now in Boston\xe2\x80\x99s rotation, and helped the Orioles reach the A.L.C.S.They lost four in a row to the Royals, all by one or two runs. The Royals went on to reach Game 7 of that year\xe2\x80\x99s World Series, then won their encore last fall. They, not the Orioles, are thus the model for the back-to-front pitching staff.\xe2\x80\x9cI know the Royals get a lot of credit, and deservedly so, because they won the World Series; we haven\xe2\x80\x99t done that,\xe2\x80\x9d Britton said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve been building through our bullpen for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  They have been building that way for five seasons, to be exact, with a lot of wins \xe2\x80\x94 but no pennants \xe2\x80\x94 to validate their style.

Mandatory Credit: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles lost the first of their 10 remaining games with the Yankees in New York 2-1, being shut down by the Yanks\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen.The New York Yankees enjoyed a scripted sort of win against the Orioles on Monday night. The plan is to hold down the opposition sufficiently with starters, eek out a few runs from their aging offense, and get the final three arms into the game with a lead, thus slamming the door.The Orioles played into it fully, only getting a single run off Ivan Nova in the form of a Jonathan Schoop home run. Nova has not historically pitched extraordinarily well against the Orioles. But these O\xe2\x80\x99s were only able to muster four hits in six innings, going an additional 0-for-5 with RISP, adding to the 1-for-16 from the Tampa Bay series.Scoring only nine runs in four games is simply not going to lead to many wins. And if the offense cannot hit the Yankees early in the game, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to get much at the end \xe2\x80\xa6 not even as the team in the American League with the most come-from-behind wins (29). Running into a shutdown bullpen is a taste of their own medicine.We have been expecting for several years that the Yankees are going to age-out and at long last fade away into competitive insignificance. Coming into this four-game series with a 45-46 record, the Orioles had a chance to bury them into obscurity.The New York offense really is not very good. They only managed two runs off Kevin Gausman and simply don\xe2\x80\x99t have a fierce look about them.Among American League teams, the Yankees are 11th in runs scored, 12th in batting average and home runs, and 13th in on-base percentage. But they are #1 in highest average age for hitters.But the Orioles let them have a lead going into the seventh inning, at which time the game becomes almost unfair with Dellin Betances, Andrew Miller, and Aroldis Chapman to be faced in the final three frames.

The Baltimore Orioles have dropped back-to-back contests against the fifth- and fourth-place teams in the American League East to see their division lead dwindle to just 1 1/2 games. The Orioles look to get back on track when they play the second contest of their four-game series versus the host New York Yankees on Tuesday. Baltimore had won four in a row and six of seven before it answered Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 5-2 setback to Tampa Bay with a 2-1 loss to New York, marking just its third loss to the Yankees in nine outings dating back to last season. Jonathan Schoop belted a solo homer on Monday to hit safely in 12 of 13 games this month, but he is batting just .226 in his career versus New York and 1-for-5 against Tuesday starter Nathan Eovaldi. Carlos Beltran continued his torrid stretch with three hits in the series opener to improve to 11-for-27 with four RBIs in his last six games. The veteran is batting .303 on the season with 19 homers, but is just 3-for-12 versus Tuesday starter Vance Worley. TV: 7:05 p.m. ET, MASN (Baltimore), YES (New York) PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Vance Worley (2-0, 2.87 ERA) vs. Yankees RH Nathan Eovaldi (7-6, 5.11) After tossing 1 2/3 innings of relief on Sunday, Worley will make the spot start two nights later versus New York. The 28-year-old didn\xe2\x80\x99t fare well in his lone encounter with the Yankees, allowing one run on three hits in two-thirds of an inning in a no-decision on June 4. Worley has two starts under his belt this season, with his longest outing lasting six innings in an 11-5 win against Texas on April 15. Eovaldi has also worked out of the bullpen of late and looks to exact revenge versus Baltimore, against which he was battered for five runs on eight hits in 5 1/3 innings in a no-decision on June 3. The 26-year-old hard-throwing right-hander has been rumored to be on the trade block, and a strong start can only help his stock. Eovaldi allowed two hits in 1 1/3 scoreless innings of relief against Boston on Friday. WALK-OFFS 1. New York DH Alex Rodriguez, who belted his 696th homer on Monday, is batting .301 in his career versus Baltimore. 2.

Mandatory Credit: Thomas B. Shea-USA TODAY SportsAs the 2016 Major League Baseball trade deadline approaches, everyone knows that the Baltimore Orioles are buyers.However, everyone also knows that the team doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of trade chips to part with.Sure, there is Trey Mancini, Christian Walker, Chance Sisco (likely the O\xe2\x80\x99s catcher of the future) and a few other position players.\xc2\xa0 But, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot to deal.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are in need of pitching, that is sure.\xc2\xa0 But, what starting pitching is available?Drew Pomeranz is already with the Boston Red Sox. That leaves the likes of Rich Hill (who would be a rental for the rest of the year), Jeremy Hellickson (also a rental), Julio Teheran (under contract through 2019, team option in 2020), Andrew Cashner (a rental), Sonny Gray (under contract for several more years), and the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers.Gray and Teheran would probably cost Jonathan Schoop, or the deal would be off. And, do the O\xe2\x80\x99s really want to go the rental avenue again? Probably not.So, I have a different thought.\xc2\xa0 Why not bolster the bullpen.Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure most people would say, why bolster an already strong bullpen?Well, if the starting pitching can get through five innings, then the game could almost be over.Options in this area would start with Andrew Miller or Aroldis Chapman. Chapman is a free agent after this year. Miller still has several years to go on this contract.But, under this situation, the team would only need the starters to go five innings. Then, they could bring in Brad Brach, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, \xe2\x80\x98said-traded for reliever,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0 and Zach Britton.Or, if the starters go six, then that is a rest day for one of these guys, as they all couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pitch every day.The Orioles have an ace already, whether people want to believe it. Chris Tillman is 13-2. He has the second most wins in the AL (behind Chris Sale), second best WAR among pitchers (behind Danny Salazar), he is 9th in the AL in ERA, 6th in AL for hits per nine inning.Kevin Gausman will get you through six innings on most days. Yovani Gallardo will keep games close through five. Vance Worley may have to be the fourth option, assuming the Dylan Bundy will have reached his innings cap for the year.But, if this idea sounds bizarre, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go far to see where it worked out.Last year\xe2\x80\x99s World Series Champions, the Kansas City Royals, used something similar. Edinson Volquez started Game 1, going six innings. The game then went to the bullpen tied, before Kelvin Herrera allowed a run in relief. But, the Royals would come back and win, with Chris Young getting the win in the 14th inning.Game 2, Johnny Cueto goes 9 innings in a 7-1 win. Nothing to say there.Game 3, Yordano Ventura goes 3.1 innings, allows five earned in a 9-3 loss.Game 4, Chris Young, who finished Game 1, goes four innings, followed by Danny Duffy, Luke Hochevar, Ryan Madson (winning pitcher), Wade Davis.Game 5, Royals win 7-2 in 12. Volquez goes six innings, then Herrera 3, Hochevar (winning pitcher) 2, Davis 1. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injurySo, Cueto goes the distance. But, the longest outing otherwise is two six inning outings from Volquez.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen this year with a healthy Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day is arguably as good and as deep as the Royals from last year. Without trading for a reliever.What the O\xe2\x80\x99s need is one starter to step up and give a quality start (6 IP, 3 ER) each start.Kevin Gausman, come on down and show us you are ready to be the pitcher the Orioles expect you to be.

Rodriguez admired its flight into the bleachers, a worthy way for him to mark the end of a drought that had lasted one month, since he homered against Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s Ricky Nolasco on June 18.It had also been some time since Rodriguez had celebrated a home run at Yankee Stadium, his last one coming more than three months ago, on April 17, against Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s Hisashi Iwakuma.

He escaped the first inning when Pedro Alvarez popped out with the bases loaded. Center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury had to run down two hard-hit balls by Matt Wieters and Ryan Flaherty, and third baseman Chase Headley neatly gloved a smash by Jonathan Schoop.

Once he gained better command of his sinker and curveball, keeping them down, he retired the final seven batters he faced.It was hard to ask for more against the team that leads baseball with 142 home runs, even if the Orioles were without first baseman Chris Davis, who was ill.

Mandatory Credit: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles, in spite of their well-known starting pitching woes, have had recent problems that are actually worse on the offensives side of the game.It is almost as if the offensive switch for the team has somehow slipped into the \xe2\x80\x9coff\xe2\x80\x9d position. It is a curious thing to see, having so often seen just the opposite.We have known all along that this was going to be a streaky team. That is the nature of a squad that is built upon power, possessing also the proclivity to strike out quite a bit.We knew also that good pitching was going to some days put quite a damper on the fire of the O\xe2\x80\x99s powerful lineup. Not to take anything away from the five pitchers of the Rays and Yankees that the Birds have seen since the ASG break, that have not been that incredible. Baltimore is simply not hitting the baseball.The big concern (that is a reality) is that the Orioles are in greatest peril because of pitching rotation woes. But even if the O\xe2\x80\x99s traded away every talent in the franchise\xe2\x80\x99s minor leagues to secure, say, the two best starters available before the trade deadline, it will not matter if the offense is going to score only 10 runs per five games.Consider some of these other statistics: Since the break, the Orioles have gone 31-for-161 at the plate. That is an average of .193. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryWorse than that is the average with runners in scoring position.

And it will. The Orioles have hit in the past and they will hit in the future. The challenge for the remaining season is to hit and pitch well enough to get into the playoffs, hoping also that October will be one of those seasons when the offense is collectively hitting ball. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Getting NY back on track - Birds Watcher', 'The Baltimore Orioles are seemingly helping New York up a bit if the first two games of four mean anything.While it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not intentional, the Baltimore Orioles have in essence offered a glimmer of hope to their rivals in the Bronx in the first two games of four this week. On Sunday night when NY played Boston, ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s crew was very careful to say that decisions were being made as they spoke as to whether New York was going to buy or sell at the deadline. New York of course won that game, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the first two from the first place O\xe2\x80\x99s.So again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if the Birds are trying to help New York. But if the word on the street happened to be that NY was going to sell, you have to wonder if that isn\xe2\x80\x99t starting to change. If they look at the standings and see that they\xe2\x80\x99re now only 6.5 games out of first\xe2\x80\xa6you never know, right? And that\xe2\x80\x99s all the Orioles really need; a New York team that suddenly becomes an underdog story and captures the attention of the nation as they come out of nowhere to get to the postseason.Vance Worley was ineffective as a starter last night, although it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to win when you only put up one run as a team. Worley\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.1 IP, 3 H, 3 R, 4 BB, 3 K. He gave up a two-run homer to Castro in the second, and he was also responsible for the run that scored in the fifth on Ellsbury\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single.\xc2\xa0Live Feed vance worleyBaltimore Orioles interested in Vance Worley reunion The Baltimore WireDetroit Tigers: Recently-Released Players Worth Taking a Flier on Motor City BengalsWashington Nationals: Vance Worley Could Provide Much Needed Rotation Depth District on DeckChicago Cubs: Potential suitors for vacant rotation spots Cubbies CribDetroit Tigers: Five Non-Tendered Players Who Are Potential Fits Motor City BengalsBaltimore Orioles Acquire Former Rule Five Pick Logan Verrett The Baltimore WireThe O\xe2\x80\x99s tried to put up somewhat of a fight when Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double cut it to 3-1 in the sixth. However that rally was over in a New York minute. Castro smacked a two-RBI double in the last of the inning, and Headley a two-run homer in the last of the eighth.So the question is whether or not New York still views themselves as sellers as the deadline aproaches. One would hope that no team would be compulsive enough to allow a couple of games to influence their thinking.

Game time is set for just after 7 PM. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles Prospects: A glance at several unknown superstars ...', ' Much has been made about the talent drought in the current state of the Orioles system, and rightfully so. As we sit in the middle of the 2016 season, the lack of top prospects within the Birds organization is more than evident.     It dominates the O\xe2\x80\x99s minor-league storylines and tends to blind views of favorable storylines that pop up every night.  Is the farm system in Baltimore as rich as its ever been? Hardly. But at the end of the day, that simple fact sets up \xe2\x80\x9cdiamond in the rough\xe2\x80\x9d situations throughout the organization - opportunities for young unknowns to burst onto the scene.  And thus far in 2016, plenty of firepower has emerged for at-least a second look.     Aderlin Rodriguez - Frederick When the Mets released Rodriguez at the end of last season, they were likely fairly convinced that the end of his road would be near. From 2012-2014, he was a middle-of-the-pack hitter with power potential and errors aplenty at the corner infield slots. Bottom line, he had appeared to be maxed out.     But don\xe2\x80\x99t tell that to the 2016 version of Aderlin Rodriguez. Whatever he\xe2\x80\x99s done since entering the Orioles organization, it\xe2\x80\x99s been working. Over 89 games with Frederick, Rodriguez is hitting .314 with a .911 OPS.  He\xe2\x80\x99s combined for 41 extra-base hits, including 18 doubles and 17 round-trippers. His strikeout rate is slightly high at 23-percent, but in the grand totality of his game, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a terrible concern.     He\xe2\x80\x99s primarily locking down first base for Frederick, but he\xe2\x80\x99s played 90 innings at the hot corner where he has plenty of experience from his time with the Mets.  And while the makeup of the Orioles system doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly bode well for his future with the Orioles, certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t count the 24-year-old out of future trade discussions.  Cole Billingsley - Aberdeen It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit odd to talk about a successful outfielder in the Orioles system, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Luckily, Billingsley is proving that trends are meant to be broken ... well, at-least through the first 73 at-bats of his first steps in pro ball.     The former South Alabama standout is crushing opposing pitching this season, starting with a .329/.417/.521 trio. Drafted in the 16th round last month, the 22-year-old Ironbird is already finding a way to make it work in the pros.  Sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s early and it\xe2\x80\x99s short-season single A baseball, but why not celebrate a non-catcher/first baseman doing big things at the dish in the system?  What\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging about Billingsley is the sheer potential that could lie ahead. He hit .302 in 2013 before sitting out his entire sophomore season as a medical redshirt. In 2015, he exploded with a .345 average, .437 OBP and 30 stolen bases (which he does have three of in his first 20 games in Aberdeen).  If he follows the path he\xe2\x80\x99s been sprinting since graduating high-school, the former Team USA 16U star might just find his way onto 2017\xe2\x80\x99s top minor-league prospect watch list.  Yermin Mercedes - Delmarva Mercedes is a catcher, which might put him in a difficult position to climb up the ladder moving forward. However, his 2016 numbers are simply too impressive to ignore   - perhaps for other teams around the league.     After spending 2011-2013 in the Dominican Summer League, Mercedes emerged onto the scene last season with a very respectable year in Delmarva. He hit .272 with eight home runs in 64 games, working a total .456 slugging percentage. Not bad, but not nearly close to the totals he\xe2\x80\x99s collected this campaign.  Through 82 games, Mercedes is absolutely crushing the baseball with a .352 average and .558 slugging percentage. He\xe2\x80\x99s getting on base 40 percent of the time as a staple of the middle of Delmarva\xe2\x80\x99s lineup, hitting 11 home runs with 53 RBI in the process.  His .390 average against left-handers is just one more reason why he\xe2\x80\x99s become the clear contender for Orioles minor-leaguer of the year. And depending on what he looks like behind the dish, Mercedes could eventually emerge as a premier prize in a future trade situation.  Next Wednesday, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go over three surprise arms toeing the rubber in the 2016 Orioles system.   ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Although it seems easy, closing a glove around a baseball is sometimes harder than it looks.Case in point: Thursday afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game at Yankee Stadium. On three occasions, Yankees infielders failed to secure a ball, and each time, the defensive miscue led to a run. As a result, the Yankees were unable to complete a four-game sweep of the Baltimore Orioles, falling by 4-1.C. C. Sabathia pitched well on his 36th birthday, but he was foiled by soft base hits. Sabathia tossed six and two-thirds innings, allowing two runs in the first inning and two more in the seventh.\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he gave us a gritty performance today \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Joe Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up a lot of hard-hit balls, and you look up and there\xe2\x80\x99s four runs on the board.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 initial hit came when Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius did not cleanly scoop a slow roller off the bat of Jonathon Schoop in the first inning. The Orioles eventually loaded the bases for J. J. Hardy, who hit a sharp line drive that deflected off the top of Gregorius\xe2\x80\x99s mitt and fell into left field, bringing home two runs.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Sabathia allowed only one hit over his next five innings before allowing back-to-back one-out singles in the seventh. That brought up Schoop again, and he doubled to right, easily scoring Caleb Joseph. Right fielder Carlos Beltran fired the ball to Mark Teixeira at first base as Julio Borbon rounded third, but Teixeira dropped the throw, and Borbon scored.Despite having his bullpen ready, Girardi chose to stay with Sabathia in the seventh. After the game, Girardi repeatedly defended his decision, pointing to Sabathia\xe2\x80\x99s previous success against Schoop, who was 3 for 13 until that point against him.\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re probably extremely frustrated, because when you\xe2\x80\x99re not giving up hard contact, you\xe2\x80\x99re making good pitches, and it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating for him and for us that they\xe2\x80\x99re turning into base hits,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said, adding about the Schoop at-bat, \xe2\x80\x9cYou look at the base hit, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hit hard, it was just extremely well placed.\xe2\x80\x9d Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

On Wednesday, Manager Buck Showalter, first baseman Chris Davis and third baseman Manny Machado were absent from the game because of flulike symptoms that have spread through the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse.The bug reportedly originated at the All-Star Game in San Diego last week, infecting catcher Matt Wieters and reliever Zach Britton.

I think Hart\xe2\x80\x99s ability to get out lefties is valuable on this team, and he has pitched effectively since being called up. But, if the team opts to hold on to Ubaldo, I think Hart will get sent down.Now, for the offense. Hopefully getting back home will allow everyone to get healthy, as Chris Davis, Manny Machado, Matt Wieters, Zach Britton, Buck Showalter and others have battled a virus since the All-Star Game.A lot of clamoring called for Caleb Joseph to be sent down, but let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, we all know he can hit better than he has so far.\xc2\xa0 He is better than a .188 hitter, although he may be the kind of guy who needs regular playing time.\xc2\xa0 In that way, maybe having Pena in the majors would be more effective.

07/23/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Ubaldo Jimenez Trade Discussions', 'Jun 7, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez (31) is congratulated by first baseman Chris Davis (19) after being taken out of the game in the fifth inning against the Kansas City Royals at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles won 9-1. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have been reported over the past 24 hours to be in possible trade discussions with the San Diego Padres involving Ubaldo Jimenez.The obvious problem for the Orioles right now is that they are getting zero bang for the buck from the $13 million hole in the rotation. The guy has not seen the pitching mound in two weeks. In other news, the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching staff has had an ERA under 3.00 since that time. Probably just a coincidence.So why would the Padres want to have the maestro of moving parts? By trading back Melvin Upton and his even larger salary for this year and next, they save a few million dollars. They are also seeking a prospect from the O\xe2\x80\x99s.Without the prospect, I\xe2\x80\x99d do this deal every day and three times on Sunday. With a prospect included? Well, it depends who the prospect is, but I\xe2\x80\x99d work hard to make it happen.Joey Rickard is out four to six weeks, and he is the best backup for Adam Jones and his quirky back. The Orioles also lost their only speed threat in Rickard, though Julio Borbon provides that at this point. But Upton can fly, especially by Baltimore standards. He has swiped 20 bases this year (7th best in MLB), whereas the entire Orioles team has only 13!\xc2\xa0 Consider this: there are 19 players in MLB who have more SBs individually than does the O\xe2\x80\x99s team.Upton is currently batting .259 in 91 games with 16 home runs. He does strike out a good bit, but we\xe2\x80\x99re used to that.So where does Hyun Soo Kim fit with this? Probably at DH with Upton in left field and Trumbo in right. Pedro Alvarez would be the one to lose the most.Thinking longer-term, the Orioles are probably not going to be able to afford to keep Trumbo next year, so this covers for a bit of that loss, while also not having to have Jimenez around again.There is more news this morning of a second discussion with the Padres \xe2\x80\xa6Source: #Orioles pursuing #Padres\xe2\x80\x99 Cashner in addition to Upton. Separate deals.\xe2\x80\x94 Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) July 23, 2016So how does this fit with the discussion above? Rosenthal says \xe2\x80\xa6Upton deal with #Orioles would be Upton-for-Ubaldo with #Padres also seeking prospect. SD wants two prospects for Cashner, sources say.\xe2\x80\x94 Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) July 23, 2016Please! NO! No matter how many writers out there say that this is a certain upgrade for the Orioles, the numbers simply do not prove it \xe2\x80\xa6 especially this year. Baltimore needs pitchers who can go deeper into games, right? Well, Andrew Cashner has made 15 starts this year and thrown 73.1 innings \xe2\x80\xa6 less than five innings per start. His ERA is 4.79. Last year it was 4.43.\xc2\xa0 His WHIP number for the two years are 1.425 \xe2\x80\xa6 in San Diego.Indeed, his stats in 2012 and 2013 were very good. If that is the pitcher who would come to Baltimore, then maybe it could be thought about. But for two prospects?

Cashner for anything?\xe2\x80\xa6 run the other way. These veteran pitcher \xe2\x80\x9cdeals\xe2\x80\x9d tend to not work out, kill the rotation, and create road blocks for rising prospects to get experience and opportunity.

There was one more he wanted to show, snapping back into a right-handed setup, spreading his legs wide and lowering the bat toward his belt buckle with a fearsome scowl: Jay Buhner.Frazier is putting up offensive numbers this season that would rival any of those former sluggers. But Frazier\xe2\x80\x99s own batting stance, while technically sound and often effective, is not nearly as memorable as the ones he enthusiastically mimicked.So it is in baseball today, where personalization at the plate appears headed the way of bullpen cars and scorecards, disappearing from a game that it once spiced. Batting stances used to identify hitters as vividly as their uniform numbers \xe2\x80\x94 and, sometimes, there was a good reason for that. Stan Musial used to be so coiled in the box that fans watching on television saw more of the No. 6 on Musial\xe2\x80\x99s back than of the tan on his face. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      But in an age of advanced metrics, enhanced video and intensified coaching, the idiosyncrasies have been pretty much ironed out of the game. There is no Musial, and there is no Julio Franco, who aimed his bat at the pitcher from over his head before unwinding with tornadic gusto as the pitch approached. Nor is there a Phil Plantier, who crouched as a terrified Little Leaguer might when facing a fastball up and in.                     Quiz: Name That Batting Stance                              We asked former big leaguers Sean Casey and Cliff Floyd to impersonate their favorite batting stances. Can you match the stance (and swing) to the player?                        And nor is there anyone like Gary Sheffield, arms violently flapping like windshield wipers in a torrential downpour. Or Moises Alou, legs splayed but knees connected as if magnetically paired, a contortion exhibition at each plate appearance.Instead, a conspicuous sameness has befallen the batter\xe2\x80\x99s boxes of the big leagues. The top stars of today\xe2\x80\x99s era take stances that are essentially alike. Hitting experts say that the prevailing stance these days is near the plate, slightly open, hands raised \xe2\x80\x94 a simple, streamlined model of efficiency. Another word for it might be boring, especially when compared with the old lineups that used to burst with individuality.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Indeed, part of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s appealing history can be traced to its diversity in those moments before the pitcher began his windup. Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner separated their hands. Duke Snider held his elbows up to his chin. There was the fidgety left arm of Joe Morgan and the rhythmic motions of Cal Ripken Jr., sliding the bat along his shoulder like the bow of a violin. Rickey Henderson leaned over the plate; Fred McGriff could hardly stand farther from it.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Some stances simply defied explanation. No hitting coach would advise trying to replicate that of the slugger Tony Batista, who hit 41 home runs for the Toronto Blue Jays in 2000 out of a stance that looked more appropriate for the ballet, beginning with his torso turned directly toward the mound and his bat dancing in front of him, tormenting the pitcher as if to say, \xe2\x80\x9cJust try to get it past me.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Ripken cycled through about a dozen disparate stances during his time with the Baltimore Orioles, a habit he developed by riffing on those he admired while growing up.

Yet it feels worse.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  A Trademark DevelopsIn the game\xe2\x80\x99s nascent years, there was no universally approved batting technique. There were no batting coaches. A defined batter\xe2\x80\x99s box did not appear until 1874. Until 1886, hitters could inform pitchers where they wanted the ball, high or low, and the incoming pitch would dictate their stance. Often, they choked way up, or gripped the bat like an ax handle, hands spread. Some waved the bat in front of their bodies, thereby disrupting the pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s aim.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very much every man to his own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter Morris, a baseball researcher. \xe2\x80\x9cThey used often vastly different types of bats, and many often made their own bat. And they used very different stances, too.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Even the gaping stance of Batista had some precedents. In \xe2\x80\x9cA Game of Inches,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris wrote that Cap Anson, whose career began in 1871, had used a similarly wide stance and ample stride. And his stance was only slightly more pronounced than that of Nap Lajoie, the Hall of Fame infielder from the turn of the last century, Morris said.Such quirks continued to define hitters as the game modernized. Stances evolved as pitchers evolved. Hitters once could drop their hands and wind up to swing, because pitchers, while deceptive, were not overpowering.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Babe Ruth and many others in the 1920s and \xe2\x80\x9930s favored a closed stance, their front foot pointed inward, away from the pitcher, partly in an effort to keep from yanking balls into foul territory. As pitching improved, so did the need for hitters to see the ball better: open stances, with the front foot pointed outward, came in vogue.But all the while, players took different approaches. Hank Greenberg kept his bat parallel to the ground. Al Simmons strode backward. Joe DiMaggio spread his stance wide enough to touch each side of the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box with his feet.

He said he spread his legs exactly 27 inches apart, his hands just below shoulder level, his lead foot slightly opened, but his stance generally closed. He believed in a compact setup, with the hands no more than eight inches from the body, which he considered a \xe2\x80\x9cstronger\xe2\x80\x9d position. He kept his bat vertical, which he said helped increase the \xe2\x80\x9cloop\xe2\x80\x9d in his swing, enabling him to put the ball in the air.Williams was ahead of his time. Today\xe2\x80\x99s hitters seem to be following the clinical approach that he laid out. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody wants to get that Point A to Point B,\xe2\x80\x9d Frazier said. \xe2\x80\x9cA, foot down, to B, hands through.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Compelled to TinkerSean Casey remembers being in spring training with the Cincinnati Reds in 2003 when a familiar voice called from the opposing dugout.

So he raised his left leg up and down in the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box to release his hips, and the motion stuck.Naturally, even fans picked up on Casey\xe2\x80\x99s odd stomp. During a game in Milwaukee, he heard people in the crowd counting in unison how many times he raised his leg.\xe2\x80\x9cIt totally got me off my game,\xe2\x80\x9d Casey said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it my next at-bat, people started booing me.\xe2\x80\x9dActually, a lot of distinct batting stances were born from necessity, guided by feel, hardened by superstition.

After fielding the bouncing ball off the backstop, Perez hit Alvarez in the helmet with the throw for an error.The Indians\' catchers often practice the throw to first after a dropped third strike, but Perez still evidently has some work to do.""I don\'t think he rushed.

07/25/2016,"[('Orioles Trade Targets: Melvin Upton Jr. and Andrew Cashner ...', ' The trade deadline is upon us and we need to brace ourselves, the unnamed sources are coming. The heaviest and hottest Orioles rumors so far have been for two San Diego Padres, Melvin Upton Jr. and Andrew Cashner.     Both are flawed and both have their own upside. Remember though, as our fearless leader loves to say, the first rule of baseball rumors is that nothing will probably happen. So, let\xe2\x80\x99s get into me writing thousands of words about moves that probably won\xe2\x80\x99t happen.  Melvin Upton Jr.  Orioles fan know Melvin from back when he went by B.J. Upton. He played on the Tampa Bay Rays for at least parts of eight seasons. He has primarily played left field for the Padres this season. He is a right  handed hitter and will turn 32 years old later this year. He is currently hitting .256/.304/.439 posting a 101 wRC+. He is owed around $7.5 million for the rest of 2016 and will be owed $16.4 million in 2017.  Upton had a bit of resurgence last season at the plate posting a 110 wRC+ for the year. He signed his big contract with the Braves after the 2012 season and was atrocious.     While in Atlanta his plate discipline eroded as did his contact skills and power. He went from an above average major leauger to below replacement level. While in San Diego, his power has reemerged and while he is still struggling to make contact, his power numbers have kept him above water.     Upton can help the current Orioles roster in three ways. First, he is an excellent base runner which the Orioles sorely lack. He has 20 stolen bases which would be seven more than the entire Orioles team. He also is an above average bases runner all around\xe2\x80\x94he has accumulated 4.2 base running runs (you can read more about that here) which would put him second on the team behind of all people Chris Davis (it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about speed). Second, Upton is an above average defender. The Orioles outfield defense is atrocious. It is the 29th ranked outfield defense according to UZR. The easiest way for the Orioles to improve their run prevention would be to improve their outfield defense.     Upton has been an above average left fielder his entire career. His overall defensive numbers are not pretty this season, but that is mostly due to a poor small sample size of 80 innings in center field. He is still an above average defender on the corners. Three, he hits for power and can hit lefties. So far in 2016, his walk rate has fallen to a career low 6.1 percent, not a great sign. However, he has a .183 isolated power number and already has 16 home runs and 11 doubles.  The Orioles have a plethora of low on base/high slugging hitter, but this isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily a bad thing for the offense adding even more fire power to the bottom of the order.     Furthermore, he hits lefties. He has a career 110 wRC+ against left handed pitching and has posted a 146 wRC+ in 2016. The Orioles could use some help against lefties. As a team they have posted a 88 wRC+ against left handed pitching this year which is tied for 25th in the league with the Rockies.  Upton is a flawed, but useful player that \x7fI believe can help the Orioles, the only question after that is what the cost will be to acquire him. The rumored deal is Upton for Ubaldo Jimenez and a \xe2\x80\x9cprospect.\xe2\x80\x9d I love a good \xe2\x80\x9cbad contract swap\xe2\x80\x9d trade.  For the Padres, this saves them some money, gives them a reclamation project they can possibly flip next season, and a lottery ticket.  For the Orioles, it gives them not what they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for\xe2\x80\x94a starting pitcher\xe2\x80\x94but it helps them in areas that can be easily improved. It will cost them about $5 million more over the course of the next season and a half and the \xe2\x80\x9cprospect.\xe2\x80\x9d  The only so called prospect the Orioles should not be giving away is Chance Sisco, otherwise I am not tied to any of them. Maybe Jomar Reyes, but otherwise the whole lot are tradeable assets. Giving up much of value for Upton is foolhardy. He is not a great player, but a useful one. He also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come cheap.     The name being floated is Tanner Scott. A flame throwing lefty reliever just promoted to AA Bowie with severe command and control problems. If the deal was Jimenez and Scott for Upton, I\xe2\x80\x99d do it. Anyone much better then Scott, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to think about it.  Andrew Cashner The other Padre the Orioles have been rumored to be after is Andrew Cashner. He is set to be a free agent, so this would be a rental deal. He is a right handed starting pitcher who has struggled the last two seasons. His ERA currently sits at 4.79 the worst mark since his rookie year.  While he struggled last year results wise pitching to a 4.34 ERA, his peripherals were still alright in 2015. He was essentially a league average pitcher who threw 180 innings, which the Orioles could use. However, in 2016 the peripheral statistics have nose dived as well.  He currently has his highest walk rate since 2012 and the lowest whiff rate of his career. Not to mention that hitters are making contact on his pitches at a career high rate as well even though they are swinging less overall at those pitches.  On top of all that, Cashner has been giving up the gopher ball at a 14.7 percent home run to fly ball rate. The highest rate he has given up home runs at since 2012.    Cashner had good results last in 2013 and 2014 for the Padres. He was able to run a low BABIP and a low HR/FB rate. Whether or not that was due to luck or skill is up to you, but for the last two years and especially in 2016 he has been the same pitcher.  A lot of teams are in on the Cashner sweepstakes at this point. On top of the Orioles, the Giants, Tigers, Rangers, Marlins, and Astros have all been connected to Cashner. The reported asking price from the Orioles is \xe2\x80\x9ctwo prospects.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ah, there are those magical words again. For a half season rental of a soon to be 30 year old right handed pitcher the price cannot be all that high. However, if the Orioles are competing with that many teams, they will quickly be outmatched in terms of buying power.  I am a little hazy on why Cashner is so desirable. His three most predominate traits are that he has an arm attached to his torso, that arm can throw the ball sixty feet six inches, and he is currently breathing. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten good results since 2014 and those results are dubious.  Cashner isn\xe2\x80\x99t even an innings eater as he never thrown above 200 innings in a year and has only gone over 175 innings once. The Orioles could use all the help they could get in the rotation and if the price is low enough then Cashner makes some sense, but I am not convinced he is worth getting into a bidding war over.     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*** The Orioles are in first place and are looking to add, with a weakened farm system they are going to have to get creative. I would bet on the Orioles making at least one trade before the July 31st non-waiver trade deadline and at least one more before the August 31st waiver trade deadline.  Whether or not it is for either of Upton or Cashner remains to be seen. Either way, it\xe2\x80\x99s shaping up to be a fun stretch run in Baltimore.

The Baltimore Orioles are winners of four straight and have retaken the lead in the American League East. The Orioles, who host the Colorado Rockies on Monday in the opener of a three-game interleague series, seemed to turn their biggest weakness into a strength as the pitching staff came through over the last four games. Baltimore is last in the AL with 37 quality starts but recorded three of those in the last four contests, the lone exception coming when Dylan Bundy did not allow an earned run in five innings on Friday. The Orioles are 36-14 at home after allowing a total of six runs in a three-game sweep of the AL Central-leading Cleveland Indians over the weekend, capped by Nolan Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s walk-off home run on Sunday. That Baltimore staff will have to deal with streaking rookie shortstop Trevor Story, who piled up four homers and nine RBIs in a three-game sweep of the Atlanta Braves over the weekend and has six blasts in the last seven games to increase his National League-leading total to 27. Story is three home runs shy of tying Nomar Garciaparra for the rookie record of 30 homers by a shortstop. PITCHING MATCHUP: Rockies LH Jorge De La Rosa (6-7, 6.07 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Yovani Gallardo (3-2, 5.69) De La Rosa had a string of five straight quality starts come to an abrupt end when he was crushed in an interleague start against the Tampa Bay Rays on Wednesday. The Mexico native was ripped for nine runs \xe2\x80\x93 seven earned \xe2\x80\x93 on 11 hits and a pair of walks in four innings. De La Rosa fared better in his previous start against AL East competition, limiting the New York Yankees to three hits in five scoreless innings on June 14. Gallardo has gone four consecutive turns without a quality start but at least worked deeper into the game when he served up four runs in seven innings at the Yankees on Wednesday. The fellow Mexican issued 15 walks in 21 innings over those four turns and is allowing opponents a .296 batting average. Gallardo spent his first eight seasons in the NL and never managed to beat Colorado, posting a 0-5 record with a 6.08 ERA in 10 games \xe2\x80\x93 nine starts. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles C Matt Wieters (foot) missed the last six games and is day-to-day. 2. Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s top OF prospect, 22-year-old David Dahl, is expected to join the team on Monday and make his major league debut in the series. 3.

Could this continue throughout the remainder of the season?It has been largely assumed for some time that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 only chance to make the playoffs, win the division, or compete well into October was dependent upon getting at least one veteran arm for the rotation. But as we have written here on The Baltimore Wire ad infinitum, making this happen successfully is not only expensive long-term, it is fraught with historic disappointment in the product. I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner predict a cheerful, peaceful presidential campaign season than predict success from any pitching acquisition.If the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching staff can continue as they have over the past 12 games (8-4 with a 2.77 ERA), the Birds really don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be making any moves. But that is asking for and hoping for a lot \xe2\x80\xa6 probably too much. We could be happy with a 3.50 ERA, or something like that!The question is essentially whether the staff, particularly the starting rotation, has finally arrived at what we hoped they could be, or whether the previous period of struggle is the real \xe2\x80\x9cthem\xe2\x80\x9d and that this new success is the aberration.To answer the question posed by this piece, yes, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching is capable of continued high-level success. The talent is there, both from the history of veterans and the rising skills of young pitchers. But the devil is always in the details of execution of talent on the field, specifically over that space of 60\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d.It is reasonable to expect Chris Tillman to extend his good season through the end. Kevin Gausman has pitched better than his record, and we can hope he is finally arriving into a regular and dependable piece for every fifth day.Dylan Bundy looks to have \xe2\x80\x9carrived\xe2\x80\x9d also in terms of pitching ability. It was great to see back-to-back wins from Gausman and him \xe2\x80\xa6 been waiting a few years to experience that!\xc2\xa0 The issue, of course, relates to how many innings are safely available in his arm. This is an imprecise science, though I wonder if the physique and strength for which he is renowned might not position him for a higher number than is typically true of TJ-recovering pitchers.The following two pieces are the wild cards for sure: Yovani Gallardo and Vance Worley. Both have the veteran ability to work the edges and pitch out of trouble while minimizing damage. They can both get shelled from time to time as well. Like Miguel Gonzalez before them, they have to be very good at walking a fine line. It would be huge if they could do it.It is not inconceivable that Mike Wright or Tyler Wilson could put together a hot stretch and contribute well. It too would be huge! The more likely of the two is Wilson. After a 5.22 ERA in 13 starts and 16 games over 81 innings with the Orioles, he has been sent down for a sort of \xe2\x80\x9cre-set\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cre-start.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The numbers are too ugly to print, though he reports feeling good, for what that\xe2\x80\x99s worth. But this is the guy who shut out the Red Sox over eight innings on June 16th.Mike Wright has had a strange season. His 2.58 ERA at AAA Norfolk is half of the 5.97 for the Orioles. We know that there is a jump from one level to the other, but not that much of a difference. And his last three starts for Norfolk have him with a combined ERA of 4.58 over 17.2 innings. Yet again, we know that talent is there, but not the consistency.Left out of this discussion so far has been Ubaldo Jimenez. And \xe2\x80\x9cleft out\xe2\x80\x9d is what he needs to continue to be. The Orioles have simply not had need of a mop-up man lately. In the 10 games since the All-Star break, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have only scored 29 runs \xe2\x80\xa6 yes, let that sink in. They have given up 30, so being 6-4 ain\xe2\x80\x99t bad. But there have been no blowout wins or losses, so no need for a \xe2\x80\x9cjust-git-r-done-and-go-home\xe2\x80\x9d pitcher. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve written in the past how I have a car I have nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cUbaldo,\xe2\x80\x9d since it was very expensive and does not work as advertised.All of this discussion so far has been about starting pitchers. What is there to say about the bullpen other than that they have been a great team strength?\xc2\xa0 And now Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day is back. A key element of the pen will be how they handle middle innings, particularly in Bundy starts, along with any others who can\xe2\x80\x99t get through six innings.While we are talking about pitching, let\xe2\x80\x99s weigh in for a moment on the trade of Aroldis Chapman from the Yankees to the Cubs for four prospects. In the short term this is good for the Orioles, who have nine games remaining with the Evil Empire, including six in NY. It is also good that the Nationals did not get him, since the O\xe2\x80\x99s have their four games yet with Washington.

The Orioles won 5-3. Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY SportsPedro Alvarez had two 90-foot trips to first base on Sunday afternoon that were critical to the scoring of three Orioles runs and a 5-3 win and series sweep over the Cleveland Indians.One day after Chris Davis hustled to first base on a double-play ball to get a run scored from third base, Pedro Alvarez did the same. The video replay proving it and overturning the call. It was good to see one of these challenges go the O\xe2\x80\x99s way.Little things make a big difference in the game of baseball, where inches and split seconds can make all of the difference. And it happened a second time later in the game.In the ninth inning, Alvarez struck out on a wild pitch, having also the presence of mind to run to first base. By shear good fortune, the throw from catcher Roberto Perez hit Pedro in the head. We could say he put his head to good use, deflecting the ball. This gave the Orioles an extra out, setting the stage for the Nolan Reimold walk-off homer off Cody Allen.This blog and its writers have been likely the most Reimold supportive of O\xe2\x80\x99s sites. But even we would have to acknowledge he has not played well in recent times. Is this homer enough to save Nolan from future moves, like, oh, what could it be? Like \xe2\x80\xa6 if the Orioles were to obtain the Upton fellow from San Diego, with Hyun Soo Kim returning as well, etc.\xc2\xa0 Reimold has already used up more than nine lives in his career with the Birds, so never count him out.The home run was the first in 56 days for Nolan and the third walk-off shot in his career. He last accomplished this on 8/10/11 against Jason Frasor and the White Sox. Prior to that he hit a game-winning walk-off as the fourth homer of his career on 5/27/09 against Brian Wolfe of the Blue Jays. It was in the bottom of the 11th with the O\xe2\x80\x99s trailing 10-9 and one out. Scoring ahead of him were Melvin Mora and Cesar Izturis (pinch running for Luke Scott).\xc2\xa0 Lots of memories there!Speaking of nine lives and returning from the dead, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day certainly acted like nothing was bothering him in his return after many weeks on the disabled list. He struck out the side in the ninth, improving to 3-1 on the season with the victory and lowering his ERA to a perfect 3.00.\xc2\xa0 Having him back and performing well with good health is definitely the addition of an extra weapon.

OK, yes, the Rangers have the same number of wins, but two more losses.

Of course he pitched well Rockies starter, and longtime Orioles trade target, Jorge De La Rosa entered Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game with a 6.07 ERA, 5.22 FIP and -0.3 WAR. The 35-year-old is not a good pitcher. But the Orioles random spurts of offensive ineptitude do not discriminate, so of course De La Rosa shut them down for most of the night They had him on the ropes early on. In the first inning, the Birds loaded the bases with one out thanks to a Jonathan Schoop double, a Nolan Arenado error and a Mark Trumbo walk. But then it was the ice cold Chris Davis who struck out followed by a Matt Wieters ground out. Like that, the threat was over and no runs where scored. In the second inning, the O\xe2\x80\x99s broke through the deadlock, but could have gotten more. J.J. Hardy led off with a walk. A batter later, Dariel Alvarez reached when Arenado airmailed a throw to first base, allowing the runners to move up to second and third. And then Adam Jones put the good guys on the board 1-0 with a single to right field, which drove in Hardy from third. But that was all they would get as Schoop hit into a double play to end the inning.    From there, the Baltimore bats would stay annoyingly quiet until the seventh inning.    You go, Yo! Yovani Gallardo took the hill for the Orioles and did pretty darn well against a Colorado offense that has scored the second most runs in all of baseball. Through the first three innings he allowed only two runners on a single and hit by pitch, but did not give up a run. The fourth inning saw the Rockies tie things up at 1-1 when Arenado atoned for his two errors with a solo home run to left field, but then Gallardo struck out the side.    Double plays in the fifth and sixth inning kept Gallardo out of trouble. It seemed his luck would continue in the seventh inning. Following a walk to Carlos Gonzalez to lead off the frame, he got Trevor Story to fly out and then picked off Gonzalez at first base to clear the bases with two outs. But that is where his fortunate evening ended. David Dahl, making his major league debut, singled up the middle to nab his first career hit in ""the show"". Then he moved to second on a wild pitch, but it was some pretty lazy catching on the part of Wieters, if we\xe2\x80\x99re honest. Not that I am blaming the catcher. We don\xe2\x80\x99t do that around here. Ex-Oriole Mark Reynolds made it hurt when he singled up the middle to drive in Dahl and give the visitors a 2-1 lead. Gallardo exited the game there in favor of Mychal Givens, who would get Daniel Descalso to fly out to finish the seventh. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to be too disappointed with Gallardo\xe2\x80\x99s performance. He went 6.2 innings and allowed two runs on five hits, two walks and six strikeouts. If he could do that every time out, the Orioles will win a lot of games with him on the bump. Unfortunately, the bats were pretty quiet while he was on the mound, but they did enough to ensure he was not saddled with a bad luck loss.    Off the hook De La Rosa finally pitched like his ERA said he should in the bottom of the seventh inning. He bounced a cutter off of Nolan Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s foot and then gave up a double to Dariel Alvarez to give the O\xe2\x80\x99s men on second and third with just one out. That was the end of the southpaw\xe2\x80\x99s night as he was replaced by Adam Ottavino, who would limit the damage. Jones grounded out to shortstop, scoring Reimold and tying things up at two runs apiece. But that was the end of the scoring in ""regulation"" if you will. Yeah, the two teams played the eighth and ninth innings technically, but nothing really happened. As far as the Orioles go, Givens pitched a perfect eighth and Zach Britton looked nasty in the ninth. But, you know, like the good kind of nasty. Anyway... Worst. Walkoff. Ever. Chaz Roe came in to toss the 10th inning and looked OK, I guess. He made it through it. With two outs, Descalso singled and then moved to second base on a passed ball. Again, Wieters could have done a better job moving his feet back there, but the guy is just returning from a foot injury, so we won\xe2\x80\x99t bash him too bad. But Roe got out of the inning with a little help from the home plate umpire, who called strike three on Nick Hundley on a pitch that was a couple inches off the outside of the plate. Thanks, man! In the bottom of the inning, it was Jones again causing issues again with a one-out single. Schoop moved Jones all the way to third with a single of his own into right field. And then Manny Machado doubled off the scoreboard to win the game!!! WOO!......Oh no, wait, that is not what happened at all. That would have been actually cool. What actually occurred: Machado hit a squibber back to the pitcher (Jordan Lyles), who dropped the ball. It looked as if the righty kind of wanted to turn a double play and he kind of wanted to nab Jones at home. After recovering, he still had time to get the ball home, but he threw it slightly low, forcing Hundley to bend down. The catcher got his mitt to it, but then he dropped the ball too. Thanks, timely rain! Jones slid in, scoring the winning run and giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s their fifth consecutive victory. Whatever, a win is a win!    The cherry on top? The Red Sox lost a few minutes after the O\xe2\x80\x99s game concluded, so the Birds now lead the AL East by 2.5 games. Tomorrow Can they make it six in a row? They sure have a good chance with Chris Tillman (14-2, 3.18 ERA) starting. Colorado will send righty Chad Bettis (8-6, 5.31) to the bump. See you at the Yard.        ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
07/26/2016,"[('If the Orioles do make a trade, it should actually be for ...', ' The August 1st trade deadline is one week away and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear what the Orioles need the most (starting pitching) and what they will probably get (Melvin Upton Jr., for some reason). However, if the front office wants to get the best bang for their buck, they should actually look to add to their already strong bullpen.    Good pitching, bad pitching Relief pitching is one of the best things about the 2016 Orioles. Going into Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s slate of games, the \xe2\x80\x98pen had a collective ERA of 3.08, putting them fourth in MLB behind the Nationals (2.98), Dodgers (2.98) and Astros (3.06). On the flip side, the Baltimore rotation is in desperate need of repair. Despite a nice run of form over the last week, the starter\xe2\x80\x99s group ERA of 4.91 is 24th in baseball. It\xe2\x80\x99s so bad, in fact, that Ubaldo Jimenez is being rumored to start on Thursday. That is, if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t traded before then. The man has a 7.38 ERA this season, yet the Orioles decision-makers seem to prefer him to the likes of Tyler Wilson or Mike Wright.  Who is out there? However, what the Orioles need and what the trade market will supply do not line up well this summer. There are more teams looking for starting pitching than there are decent options available. But relief pitchers? There are plenty of those out there.    Going based off of MLB Trade Rumors\xe2\x80\x99 list of the top 50 trade candidates, these are the starters that are available and ranked from most likely to be dealt to less likely: Andrew Cashner, Rich Hill, Jake Odorizzi, Jeremy Hellickson, Ervin Santana, Matt Moore, Jorge De La Rosa, Ivan Nova, Jon Niese, Chris Archer, Julio Teheran, Anthony DeScalfini and Matt Shoemaker.    Just to trim it down, the Orioles definitely do not have enough quality prospects to nab Archer, Teheran, DeScalfini or Moore, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not even clear if those guys are totally available for trade. And De La Rosa, Nova and Niese are no better than what the team already has.  So, that leaves you with Cashner, Hill, Odorizzi, Hellickson and Santana; the five guys every other team has likely honed in on as well. If the O\xe2\x80\x99s want one of those guys, they may have to kiss at least one of Chance Sisco, Trey Mancini, Ryan Mountcastle, Chris Lee or Tanner Scott goodbye. Not that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that if they feel it greatly improves their team, but there are some doubts that it really does. They have gotten this far with subpar starters, so would one of these guys make a difference.    In the relief market you have lefties Will Smith, Boone Logan, Jake McGee, Fernando Abad, Zach Duke and Andrew Miller; and righties Jeremy Jeffress, Joe Smith, Huston Street, Jeanmar Gomez, Daniel Hudson, Tyler Clippard, David Robertson, Wade Davis and Steve Cishek. That\xe2\x80\x99s enough for every contending team to add a reliever if they want. Perfect fit To me, the southpaws stick out for the Orioles, who still don\xe2\x80\x99t have a regular left-handed option out of the \xe2\x80\x98pen besides closer Zach Britton.  Logan has an opponent batting average of .167 against righties and .154 against lefties. McGee has struggled in Colorado but was great in the AL East with Tampa for four years prior to that. Abad is more of a specialist with a lefties average against of .174 compared to .242 for righties, but still not a bad option. Duke is striking out 10.4 guys per nine innings. Of course, Andrew Miller would be perfect, but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t happening.    On the right handed side, the only option (other than Davis, who they probably don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough to get) that would really improve the team is the Mariners closer, Cishek. His wonky delivery and 11.9 strikeouts per nine innings would look great in the late innings on nights manager Buck Showalter wants to avoid his big three of Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Brad Brach and Britton. Keep them fresh Those big three need to be fresh for Baltimore to go deep into the postseason. Showalter has a reputation of being a shrewd handler of his bullpens. Recently, it has been his policy to avoid guys after they have pitched on back-to-back days whenever possible. It would make it much easier if the team had one more reliable arm. O\xe2\x80\x99Day, who will be 34 years old in October, is the team\xe2\x80\x99s second-oldest player behind shortstop J.J. Hardy and has recently come back from a hamstring injury, so he will certainly be watched closely. Brach, who made his first All-Star team, has been off lately, allowing three runs over his last two appearances. And while Britton has been phenomenal, it would be nice to give him a day off when needed. Shallow arms If you look closely at the Baltimore bullpen, while it is great, it is not particularly deep. Dylan Bundy, who was once one of their middle relief guys, has moved to the rotation. As has former longman Vance Worley. That means their current relief corps is made up of Wilson, Odrisamer Despaigne, Chaz Roe and Mychal Givens in addition to the late inning guys. Wilson has yo-yoed between Baltimore and Triple-A Norfolk and owns a 5.22 ERA this season in the bigs. Despaigne is the current longman and will probably be handcuffed to Bundy during his starts until he stretches out further than the fifth inning. Roe always feels as though he is on the precipice of disaster. And Givens goes from lights out one night to an implosion the next.     Long story, short: Yeah, the Orioles rotation isn\xe2\x80\x99t too good. But it would be easier (and cheaper) for the front office to add an impact arm to the back of an already talented bullpen. That effectively shortens how far the starters have to go into a game and allows the Birds to win games in a way that they are comfortable with: mash tons of dongs to get ahead, pray the starter can make it through five (maybe six) semi-decent innings and then hand the ball to your studs in the \xe2\x80\x98pen.

Seeing the winning run score at Camden Yards and the team rushing the plate from the dugout never gets old for an O\xe2\x80\x99s fan.And winning games in varied and strange fashion also brings back memories of the 96-win season of 2014. Baltimore won a total of 10 walkoff victories that year. And by the way, at 58-40, the Orioles are on exact pace to win 96 games again this year.The Rockies tried to give the game away early with errors, but the Orioles could not get the critically-needed hit. Colorado starter Jorge De La Rosa was hittable enough at the beginning, but after hanging around awhile got better as the innings passed.Meanwhile, Orioles starter Yovani Gallardo continued the recent stretch of quality starts by throwing 6.2 innings of two runs on five hits and a pair of walks.

But the pitching staff has a 2.68 ERA in 114 innings of baseball. They have moved up two places in ERA in the AL, going from next to last to 12th place.

It so often seems difficult to get the hitting and pitching working together. The more frequent scenario is needing, as recently, to squeeze out a low-scoring win; or as in the past, to outslug the opposition.Not wanting to steal defeat from the jaws of victory, but to rather be honest in analysis, there are troubling aspects of the current situation with the Orioles. Few are hitting well at all, and several \xe2\x80\x93 especially Davis \xe2\x80\x93 look rather lost at the plate.

But, he has been fantastic this year.Alas, Tillman isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only one.Zach Britton leads the American League in saves by four, over Francisco Rodriguez.He is top in the AL (and second only to Clayton Kershaw) in Win Probability Added.So, while all that looks good, there are more advanced statistics backing up Britton and Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s run for the Cy Young.ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Cy Young Predictor has Britton and Tillman first and second respectively, ten points ahead of Sale.The predictor, which allegedly is based on past results, uses a statistical formula of\xc2\xa0((5*IP/9)-ER) + (SO/12) + (SV*2.5) + Shutouts + ((W*6)-(L*2)) + VB. \xc2\xa0VB stands for Victory Bonus, a 12-point bonus for your team winning their division.So, let\xe2\x80\x99s look closer. Pitchers get points for innings pitched (of which Tillman has 11 less than league leaders Justin Verlander). They also get points for strikeouts, where Tillman would not be near the top, shutouts, which Tillman has none of, wins, and lack of losses.So, one could argue that Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy is largely based on his record. \xc2\xa0And while that may be true, if he finishes at 24-4, it would be very hard to deny him the Cy Young. \xc2\xa0Especially if he is near the league lead in wins, and having carried the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching staff.

The Rangers were also watching Hellickson, according to Crasnick, and the Marlins themselves - who\xe2\x80\x99ve now seen Hellickson hold then to a run in 14 innings in his last two starts - are \xe2\x80\x9cobviously in the mix.\xe2\x80\x9d Hellickson being available as a trade piece has been going on for long enough that he\xe2\x80\x99s had sufficient opportunity to pitch well enough to change the narrative about him. At least if you want to go by ERA, which is an admittedly imperfect metric in trying to assess how a pitcher will do in the near future, Hellickson has really surged in the last month.    Over his last seven starts, Hellickson has lowered that ERA from 4.46 to 3.65. In that time, he\xe2\x80\x99s held batters to a .199/.225/.319 batting line. That is an impressive streak of games. He\xe2\x80\x99s averaging just about six innings per start for the season. Keep in mind, though, that those recent starts came heavily against a number of MLB\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-tier run-scoring teams. The Marlins, who he just faced twice in a row, are 22nd in the league in runs scored. There were also starts against the Royals (27th), Mets (28th) and Braves (30th). So six of those seven starts have been against demonstrably crappy offenses. That\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly not very inspiring after all. Still, on the whole, Hellickson, 29, appears to be pitching about in line with his career numbers when it comes to things like batted ball luck (.267 BABIP this season vs. .272 career) and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any red flags like lost velocity. They shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too worried about regression in those areas.    And even if Hellickson is due to regress a bit, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be great to be an improvement. He merely has to be better than the worst spot in the Orioles rotation. Is Hellickson going to be better than Vance Worley for the remainder of the season? That\xe2\x80\x99s the real question. The pending free agent is making $7 million in his final year of arbitration. If the Orioles traded for him, they\xe2\x80\x99d be responsible for paying a little more than $2.5 million.

Suddenly the lights-out stuff was hanging in the middle of the plate, and the damage was done.Even so, the best and most optimistic takeaway from the evening was the dominant stuff from Bundy. All his pitches were working, and Orioles fans got to see both the power arm and the finesse pitcher that Bundy can be. He is putting it together and it is going to be very, very good.But again it was the offense that disappeared for Baltimore, as the O\xe2\x80\x99s did well to get four wins in the six home games. The Orioles are 7-6 since the All-Star break, having scored only 36 runs while giving up 38. The O\xe2\x80\x99s were 2-for-20 with runners in scoring position in the Colorado series; and since the ASG, they are 9-for-70 in those 13 games (.129).\xc2\xa0 A total of 70 opportunities in 13 games is not extraordinary, and to think that they have only gotten nine hits with RISP in 13 games is ghastly.Remember when the Orioles were either first or second with the Red Sox in the early portion of this season with RISP? Now the O\xe2\x80\x99s rank 10th in the American League at .270. Beyond that, they rank 13th in RISP opportunities, as only the A\xe2\x80\x99s and Rays have fewer. That is not going to make for a championship team.It is the pitching that has held the Orioles in these recent games and given them the chance to win most of them, it is not the powerful hitting that is carrying the team at this juncture.

Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t followers of the Birds have a sort of baseball fan bipolar disorder?Consider the following:Since June 22nd, the Baltimore Orioles won seven in a row, then lost five in a row, then won six of seven (with an Ubaldo loss), then lost four straight, then won five straight, and now have lost the last two games. All totaled that is 18-12, which is pretty good. But it wears on the psyche.Add to this that the Orioles are headed to Minnesota for a single game in the hands of Jimenez, before facing the Blue Jays with Melvin Upton added to the roster. UJ should be well-rested. What could go wrong? ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles prospects shut out of MLB Pipeline\\u2019s top 100 ...', ' The Orioles farm system is not very good. Just about everyone who isn\xe2\x80\x99t in some way employed by the Orioles agrees with that assessment. The latest example of that comes from the midseason update to MLB.com\xe2\x80\x99s top 100 prospects list, in which the Orioles are completely shut out.    The list reflects how the 2016 draft and the first half of the season\xe2\x80\x99s development (or lack thereof) has changed the stock of various prospects. While this is just one prospect list and prospect lists are an inherently subjective enterprise, it really says something about the O\xe2\x80\x99s system when they are unable to slip a couple of guys even into the bottom of the list.  Other evaluators might put catcher Chance Sisco in there, but even if they did, one guy in the top 100 isn\xe2\x80\x99t so much better for the system. Division rivals have many more.  There are five Yankees prospects and five Red Sox prospects on the top 100. The Rays have four, while the Blue Jays have only two.     The way things stand right now, the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t have impact prospects lined up to help the big league team in the future, nor do they have much in the way of depth to help the team right now if needed.    It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough thing for an organization to do to build for the future at the same time they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to build up the present. So the fact that the Orioles have ended up in this situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t so surprising, nor is it as concerning as it might be, as long as the MLB team keeps winning with some regularity. One reason the farm system is weak right now is that the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to pick until the third round of the 2014 draft due to signing Ubaldo Jimenez and Nelson Cruz as well as trading a pick - and Josh Hader, now the #45 prospect in baseball - to get Bud Norris.     Jimenez is a complicated topic, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that Cruz and Norris were a big part of why the 2014 team was able to do what they did. It\xe2\x80\x99s much better to have had a division champion banner hanging up for the last two years than it is to have a good farm system right now. There are other reasons too, of course. Some of those are questionable moves made to shore up the team, like last year\xe2\x80\x99s trades for Travis Snider and Gerardo Parra, and this year\xe2\x80\x99s signing of Yovani Gallardo. Moves that hurt the farm without helping the MLB team are a problem. Others are just head-scratchers, like why the Orioles keep dumping competitive balance draft picks in stupid salary relief trades, and why they eschew trying to sign top international amateurs.    So that\xe2\x80\x99s why things are the way they are. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s good or bad is something we can and surely will debate as the next couple of Orioles seasons roll along. With that in mind, here are the new top 10 Orioles prospects from MLB Pipeline. Top Ten Orioles Prospects  Cody Sedlock - RHP Chance Sisco - C Hunter Harvey - RHP Jomar Reyes - 3B Trey Mancini - 1B Ryan Mountcastle - SS Matthias Dietz - RHP Keegan Akin - LHP Chris Lee - LHP Tanner Scott - LHP  Someone who is either an optimist by nature or an Orioles employee by paycheck might spin it as a positive that the O\xe2\x80\x99s top draft pick is immediately their top prospect. While that might be true if the O\xe2\x80\x99s had picked, say, in the top 10 of the draft, Sedlock was the 27th pick. He might be better than the existing guys, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything good about the O\xe2\x80\x99s system. Not even the #1 overall pick, Mickey Moniak, became the best prospect in the Phillies system. Nor did Red Sox first rounder Jason Groome, considered a top five prospect in the draft, become the #1 Sox prospect. Groome is only fourth best in that system. A good or even decent farm system would already have a couple of players more advanced than a late-20s pick. The presence of Dietz and Akin on the back end of the top ten says something similar about the system. When you have two second rounders from the current year who\xe2\x80\x99ve already passed your first rounder from the previous year (D.J. Stewart, now #12 in the system) that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t speak very well of the prior top draft choice. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve read this far into an article about Orioles prospects, you probably already know about and have opinions of the holdovers from the top ten. Harvey is out for at least a year after Tommy John surgery. Lee hasn\xe2\x80\x99t pitched since May 23 due to a lat strain. Scott has thrown 101 in relief and may not be able to throw strikes.    Three other 2016 draft picks are among the top 30, making a total of six players drafted this year on the O\xe2\x80\x99s list. The others are third rounder Austin Hays (15), fourth rounder Brenan Hanifee (19) and seventh rounder Preston Palmeiro (21). I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why Palmeiro is ranked that high. Lists get weird sometimes. Putting six draftees right in the top 30 is probably another sign of a system that had been weak. Even the Phillies, picking at the top of every round, only added four players to their top 30 from this year\xe2\x80\x99s draft. That\xe2\x80\x99s also true for the Reds, who picked second. The Braves, who had three of the top 44 picks, added only those three players to their top 30. At the very bottom of the list is a newcomer who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t drafted this year. Alex Wells, a 19-year-old lefty signed out of Australia last year, has made his US debut for Aberdeen this year and has done nicely through seven starts. That\xe2\x80\x99s enough to get him in there at #30 on the O\xe2\x80\x99s rankings. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean a whole heck of a lot what some people put on prospect lists. What really matters is how these guys develop and perform, and whether some of them can turn into big leaguers.  Hopefully with hard work and good health, many of them can prove that their talent is better than these experts believe. The Orioles of the future could use the help. The Orioles of the present could use the trade bait.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

How crazy? Crazy like one reporter saying the Nationals would trade Lucas Giolito - the #4 prospect in baseball - to the Yankees for Andrew Miller, and another reporter saying that trade won\xe2\x80\x99t happen because it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough of a return for the Yankees. That\xe2\x80\x99s crazy!    The Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything crazy like that going on. What they do have is a rumor from ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Jerry Crasnick that the Orioles have \xe2\x80\x9cbeen talking with the Reds\xe2\x80\x9d regarding outfielder Jay Bruce. What? OK, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty crazy too, unless Bruce is suddenly a pitcher.  Crasnick goes on to note that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are more focused on pitching. That\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise to anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s watched the Orioles rotation this year. But as you look at the deals being made for the pitchers who are being traded, as well as the woeful state of the Orioles farm system, maybe they just can\xe2\x80\x99t get a pitcher. Maybe they have to try to improve another area of the team and hope for the best. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time that the Orioles have been linked to Bruce. They were said to be talking to the Reds about Bruce back in November, and Bruce was also considered to be an option in February, when the Orioles targeted and almost signed Dexter Fowler (sigh) and then signed Pedro Alvarez after the Fowler thing didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.    Both of those times, I wrote about not wanting Bruce because he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very good in 2014 and was still below league average even while rebounding somewhat in 2015.    As I often say, remember that I know even less than Jon Snow. Bruce rebounded in a big way at age 29 in the 2016 season. In the season to date, he\xe2\x80\x99s batting .271/.323/.572. It\xe2\x80\x99s the slugging percentage that really catches your eye as Bruce has slugged 25 home runs already. Last year he managed only 26 across the whole season. Bruce is making $12.5 million this season and has a $1 million buyout on a $13 million team option for next year. If he\xe2\x80\x99s going to hit 25 home runs by the end of July, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair price to pay, at least in money. Whether the prospect cost is something the Orioles could or should pay is always another story.    It probably won\xe2\x80\x99t happen anyway. There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why I always say, \xe2\x80\x9cProbably nothing will happen.\xe2\x80\x9d It usually won\xe2\x80\x99t! The Reds might trade Bruce to another team or just not trade him before the deadline. The Dodgers and Nationals are also in the picture on Bruce, Crasnick reported. Even if the Orioles could trade for Bruce, where would they fit him in? The most obvious answer seems to be that he\xe2\x80\x99d go in Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s spot in the lineup and on the roster. Alvarez has been OK after a bad April/May but he still has to be hidden against lefty pitchers. Bruce, at least, has hit for a .815 OPS against LHP. Bruce is like Alvarez in that he should probably never see the field. If you think that Mark Trumbo is a bad outfielder, you\xe2\x80\x99re not wrong, but consider this. As measured by the Defensive Runs Saved stat, Trumbo has been worth -3 runs. Bruce, as a right fielder this season, is worth -12 runs.    Now, one of those sayings is you have to use three years of defensive data. Bruce was worth -6 runs defensively in 2014, nearly evened out by a +5 in 2015. So what\xe2\x80\x99s that tell us? Maybe nothing at all. So, don\xe2\x80\x99t expect anything to happen. It\xe2\x80\x99s still interesting to know it\xe2\x80\x99s something the two teams apparently have discussed.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have become a team that both excites their fanbase with winning streaks, yet depresses the same with multiplied losses.What is a fan? The word \xe2\x80\x9cfan\xe2\x80\x9d is short for a \xe2\x80\x9cfanatic\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 someone who is emotionally invested in the team they follow. And that emotional investment in the 2016 Baltimore Orioles is becoming more difficult given the high highs, and the low lows.Every baseball team, even the best in the sport with the best record at the end of the year, is going to have some low times and piled-up losses by the end of the season. It is the nature of the game. A 100-win season is exceptional. St. Louis did it exactly last year. Prior to that it was the 2011 Phillies who won 102 games. The last AL team to do so was the Yankees in 2009. So that is three teams in seven seasons, which is equal to it happening once in 70 chances.A season with 100 wins is a percentage equal to an NFL team going 10-6. Though we would call that a successful football season, it is not exceptional. In some cases it might not even get you into the playoffs.All of this is to say that baseball fans have to put up with more disappointment over the course of a 162-game campaign and six months of mostly daily contests.Of these Orioles I have used the phrase that they have a baseball case of bipolar disorder, featuring big highs and lows. They are manic depressive with multiple personalities. Consider the past 32 games since June 22nd (20% of the season) \xe2\x80\xa6Won seven straight = 7-0Lost five straight = 7-5Won six of seven = 13-6Lost four straight = 13-10Won five straight = 18-10Lost four straight = 18-14The pretty good news is that the wins outnumber the losses and would combine for a pace to post a final record of 91-71.\xc2\xa0 But that sort of team is difficult to follow emotionally. It is sort of like dating a girl who loves you one weekend but seems completely disinterested in being with you on the following date. What is the real deal? What can you bank on?In the most recent loss to the Blue Jays last night by a 6-5 score, the Orioles came within a few feet in the ninth inning of getting a game-tying sixth run on a long J.J. Hardy fly ball. But, like most of July, the O\xe2\x80\x99s came up just short. The Orioles have only scored six runs twice in this month.Kevin Gausman simply had a terrible outing. It was Ubaldo-like in terms of a lack of command of secondary pitches. And the other half of the battery is playing poorly at this juncture, simply not looking at all like the Matt Wieters we know on defense. His throwing error was very costly, balls are getting past him, and offensively there is minimal contribution. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him props for getting angry enough at the umpire to verbalize the frustration, rather than just sitting back passively and taking it.Chris Davis looks just terribly lost, especially swinging over the top of diving pitches toward his back foot. He actually has a legit shot at setting the all-time single season strikeout record of 223, held by Mark Reynolds from 2009 with the Diamondbacks. Davis is on pace right now to register 221. His 208 strikeouts last year rank him as fifth all-time for a season. Exceeding 200 has only ever been done seven times in MLB history, three of them by Reynolds.

And it could yet happen for the Orioles.The Orioles have exactly 60 games remaining in the regular season.

(AP Photo/David Banks)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECHICAGO (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore is hoping Wade Miley can turn his solid July into a big finish with the AL East leaders.The Orioles acquired Miley in a trade with the Seattle Mariners on Sunday, giving manager Buck Showalter an experienced lefty for his rotation as the team tries to hold off Toronto and Boston for the division title.""Wade Miley is a workhorse veteran left-handed starter who likes to pitch and compete,"" said Dan Duquette, the executive vice president of baseball operations for the Orioles. ""We think he will contribute to this year\'s club with some quality innings.""Miley is 7-8 with a 4.98 ERA, but he had a 3.45 ERA in five July starts. He pitched seven innings of one-hit ball in Seattle\'s 4-1 victory against the major league-leading Chicago Cubs on Saturday.""He was probably as good as he has been all year,"" Seattle manager Scott Servais said after Saturday\'s win at Wrigley Field. ""He kind of brought a different attitude, mentality, whatever you want to say to the mound today. He was very aggressive from the get-go.""Miley was shagging fly balls before Sunday\'s 7-6 loss at Chicago when he left the field while Seattle continued taking batting practice. Servais soon followed him into the dugout.Seattle received left-hander Ariel Miranda in the trade. The Cuban pitcher has spent most of the year with Triple-A Norfolk. He appeared in one game for Baltimore on July 3 at Seattle, allowing three runs and four hits in two innings.""Ariel Miranda is a power left-handed pitcher with a four-pitch mix that is major league ready that provides us with flexibility,"" general manager Jerry Dipoto said in an email. ""We are very excited for what he can bring to the Mariners.""The 29-year-old Miley was selected by Arizona with the 43rd pick in the 2008 amateur draft and made his major league debut with the Diamondbacks in 2011. He is 56-54 with a 4.07 ERA in six years in the majors.Miley went 11-11 with a 4.46 ERA in 32 starts with Boston last year, and then was traded to Seattle in December.""We are glad that Wade can go from one team in playoff contention to another, and to a division that he has had success in during his career,"" Dipoto said. ""This decision is the best move for the Mariners\' present and future.""Miley is making $6 million this season and is owed $8.75 million in 2017. His contract includes a $12 million club option for 2018 with a $500,000 buyout.___AP freelance writer Mike Cranston in Chicago, AP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York and David Ginsburg in Baltimore contributed to this report.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The Birds just haven\xe2\x80\x99t come off as right since the all-star break, with the exception of last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s series against Cleveland. In some cases the pitching has been solid and the bats have slept, and in others it was both that were suspect.\xc2\xa0Yovani Gallardo\xc2\xa0was unable to go deep into yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game, as it was out of hand when the book closed on him. Gallardo\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.1 IP, 5 H, 5 R, 5 BB, 5 K.The five hits on five runs shows you that not only are the Orioles surrendering runs, but in doing so they\xe2\x80\x99re allowing their opponents to be very efficient. And the fact is that not only are Oriole pitchers leaving balls over the plate, but they\xe2\x80\x99re also somewhat predictable \xe2\x80\x93 as in some cases is the defense. How many times yesterday were Toronto hitters able to put the ball down the line while the outfield was shaded the other way?The O\xe2\x80\x99s actually had a 1-0 lead early when\xc2\xa0Pedro Alvarez homered in the second inning. However the fifth inning brought a donnybrook of Toronto runs, chasing Gallardo. Travis\xe2\x80\x99 solo homer tied the game, and Encarnacion\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double gave Toronto a 2-1 lead. Tulowitzki walked in a run, after which Toronto opened the game up with a two-RBI double. Pillar would follow suit with one of his own, and when the smoke cleared the Birds trailed 7-1.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WirePillar would also add a second two-RBI doule in the last of the seventh to run the score to 9-1. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s pitching or hitting, the O\xe2\x80\x99s just aren\xe2\x80\x99t playing well right now. It\xe2\x80\x99s happened to both Toronto and Boston at earlier parts of the season. And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s not time to hit the panic button on this team.The trends are concerning to say the least, and that should go without saying. However sometimes teams do in fact go through lulls over the course of a 162-game schedule. Heck, the Chicago Cubs, who most people thought were invincible, had a simliar stretch. It\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunately a part of the game.That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that the O\xe2\x80\x99s should just accept that and move on. You have to try to dig yourself out of that valley as hard as you can. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not easy, for sure. But keep in mind that this team is just too good at the plate to not have things work themselves out. Should a few eyebrows be raised? Perhaps. But should there be widespread panic? Not in my view.WIth the loss yesterday the O\xe2\x80\x99s did drop a half game out of first place, which is now occupied by Toronto. However a win this afternoon would put the Orioles right back in the top spot. So today is possibly a must-win game, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to manager a pennant race from ahead as opposed to from behind.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles: Three first inning homers do birds inThis afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game will be the series finale, which as I said could be seen as a must-win (if for nothing else, maybe for the sanity of the team).\xc2\xa0Chris Tillman will be on the mound for the Orioles,\xc2\xa0and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Aaron Sanchez.

The Baltimore Orioles won 6-2. Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles registered a high-level win of significance over the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday afternoon by defeating them 6-2 in 12 innings.Yes, a win is a win, whether it is a good team or bottom dweller. But beating the team that just beat you and took first place away from you the day before \xe2\x80\xa6 well, that\xe2\x80\x99s better than a victory over a rebuilding outfit. It is especially nice to do it in their ballpark, hanging around with their best starter, stretching their bullpen to 12 innings, frustrating their offence, and then breaking through at the end.It probably could be said that the Orioles needed this game more than the Blue Jays. It was needed to avoid a sweep and to end a losing streak. The Birds needed to beat Toronto in their ballpark, setting up the remaining six games against these bad birds. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are now 6-7 against the Jays this year, and the next time they will meet at the Rogers Centre will be seasonal games #157 to #159, just before a final three-game set at Yankee Stadium.Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game was honestly one that the Orioles probably should have lost. They were pretty much shut down by Aaron Sanchez over the first six innings. A critical double in the seventh inning that followed a Chris Davis walk would set up runs scoring on a groundout and a sac fly. This would be all that was scored until the 12th inning, as there were not many chances. For the entire game, the Orioles were only 2-for-5 with runners in scoring position. Those two hits were the 12th inning game-winning single of Jonathan Schoop that drove home Pedro Alvarez after his walk and balk to second base, and then the three-run homer that followed later by Adam Jones.Again, major props to the beleaguered and much maligned Orioles pitching staff. Chris Tillman kept the Orioles in the game by only yielding a two-run homer in his 5.2 innings, and then the bullpen combined for 6.1 scoreless innings of giving up only one hit and three walks. Mychal Givens gets the win to improve his record to 8-1 on the season. Only Tillman has more wins.This is a good time for an off day. The Orioles will host the Rangers for three games before heading out immediately again for a 10-game trip against the White Sox, A\xe2\x80\x99s, and Giants. Clearly this trip is going to be critical for the success of the 2016 Orioles.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoOn another note, Brian Matusz started a game yesterday for the Cubs and gave up a two-run homer in each of the first three innings, including Nelson Cruz (#26) and Cano.

Mandatory Credit: Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles wanted and needed to improve the production from their corner outfield and designated hitter positions as compared to 2015. How have they done?This is the second time this season that we have looked at this question, with the first occasion being about one-third of the way through the season. The two-thirds completed point of the season will be achieved after Friday\xe2\x80\x99s game.As a quick summary of the analysis below, the Orioles have definitely improved a bit in right field, significantly improved in left field, and considerably improved the power production from designated hitter.Here are comparative stats from 2015 / 2016 for these three positions, noting batting average, on-base percentage, and home runs from one year to the next. The rank for each stat speaks of where the number places the Orioles among American League teams\xe2\x80\xa6Avg><RankOBP><RankHR><Rank15 RF.2754th.3189th249th16 RF.2825th.3458th214th15 LF.21014th.28713th188th 16 LF.2734th .3374th 713th15 DH.2537th.30811th1411th16 DH.2496th.3089th281st\xc2\xa0Right Field 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 The 2015 stats in RF are always a bit surprising, as memory does not seem to recall the numbers as having a fourth-best ranking in batting average, for example. Twelve different players spent some time out there, with Gerrado Parra having the most games \xe2\x80\xa6 just 43. Delmon Young had 40 and Chris Davis 30, hitting nine homers in those 30 games. So the position was not a total loss in spite of the revolving door of others who brought down the total numbers. But the RF situation was very unsettled for the entire season.Right Field 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Though the overall average and OBP from right fielders this year is similar to 2015, Mark Trumbo has given it power that was lacking. From this position he has hit 16 while batting .292. (Breaking news, add one more!) \xc2\xa0Joey Rickard has gone .281 in 43 games, with Reimold .279 in 21 games.Left Field 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 These are ugly, ugly numbers. It was a year-long struggle with David Lough at .218 and Steve Pearce at .214.Left Field 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 It is Hyun Soo Kim who has most especially helped these numbers to look much better than a year ago. He has hit .337 in LF.\xc2\xa0 Nolan Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s .212 as the left fielder has not helped. In between is Joey Rickard at .254.\xc2\xa0 None are much of a power threat. Is there anything to be learned or noted from both Rickard and Reimold hitting much better as right fielders?Designated Hitter 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 The only thing keeping these numbers from being rather horrid was Jimmy Paredes catching fire for half a season with a .279 average in 81 games. Beyond that, there is little we would want to remember about designated hitters in 2015.Designated Hitter 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Pedro Alvarez has come on to be the most-used DH for the Orioles, now in 56 games. He has hit .260 and clubbed 15 home runs (Breaking news, add one more). In 42 games at DH has been Mark Trumbo, belting 12 homers and batting .241.\xc2\xa0 Chris Davis has the only other homer from DH, hitting it in one of two games in this role.But what if? \xe2\x80\x93 After the 2014 season, much of the Orioles fanbase was angry that the team did not spend aggressively to maintain Nelson Cruz and Nick Markakis. What would that look like now? We said at the time that this was a theme we were not going to forget and that we would re-visit from time to time. That each did well in 2015 was not shocking news. The concerns (such as they were) that kept the O\xe2\x80\x99s from a more aggressive effort had more to do with the back end of the potential deals rather than the front end.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles lost a 5-3 final (regular season) game to the Texas, as the Rangers hit six doubles and recorded three double plays.Forget that the Orioles hit three home runs to only one for Texas, as double trouble and a large dose of bad luck bit the O\xe2\x80\x99s all evening long. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of green grass on a baseball field, and the Rangers batters managed to find a lot of it on a whole variety of swings, good and bad and ugly.There is nothing new about the Baltimore Orioles hitting home runs. They now have 161 for the season, still good enough for best in the American League. But it is not like the Rangers are a doubles hitting outfit. They came into the game with only 163 of them, 13th-ranking in the American League. The Orioles have 189, which is fifth best; and the Red Sox have the most with 242.But six different Rangers players hit a double on this evening, and they were able to plate four of them along with a solo home run for the 5-3 win.Solo home runs by the Orioles were hit by Mark Trumbo, Pedro Alvarez and Hyun Soo Kim to account for all of the Orioles scoring. There really were no other chances to score, as the Birds were 0-for-0 with runners in scoring position. You read that correctly. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever written that before! No Orioles player made it to second base, other than with the three homers.Double play groundouts by Alvarez, Wieters and Schoop quickly evaporated any possibilities of a rally. Texas leads all of baseball with double plays on defense, leading by a large margin. It really is the pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s best friend.So what do we make of the first outing of Wade Miley for the Orioles? Going five innings he gave up four runs on eight hits, zero walks and five strikeouts. Jonathan Lucroy hit a solo home run, but honestly it was off a very good pitch. There were more than a couple of cheap hits, including a pair that scored the third and fourth of the runs. At the same time, his pitches are not extra special. His breaking and off-speed stuff has some nice dive to it. Hopefully he will pitch skillfully and add up the innings over his tenure with the Orioles.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles won a free-for-all baseball game over the Chicago White Sox 7-5 to get their critical 10-game road trip off to a good start.It is always a good thing to win the initial game of a road trip, but the Orioles had to use a lot of bullets \xe2\x80\x93 meaning a lot of resources \xe2\x80\x93 to do just that. Fortunately it was not an extra-innings game.Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it feel like an easy night when you pound out 16 hits while your starter earns a quality start with just two runs allowed? One would think so. But this was not an evening when it ever felt like the game was in the bag, not even with a 7-2 lead in the eighth inning.With 10 games in 10 days over three cities, it would be great to not have to use a lot of energy and tools for the opening game. Yovani Gallardo had one of those bend but don\xe2\x80\x99t break evenings, scattering seven hits and enjoying some hard-hit balls right at people. At the same time, the Orioles had an uncharacteristic four-error game. Were the seats uncomfortable on the flight to Chicago?Speaking of uncharacteristic, it was such an evening for Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day in yielding three runs with just one-third of an inning to his credit. His ERA went from 2.45 to 3.46 in one evening. That can happen to relievers and skew numbers in a hurry, which is why I like to look at relief statistics by throwing out the two worst games a pitcher has over the season. Everyone has a bad game or two, but if a reliever is consistently good over 90% of the time, that\xe2\x80\x99s a keeper.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoZach Britton came on for the 48th time this season to record his 34th consecutive save. If you throw out his worst two outings of the season, that would mean he has only allowed one run in 45 innings. It would be a 0.20 ERA. Even so, his actual ERA at this point is 0.58, the best in MLB.Talk is building that Zach is a legit Cy Young candidate. That would be great and he may well deserve it, though I have my doubts that it would go to a relief pitcher. The last reliever was Dennis Eckersley in 1992, so I guess it is possible. For comparison\xe2\x80\x99s sake, he had a 1.91 ERA that year in 69 games with 93 strikeouts in 80 innings, converting 51 of 54 save opportunities. So it looks like Britton has the better ERA so far and will have similar total saves, though Zach would look to likely end with less innings, games and strikeouts. Consider however that the batting average against with Eckersley in 1992 was .191, but for Britton it is currently .138!Next: Improved Orioles Outfield and DH ProductionBut for now, it is great to have the win in the books, especially since Toronto was also victorious.

The Orioles will head further west when they visit the Oakland Athletics in the opener of a four-game series on Monday. Manny Machado became the second player in history to homer in each of the first three innings when Baltimore dominated the rubber match with a 10-2 win at the Chicago White Sox on Sunday. Machado drove in a career-high seven runs in the win and finished up the weekend 7-for-15 with nine RBIs and five runs scored to lead the Orioles offense. The Athletics are stumbling along in last place in the AL West and totaled three runs while being swept at home in a three-game series by the Chicago Cubs over the weekend.

PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (3-8, 4.08 ERA) vs. Athletics RH Kendall Graveman (7-7, 4.46) Gausman bounced back from a terrible start in a loss at Toronto on July 29 by holding Texas to two runs in seven innings while striking out seven in a win on Wednesday. The LSU product yielded one home run in that win and has had some trouble keeping the ball in the park with 20 homers allowed in 110 1/3 total innings. Gausman is still looking for his first road win of 2016 and is 0-7 with a 5.62 ERA in 11 starts away from home.

The Tides got on the board in the first inning with a solo shot by Trey Mancini, who also doubled home a run in the sixth.    Michael Almanzar added a solo homer of his own in the seventh, and Corban Joseph tacked on the final insurance run with an RBI single in the eighth. Mancini, Joseph and Dariel Alvarez (2-4, 2B) combined for six of Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s nine hits. Bowie Baysox 6, Richmond Flying Squirrels (SF) 4 Richmond took a quick 2-0 lead in the first inning off of Bowie starter John Means, but Means was able to settle down and get through five innings with a total of three runs allowed. The Baysox took the lead back for good in the fourth, when a two-run single by Drew Dosch capped off a four-run inning. A Chris O\xe2\x80\x99Brien homer in the sixth and a Joey Terdoslavich RBI double in the eighth extended the lead to 6-3.    Jesus Liranzo pitched two perfect innings in relief of Means, and Donnie Hart was able to secure the save despite allowing a solo home run in the ninth.    Frederick Keys 5, Winston-Salem Dash (CHW) 2 The Keys were down 2-0 heading into the top of the fifth, but that changed quickly when the offense went nuts and chased Winston-Salem starter Zach Thompson from the game. Frederick led off the inning with four straight singles followed by a two-run double from Cameron Kneeland.  By the time the dust settled on the top of the fifth, the score was 5-2. That would end up being the final score thanks to some good relief pitching, include two shutout innings from Garrett Cortright.     Starter Franderlin Romero has struggled to an ERA over six since being acquired from the Reds in May, but he was solid in this one. He ended up lasting five innings, with five strikeouts and just the two runs allowed. In other news, D.J. Stewart went 3-5 and is now hitting .280/.391/.430 in 31 games since his promotion.

In his second Delmarva start, Peluffo was chased in the fifth after allowing eight runs on eight hits and two walks. Only three of those runs were earned thanks to three errors from the Shorebirds\xe2\x80\x99 defense, but Peluffo\xe2\x80\x99s ERA is still sitting at 10.80 after two outings.    Dariel Delgado replaced Peluffo and didn\xe2\x80\x99t fare any better - he allowed five runs in just an inning of work. That was too much of a hole for the Delmarva offense, who managed to make the result look at least a little respectable. Randolph Gassaway and Stuart Levy each hit solo home runs, and Gassaway added two more RBIs with a single in the fifth. Nataneal Delgado was 2-4 with a run scored, and Ryan Mountcastle was 1-5 with 2 RBI.  Connecticut Tigers (DET) 2, Aberdeen Ironbirds 1 (Game 1, 7 innings) Alex Wells got the start for the Ironbirds but had to leave the game after just one batter when he was hit by a line drive up the middle. ReportsXavier Borde replaced him and allowed back-to-back doubles to give Connecticut a quick two-run lead. Borde settled down after that, and ended up pitching three innings with five strikeouts and no further runs. Max Knutson finished out the game and was terrific, with four K\xe2\x80\x99s and just one hit over three innings of his own. Those two first-inning runs were all the Tigers needed. Cole Billingsley cut the lead in half with an RBI single in the seventh, but ended up stranded at second as an Alejandro Juvier flyout ended the ballgame.    Aberdeen Ironbirds 3, Connecticut Tigers 0 (Game 2, 7 innings) Keegan Akin started game two and continued to impress by throwing three one-hit innings, although he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any strikeouts. Steven Klimek matched Akin with three one-hit innings of relief. Aberdeen wasted no time getting on the board in the first inning, when Ronarsy Ledesma doubled home Ryan McKenna and Guillermo Salas. The Ironbirds went quietly the next few innings, until Jaylon Ferguson picked up an RBI double in the sixth. Those were the only two extra-base hits in the game for Aberdeen.

A number of those stars will wink out after the 2016 season. O\xe2\x80\x99s fans will have to find some new players to receive their ire for years to come.    Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s announcement by the Yankees of the upcoming release of Alex Rodriguez is only the latest example of one of those stars fading from the sky. The season-long retirement tour of Boston\xe2\x80\x99s David Ortiz has gotten a ton of press as well, and let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget the more recent news of a pending retirement for Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira. Two of those three guys have been around in the division for more than a decade. Hardly anybody among baseball fans likes Rodriguez, mostly because of stuff like this. The Vandal, David Ortiz, petulant whiner that he is, once destroyed a dugout phone at Camden Yards and suffered almost no punishment whatsoever because he is the Teflon of MLB. Nothing sticks. Teixeira is not even worth the trouble of booing for any other fanbase, but, since he\xe2\x80\x99s from Maryland and he signed a big contract with the Yankees, he gets mercilessly booed. This has been the case every game since his first as a Yankee, the Opening Day game in 2009.    If one wanted to be rational about it, there\xe2\x80\x99s no real reason to hold a grudge with Teixeira over that whole thing. The Orioles supposedly offered \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d $140 million, so of course he went to the Yankees for another year and $40 million more.     It\xe2\x80\x99s not like it would have been a good idea to blow that much money on Teixeira at that point in time, anyway. Imagine if the 2009 Orioles improved just enough that they were still very bad, but not so bad that they would have been able to draft Manny Machado in 2010. That would have been a disaster. But he spurned his home state for the Yankees, so the boos have never faded. When these three guys are gone at the end of the year, who will be left for Orioles fans to dislike with such a fiery intensity?    For the most part, it takes some familiarity to breed such contempt. Players outside of the O\xe2\x80\x99s division just aren\xe2\x80\x99t seen enough to build a specific grudge against them. Sure, Bryce Harper has an idiotic-looking haircut and said some dumb stuff about Camden Yards that one time.  Yet as things stand with the current schedule, Harper and the rest of the Walgreens corporate baseball team only show up in Baltimore for two games a year. This sort of thing mostly rules out any non-AL East team, although of course, the lucky fluke Royals, enablers of Yordano Ventura intentionally hitting batters in retaliation, are plenty annoying. Even the Royals, who sliced the Orioles to death with papercuts in the 2014 ALCS, don\xe2\x80\x99t really have any one player good enough to be worth hating year after year, and unless a playoff rematch is coming, there won\xe2\x80\x99t be many opportunities to build up that kind of bad blood. So that leaves the AL East opponents.    New York Yankees The great villain of my adolescence, Derek Jeter, has now been gone for two years. When Teixeira and A-Rod are gone, will there even be any Yankees left who are worth hating? Brian McCann had his whole fun police thing in Atlanta, but that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been directed at the Orioles so much. Brett Gardner has been around for a while, yet does he rise to the grudge level? Same with Jacoby Ellsbury, who, going from the Red Sox to the Yankees, would seem to be a prime candidate for dislike, but come on. Also, these guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t still good. They\xe2\x80\x99re not worth hating any more. The Yankees as an institution are and will remain hated by all civilized beings in the universe. Until they\xe2\x80\x99re good again, specific players may well be spared our ire. Boston Red Sox No one should go around punching other people in the face. Dustin Pedroia has the kind of face who makes you give some thought to punching other people in the face, though. He\xe2\x80\x99s annoying, gets more attention than he deserves because he plays in Boston, and has been kinda good for a while... but is he really grudge-worthy? Ortiz has been sucking up all of that oxygen for quite some time. And while the various young Red Sox players, like Jackie Bradley Jr., Xander Bogaerts, and Mookie Betts, are good and will be annoying for years to come, there\xe2\x80\x99s no specific reason to boo any of them, yet.    The greasemaster, Clay Buchholz, is about to be a free agent and probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be around to hate any longer, either. Tampa Bay Rays LOL Toronto Blue Jays Now we\xe2\x80\x99re getting somewhere. Screw these guys, right? There\xe2\x80\x99s Jose Bautista, who, speaking of people you want to punch in the face, actually got punched in the face. He is an irritating prancing peacock and he seems like he is incapable of experiencing joy. Remember that time he tried to throw out Delmon Young on a single to right field and hurt his shoulder? Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget about Edwin Encarnacion and his ridiculous invisible parrot home run trot, either. I do not like either one of those guys... and yet, even then, both of them are free agents after this season. They might not stick around to be regularly booed by Orioles fans. Ahh, but a new challenger arises. Also on the Blue Jays is Josh Donaldson, the reigning AL MVP. Donaldson was traded to Toronto with some existing baggage with Orioles fans, having been involved in the play that led to Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s bat throwing incident. Did Machado wildly overreact to the fact that Donaldson tagged him on that particular occasion? Of course he did. This is not the time for rationality, though. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how this works. This is about having a guy to boo forever and ever, amen.    Donaldson would be annoying enough just by virtue of Oakland gifting him to the Jays just in time for him to win the MVP award. He\xe2\x80\x99d be more annoying still because of Jays fans chanting \xe2\x80\x9cMVP!\xe2\x80\x9d at him even though he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually the best AL player last year. Also, he has stupid hair. My mom thought this haircut would look cool on me in 1990. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t look cool on me then and it looks even worse on Donaldson in 2016. I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve found a winner. Unless something happens to change it between now and then, Donaldson will be Birdland Enemy #1 starting in the 2017 season.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Dennis Wierzbicki-USA TODAY SportsAs the Baltimore Orioles are now into the final third of the 2016 season, who are the offensive players on this team who have historically performed the best in the months of August and September?The O\xe2\x80\x99s are going to need a lot of clutch performances and players at the top of their game through the end of the regular season if they are to hold off the Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox. Baltimore probably has the arguably most difficult schedule of the three teams. The Birds are going to have to earn it. Who can they most count upon?Many factors go into why players perform better from year to year, or from one part of a season as compared to another. But there is something to be said positively for a baseball player who fairly regularly puts up good numbers at the most critical time of the season.So let\xe2\x80\x99s divide the career statistics of Orioles players by the first four months of a season (April thru July) and the last two months of the season (August and September). We\xe2\x80\x99ll include the few games of either March or October with the nearby month, thus giving us a rather definitive first two-thirds of seasons versus final one-thirds. We\xe2\x80\x99ll look at batting averages for each division, as well as home run frequency of plate appearances per homer hit. And the final column will highlight each player\xe2\x80\x99s historically best month of the year over his career.Ranking the current Orioles, here we go from best to worst \xe2\x80\xa6NameAvg 1-4Avg 5-6PA/HR 1-4PA/HR 56Best MonthDavis.243.26617.617.4SeptemberWieters.251.26532.426.5SeptemberReimold.249.26625.431.6SeptemberHardy.254.26833.029.8MayAlvarez.233.24920.320.8JuneFlaherty.212.22742.322.7JuneJoseph.217.22149.424.7AugustMachado.290.27726.226.6JuneSchoop.255.25326.224.8JuneJones.284.26124.828.3JunePearce.267.23829.227.6MayTrumbo.260.23918.323.4April\xc2\xa0With this being the first year for Hyun Soo Kim, he does not have late-season statistics yet. I was unable to find splits for his KBO years, but I think we can surmise that he was a rather consistent hitter throughout seasons.So what we can take from these numbers? It is not terribly encouraging. I did not enter this exercise with the thought that it would be surprisingly good, but it is worse than I imagined.The stats would seem to indicate that Chris Davis has to come alive. And it is surprising to see Matt Wieters and Nolan Reimold near the top. One would presume the wear and tear of catching would cause Wieters to wear down over the course of a season. We remember the good start Reimold had a few years ago before the serious injury took him out.The bulk of the Orioles lineup is rather consistent overall, including players like J.J. Hardy and Jonathan Schoop. Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s numbers are lower for the final third by a slight amount, though he may have made up for all of this over just the past couple of games!And finally, it is no surprise at all to see that Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 numbers are quite lower in the final third of a season. We have seen him wear down over the past couple of years as the season wore on. And more than a few folks have noticed the severe splits disparity for Mark Trumbo from early season to late season.None of this is encouraging for a team that has over the past number of weeks often had trouble scoring, like last evening again for example \xe2\x80\xa6 failing once more to give Kevin Gausman sufficient run support in a 3-2 loss to Oakland.

At the time he was selected, Bundy was just an 18-year-old high school baseball player for Owasso HS in Owasso, Oklahoma. The Oklahoma high school standout was 11-0 in 71 innings pitched with a 0.30 ERA and 158 strikeouts his senior year for the Owasso Rams.Coming out of high school, Bundy was praised for his curveball and cutter along with his extraordinary body control that allowed him to maintain a 98 mph fastball late into games. After being selected fourth overall in the 2011 First-Year Player Draft in June, the Orioles made it official by signing Bundy to a Major League contract which was a five-year deal, including a $4 million signing bonus. Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s bonus was the second highest in Orioles history, coming up short to the $6 million signing bonus to Orioles catcher Matt Wieters.On March 11, 2012, the Baltimore Orioles optioned Bundy to the Delmarva Shorebirds, the Orioles Class A Minor League Baseball affiliate team. Bundy pitched 30 innings, giving up zero earned runs, and 40 strikeouts for the Shorebirds. The Orioles quickly promoted to the Frederick Keys, a Class A Advanced Affiliate team for the Baltimore Orioles. With the Keys, Bundy started 12 games with a 6-3 record and a 2.84 ERA. Finally, after a short stint with the Bowie Baysox\xe2\x80\x99s, Bundy joined the Orioles in September of 2012, pitching just 1.2 innings.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireAfter making it to the majors in 2012, the Orioles had plans for Bundy to contribute to the team in 2013, but those plans were destroyed as the 20-year-old experienced arm soreness throughout spring training. After an MRI revealed no damage in Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s right elbow and undergoing treatment in April, Bundy resumed baseball activities in June. Bundy immediately felt distressed in his elbow after throwing from 120 feet. Bundy then underwent a second MRI which revealed a small tear in his elbow after attempting to resume baseball activities. According to ESPN, after being examined by team orthopedist Dr. John Wilckens and Dr. James Andrews, it was decided, Bundy would need Tommy John surgery on his injured right elbow. \xc2\xa0After surgery, Bundy slowly returned in the second half of the 2014 season and threw just 22 innings over eight starts in 2015, posting a 3.68 ERA with 25 strikeouts before a strained shoulder once again sidelined him for the season. However, after another setback in 2015, Bundy found himself in the bullpen for the Baltimore Orioles to start the 2016 season. Bundy pitched well in April, providing Orioles fans with a sigh of relief as he pitched nine innings out of the bullpen with a 2.00 ERA.

However, Bundy struggled by allowing three home runs in just 3.1 innings pitched and eventually departed the game after reaching his pitch limit of 70 in a 5-2 loss at Tropicana Field. His fastball reached the mid-nineties, but Bundy showed fatigue which resulted in a dip in velocity. Despite the loss, it was an inspiring moment for the Orioles organization given the long road Bundy took to become a member of the Orioles pitching rotation.Bundy made his second career start against the Cleveland Indians and was fantastic. Unlike his first start, Bundy displayed no signs of fatigue. In a win against the Cleveland Indians, Bundy tossed 87 pitches in five innings, not allowing an earned run with five strikeouts to capture his first career win as a starting pitcher. Bundy went on to bring a no-hitter into the sixth innings in back to back games against the Colorado Rockies and American League-leading Texas Rangers. He followed that up with two wins in 13 innings pitched and struck out 16 batters in his last two starts.

But it\xe2\x80\x99s a quality start.The O\xe2\x80\x99s got an RBI-double from Matt Wieters, and an RBI-single from Adam Jones in the second inning to take a 2-0 lead.

08/14/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles at San Francisco Giants - USA TODAY', ""SAN FRANCISCO -- Madison Bumgarner shut out the Baltimore Orioles over seven innings and Denard Span accumulated four RBIs with a pair of two-run singles Saturday night  propelling the San Francisco Giants to a 6-2 interleague victory. Joe Panik laced two ground-rule doubles and Brandon Belt smacked a two-run homer  helping the Giants even the three-game series at 1-1 and the all-time series between the teams at 7-7. The win allowed the Giants (66-50) to retain a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers (65-51) in the National League West. The Orioles (65-51)  meanwhile  fell a half-game behind the Toronto Blue Jays (66-51) in the American League East. Bumgarner (11-7)  who hadn't won since July 10  snapped a personal three-game losing streak by limiting the Orioles to three hits over his seven innings. He walked three and struck out eight. The All-Star's only tense moment came in the sixth inning  with the Giants clinging to a 2-0 lead. A double by Manny Machado put the potential tying runs in scoring position with just one out. But Bumgarner got Mark Trumbo to foul out to catcher Buster Posey and  after walking Jonathan Schoop to load the bases  struck out Chris Davis to end the threat. Trumbo and Davis homered in Baltimore's 5-2 victory that opened the series Friday night. The Giants scored their runs in twos  with Panik and Span combining to produce a pair of two-run innings in almost identical fashion. Panik twice one-hopped the outfield fence at AT&T; Park  a ground-rule double that advanced Hunter Pence in the second inning and Eduardo Nunez in the sixth to third base. Span followed two batters later with two-run singles  the first off Orioles starter Kevin Gausman (3-10) and the second off reliever Vance Worley. Panik became the first Giant since Andres Galarraga in 2001 to record two ground-rule doubles in the same game. Belt's homer followed a walk to Angel Pagan and capped the scoring in the seventh inning off Baltimore's third pitcher  Ubaldo Jimenez. Bumgarner and the San Francisco bullpen carried a shutout two outs into the ninth inning  but pinch-hitter Ryan Flaherty delivered a bases-loaded  two-run single off the fourth Giants pitcher  Javier Lopez  to get the Orioles within 6-2. Closer Santiago Casilla came on and threw one pitch  getting Adam Jones to ground to third to earn his 27th save. Panik also singled and walked in a 3-for-3 performance for the Giants  who won for only the ninth time in 26 games since the All-Star break. Angel Pagan and Buster Posey walked three times apiece for San Francisco  which drew nine walks from the three Orioles pitchers. Machado and J.J. Hardy had doubles for the Orioles  who fell to 4-5 on their 10-game trip that ends Sunday. Gausman was pulled after an adventurous four innings  during which he walked a career-high six and got nine of his 12 outs via strikeouts. The nine strikeouts equaled his most this season and was one off his career high set in an eight-inning effort last Sept. 30 against Toronto. He'd never previously walked more than four in a start. One of the walks contributed to the Giants' two-run second inning. After Gausman walked Hunter Pence leading off the inning  Joe Panik doubled to put two runners in scoring position. They both scored on Denard Span's two-out single  putting the Giants on top 2-0. The two hits and two runs were the only ones Gausman allowed in his four innings. He stranded six baserunners.

Mandatory Credit: Lance Iversen-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles came back from a 7-1 deficit in San Francisco on Sunday afternoon to win 8-7 in a game that may be remembered later as the critical turning point of the season.Critical game? Really? Time will tell, but there is no doubt that it was a \xe2\x80\x9cyuge\xe2\x80\x9d win for the Birds. Coming back from being six runs down is a big deal that does not often happen. And doing it on the final game of a 10-game road trip to the west coast is even bigger. And making it happen with two outs in the ninth inning in the ballpark of one of the better teams is biggest. With a three-run homer \xe2\x80\xa6 priceless.Even in the past offseason, we were looking ahead to this road trip at this point of the 2016 season as a critical part of the schedule. Locked for months in a three-way race with the Blue Jays and Red Sox, the Orioles needed to avoid a total disaster on the road\xe2\x80\x94an unfriendly place for this version of the O\xe2\x80\x99s. To have a 4-6 record would not exactly be a disaster, but to get this game and have a 5-5 trip is a reasonable success.This is especially true since the Orioles remain only a half-game behind the Jays and 1.5 ahead of the Sox, both big winners on Sunday. The Birds opened the road trip in a tie with Toronto and up two games over the Red Sox. So they only lost a half-game to each while playing in Chicago, Oakland and San Francisco. We can accept that.Baltimore is now 66-51, being 39-17 at home and 27-34 on the road. There are 45 games remaining in the season, 25 at home and 20 on the road.The big blow on Sunday was by Jonathan Schoop, hitting a home run off Giants closer Santiago Casilla after Manny Machado singled and Mark Trumbo walked. He hit an 0-1 pitch over the left-centerfield wall for his 18th home run of the season.Having played every moment of every game all season long, it has been a good year for Schoop. As did a number of other Orioles outlets, here at The Baltimore Wire we called for the O\xe2\x80\x99s second baseman to have a significant breakout year. Though it could be argued that Schoop has fallen short of that, he has continued his progression as a regular major league player. His overall stats are largely similar to those of his 86 games played last year, though the run-producing component is better this time around.Schoop is batting .282 currently, having hit .279 in 2015. He hit 15 homers then in only 86 games, raising hopes he could go 30+ this year. That may not happen, but there is no doubt that he is an offensive asset for the Orioles, let alone speaking of his defensive prowess and incredible arm.The Orioles will have Schoop for another three years before he qualifies as a free agent. They could be very special. But right now the Birds really need Schoop to continue with some clutch hitting, be it in the first inning or ninth inning.

Good teams do this. The Orioles have the third-most come-from-behind victories in MLB. However it is only the second time when trailing in the eighth inning or later. Winning clutch games is the mark of a championship outfit, and with a bullpen such as the Orioles have, along with their offensive breakout power, this is a team that should win some games by coming back in the latter innings.

Mandatory Credit: Lance Iversen-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles just finished a road trip at 5-5. \xc2\xa0Not just any road trip, but a West Coast road trip in Oakland and San Francisco, with the Chicago White Sox at the start.For a team that is 27-34 on the road, to split a West Coast trip (their last of the year) is not bad. But, there are several items inside the games that help make the trip another successful one for the Orioles.First, they won two of the three series. Only a 1-3 series against the Oakland Athletics was a series loss for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. They beat the White Sox in two out of three and did the same to the NL West-leading San Francisco Giants.The pitching in the games was pretty good. The O\xe2\x80\x99s left up 5 (in a bizarre game where the bullpen blew up), 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 6 (another game where the bullpen struggled), 2, 6, and 7 runs in those ten games.These were the numbers by the starters in those 10 games:1 \xe2\x80\x93 7-5 W over the White Sox: Gallardo (W) 6 IP, 7 H, 2 ER, 3 K2 \xe2\x80\x93 2-4 L vs. CWS: Tillman (L) 6 IP, 7 H, 3 ER, 4 K3 \xe2\x80\x93 10-2 W vs CWS: Bundy (W) 6 IP, 4 H, 2 ER, 9 K4 \xe2\x80\x93 2-3 L vs. Athletics: Gausman (L) 6 IP, 6 H, 2 ER, 6 K5 \xe2\x80\x93 1-2 L vs. A\xe2\x80\x99s: Miley (L) 6 IP, 6 H, 2 ER, 2 K6 \xe2\x80\x93 0-1 L vs. A\xe2\x80\x99s: Gallardo (L) 6 IP, 4 H, 1 ER, 6 K7 \xe2\x80\x93 9-6 W vs. A\xe2\x80\x99s: Tillman (W) 7 IP, 5 H, 2 ER, 4 K8 \xe2\x80\x93 5-2 W vs. Giants: Bundy (W) 5.2 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 3 K9 \xe2\x80\x93 2-6 L vs. Giants: Gausman (L) 4 IP, 2 H, 2 ER, 9 K 6 BB10 \xe2\x80\x93 8-7 W vs. Giants: Miley 4.1 IP, 8 H, 6 ER, 1 KSo, what can we take from those starts? \xc2\xa0Well, the only one in which the starting pitcher did not get a decision was the comeback win on Sunday, where Wade Miley exited early and struggled.In addition, the first seven games of the trip were all quality starts. However, four of them were losses. \xc2\xa0So, the offensive struggles continue to keep the O\xe2\x80\x99s from the top of their potential.Dylan Bundy earned wins in both his starts, Kevin Gausman losses in both of his, although he only allowed two runs in each start.Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s start on Saturday was hampered by six walks, although comments by both he and Buck Showalter after the game indicated he was better than his line.For a team that continues to be all about the pitching, this trip was a success. \xc2\xa0The only pitcher who is really not keeping the O\xe2\x80\x99s in games at this point is Wade Miley. \xc2\xa0Hopefully he can settle in over the next few starts.The bullpen had a few hiccups, but not enough to blow any games. The Birds will have to rely on Mychal Givens more, and also Donnie Hart. \xc2\xa0Hart has been very good in his use as a lefty specialist.

08/16/2016,"[('Five things that must happen for Orioles to make playoffs', 'Chris Davis is hitting .160 with a .295 on-base percentage in 27 second-half games.(Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports)CONNECTTWEET                              2                      LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREI guess, technically, the true stretch run in baseball occurs around Sept. 1.We\xe2\x80\x99re still in the dog days of August \xe2\x80\x93 something that has left renowned philosopher William Nathaniel Showalter wondering why it\xe2\x80\x99s not \xe2\x80\x9ccat days\xe2\x80\x9d of August.Anyway, it\xe2\x80\x99s crunch time at Camden Yards for the Baltimore Orioles.Tuesday marks the beginning of an eight-game homestand, a 16-game jaunt without an off day and 19 consecutive contests against clubs with records above .500. Of their 45 games remaining in the regular season, the Orioles only play 10 against sub-.500 teams, seven versus the Tampa Bay Rays and three versus the Arizona Diamondbacks.There are some favorable nuances in the remaining schedule \xe2\x80\x93 three off days in September, for instance \xe2\x80\x93 and some unfavorable things, such as non-division games against a trio of tough opponents: The Houston Astros, Detroit Tigers and National League East power Washington Nationals.Ultimately, the Orioles control their own destiny. Win at their current pace, win enough in the division and on the road, and get into the playoffs. That, of course, is simplistic. Here are five things the Orioles must do to have a better chance at their third postseason in five years.***Bring down the AL EastThe ultimate goal is to get into the playoffs, no matter the manner of entrance. So winning the American League East is not essential. But the division crown is there for the taking. The Orioles play 31 of their final 45 games against division rivals: six versus the Toronto Blue Jays, seven versus the Rays and nine each against the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees.The Orioles are currently 26-19 against AL East teams, the best record of the group. The Blue Jays have the second best mark at 27-21. The Blue Jays have won seven of 13 against the Orioles this season with six left to play \xe2\x80\x93 three each in Baltimore and Toronto.Obviously, the Orioles would love to get home-field advantage and force the Blue Jays into a one-game Wild Card matchup. A big help would be beating Toronto in four of the next six head-to-head matchups to win the season series.***Win on the roadThe Orioles are great at Camden Yards, better than any team in the AL at 39-17. Only the National League Central\xe2\x80\x99s Chicago Cubs have more home wins than the Orioles.But that road record, 27-34, is much less desirable. When I recently wrote about the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 road troubles, one commentor on our Facebook page asked, almost defensively, \xe2\x80\x9cHow many teams are good on the road?\xe2\x80\x9dThe answer: Of the seven clubs currently playing .560 or better baseball, only the Orioles have a losing road record. It\xe2\x80\x99s just one of those baseball truisms \xe2\x80\x93 good teams win on the road. The Orioles have 20 games away from Camden Yards remaining, and they need to make the most of them. Not sure what the formula is \xe2\x80\x93 more focus? \xe2\x80\x93 but it\xe2\x80\x99s imperative to turn more than half of those contests into victories.***Produce a quality lefty specialistThis is something the Orioles should have done at the beginning of the season, or when they released Brian Matusz or when Brian Duensing got hurt or when the trade deadline came and went.Orioles executive vice president Dan Duquette tried to acquire a lefty specialist in July, but the price was too hefty. Now, with versatile, right-handed set-up man Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day on the shelf, adding someone who can retire left-handers late in games becomes more of a need. You can\xc2\xa0read more about my thoughts on that in this piece.The Orioles are hoping that 25-year-old rookie Donnie Hart, a 27th round pick in 2013, can do the job; lefties are just 1-for-11 against him in five games (right-handers are 2-for-4 in the big leagues versus Hart).And maybe Hart can be the guy. But since he has never been in such high-pressure situations in the past, it certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt to add someone who has done it more often on a big stage. There\xe2\x80\x99s still a shot a lefty specialist can be acquired in a trade this month, or maybe Duquette will have to reach into his magic hat and pull out another candidate from parts unknown. But further bolstering the bullpen \xe2\x80\x93 the club\xe2\x80\x99s true strength \xe2\x80\x93 will go a long way in keeping the Orioles on the playoff path.***Dylan Bundy has started six games this season.\xc2\xa0(Photo: Tommy Gilligan, USA TODAY Sports)Get consistency from rotationThis has been the biggest concern all year. Yet since the All-Star Break, the rotation has been solid, certainly enough to put the team in position to win. But, frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s still a bit of a mystery.Chris Tillman has been exceptionally consistent and Dylan Bundy has been a savior since being inserted into the rotation. But you\xe2\x80\x99re not being fully honest if you say you know what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get from Yovani Gallardo, Kevin Gausman and Wade Miley each time on the mound.Gallardo has thrown quality starts in three of his last five outings, but the occasional, rocky five-inning performance is squarely in his portfolio. Gausman has dominant stuff, but can\xe2\x80\x99t always harness it. And Miley has been OK, good and flat-out awful in his three starts since being traded to the Orioles on July 31.Everyone wants a formidable rotation; a solid, consistent one would be enough to get the Orioles into the postseason.***Light a fire under Chris DavisIt\xe2\x80\x99s probably unfair to single out one player on this list. But this one player has been the Most Valuable Oriole two times in the past three seasons and signed a $161 million contract in the offseason.Since the All-Star Break, the offense has had its share of missteps; it\xe2\x80\x99s s not just one guy. But Chris Davis has been the poster boy for the struggles. He\xe2\x80\x99s hitting .160 with a .295 on-base percentage and .234 slugging percentage in 27 second-half games \xe2\x80\x93 and that includes a recent run in which he had three consecutive, two-hit performances. But Davis followed up that streak with six strikeouts in his last seven at-bats. He\xe2\x80\x99s struck out 162 times (and has 67 walks) in 486 plate appearances.By now, you know what you get with Davis. And, oftentimes, what you get is a big finish. In his career, he\xe2\x80\x99s best at the end of the season.

08/17/2016,"[('Orioles lose big to Red Sox, fall to third place - Camden Chat', ' Heavy rains washed away an otherwise forgettable game tonight as the Orioles were swept in their two-game series with the Red Sox and pushed down to third place for the first time this season.     Before the game was called for rain after six innings, the Orioles found themselves in a bit of a hole. Red Sox starter David Price was dominating them and Dylan Bundy was giving up hits left and right. At 9:20 the game was put into delay and mercifully put out of its misery at about 10:35. Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s Bad Night Dylan Bundy has been a revelation for the most part, but tonight he just did not have it. Maybe it was because he was moved to a new day to start when he had been preparing to pitch tomorrow. Maybe he was feeling the effects of falling and twisting his ankle in the third inning. Or maybe he just didn\xe2\x80\x99t have his good stuff because that happens on occasion.  Whatever the reason, the end result was five runs on nine hits in just 4.1 innings.     The Red Sox could have had a big inning in the second, but Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s defense bailed him out and only one run came in. With two outs and Jackie Bradley, Jr. on base after being hit by a pitch, Bundy gave up two straight singles, the second of which knocked in a run. He then walked rookie Andrew Benintendi to load the based, but Hyun Soo Kim make a nice diving catch of a sinking liner off the bat of Dustin Pedroia to end the inning.     Bundy started the third inning looking good with two quick outs of Xander Bogaerts and David Ortiz. After throwing his last pitch to Ortiz, however, Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s cleats caught in the dirt and he fell to the ground, twisting his ankle. He stayed in the game after being checked out by Richie Bancells, but sort of fell apart after that. Was it because of the ankle? Who knows; he looked bad in the second inning too.  So with two outs and no one on, Bundy walked Mookie Betts, which may not have seemed like that bad of an idea given how Betts has treated Orioles pitching. But when Bogaerts followed Betts with a home run to dead center field, it seemed less optimal.     After two singles Bundy finally got the third out, then he got through the fourth with little trouble. But in the fifth he was right back into it. He gave up another two-run homer, this one to Sandy Leon. When Brock Holt followed the dinger with a double that was it for Bundy. Tyler Wilson came in and closed out the inning.  Do we need to worry about Bundy? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Sometimes you just don\xe2\x80\x99t have it. It was rotten timing as this was a game the Orioles really needed to win. On the other hand, when you only score one run you\xe2\x80\x99re probably not going to win anyway.  The Price is Right I had high hopes for the Orioles against Price tonight I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, he\xe2\x80\x99s a very good pitcher. But they did not have a good night at all. Through the first six innings the Orioles had just five baserunners, and two reached on errors by Dustin Pedroia.     The three hits the Orioles tallied against Price came in three different innings and only one resulted in a run. That one, of course, was Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99s 25th home run of the year, a beautiful shot to Eutaw Street. Stay tuned for a new plaque!   X marks the spot. @CrushD19 #Birdland pic.twitter.com/OWIve8tVae\xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) August 18, 2016    The soft underbelly of the bullpen I mean no disrespect to Tyler Wilson and Ubaldo Jimenez, but when those two pitchers are the guys coming out of the bullpen, things are not going very well.  Wilson did a good job getting out of the fifth inning, but things turned into a big mess in the sixth. He gave up four straight hits, three of which were doubles. Naturally that resulted in three runs, but luckily for the Orioles, after Bradley hit his double he ran into an out at third.  Just as Jimenez was getting ready to start the seventh inning with the Orioles down 8-1, the tarp went on the field. The rain had been falling steadily for some time but once the lightning started the umpires shut it down  And so we waited. And it rained. There was thunder and lightning. And Ubaldo never actually got to pitch. And finally it was called.

At home, that is \xe2\x80\x93 after last night Betts has seven home runs in five games at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of unbelievable if you think about it. Is he seeing something the O\xe2\x80\x99s aren\xe2\x80\x99t, or is he just zeroed in at the plate in Baltimore? Tough to say.Yovani Gallardo\xc2\xa0got the start for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and looked fairly decent. He was hit by a comebacker in the fifth inning, but managed to stay in the game. Gallardo\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.0 IP, 4 H, 3 R, 5 BB, 2 K. Gallardo plugged through the Boston lineup until the comebacker, and until he faced Mookie Betts in the fifth inning.Betts\xe2\x80\x99 first homer came in the aforementioned fifth inning with two runners on base. Suddenly Boston led 3-0. However while Gallardo had been touched up a bit by that comebacker, it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to note that one of the baserunners had come as a result of a walk. Nothing good ever happens after a walk, right?\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireThe O\xe2\x80\x99s were unable to even draw a hit until the last of the seventh \xe2\x80\x93 and that has nothing to do with Mookie Betts, for the record. They got their first hit on a Pearce infield single which amounted to a swinging bunt. Now for the record, the O\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t violate any unwritten codes (you\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to bunt to break up a no-no). A bunt and a swinging bunt are two different things; one\xe2\x80\x99s intentional and the other not so much.Before they knew it the Orioles had the bases loaded, and\xc2\xa0Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x98 two-RBI single cut the Boston lead to 3-2. They managed to load the bases again later in the inning, and\xc2\xa0Adam Jones drew a walk which tied the game. That seventh inning gave the Orioles some momentum, however \xe2\x80\x9cBig Mo\xe2\x80\x9d as they say is apparently a tough thing to sustain when Mookie Betts is in the opposing lineup.One inning later in the eighth, Betts smacked a two-run homer to give Boston a 7-5 lead which turned into a 7-5 loss for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. As I said above, that was Betts\xe2\x80\x99 seventh home run in five games at Oriole Park this year. Now with that said, I want to make one thing clear. A lot of Orioles fans are calling for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to walk Betts intentionally as a result of these homers. While giving the guy first base is better than surrendering a home run, in my view it\xe2\x80\x99s also disrespectful of the opponent. If you aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to let the guy beat you, do it honestly.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerThat\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that you can\xe2\x80\x99t pitch Mookie Betts away or low. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to throw pitches right down Broadway for the guy. But in my personal view walking someone simply because he\xe2\x80\x99s beaten the living snot out of you is a cheap way out and it\xe2\x80\x99s unbecoming of major league baseball.\xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that the Orioles would do that, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that in my view that goes against the spirit of the game and of competition. (If the game situation warrants an IBB, that\xe2\x80\x99s a different story. But intentionally walking someone just so they don\xe2\x80\x99t hit a home run against you isn\xe2\x80\x99t the way to do things.)Buck Showalter addressed the issue of Mookie Betts after the game. He said that the issue is probably more on the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 side, but the fact is that Betts has had a great year (quote courtesy of Roch Kubatko, MASNsports):I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are some numbers to dictate that it\xe2\x80\x99s more us, but he\xe2\x80\x99s been having that type of year against most everybody. He\xe2\x80\x99s a really good player having a big year.Showalter also said that\xc2\xa0Chris Tillman is experiencing some shoulder discomfort, so he\xe2\x80\x99s being pushed from tonight back to pitching on Saturday night. The Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t appear overly concerned per se as of right now (Showalter mentioned that a lot of starting pitchers go through this type of thing at this point in the season), but their fingers are crossed Tillman will be able to go on Saturday.

There is no doubt that they are bad, but, like a plummet into a Death Star trash compactor, it could be worse. My challenge for you, in hopes that it will make you feel a little bit better, is to think about something that\'s worse than the Orioles are right now.    Then we just have to hope that the trash compactor walls don\'t start closing in. Or at least, if they do close in, that the Orioles have an astromech droid out there somewhere to stop them from being crushed. Come to think of it, maybe the O\'s are at this moment screaming into the comm-link as the walls slide ever closer. I will move on from this nerdiness now. If you missed last night\'s rain-shortened Orioles game, you are surely better off. You can and should\xc2\xa0check out the lowlights in Stacey\'s recap of the game - though there is at least one O\'s highlight. There was a new Orioles Eutaw Street home run! I like Eutaw homers. Yes, they\'re less exciting in 8-1 losses, I agree. So the Orioles are in third place right now and that\'s a lot less fun than first place... but hey, it\'s a whole lot more fun than being 30+ games out like they were on this day six years ago. In fact, that\'s my thing that\'s worse than the Orioles are right now: the 2010 Orioles.    Hopefully these links are not worse than the Orioles.

Maryland, which had rejected the amendment in February, did not ratify the amendment until 1941. Bad form, past Marylanders. In 1940, the Battle of Britain had what they simply call The Hardest Day, which was the largest aerial engagement in history at that point in time, and the costliest day in aircraft for both sides in the three month battle.

', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Don\\u2019t panic about the Orioles, unless they lose tonight ...', ' Darkness is closing in and the long night is upon us. The light of the 2016 Orioles is fading before our very eyes.    Or at least that\xe2\x80\x99s the dramatic impulse that it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely understandable to have. The recent experience for O\xe2\x80\x99s fans, say for the last 15 years, is that everything is either really, really horrible, or that everything is pretty good by the time the calendar heads towards late August. The post-All Star break time has been closer to horrible than good, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not horrible either. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, well, meh. One experience that we do not have in Orioles fan land is following a good team, not quite a great team, that comes up short against other good teams that aren\xe2\x80\x99t quite great. The AL East is a race of three flawed teams where the O\xe2\x80\x99s flaws are presently the most exposed. That\xe2\x80\x99s not as fun as the Orioles romping through the division and into the ALCS, nor as fun as if they light September on fire and claim a wild card spot. Think about it. In the 2012 season, there were no real expectations for the Orioles. They hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even really gone on their run yet. They were six games back after a win on August 18. Two years later, they were 7.5 games up on the closest competitor on this day. They might not have clinched yet, but it was obvious which way the wind was blowing.    This whole, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, they\xe2\x80\x99re only two games back, but two days ago they were tied and in first place,\xe2\x80\x9d what are we supposed to do with that? It\xe2\x80\x99s a close race. Every single development, good or bad, in a close race feels like it\xe2\x80\x99s amplified in its importance.     Lose two games against the Red Sox? It\xe2\x80\x99s a disaster! The Orioles are choking the season away! That is true. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in action and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been fun. But also: The Orioles have stunk for a month and they\xe2\x80\x99re only two games back, and they\xe2\x80\x99re still two games up for the second wild card spot! They are capable of better than this. We know they are because we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen it. All they have to do is right the ship a bit and get back on track. The AL East will be a tough battle even if they do so, but the playoffs should stay within their grasp.    This is a lot more fun than if the Orioles are 32.5 games out on this date, which they were just six years ago, shortly after Buck Showalter took over as manager. Ty Wigginton was the Orioles All-Star that year, for crying out loud. They only had the one. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad thing to be spoiled by actually having expectations. The only reason that O\xe2\x80\x99s fans are now feeling disappointment and dread is because they had the audacity to be better than everybody in the wider baseball media expected up until now. None of us would want the O\xe2\x80\x99s to switch places in the standings with the Yankees, though Yankees fans may be feeling better about how the last two weeks have gone for their team. Only after they were given up as failures did they do a little winning. Their fans can be excited because some of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Yankees are coming up and doing well.    The Orioles, on the other hand, don\xe2\x80\x99t need tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles because they\xe2\x80\x99re already pretty good. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing they don\xe2\x80\x99t need tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles anyway, because there are none.  They just need their already-good hitters to bust out of the team-wide slump they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in for a month. They might do it. They\xe2\x80\x99re good enough to do it. Are they going to do it? I have no idea! The unknown is terrifying. Hope is frightening. Only the person with hopes can have them crushed. Yet we know what the world with no hope is like. Numbness and constant misery carry the day, every day.  This is something different. In six weeks time, it could turn out to be something awesome, or before then it could be revealed to be horrible.  What if the Orioles decide to set another strikeout record when the play the Astros over the next four games? What if Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder isn\xe2\x80\x99t better after a few days rest? What if the kind of 1-12 streak that plagued them at the end of last August is still around the corner? Those are the horrible possibilities. There are good ones too. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them already this year. Remember when the Orioles ripped off seven game winning streaks in each of April, May, and June, even though their starting pitching has never been good? The Orioles averaged 6.6 runs per game in June. The players responsible for that are all still here.    The Orioles have 43 games left in which to make a comeback. They could get back into a tie within two games if everything breaks right. Or they could be out of a wild card spot in three games if everything breaks wrong. In short, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to panic about the Orioles... unless they lose tonight. Then everyone can pack everything in because the season is over.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Jose Altuve capped the surge with a two-run double with two outs to chase Miley, who matched the shortest start of his career.""It was terrible. It\'s embarrassing for that to happen,"" he said. ""I flat-out stunk.""The left-hander is 0-2 with a 9.53 ERA in four starts since being traded from Seattle on July 31.He wasn\'t the only culprit. Five Baltimore pitchers combined to give up a season-high 15 runs and 18 hits.""I know he\'s frustrated, but he\'s not the only one who struggled pitching tonight,"" manager Buck Showalter said.Altuve homered and had five RBIs to help the Astros end a five-game skid. George Springer went 4 for 5 with a home run for Houston, which also got long balls from Evan Gattis and Teoscar Hernandez.Chris Devenski (2-4) allowed one hit in four innings for the Astros after McHugh yielded seven runs and nine hits in three innings.""I don\'t know if I\'ve ever been blitzed like that before in my career,"" the right-hander said. ""Today\'s game in general was kind of a crazy.""Springer provided a glimpse of things to come by hitting a leadoff homer on the fifth pitch from Miley.After the teams traded five-run innings, Baltimore went up 7-6 in the third and Houston pulled even in the fourth.The Astros took a 9-7 lead against Ubaldo Jimenez (5-10) in the fifth. Hernandez blooped an RBI single to center and Springer greeted Tyler Wilson with a run-scoring single.Pedro Alvarez homered in the bottom half before Houston pulled away in the sixth, getting a two-run homer from Altuve and a solo shot from Gattis.Showalter doesn\'t expect this defeat to linger with his team.""Our guys turn the page very quickly, just like their team did before tonight\'s game,"" he said.Trumbo, who leads the majors with 36 homers, shrugged off the loss.""It\'s going to happen throughout the course of the year,"" he said. ""We\'ve had a lot of good times, and some not-so-good times, and this will be one of them. Everyone is this room has dealt with it many times before.

', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Orioles lose shootout to Astros, fall 15-8 with ugly ...', ' The Orioles scored a lot of runs on this particular Friday night, but the combined performances on the mound didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly help the cause in a quest to get one game closer to the top of the AL East.    The recap Orioles starter Wade Miley didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly get off to the best of starts; in fact, the first batter of the game resulted in the worst possible outcome.  After falling behind to George Springer 3-0, Miley forced a 3-1 fastball right to the center of Springer\xe2\x80\x99s bat. The leadoff man launched a home run to right-center, putting the Astros up early by a run. Brilliantly shaking off the rough start however, Miley worked his quick-paced magic to strike out the side following the solo shot. Carlos Correa, Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman  all went down swinging.    Fortunately, the bottom half of the inning belonged to the Orioles. And as an offense of their caliber is supposed to, they owned it against Houston starter Collin HcHugh.    Adam Jones led-off with a first pitch solo shot, but that was only the beginning. After he hit one over the left-field wall, the magic at Camden Yards kicked into full gear.  Hyun-Soo Kim came up next and singled, an at-bat that would ultimately be a disappointment in the grand scheme of the inning. After Kim, Manny Machado lined a hard-hit fly ball that barely snuck over the wall in center. That made it 3-0 Orioles with no outs, hardly the best part of the inning.    The duo of Chris Davis and Mark Trumbo outdid the performance of the top-third of the lineup, both launching massive home runs. Davis rocketed one of his longest HRs on a first-pitch fastball, while Trumbo(mb) took a 2-2 offering to the opposite field.  That\xe2\x80\x99s right \xe2\x80\x94 5 runs, 4 home runs, 0 outs. McHugh would eventually get out of the inning, but not before allowing another pair of singles. After the first inning, his line looked like this: 1 IP, 7 H, 5 ER, 4 HRs.  How\xe2\x80\x99s that for a first inning? Unfortunately the excitement wasn\xe2\x80\x99t over with. Miley couldn\xe2\x80\x99t shut down the Astros in the following half inning to keep the Camden Yards momentum \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even finish his second-inning work.    Given a four-run lead, the right-hander cut off any bit of momentum he might\xe2\x80\x99ve had with the first batter in the second.  After Evan Gattis singled to start the inning, the Astros strung together four more hits, including a hit batsman, to put up a whopping runs in the inning. Tyler White and Alex Bregman notched RBI doubles, cutting the Orioles lead to 5-4.  And just as Miley looked to potentially strand a pair of runners, Jose Altuve slapped a line drive to the opposite field, scoring two more to give Houston the lead. After the colossal mess, Buck Showalter had seen enough. He gave Miley the hook after 1.2 innings, in which he allowed six hits and six runs (all earned) over just 44 pitches \xe2\x80\x94 not exactly the ideal outing. Ubaldo Jimenez entered the game to a large ovation from Orioles fans (strange, yes) and ultimately captured the final out of the inning. After just an inning and a half, the Astros were on top, 6-5.    Starting in the bottom of the third, another, albeit much shorter, string of runs were put on the board by both sides.  Jonathan Schoop took advantage of a leadoff Trumbo walk to score tie things up at six, while a wild curveball in the dirt from McHugh scored another to put the Birds up, 7-6. But when Jimenez took the mound in the fourth, Houston quickly found a way to knot the game. Ubaldo consistently had trouble finding the zone, ultimately leading to the Astros\xe2\x80\x99 seventh run of the night. After a leadoff walk from Jimenez, Bregman laced a weak single to left-center to tie the ballgame yet again.  Overall, Jimenez struggled to do what he has in all of 2016: repeat a delivery and pound the zone with strikes.  In the fifth, Houston again capitalized on the mistakes of the man on the mound. Extending the inning with a walk and several lengthy at-bats, Jimenez surrendered the eighth run of the game on a bloop single in the triangle in right-center.     This time, Teoscar Hernandez was credited with the RBI \xe2\x80\x94 it put the Astros up 8-7 and chased Jimenez out of the game before the inning could end.  He\xe2\x80\x99d finish his three innings of laborious work with 52 pitches, throwing an even split of 26 balls and 26 strikes. Classically in the game of baseball, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a very good ratio. Tyler Wilson entered and allowed one of Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s baserunners to score on a single, giving the Astros a two-run advantage after their visiting at-bats in the fifth. Luckily, Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 rocket arm accounted for the third out of the inning, ending the madness. With one out in the bottom of the fifth, Pedro Alvarez joined in on the home run derby in front of the packed house at Oriole Park. He sent a first-pitch fastball from reliever Chris Devenski into the seats in right, cutting Houston\xe2\x80\x99s lead to 9-8.  C\xe2\x80\x99mon ... you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think this one was over, did you?    After five innings, there were 17 total runs scored, 20 hits sprayed around and five different pitchers to toe the rubber. How\xe2\x80\x99s that for Friday night baseball fun? For Wilson, Friday night was far from fun. It was dreadful. In a nutshell: a nightmare. When he took the hill in the top of the sixth, he had a chance to settle the Astros down to give the offense an opportunity to do their thing. But as the script of this night seemed to go, the guy pitching in orange and black completely unraveled. After allowing a leadoff single, Jose Altuve turned on, and crushed, a first-pitch fastball that caught every bit of the zone. It sailed far into the seats in left, a long way away from the catcher\xe2\x80\x99s mitt. That gave Houston a 11-8 lead, but they weren\xe2\x80\x99t done. Two batters later, Evan Gattis launched a hanging curve over the wall in left to tally another run on the board. Just like that, before Wilson could wrangle two outs, the Astros captured their biggest lead of the night.    Unfortunately, it only got worse from there. When Wilson couldn\xe2\x80\x99t settle down in the seventh, Vance Worley entered and proceeded to allow baserunner after baserunner. A walk and pair of singles led to two more runs, giving Houston a 14-8 advantage. From there, the rest of the way was quiet and uneventful. Another run crossed on Vance Worley\xe2\x80\x99s watch, but the offense couldn\xe2\x80\x99t muster anything the rest of the way. With the loss, the Orioles fall to 67-54. A Toronto loss and Boston win puts the Birds in third place, still just 1.5 games back of the division lead.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAn evening after the Baltimore Orioles pounded out 18 base hits in a 13-5 rout of the Houston Astros, they turn around and allow 18 hits in a 15-8 loss. Ridiculous.It is a good thing when you do something so awesome that it has never been done in the modern era of baseball, right? Something so great that it has not been accomplished in well over 100 years, right? Hitting four home runs before an out is registered is totally amazing, right? You\xe2\x80\x99re going to win a game like that, right?\xc2\xa0 The answers = right, right, right, WRONG!On Friday night the Orioles would get a total of five home runs on 10 hits, scoring eight runs. That should win a vast majority of baseball teams, unless your pitching is awful. And it is.So, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to dump on the pitching here today, but in doing so, let us recall that a tremendous number of games that were decently pitched this year have been lost due to a lack of run support. A number of those sorts of games account for some the O\xe2\x80\x99s nine losses in August.Particularly awful for Baltimore have been the expensive veteran pitchers the Orioles have now accumulated, like Wade Miley and Ubaldo Jimenez \xe2\x80\x93 combining last night for nine runs allowed in 4.2 innings. Here are their combined records and salaries for 2016 (along with Gallardo). You might want to sit down if you are not already doing so.$NameRecordIPERERA$alaryJimenez5-1094.2736.9413.0Gallardo4-483.1485.189.0Miley (O\xe2\x80\x99s)0-217.0189.536.167Total9-16195.01396.4228.167\xc2\xa0That graph is as horrific as it is instructive.Here in this column over the years of publication we have consistently criticized the expense and acquisition of sketchy veteran arms. Young pitchers have been traded away, and these expensive toys become a blocking pattern for development of pitchers within the system. Even so, it is not that Tyler Wilson and Mike Wright have distinguished themselves and seized opportunities. But again, maybe the lack of prior experience is yet a barrier not overcome.Let\xe2\x80\x99s find some silver linings for the Orioles right now: The Blue Jays were beaten yesterday, Chris Tillman is pitching today, and the appearance of the offense breaking out will pay off if it can be sustained.Here at the FanSided Network, we write from the fans\xe2\x80\x99 perspective. We are not beholden to the team or players, risking access by criticisms published. This team may yet win it all, but the flight so far this season is irretrievably memorable for excessive turbulence no matter how glorious the ultimate landing could be.

All to say: Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the fans be up and down emotionally? This baseball team is entirely up and down in expression and performance.

08/21/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Glaring issues with instant replay in ...', 'The Baltimore Orioles found themselves on the wrong end of another crooked game. However is there a lesson in this loss for MLB about instant replay?The Baltimore Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t drop another game by a wide margin to Houston because of instant replay last night. In fact, instant replay had nothing to do whatsoever in the outcome of the game or even it\xe2\x80\x99s ebb and flow. It was a total non-issue, if not for the fact that it (that being instant replay) was allowed to run around like a decapitulated chicken during the game.But I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to that in a moment. This game all but got out of control early on, with\xc2\xa0Chris Tillman struggling from the outset. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 2.0 IP, 6 H, 6 R, 5 BB, 0 K. There was some concern that Tillman was still struggling with his shoulder injury, however after the game he said he was fine. He merely struggled with his command, which is something that he freely admitted. So chalk it up as just a poor start.Anything that could have gone wrong for the Orioles last night did \xe2\x80\x93 as evidenced by the fact that\xc2\xa0Ryan Flaherty pitched the ninth inning. If Houston wasn\xe2\x80\x99t scoring on home runs or RBI-doubles, they were scoring on softly hit swinging bunts with the bases loaded. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that, it was a Baltimore chop (again with the bases loaded) forcing in a run. Houston seemingly moved in and made themselves at home at Oriole Park at Camden Yards without the Orioles knowing until it was too late.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireIn contrast, when the Orioles did manage to make decent contact with the ball, it was either at a Houston fielder or it was run down by one. Houston seems to have an outfield that\xe2\x80\x99s capable of covering a lot of ground, no matter what the situation. And for an Oriole team that\xe2\x80\x99s used to spraying the ball around the field, that had to be incredibly frustrating. The Orioles did score two lone runs, both off of homers.\xc2\xa0Chris Davis hit a solo shot in the fourth, and\xc2\xa0Steve Pearce followed suit in the eighth.In what was an otherwise dullard of a game, there should be a lesson however for MLB. Houston\xe2\x80\x99s Altuve led off the top of the sixth with what eventually was allowed to stand as a double. His fly ball hit off the top of the outfield wall, and was played on the fly by the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 outfield. Houston manager\xc2\xa0A.J. Hinch eventually went out to inquire about a replay review \xe2\x80\x93 thinking that the ball was a home run.The umpires huddled up and at first appeared to deny the review. Hinch persisted and seemed to refuse to be denied. After awhile, the umpires huddled again and eventually went to the headphones for an apparent replay review. The conversation was quick, and the play stood as a double \xe2\x80\x93 with Hinch still complaining about the decision, while holding an 8-1 lead.We later found out that the discussion was actually more about whether Hinch had waited too long to come out and ask for the challenge. So putting two-and-two together, I suspect that the first protestation was him inquiring about the review, and the second was him trying to convince the umpire to check the rule on how long he can wait to challenge \xe2\x80\x93 which eventually happened. Regardless of the details, the optics didn\xe2\x80\x99t really play well, and in the mean time the Oriole pitcher ended up being frozen in a sense.Buck Showalter came out of the dugout at one point seemingly ready for a fight given the fact that Hinch appeared to be arguing his way into a challenge. However when given the explanation he seemed to accept it. Instant replay is a good thing for baseball; I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that from the beginning, and I still believe that. However it needs to be fine tuned this off season. Far too often, umpires are getting their arms twisted into asking for a crew chief review by politicking managers who have the power of persuasion. That\xe2\x80\x99s not good for instant replay, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for baseball.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerIs it really fair for a game (and/or possibly a season) to hang in the balance by whether or not a skipper can diplomatically persuade an umpire to \xe2\x80\x9cindependently\xe2\x80\x9d review a play? Going back to last night, ironically that play should have had the courtesy of a review by the crew chief since it involved a potential home run. The fact is that it was botched across the board \xe2\x80\x93 by Houston\xe2\x80\x99s manager and by the umpiring crew.The idea is to get the call right. However what we saw last night was a manager who refused to take no for an answer, and the appearance that he had argued his way (twice) into a review. Obviously that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t totally the case, as the umpires called NY to check the rule on how long a manager could wait to ask for instant replay. But in the mean time, the game was delayed for over five minutes.If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to allow for the crew chief to review a play on his own, let\xe2\x80\x99s truly let that be the case. Managers should not be allowed to petition the umpires to review a play \xe2\x80\x9con his own accord.\xe2\x80\x9d So I would submit that moving forward any manager who does this should be ejected. Yes folks, you read that right; if a manager pulls the old\xc2\xa0how about you look at that on your own without me challenging it, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles make history and still manage to loseThe series with Houston concludes this afternoon, as the Birds hope to earn a split.\xc2\xa0Yovani Gallardo will be on the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Houston\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Dallas Keuchel.

08/23/2016,"[('What former Oriole could the 2016 O\\u2019s use right now ...', ' The Orioles Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations, Dan Duquette, is known for thinking outside the box. During his time in Baltimore, he has done a lot of great business, including the signings of Nelson Cruz, Nate McLouth and Steve Pearce as well as the trade for Mark Trumbo this past offseason. Of course, there have also been some decisions that came back to bite him; the biggest of which, so far, has been the trading away of eventual Cy Young winner Jake Arrieta. Ugh.    The point is, baseball deals with a lot of unknown factors. Will this guy develop? Is he injury prone? Can he handle the spotlight? Is he a head case? Yada, yada, yada. But what if we wiped all of that away and gave Duquette a fancy time machine (stay with me here). Instead of scouring the waiver wire or trade market, all he had to do was go back in Baltimore history and pluck a former star and plug him right into today\xe2\x80\x99s game. Who should he pick and why? Let\xe2\x80\x99s lay down some ground rules. In this scenario, Duquette can only pick one player. It would be great to round up all the Hall of Famers again, but that defeats the purpose of them adding to this year\xe2\x80\x99s team. It could be someone recent, like Wei-Yin Chen, or someone from the beginning of the team in the 50\xe2\x80\x99s. But, they have to of been Orioles, not St. Louis Browns. As great as George Sisler was, according to Baseball Reference, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to consider him. OK, hopefully that all makes sense. Here now are some of my picks for players that would add the most to the 2016 Orioles in no particular order. Remember, these are all independent of one another. Tell us your pick of these guys or others throughout history in the comments section.    Jim Palmer, RHP The tall, lanky, pitcher-turned-broadcaster is the obvious choice for this Orioles team. As a group, the starters have a 4.97 ERA, which puts them at 26th in MLB. Palmer\xe2\x80\x99s career 2.86 ERA would look pretty great in place of someone like Wade Miley. Not to mention Cakes was a horse, averaging 249 innings per 162-game season. Simply put, he is the best pitcher in team history and would be a welcome addition.    Mike Mussina, RHP If we look at statistics, Moose was not as dominant as Palmer, who came a generation before him. And his stand-offish demeanor may not have earned him many fans along the way, but this guy was a phenomenal pitcher. The righty\xe2\x80\x99s career 3.68 ERA doesn\xe2\x80\x99t scream \xe2\x80\x9cincredible\xe2\x80\x9d, but his career 123 ERA+ is just two points lower than the Hall-of-Famer Palmer. And you have to remember that Mussina pitched through the entire \xe2\x80\x9cSteroid Era\xe2\x80\x9d, which may have inflated his numbers some. Slot him in against today\xe2\x80\x99s offenses and he would be an impact arm again. Eddie Murray, 1B Chris Davis has not been a bad first baseman this year, but he could stand to be a lot better. Murray was one of the best at the position in baseball history and he had his best years in Baltimore. While an Oriole, he slashed .294/.370/.498 and had a 56.3 WAR over 13 seasons and played Gold Glove defense. Murray\xe2\x80\x99s addition would lengthen the lineup and take some pressure off of Crush, who moves to DH in this scenario.    Brady Anderson, OF Man, that 1996 season! A slash line of .297/.396/.637 with 50 home runs and 110 RBI? Yeah, that would slot in somewhere on this team. As would Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s overall athleticism, which is something the Orioles seem to lack at times. Although manager Buck Showalter may not use it much, Brady was a good base stealer, leading Orioles history with 507 swiped bags. Adam Jones probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let the center field spot slipe, but Anderson is a team player. He takes over for either Hyun Soo Kim in left or Trumbo in right to provide better defense. Melvin Mora, UTL I grew up in the dark ages of Orioles baseball. They made the playoffs in 1997, when I was four years old and not paying attention to baseball yet, and then never made it again until 2012, when I was a sophomore in college. During that stretch, Mora was one of my favorites, so this is a bit of a homer pick, but if this was the 2004-version of Mora, he would be quite the addition. That year, he slashed .340/.419/.562 with 27 home runs and 104 RBI. While he eventually became exclusively a third baseman, he had the ability to play all over the field. If he was the pick, the O\xe2\x80\x99s would send Ryan Flaherty back to Norfolk and use Mora as the everyday utility man. Jake Arrieta, RHP It\xe2\x80\x99s not meant to twist the knife anymore, but the modern version of Arrieta would be PERFECT for this 2016 squad. While he has not been quite as dominant this season as he was last summer, he is still pretty darn great. That 2.75 ERA, 15-5 record and 147 ERA+ is going to earn him some Cy Young consideration again. Meanwhile, the O\xe2\x80\x99s rotation is a mess. The advantage that Arrieta has over Palmer or Mussina is that he is performing right now, in this era. Would Moose or Cakes translate from their time? I think they would, but it is open for discussion. The problem, he stunk as an Oriole and returning to Baltimore may cause him issues.    The verdict If I had to pick just one guy from O\xe2\x80\x99s history, I\xe2\x80\x99m going with Palmer by a good margin. Judging based off of both stats and how he speaks during MASN broadcasts, the guy knows pitching inside and out. His game is as much cerebral as it is physical and that would be a nice addition to both the field and the clubhouse, teaching a guy like Dylan Bundy the nuances of the game. I\xe2\x80\x99m for Cakes all the way. Of course, I left off legends like Frank Robinson, Cal Ripken Jr. and Brooks Robinson. My reasoning: they didn\xe2\x80\x99t fill a need as much as others, and this would have been a boring article if all I did was list the Hall-of-Famers for you. However, you can certainly pick them if you so choose. Thanks for reading! Who would be your pick? As mentioned before, it can be one of the players listed above or any other Oriole in history that you prefer. Let us know in the comments or on Twitter and Facebook.

We speculated in the latest episode of our podcast that something is wrong with Tillman and a trip to the disabled list might be the best move. The news today makes it seem like that could be a possibility.Tillman never looked right when he took the mound Saturday against the Houston Astros. He gave up six runs and walked five batters in just two innings. He allowed a home run and hit a batter on a disastrous night for the pitching staff that ended with Ryan Flaherty pitching the ninth inning.Showalter now must figure out who will take Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s place on the rubber on Thursday. The two options on the roster are Ubaldo Jimenez and Vance Worley. They also could opt to bring Tyler Wilson or Mike Wright from the minors. None of the aforementioned names are close to the same level as Tillman.Tillman was in the Cy Young discussion for much of the season, but his last five starts have been dreadful. He has a 6.66 ERA and batters are hitting .314 in those five appearances.

08/24/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: In memory of the great Mike Flanagan', 'On this date five years ago in 2011, the great Mike Flanagan of the Baltimore Orioles was taken from this world. We remember him today and always.August 24th is a date that Baltimore Orioles fans will probably not soon forget, as it\xe2\x80\x99s the day that the great\xc2\xa0Mike Flanagan passed away in 2011. Few fans will soon forget the events of that night; the O\xe2\x80\x99s were getting set to play a game in Minnesota, and just prior to the game reports surfaced of a body being found on Flanagan\xe2\x80\x99s Baltimore County property. That body turned out to be that of Mike Flanagan himself.That night I vowed to write a tribute in some manner to Flanagan as long as I have this \xe2\x80\x9cbully pulpit\xe2\x80\x9d at my disposal. Needless to say, it was a hard time for the entire Orioles community.

Not to mention the rest of the MASN crew.Flanagan was a beloved member of the Orioles during his entire career.

Despite his New England roots, Flanagan represented Baltimore and the Oriole Way as well as anyone could. He was a blue collar family guy who engrossed himself in this community and learned it\xe2\x80\x99s ways quickly. And he was beloved for it.His kids went to school with your kids, he ate dinner in the same restaurants as you did, and he was simply put just a member of the community. Flanagan of course is also remembered for his quick wit and quirky one-liners, which is another thing that endeared him to throngs of Orioles fans. Aside from being a World Series champion and a Cy Young award winner, he\xe2\x80\x99s probably best remembered as being the last Oriole pitcher to stand on the mound at Memorial Stadium. That was a fitting way at that moment for the Orioles to tie together past, present, and future.\xc2\xa0More from History12/4 - Baltimore Orioles: Top ten pitchers in franchise history5/31 - Baltimore Orioles: Buck Showalter All-Time Team2/15 - Best of the Best: Shortstops2/5 - Best of the Best: Right Fielders1/28 - Best of the Best: Third BasemenSpeaking for myself, Flanagan was an Oriole star and then later a broadcaster, coach, GM, and then a broadcaster again. However more importantly he was a man that had a family. It\xe2\x80\x99s so easy to say that Baltimore lost an icon five years ago today, and it did.

08/25/2016,"[(""Baltimore Orioles: Can you root for the O's and the ..."", 'Is it right or wrong to have two teams? Can fans of the mid-Atlantic region justifiably root for both the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals?The Baltimore Orioles haven\xe2\x80\x99t been alone in the mid-Atlantic region since 2005 when the Washington Nationals moved into the area. One year later, the two teams began playing the \xe2\x80\x9cBattle of the Beltways\xe2\x80\x9d each year. At first each team would visit the other over a three-game weekend series. However of late MLB has gone to a format in which each team visits the other twice over a four-day span \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s true of all regional rivalries now.If you go to New York, you\xe2\x80\x99re either a Yankees or Mets fan. The same is true in Chicago with the ChiSox and Cubs, as well as in Los Angeles with the Angels and Dodgers. Neither side seems to really care for the other, however what they both do seem to agree on is that \xe2\x80\x9chybrid fans\xe2\x80\x9d who claim to love both teams are\xc2\xa0personae non gratae. In other words, you have to pick one!As I look\xc2\xa0down over Nationals Park to ready myself for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game, it dawns on me that the series between the Orioles and Washington isn\xe2\x80\x99t as comparable to those others as one might think. All of those rivalries are in the same city as opposed to Baltimore and Washington being two distinct cities with distinct cultures. Granted the two parks are separated by only about 30 miles, but they\xe2\x80\x99re vastly different places.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireBut the idea here isn\xe2\x80\x99t to talk about what makes the cities and teams different or the same. But unlike in the aforementioned places, we do see folks at Beltway Series games with the split hats/shirts, or the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 shirt and Washington hat. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t something you\xe2\x80\x99d ever see in NY or Chicago, but we see it here. Is that okay?Like the region it seems, my answer is split\xe2\x80\xa6! Or rather, let\xe2\x80\x99s say there\xe2\x80\x99s a qualifier on the first part. It is in fact \xe2\x80\x9cokay\xe2\x80\x9d to feel that way and to root for both teams with equal fervor,\xc2\xa0if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you have to do to stay into baseball. The whole idea if for the sport itself to continue to thrive as America\xe2\x80\x99s pastime. So if split loyalties are what you have to do to stay focused on the game, go for it.However in reality, I would argue that it\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0NOT\xc2\xa0okay. You pick one team as a kid or whenever you start following a sport. Now if another team moves closer to where you live or something along those lines, I would say that it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to cease rooting for the one team and start rooting for the other. Does that mean you can\xe2\x80\x99t follow the first team at all? Not necessarily \xe2\x80\x93 but the point is that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be with the same fervor. (Incidentally, for the most part I\xe2\x80\x99m not into people thinking it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to even cease being a fan of a team for one reason or another. But a team moving closer to you is one exception to that.)\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerIn Washington\xe2\x80\x99s case, there are a lot of Orioles fans due in part to the fact that DC went 34 years without a team. However there\xe2\x80\x99s also the proximity factor as well. But I would argue that it goes well beyond just the Orioles. I\xe2\x80\x99ve met lots of people in the DC area who grew up rooting for other teams all together (Red Sox, Yankees, Cubs, etc), but who now claim they still have that initial loyalty \xe2\x80\x93 while having the same amount of loyalty to the Nationals. Again, whatever makes you happy I suppose. But you\xe2\x80\x99d never see this in places like NY or Chicago. Fans on both sides would gang up on someone with a split shirt or cap!Incidentally, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a reflection on Washington fans or anything along those lines \xe2\x80\x93 I can already see the throngs of seething Nationals fans lining up to complain about a Baltimore writer targeting them. There\xe2\x80\x99s still a novelty of sorts with baseball in DC. The kids who are growing up going to Nationals Park now are the ones who will carry that tradition onward. The city didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a team for a long time \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s natural that it would be tough for people to figure out what they want to do at a certain point.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles hold on for dear life to earn a curly W in DCThe Orioles were Washington\xe2\x80\x99s de facto team for some time. But if you grew up a Cubs fan, it might be hard to shove that aside and start rooting for the Nats. Nevertheless, the point is that as opposed to saying\xc2\xa0since I like both teams equally I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be happy no matter who wins\xe2\x80\xa6yay!, you should pick one team and stick with them. But if ardently following two teams and living and dying with them keeps you involved in baseball, go for it. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

He will sit in the left-field bullpen and wait for his chance to close out a victory, and no fans will think about Mariano Rivera. But they should.Britton is a left-handed visitor who has never closed out a World Series, so he is unlike Rivera in the obvious ways. Yet in his manner of dominating the late innings, Britton is probably the closest thing to Rivera since Rivera retired in 2013. He does it all with one devastating pitch.For Britton, the pitch is the sinker, a 96-mile-per-hour anvil that hitters simply cannot lift. According to Fangraphs, Britton\xe2\x80\x99s ground-ball rate (79.7 percent) is by far the best in the majors \xe2\x80\x94 a full 15 percentage points better than the next-closest pitcher with at least 50 innings, Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Brad Ziegler.Britton throws the sinker almost all the time. Like Rivera, the master of the cutter, he stymies opponents with a pitch they know is coming but simply cannot handle.

Privacy Policy     Two years ago, Nitkowski had Britton as a guest on the radio. Britton explained the origins of his sinker, and Nitkowski, a former major league reliever, was struck by the happy accident that had produced such a powerful weapon.Britton was pitching in the low minors in 2007, his first full year as a professional, when his coach, Calvin Maduro, tried to teach him a cutter. Maduro, a former Orioles pitcher, showed Britton an unconventional curveball-like grip that sometimes works for the cutter. Britton tried it and the pitch moved hard and down \xe2\x80\x94 but away from a right-hander, not in, the way his cutter should move.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Maduro was dumbfounded, but he told Britton not to change a thing. Over time, Britton learned to manipulate the grip and make the ball cut when he wants to. But he still throws his power sinker the wrong way.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cPitching\xe2\x80\x99s so weird, because everyone\xe2\x80\x99s arm action is different,\xe2\x80\x9d Britton said, retelling the story by his locker at Camden Yards last summer. \xe2\x80\x9cEven though it may look the same, it\xe2\x80\x99s different. Their bodies are different. The way they put pressure on the ball is different. That grip is a good sinker for me. If I gripped it like a two-seamer, it probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even move.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Britton spent parts of three seasons as a starter, from 2011 to 2013. He was mediocre (a 4.86 earned run average) and too wild. He needed to command the sinker, and during spring training in 2014, he learned to do it by throwing to a strike zone constructed with strings.The pitching coach Dave Wallace \xe2\x80\x94 who knew of the device from his days with the Dodgers \xe2\x80\x94 moved the knots within the strings to an area about six inches on each side, low and away. If a pitcher can get the ball there consistently, Wallace believes, everything else will be easy by comparison. He has another name for his tiny zone: a quality major league strike.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cWe usually give a guy 20 throws, and a lot of guys don\xe2\x80\x99t get 10,\xe2\x80\x9d Wallace said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what you find out is if they get eight, there\xe2\x80\x99s another five or six that are real close, because of the level of concentration.\xe2\x80\x9d Photo       Mariano Rivera, who retired from the Yankees in 2013, had a skill in common with Zach Britton: his domination of late innings.  Credit             Rob Carr/Getty Images           For Britton, it was a revelation. Visualization, he found, was everything. Soon enough, he was threading his sinker through the strings on about seven out of 10 tries. He took the pitch into games, and hitters used to getting ahead of him were suddenly behind in the count. That made them vulnerable to his sinker off the plate, and Britton knew how to get it there.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  If Britton wanted to throw the sinker for a strike, he would aim it at the Under Armour symbol on his catcher\xe2\x80\x99s chest protector, just below the neck, and the movement would take it into the zone. If he wanted to throw the pitch for a ball, he would aim it at the catcher\xe2\x80\x99s shin guards and the movement would carry it to the dirt. The strings had taught him how his sinker should behave.\xe2\x80\x9cThat drill really helped me understand what my pitch is actually doing,\xe2\x80\x9d Britton said.Britton allowed an earned run on Wednesday for the first time since April 30. But he still finished up an Orioles victory and has converted all 38 save opportunities this season \xe2\x80\x94 plus one in the All-Star Game, when he got the Colorado slugger Nolan Arenado to beat a sinker into the ground for a game-ending double play.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Before Britton, no major league left-hander had converted 38 saves in a row. No reliever has won the Cy Young Award since Eric Gagne of the Los Angeles Dodgers, in 2003, but Britton is building a case.Several American League starters have pitched very well this season \xe2\x80\x94 Texas\xe2\x80\x99 Cole Hamels, Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s Corey Kluber, Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Sale, Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s J. A. Happ \xe2\x80\x94 but none has separated himself the way Britton has among relievers.The workload between starters and relievers is hardly comparable. While Britton pitches almost exclusively in high-leverage situations, he has faced about 500 fewer hitters than Hamels. But it is hard to argue that anyone has done his job better than Britton, whose E.R.A. is 0.69. None of the nine relievers to win the Cy Young had an E.R.A. that low.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Rivera never won the Cy Young Award, but he also never had a regular season quite like Britton\xe2\x80\x99s. Few, if any, relievers ever have.

Since Peter Angelos named him the new man in charge, all this team has done is win ball games.Much of that is because he has put together the right team and manages it to perfection. There are not many nights where you wonder what the hell he is doing.Last night was one of those rare nights.There was plenty of decisions that made you scratch your head. It started with the decision to start Steve Pearce over Hyun-Soo Kim against a right hander. Kim has been one of the O\xe2\x80\x99s best hitters this season, but Showalter decided to put Pearce in the lineup to get him at bats. The result? Pearce went 0-4 with a strikeout.Pearce has been a major disappointment since coming back to the Orioles in a deadline deal. He\xe2\x80\x99s batting .172. with eight strikeouts in 29 at bats. We know Pearce is one of Buck\xe2\x80\x99s guys, but he is a liability at this point.Ubaldo Jimenez pitched a gem last night. You read that right. Ubaldo Jimenez was great. He pitched six innings of one-run baseball and gave his team a chance to win. That is something we haven\xe2\x80\x99t said much about a Jimenez start.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoShowalter made the right move to get him out of the game after six. It\xe2\x80\x99s who he put in to replace him that has us wondering what he was thinking.It was a 1-0 game with Brad Brach warming in the pen to keep the game close. Yet, for some unknown reason, Logan Ondrusek entered the game instead. He worked a scoreless seventh which was a shocker given how ineffective he has been. So Buck left him out there for another inning and it was a three-run inning that put the game out of reach.The game was still in reach and he left a pitcher that has been downright awful work another inning instead of putting his All Star in the game. Why? It\xe2\x80\x99s a decision most Orioles fans did not understand.Some say it did not matter because the Orioles never scored a run. However, there is a difference between trying to score one run instead of four. They could have approached the ninth with a completely different strategy.These are the kinds of mistakes the Orioles cannot make at this point of the season. The pitching is already a mess with Chris Tillman and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day on the disabled list. Kim got one at bat last night and it resulted in a double. Granted it was not against Max Scherzer, who was fantastic last night, but their closer Mark Melancon is no slouch.The guys on the field are supposed to win the game. Buck did not strike out ten times, but he did not put his team in a position to win either. When\xc2\xa0Jimenez is going to pitch his best game of the season, you have to do everything possible to win that game. It is unlikely we get another performance like that from him.Even with the loss, the Orioles won the series against the Nationals. The teams above them in the American League East also lost last night so they lost no ground there. They now head to the Bronx for a three-game set against the New York Yankees and have nine more divisional games after that.Next: Prepare for Rollercoaster Ride the Rest of the WayNow is not the time to be throwing opportunities away. It is not often that Buck is to blame for a loss, but this one is on him.

And in saying that, I mean people thought it would be a beat down. JImenez obviously has struggled this year, so perhaps people thought that with good reason.The Birds did end up falling last night. However no matter how you want to spin the game, Jimenez was very good last night in place of the injured Tillman. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.0 IP, 5 H, 1 R, 0 BB, 4 K. Jimenez made one bad pitch: he left a fastball up in the zone to Werth in the fourth inning. Werth being a great hitter, jumped on that and smacked it over the wall giving Washington a 1-0 lead.But I can\xe2\x80\x99t stress enough that Ubaldo Jimenez was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 best chance to win last night\xe2\x80\x99s game. If you\xe2\x80\x99re in a situation where if you do make one bad pitch you\xe2\x80\x99re going to lose, then\xe2\x80\xa6well, odds are you\xe2\x80\x99re going to lose. The Orioles were stymied all night by Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Scherzer, who allowed barely any baserunners over the course of his eight innings.

As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times, good pitching will usually shut down good hitting.That 1-0 lead held up all night, which was fine with Washington because they allowed nary a run. They also added to their lead in the last of the eighth on a Murphy RBI-double, and a two-RBI double by Harper.

After the game Jimenez addressed the fact that he felt very good out there, and that he was able to mix his pitches well during the game (quote courtesy of Roch Kubatko, MASN sports):It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while since I\xe2\x80\x99ve started. I felt good. I was able to command the fastball, throw the breaking ball behind the count. Everything was good.Jimenez has been much maligned by the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fanbase this year, and in many cases justifiably so. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been good. But he was the lone bright spot for an Orioles team last night who luckily for them didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose any ground due to Boston and Toronto falling.The Orioles pinch-hit for\xc2\xa0Adam Jones in the top of the ninth, and we later found out that he had cramped up late in the game.

And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, the word \xe2\x80\x9chorrible\xe2\x80\x9d is thrown around a lot, including by myself, when it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not that severe of a situation. So I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for exaggerating in the past. But this was horrible.     Like \xe2\x80\x9cgiving up a home run to Aaron Hicks\xe2\x80\x9d horrible. \xe2\x80\x9cBlowing a double steal to let a run score\xe2\x80\x9d horrible. \xe2\x80\x9cMychal Givens had to pitch in the fifth inning\xe2\x80\x9d horrible. \xe2\x80\x9cMatt Wieters doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to call pitches on an 0-2 count\xe2\x80\x9d horrible.    Jim Palmer - who is not at all horrible - has run out of patience with several Orioles, including Wieters. Palmer wondered, repeatedly, why there were so many high fastballs being called on two-strike counts when Bundy was fooling Yankees batters with his breaking pitches. Why, indeed? Palmer also repeatedly referenced the fact that T.J. McFarland was rushed back to the big leagues in desperation, despite his minor league rehab not going particularly well, all for the Orioles to, hopefully, get a few innings out of him. Bundy only pitched four innings, for a variety of reasons, some of which weren\xe2\x80\x99t his fault, and then McFarland was called upon.    And by the way, McFarland was not called upon in a lost cause of a game. Bundy gave up five runs in four innings, true, which sure isn\xe2\x80\x99t great, and is enough to get us all wondering and worrying if the O\xe2\x80\x99s are hurting Bundy with this late-season use.  But by the time McFarland stepped onto the mound, the Orioles were \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d losing 5-4, thanks to two Chris Davis home runs and a Mark Trumbo home run. The Orioles are never out of a game where their pitching staff can keep them remotely close! That\xe2\x80\x99s the trick, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it. So, McFarland. Look, Palmer said it all already. McFarland got rushed here and maybe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong here. He definitely gave up two home runs in the span of facing six batters in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game, and was generally so pathetic that despite the fact that the Orioles desperately needed multiple innings from McFarland, just to eat the innings and move on, he was so bad that Buck Showalter was forced to pull him from the game. The Orioles trailed 9-4 by the time he left.    This is a cascading failure for the Orioles. Now Givens was forced to be deployed in the fifth inning, and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good today either, so he threw 28 pitches and only got one out, which will affect him for the rest of the series (if the Orioles should happen to have a lead) and beyond.  Donnie Hart was also needed in the game, before the sixth inning even finished, for 36 pitches. Brad Brach had to pitch for more than an inning in a game where he entered with the Orioles trailing by eight runs. The \xe2\x80\x9clong\xe2\x80\x9d reliever revolving door will surely keep spinning another day. In short, the Orioles are riding the disaster bus right now.         The Orioles disaster bus Mark Brown / Camden Chat   The Orioles have now given up at least 12 runs in four of their last nine games. They have given up 139 runs in 25 August games - 5.56 runs allowed per game. Their starting pitcher ERA is now over 5.00 for the season. The bullpen ERA, once a strength of the team, is now closer to 4 than it is to 3. They have three players with 30+ home runs and this fact almost doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even matter. We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the East and second place. Jones and Tillman and O\xe2\x80\x99Day fell there. First place went 11 days ago. The home runs are over the wall in right field. Gary Sanchez keeps hitting homers. We cannot get out. The end comes. Drums, drums in the deep. They are coming...  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles at New York Yankees - USA Today', 'NEW YORK -- Standing in front of his locker in the corner of the massive New York Yankees clubhouse  Gary Sanchez spoke modestly and quietly about the latest big night of what has become a dream start to a career. Sanchez did not need to make noise with his words to a group of about 25 reporters. His bat did it for him. Sanchez became the third player to get 10 home runs in his first 22 games Friday night when he highlighted a three-hit night with a long two-run home run and the Yankees rolled to a 14-4 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. ""I\'m trying to just put a good swing on the ball "" Sanchez said through an interpreter. ""That\'s the mindset I have and good things are happening."" Sanchez fell a triple shy of his cycle when he flied out in the seventh  but before his final at-bat  the rookie catcher singled and a had a two-run double during New York\'s six-run second inning. The Yankees had a 10-1 lead when Sanchez stepped in for his fourth at-bat  and when he drove a 1-0 pitch from Vance Worley into the left-field seats  he heard fans chanting his name as he rounded the bases. ""It\'s as good as I\'ve seen to start a career "" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. Sanchez joined Trevor Story and George Scott (1966  Boston Red Sox) as the only players to get double-digit home runs in their first 22 games. Eight of those have been in his last nine games  and in his last 10 games he is 20-for-37 (.541). His 20 RBIs through 22 games are the third-most in Yankees history only behind Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio (22) and Hideki Matsui (21). No wonder people are running out of things to say about a player fans have anticipated for the last few years. ""Yeah I think so "" said Girardi when asked if he has run out of adjectives to describe Sanchez\'s performances. ""He continues to just swing the bat extremely well. He seems to center every baseball he hits. He\'s patient. He gets his pitch and he\'s not missing it right now."" Sanchez finished New York\'s fifth win in seven games and 13th in 21 games since he was promoted on Aug. 3 by getting three hits for the fifth time. Only Bob Meusel and Joe DiMaggio had six three-hit games within their first 22 games.  With five games remaining in August  Sanchez also has the Yankees rookie record for home runs in a month and the most since Alfonso Soriano hit 13 in August 2013. He also is the first Yankee to record multiple hits and a home run in three straight games at the current Yankee Stadium. ""He\'s as hot as it gets right now and we\'re all having a good time watching him "" Yankees left fielder Brett Gardner said. It was a fun night all around for the Yankees  who are 3 1/2 games behind Baltimore for the second wild -spot. New York had its second-most runs and hits of the season and scored at least five runs for the ninth time in 13 games. All nine starters had a hit  seven collected multiple hits and the Yankees were 7-for-10 with runners in scoring position. Besides Sanchez\'s four RBIs  Mark Teixeira drove in three runs with a two-run home run in the first off Yovani Gallardo (4-6) and an RBI single during a six-run second inning. Gardner also drove in three runs with two run-scoring singles while Jacoby Ellsbury had an RBI single. Ronald Torreyes added an RBI double during the Yankees\' six-run second inning that was aided by Nolan Reimold\'s error. Chase Headley contributed a two-run home run. Yankees rookie right-hander Luis Cessa allowed two home runs to Manny Machado among five hits in six innings in his second career start. But Cessa was caught up in the Sanchez\'s output as well. ""Right now Sanchez is amazing "" Cessa said. Things were not so amazing for the Orioles  who lost for the seventh time in 11 games and 11th straight series opener in New York. Machado had his ninth career multi-homer game and Jonathan Schoop had a late RBI single  but little else went right for the Orioles. Gallardo had the shortest start of his 10-year career  allowing eight runs (seven earned) and six hits in 1 1/3 innings. Worley wasn\'t much better  allowing four runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings  and the Orioles finished the game with a team ERA of 4.45 after allowing at least eight runs for the fourth time in the last eight games. ""Just up and wild in the strike zone and up "" Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. ""Never really got any sequences going."" Making matters worse for Baltimore was Adam Jones left the game after the second inning with a strained left hamstring and his replacement in center field made the error ahead of the big inning by the Yankees. ""It (stinks) "" Jones said. ""I feel like I let my team down."" NOTES: C/DH Brian McCann was not with the Yankees because his grandmother passed away. McCann was not placed on the bereavement list and manager Joe Girardi is uncertain if he will be available Saturday. ... Baltimore activated LHP T.J.

McFarland reacts during the fifth inning of a baseball game against the New York Yankees on Saturday, Aug. 27, 2016, in New York. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORENEW YORK (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 With his team\'s grip on the second AL wild-card spot slipping, Baltimore manager Buck Showalter hoped Dylan Bundy could pitch well and give the suddenly struggling bullpen a break.In his ninth major league start, Bundy wasn\'t able to help the Orioles with either task.Bundy was tagged for five runs in just four innings as the New York Yankees routed the Orioles 13-5 on Saturday.Chris Davis homered twice and Mark Trumbo hit his big league-leading 39th home run for Baltimore, which lost its third in row. New York won its fourth straight to pull within 2 1/2 games for the last wild-card slot.Starting for the first time against New York, Bundy (7-5) struggled from the first pitch. He walked his second batter, setting up Mark Teixeira\'s RBI double.""Anytime you can\'t get through five or six innings it\'s not a quality start and I didn\'t give my team a very good chance to win today,"" Bundy said. ""That\'s my fault and I got to get better next time.""A day after a 14-4 trouncing in which Yovani Gallardo lasted only 1 1/3 innings in the shortest start of his 10-year career, Bundy also came out early.""He\'s pitched well and just could never really get into that rhythm,"" Showalter said.Orioles relievers T.J. McFarland, Mychal Givens, Donnie Hart and Brad Brach combined to give up eight runs in four innings. An early strength of the team, the bullpen has struggled of late, allowing 23 runs over the last four games.""That\'s what happens,"" Showalter said. ""That\'s why they call it dog days of August. It happens to pitchers, hitters, everybody.""The homers by Davis and Trumbo brought Baltimore\'s season total to 202 in 129 games, the fifth consecutive season with at least 200 homers. The 129 games needed to reach the mark are the second-fewest to reach 200 home runs in Orioles history, STATS said.Yankees rookie Gary Sanchez homered for the 11th time in 21 games this season. Starlin Castro and Aaron Hicks also connected.New York had 18 hits and drew seven walks on the afternoon, but despite all that offensive output, it was a disputed play on the bases that put them ahead for good.After Davis\' first homer gave the Orioles a 2-1 lead in the third, two-out singles by Teixeira, Didi Gregorius and Castro brought home the tying run.With runners at the corners, Castro broke for second. Catcher Matt Wieters\' throw was then cut off by shortstop J.J. Hardy as Gregorius tried to steal home.Hardy\'s throw appeared to be in time, but Gregorius neatly tucked in his right arm and extended his left arm across home plate.Umpire Ron Kulpa called Gregorius out, but the Yankees challenged and the ruling was overturned. After the review, Brian McCann hit an RBI double for a 4-2 lead.""I thought I probably missed on the first hand,"" Wieters said. ""It was close on the first hand before he pulled it back. And then I knew I got him on the chest area, but didn\'t know if he got his right hand in in time. It was close and it didn\'t go our way.""TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: CF Adam Jones was held out of the lineup after aggravating his hamstring injury on Friday. He tried to talk his way into starting, Showalter said.UP NEXTOrioles: RHP Kevin Gausman (5-10, 3.92 ERA) is set to make his fourth start this season against the Yankees. He\'s 0-1 in the previous three outings despite a 1.31 ERA.Yankees: LHP CC Sabathia (8-10, 4.33) was originally scheduled to pitch Monday in Kansas City. But Girardi made a switch, starting Sabathia instead of RHP Michael Pineda. Girardi cited Baltimore\'s better numbers against right-handed pitching and the Royals\' success vs. lefties.JERSEY BOYOrioles All-Star reliever Brad Brach will be inducted into the Monmouth University Athletics Hall of Fame in December. He will join Miles Austin III (football) as the newest members of the 2016 class. A native of Freehold, New Jersey, Brach remains the school\'s all-time leader in wins (29), strikeouts (277), and innings pitched (324 1-3).

He will regress into the promising player he was assumed to be when the Yankees called him up this month, rather than the dominant force he has become since joining them. Sanchez will, most likely, stop hitting like Barry Bonds in pinstripes.That day, however, has not come just yet. Instead, Sanchez, 23, remains on his torrid streak. His debut month has been one for history, and it only got better Saturday. He hit another home run, his 11th this month, in the fourth inning of the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 13-5 home victory over the Baltimore Orioles.Unlike his previous home runs, it was no moonshot, just a defensive swing with two strikes that sent a 94-mile-per-hour fastball from Dylan Bundy skimming over the right-field wall. It was one of six homers in the game, but the only one to bring on a curtain call, with the fans at Yankee Stadium chanting Sanchez\xe2\x80\x99s name for a second straight day.It continued a remarkable stretch for Sanchez, and the Yankees. After going without a home run in his first 27 major league plate appearances this year, he has hit 11 in his last 63 appearances and nine in his last 10 games. He now has more homers with the Yankees than he hit in four months in Class AAA, and he has reached that total faster than any player in major league history.

They have scored 27 runs in two games against the Orioles and piled up 18 hits in each one. Starlin Castro had four hits, including his 18th homer of the year, and three runs batted in.Their victory over their American League East rivals lifted the Yankees to two and a half games behind Baltimore for the final A.L. postseason spot, though they were separated by two other teams. The Yankees are a season-high six games over .500 and have been on an upswing since completing three major deals before the trade deadline that were widely perceived as a decision to put aside serious playoff hopes for 2016 and look to rebuilding for the future.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you think when they trade Beltran, Miller and Chapman,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad Green, the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 starting pitcher Saturday, said of Carlos Beltran, Andrew Miller and Aroldis Chapman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think they\xe2\x80\x99re giving up, but we still have great players in here.\xe2\x80\x9d Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

He signed with the Yankees at age 16 out of the Dominican Republic, earning a $3 million signing bonus that was then the largest the Yankees had ever paid to an amateur international free agent.

Although he made his debut in the majors on the second-to-last day of the 2015 season, he did not gain a starting job until the organization promoted him on Aug. 2. Since then, he has been a challenging matchup for opposing pitchers.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Still, the Yankees have seen this before, or at least a close approximation. Twenty-six years ago, Kevin Maas made his debut for the club and hit 10 homers in his first 79 at-bats. Buck Showalter, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 manager and a coach on the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 staff in 1990, thought of him Friday night as he watched Sanchez.\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened to Kevin?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked before the game Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did that work out?\xe2\x80\x9dMaas turned out to be a supernova. He was promoted to the Yankees at 25 and never played a game in the majors after 30. He hit just 55 more homers, and his career wound down with stops in the minor leagues and in Japan.Sanchez, however, comes with a more significant pedigree. While his power is evident, his defensive skills as a catcher and his strong arm \xe2\x80\x94 he has thrown out six of the nine base runners who have tried to steal on his watch \xe2\x80\x94 have drawn praise from, among others, Showalter, who also warned against placing high expectations on a young player.

Just let him be.

The Orioles have lost six of their past nine games and have fallen into a funk this month that has cost them the lead in the A.L. East. Now the Yankees are among the teams nipping at their heels for the final playoff berth.The Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 offense has been revived in that time, turning a yawning, aging lineup into a formidable one despite the loss of Beltran, their lone offensive All-Star.

Division rival New York did just that last month for the first time in\xe2\x80\xa6possibly recorded history. They got rid of some dead weight on their roster and traded for youth.

However NY challenge the call \xe2\x80\x93 and despite what appeared NOT to be clear evidence to overturn the call on the field, Gregorious was called safe at home plate and NY took the lead back.It has to be frustrating for an Oriole team to find themselves in a situation like that, after seeing so many calls upheld against them with seemingly little video evidence.

The Orioles need to find some way to beat NY\xe2\x80\x99s youthful enthusism back down so as to restore common sense and order.That may come off as somewhat harsh I suppose. However the point is that New York is turning things on their side from the perspective of the Orioles. Once you sell you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to re-build from the bottom. You sell with the idea of being good down the road. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not how it\xe2\x80\x99s working out thus far.

08/29/2016,"[('Orioles offense can\\u2019t get started against Jays in 5-1 loss ...', ' Not many baseball teams are going to win many games where they only pick up four hits. That\xe2\x80\x99s how the Orioles opened up their late August series against the Blue Jays in Baltimore on Monday night, dropping a 5-1 decision to increase the O\xe2\x80\x99s deficit in the AL East to four games.    The lack of offense meant that the Orioles ended up wasting what was possibly the best start that Wade Miley has made since being traded to the Orioles. Miley was no slouch himself in the game, giving up just five hits over the seven innings he worked. Yes, the Orioles just pulled off back-to-back seven inning starts! That may be the only good news. Unfortunately, two of the five hits Miley gave up were home runs, so he surrendered three runs and left with the Orioles trailing. Counting the nine strikeouts he picked up, it was an impressive outing, and one that, with the Orioles offense being what it is - or at least what it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be - should be good enough most of the time. Is it satisfying to say that, well, sometimes a good offense gets shut down? Even though that\xe2\x80\x99s true, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it any easier to stomach when the Orioles lose a game as the season comes into its closing month. What is also true is what MASN\xe2\x80\x99s Jim Hunter observed in the game\xe2\x80\x99s final moments: This game represented the 35th time in 131 games that the O\xe2\x80\x99s offense were held to two runs or fewer.    Sometimes, good pitching is good It\xe2\x80\x99s not like they got dominated by a scrub. Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Marco Estrada has done very well for himself this season and it was easy to see why tonight. The lone run Estrada gave up was a third inning home run hit by J.J. Hardy, a fly ball with just enough oomph to clear a leaping Melvin Upton.     The Orioles, if you can believe it, led 1-0 at this point in the game. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s home run was his eighth of the year, which also happens to be as many home runs as he hit over the course of all of last season. From there, Estrada shut things down. Over his seven innings of work, Estrada gave up just four hits and a walk. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get many scoring chances like that. The Orioles only had one at-bat with a runner in scoring position in the game, in fact. That makes for a tough task to win, even if your own starter has a good game, as Miley did. Solo home runs by Josh Donaldson and Jose Bautista - two good hitters who are going to hit homers, much as it pains Orioles fans to admit - constituted most of the damage Miley allowed.    The 3-7 hitters for the Orioles went 0 for the entire game! What else can you say? It happens... though it seems to be happening a whole lot for the Orioles of late. Not all of that is because of Adam Jones being out of the lineup with his hamstring issue for a third consecutive game, or because Jonathan Schoop and his .262 post-All-Star OBP batted leadoff in this game.  The outcome is frustrating when combined with a good effort from a starter. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way it goes sometimes. Hoping for luck to turn around Maybe it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even all the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fault. They struck out \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d seven times in the game, really not very many for them. What that means is that, when you take out those strikeouts and Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s homer, there were 20 balls put in play for outs and three put in play for hits. That is a BABIP for the game of .130.     If you had the misfortune of watching the game, you saw more than one play where a reasonably well-struck ball happened to go right to a fielder, including a line drive double play hit right by Matt Wieters to Justin Smoak in the seventh inning, erasing a leadoff walk. It was one of those plays that makes you think, \xe2\x80\x9cOf COURSE that happened.\xe2\x80\x9d The Jays deserve the credit for some of that. It\xe2\x80\x99s not all luck when the fielder is in the right place at the right time. That\xe2\x80\x99s partly good positioning by the defense, or a good job by the pitcher pitching to his defense. But a .130 BABIP is not normal. That\xe2\x80\x99s luck that ought to even out, eventually. Maybe not in this series, when the Orioles need it, and maybe not in time to save their hopes for the season, but eventually! Well, the problem with relying on some pending regression is that the possibility also exists that this type of game is, in fact, the regression for previous unsustainably good luck on the part of the Orioles offense. Not that it ended up mattering, since the three runs were all the Jays needed on Monday, but the final two Jays runs scored in the top of the ninth as the Jays strung together a walk and two hits off of Tommy Hunter. Hunter did not go boom, exactly, in that he surrendered no homers, but every ball on the ground found a hole. There\xe2\x80\x99s that BABIP luck again. As of this writing, every team that the Orioles need to lose for the wild card race is winning or has already won, except for the Yankees, who are losing to the Royals, another team the Orioles need to lose.    There will be rest for neither the weary nor the wicked for the O\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow. They will be going up against a tough lefty in J.A. Happ. It\xe2\x80\x99s weird to refer to Happ as a tough lefty, but when it\xe2\x80\x99s late August and a guy has a 3.19 ERA, that mostly speaks for itself. Plus, the Orioles continue to be the worst-hitting team, by OPS, against lefty pitchers in the whole AL. And who is countering Happ for the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the 7:05 game? None other than Ubaldo Jimenez. I know, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I said too.

The Baltimore Orioles have dropped off the pace in the American League East, but they have a chance to quickly make up ground when they host the division-leading Toronto Blue Jays on Monday in the opener of a three-game series. Baltimore salvaged the finale of a three-game set at the New York Yankees on Sunday to remain three games behind Toronto. The Orioles were stomped by a combined 27-9 in the first two games at New York before halting a three-game skid with a 5-0 victory Sunday, getting a pair of homers to push their total to a major league-best 204. Mark Trumbo has gone deep in back-to-back games and tops the majors with 40 homers, but he has yet to connect in 13 games against the Blue Jays this season. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s pitching staff will be tested by a Toronto offense that produced 32 runs and nine homers in a three-game sweep of the Minnesota Twins. Reigning AL MVP Josh Donaldson put on a show against the Twins, going 6-for-10 with four homers, nine RBIs and six runs scored.

He served up three homers over four innings in a no-decision versus the Yankees in his previous turn and has surrendered six blasts during a three-start stretch. He is 1-0 with a 3.71 ERA in three starts versus Baltimore this season. Miley earned his first victory in five starts since he was acquired by Seattle at the trade deadline, giving up a pair of runs over five innings to beat the Washington Nationals.

USA TODAY Sports breaks down the road ahead for a quartet with destiny in its hands:Toronto Blue JaysCurrently: In first place, two games ahead of the Red Sox and four up on the Orioles.Playoff odds (per Fangraphs): 92.4%The rest of the schedule: 6 vs. Rays, 4 vs. Angels, 3 vs. Mariners (.460 overall winning percentage).     .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; }     p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYMLB awards watch: Kris Bryant, Jose Altuve front runners for MVP awardsGood vibes: The hot-and-cold offense broke out with 32 runs in the three-game weekend sweep of the Minnesota Twins that put Toronto a season-best 18 games over .500, and outfielders Jose Bautista and Kevin Pillar are back in the lineup. The addition of setup men Jason Grilli and Joaquin Benoit has stabilized a shaky bullpen.Bad vibes: The Jays gave up 21 runs to the Twins, requiring comebacks from at least three runs down in two of the games. Francisco Liriano (3.97 ERA in four starts with Toronto) has failed to secure his starting spot, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear whether the Blue Jays will go with a six-man rotation after Aaron Sanchez returns Wednesday.Drama: Bautista (.229 average, .804 OPS) has not enjoyed the kind of season he wanted as he enters free agency, missing 46 games and now being relegated to a DH role as he works his way back from a sprained knee, although he did homer Monday night at Baltimore. Bautista, who turns 36 in October, may be approaching his final days in Toronto. Edwin Encarnacion may be playing his way out of the team\xe2\x80\x99s future as well, but for a different reason, as his huge numbers (36 homers, AL-leading 106 RBI) are setting him up for a big payday as a free agent.Forecast: The bullpen\xe2\x80\x99s improvement and Sanchez\xe2\x80\x99s return bode well for the Blue Jays\xe2\x80\x99 chances of holding off all challengers and winning the division. Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s offense has been puzzlingly inconsistent, but Josh Donaldson\xe2\x80\x99s four homers in two days spanning Sunday and Monday may be a sign of big things to come for the whole lineup.Boston Red SoxCurrently: 2 games behind the Blue Jays and two games up for the first wild card.Playoff odds: 86%The rest of the schedule: 6 vs. Rays, 3 vs. Athletics, 3 vs. Padres (.429 overall winning percentage).Good vibes: Nobody can match the firepower. They\xe2\x80\x99re the only club in the majors with an OPS above .800, and their average of 5.42 runs a game is at least half a run higher than any other AL team. Boston also has been getting better outings from its starters since the break (3.10 ERA in August), and All-Star Steven Wright returned to action Friday after missing three weeks with a shoulder injury.Bad vibes: The bullpen has become a major concern, as underscored by Matt Barnes\xe2\x80\x99 five-run implosion in Sunday night\xe2\x80\x99s loss to the Royals. Junichi Tazawa and lefty Fernando Abad have struggled as well this month, making it harder for Boston to get the ball to closer Craig Kimbrel in save situations.Drama: David Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s season-long farewell tour continues, and he acknowledges the duties of being baseball\xe2\x80\x99s most beloved ambassador have worn him down. Ortiz is the center of attention wherever he goes, with fans and the news media wanting a piece of his time. Big Papi has handled it well and continues to lead the majors in OPS at 1.039, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to ask of a 40-year old to keep up that kind of production in the face of so many demands.Forecast: Breakout seasons by Rick Porcello - who beat Tampa Bay on Monday for his 18th win -\xc2\xa0and Wright have taken some weight off David Price, who has turned things around after the break (3.19 ERA, following a 4.34 mark in the first half). With some improved work from the relief corps, the Red Sox should be able to claim a playoff spot.     .oembed-asset-photo-image { width: 100%; } Baltimore OriolesCurrently: 4 games behind Blue Jays in division, 1-game lead over Tigers for final wild cardPlayoff odds: 43%The rest of the schedule: 7 vs. Rays, 3 vs. Tigers, 3 vs. Diamondbacks (.459 winning percentage)Good vibes: If winning is the best cologne, consider the three-run homer the aftershave. Baltimore continues pounding the baseball, with a major league-high 204 home runs. Six players have at least 19 home runs, including Mark Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s major league high 40. Third baseman Manny Machado will push Donaldson for MVP honors. The bullpen\xe2\x80\x99s 78% save conversion is second to the Yankees.Bad vibes: Kevin Gausman (3.73) and Chris Tillman (3.76) are the only pitchers with at least 10 starts with an ERA lower than 5.38. And Tillman remains on the disabled list with a shoulder injury.Drama: Center fielder Adam Jones might be nursing a hamstring injury down the stretch. Fans have had it with Ubaldo Jimenez and his 6.62 ERA, but unless Tillman returns, options are limited. Can Wade Miley - with a 1.86 WHIP in five starts as an Oriole - be at least serviceable?Forecast: Rotation woes make it tempting to write off Baltimore, but Buck Showalter has managed around the deficiencies brilliantly. It might get bumpy, but look for the Orioles to cling to that second wild card spot and maintain their own even-year magic with a third playoff berth in five seasons.New York YankeesCurrently: 7 1/2 games behind Blue Jays in division, 3 1/2 behind Orioles for final wild cardPlayoff odds: 6%The rest\xc2\xa0of the schedule: 7 vs. Rays, 2 vs. Royals, 3 vs. Dodgers (.504 winning percentage)Good vibes: Until proven otherwise, rookie catcher Gary Sanchez will match Barry Bonds\xe2\x80\x99 record-setting single-season home run rate. The blend of youth and veterans has worked out perfectly. Didi Gregorious is an above-average offensive shortstop.Bad vibes: Andrew Miller, Aroldis Chapman, Nathan Eovaldi and Luis Severino are among the arms traded, injured or shipped out since the season began. The schedule offers no breathers - even the Rays are 6-6 against the Yankees this year.Drama: How will the kids respond to four-game September slate at Fenway Park? How will it go over if Mark Teixeira is deprived of at-bats during his own farewell? Whoa, did A-Rod really just tweet that he wants to return for one more series at Yankee Stadium?Forecast: Had the Yankees pulled off a weekend sweep of Baltimore, this would look more realistic. But there\xe2\x80\x99s too many teams to pass, and too many holes to play .750 ball in September. Still, the Yankees walk away with a decent consolation prize: It\xe2\x80\x99s safe to trust the process again in the Bronx.GALLERY: MLB PHOTO OF THE DAYFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInMLB photo of the day\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

The team still has veterans with large profiles and larger salaries, but it has been youth that often carried the day.On Sunday, though, it was C. C. Sabathia, 36 and in his 16th major league season, who performed the dutiful work for the Yankees. He pitched six and two-thirds innings against the Baltimore Orioles, subduing for most of the game the fourth-highest-scoring offense in the American League.When he walked back to the Yankee Stadium dugout midway through the seventh inning, fluttering his glove in his right hand as he prepared to bounce down the steps and disappear into the clubhouse, the crowd applauded his performance, even if it had been in vain.The Yankees lost, 5-0, falling short of a three-game sweep of the Orioles and giving back a game to the team that now leads them by three and a half games for the final wild-card spot. The defeat added a sour coda to what had otherwise been a good weekend for the Yankees.

Credit             Kathy Willens/Associated Press           Orioles starter Kevin Gausman thwarted the Yankees for seven shutout innings, striking out nine, while giving up seven hits and dancing around trouble. He kept Sanchez relatively quiet, too. Sanchez, the designated hitter Sunday, went without a home run for the first time in four games but had a single and a double in four at-bats. It was just the fourth time in 11 games that he did not homer.

But he held the Mariners to a run in seven innings in his previous start, and on Sunday he looked strong again, keeping a lineup of sluggers quiet except for a solo home run by Steve Pearce. He struck out eight batters and allowed six hits.

Sabathia loaded the bases with his 99th and final pitch, walking Hyun Soo Kim, the ninth hitter in the order. Girardi came to lift him, but the Yankees were already slowly capsizing. When Pearce humbled them once more, lining a two-run single to center field off reliever Adam Warren, the game became an opportunity wasted.

In the fourth inning, with Orioles third baseman Manny Machado shifted from his usual alignment, Sanchez thought he could advance to third on a single by Mark Teixeira.

08/30/2016,"[('Tuesday Bird Droppings: Where the Orioles offense will ...', ' Hello, friends. There are now just 31 Orioles games remaining this season, unless they make it into the postseason, which if you\'ve been watching them lately are probably feeling is not too likely. What do you think it will take to win the AL East? Will they need 96 wins to win the AL East? They\'d have to go 25-6 to pull that off. Could it take 92 wins to secure even the second wild card spot? They must go 21-10.    What it adds up to is that, as likely as not, the Orioles cannot lose more games from here on out than what can be counted on both hands. They must do this against a slate of games facing tough, playoff-bound competition, and many of these games will be on the road. And they must do this while, for the moment, three-fifths of their starting rotation consists of Wade Miley, Ubaldo Jimenez, and Yovani Gallardo. My goodness. The postseason isn\'t happening this year. The rotation anxiety isn\'t even getting into the problems, such as there occasionally are, with the offense. These were on display in last night\'s 5-1 loss to the Blue Jays, where Miley actually pitched well. The O\'s only got four hits, and scored two or fewer runs for the 35th time this season. Yikes. You can read\xc2\xa0my recap of the not-so-lovely totals here. So the Orioles are four games out of the AL East. They\'re now just one game up on the Tigers for the second wild card, and two up on the Royals and Astros. They defend that slim wild card lead tonight with Ubaldo Jimenez on the mound, facing off against Jays lefty J.A. Happ. If they can only lose ten games, this is probably going to be one of the ten.    Around the blogO\'sphere Baltimore Orioles get what they need from Wade Miley, not from bats - Baltimore Orioles- ESPNWhen I found this article on Google, it displayed with the headline, ""Wade Miley surprisingly not to blame as Orioles fall behind in AL East."" Man, and I thought I could be harsh on this team sometimes.    Showalter speaks after 5-1 loss - School of RochBuck did not have very much to say after this loss, which is not usual for him. You can see for yourself here, including his attempt to dance around being critical of last night\'s strike zone. Orioles notes: Chris Tillman\'s comeback from shoulder injury underway - Baltimore SunThe early signs are encouraging for Tillman working his way back... but as we well know with this stuff, it only takes one setback and suddenly you\'re talking about a whole different timeline.    Yankees ""Aggressive"" On Waiver Wire - MLB Trade RumorsTurns out that the Orioles are trying to make some improvements on the waiver wire, but the Yankees are quite possibly standing in the way by making claims of players who could help the Orioles. That\'s the way the game goes. For what it\'s worth, O\'s will have a rep at Tebow\'s workout - BaltimoreBaseball.comIt doesn\'t mean a whole heck of a lot that the Orioles will have someone watching Tebow, but even if there\'s like a 0.5% chance the Orioles sign him, I still find myself dreading that circus involving the Orioles in any way. For Tommy Hunter, another day and interview, plus more one liners - Steve MelewskiI wouldn\'t definitely say that the Orioles brought Tommy Hunter back because he\'s hilarious, but even if it turned out that\'s why they did it, I couldn\'t blame them for doing so.    Birthdays and anniversaries Of all of the players to ever play for the Orioles, there is only one with a birthday today: 2001 short-timer Kris Foster.

On this day in history... In 1363, two Chinese forces in the late Yuan Dynasty began the Battle of Lake Poyang. With a reported 850,000 sailors and soldiers involved in the battle, this is regarded as potentially the largest naval battle in history. In 1835, the city of Melbourne was founded in Australia. A year later, on the other side of the world, the city of Houston, Texas was founded. In 1963, Thurgood Marshall was confirmed as the first African-American Supreme Court Justice in the history of the United States.    ** And that\'s the way it is in Birdland on August 30 - or at least, until something happens later.

However according to\xc2\xa0Michael Bradburg of SB Nation, the NY Yankees are foiling them at every step of the way. When a player is placed on revocable waivers, that player must first pass through every team lower than the Orioles in the standings before the Orioles can claim him.

Happ. Game time is set for just after 7 PM. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles beat Blue Jays with strong starting pitching, home ...', "" The Baltimore Orioles put on a great show tonight, getting contributions from across the roster. The most unexpected, of course, was Ubaldo Jimenez, who had himself a fine game in limiting the Jays to three runs.    On offense it was three home runs (of course) that did the trick with one each from Steve Pearce, Manny Machado, and Matt Wieters. Dongs for Happ JA Happ is a left-handed pitcher who came into this game with a 3.19 ERA. He has already beaten the Orioles twice this year. This didn\xe2\x80\x99t bode well for the Orioles, and for the first four innings it looked like the Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to do much against him. Our guys actually had base runners in innings 1-4, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of them. They went 0-for-5 with runners in scoring position, through those first four, but made up for it with a three-run fifth that put them back on top (for the moment).    As is so often the case, the Orioles used the almighty dong to get back into the game. Steve Pearce, traded for at the deadline because he is a murderer of lefties, got the party started with a solo home run to left field to tie the game.    Two batters later, Manny Machado hit 32nd home run into the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen. It was a beaut, and with a runner on gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 3-1 lead that they would hold until the seventh. The dong was the 100th of Manny\xe2\x80\x99s young career, making him the youngest Oriole to reach 100 and the third-fastest Oriole to get there.    Welcome home to Ubaldomore Just like with Wade Miley yesterday, many Orioles fans went into this game dreading the damage that would be wrought on the starting pitcher by the potent Blue Jays lineup. And just like yesterday, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. Things looked dicey for Ubaldo Jimenez through the first two innings, though he escaped with just one run allowed. In the first inning he walked two but induced an inning ending double play. In the second the evil Michael Saunders doubled and came around to score on a single. That gave the Blue Jays a 1-0 lead, but after that Ubaldo stopped pitching the way we expected him to and started kicking ass.    After giving up the RBI single, Jimenez went on to retire the next eight batters he faced. The ninth batter hit a one-out single and was immediately erased on a double play. Ubaldo followed that with a 1-2-3 sixth inning and cruised into the seventh inning with a 3-1 lead. And that\xe2\x80\x99s when things went awry. Some might say (with the benefit of hindsight) that Jimenez should have been taken out after six innings. He has a checkered past and the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a big lead. But I think him going back out for the seventh was absolutely the right call. With one out, Russell Martin on first base, and Brad Brach warming in the bullpen, guy I hate Michael Saunders came to the plate. I got nervous. You got nervous, too, I know it. Well, Saunders did just what we feared he would: he hit a game-tying home run. It was deflating and a tough way to see Ubaldo\xe2\x80\x99s night go, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it made his ruined his game. It did really stink, though. Ubaldo got one more out before being pulled for Brad Brach. His final pitching line was 6.2 IP, 5 H, 3 R, 2 BB, 3 K. Not outstanding, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that from Ubaldo any time.      Ubaldo Jimenez's ERA in his last three starts? 2.55 (5 ER in 17 2/3 IP). #Orioles\r \xe2\x80\x94 Eduardo A. Encina (@EddieInTheYard) August 31, 2016    Did I mention we like dongs? Once both starters were out of the game with the score 3-3, I felt mild confidence that the boys would get the job done. Brad Brach looked great, pitching 1.1 innings with just one single allowed. That bought time for the O\xe2\x80\x99s offense to come back. The heroes of the late innings were Jonathan Schoop and Matt Wieters. With two outs in the eighth Schoop worked a walk off of Jason Grilli to keep the inning alive for Wieters. Wieters has been disappointing at times this season, but this was not one of them. He took Grilli deep for a two-run homer onto the flag court to give the Orioles a 5-3 lead. After that it was just a formality as Zach Britton came in to get his 39th save of the season. Coming up The Orioles and Blue Jays will meet for a rubber game tomorrow with Yovani Gallardo pitching for the Orioles and and Aaron Sanchez for the Jays. This is a mismatch for sure, but after tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling a little confident.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
08/31/2016,"[('How many wins will the Orioles need to make the playoffs ...', ' There are now just 30 games remaining in the Orioles regular season. Those 30 games will determine the fate of the universe, or at least the fate of our little corner of baseball for this season.    At 72-60 right now, the Orioles sit in third place in the American League East, trailing the leading Blue Jays by two games and the second place Red Sox by one game. They have the edge for the second AL wild card spot by a single game over the Tigers, with all of the Astros, Royals, Yankees, and Mariners within four games. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of competition that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are going to have to hold off in order to just have the opportunity to play one game to continue on in the playoffs. How many wins do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take for the Orioles to hold those teams off?    The pessimist\xe2\x80\x99s case A pessimist - which longtime Camden Chat readers know is me - might look at all of these teams that are charging hard to gain ground on the O\xe2\x80\x99s and think that more than one of them will end up topping 90 wins, so if the Orioles are going to make the postseason, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to top 90 wins, too.    That means the Orioles would have to play .600 baseball just to get to 90 wins - an 18-12 record over the remainder of the season. The Orioles have topped a .600 winning percentage in both April and June this season, so they\xe2\x80\x99re capable of playing that well over a long stretch of time. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s also been a while since the Orioles have played at that caliber for that long. The O\xe2\x80\x99s finished July with a sub-.500 record and whether or not they close out the Jays series with a win tonight, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be below-.500 for August, too. Turning that around while their best starting pitcher, Chris Tillman, is on the shelf for a couple of weeks is a tough task.    The optimist\xe2\x80\x99s case Maybe they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to get above 90 wins, though. A lower number could end up being enough. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of griping in the realm of Orioles fans about the prognosticating machines  and people at Fangraphs, especially before a season kicks off. Indeed, when the staff of that website predicted the AL postseason teams before the season began, not a single one of them picked the Orioles as a postseason team.  One writer was even riding hard for the Minnesota Twins to win the AL Central. The Twins have a 49-83 record right now. More of Fangraphs thought what\xe2\x80\x99s now a .371 team would make the postseason than thought the Orioles would.    So it might surprise you that right now, based on their projected rest of season standings, Fangraphs thinks that the Orioles will claim the second wild card spot with a record of 88-74. Not an overwhelmingly great record, but then again, I am 32 years old, and there have only been four seasons in my lifetime where the Orioles have won more games than that. If you were born from 1993-1996, you\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen three seasons above 88 wins. An Orioles fan born after 1997 has only been alive for two. Fangraphs is not the only site who presently likes the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 chances. ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Dan Szymborski, the keeper of the ZiPS projection system, also projects out the Orioles to an 88-74 record (Insider required) and puts their postseason chances at 54.6% overall. You have to like them being better than 50%, though if the Orioles lose tonight, they\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be right back below 50%.  To get to 88 wins, the Orioles would have to go 16-14. That\xe2\x80\x99s merely a .520 winning percentage, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound so daunting. It may yet prove to be daunting given that the Orioles will play half of their remaining games on the road.  Up to this point in the season, the Orioles have played to a .439 winning percentage on the road. Depending on whether you round up or round down, that would mean a 6-9 or 7-8 road record for the last month of the season. If they go 6-9 on the road, they have to go 10-5 at home to reach 88 wins. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been nearly that good at home to date (.652 winning percentage,) but it\xe2\x80\x99s still a tall order. The teams chasing the Orioles And all of that is assuming that 88 wins is what gets it done. It may not do so. Of the wild card competing teams I named above, all of them except for the Royals are projected to win 16 of their remaining games. If any of those teams are hotter than that for the remainder of the season, that\xe2\x80\x99s less of a cushion the Orioles have.    The Royals get a 14-16 rest of season projection, which may be unreasonably pessimistic for them. Kansas City only plays 13 of their last 30 games against teams in the postseason hunt. The Orioles, facing an AL East-laden September with three other AL East teams in the postseason picture, must play 20 of their last 30 games against contenders. The AL East heavy schedule could be a positive, if the Orioles can win, because they will have direct chances to take games out of the Red Sox and Blue Jays and improve their own standing. But that requires them to play well against those good teams, and if they lose, their chances are doubly hurt. Games like tonight\xe2\x80\x99s where Yovani Gallardo faces the Jays sluggers do not inspire confidence. Does Detroit have an 18-12 finish in them? Can the Astros finish 19-11? The Yankees must close out with a 21-10 record in order to get above 88 wins. For the Royals it would be 20-10. The Mariners must go 21-9 to make the playoffs, if 88 wins is the number. No one of those things seems to be a likely outcome, individually. Even the team with the best record in baseball, the Cubs, has not won two-thirds of the games it has played this season. They have played to a .641 winning percentage. The Astros would \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d need to play .633 baseball from here on to get to 89 wins. For the Tigers that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmerely\xe2\x80\x9d .600 baseball for the last month.  The chances that one among that group plays as well as they need to play are greater than any one team\xe2\x80\x99s chances of doing so. And all of this is assuming that the Orioles get to 88 wins to begin with, which they may not do.     It may be optimistic to think they play .500 baseball from here on and win 87 games. Now all of the teams chasing them have that much of an easier time catching and passing them. And if they play below .500 from here on? That means forget about the postseason. An 86 win season is better than a 68 win season, but that\xe2\x80\x99s about all you can say about it.

Is it enough to get them into the playoffs?Keeping up with all the moves that the Baltimore Orioles have made over the last 24 hours? Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. We got it all taken care of for you.A lot has gone down in so little time.It started with the O\xe2\x80\x99s bringing back reliever Tommy Hunter. While it was a feel good story to bring Big Game back to the team, he also is an upgrade to the bullpen. He gives Buck Showalter a reliable option at a time when the Orioles need it most. In order to make room for Hunter, the team designated T.J. McFarland for assignment.Wednesday things got real wild.It started with the Orioles acquiring left-handed reliever Kyle Lobstein from the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Zach Phillips. To make room for Lobstein, they designated Ashur Tolliver for assignment. So logically, the O\xe2\x80\x99s would DFA Lobstein just hours later.Baltimore claimed outfielder Drew Stubbs off waivers from the Texas Rangers, and sent Lobstein to the minors in his place. The addition of Stubbs brings the O\xe2\x80\x99s a player that can play all three outfield spots and offer some speed and pop to the lineup. Orioles General Manager Dan Duquette said before the game that he is a base stealer (wait, the Orioles know what stolen bases are?).Hold on. There is more.One hour after the Orioles announced that they have claimed Stubbs, they are finalizing a deal for Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder Michael Bourn. Bourn gives the O\xe2\x80\x99s another base stealer, a category the team ranks dead last in the Majors.

The Orioles are no different. Clearly, this is a message that something is wrong with Adam Jones. If the team felt it needed not one, but two outfielders on the last day to add postseason eligible players, they are worried that Jones\xe2\x80\x99 hamstring is going to be a problem the rest of the way.But have they made enough moves to stay in the playoff hunt? Not until they find a starter. Just do not count on that happening.Before the season started, everyone knew what would make or break the Orioles season. The starting pitching was going to decide if this team would make the playoffs. That has never been more clear right now with Chris Tillman on the disabled list.Yovani Gallardo gave up two home runs in the first inning last night and the Toronto Blue Jays had an early lead in minutes. The Orioles were already playing from behind before getting a chance to swing the bats. That seems to be an all too common theme for the Orioles starters.No Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fan liked the idea of entering a pivotal series against the Blue Jays with Gallardo, Wade Miley and Ubaldo Jimenez on the mound. There is not much available in terms of staring pitching at this time of the year either. The teams that are in it are not dealing their players and rest of the teams with pieces can wait until the offseason to find the best deal. However, some team has to be dangling something better than we have seen from the O\xe2\x80\x99s starting staff.The aforementioned names were not the reason the Orioles lost the series against the Blue Jays, but they do not give you confidence the rest of the way either. Each has an ERA over 5.00 and has struggled to keep the team in ball games. That is something the O\xe2\x80\x99s can ill afford at a point of the season where every game counts.Believe it or not, the Orioles had options. Scott Kazmir is having a down year by his standards, but his 4.41 ERA and an outstanding K/9 rate of 9.02 is much better than what the current staff has to offer. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to imagine the Los Angeles Dodgers giving him up easily as they remain in the postseason chase.James Shields is having an awful season with the Chicago White Sox. His numbers are similar to those of Miley, Ubaldo and Gallardo. That is not encouraging, but if you had to pick one of the four to win you one game, your choice is still Shields. His track record is significantly better than the others.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoThat brings me to Ervin Santana, a name that was available on waivers and would have been an instant upgrade. Santana was a player that the O\xe2\x80\x99s have had interest in previously. His 3.54 ERA in 147 1/3 innings is better than every Orioles starter, and with the Minnesota Twins out of it, they are looking for an attractive offer. His contract is not team friendly, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the price you pay when your team is in the hunt.Instead, the Orioles opted for more hitters over starting pitching.Bourn and Stubbs are solid Major League players. They are already an upgrade over Nolan Reimold and give the Orioles something they do not have on the roster: speed. They can be used as pinch runners and defensive replacements late in games, but neither is going to be the reason the O\xe2\x80\x99s are in our out of the playoffs.This team would have been better with another starter in the rotation. Whether it was one of three players on waivers or someone else out there, the Orioles are going to go as far as this pitching staff will take them.

He started the ballgame, lasting just four innings before receiving the hook. He surrendered six hits and two walks, allowing four runs and striking out just two. He was spared the loss, but his season ERA is still unfortunate \xe2\x80\x94 6.67. As the bullpen struggled, the Keys couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep up with Potomac\xe2\x80\x99s pace. D.J. Stewart did hit a solo home run, while outfielder Jay Gonzalez went 3-3 with a double and RBI.     Delmarva Shorebirds 5, Greensboro Grasshoppers 3 (Game 1) Impressive starter Brian Gonzalez got the nod in this one, picking up a topsy-turvy win through five innings. He struck out five and allowed just two earned, but surrendered three walks and five hits over his 90 pitches. For the season, his ERA sits at 2.55. Randolph Gassaway continues to be hot at the dish, hitting a solo shot in his first at-bat of the game. The most notable prospect in the game one lineup, Ryan Mountcastle, went 0-4 with a pair of strikeouts.  Delmarva Shorebirds 5, Greensboro Grasshoppers 0 (Game 2) Alex Murphy was moved up to the three-hole for the second game of the doubleheader and didn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint. He picked up a solo home run and a double, walking twice to reach base all four times up to bat. Both Gerrion Grim and Ademar Rifaela notched two-home dingers.    On the mound, starter Daniel Delgado went five strong scoreless innings, allowing just one hit while striking out five. Christian Turnipseed entered to wrap up the win. Aberdeen Ironbirds 6, State College Spikes 3 Aberdeen went pitching-by-committee in this one, which most notably featured Lucas Humpal, rookie out of Texas State, tossing three innings of ERA-lowering ball. He allowed one run on three hits, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t earned.  Cody Dube, who started the game with a 2.13 ERA, also got three innings of work \xe2\x80\x94 the fellow rookie allowed a pair of earned runs in his trio of frames. Austin Hays continues to crush opposing pitching; he\xe2\x80\x99ll be a major impact youngster to watch next season. He went 2-4 with a two-run home run.

09/02/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Should the Birds bite the bullet on ...', 'Regardless of whether or not the Baltimore Orioles make it to the 2016 post season, should they bite the bullet with regard to pitching for 2017?Contrary to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of late, it\xe2\x80\x99s pitching that\xe2\x80\x99s needed by the Baltimore Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 not hitting. I suspect that when the current team was assembled there was a certain strategy or attitude of\xc2\xa0if we have enough sluggers we only need serviceable pitching. And to a certain extent that\xe2\x80\x99s been true. But a front-line starter would have helped the Orioles at various points.So whether they qualify for the post season or not (and you\xe2\x80\x99re kidding yourself if you just write them off now and say that\xe2\x80\x99s the end of it), pitching has to be a priority for 2017. But who\xe2\x80\x99s out there? The free agent crop of pitchers isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly exciting per se. Could the Orioles swing a trade?The answer to that is yes, they could. But should they or will they? And by a trade, I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about something small that brings a innings-eater. I mean a blockbuster-type trade that would bring a top-of-the-rotation starter. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about a\xc2\xa0David Price or a\xc2\xa0Clayton Kershaw-type of pitcher.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean them specifically \xe2\x80\x93 but someone along those lines. And the answer to that is yes, they should. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one problem; the O\xe2\x80\x99s would have to give away some pretty impressive players in order to get someone of that stature. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking a Schoop or perhaps even a Machado. Keep in mind that teams have never been shy about inquiring about some of the superstars the Orioles have in their lineup.But the question is whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s worth considering. Again contrary to what we see now, the Birds have plenty of hitting. I would submit that Machado is probably untouchable. But regardless of who could be in play and who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, would Orioles fans support a move like this? Keep in mind, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a front line pitcher \xe2\x80\x93 you pick which one. This wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a middke-of-the-rotation type of guy, but a big-time starter. Think Scherzer, or someone along those lines.Would fans support this? Because that might be what it takes to get someone along those lines. And here\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing; you have to always adjust for the dimension\xe2\x80\x99s of one\xe2\x80\x99s home ballpark. Camden Yards being a hitter\xe2\x80\x99s park, it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say that a great pitcher would continue to be great. But there is a reasonable argument that a great hitter will be better.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tough call.

While New York is mounting a charge, the Orioles are 2-5 in their last seven games after dropping two of three at home to AL East-leading Toronto. Sitting four games behind the Blue Jays and tied with Detroit for the top wild card, the Orioles continue to be reliant on the long ball, leading the majors with 209 homers.

Chris Davis is 0-for-13 since smacking a pair of homers off Green last Saturday.

Teixeira was born in Annapolis, Md., and went to high school in Baltimore.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had some great games here,\xe2\x80\x9d Teixeira said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy first three-home-run game was here, with the Texas Rangers. Always seem to hit a bunch of home runs here. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a good place to hit. So I\xe2\x80\x99ve always enjoyed playing here.\xe2\x80\x9dBut the Orioles have not been kind this weekend as the Yankees continued to eye a wild-card playoff spot. Baltimore shut out the Yankees for the second night in a row, 2-0. The Orioles hold the second American League wild-card spot, which makes each game in this series so important.\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s game is probably the most important game of the year,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Joe Girardi said.The Yankees now sit four and a half games back in the wild-card race. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      They managed just two hits Friday, both against starter Dylan Bundy. On Saturday, Orioles starter Kevin Gausman also allowed just two hits and struck out eight in six innings. The Yankees finished with four hits.

Jacoby Ellsbury walked, Gary Sanchez singled, and Didi Gregorius was hit by a pitch, loading the bases with one out. But Starlin Castro struck out and Brian McCann flied out to get Gausman and the Orioles out of the jam.\xe2\x80\x9cHe was just living on the edges with all his pitches, not only his fastball, but his breaking ball and his splitter,\xe2\x80\x9d Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge said of Gausman. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, just really locating his spots.\xe2\x80\x9d Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

Sabathia had a solid outing for the Yankees, going six innings and giving up six hits and one earned run. The Orioles broke through first in the fourth inning. Mark Trumbo led off with a double to left field. Then, later in the inning, Chris Davis singled to right field. Trumbo initially held up at third base, but Judge mishandled the ball as he tried to glove it. Trumbo scored on the error.

The Orioles hit four home runs in Friday\xe2\x80\x99s 8-0 victory, and they lead the A.L. with 214.

On Saturday, a magnetic resonance imaging test revealed that he had a sprained ulnar collateral ligament and a strained flexor tendon in the elbow. The injury puts the rest of his season in jeopardy and will force the Yankees to replace him in the rotation.

In 24 games, Sanchez hit .389 with 11 home runs, 21 runs batted in and 20 runs scored. He reached 11 home runs faster than anyone in major league history: 23 career games.\xe2\x80\x9cFeels great to win the award,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanchez said, speaking through an interpreter before Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game. \xe2\x80\x9cThe focus is to win games right now \xe2\x80\x94 we want to keep winning games, we want to keep winning series. This is a new month now, and so that\xe2\x80\x99s what we want to focus on.\xe2\x80\x9dSanchez has cooled down. On this trip, he is 4 for 21 with eight strikeouts. He went 1 for 4 with two strikeouts on Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s part of baseball,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanchez said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go through ups and downs.

The Yankees arrived in Baltimore two and a half games out of the second wild-card spot, currently shared by the Orioles and the Detroit Tigers. They will leave it one more game back, with 27 left in the regular season.While the Yankees were not able to cut into the deficit this weekend, it could have been worse for them. A loss on Sunday would have put them five and a half games behind Baltimore \xe2\x80\x94 and trailing Detroit, Houston, Kansas City and Seattle in pursuit of the Orioles.\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose three in a row to these guys,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we know they play really well in this building. We lost a tough game last night. To be able to bounce back today is important and keeps us alive.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The Yankees went with a particularly young lineup Sunday: Rob Refsnyder, Aaron Judge, Tyler Austin and Ronald Torreyes all started. Girardi rested Didi Gregorius, whose arm was sore after being hit by a pitch on Saturday night. Mark Teixeira also was on the bench, as he usually has been for a day game after a night game.

In 82 plate appearances entering the game, Romine was hitting .273 against left-handers, compared with a .245 average over all.

Pineda said that if a pitch was located well, it could lead to a ground ball or strikeout \xe2\x80\x94 the kind of results that can keep Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s power hitters at bay.\xe2\x80\x9cThose guys, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to swing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.The Yankees will now start a 10-game homestand while still in the middle of the wild-card race, although it remains an uphill battle with several teams in contention.

It\xe2\x80\x99s almost unfathomable that someone could have that much trouble \xe2\x80\x93 and/or be that incredibly unlucky \xe2\x80\x93 over the course of a season.     .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; }     p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYHouston Astros' Alex Bregman is USA TODAY Sports' Minor League Player of the YearRemember, as Joseph progressed through the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 system, he was known more for his bat than his glove. In 2013, his last full season in the minors, Joseph batted .299 with 22 homers and 97 RBI\xc2\xa0at Class AA Bowie (Md.). Heading into this year, he was a .223 hitter with 20 homers and 77 RBI\xc2\xa0in 182 games (parts of two seasons) for the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 not great, but certainly passable for a reserve catcher with strong defensive skills.This year, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 affable back-up backstop has played in 42 games, been to the plate 124 times and registered 117 official at-bats. He has 22 hits, including two doubles, and is batting .188 on the season.He has come to the plate 25 times with runners in scoring position (second base or third base) and has two singles and a walk without plating a run. Consider this: In those 24 official at-bats, Joseph has struck out only five times. So, in 17 times with runners in scoring position this year, he put the ball in play and it went to someone for an out. Incredible.With 24 games remaining in the regular season, Joseph, as the backup to Matt Wieters, will probably get six to eight more starts. That translates to about 25 more plate appearances.It\xe2\x80\x99s likely he receives the start Wednesday afternoon in Tampa, a day game after a night game, because Wieters is going to get two consecutive days off before the Orioles begin a run of 17 straight contests. (Catcher Francisco Pena is also on the active roster.)Joseph, obviously, is aware of the RBI-less situation. He was sent to Class AAA\xc2\xa0Norfolk in August to get more at-bats, and when he drove in a run there, he stood at first base and pantomimed grabbing an imaginary monkey from his back and tossing it to the ground.So Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s sharp sense of humor is intact.In 40 at-bats for the Tides, Joseph had 10 hits and drove in four runs. When he played for Class AA Bowie (Md.) and High-A Frederick (Md.) this year as part of an injury rehab assignment \xe2\x80\x93 he underwent testicular surgery in late May when he was hit with a foul tip \xe2\x80\x93 Joseph drove in seven runs in a combined 46 plate appearances.So he has 11 RBI\xc2\xa0in 2016, just none in the majors.If he does get one \xe2\x80\x93 and only one \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99ll also make baseball history. According to Elias, the most at-bats with just one RBI in a season was 114, set by Minnesota Twins\xe2\x80\x99 infielder Johnny Goryl in 1964. Joseph is already three at-bats ahead of Goryl\xe2\x80\x99s season total.It was Goryl\xe2\x80\x99s 90th at-bat and 38th game of the 1964 season when he dropped a sacrifice bunt in the fourth inning on July 28 against the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 of all teams \xe2\x80\x94 and Hall of Famer Robin Roberts. Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first baseman Norm Siebern picked it up and recorded the unassisted out, but Rich Rollins scored from third to give Goryl a RBI.Goryl played in 20 more games that season, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t plate another run.Joseph still has nearly a month to sidestep infamy \xe2\x80\x93 any maybe even Goryl\xe2\x80\x99s one RBI record \xe2\x80\x93 and he could get another crack at it today.It always seems like when we write about a guy on a hot streak, he inevitably goes cold. So maybe this will be a reverse jinx for Joseph.Connolly writes for\xc2\xa0BaltimoreBaseball.com, an affiliate of USA TODAY Sports Media Group.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE "", 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Listen Live: Orioles VS Rays [Live Audio] MLB - CBS Baltimore', ' Listen live as the Baltimore Orioles take on the Tampa Bay Rays at\xc2\xa0Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Chris Davis and the Baltimore Orioles have padded their numbers at the expense of the Tampa Bay Rays this season. With a homer in each of the first two contests of the series, Davis looks to send the visiting Orioles to a sweep of the cellar-dwelling Rays on Wednesday afternoon as the American League East rivals conclude their set at Tropicana Field. Davis recorded his fifth homer and 13th RBI of 2016 against Tampa Bay in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s 11-2 rout, marking Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s fourth victory in five games overall and 11th in 14 encounters with the Rays. The 30-year-old slugger is 8-for-18 with three blasts, six RBIs and five runs scored during his five-game hitting streak and belted a first-inning grand slam against Wednesday starter Drew Smyly in a 12-5 victory at Camden Yards on June 26. Baltimore, which holds a one-game lead over Detroit for the second wild card, has recorded 30 runs over its last five games while Tampa Bay has endured troubles with its offense all season. As a result, the Rays fired hitting coach Derek Shelton and promoted Chad Mottola to the same position prior to Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s game. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Dylan Bundy (8-5, 3.47 ERA) vs. Rays LH Drew Smyly (6-11, 4.94) Bundy made amends after allowing five runs in four innings at Yankee Stadium on Aug. 27 by scattering two hits over 5 2/3 frames in a 8-0 victory over New York six days later. The 23-year-old rookie may have won two of his last three starts, but his 11 walks leave plenty to be desired. Bundy has come a long way since he made his first major-league start at Tampa Bay on July 17, yielding three homers and four runs over 3 1/3 innings of a 5-2 setback. Smyly may own a 4-0 mark over his last eight starts, but the 27-year-old was fortunate to walk away with a no-decision on Wednesday after permitting five runs in as many innings against Boston. Smyly continues to be plagued by the long ball as he allowed two homers for the second time in three starts and 29 in 26 outings this season. Smyly has enjoyed success in his career versus Baltimore with a 4-1 mark, however he was taken to task for eight runs on 10 hits \xe2\x80\x93 including three homers \xe2\x80\x93 in his last encounter on June 26.

All five affiliates played their final games on Monday, wrapping up quite the season down on the farm.    There were ups and downs, prospects who shined and rookies who made a very encouraging first-year impact. Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s on to the offseason for dozens and dozens of prospects to perfect their games in preparation for 2016.  With that said, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for a quick recap of the highlights at every level, spotlighting on the guys who made the 2016 minor-league season incredibly exciting to break down. Norfolk Tides Final record: 62-82 It certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the most profitable season for the Orioles AAA club, but the feeder club wasn\xe2\x80\x99t awfully void of talent.     Prospect-wise, our game recaps were very focused on Trey Mancini, who consistently displayed a next-level readiness. In 125 games with the Tides, the 24-year-old compiled a .282 average, hitting 13 home runs and driving in 54 RBI. His on-base percentage finished at .349, second amongst qualifying Tides.    The two outfield prospects, Christian Walker and Dariel Alvarez, spent all season with the club. Walker hit .264 with 18 HRs, while Alvarez consistently sprayed the baseball around with a .288 average. The \xe2\x80\x9csurprise of the club\xe2\x80\x9d award has to be handed to Corban Joseph, who was by far the most impressive piece in the lineup during his 85 games played. He slashed .305/.362/.435, leading the team in average and on-base percentage. While he isn\xe2\x80\x99t a top-30 prospect and he\xe2\x80\x99ll turn 28 this fall, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to deny the impact he had with Norfolk this year.    Pitching was unwatchable throughout the season \xe2\x80\x94 not a surprising fact considering the lack of prospects available at the triple-A level. Of course, Joe Gunkel had an impressive season, but the overall performances from the crop of starters were consistently bad. Oliver Drake, the team\xe2\x80\x99s highest AAA pitching prospect, was decent (2.72 ERA, 1.22 WHIP), but he\xe2\x80\x99ll be 30 at the start of next season. Bowie Baysox Final record: 56-86 Finishing that far under .500 is pretty much all you need to know about this team. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t good to start the season, and they weren\xe2\x80\x99t good to end it.    Chance Sisco was the cream of the crop for the entirety of the season, consistently displaying the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready to take a potential giant next step in 2017. His season was brilliant, hitting .320 over 112 games, leading the team\xe2\x80\x99s regulars with a .406 on-base percentage. In other words: he\xe2\x80\x99s ready. Other than Sisco, the rest of the offense was full of disappointing performances from players completely off the prospect radar.  Garabez Rosa did perform well in his 110 games with the Baysox (.303 average, 8 HR, 62 RBI), but it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to see him contributing with the Orioles at the major-league level. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be 27 at the start of next year. Starter Chris Lee was brilliant through his first eight games, but an injury at the end of May kept him out for the rest of the season. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be someone to watch in 2017, potentially finding his way to earning a few starts at some point. Starting pitching was exhausting in Bowie as well, as no regular starter (other than Lee) had fewer hits than innings pitched on the season. Also, five of the six pitchers who made double-digit starts had ERAs over 4.65. That\xe2\x80\x99s an ugly stat.    Jason Garcia couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take the next step, an unfortunate year for the 23-year-old. The opposition hit .291 against him on the year and walked 54 times in 123.2 innings. Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s WHIP was 1.54 to finish the season, paired with a 4.73 ERA. David Hess, 24th on the top-30 prospect list, was even worse, as he allowed a .310 average against. His walk numbers were slightly lower, but he struggled to miss bats all season long. He finished 5-13 with a 5.37 ERA in 24 starts at the AA level. Frederick Keys Final record: 68-72 Despite a lack of intriguing prospects, Frederick managed to have a decent season season in the Carolina League. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect, but there were a few standout stars. The biggest name here was without a doubt Jomar Reyes, the Orioles #5 prospect. Just 19 years old, Reyes had the bulk of the attention on a nightly basis after a tremendous 2015 with Delmarva. Unfortunately, his 2016 season was marked with disappointment across the board. He hit just .228 on the season, putting together an overall .271 on-base percentage. His walk rate of just 5% was a key contributor to the latter number, but the overall season was a wash for a kid with massive expectations at the onset of the season.     Fireball-throwing reliever Tanner Scott threw 48.1 innings with the Keys this year, but he walked 42 batters in the process. His command hasn\xe2\x80\x99t improved, even if he is still hitting 100 miles per hour. Both Matthew Grimes and John Means began the season with great success, however the leap to double-A seemed to stump both 2014 draft picks. Ultimately, they were the true highlights of Frederick\xe2\x80\x99s starting pitching performances.  Full-season corner infielder Anderlin Rodriguez was by-far the highlight of the Keys season, perhaps the surprise of the O\xe2\x80\x99s minor-league system as a whole. The 24-year-old crushed the ball all season long, finishing the year slashing .304/.359/.532 with 26 home runs and 93 RBI. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear what his future holds, but 2016 was certainly kind to Anderlin. Out of the bullpen, 25th-ranked prospect Garrett Cleavinger was largely a disappointment after his promotion from Delmarva \xe2\x80\x94 he worked in 20 games, struggling with a 4.82 ERA and 1.55 WHIP. Delmarva Shorebirds Final record: 73-66 Now these guys, they were fun. Prospects aplenty, Delmarva was consistently putting up big numbers in the nightly box scores.    19-year-old shortstop Ryan Mountcastle was the most notable prospect who spent his full season in Delmarva, and unlike Reyes, this teenager helped his squad throughout the season with impressive numbers. He hit .281 on the season, slugging .426 with some sparks of power. His development next season will be exciting. Catcher Alex Murphy also showed off in Delmarva, acting as a very reliable catcher behind the dish along with a valuable bat. The Calvert Hall alum slashed .252/.335/.423, leading the team with 63 RBI. How about 16 home runs for a bit of pop, too? As he continues his development, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see how the Orioles view him as a potential trade piece down the line. D.J. Stewart spent the first half of his season here, struggling to be a consistent presence at the dish. However, after being called up to Frederick in June, he hit .279 with a .389 on-base percentage. On the bump, perhaps no starter in the Orioles system was better than 20-year-old Brian Gonzalez. The 6\xe2\x80\x993\xe2\x80\x9d, 230-pound lefty went 10-8 with a 2.50 ERA in 27 starts. He struck out 111 batters in 147.2 innings, allowing just 135 hits. If he can improve command, the 2014 third-round pick is a name that\xe2\x80\x99ll stick at the top of the prospect list. Another 19-year-old (who will start next season the same age, by the way) Ofelky Peralta got a unique look at pitching in professional baseball as well. His first full non-rookie ball season with the Orioles saw issues with free passes (60 walks in 103.1 innings), but he surrendered just 87 hits while striking out 101. All in all, it was a successful opening campaign for a kid who should join Gonzalez as a must-watch arm in 2017.    If you followed any of the minor-league recaps at Camden Chat this year, you know who Yermin Mercedes is. If not, here\xe2\x80\x99s his stat line this year. Enjoy. A dark horse to watch would be 21-year-old righty Cristian Alvarado, who brilliantly navigated through a full 27-start season with the Shorebirds. He paired his 3.41 ERA with a 1.16 WHIP, compiling 148 strikeouts in 148 innings. That\xe2\x80\x99s good, very good. Aberdeen Ironbirds Final record: 32-43 The record doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter in short-season A ball \xe2\x80\x94 what counted this season in Aberdeen was the performances of the prospects, and oh were there prospects to be watched. To keep things simple, here are the bullet-points, prospects in order according to the top-30 list:  Cody Sedlock merely scratched the surface in his pro ball debut, but he certainly proved that his college performance wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fluke. In 27 innings, opposing batters hit just .158 against, striking out 25 times. All eyes will be on #SedlockWatch next season. The Orioles took Matthias Dietz in the second-round, sending him to Aberdeen to work alongside Sedlock. He struggled in 18.2 innings, allowing 22 hits and walking 10. He was a junior college standout, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to form too much of an opinion with such a terribly small sample size. Keegan Akin, another second-round selection, performed near perfectly in Aberdeen, posting a 1.05 ERA and 0.85 WHIP through 26 innings. With just 15 hits allowed and 29 strikeouts compiled, his nine mini-starts were great. Austin Hays, the 21-year-old third-round selection, was fantastic in 38 games played. He dealt with a pesky wrist injury that kept him out for about a month, but his numbers were worth the price of admission when he did play \xe2\x80\x94 .336/.386/.514, 4 HR and 21 RBI. Preston Palmeiro hit .258, knocking in 18 RBI in 34 games. Again, a small sample size, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be noteworthy after his impressive career at N.C. State. Australian-born pitcher Alex Wells nearly overshadowed the performances of the 2016 picks with his overall performance with the Ironbirds through 13 starts. He tossed 62.2 innings, allowing just 48 hits and nine walks. At just 19 years old, it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say he\xe2\x80\x99ll be spotlighted approaching next season.

09/08/2016,"[('MLB Playoffs 2016: The Orioles chances with 23 games ...', ' Wednesday afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles loss to the Rays could hardly have been worse. There are only so many games left and the O\xe2\x80\x99s need to win the winnable games against bad teams. That\xe2\x80\x99s the bad news.    The good news is that the three days of baseball just played could hardly have gone better for the Orioles, short of the O\xe2\x80\x99s getting that sweep. One of the teams the Orioles are chasing in the division, the Blue Jays, stumbled and got swept, and since the Orioles won their own series, they made sure that most of the competition coming from below could get no closer to them. Trailing the Jays by just a game for the first wild card spot, and the Red Sox by only two games for the division lead, the Orioles are not out of hope for passing either one of those teams, or potentially even both. They will be playing one another this weekend, giving the Orioles prime chance of gaining ground if they can play well. The Orioles are going to need to play well for their wild card spot\xe2\x80\x99s sake this weekend, too. The Detroit Tigers, now one game behind the O\xe2\x80\x99s for that playoff spot, await the Orioles for a crucial and potentially decisive showdown.    Through Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s results, the Fangraphs standings predictions still think that the Orioles, finishing with 88 wins, will take the second wild card spot. We\xe2\x80\x99ll stick with that until finding out something different.    Baltimore Orioles  Wild Card Standing: Road wild card team; one game behind Jays for home spot Yesterday: Lost to Rays, 7-6 Next series: at Tigers (75-64), three games  Current playoff chances: 46.1% (up from 37.2 before Monday\xe2\x80\x99s games) To reach 88 wins: 12-11  Detroit Tigers  Wild Card Standing: One game behind Orioles Yesterday: Lost to White Sox, 7-4 Next series: vs. Orioles (76-63), three games Current playoff chances: 45.9% (down from 57) To reach 88 wins: 13-10  Houston Astros  Wild Card Standing: Two games behind Orioles Yesterday: Lost to Indians, 6-5 Next series: at Indians today, then at Twins (52-88), three games Current playoff chances: 22.4% (up from 18.3) To reach 88 wins: 14-9  New York Yankees  Wild Card Standing: 2.5 games behind Orioles Yesterday: Beat Blue Jays, 2-0 Next series: vs. Rays (59-79), four games Current playoff chances: 8.5% (up from 2.6) To reach 88 wins: 15-9  Kansas City Royals  Wild Card Standing: Four games behind Orioles Yesterday: Lost to Twins, 6-5 Next series: at White Sox (67-72), three games Current playoff chances: 3.5% (up from 2.6) To reach 88 wins: 16-7  With apologies to the Mariners, I\xe2\x80\x99m digging the wild card grave for them for the year. Although their postseason chance is the same as the Royals (3.5%) they are now five games back with 23 games to play and five teams to pass. If they pull off a sweep this weekend, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put them back in the picture. It\xe2\x80\x99s still something of a question whether 88 wins will really be enough to win this thing. And by \xe2\x80\x9cthis thing\xe2\x80\x9d I really mean the right to go on the road for a one game winner-take-all wild card game, which, what is that even worth, really? Maybe the Orioles used up all of their wild card game good luck four years ago!    All that the Orioles have to do to get to 88 wins now is win more games than they lose.  However, only seven of their final 23 games will be against non-contenders, and 12 of the final 23 will be played on the road. The fact that the Orioles will be playing the Tigers this weekend gives them a great opportunity to put some daylight on their closest competitor. All of these other teams in the race will be playing non-contenders this weekend, though, so they likely aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to shake any of them over the next three days. The Orioles have better postseason chances than they did three days ago. That\xe2\x80\x99s good, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll be better still if they can improve on that three days from now. And of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s only the way the standings look in three weeks time that really matters.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

As of 5 p.m. Saturday, the Red Sox had a one game lead on the Blue Jays, the Orioles were 2.5 behind Boston, and the Yankees were 3.5 back.If the Yankees win, and the Orioles win, four teams will be between three games in the American League.For the Baltimore Orioles, it means each game is magnified. The positive in that is that Chris Tillman returns on Sunday to the rotation, and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day should not be far behind. The O\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen has been very good in September, despite using some pieces in some blowout games.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 rotation is also pitching better, and if Tillman is effective in his return, it would only further boost the rotation.

This before Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s Aybar grounded into a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice-RBI in the last of the fourth to give them their second run. Again however, that was an example of Jimenez minimizing the damage after getting a couple of runners on base.Matt Wieters smacked his second homer of the game, this one of the three-run variety, in the last of the sixth. That ran the score to 11-2, and sent most of the Comerica Park crowd for the exits. Detroit had scheduled a fireworks night, but many people didn\xe2\x80\x99t stay around for that. Detroit would add one additional run in the eighth, but this was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 night in the motor city.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

The series is now split, making this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s rubber match very important. The Orioles chased Detroit starter Jordan Zimmerman very early in this game, however given the fact that rosters are 40 players now they don\xe2\x80\x99t get the luxury of having tired out Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen. There are more where that came from in a sense.The series will conclude this afternoon, with Chris Tillman making his return from the DL in order to make the start. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by none other than Justin Verlander, in what should be a great pitching match-up. Game time is set for just after 1 PM.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles fall on a late Detroit home run at Comerica ParkI\xe2\x80\x99d be remiss if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. As you follow baseball and perhaps football today, take a moment and remember the victims of those senseless attacks on that September day a decade-and-a-half ago. May we never forget the countless innocents who perished that day, nor the bravery that we saw \xe2\x80\x93 both then and in the subsequent years by our armed services. May the victims rest in peace, and may God continue to bless America. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

powerful and contentious protests now almost every time we turn on the TV and watch an NFL game.It started with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sitting, and later kneeling, during the national anthem during the NFL exhibition season. He was soon joined by teammate Eric Reid. It extended to Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall before Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s NFL season opener.By Sunday, there were four NFL teams with players expressing silent protests, including Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty of the New England Patriots, who stood with raised fists following the anthem.Yet, since that Aug. 26 day when Kaepernick gained attention for his protest against racial inequality in this country - with his season opener scheduled Monday night against the Los Angeles Rams - there have been nearly 250 Major League Baseball games played, and not a single player has taken a stand.Or, in this case, a knee.This is the sport that launched the civil rights movement when Jackie Robinson integrated the game of baseball on April 15, 1947, finally breaking the color barrier.Now, at a time when even entire high school football teams and soccer players are waging silent protests by sitting or kneeling during the national anthem, there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a single protest in baseball.Perhaps someone is quietly sitting on the dugout bench, or even lingering in the clubhouse until the national anthem is over, but no one has publicly made their intentions known.Why?\xe2\x80\x9cWe already have two strikes against us already,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Baltimore Orioles All-Star center fielder Adam Jones told USA TODAY Sports, \xe2\x80\x9cso you might as well not kick yourself out of the game. In football, you can\xe2\x80\x99t kick them out. You need those players. In baseball, they don\xe2\x80\x99t need us.\xe2\x80\x9cBaseball is a white man\xe2\x80\x99s sport.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Indeed, African Americans comprise 68% of the player population in the NFL, and 74% in the NBA. That number is\xc2\xa0just 8% in baseball, with only 69 African-Americans on the opening-day rosters and disabled lists this season.     .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; }     p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYWhy Rick Porcello\xe2\x80\x99s 20th win deserves more acclaimThis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that anyone who protests racial inequality or police brutality will be released from their teams, or banished from baseball, never to wear a uniform again. Still, in the conservative world of baseball, whose players stand 162 times for the national anthem, playing in front of more fans than any sport in the country, they could face much more ridicule and ostracization.Jones, 31, one of the most outspoken and passionate African-American players in baseball, certainly empathizes with the injustices that minorities face every day in this country. He sees and hears too many incidents of police brutality in his own city that have unfairly targeted minorities, and was an important voice in the aftermath of protests that followed the death in police custody of Freddie Gray, a series of events that compelled the Orioles to play a 2015 game in front of an empty stadium.Jones would like to see change, too, but Sunday, just like every other day, he stood at attention during the national anthem before their game against the Detroit Tigers, with his right hand over his heart.\xe2\x80\x9cHe believes in what he believes in,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Jones says of Kaepernick, \xe2\x80\x9cand as a man of faith, as an American who has rights, who am I to say he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9cKaepernick is not disrespecting the military. He\xe2\x80\x99s not disrespecting people who they\xe2\x80\x99re fighting. What he\xe2\x80\x99s doing is showing that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the social injustice that the flag represents.\xe2\x80\x9cLook, I know a lot of people who don\xe2\x80\x99t even know the words to the national anthem. You know how many times I see people stand up for the national anthem and not pay attention. They stand because they\xe2\x80\x99re told to stand.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the problem. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t do something because you\xe2\x80\x99re told to do something. Do it because you understand the meaning behind it and the sacrifice behind it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Whether you agree or disagree with Kaepernick\xe2\x80\x99s method to draw attention to the inequalities in this country, Jones is dismayed how the public views Kaepernick compared to 49er teammates. Go ahead, check out the difference in coverage since Kapernick sat during the national anthem compared to his teammate, Bruce Miller. Miller was arrested last week and charged with aggravated assault, elder abuse, threats and battery against 70-year-old man and his 29-year-old son. The 49ers later released him.\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s my thing,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Jones says, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s somebody on the 49ers\xe2\x80\x99 team that commits an act like that, accosts a 70-year-old man and his kid, and nobody\xe2\x80\x99s talking about that. But they talk about Kaepernick doing something that he believes in, as his right as an American citizen. People need to talk more about that guy than Kaepernick.\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not receiving the ridicule and public torture that Kaepernick is facing. Is Kaepernick hurting me? No. Is he hurting random people out there? No. I support his decision.\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the day, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t respect his freedoms, then why the hell are we Americans? It\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be the Land of the Free, right?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99     .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; }     p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYJustin Verlander has it all \xe2\x80\x94 including, once again, dominance on the moundJones, who was honored last week by receiving the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 nomination for the prestigious Roberto Clemente award for his community involvement, philanthropy and contributions, may have chosen a different way to express his views about racial inequality in this country. Yet, his heart aches over the public outrage and abuse Kaepernick has received.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Kaepernick called the N-word,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Jones said, \xe2\x80\x9cjust because he\xe2\x80\x99s being sensitive to what has happened to African-Americans in this country. It\xe2\x80\x99s crazy how when people of color speak up, we\xe2\x80\x99re always ridiculed. But when people that are not of color speak up, it\xe2\x80\x99s their right.\xe2\x80\x9cThe First Amendment says we have freedom of expression. We\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be so free, so free. But any time anybody of color speaks up in the United States, for some odd reason, they always get the raw end of the deal. It sucks.\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the day, black men have fought for this right. Indians have fought for this right. White people fought for this right. Mexicans have fought for this right. Japanese have fought this for this right. The United States was not just made up of one race.\xe2\x80\x9cSo let\xe2\x80\x99s just not say that in America, only one person can say something. We all have input because America has always been a country that has united everybody.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99The problem, Jones says, is that most fans don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear their athletes share their opinions outside the sports world. They\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to talk about race, religion, political views, or anything that could create ill will, or discomfort among the fan base. You know, stick to sports.\xe2\x80\x9cThe outside world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really respect athletes,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Jones says, \xe2\x80\x9cunless they talk about what they want them to talk about. Society doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think we deserve the right to have an opinion on social issues.\xe2\x80\x9cWe make a lot of money, so we just have to talk baseball, talk football. But most athletes, especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re tenured in your sport, you\xe2\x80\x99re educated on life, and on more things than most people on the outside. But because Donald Trump is a billionaire, he can say whatever he wants, because he\xe2\x80\x99s older and has more money?\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when Kaepernick does something, or says something, he\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculed. Why is that? \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali, Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown, Olympians John Carlos and Tommie Smith and NBA Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar all spoke out about racial inequalities. All survived the public storm of criticism, though some paid a heavier price.Even Jackie Robinson, the man who Martin Luther King even credited for starting the civil rights movement, became a strong advocate for racial equality during his career and afterwards, and even voiced his opinion about the national anthem in his 1972 autobiography, I Never Had it Made.\xe2\x80\x9cAs I write this \xe2\x80\xa6I cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag; I know that I am a black man in a white world. In 1972, in 1947, at my birth in 1919, I know that I never had it made.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Once again, Robinson was ahead of his time, opening plenty of doors, but nearly 70 years later, so many are still closed. It provoked Kaepernick to publicly display his discontent, with the movement spreading, and causing everyone to take notice. Due to love or loathing, Kaepernick\xe2\x80\x99s social media presence has increased 35,000% since he spoke up.In these final three weeks of the regular season, during the postseason, or perhaps even on the national stage of the World Series, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if any baseball player now dares to take a stand.\xe2\x80\x9cNo one has done it, yet,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Jones says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s the key word here: Yet.\xe2\x80\x9cWe will see.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99GALLERY: MLB photo of the dayFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInMLB photo of the day\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

On the other hand, it\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon, there\xe2\x80\x99s no game for six hours, and MLB just released next year\xe2\x80\x99s schedules, so let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look! You can see the schedule for yourself here.    For the second straight season, the Orioles will open up at home. Opening Day is Monday, April 3 against the Blue Jays. The standard and confusing day after Opening Day off day is followed by another Jays game on April 5, before yet another off day and the beginning of the \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d schedule.  In fact, the Orioles have five off days in April. They will pay the price for the April inactivity eventually, because starting July 14 - the day after the All-Star break - the Orioles only have three off days from then until September 6. That\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a brutal stretch, including the O\xe2\x80\x99s lone west coast trip of the season, a ten game swing.  Until and probably after being presented with evidence to the contrary, I\xe2\x80\x99ll assume this  post-All-Star break punishment is part of MLB\xe2\x80\x99s low-level campaign to screw the Orioles whenever possible as retribution for the MASN court case.    The rotating interleague calendar works out so that the Orioles will be playing the NL Central in the 2017 season. That means the Orioles will be hosting the Cubs and Cardinals for three games each at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, while traveling on the road for three games each against the Reds and Brewers. Split across different months will be two games home against the Pirates and two on the road.    In addition, the O\xe2\x80\x99s and Washington will play their annual two-and-two series on four consecutive days from May 8-11. That\xe2\x80\x99s a Monday through Thursday. Why MLB does not make any effort to align this series over a weekend remains a mystery. One quirk of this year\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is that the Orioles were never scheduled to play the Red Sox at home on a weekend. That won\xe2\x80\x99t be the case in 2017, as there is a weekend series in April and another from June 1-4 (Thursday-Sunday).    The 2016 season saw the Orioles play more at home than on the road in the first half of the season. That will be flipped next year. Just 41 of 88 pre-All-Star games will be at home. That means the busiest month at Camden Yards will be August, when they will play 16 home games. That\xe2\x80\x99s bad news if they are as bad on the road next year as they were this year, as is the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be playing 15 of their final 22 games of the season on the road, including the last five of the year.  The Orioles have two ten game road trips - one in August and one in September. So, though they get a more home-heavy second half, they will still have a punishing road schedule. Further evidence of MLB being out to get the Orioles, of course.     One bit of silver lining here, if the 2017 Rays are as bad as the 2016 Rays, is that seven of their final nine games will be played against Tampa Bay. The last regular season game will be played on October 1. Much like this year, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an AL East-heavy final month of the season. Starting on August 31, the Orioles will only play five non-division games the rest of the way. April is about as laden with division opponents, as the O\xe2\x80\x99s only play three non-AL East games in the season\xe2\x80\x99s first month. The Orioles will be at home on Memorial Day (May 29) and Labor Day (Sept. 4) and that\xe2\x80\x99s it for the holiday games. Both of those games are against the Yankees. The Orioles press release counts Father\xe2\x80\x99s Day (June 18) as a national holiday, which I hope will make you laugh as much as it made me laugh. Anyway, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be at home against the Cardinals. If the pattern from the last four seasons continues as reported by The Washington Times, Orioles fans will be the last of 30 MLB teams to get to buy their tickets for the season. Good thing there\xe2\x80\x99s still a current postseason chase to keep our attention.    ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The Baltimore Orioles are surging toward the top of the American League East again and will try to take advantage of the 11-game homestand squarely in front of them to seal a playoff spot. The Orioles look to remain unbeaten against the Tampa Bay Rays at home this season when they host their AL East rivals on Thursday in the opener of a four-game set. Baltimore, which trails first-place Boston by one game in the division, has recorded seven straight wins \xe2\x80\x93 six in 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 against the Rays at Camden Yards and owns one of the best records at home in the major leagues (45-25). The Orioles host Boston next week after attempting to improve on an 11-4 record versus last-place Tampa Bay, which is coming off its first road series win since July 18-20. Baltimore leads the majors with 232 homers while the Rays belted a pair in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 8-1 triumph at Toronto to set a franchise record with 200 blasts. Corey Dickerson has launched 20 of those and has been hot of late, going 16-for-31 with eight RBIs during his eight-game hitting streak. TV: 7:05 p.m. ET, FSN Sun (Tampa Bay), MASN (Baltimore) PITCHING MATCHUP: Rays LH Blake Snell (5-8, 3.62 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Yovani Gallardo (5-7, 5.44) Snell has lost three of his last four starts and did not complete four innings in any of those defeats. The Seattle native, who has not finished six frames in seven of his last eight outings, has served up five homers in 16 games but walked 45 in 77 innings overall. Snell, who will face Baltimore for the first time in his career, is 3-3 in seven starts against AL East opponents during his rookie campaign. Gallardo has permitted three or fewer earned runs in seven of his last nine contests but is just 2-5 in that stretch. The 30-year-old Mexican won at Tampa Bay last time out to snap a four-game losing streak, yielding two runs \xe2\x80\x93 one earned \xe2\x80\x93 and five hits in five innings. Dickerson is 5-for-11 with a homer versus Gallardo, who is 3-1 with a 3.55 ERA in six career starts against the Rays. WALK-OFFS 1. Tampa Bay 3B Evan Longoria, who is batting .193 with three homers against Baltimore this season, is one away from his career high of 33 blasts set in 2009. 2. Baltimore RF Mark Trumbo reached 100 RBIs for the second time in his career on Wednesday with his major league-leading 42nd homer. 3.

09/16/2016,"[('Wade Miley hasn\\u2019t been nearly as bad as he\\u2019s looked ...', ' When the Orioles traded for Wade Miley at the end of July, they expected to get a mediocre innings-eater to slot into the back of the rotation. While nobody was under the impression that Miley is a star, it was reasonable to think he\xe2\x80\x99d improve the team by filling that spot with an ERA that started with a four or a five instead of a six or a seven.    Instead, his performance since joining the Orioles has been a nightmare. Through eight starts since the trade, Miley is 1-5 with a 8.41 ERA. His magnum opus was a four-out, eight-hit, six-run train wreck of a start that practically ended Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game in the second inning. So, the results have been bad. No argument there. Our own Tyler Young wrote on Tuesday that he should be removed from the rotation, and that may very well happen. Even if Miley improves, giving up Ariel Miranda may turn out to be a mistake. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that before. When it comes to Miley\xe2\x80\x99s status in the rotation, though, I personally think he should stay where he is. Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s been bad, but he\xe2\x80\x99s been incredibly unlucky, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a better bet to pitch capably over the next few starts than Yovani Gallardo.    Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with his peripherals. In his eight starts with the Orioles, Miley has a K/9 of 8.15 and a BB/9 of 3.31. That\xe2\x80\x99s actually not terrible, and significantly better than Gallardo\xe2\x80\x99s numbers over either the full season (6.14 and 4.65) or the period since Miley was acquired (5.45 and 3.72).    Those peripherals, combined with his mediocre 47.9% ground ball rate, give Miley a surprisingly decent xFIP of 3.98. Essentially, xFIP is a measure of what a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s ERA \xe2\x80\x9cshould\xe2\x80\x9d be with an average defense, factoring in how often hitters strike out, walk, and put the ball in the air. Nobody claims xFIP is a perfect stat, and some pitchers consistently under-perform or out-perform their peripherals. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that there\xe2\x80\x99s some luck involved when a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s ERA is more than double their xFIP.    Moving on to FIP, that number jumps by nearly a full run to 4.81. Why? Because FIP uses HR/9 instead of fly ball percentage. While xFIP assumes that a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s HR/FB is random (which it mostly is), FIP doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Miley has a 20.7% HR/FB rate with the Orioles, meaning more than 1 in 5 fly balls against him have left the yard. That\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly high. League average is about 10%, and there are zero qualified starters with a HR/FB over 20% this year. Out of the 125 pitchers with 100+ innings, and there\xe2\x80\x99s just one: Jon Niese. Even if we expand that sample to pitchers with 30+ innings (Miley has thrown 35 innings for the O\xe2\x80\x99s), only eight out of 205 have a HR/FB higher than Miley.    That\xe2\x80\x99s one indicator of bad luck, but we can do better. Let\xe2\x80\x99s move on to the next of the classic \xe2\x80\x9cluck\xe2\x80\x9d stats when it comes to pitching: batting average on balls in play (BABIP). Miley has allowed a .409 BABIP with the Orioles. That is...insane. League average is around .300. The highest BABIP for a qualified starter is .358. Of the 205 pitchers with at least 30 innings pitched this season, only Tim Lincecum has allowed a BABIP over .400, an even-more-insane .432. The next-highest isn\xe2\x80\x99t even close - it\xe2\x80\x99s Cody Anderson of the Indians at .386.  In fact, if you look at the past ten years, there are 2106 pitcher-seasons of at least 30 innings pitched. How many have had a BABIP higher than .409? One. Lincecum, this year. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s from defensive miscues (such as Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s pair of misplays on Monday), or just plain hitting \xe2\x80\x98em where they ain\xe2\x80\x99t, basically everything is falling in against Miley right now. Let\xe2\x80\x99s move on to one final statistic: LOB%. This is another one that\xe2\x80\x99s primarily influenced by luck. Pitchers tend to strand around 70% of runners on average, and deviations from that are mostly related to sequencing.     A pitcher can give up seven hits in a game and pitch a shutout if he allowed them all in different innings. If all those hits are concentrated over a few innings, though, that same seven-hit performance could result in five or six runs, even if the pitcher didn\xe2\x80\x99t really pitch any worse overall. To see how big of an effect this can have, look at Miguel Gonzalez. Gonzalez had a 4.46 xFIP in 2014 and a 4.48 xFIP in 2015. By that metric, he was the exact same pitcher both years. But he had a 3.23 ERA in 2014 and a 4.91 ERA in 2015. Why? He stranded 85.5% of runners in 2014, the highest percentage in all of baseball by almost 3%. Everybody knew that LOB% was unsustainable, and Gonzo predictably regressed the next year. So, how about Miley? You guessed it - his LOB% with the Orioles is ridiculously low at 57.1%. There is no qualified starter with a LOB% below 65. There is one pitcher with at least 30+ innings with a LOB% lower than Miley\xe2\x80\x99s, and it\xe2\x80\x99s Jose Berrios of the Twins at 54.4%.  Just like Miley, Berrios has a sky-high ERA that\xe2\x80\x99s nearly double his xFIP. You get the picture. The three classic stats that we use to evaluate the effect of \xe2\x80\x9cluck\xe2\x80\x9d on pitching are HR/FB, LOB% and BABIP. Not only has Miley been terrible in all three categories, he\xe2\x80\x99s been historically terrible in all three.     Now, I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking. These stats aren\xe2\x80\x99t all luck. Some pitchers can sustain above- or below- average numbers in these categories, you say. Some pitchers are able to consistently induce harder or softer contact. That\xe2\x80\x99s true, but not nearly to this degree. Miley does appear to be one of those guys. His career BABIP is a tad high at .309, and his career HR/FB is 11.6%, also a little higher than average. So, yes, it does seem like batters do square him up a little more than other pitchers when they make contact. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Miley has underperformed his peripherals throughout his career. Generally, his ERA has tended to be about a half-run higher than his xFIP (4.23 vs. 3.87 overall). Based on that, given his xFIP of 3.98 since joining the Orioles, we\xe2\x80\x99d expect Miley\xe2\x80\x99s ERA to be about 4.50. Instead, he\xe2\x80\x99s had what could legitimately be one of the unluckiest 35-inning stretches of the past decade. Fly balls are leaving the yard instead of going to the warning track. Balls are finding gaps all over the place, when they aren\xe2\x80\x99t being misplayed by outfielders. The hits he\xe2\x80\x99s allowed have been strung together in big innings where they can do the most damage. Everything that could go wrong, has gone wrong. The results might say otherwise, but Miley has pitched exactly like the guy the Orioles thought they were getting. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been great, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly been this bad. He\xe2\x80\x99s not a star, but he\xe2\x80\x99s - as Dan Duquette would say - a capable major league starter. He deserves a chance to remain in the rotation and prove it.

09/17/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: A new star is Bourn in the outfield', 'It took a relay throw from Michael Bourn in the outfielder to nail a runner at the plate for the Baltimore Orioles to finally put Tampa out of their misery.The Baltimore Orioles just acquired outfielder Michael Bourn a few weeks ago, but if he does nothing else in an Oriole uniform he\xe2\x80\x99ll have already made a huge impact. The Birds had slowly crawled back into a game in which they had trailed from the beginning last night against a team in Tampa that they needed to and should have beaten. However Tampa, the masters of\xc2\xa0anything you can do I can do better, just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away. Alexi Ramirez\xe2\x80\x99s ninth-inning single with two outs appeared to be their normal shennanigans in that it appeared to be a game-tying play.Ubaldo Jimenez struggled early, but righted himself last night. However at the time, it appeared the damage might have already been done. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7.0 IP, 7 H, 4 R, 0 BB, 8 K. Jimenez might have been getting too much of the plate if anything \xe2\x80\x93 evidenced by two-run homers by Longoria and Shaffer in the first and second innings respectively.However the O\xe2\x80\x99s began to get back in the game in the last of the second when Pedro Alvarez smacked a solo home run. Chris Davis followed suit two innings later, hitting his \xc2\xa0solo shot to the opposite field. Hyun-Soo Kim\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single in the seventh brought the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within one, and Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent RBI-single an inning later tied the game at four.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireHowever it was Bourn who gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s the lead, and who would eventually preserve that lead. His eighth inning sac fly-RBI scored the go-ahead run, and the Orioles led 5-4. However there was still some late drama in this game, and at the end of the day both Bourn and the entire Orioles team were up to the task.With two outs in the ninth inning, closer Zach Britton had Alexei Ramirez with a full count \xe2\x80\x93 down to his final strike. As if Tampa hasn\xe2\x80\x99t caused the Orioles enough problems by running down all of their would-be extra-base hits and so forth, Ramirez sent a tight grounded past third. With a runner at second base, it appeared that the game was going to be tied and that Britton was going to blow his first save of the season\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6it\xc2\xa0appeared that way, at least. With almost cat-like reflexes, Bourn hustled over to the ball and dug it out of the corner. Mike Mahtook (the runner at second) didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the best read on the ball and held up a bit \xe2\x80\x93 giving Bourn time to get to it. Bourn made a near-perfect throw to Manny Machado at third, who relayed it home to catcher Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and\xc2\xa0BOOM! Mahtook was out at home plate. That\xe2\x80\x99s how the game ended, and the Orioles kept pace in the chase for October. The key to that play is Bourn getting to the ball as expediantly as he did, and then making such a great throw. And it really illustrates why Buck Showalter is so big on defense. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a part of the game that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to sacrifice.More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerThat might be as big of an individual play as the Orioles have made this season. You never want to say that the Birds are in a spot where they need to win the rest of their games, because that\xe2\x80\x99s neither true nor possible. However many of these other teams refuse to lose, putting pressure on the Birds. With the line between success and failure this year being so fine, it\xe2\x80\x99s plays like that which you need in your favor to keep the season going.And as I said above, it was almost Zach Britton\xe2\x80\x99s first blown save of the season. Brad Brach actually got the win (as the pitcher of record when Bourn gave the Birds the lead), however Britton came in during the ninth inning. As good as Britton\xe2\x80\x99s been, he probably deserved to have his streak saved by someone else in that spot. And Bourn was most definitely up to the challenge.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Late comeback attempt fails as Birds fall to TampaThe series continues this evening at Oriole Park.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Wins and losses have been elusive for Jake Odorizzi, who\'s experienced a very strange season with the Tampa Bay Rays.Odorizzi pitched well enough to win Sunday, yet the result was familiar: a no-decision in the Rays\' 2-1 defeat against the Baltimore Orioles.It was the 16th start in which Odorizzi received neither a win nor a loss. The right-hander allowed one run and five hits in six innings, striking out three and walking none.He\'s got a fine 3.73 ERA and has allowed two runs or fewer 20 times this year, but owns an unspectacular 9-6 record.""Over time we\'re going to win a lot of those ball games,"" manager Kevin Cash said.Odorizzi can\'t do anything about it but shrug his shoulders, grab the ball every fifth day and hope for the best.""I honestly don\'t think about it,"" he said. ""I try to keep us close every time. Not lose us the game. As long as that doesn\'t happen, it\'s a quality outing. It\'s a funky thing but no-decisions are a lot better than losses, the last time I checked.""Mark Trumbo hit his major league-leading 43rd homer to break an eighth-inning tie and provide Baltimore with a much-needed win.Manny Machado also connected for the Orioles, who lead the majors with 236 home runs. Baltimore salvaged a split of the four-game series against the last-place Rays and improved to 16-47 when scoring three runs or fewer.""We needed two runs to win today because we pitched real well,"" manager Buck Showalter said, ""and we got them.""After missing two straight games with back spasms, Trumbo returned with a flourish. With one out in the eighth, the Orioles\' cleanup hitter drove the first pitch from Ryan Garton (1-1) far over the center-field wall, his career-high 101st RBI of the season.""This time of year, someone\'s got to step up at some point in the game,"" Trumbo said. ""It was a well-played game, but we just needed to get that hit there at the end. So it was nice.""Brad Brach (10-3) pitched the eighth and Zach Britton got three outs for his 45th save in 45 tries. After Tampa Bay got a runner to second with one out against Britton, the lefty struck out pinch-hitter Logan Forsythe and retired Alexei Ramirez on a grounder to shortstop.Corey Dickerson homered for the Rays, extending the team\'s streak of games with a long ball to 14. The drive put Tampa Bay ahead 1-0 in the fifth inning.Odorizzi left with the score 1-all. He\'s 6-1 since July 10.""Can\'t be happier with the way Jake battled today,"" Cash said.Orioles starter Wade Miley allowed one single over four shutout innings, then left with a mild muscle strain in his upper back after warming up in the fifth.That put an end to perhaps his best performance since joining Baltimore on July 31. The left-hander was 1-5 with an 8.41 ERA in eight starts as an Oriole.Miley was replaced by Darren O\'Day, who was activated from the disabled list before the game. The sidearmer\'s first pitch since Aug. 11 was hit by Dickerson into the left-field seats.Tampa Bay loaded the bases with one out in the sixth against Donnie Hart before Dickerson hit into a double play.Machado led off the bottom half with his career-high 36th home run and fourth in 32 career at-bats against Odorizzi.IT\'S A STEALRays CF Kevin Kiermaier stole his 18th consecutive base in the fourth inning.

The time is now for the Baltimore Orioles, whose hopes to win the American League East hinge on their four-game series against the first-place Boston Red Sox beginning Monday at Camden Yards. Baltimore took two of three at Boston last week but only managed to split its four-game set against last-place Tampa Bay and sits three games behind the Red Sox with 13 remaining. The Orioles, who hold a one-game edge over Toronto for the top wild-card spot, used the long ball to edge the Rays 2-1 on Sunday as Manny Machado went deep in the sixth inning to forge a tie before Mark Trumbo launched his major league-leading 43rd of the season two frames later to snap the tie. Boston took out its frustrations of losing back-to-back contests against Baltimore by sweeping a four-game set with the New York Yankees over the weekend. Hanley Ramirez had quite the series, going 9-for-16 with four home runs and nine RBIs while opening and closing the set with game-winning blasts. The Red Sox still have a chance to finish with the most wins in the AL, as they trail Texas (88) by only three with Cleveland in between (86). PITCHING MATCHUP: Red Sox RH Rick Porcello (20-4, 3.12 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Dylan Bundy (9-5, 3.88) Porcello looks to avenge a rare loss after he had his six-game winning streak snapped by the Orioles on Wednesday despite allowing just one run and four hits over eight innings. The 27-year-old native of New Jersey has suffered three of his four defeats this season on the road but has won three straight decisions away from home. Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s setback dropped Porcello\xe2\x80\x99s career record against Baltimore to 3-8 in 14 starts but lowered his ERA versus the division rival to 5.19. Bundy will be making his 13th consecutive start after beginning the season with 22 appearances out of the bullpen. The 23-year-old from Oklahoma has won six of his last eight decisions, with four of the victories coming against division leaders. One was recorded at Boston on Tuesday, when Bundy evened his record at 1-1 in six career games (two starts) versus the Red Sox despite giving up three runs on six hits and four walks in 5 1/3 innings. WALK-OFFS 1. Red Sox DH David Ortiz was rested on Sunday but is expected to be in the lineup against Baltimore. 2. Trumbo has hit safely in eight of his last nine contests and 14 of 16 this month. 3. The season series has been tight thus far, with Baltimore holding a slight 8-7 edge.

However, the starting pitching had another solid series and it came from an unlikely source in the series finale.Wade Miley put together a solid outing on Sunday before being pulled because of back spasms. Many did not want to see Miley start another game after his last few outings, but Buck Showalter had a plan. Miley pitched Sunday so that Showalter could set his front of the rotation guys up for the important series against Boston. His plan worked and the Orioles have the chance to make up ground on the only team ahead of them.Dylan Bundy will get the start tonight, coming off a three-run outing against the Red Sox his last time out. The right hander has not been as crisp as of late, sporting a 6.27 ERA in his past four starts. That\xe2\x80\x99s troublesome for Baltimore as the Red Sox will send Rick Porcello to the mound, who was masterful in his last start against the O\xe2\x80\x99s, but lost on a solo home run by Mark Trumbo.Speaking of Trumbo, he returned to the lineup on Sunday after missing two games because of his own back spasms, and hit a go-ahead blast in the eighth inning. It was the 43rd home run for Trumbo, retaking the Major League lead in the category.The series against Boston could go along way in determine who wins the division. The Orioles have an excellent opportunity to make up ground on the Red Sox and earn a series instead of the one-game playoff. A series loss would not only hamper those hopes, but could see them fall out of the playoff picture.Next: Long Ball, Bullpen Helps Tighten AL East RaceThe AL East could be in for a major shakeup this week.

09/20/2016,"[('Let\\u2019s talk about the attendance at Camden Yards', ' At this point, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way to avoid talking about it: The attendance at Camden Yards lately has not been good. We get it. Every publication has written a story. Every upset uncle has typed a Facebook rant. We heard you. Loud and clear.     Last night, the Orioles lost 5-2 to the Red Sox in a pretty important game at home. They did so in front of 18,456 fans; a good chunk of which were supporting the visitors. Oriole Park holds about 45,000 people. So, that was disappointing in many ways. And to hear chants of \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go Red Sox!\xe2\x80\x9d at several points in the game was enough to make any Birds fan a little miffed.  Of course, I observed all of this from the comfort of my couch. So, believe me, I\xe2\x80\x99m not pointing fingers. We\xe2\x80\x99re just talking here. Ya know, like friends.  The stats I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at BaseballReference.com for all of this information. According to BR, prior to last night\xe2\x80\x99s game, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a total attendance this season of 1,976,194, which is an average of 26,705 per game. Both of those numbers sit them in 20th place of Major League Baseball, the lowest standing of any \xe2\x80\x9ccontending\xe2\x80\x9d team.    At this point last season, the Birds had drawn 2,165,296 in attendance. That is an average of 29,261 per game. If I\xe2\x80\x99m doing the math right (I\xe2\x80\x99m probably not), that is about a nine percent decrease from a year ago.     On paper, that makes no sense. The 2016 version of the Orioles already has more wins than 2015\xe2\x80\x99s team did and there are still two weeks to go. So, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t people heading to the park? More numbers Well, if we keep looking at numbers, we see that attendance is down across the league. There have been 566,649 fewer people at baseball games this summer when compared to last. Of course, across every game that number is a negligible 253 people each night.    Breaking it down team-by-team though, 18 of the 30 MLB teams have seen fewer fans at the park this year, including the defending World Series champion Royals, NL East-leading Nationals, Wild Card-contending Tigers and the consistently fantastic Cardinals. The O\xe2\x80\x99s aren\xe2\x80\x99t alone in playing good baseball, but failing to draw fans. On top of that, the Orioles have really good television ratings. I know. I know. That is a very common, very lame, and yet quite logical, reason. Forbes had them as the fourth-best local market in the country just after the All-Star break, and I doubt it has changed much since then. Baltimore still cares. It just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t translated to the turnstiles...or, ya know, those little scanner things. What\xe2\x80\x99s up? I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure of the cause. You tell me. We can hypothesize all we want. Steve Cockey did a really nice summary of many reasons for BaltimoreBaseball.com a couple of weeks ago. And, in reality, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t just one reason alone. It\xe2\x80\x99s all of them.    If we want to focus on just one game, like last night\xe2\x80\x99s duel with the Red Sox, it seems like there are a lot of easy answers: it was a weeknight, the kids are back in school, no giveaway, poor weather, prime game which means more expensive tickets, the TV product is so great, yada, yada, yada. It becomes a tad harder to put together reasons for the entire season. To me, the two big ones have to be the cost of going to the games and this summer\xe2\x80\x99s weather. It was unrelentingly hot in Maryland and the O\xe2\x80\x99s bumped up the cost of tickets this season. But with the team\xe2\x80\x99s relatively good play on the field, those seem like pretty minor reasons to keep away nearly a tenth of the game-going fanbase. One final reason Honestly, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you why exactly more people aren\xe2\x80\x99t attending ballgames. But here is my best guess at another factor: they just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to. Why? They expect a better product on the field, as greedy as that may seem. There are a lot of good things about the Orioles. They hit dongs. Manny Machado is one of the best in the game. Adam Jones is the greatest centerfielder in franchise history. Kevin Gausman is turning a corner. And Zach Britton is putting together one of the most incredible seasons by a reliever EVER. But is this a great team that you can reasonably see winning the World Series without a LOT of things working out that probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t?  Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong. They could certainly do it. But this is a club with a lot of holes. The outfield defense can be real bad. The starting pitching, while competent lately, has been abhorrent for long stretches. And the offense seems to randomly fall asleep if they don\xe2\x80\x99t hit a home run.    Maybe Baltimore fans are just THAT fair-weathered. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want \xe2\x80\x9ccompetitive\xe2\x80\x9d anymore, they want outright winners. The dark, 14-year-long cloud is gone and a distant memory for some. This organization has been a \xe2\x80\x9cwinner\xe2\x80\x9d for five years now and has recently been to an ALCS. The next step is the World Series, not simply getting to the crapshoot that is the Wild Card game. The fans pay attention. The decision to basically stand pat this winter, save for a Yovani Gallardo/Wei-Yin Chen swap and a buy-low Mark Trumbo trade, raised some eyebrows. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the O\xe2\x80\x99s won\xe2\x80\x99t dip their toe too far into free agency. But it is also widely known that the minor league cupboard is relatively barren. You can see how a fanbase gets discourage despite recent success. Of course, I do think that fans should be getting out to the games to support the Orioles in force. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not my money to spend. If the O\xe2\x80\x99s can hold on and make it to the playoffs, Camden Yards will be stuffed. If they prove me wrong and make a World Series run, it could stay that way come next regular season. Maybe I am totally off base with all of this. It seems like a topic that stirs a ton of conversation, so go for it. Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t more people going to Orioles games?

The American League East race is gaining more definition this week, and the Boston Red Sox are emerging as the clear favorites. The Red Sox will try to add to their division lead and trim their magic number to eight when they visit the Baltimore Orioles for the second of a four-game series on Tuesday. Boston knocked the New York Yankees out of the race with a four-game sweep over the weekend and set about doing the same to the Orioles with a 5-2 victory in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s series opener. Mookie Betts continued his domination of Baltimore with a two-run blast and David Ortiz homered as well for the Red Sox, who are now four games ahead of the Orioles with 12 left in the regular season. Baltimore had a chance to get back into the division race with a strong series but ensured that it will be in no better than second place when the weekend rolls around with a loss in the opener, leaving the wild card race a more pressing concern. The Orioles remain in a battle with the Toronto Blue Jays for the top wild card spot, with the Detroit Tigers and the Seattle Mariners lurking close behind. PITCHING MATCHUP: Red Sox LH Eduardo Rodriguez (2-7, 4.98 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (8-10, 3.43) A potential third spot in the Boston postseason rotation behind Rick Porcello and David Price is up for grabs, and Rodriguez did not do much to distinguish himself last time out. The 23-year-old Venezuelan could not make it through three innings and was ripped for four runs on eight hits by the New York Yankees on Thursday. Rodriguez tossed four hitless innings at Baltimore on Aug. 16 before leaving with tightness in his hamstring and is 1-3 with a 4.30 ERA in six career starts against the Orioles. Gausman had no trouble with the powerful Red Sox offense on Wednesday, when he scattered four hits over eight scoreless innings to outduel Porcello in a 1-0 Baltimore win. Gausman is 5-0 in his last six starts and held the opposition scoreless in four of his past five outings. The LSU product has not served up a home run in any of his last five starts and is 3-3 with a 4.01 ERA in 13 career games \xe2\x80\x93 eight starts \xe2\x80\x93 against Boston. WALK-OFFS 1. Betts is batting .500 with eight home runs and 15 RBIs in seven games at Baltimore this season. 2. Orioles OF/1B Steve Pearce, who was placed on the 60-day disabled list, will have surgery on Wednesday to repair flexor tendons in his right arm. 3.

So we\xe2\x80\x99ve elected a representative from each team to serve as fantasy baseball\xe2\x80\x99s most intriguing players for 2017.AMERICAN LEAGUEBaltimore Orioles: SP Dylan Bundy. Moving from the bullpen to the rotation after the All-Star break, Bundy has done the opposite of what generally happens: He has pitched better. The ERA is higher, but key indicators \xe2\x80\x94 a .231 opponents\xe2\x80\x99 batting average, 9.3 strikeouts per nine innings \xe2\x80\x94 show the 23-year-old is ready for a larger role.Boston Red Sox: C Sandy Leon. He has a wide range of potential outcomes. He could revert to the player who hit .184/.238/.202 (batting average/on-base percentage/slugging percentage) in 114 at-bats last season. Or he could build on this season: .339/.395/.527 with seven homers and 34 RBI in 224 at-bats.Chicago White Sox: SS Tim Anderson. Known for his basestealing ability in the minors (49 steals, five homers in 2015 in Class AA), he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t run very much in his rookie season \xe2\x80\x94 10 steals in 12 attempts. On the other hand, he has shown more power than expected (seven homers). One thing\xe2\x80\x99s for sure: He\xe2\x80\x99ll need to improve his ratio of 101 strikeouts to 10 walks.Cleveland Indians: RP Andrew Miller. He has set a career high for strikeouts (111 through Sunday) and is on pace for career lows in ERA (1.59) and WHIP (0.72). But as a setup man for most of the season, he has 12 saves. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say what his role will be next year, but he\xe2\x80\x99s worth targeting.Detroit Tigers: SP Daniel Norris. With a career-high 11 strikeouts against the Minnesota Twins on Sept. 12, Norris displayed some youthful upside that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find on this veteran club.Houston Astros: 3B Yulieski Gurriel. The 32-year-old Cuban has adjusted quickly to pitchers in the majors, hitting .321 with three homers and 13 RBI since joining the Astros on Aug. 21. Remember, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t play last year with his status in limbo. And he was a .335/.417/.580 hitter with 250 homers over 15 seasons in Cuba (and part of one in Japan).Kansas City Royals: 3B Mike Moustakas.

But this year\xe2\x80\x99s 11.8% walk rate is a huge step forward. Swinging at better pitches has led to 11 home runs in 134 at-bats and a .507 slugging percentage.Tampa Bay Rays: SS-1B Brad Miller. In three seasons with Seattle, Miller\xe2\x80\x99s career high in home runs was 11. This year, he\xe2\x80\x99s knocking on the door to 30. His average and on-base percentage have suffered as a result, but the huge jump in power seems worth it.Texas Rangers: 3B Jurickson Profar.

He qualifies only at third base so far, but he has played at least 15 games at first, second and third and in the outfield plus another 10 at shortstop.Toronto Blue Jays: 2B Devon Travis.

09/26/2016,"[('Orioles prospect season in review: Mike Yastrzemski ...', ' After the end of the 2014 season, Mike Yastrzemski was beginning to look like one of the rare overachievers in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 minor league system. Originally an unheralded 14th round pick in 2013, Yastrzemski put himself on the map with his play during his first two professional seasons.    After slashing .273/.362/.420 for Aberdeen in 2013, Yaz started the 2014 season in Delmarva. He tore up the Sally League to the tune of a .306/.365/.554 line in 63 games, then continued to hit well after a promotion to Frederick.  By the end of the year, he was in Bowie, and where he managed a roughly league-average .250/.310/.413 line over his final 43 games. His overall performance in 2014 was enough to put him on some organizational top prospect lists, where he generally resided in the bottom part of the top 20. Fangraphs had Yaz ranked 17th on their organizational list heading into 2015, summing him up by stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe tools aren\xe2\x80\x99t great but he gets the most out of them.\xe2\x80\x9d That quote seems to be the consensus with Yastrzemski. Read any write-up of Yastrzemski as a prospect and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the same general theme.     He makes up for mediocre bat speed with a good knowledge of the strike zone. His instincts in the outfield provide him with more range than you\xe2\x80\x99d expect from his average speed. His arm strength isn\xe2\x80\x99t great, but he\xe2\x80\x99s accurate and has a quick release. It\xe2\x80\x99s all the same idea - basically, that he\xe2\x80\x99s better than he looks.    Yastrzemski spent the full 2015 season in Bowie, but he never took the next step to improve on his brief double-A stint from the year before. He had almost the exact same batting line (.246/.316/.372), and remained at the double-A level to begin this year. This time around, he got the job done. Through 33 games, an .810 OPS was enough to get him promoted to Norfolk. But, as many do upon hitting triple-A for the first time, Yastrzemski struggled the rest of the way.    Over 385 plate appearances for the Tides, Yaz hit just .221/.312/.369. On the bright side, he finished the season with 13 homers (7 in triple-A), compared to just six in 2015.  But the biggest problem for him this season was simple: a 25.5% strikeout rate that was far higher than what he\xe2\x80\x99s done in the past. After such a hot start to his pro career, the past two years have done little to improve or even maintain his prospect status. He currently sits at 17th on the MLB.com list, and SB Nation\xe2\x80\x99s own Minor League Ball has him ranked outside of the top 20. Next year will be the key for Yastrzemski. A full season in Triple-A will show whether this year was just a bump in the road in adjusting to a new level, or whether he\xe2\x80\x99s gone as far as his tools can take him.    If he can improve at the plate in 2017, Yaz could become a 4th or 5th outfielder - a decent bat off the bench who is capable of playing all three outfield positions in a pinch.  An MLB 4th outfielder would still be good value for a 14th round pick, so even if that\xe2\x80\x99s his ceiling, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with that. We still don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he can get to that level, but he\xe2\x80\x99s 26 now, so the O\xe2\x80\x99s need to figure it out soon. One way or another, the 2017 season will probably tell us whether Yastrzemski has the potential to contribute at the Major League level. Considering the dearth of offensive prospects in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 system, let\xe2\x80\x99s hope the answer to that question is yes.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
09/27/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Colin Kaepernick conundrum in ...', 'What type of affect are Colin Kaepernick\xe2\x80\x99s actions having on MLB, the Baltimore Orioles, and in all of sports as a whole?Adam Jones of the Baltimore Orioles was one of the few baseball players to respond to Colin Kaepernick and his National Anthem protestation. You might have noticed that this was one of the few sports columns that didn\xe2\x80\x99t cover this in some way when it first broke. That\xe2\x80\x99s because first off the Orioles were and still are in the middle of a playoff race. But also because it\xe2\x80\x99s tough for me to separate my own personal thoughts and beliefs and to keep journalistic integrity when it comes to matters involving the flag or the national anthem.But I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a shot at it here, as the Orioles prepare to continue their hunt for October. As you might have gathered from above, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a fan of anyone disrespecting our flag or anthem under any circumstances. To me there are just some things that are more sacred than anything else \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s one of them.However there\xe2\x80\x99s little doubt that Mr. Kaepernick and others are within their rights to do it. Furthermore, I might even support the root of their cause in trying to stand for social justice. Heck, I suspect that the majority of the good and honest police officers (which is the vast majority of officers on forces nationwide) do as well. The last thing they want are a couple of bad apples giving them all bad names.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireBut in effect that message is lost on folks such as myself, as all we see is our nation\xe2\x80\x99s flag being disrespected by people using the very laws that the flag represents to do so. However that aside, it\xe2\x80\x99s not something we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in MLB as of yet. Although it\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s been addressed, very specifically by Adam Jones. While Jones said that he intended to stand for the anthem, he supported Kaepernick\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0right to sit or kneelIn truth, he has no choice \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s a right guaranteed to Kaepernick by the constitution. And in fact, if you want to see a country where \xe2\x80\x9cpatriotism\xe2\x80\x9d is forced, look no further than North Korea. However the more controversial aspect of Jones\xe2\x80\x99 comments were that nobody in baseball has followed suit because \xe2\x80\x9cbaseball is a white man\xe2\x80\x99s sport.\xe2\x80\x9d He received some backlash for those comments, but to his credit he attacked them head-on. And if his remarks were ever a story, that story has now passed.Interestingly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this \xe2\x80\x9cphenomenon\xe2\x80\x9d spread to other NFL sidelines, and even to other sports. And again, my point would be that there\xe2\x80\x99s a better way of protesting very legitimate causes than by disrespecting our nation overall. Last night the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints opted to join hands at midfield during the anthem in a show of unity for the cause of social justice. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the type of thing that gets the point across without disrespecting the flag or the country as a whole.However now I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to hear stories about high school teams pulling stunts like laying on the ground during the anthem, among other things. So\xe2\x80\xa6is there ever a point where this will run it\xe2\x80\x99s course? Are players/people doing this simply because it\xe2\x80\x99s fashionable at this point, or because they want to prove a point? Because at this point, I question whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s still news when someone pulls this stunt.More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerAnd there are some folks out there who will say\xc2\xa0what do you expect people to do to get society\xe2\x80\x99s attention\xc2\xa0and so forth. Colin Kaepernick did get everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and did create a national discussion. But in defending Kaepernick\xe2\x80\x99s right to do what he did, even President Obama said that it might have been best to leave the flag or the anthem out of the protestation \xe2\x80\x93 since people had died for that over the years. However again, I\xe2\x80\x99m\xc2\xa0NOT in anyway saying that Mr. Kaepernick doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the right to do what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing. He totally does \xe2\x80\x93 I just wish he did it in another way.And again, before people say that he wanted to do something that would kind of shock society, keep in mind that Martin Luther King (the greatest civil rights leader in history in my view) accomplished a lot more by marching from Selma and speaking at the Lincoln Memorial for the March on Washington. And mind you, all of his marches somehow included the American flag.Next: Baltimore Orioles restore order in the universe - for nowAre we now having the national debate that Kaepernick wanted? Yes I suppose we are. Mind you, police brutality and race relations are a problem in America, and there can be no question about that. But I feel that we should look to the example of Dr. King to fix those issues as opposed to the image of a multi-millionaire sitting on the bench during the national anthem. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
09/28/2016,"[('Orioles delivered to 3-2 victory by Hyun Soo Kim\\u2019s clutch ...', ' The game was all but lost, the season all but over. No hope remained for the Orioles in the middle of another pathetic offensive effort that saw them blow scoring chance after scoring chance, just an absolutely endless stream of miserable failure. Nothing good would be happening to the Orioles this night.    Then Hyun Soo Kim pinch hit in the ninth inning. Hyun Soo Kim, who the team tried to persuade to accept a minor league assignment back in spring training. Hyun Soo Kim, who was booed by some of the idiots of the Orioles fanbase back on Opening Day, not that many of them are likely to admit to having participated in that action now. Hyun Soo Kim, who hit a two-run home run on Sunday to power the Orioles to a 2-1 victory. Kim came to the plate with the tying run already on base, Jonathan Schoop having singled before him. During the at-bat, pinch runner Michael Bourn swiped second base, moving himself into scoring position with one out. After three pitches, Kim was down in a 1-2 hole against Jays closer Roberto Osuna. Although he\xe2\x80\x99s no Zach Britton, Osuna is no slouch, either, striking out nearly 30% of the batters he\xe2\x80\x99s faced this year, blowing a fastball that averages nearly 96mph past hitters.    Osuna attacked Kim with everything including the kitchen sink. Four-seam fastball, two-seam fastball, changeup, slider. Kim, with a practiced batting eye, laid off pitches far out of the zone, and with excellent contact skills, fouled off anything close to the zone. Foul ball, foul ball, foul ball, three in a row, and after eight pitches, Kim had worked his way to a 3-2 count.    Then came the payoff pitch. What Osuna meant to throw, only he will ever know, but what he threw was a fastball, 96 miles per hour, a bit below belt high, over the inside third of the plate. Kim swung with the swing that powered him to 28 home runs in the KBO last year. He looked, as my Camden Chat colleague Bill Duck described it, as if every fiber of his being and soul went into that swing. And Kim did not miss. The ball soared through the stale Toronto dome air. Jays right fielder and noteworthy whiner Jose Bautista retreated towards the wall as though he might have a play, but the ball kept carrying and carrying, finally clearing the wall and into an ecstatic Orioles bullpen.    The Orioles, after a game full of failure, a game that seemed destined for bitter disappointment, had their first lead of the night, at 3-2, with the perfect-in-2016 Zach Britton lined up for the bottom of the ninth inning. Britton, excellent gentleman that he is, swept up the bottom of the Jays lineup with a dustpan and deposited them in the nearest trash receptacle, an easy 1-2-3 inning for his 47th save of the season. Under no circumstances did the Orioles have any business winning this baseball game. If it had been a football game they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have deserved to win that either. Entering the ninth inning, they were 1-9 for the game with runners in scoring position and the lone hit did not result in a run crossing the plate. Even the out-of-town scoreboard was unkind, the Tigers winning a rain-delayed game, the Mariners having won earlier on Wednesday.    It was the kind of pathetic performance they\xe2\x80\x99ve been firing off all month - why their wild card cushion has shrunk to one game, why their division hopes got buried. They had a man in scoring position in the fourth, fifth, and seventh innings of the game, each time with one out or fewer, and they did not score in any of those chances against Jays starter Francisco Liriano, who, as a lefty, is of course the O\xe2\x80\x99s kryptonite. To make matters worse, sloppy play in the field cost them the two early runs by which they trailed. The Chris Davis/Tillman combination combined for two first inning errors that combined to leave leadoff man Ezequiel Carrera on third base with one out, where he scored on a sacrifice fly, because it turns out you can hit deep fly balls with less than two out, instead of striking out. Crazy. That 1-0 deficit was doubled in the second inning when another sacrifice fly, this one not particularly deep to right field, brought home Troy Tulowitzki from third base. Mark Trumbo did not make a strong throw and the Orioles paid for it. Tillman, though he was not great on the night, had one of those games where he battled despite not having his best stuff. Tillman held the Jays to just two runs, one earned, in 5.2 innings of work. That\xe2\x80\x99s because he was able to scatter six hits and three walks. Not ideal, and worrisome if he\xe2\x80\x99s not fully healed, as the MASN telecast openly speculated, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about that for one night. The 2-0 lead looked like it would hold for nearly the entire game as the Orioles flailed away in situation after situation, reaching double digit strikeouts before Liriano left the game with one out in the seventh inning.    Hold that lead did, at least until the eighth inning, when world home run champion Trumbo blasted a second deck shot over the left field fence, tagging struggling reliever Jason Grilli. That was Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s 46th home run of the year, futile as it may have then seemed. But you never really know what will end up mattering. Pinch hitter Pedro Alvarez followed with a double, putting the tying run in scoring position in the eighth, though there were two outs and Matt Wieters was unable to bring him home. So it came down to the ninth, down to the bottom of the lineup, down to Kim coming off the bench against the righty instead of letting Nolan Reimold bat again. Reimold, it must be said, made a couple of great catches in left field in the game to keep more Jays runs from scoring. Everything was terrible until suddenly, with one swing, it was awesome - for one night at least. This was a big win for the Orioles, but it probably won\xe2\x80\x99t amount to a hill of beans unless they win two of their final four games. Three of those games will be started by Ubaldo Jimenez, Yovani Gallardo, and, presumably though it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet announced, Wade Miley. The Orioles offense still has only scored more than three runs once in their last eleven games. They\xe2\x80\x99re still only a game ahead of the Tigers - assuming the Tigers win later - and the Tigers will play their final series of the year against the Braves. And even if the Orioles are the road wild card team, they just get one more game in Toronto, where they have been bad for two years!    Those are problems for another day. They can only win the game on the schedule that day. And if they can find a way to steal another game tomorrow, with Jimenez on the mound against Marcus Stroman in a 7:07 contest, they will leave Toronto tied for the home wild card spot. This was the biggest Orioles game of the season to date. Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s will be bigger still. Here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping they can find a way to triumph.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
09/29/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Hyun-Soo Kim saved his best for last', 'The Baltimore Orioles were all but done for in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game at Toronto; then Hyun-Soo Kim stepped to the plate as a pinch-hitter.Buck Showalter looked down the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bench in the ninth inning last night and found Hyun-Soo Kim. Showalter proceeded to tell Kim to grab a bat, as he was going to pinch hit for Nolan Reimold with the Orioles trailing 2-1 (all of this through his interpreter of course). This was an all-important game of course, and one the Orioles couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose.Kim had smacked a two-run homer previously on Sunday to lead the Orioles to victory over Arizona. Kim worked the count full with one on and one out. Then he sent a deep ine drive out towards Rogers Centre\xe2\x80\x99s right field area\xe2\x80\xa6Chris Tillman struggled a bit in what could be his penultimate stat of the season. However he also kept the Orioles in the game and left the in a spot to win. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.2 IP, 6 H, 2 R (1 earned), 3 BB, 2 K. The one unearned run came as a result of Ezequiel Carrera getting on board due to a Chris Davis fielding error. He advanced to third on a Tillman throwing error, and then scored on a sac fly-RBI by Encarnacion.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireKevin Pillar\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI in the second gave Toronto a 2-0 lead. And on we played \xe2\x80\x93 for some time. But the Orioles did get a couple of very key defensive plays over the course of the game. Nolan Reimold made two sliding catches preventing what would have been big hits for Toronto. In fact on his catch in the sixth he managed to double-up Jose Bautista, who had already pre-determined that the ball was going to fall in for a hit.However in these huge spots late in big games, bullpens usually come up big. And the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen did just that in relief of Tillman. Donnie Hart, Mychael Givens, Brian Duensing (who was credited with the win) and Zach Britton combined for just one walk and five strikeouts. And that left the door open for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 later heroics.The Birds brought the score to within 2-1 on Mark Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s solo homer in the eighth. But that\xe2\x80\x99s all the Orioles could put across in that inning. In the ninth Jonathan Schoop got aboard with a single, and Buck Showalter used Michael Bourn to pinch-hit \xe2\x80\x93 and he promptly stole second base. That\xe2\x80\x99s when Showalter looked down the bench to find Kim as a pinch hitter.\xe2\x80\xa6and by now, you know that the deep shot to right field cleared the wall and went into the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen. Kim\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer gave the Orioles a 3-2 lead, which turned into about as unlikely a 3-2 win as one can imagine after Zach Britton sent Toronto down 1-2-4 in the last of the ninth. So Hyun-Soo Kim, the guy that many people (myself included) felt shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been on the roster on Opening Day, possibly saved the season.Big time players make big time plays in the moment. And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Kim did in Toronto last night. That home run sent an Orioles team from the depths of despair to the elation of victory. In a year full of big moments, look no further than that one as possibly the biggest \xe2\x80\x93 if the Orioles are able to make it to the post-season.More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

They trimmed their magic number to four games with the win, however it didn\xe2\x80\x99t move any further because Detroit ended up beating Cleveland. However those two teams play a 1 PM matinee this afternoon \xe2\x80\x93 so it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that the magic number could be three before the Orioles even take the field tonight. Detroit then heads to Atlanta for their final series.Next: Baltimore Orioles desperately trying to stay above water in the playoff raceThe series at Rogers Centre concludes this evening. Ubaldo Jimenez will be on the mound for the Orioles, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Marcus Stroman. Game time is set for just after 7 PM. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
09/30/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Ubaldo Jimenez pitches Birds closer to ...', 'Ubaldo Jimenez pitched six plus innings of one-hit baseball as the Baltimore Orioles tied Toronto for the top wild card spot.As maligned as Ubaldo Jimenez has been by Baltimore Orioles fans over time, you have to admit that he normally shows up when he\xe2\x80\x99s needed most. I would point back to the 2014 AL East clincher against Toronto, where Jimenez started out of the bullpen and came up big for the Birds. He\xe2\x80\x99s also had several big starts over the past couple of weeks, which brought him and the Orioles to last night\xe2\x80\xa6,,,ironically against Toronto once again. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.2 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 3 BB, 5 K. Anytime a pitcher goes as long as Jimenez went into that game and tosses a one-hitter, he\xe2\x80\x99s really on his game. Jimenez certainly struggled for much of the 2016 season. However he\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99d call a big-game late-season pitcher. He steps it up when he needs to.Some fans might justifiably point out that perhaps had Jimenez been on his game earlier the Orioles might not still be trying to wrap up a playoff spot at this point. But the point is that when he\xe2\x80\x99s called in a big spot late in the year, Jimenez has proven that he shows up. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a good guy to have on your team.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireThe Orioles took a 1-0 lead in the third on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI. Michael Bourn grounded into a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice-RBI an inning later, and the Birds led 2-0. RBI-singles by Kim and Wieters in the seventh and eighth innings closed out the scoring, and the Birds took a 4-0 victory into the clubhouse.WIth the win, the Orioles are now tied with Toronto in the American League Wild Card standings. Whichever team finishes with the better win percentage will host the wild card game, which is scheduled for next Tuesday night. If the two teams finish tied, Toronto wins the tie-breaker. Toronto finishes their season in Boston, while the Orioles of course are down the pike in New York.Notice that I said the wild card game is\xc2\xa0scheduled\xc2\xa0for Tuesday. In theory that could be up in the air if tie-breakers come into play. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 magic number to clinch a playoff spot is three. However Detroit (who\xe2\x80\x99s chasing the Birds) was rained out yesterday at home in their game against Cleveland. That game would in theory be made up on Monday\xc2\xa0if it\xe2\x80\x99s needed.If the Orioles can eliminate Detroit before then, that game will be irrelevant. However if Detroit is still within a half-game of overtaking or tying the Orioles, it would need to be made up. And that\xe2\x80\x99s where it gets murky; if that game is made up on Monday and after the fact the Orioles (or Toronto for that matter) and Detroit are tied, then what happens? In that case they\xe2\x80\x99d have to play a tie-breaker game, which in reality would be\xc2\xa0regular season game 163.More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal2/17 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Johnson wants to revitalize his careerSo when does that happen? Obviously MLB has a nightmare scenario in that situation, because they\xe2\x80\x99d probably need to reshuffle the schedule a bit. However my prediction is that it won\xe2\x80\x99t be an issue. While Detroit is playing Atlanta this weekend, any combination of Orioles (or Toronto) wins and Detroit losses which equal three eliminates Detroit. So if the Birds take two-of-three in NYC and Detroit drops at least one game in Atlanta, that\xe2\x80\x99s the end of it.Obviously if the Orioles sweep the series in NY it would be over as well. So at this point I\xe2\x80\x99m predicting the Orioles as a playoff team, but without the theatrics which a lot of folks are saying could happen. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to look at it; if the Orioles and Atlanta win tonight, then an Oriole or an Atlanta win tomorrow will put the Orioles in the playoffs.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Hyun-Soo Kim saved his best for lastThe aforementioned penultimate series in New York begins tonight at Yankee Stadium. Yovani Gallardo gets the ball for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by New York\xe2\x80\x99s Michael Pineda. Game time is set for just after 7 PM \xe2\x80\x93 weather permitting. Oh, did I mention that the forecast in NY this weekend had it\xe2\x80\x99s toils and snares?! ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles wins in Toronto set up wild final weekend for wild ...', ' The Orioles really needed to find a way to win two out of three games against the Blue Jays in their most recent series and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what they did. This sets up a final weekend that\xe2\x80\x99s fairly simple. If the Orioles win more games against the Yankees than the Jays win against the Red Sox, the Orioles will host the wild card game. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t, Toronto will host it.    Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s not quite that simple just yet. Two other teams still lurk in the periphery of the race, hoping that if they win enough games and the Orioles or Jays lose enough games, that they can sneak their way back into the picture. Either the Tigers or Mariners are still in play for setting up some kind of weird tiebreaker scenario if the teams ahead of them stumble in one particular way. Sports Illustrated\xe2\x80\x99s Jay Jaffe is the standard bearer for what he calls Team Entropy, which spends each September celebrating the unlikely possibility of maximum wild card chaos. A four-way tie is not out of the question:   AL #TeamEntropy update:for tie at 88 wins: BAL & TOR 1-2, DET 3-1, SEA 4-087 wins: BAL & TOR 0-3, DET 2-2, SEA 3-1NYY, HOU: RIP\xe2\x80\x94 Jay Jaffe (@jay_jaffe) September 30, 2016    There could also potentially be a three way tie at 89 wins, if both the Orioles and Jays go 2-1 while the Tigers win out. Oh, and here\xe2\x80\x99s the kicker about that. The Tigers had a rainout on Thursday, which means that they will only play their 162nd game on Monday if necessary, so if things shake out this way, the O\xe2\x80\x99s won\xe2\x80\x99t even know their exact playoff fate until that game is over - a game that Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s opponent, the Indians, would likely have zero interest in trying too hard to win.    The Fangraphs standings projections now think that it will take 89 wins for both wild card spots in the AL. The Orioles need to win two games to get there.    Toronto Blue Jays  Standing: Home wild card team; holds tiebreaker over Orioles Last Game: Lost to Orioles, 4-0 Next series: at Red Sox (92-67), three games  Current playoff chances: 86.2% (down from 92.2 before Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s games) To reach 89 wins (WC1/2): 2-1  How much will the Red Sox be trying hard to win games when their playoff position is more or less locked in? They\xe2\x80\x99re two games behind the Rangers for home field in a potential ALCS between those two teams, and half a game ahead of the Indians for home field in a potential ALDS between those two teams. There\xe2\x80\x99s also the Final Home Regular Season Series for the Vandal, David Ortiz, to consider. Painful as it is to say, O\xe2\x80\x99s fans must root for the Red Sox for the next few days.    Baltimore Orioles  Standing: Road wild card team; 1.5 games ahead of Tigers Last Game: Beat Blue Jays, 4-0 Next series: at Yankees (83-76), three games Current playoff chances: 88.7% (up from 72.2) To reach 89 wins: 2-1  If the Orioles want to have any hope at all of hosting the wild card game, they\xe2\x80\x99ve probably got to win two games and they will maybe need to get a sweep. Two of their final three games will be started by Yovani Gallardo and Wade Miley. Wherever the Orioles end up in the postseason picture, or even if they end up outside of the postseason picture entirely, no one will be able to say that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t earn their place. They have overcome a lot to get where they are right now. Detroit Tigers  Standing: 1.5 games behind Orioles Last Game: MLB-gifted rain-shortened 6-3 win vs. Indians Next series: at Braves (66-92), three games Current playoff chances: 14.7% (down from 17.4) To reach 89 wins: 4-0  It\xe2\x80\x99s not great to look down and see that the closest team chasing the Orioles gets to play what\xe2\x80\x99s been one of the worst teams in baseball all year in its final series. The Braves are a bad baseball team. They have, however, had a nice run in September, going 16-9 for the month. Keep that up, Atlanta, so that the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait around for someone else to play a Monday game. Thanks.    Seattle Mariners  Standing: Two games behind Orioles Last Game: Beat Athletics, 3-2 Current series: vs. Athletics (67-92), three more games Current playoff chances: 10.4% (down from 16.8) To reach 89 wins: Can\xe2\x80\x99t reach 89 wins  If both the Orioles and Blue Jays win two games, these guys are out of the picture. They need a sweep of the Athletics and then they need to hope that either the O\xe2\x80\x99s or the Jays get swept or win only one game. It could happen. Baseball is weird. But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be feeling good if the Orioles were two games back with three to play, and for good reason. ** The Orioles magic number to clinch any postseason spot is three. That is a combination of Orioles wins and Tigers losses. They have a prime opportunity to pass the Jays, if they can play well against the Yankees. Just win, baby.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Three singers then stood on the first-base dugout and did a rendition of \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land Is Your Land,\xe2\x80\x9d the famous folk song written by Woody Guthrie.By the time the end of the third verse arrived \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cAll around me a voice was sounding, this land was made for you and me\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 fans had joined in.In a tradition that dates to the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror attacks in 2001, \xe2\x80\x9cGod Bless America\xe2\x80\x9d is played in major league ballparks around the country, including in Baltimore, during the seventh-inning stretch of Sunday games. The song can also be heard during assorted holiday games, and the Yankees play the song during the seventh inning of every home game.But Baltimore is the only major league franchise to regularly play \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land Is Your Land,\xe2\x80\x9d which it does at Friday home games. And the song, long considered an anthem of the left because of its populist themes, is meant to be more than a Camden Yards singalong. It is a subtle, yet intentional, message from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 management that at the intersection of sports and patriotism, one size does not have to fit all.

But, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a strain of progressivism in American life, and if we can reflect it, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles began occasionally playing Guthrie\xe2\x80\x99s song in the 2015 season. This year, they made it a staple on Fridays, which means it was in place before San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick focused attention on a nationwide debate when he declined to stand for the national anthem before an N.F.L. exhibition game in August.Kaepernick cited racial oppression as the reason for his action, which paved the way for symbolic gestures by other athletes, some who have knelt during the anthem, others who have linked arms while standing at attention and still others who have raised a clenched fist.Set against all this is Guthrie\xe2\x80\x99s song, which the Orioles, who finish the season at Yankee Stadium, will have a chance to play again this year only if the team makes it to the playoffs. Regardless, they plan to keep playing \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land\xe2\x80\x9d next season. In the meantime, Angelos is keeping a close eye on all the ripple effects created by Kaepernick.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The history of Guthrie\xe2\x80\x99s tune is linked to \xe2\x80\x9cGod Bless America,\xe2\x80\x9d which was written by Irving Berlin and then recorded by Kate Smith in 1938, when it became a hit at a time of uneasiness in the years leading up to World War II.Guthrie, who had spent years traveling the country during the Great Depression, had Communist sympathies and a different, more defiant, vision of the United States than the one conveyed in \xe2\x80\x9cGod Bless America.\xe2\x80\x9d As an answer to that song, he wrote \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land Is Your Land\xe2\x80\x9d in 1940.His original lyrics questioned the merits of private property and included lines that were never officially recorded: \xe2\x80\x9cBy the relief office, I saw my people. As they stood there hungry, I stood there wondering if this land was made for you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d Through the years, the song was popularized by Guthrie\xe2\x80\x99s son, Arlo, and others, including Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen.

Privacy Policy     John Shaw, the author of \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land That I Love,\xe2\x80\x9d a book about the two songs, said the two songwriters had more in common than meets the eye. Although \xe2\x80\x9cGod Bless America\xe2\x80\x9d has become associated with unvarnished patriotism, that was not Berlin\xe2\x80\x99s intent. When the song was written, Shaw said, it was Berlin\xe2\x80\x99s way of showing gratitude that he was no longer in Europe. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a love letter written by an immigrant to his adopted country,\xe2\x80\x9d Shaw said.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  As for Guthrie, Shaw noted that while the original lyrics were a sarcastic response to Berlin\xe2\x80\x99s song, \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land Is Your Land\xe2\x80\x9d evolved, too. \xe2\x80\x9cIt became a love song to America, too,\xe2\x80\x9d Shaw said.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, major league teams began playing Berlin\xe2\x80\x99s song as a show of patriotism. But Angelos also thought about how the Orioles could diversify the way they honored America. For instance, the team now has a program to honor community heroes at Friday, Saturday and Sunday home games. Photo       John Angelos, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 chief operating officer, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a strain of progressivism in American life, and if we can reflect it, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Credit             Todd Olszewski/Orioles           The core of the idea was to celebrate various citizens, and not just members of the military, and pair each day with a different song (\xe2\x80\x9cAmerica the Beautiful\xe2\x80\x9d is played on Saturdays). Last Friday, the community hero was a bus driver, Reneita Smith, who saved a group of elementary students from a burning school bus.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cPeople forget a lot of these stadiums are publicly funded buildings and, by law, they have to welcome people from all different walks of life,\xe2\x80\x9d Angelos said. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes sports can be narrowcast in the causes and groups focused on. Our idea is that everyone should be included; let\xe2\x80\x99s not leave anyone out.\xe2\x80\x9dThat the Orioles are taking this approach is not all that surprising. Peter Angelos made his fortune representing workers in asbestos cases. He refused to sign replacement players during the strike by players in 1994 and 1995, and he helped arrange for the Orioles to play a home-and-home series with the Cuban national team in 1999 at a time when there was no active relationship between the countries.

Jones, who recently said that athlete protests over the national anthem had not spread to baseball because of a lack of racial diversity in the sport, said he was not conversant with the song\xe2\x80\x99s political history.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Several fans, asked about the song\xe2\x80\x99s meaning last week, also pleaded ignorance. \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt most of our guys know who Woody Guthrie is,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Buck Showalter added.  For his part, John Angelos said it did not bother him that many fans and players may not know the song\xe2\x80\x99s origins because it was only one aspect of the community heroes program.\xe2\x80\x9cWe can honor a veteran, but we can also honor a veteran who is against a particular war,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat diversity is what the song represents.\xe2\x80\x9d  A version of this article appears in print on October 1, 2016, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: In Baltimore, This Song Is Their Song.

The Jays were down to their last out.\xe2\x80\x9cStrike him out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schoop, who had just driven in five runs against the Yankees. But his heart was not really in it. He left the room before the Red Sox obliged, lifting the Orioles into the top spot in the American League wild-card race. The Orioles have reason to be confident; if they keep winning, they will need no help to host a game at Camden Yards next week.With a soggy 8-1 victory over the Yankees in the Bronx \xe2\x80\x94 and the Blue Jays\xe2\x80\x99 5-3 loss at Fenway Park \xe2\x80\x94 the Orioles now stand a game ahead of the Blue Jays.

And that was a terrific at-bat by Kim.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Now the Orioles have won six of their last seven. At 88-72, they can clinch one of the wild-card spots with a victory on Saturday and a loss by the Detroit Tigers. That would be a tidier outcome than a slew of other possibilities.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  If Toronto pulls even with the Orioles at the end of the regular season, the Blue Jays will host the wild-card game on Tuesday because they won the teams\xe2\x80\x99 season series. But if Detroit is just a half-game ahead or behind after Sunday, the Tigers will have to make up a rained-out game against Cleveland on Monday. That could set up a three-way tie for two spots.Other possible outcomes are in play, too. The Seattle Mariners are still alive, and the Tigers, conceivably, could play five games in five cities from Sunday through Thursday. It is a lot to process.

And, while many think of the Orioles as an offensive team, in September it was the pitching that carried the team.How good was the pitching?In the month, the team ERA was 2.90. That was the BEST in baseball. The starters had an ERA of 3.83, sixth-best in the American League. The relievers had an ERA under 1.50, best in the American League.More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryThe BAA was .223, the second-best in the American League, and fourth-best in baseball.Another important stat is that the Baltimore Orioles had the lowest slugging percentage in all of Major League Baseball for the month. For a team that struggled with home runs allowed through the middle months, this was huge for the Baltimore Orioles.While we are digging into pitching stats, another interesting stat is that Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers threw the most pitches per plate appearance in baseball.The team, as mentioned earlier, won 16 games in the month. Starting pitchers won 12 of those, led by Ubaldo Jimenez and Dylan Bundy each winning three starts. Kevin Gausman and Yovani Gallardo both picked up two wins, with Wade Miley and Chris Tillman each winning once.Of the games won by relievers, one was an extra inning game with Oliver Drake getting the win, Brad Brach won two games (giving him ten wins on the year), and Brian Duensing picked up the huge win on Wednesday night against Toronto.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoEven though Miley and Tillman each only had one win, over the past week both had tremendous starts. Miley went 8 2/3 innings in a commanding performance against the Diamondbacks.Tillman was the starter in the game that Duensing ended up winning.Everyone knows of Ubaldo\xe2\x80\x99s contribution at this point, and Bundy did well despite not having the deepest of starts.Since being swept by the Red Sox, the opposition has scored 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 0, and 1 runs. That is an average of less than a run per game. That\xe2\x80\x99s not bad.While we are talking about keeping the opposition off the board, know that the Baltimore Orioles have the fourth-best fielding percentage in the game, and the fourth-fewest errors. The fielding percentage is just .001 worse than the three top teams, Detroit, Houston, and Boston.Next: Ravens: 5 Matchups to Watch vs. Oakland Raiders  So, while many people want to count the Orioles and their all-or-nothing offense out come playoff time if current form holds, the team is pitching very well also.That just might help the Orioles surprise many in the American League.

Manager Buck Showalter did not announce who will start that game, though right-handers Chris Tillman and Ubaldo Jimenez are the likeliest candidates.Baltimore won the inaugural AL wild card game in 2012, and advanced to the American League Championship Series in 2014. Since they lost Saturday, the Orioles had to burn their best starter, Gausman, to ensure advancement Sunday.     .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; }     p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYBlue Jays clinch final MLB playoff berthGausman was up to the task.

It was a go.Within seconds, a crew of maintenance workers descended on the visiting clubhouse with rolls of plastic wrap, tape and staple guns, feverishly erecting a protective wrapper around the roughly 900-square-foot room.But out on the field, the Yankees began a wild comeback in the bottom of the ninth inning, which Cucuzza watched carefully. If the Yankees won \xe2\x80\x94 as they did \xe2\x80\x94 and if the Baltimore Orioles lost to the Toronto Blue Jays, the Red Sox would not clinch the American League East title. Cucuzza and the maintenance crew would have had to tear down the work they had just completed in only a few minutes, before the losing players returned to the clubhouse.\xe2\x80\x9cI had my phone, and I was also watching the score in Toronto,\xe2\x80\x9d Cucuzza said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was close, but when I saw the Orioles scored in the ninth, I just said to leave it all up.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      When the Orioles won on Wednesday, the Red Sox clinched the division and were able to celebrate. Now it could be the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 turn, leaving Cucuzza and his crew to arrange and clean up a second celebration.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles, who lost to the Yankees, 7-3, on Saturday, could clinch a wild-card berth on Sunday, which would result in Yankee Stadium having hosted two Champagne-and-beer celebrations in less than a week, neither involving the Yankees themselves. Times have certainly changed.\xe2\x80\x9cIf you win, you\xe2\x80\x99ve earned that right,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Girardi, the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 manager, said with a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to celebrate, then don\xe2\x80\x99t let them beat you.\xe2\x80\x9dClubhouse celebrations have been a tradition in baseball dating at least to the 1950s. But with the advent of divisional play, and then of three divisions and two wild-card teams in recent years, the Champagne-infused fiestas have mushroomed.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  There are now five playoff teams in each league, so 10 teams can celebrate their entrance into the postseason. With each round of the playoffs (two wild-card games, two division series, two league championships and one World Series) factored in, baseball can have a total of 17 \xe2\x80\x9cChampagne fights,\xe2\x80\x9d as Japanese reporters like to call them.

Privacy Policy     The unsung heroes of all these celebrations are the clubhouse attendants, like Cucuzza, who are charged with preparing for and cleaning up long after the last drop of Champagne has been poured over the last man on the roster.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cWe finished cleaning up around 3:30 in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d Cucuzza said of Wednesday night\xe2\x80\x99s celebrations, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s faster than it used to be. But the kids did a tremendous job. The Red Sox players came in the next day and said they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it did not even smell.\xe2\x80\x9dThat was in part because of a celebration innovation that could become as common as protective eyewear. Like a sharp baseball scout, Cucuzza was watching the Chicago Cubs celebrate their division championship on television last month when he noticed plastic wrapping on the floor of the Cubs\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse, not just over the lockers.\xe2\x80\x9cI thought, \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s an idea,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Cucuzza said.So he and his staff did the same thing for the Red Sox\xe2\x80\x99 celebration Wednesday. When the party was over, Cucuzza and five members of his clubhouse staff gathered around sections of the plastic and lifted up the corners, creating a kiddie pool of the remnants of Champagne and beer. They carried it into a hamper and out to be drained. The process was repeated for the remaining sections of floor covering.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  When they were done, a cleaning crew shampooed the rug. In years past, when all the Champagne and beer spilled directly onto the carpet, the cleaning crew would have to come in two or three times to extract the liquid and shampoo the rug, and the smell would linger for days.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Red Sox celebrated their division title on Wednesday despite having lost on a game-ending grand slam by Mark Teixeira. If the Orioles had lost to the Blue Jays, Cucuzza and his staff would have quickly removed the carts full of Champagne and beer, as well as all that plastic. There would not have been time, however, to put all the furniture back in place.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tradition,\xe2\x80\x9d Red Sox Manager John Farrell said the day after the party. \xe2\x80\x9cLast night was surreal. It was odd. Do you celebrate after a loss? That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a fundamental question.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles knew on Saturday that they could face similar circumstances on Sunday. If the Tigers lose on Sunday, and the Seattle Mariners were also to lose one of their last two games, then the Orioles could clinch even if they lose to the Yankees on Sunday.Buck Showalter, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 manager, has refused even to discuss any advance scouting for the playoffs, let alone the idea of celebrating after a loss.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are trying to do something that makes us that team,\xe2\x80\x9d he said before Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s loss.But if the Orioles do end up partying at Yankee Stadium on Sunday, Cucuzza and his staff will be there to clean it up.

(AP Photo/Kathy Kmonicek)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORESo much for any Game No. 162 chaos in baseball: The San Francisco Giants, Toronto Blue Jays and Baltimore Orioles grabbed the last three playoff spots Sunday, and the October matchups are set.Neat and clean, no need for all sorts of tiebreakers. Too bad \xe2\x80\x94 that kind of final-day scramble might\'ve been fun for fans.Instead, they could sit back, savor Vin Scully\'s farewell call and prepare for the postseason. It opens Tuesday night when the Orioles visit Toronto in the AL wild-card game.""All we asked for is an opportunity, and right now, we have an opportunity,"" Baltimore center fielder Adam Jones said after a 5-2 win over the New York Yankees. ""So, let\'s celebrate and enjoy this and get back to work.""No official word yet on the starting pitchers at Rogers Centre. Figures to be Chris Tillman for the O\'s against Marcus Stroman.On Wednesday night, aces duel as Madison Bumgarner starts for the Giants vs. Noah Syndergaard and the New York Mets at Citi Field in the NL wild-card game.""We found a way to get back to where we need to be,"" Bumgarner said after his team\'s 7-1 win finished off a sweep of the Dodgers. ""If we play like we have been the last three days, we\'ll be tough to beat.""On Thursday, the best-of-five AL Division Series begins: David Ortiz and Boston at Cleveland, and the wild-card winner at Texas.""I guess I wish Ortiz would consider retiring early,"" said Indians manager Terry Francona, who previously guided Big Papi with the Red Sox, ""but I don\'t see that happening.""On Friday night, Clayton Kershaw starts Game 1 for the Los Angeles Dodgers at Washington, and the NL wild-card winner plays the best-in-the-majors Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.Going into Game 162, Detroit and St. Louis also had a chance to reach the postseason. That raised the possibility of multi-team, multi-city tiebreakers going into early next week.The Tigers were in the middle of that mix. They hoped to win at Atlanta and have either the Orioles or Blue Jays lose \xe2\x80\x94 then, they would\'ve needed to win a makeup game at home Monday against Cleveland to force a tiebreaker for an AL wild-card spot.""I would not have enjoyed the travel,"" Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said, ""but I would have relished traveling.""That kind of drama never developed as the teams holding leads took care of business.Manager Buck Showalter and Baltimore sealed their spot, winning at Yankee Stadium. When the Tigers later lost 1-0 at Atlanta in the last game at Turner Field, they were out and Toronto was back in for the second straight year.Later, the Blue Jays\' 2-1 victory at Fenway Park meant they would host Baltimore.With All-Star catcher Buster Posey getting three hits and driving in three runs, San Francisco beat the Dodgers and eliminated the Cardinals.The Giants have enjoyed a recent run of even-year success, winning the World Series in 2010, 2012 and 2014.The last time they reached the postseason, Bumgarner pitched a shutout at Pittsburgh in the wild-card game and went on to become the World Series MVP. So another cross-country flight to begin the playoffs was fine by them.""I don\'t think it bothers anybody that we go on the road to win these games. It\'s actually a lot of fun,"" first baseman Brandon Belt said. ""With Bumgarner on the mound, we\'re going to have a good shot.""___This story has been corrected to delete a reference to the Giants playing at Dodger Stadium \xe2\x80\x94 the game was in San Francisco \xe2\x80\x94 and to correct that the Tigers would\'ve faced the Indians on Monday in a makeup game to force a tiebreaker for an AL wild-card spot.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2016 The Associated Press.
