That is a fact, and anything else may be spin. But here goes.The first two games were tied in the ninth inning before Kansas City pulled ahead. The Orioles lost the next two games by scores of 2-1. The Royals deserved their A.L. pennant, but things could have easily broken Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s way. The Orioles should not be forgotten as a new season begins.It might be easy to overlook the Orioles, who lost three well-known players in the off-season without adding brand-name replacements. The longtime right fielder Nick Markakis signed with Atlanta, the home run champion Nelson Cruz signed with Seattle and the left-handed reliever Andrew Miller signed with the Yankees.But in their three seasons together, Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter have forged a winning formula. Duquette, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 executive vice president for baseball operations, finds useful roster pieces, and Showalter, the manager, expertly deploys them around center fielder Adam Jones, the team\xe2\x80\x99s cornerstone. Names like Steve Pearce, Alejandro De Aza and Delmon Young may not be easy to market, but with Baltimore, they win.

They will win again this season for the same reasons.               A.L. Predicted  ', 'www.nytimes.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Overall Team Preview and Predictions ...', 'Oct 3, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles left fielder Alejandro De Aza (12) stands in the outfield during game two of the 2014 ALDS playoff baseball game against the Detroit Tigers at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsHaving previously written the past two days about predictions, first for the Baltimore Orioles pitching staff and then for the position players, this third segment of preseason predictions will speak of the overall team and where we might find them at the end of the day on Sunday, October 4th.At that time, after a season-ending seven-game homestand \xe2\x80\x93 with four games against Toronto and the final three with the Yankees \xe2\x80\x93 they will have a 93-69 record and five-game divisional championship over the second-place Blue Jays. This will mean that they will be able to capture the AL East title at home at the beginning of that week against that nemesis from Canada \xe2\x80\x93 and there will be a sense of justice surrounding it, given all that happened over this past winter. Can somebody give me an \xe2\x80\x9camen?\xe2\x80\x9dThere is no doubt that the Orioles benefitted from a down year of baseball during 2014 in the perennially tough AL East. The Birds won by a large margin and were the best team in the division, even if the others did not have a plethora of injuries. And as we well know, the O\xe2\x80\x99s were not immune from such either.Benefitting from a career year by Nelson Cruz, a breakout season by Steve Pearce and solid play from a handful of others including veterans Adam Jones, Nick Markakis and J.J. Hardy, it was the pitching staff that really made the difference. The bullpen was among the better relief staffs in all of baseball, but it was the solid pitching of the starting rotation over the final four months that accounted for the largest difference.Since that entire starting staff is back, and only a two-month rental in the bullpen is missing, this foundation is more than adequate in my view to place the Baltimore Orioles as a definitive favorite in the AL East. Without doubt, the division has strengthened \xe2\x80\x93 especially the Blue Jays and Red Sox. Even so, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 position players look prepared for a sufficient support of the pitching staff to carry the team to a title, albeit a bit closer than last year.I will not attempt to identify the other playoff participants from the other five divisions. Seattle looks to be well-positioned, and most everyone likes the Washington Nationals to power their way to the World Series on the strength of their pitching staff. It could well happen.I will predict the Orioles to make it to the American League Championship Series, but to sadly lose again and fall short of the Fall Classic. If the playoff games were played on a nearly-daily basis as is the regular season, I would pick the O\xe2\x80\x99s and Buck Showalter to fully prevail. But with it stretched out and with multiple travel and off days in the playoffs, this gives an advantage to teams with superstar players over squads with well-rounded lineups. Buck agrees with this assessment.So here is my AL East prediction \xe2\x80\xa6Baltimore \xe2\x80\x93 93-69Toronto \xe2\x80\x93 88-74Boston \xe2\x80\x93 85-77New York \xe2\x80\x93 80-82Tampa Bay \xe2\x80\x93 70-92How have I done with predictions in other years?\xc2\xa0 Well, I picked the O\xe2\x80\x99s to have 92 wins in 2014; and we know that they totaled 96. However, I did have them losing to the Rays by three games; and of course, the Rays had tons of injuries and fell apart. The Orioles did a little worse than what I thought in 2013, and just a bit better than my prediction in 2012. I did think that they would do very well in that breakout year, but did not expect they\xe2\x80\x99d actually make the playoffs. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen workWe\xe2\x80\x99ve all heard a lot about how many baseball pundits have the Orioles predicted for a very mediocre season. The recent winning tradition of three years is simply not long enough to shake off the prior losing tradition. A common story is to think that there is insufficient replacement of Cruz and Markakis for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to repeat \xe2\x80\x93 a story espoused even by some Baltimore fans. I have written ad nauseam about how I believe that is a fully wrong-headed analysis.Here are some predictions for the AL East by other baseball writers (and I\xe2\x80\x99ll add a few more in articles in coming days \xe2\x80\xa6 also keeping all of these to either gloat over or mock in October!).Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with mlb.com columnist Richard Justice. Last year, he too had the Rays on top with the Orioles and Red Sox as challengers. Last week he wrote in a great column\xe2\x80\xa6Let\xe2\x80\x99s get out in front of this thing here and now. The Baltimore Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t sneaking up on anyone this time. Fooled me once\xe2\x80\xa6 Are they going to win the American League East for the second year in a row? They just might. In fact, they probably deserve to be the favorite.It is always good to see converts to wisdom and justice \xe2\x80\xa6 kinda like his name.Actually there is some love for the Baltimore Orioles from the CBSSports.com staff of Jon Heyman, Mike Axisa, David Brown, Dayn Perry and Matt Snyder. Two of them have the Orioles winning, two choose the O\xe2\x80\x99s for second place, and one places them third.Amazingly, 10 out of 15 baseball experts at ESPN have the Orioles winning the AL East, with four choosing the Jays and one taking the Red Sox. But only one of the 10 who picked Baltimore sees them in the World Series, and that would be Jayson Stark; but he predicts them to lose to the Nationals.Like many of the major sports sites, when talking about the AL East, the USA TODAY gang speaks of it as throwing a dart at a board in order to choose a winner. Others sites call it a horse race with no clear favorite. But the power rankings at USA TODAY go with the Red Sox first, Jays second, Orioles third, Rays fourth, and some other team you\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of in the basement.There is not a lot of love at Yahoo.com Sports for the Baltimore Orioles. In what they call a \xe2\x80\x9cwide-open division,\xe2\x80\x9d two of three writers take the Red Sox, while another picks the Blue Jays. Two have the Orioles finishing third, and one places them fourth. The guy placing them fourth \xe2\x80\x93 Mark Townsend \xe2\x80\x93 calls for Adam Jones to be the top hitter in the AL East. I love Adam, but I\xe2\x80\x99d never write something like that!Writing and predicting crazy things before a 162-game season begins is what makes baseball such a great sport. Nobody ever gets it completely right; there are always unanticipated storylines that make for great interest and pundit upsets. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

The Orioles home opener is this Friday. Jessica Kartalija explains that means big business, not only for Baltimore, but the entire state! Area businesses can\xe2\x80\x99t wait until the birds are back. They are gearing up for the start of the season rush and hoping the O\xe2\x80\x99s play as well as they did last season. When you clinch the AL East, then go on to the American League Championship Series, there\xe2\x80\x99s high hopes for the season ahead. At the Inner Harbor, bars, restaurants and hotels can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for Opening Day. They\xe2\x80\x99re hoping that another winning season will continue to further boost their bottom line. \xe2\x80\x9cLots of orange and black in town, and that makes us happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Meghan Walsh, with the Hard Rock Cafe. The Hard Rock at the harbor has become a pre- and post-game hotspot. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got our deck open, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got happy hour going, live music. So we are ready to go,\xe2\x80\x9d Walsh said. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the hotels in downtown are checked out, all the hotels in Harbor East are checked out, restaurants are full, bars are full, shopping takes place,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom Noonan, CEO of Visit Baltimore, said. Noonan says Orioles baseball is a great play for all of Maryland. \xe2\x80\x9cIt impacts the region, it impacts out by the airport, even the Eastern Shore. So, it has a huge economic engine for not even just the city of Baltimore, but for the entire region,\xe2\x80\x9d Noonan said. Orange crush specials in the bar, while upstairs, rooms at the Four Seasons are booking up fast for Opening Day. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of travelers that come from D.C. and Virginia to stay and spend the weekend with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julien Carralero, general manager of the Four Seasons. First pitch marks the start of Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s tourism season. Kartalija: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have Opening Day, followed by Preakness. What does this do for the hotel\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line?\xe2\x80\x9d Carralero: \xe2\x80\x9cFirst quarter is always a little bit tough because of the winter season. But for us, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly very beneficial.\xe2\x80\x9d For all of us,here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping the Orioles have another winning season. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great when the Orioles do well, because we do well,\xe2\x80\x9d Walsh said.

04/07/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Power and pitching rule on Tillman Island', 'From game 1 to game 162, baseball begins and ends with starting pitching. The good news for the Baltimore Orioles is that their ace, Chris Tillman, answered the call yesterday as the O\xe2\x80\x99s defeated Tampa 6-2 on Opening Day. It can be hard pitching the opener given the pressure to start fast out of the gate. In last year\xe2\x80\x99s opener Tillman struggled a bit with command and nerves, although the Orioles managed to win. But as he told Roch Kubatko of MASNsports after the game, this year was different:It was much easier today. You\xe2\x80\x99re always going to have the nerves on opening day, but it was nothing like last year. I was able to keep it under control, starting in the bullpen and coming into the game. I was happy with it.Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.2 I, 4 H, 1 R, 3 BB, 4 K. The O\xe2\x80\x99s jumped on top early by playing the role of opportunists. Alejandro De Aza hit a dribbler up the first base line out of the lead off spot \xe2\x80\x93 a ball that appeared destined to be an out. However Tampa pitcher Chris Archer threw the ball high to first and into right field, allowing De Aza to reach on an error. A walk, a sac fly (to move De Aza to third), and a Travis Snider RBI-single later, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had an early 1-0 lead in the first inning on Opening Day.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal2/17 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Johnson wants to revitalize his careerCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThat was obviously an unearned run, however in the fifth inning De Aza would tack on one that was earned, by way of a two-run homer. An inning later Steve Pearcee would add a solo shot of his own, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a 4-0 lead as we went into the later innings. However not to be outdone, Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s Evan Longoria got his team on the board with a solo homer in the seventh, cutting the lead to 4-1.In the eighth Snider, who had one heck of a first game with the Orioles, smacked a double to right field. Steve Pearce came around third to score, however he appeared to be dead in the water at home plate. However Tampa right fielder Steven Souza\xe2\x80\x99s throw was a bit high, and Pearce had the foresight to slide. Speaking for myself, it caught me off guard at first. Rivera, the Tampa catcher, was literally waiting at home plate with the ball well before Pearce arrived. If anything, it would have made more sense for Pearce to just accept a token soft tag and walk back to the dugout, right?Probably. However as I said, the throw was high. Pearce attempted to slide under the tag, and at first it appeared that he was unsuccessful because he was called out. Buck Showalter challeneged the play from the dugout, and in fact replays were fairly conclusive to the effect that Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s foot had crossed home plate prior to the tag. The call was reversed and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a 5-1 lead.Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s Astrubal Cabrera would add an RBI-double in the eighth, however Ryan Flaherty would insert his name into the homer parade with a solo shot of his own in the ninth inning to close out the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 6-2 victory on Opening Day. It got a little hairy in the last of the eighth when Tommy Hunter allowed the aforementioned RBI-double, as that gave Tampa two runners in scoring position. However Hunter induced a pop up with two outs by Longoria, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s ended the threat. Zach Britton also retired Tampa 1-2-3 in the ninth \xe2\x80\x93 in a non-save situation.The Orioles got some great efforts yesterday out of guys who were in theory replacing departed players. De Aza, Pearce, and Flaherty all homered, and Snider was responsible for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first run of the game and of the season with an RBI-single. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the type of production that the Orioles are going to need up and down the lineup in order to repeat as AL East champions.Snider also showed us that he can be an asset in right field, gunning down a would-be run at home plate in the fifth. With two outs, James Loney tried to score from second on Logan Forsythe\xe2\x80\x99s single to right field. However Snider came up throwing, and with ice water in his veins relayed the ball to catcher Caleb Joseph and gunned down Loney.Incidentally, Tampa challenged the play under the premise that Joseph blocked the plate before the ball arrived. However the umpires upheld the call, as replays showed that there was in fact a clear path to the plate for the runner. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re keeping score at home, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are 1-0 in challenges this year, and opponents are 0-1. Last season you might remember that the Orioles had a long drought on challenges early in the season \xe2\x80\x93 for whatever any of that is worth.Again, this is only game 1 out of 162 \xe2\x80\x93 but it\xe2\x80\x99s always nice to get off to a good start. The Orioles will make a roster move prior to game two this evening, as Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 suspension is officially now complete. While nothing is set in stone until it\xe2\x80\x99s done, word on the street is that Steve Clevenger will be optioned to Norfolk to make room for Davis on the roster. If you think about it, the timing really worked out great for the Orioles. As opposed to returning in the post season last year after having sat for a month-and-a-half, Davis now returns after sitting one game\xe2\x80\xa6but in the wake of spring training. He should be ready to rock.The Orioles and Tampa will continue their series this evening as Wei-Yin Chen heads to the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s in game two. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Nathan Karns, with game time set for just after 7 PM.Next: Baltimore Orioles: AL East predictions  ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

He was on the verge of quitting baseball only to become the MLB leader in throwing out base runners. Joseph was 23-for-47 throwing out base stealers. His 40 percent rate was astonishing considering the league average was 27 percent. That\xe2\x80\x99s where Clevenger struggled. He was just 3-for-20 against base stealers.Last season, he won the backup catcher job, but did very little to impress in his stint in the Majors. The pride of Pigtown batted just .243 through his first 24 games with the Orioles, but more importantly, the team was just 8-10 in games that he called. After the Orioles traded for Nick Hundley, Clevenger was sent to the minors. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t happy about the move then either.Eduardo Encina of The Baltimore Sun wrote a piece last month about Clevenger\xe2\x80\x99s journey in the 2014.

I thought I deserved to stay in the big leagues for what I did in spring training. I thought I deserved a better shot at staying with the team. I did go down with a chip on my shoulder, and I did tell myself I was going to prove these guys wrong. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I took it all going down to Norfolk. I was really frustrated down there.\xe2\x80\x9dThis openness of his frustration is not going to make anything any easier for him. We all can understand that he wants to play at the highest level.

The fans want that if it is going to help the team.Clevenger should realize that even after being sent down, he is still viewed as a solid option in this organization. He has made the Opening Day roster the past two seasons. Both Joseph\xc2\xa0and Matt Wieters can not make that same claim.This is not the time for him to sulk. He is another injury away from being back in the Majors.\xc2\xa0Continue to work hard and get back to Baltimore.

Mandatory Credit: Denny Medley-USA TODAY SportsFor the second consecutive day, the Baltimore Orioles scored six runs in a ballgame. And for the second time, it was enough to win; but six runs should always be enough to win any baseball game.After opening to a 6-0 lead in the first two at-bats, the O\xe2\x80\x99s only managed to get only one more hit the rest of the game, yet they were able to hold on for a 6-5 victory.\xe2\x80\x9cHolding on\xe2\x80\x9d is exactly what it felt like for the final seven innings. In the post-game interview, Showalter said it felt like the root canal surgery he had suffered in the offseason. Good description. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 four pitchers threw a grand total of 176 pitches in the game. The Rays \xe2\x80\x93 no offensive juggernaut \xe2\x80\x93 fouled off pitch after pitch like the Yankees or Red Sox in their prime years.Wei-Yin Chen was simply not sharp. As in 2014 where he was the recipient of the fourth-best run support in the AL, the O\xe2\x80\x99s began the game with four consecutive hits \xe2\x80\x93 plating four runs in the first inning and two in the second. But after a seven-pitch first inning, Chen could not command many of his pitches. He struggled to get any feel or consistency. The velocity was unimpressive. He added to his own troubles by forgetting how many outs there were in one inning and throwing to the wrong base. It was not a good performance.

He did this only 11 times for the entire season of 2014.Even though the Orioles pitchers managed to tally 11 strikeouts, they often appeared to be without any sort of put-away pitch (other than Britton). Of course, the strike zone was completely different and much smaller than it was on Monday.Though Kevin Gausman registered four strikeouts in 2.1 innings, while also hitting 100 mph on several pitches, he did not look to have very good command.Other high points \xe2\x80\xa6Jones squared up his first hit of the year by driving a double into left-center field and bringing in two runs in the first inning, as the Orioles bunched four of their six hits.Travis Snider drove in another run in this first at-bat, and then walked three times. He has patience at the plate, and this was true of this prior record as well.Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s second home run in two days proved to be the margin of victory. He looks to be seeing the ball well. When he is hot, a team can ride on him.Though Zach Britton ran full counts to all three batters in the bottom of the ninth inning, he did strike them all out. And over two games he has five strikeouts in two innings. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that Showalter will bring him back for a third straight game, so maybe we will be Brian Matusz and Jason Garcia today.The best high point is that the Orioles are 2-0 with a chance to sweep the opening series.

Pearce, who never had more than 165 at-bats in a season before he had 338 in 2014, led the team in on-base percentage (.373), slugging (.556) and OPS (.930). His value, though, extends beyond the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box. He can play either corner outfield position, first base and also sees time at designated hitter. Pearce was at first in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s season opener with Chris Davis serving the final game of a 25-game suspension for a positive amphetamine test and homered and scored twice in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 6-2 victory. Davis returned as the DH Tuesday and Pearce made another start at first, going 2 for 4 with a two-run homer and two runs as the Orioles held on for a 6-5 win. \xe2\x80\x9cWe struck early,\xe2\x80\x9d Pearce told MLB\xe2\x80\x99s official website. \xe2\x80\x9cWe put some runs on the board. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we did that because we came to a halt. And they made a great comeback and it\xe2\x80\x99s just another typical O\xe2\x80\x99s-Rays game.\xe2\x80\x9d Pearce, from nearby Lakeland, is 14 for 35 (.400) with five homers, three doubles and nine RBIs in last 11 games at Tropicana Field. He has hit eight of his 40 career homers against the Rays (0-2). Manager Buck Showalter said Davis, who went 0 for 3 in his debut, will play first in the series finale, meaning Pearce could serve as DH. Travis Snider is also being counted on to help fill the void created by the offseason departures of Nelson Cruz and Nick Markakis, and so far, he\xe2\x80\x99s been more than up to the task. Snider has reached base in all but one of his eight plate appearances. He was 3 for 4 with two RBIs in the opener, and singled home a run in a four-run first inning Tuesday before walking in his final three at-bats. The Orioles are in position to sweep a season-opening series at Tampa Bay, matching their accomplishment in 2011. Miguel Gonzalez (10-9, 3.23 ERA) looks to pitch Baltimore to its ninth win in 12 games at Tropicana Field, where he is 3-1 with a 2.64 ERA in five starts. The right-hander won both of his decisions in three overall starts against the Rays in 2014 but allowed 19 hits \xe2\x80\x93 including four homers \xe2\x80\x93 and nine walks in 14 2-3 innings. The Rays, who haven\xe2\x80\x99t opened 0-3 since that sweep to Baltimore, got home runs from Kevin Kiermaier and Logan Forsythe on Tuesday. Four of Kiermaier\xe2\x80\x99s 11 career home runs have come in this matchup. Jake Odorizzi (11-13, 4.13) will try to reverse his fortunes against the Orioles. In four career starts versus Baltimore \xe2\x80\x93 all last season \xe2\x80\x93 the right-hander has posted a 6.52 ERA. He only allowed six runs over 15 1-3 innings in the first three meetings but a 9-1 loss at Camden Yards on Aug. 25 caused his ERA to balloon. The right-hander surrendered four homers in that contest, yielding eight runs and 11 hits over four innings. This is a very favorable matchup for Adam Jones, who went 8 for 12 with a home run against Odorizzi last season. Pearce, Alejandro De Aza and Delmon Young also took him deep.  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com')]"

Despite the defeat, the Birds did win their opening series of the 2015 baseball season two games to one. Of course, Baltimore manager Buck Showalter will take a series victory in a heartbeat.  Tampa Bay RHP Jake Odorizzi held the Orioles to only two hits in 6.2 IP to pick up the first career win for Rays manager Kevin Cash. Odorizzi struck out seven and walked none as the Rays avoided the sweep.  Following the second inning of the Orioles 6-5 triumph on Tuesday night, Tampa Bay pitchers put the Baltimore bats on ice. The Birds were shutout for the final 16 innings of the series and went five for their last 55 at the plate. They struck out 13 times in the series finale and a total of 29 times over the course of three games.  As for the starting pitching, the Orioles got a solid performance from RHP Chris Tillman on Opening Day. In the next two games, Showalter got subpar outings from LHP Wei-Yin Chen and RHP Miguel Gonzalez. No need to start pushing panic buttons, however. Both will be fine in the long run.  Defensively, the Orioles did their thing as they went unscathed over the course of the series. As usual, they will be one of the best teams in all of the majors in that area.  The Baltimore home opener at Camden Yards is Friday afternoon against the Toronto Blue Jays.  RHP Bud Norris is scheduled to take the mound for the Orioles against veteran Toronto lefty Mark Buehrle. Norris was 4-0 and posted a 1.78 ERA against the Blue Jays in 2014. Baseball season has been begun and the Orioles are coming home.

The suspension ended after the Orioles opened the season on the road Monday against Tampa Bay, so Davis will have already played in two games when he starts at first base on Friday against Toronto.""At the end of the season last year I looked to see where we started,"" Davis said Thursday. ""I didn\'t want to miss the opening day at home, so I was relieved to find out we started in Tampa.""Davis could only imagine how he will feel during pregame introductions while running on the orange carpet from the bullpen to the infield.""I think I was a little emotional just getting on the plane last night,"" he said. ""I hope I can hold it together. I feel like I have this image of myself as a tough guy, so it would look pretty bad if the starting first baseman runs down there crying and blubbering like a baby.""Davis last played at Camden Yards on Sept. 10, the final day before his suspension started. The Orioles went on to clinch the AL East without him, then beat Detroit in the postseason before being swept by Kansas City in the AL Championship Series.A sellout crowd \xe2\x80\x94 and rain \xe2\x80\x94 is expected for the team\'s 2015 home debut.

It\'s been a while.""The Blue Jays, meanwhile, opened the season with three games at Yankee Stadium and have to endure three more games in Baltimore before opening their home schedule on Monday.""It\'s tough, but we\'re looking to get off to a good start,"" Toronto manager John Gibbons said in the visitor\'s clubhouse at Yankee Stadium. ""We had a good spring. We\'re confident. But it\'s never easy opening up in those places, especially here and then Baltimore\'s going to be a tough place to play. They\'ve got a good team. So it would definitely be helpful to get off to a good start.""Mark Buehrle will start for the Blue Jays. Although the left-hander owns a decent 3.57 lifetime ERA against Baltimore, he knows this won\'t just be another game.""There\'s obviously the atmosphere, and it\'s a buildup,"" Buehrle said. ""If you let the crowd get you pumped up, or worry about the crowd or get amped up, then you\'re not going to be yourself and you\'re not going to do a good job.""Coming off his finest year in the majors, Bud Norris will pitch for the Orioles.

The Rays won 2-0. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThe regular baseball season is underway! The Baltimore Orioles will be home on Friday for their season opener. There is no bad news that is bigger than this good news. Now, if we can just get some cooperative weather in Maryland, that would be awesome.So what can we take away from the opening series against the Tampa Bay Rays, beyond the fact that the Orioles are 2-1? And though we may have wished for a sweep, we all know that winning two out of three games over the course of a season is more than enough to end up with the best record in MLB.As always with the Orioles (and I suppose this is true of most teams at most times), it is a mixed bag of results and trends. But here are five takeaways that are going through my mind right now \xe2\x80\xa6The Baltimore Orioles can be a very explosive team.On several occasions over the first two games we saw the O\xe2\x80\x99s going on an offensive feeding frenzy. Three home runs in game one remind of the firepower on this team. Beginning the second game with four consecutive hits and situational hitting to bring them all home; this is the stuff of winners. There is definitely more speed on this Orioles squad than we have seen in a while. The Birds are indeed a team that can score runs in bunches and in a short time.The Baltimore Orioles can go into extended hitting funks and be shut down by good pitching.Just about the time you start to get excited with the Orioles getting on base and scoring runs (like 12 of them in 11 innings), they go into an offensive funk and pass through 16 innings with zero runs and only four hits. They also strike out 13 times in one game. Over the series, the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 batting average was .185, so it really is pretty awesome that they were able to win two-of-three ballgames. Even with some exciting moments from Alejandro De Aza, it is not encouraging that the leadoff hitter is already leading the team in strikeouts (though my money is still on Chris Davis to do that in the end).The talent is on this O\xe2\x80\x99s team to sufficiently replace the Losses of Cruz and Markakis.The first game of the year was such an interesting and affirming exhibit that the combination of De Aza, Steve Pearce, and Travis Snider can make some things happen. In total, they are not going to even be a downgrade in the field. And when it is all said and done, I am going to guess that the total number of home runs from outfielders and designated hitters in 2015 may not lag honestly that much behind the stats from the same positional personnel last year. At the same time, I will bet that the batting average is actually higher and offsets the power losses. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see; the talent is there.For championship success, the Orioles are going to need a strong majority of players performing at the top ends of their historic performances.That last sentence is just about the least analytical piece of mere common sense as I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever written. This is true of any team at any time. The Orioles had this happen in 2014, especially with pitchers. The Red Sox had it occur in 2013.So far we have seen Chris Tillman and Zach Britton clearly display this. We could say the same for Sinder, De Aza and Pearce. However, the majority of the others are looking to still have some rust to shake off. How well they do that, and do it fairly quickly, will determine the team level of success for this year.

Apart from those who have permanent homes in or near Sarasota, it is extended hotel life. Ever have the experience of looking forward to a vacation, but then after a while looking forward to getting back to your own home and bed?Spring training can become a tedious experience. The pitchers certainly need the length of it in order to be ready for the stresses of the season. The hitters?\xe2\x80\xa6 not so much. The journalists covering it also find it to be very, very long (not that I don\xe2\x80\x99t still envy that particular piece of suffering).So it is sort of insult to injury to add the first series of the season against a team just an hour north of one\xe2\x80\x99s own training facilities. After the second inning of the second game, the Orioles REALLY look like a team that needs a change of pace and scenery.Final thought \xe2\x80\x93 All of this is to say that, at this point, I do have some conflicted feelings about where this season could go. I still think the chances are better than average that it is another successful campaign at the top of the AL East. But this team is not free of warts and cracks\xe2\x80\xa6 though what team really is? And that\xe2\x80\x99s why they play the game.

It wasn\'t exactly what the sellout crowd of 45,936 was looking for in Baltimore\'s first home game since facing Kansas City in the AL Championship Series last October.""You always want to win the home opener. You have a good crowd, everybody\'s going to be fired up,"" first baseman Chris Davis said. ""To not just lose, but to get beat up, it\'s tough.""Adam Jones homered, had a career-high tying four hits and drove in two runs for the Orioles, now 41-21 in home openers since coming to Baltimore from St. Louis in 1954.Norris (0-1) allowed eight runs and seven hits in three-plus innings. He was 4-0 lifetime against Toronto and had won nine straight decisions against AL East foes.""Frustrating. It\'s not what I envisioned,"" Norris said. ""It\'s tough to do that here at home and in front of my team. I\'ll take that one on me, for sure.""Jose Bautista ended an early-season slump by going 3 for 3 and scoring four runs, and Josh Donaldson and Dioner Navarro each drove in three runs for the Blue Jays.Mark Buehrle (1-0) allowed one run and eight hits in six innings to earn his 200th career win.""It\'s going to mean more when I get home, retired and sit on the couch and look back,"" Buehrle said. ""It\'s a round number. Obviously been around a while, stayed healthy, made some starts.""After playing the spoiler\'s role at Yankee Stadium for New York\'s home opener Monday, the Blue Jays pulled off an encore at Camden Yards.Baltimore, meanwhile, came home after winning two of three on the road against Tampa Bay.Before the game, highlights of last season were shown on the video board. The Orioles were introduced one-by-one as they ran on an orange carpet from the bullpen area to the infield, and later Jones and shortstop J.J. Hardy received their Gold Glove Awards. Reaching back further in time, Palmer threw out the ceremonial first pitch to 1983 World Series MVP Rick Dempsey.Under an overcast sky and with rain in the forecast, Norris began the game with a first-pitch strike that drew a huge cheer. Not long after that, Toronto sucked much of the enthusiasm from the orange-and-black clad fans.The first-inning uprising began with three straight hits, including an RBI single by Bautista. Edwin Encarnacion added a sacrifice fly and Navarro doubled in two runs.Jones connected in the bottom half to make it 4-1, but in the third Bautista doubled and scored on a fly ball.Toronto batted around in a five-run fourth. Dalton Pompey and Donaldson each hit two-run doubles and Bautista singled in a run.DOUBLE FIGURESBlue Jays: The eight doubles was Toronto\'s most since July 20, 2010, at Kansas City.Orioles: It was the third time in club history that Orioles allowed at least 10 runs in a home opener.

Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY SportsOver the years of Buck Showalter managing the Baltimore Orioles, there have been more than one or two players who have said that their manager seems to so often know what is going to happen before it happens. There is no doubt that he has a keen eye for the game of baseball. Having been around it for so long and seen so much, he is able to pick up on subtle trends that are either positive or negative and essentially have a premonition about what might well transpire next. And then it does!Sometimes Buck even backs into a prophetic utterance. Before the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 opening game yesterday he was worrying about the weather and its effect upon game, particularly the starting pitcher. The worst-case scenario would be to play an inning and then have a 90-minute rain delay that knocks the starter out after throwing maybe only 15 pitches.But it even caught my ear and unsettled me just a bit when, before the game, Showalter innocently said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to try to at least start when there\xe2\x80\x99s a window to get the starting pitcher. Of course, the other team might not let him get through the first inning anyway. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it works.\xe2\x80\x9dNO! Don\xe2\x80\x99t say something like that. Four runs in the first inning off Bud Norris would follow, with eight runs charged over three innings. Final score, 12-5, and a rough day for the home opener.But it gets worse. After the game the prophet said of the Blue Jays,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re as athletically talented as you\xe2\x80\x99ll see in the major leagues. Quality arms, too. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a lot of fun this summer.\xe2\x80\x9dOh man! Did not need to hear that! But, it really is no secret that the Jays are likely to be the team to have to beat in the AL East this year.It is hard to believe that we find ourselves looking forward to Ubaldo Jimenez facing the Jays with his nasty stuff on Saturday. Hopefully he packed the command that he found in his final spring outings and has brought it along from Florida. Norris simply did not have command, and without that, most days are going to be difficult for any pitcher in the big leagues.Is there reason to worry about Norris? I have to say that I do think so. Something has been clearly missing this entire spring. Of this subject Buck said, \xe2\x80\x9cBud pitched well. You don\xe2\x80\x99t win the games he\xe2\x80\x99s won or done the things he\xe2\x80\x99s done in the big leagues without handling some different situations along the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Yes, 2014 was a great year, and there is reason to hope he will yet regain that form. Yet at the same time, last year was the only season in his career where the numbers and performance were in the top half of rotation starters. Remember that just a year ago it was very uncertain that Norris would even have a spot in the rotation.How about some of the other Orioles players who are scuffling at bit here at the beginning? How about Manny Machado? Reason to worry?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. He has a couple of times in his career already had some slow starts before putting it together consistently.How about Brad Brach with his 12.00 ERA at the moment? I think he will be fine. His velocity and movement seem sufficient to recover his 2014 form.

You can\'t do anything with the past.""Jimenez got nine straight outs before Jose Reyes hit a sinking liner to left that a diving De Aza barely missed grabbing. Jimenez then retired eight in a row \xe2\x80\x94 not allowing a ball out of the infield \xe2\x80\x94 before walking Reyes in the sixth.""Tonight was a good reminder why he\'s been a good quality major league starter for a long time,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""If you\'ve got any type of heart or feelings at all you know how much it means for him to contribute.""After Tommy Hunter worked a hitless eighth, Zach Britton gave up a double to Steve Tolleson and an RBI single to Edwin Encarnacion in the ninth.Aaron Sanchez (0-1) allowed three runs and seven hits over 3 1-3 innings for the Blue Jays in his first major league start. He surrendered two homers, twice as many as he yielded last season in 24 games as a reliever.""Obviously, this isn\'t the way I want to start the season,"" Sanchez said. ""I got out there and tried to slow things down too much. I started aiming a little bit. It was not the night I wanted.""On Friday, the Blue Jays scored four first-inning runs and rolled to an easy victory. In this one, the Orioles wasted no time taking control. De Aza marked his 31st birthday by driving Sanchez\'s second pitch over the right-field wall, and Davis hit an opposite-field shot to left with one out for a 2-0 lead.It was the first homer of the year for Davis, who hit 53 two years ago and 26 last season through Sept. 10 before a 25-game suspension for using Adderall.The only home run Sanchez allowed last year was to Davis on Aug. 5.Baltimore used three singles and a double-play grounder by Adam Jones to make it 3-0 in the third.That was more than enough offense for Jimenez.""He was just throwing strikes,"" Toronto manager John Gibbons said. ""I think that\'s the best we\'ve seen him since he came over here.""The Orioles pulled away in the fifth against Todd Remond. A single and two walks loaded the bases for Schoop, who hit a 1-1 pitch into the left-field seats for his first career grand slam.CLUBHOUSE TVBlue Jays: While some of the players were watching the end of the Yankees-Red Sox game, Dioner Navarro and Jose Bautista were glued to the Barcelona-Sevilla Spanish league soccer game on an iPad.

His is not the sort of demeanor that can endear players to fans at Yankee Stadium when their performances do not.And so it was during the off-season that a punching bag was set up in the Bronx when the Yankees re-signed Drew to a one-year, $5 million contract after he had done so little to earn it last season, his .162 batting average with the Red Sox and then the Yankees being the third-worst mark over the last century for players with 300 plate appearances.If there is to be a change of heart in how Yankees fans view Drew, the shift no doubt began here Monday night when he came off the bench to deliver a pinch-hit grand slam that lifted the Yankees to a 6-5 victory over Baltimore.It was an invigorating victory after a disappointing start to the season at home, and not a bad way for the team to embark on a stretch in which it will play 25 of 35 games on the road.

X-rays taken after he was removed showed no serious injuries. \xe2\x80\x9cI came to Joe before the seventh inning and I just let him know if my spot came up with guys on base, I might not be the best guy to go up there and swing the bat and try to drive them in. It turns out Stephen Drew was the man for the job.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  If Drew\xe2\x80\x99s home run Monday was a bolt from nowhere, the rally was constructed on innocuous building blocks: a bloop single from Chris Young, a walk by Murphy and a two-out dribbler that Jacoby Ellsbury beat out to load the bases.At the time, the Yankees were trailing by 4-2 after Orioles center fielder Adam Jones snapped a tie with a two-run homer to center field off Michael Pineda with two outs in the sixth. After Drew\xe2\x80\x99s homer, the Orioles closed the gap to 6-5 in the seventh when the Yankees could not turn a challenging 4-6-3 double play, allowing Manny Machado to score. A walk to Steve Pearce loaded the bases, but Dellin Betances struck out Chris Davis with a slider, allowing the Yankees to escape with their lead intact.Shortly after Murphy threw out Jones trying to steal second, Miller entered with one out in the eighth and closed out the victory. The last out came, fittingly enough, when Pearce bounced out to Drew at second.

He missed the first two months of last season after declining a one-year, $14 million qualifying offer from the Red Sox, eventually signing with them in May. Even though he was in good shape physically, he did not see live pitching for so long that he was far behind. His timing never recovered and neither did his confidence.

The fans expect a lot, and I understand why. We\xe2\x80\x99ve all been through it.\xe2\x80\x9dOne reason he chose to return was a desire to prove that he was still the hitter he was in 2013, when he delivered 29 doubles, 13 home runs and 67 runs batted in for the Red Sox, who won the World Series.\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to be here,\xe2\x80\x9d Drew said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what kind of team this is.

And the O\xe2\x80\x99s got that quality start out of Chen, who pitched six strong innings. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 1 BB, 4 K. In effect, Chen made two bad pitches in the game \xe2\x80\x93 which I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to in a moment. But his fastball had polish, and he mixed his pitches well, leaving the game with a two-run lead.Last night was the first meeting of 2015 between these two AL East rivals, and also the first trip out of New York for Alex Rodriguez. And as expected, he heard if from the Camden faithful. But that bears no relevance to the game itself \xe2\x80\x93 per se. However ARod couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have expected to have been received particularly well in terms of being in a visiting ballpark.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

However the O\xe2\x80\x99s came back to tie the game in the last of the inning on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double. Jonathan Schoop would then hit an apparent RBI-single to give the Orioles a 2-1, however Buck Showalter challeneged the play at second base where Schoop was thrown out advancing. That challenge was upheld, and Schoop was credited with an RBI-double.As I said, Chen made two bad pitches \xe2\x80\x93 the second of those was in the fourth inning on a pitch that resulted in a Mark Texeira home run ball to tie the game at two. However as is usually the case, the O\xe2\x80\x99s battled back. New York starter Michael Pineda was also capable of making a bad pitch. And that he certainly did, as Adam Jones got a hold of a pitch with a runner on and smacked it over the centerfield wall to give the Birds a 4-2 lead.Buck Showalter opted to lift Chen after the O\xe2\x80\x99s took the lead, bringing Tommy Hunter in from the bullpen. Hunter allowed two runners on, and then walked Jacobdy Ellsbury. He then proceeded to throw a bad pitch of his own, which unfortunately came with two outs and the bases loaded. And that pitch landed in the stands in right center field, off the bat of pinch hitter Stephen Drew.That grand slam gave New York a 6-4 lead in the seventh. Drew pinch hit to begin with because Brett Gardener injured his wrist, and had to leave the game. Hunter was visibly angry at himself on the mound and after going back to the dugout. But that\xe2\x80\x99s how this game works out sometimes, and you always have to take the good with the bad.But the O\xe2\x80\x99s weren\xe2\x80\x99t out of it quite yet. They loaded the bases with one down in the seventh, and Alejandro De Aza gorunded into what could have been a double-play. However Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s takeout slide at second delayed the relay just enough for De Aza to reach safely, scoring a fifth run for the Birds.There was still time in the game, however New York turned one of the Orioles biggest bullpen weapons in 2014 against them in Andrew Miller. In pitching his third career save, Miller retired the final five hitters of the game to secure the victory for New York.Courtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsMake no mistake about the fact that the O\xe2\x80\x99s shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have lost this game. Furthermore, in struggling a bit in these early season games, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are also wasting Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 strong start at the plate. Jones of course hit his third homer last night, and he\xe2\x80\x99s batting .440 on the very young season. However it\xe2\x80\x99s also worth mentioning that they started 1-4 last year. Obviously they got it together. And at some point, they\xe2\x80\x99ll probably win a game or two that they otherwise shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have won.The series with New York continues tonight with Miguel Gonzalez on the mound for the Orioles.

(WJZ) \xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore Orioles outfielder Nolan Reimold slapped Johns Hopkins Hospital with a multi-million dollar lawsuit.   Derek Valcourt has details on how Reimold says the hospital hurt him. This all centers on a surgery Reimold had in 2012.  He says doctors let him back in the game too soon. Nolan Reimold was a rising star in 2009 but physical injuries started taking a toll and in June of 2012, doctors at Johns Hopkins ordered surgery to fuse two of his neck bones together, causing Reimold to miss the rest of the season. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing.  I wanted to not just individually but collectively too, because the team has been playing well,\xe2\x80\x9d Reimold said at the time. About seven months after the surgery, doctors cleared him to return to baseball\xe2\x80\x94but this lawsuit filed by Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys claims Hopkins and the doctor negligently misinterpreted that Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s neck bones had fused together when they had not.   After a brief return to the Orioles, he was forced to leave again for a second surgery. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a collosal mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said his attorney Hassan Murphy. Attorney Hassan Murphy says the doctor erred in releasing Reimold to play in spite in contrary X-rays.  A second surgery was successful and Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s now back with the O\xe2\x80\x99s, although for now not on the major league roster.  His lawyers say the doctor and Hopkins should be held responsible for the time he missed on the field in the prime of his life. \xe2\x80\x9cNolan has played for two years with minor league contacts, which would have never been the case had his career not been derailed the way it had been,\xe2\x80\x9d Murphy said. A spokesman for the hospital says due to privacy and the litigation, there\xe2\x80\x99s little they can say on the matter, other than \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe that Johns Hopkins met the standards of care for this particular surgery.\xe2\x80\x9d Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys say they will ask for millions of dollars in damages. The case could take up to two years before going to trial.  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com')]"

Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal11w agoInjured Baltimore Orioles catcher Matt Wieters saw some action in an extended spring training game on Tuesday. Wieters, who is coming off Tommy John surgery, threw the ball 150 feet. He also took five at-bats, three coming on the left side of the plate, and two on the right side, according to The Baltimore Sun.Wieters played one game behind the plate during spring training, but he was shut down the next day on March 18th. The Sun reports that he resumed throwing last Wednesday, but hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done any catching or made any game-simulated throws.However, Orioles manager Buck Showalter is hopeful that Wieters could start a rehab assignment sooner rather than later.\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if it was potentially earlier than that. \xe2\x80\xa6 You can tell he\xe2\x80\x99s feeling pretty good,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said of a May 1st start date for Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 rehab stint, via Eduardo A. Encina of The Sun.Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy is just about ready for a rehab assigment, he just needs to get a \xe2\x80\x9clittle catch\xe2\x80\x9d out of the end of his swing, according to Showalter, via The Sun.In Wieters and Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s absence, catcher Caleb Joseph and shortstop Everth Cabrera have handled most of the starting load at their respective positions. Both guys have similar numbers, floating around a .220 batting average through six games, which is about what the Orioles could\xe2\x80\x99ve expected from the replacement players.With Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s return on the horizon, and Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 return not much further in the distance, Baltimore is not far from adding two big bats that would certainly bring more depth to their already strong lineup.In other injury news, according to The Sun, third baseman Jimmy Paredes could start rehabbing this week, as he attempts to return from a lower back strain. Meanwhile, pitcher Wesley Wright is scheduled to head to Sarasota, Florida on Wednesday, as he will get set to deal with a strain in his left trapezius muscle. Wright will sit out the next week, waiting for the inflammation in the muscle to go down, then will be reevaluated. As of now, Wright is expected to miss four to six weeks, but he hopes to be back sooner.\xe2\x80\x9cI think once we get the inflammation out we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to really see the extent of the damage,\xe2\x80\x9d Wright said, via The Sun. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the inflammation goes and I\xe2\x80\x99m able to just proceed normally, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the best news possible. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the main thing, the inflammation, and if I get past that point, strengthen the shoulder and I should be well on my way back.\xe2\x80\x9dThough they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the same impact as Wieters or Hardy, Wright would be a big addition to the Orioles roster, as a lefty arm out of the bullpen. As for Paredes, he obviously doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit in the starting lineup, but he can play a bunch of different positions, and is a switch hitter, so he provides a lot of versatility for Showalter.Next: Orioles Win a Close One Against New York ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Incredible Hitting Streak of Adam \\u2026', 'Apr 12, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones (10) hits a two-run home run during the first inning against the Toronto Blue Jays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones has been on a total tear in the five games the O\xe2\x80\x99s have played at Camden Yards to open the 2015 season. He has done this after opening the season 1-for-12 in the three games against Tampa Bay.Over the past five-game stretch, Adam Jones has been 11-for-17 with a double and four home runs. While knocking in nine runs, he has also been walked once and been hit by a pitch, scoring eight runs.This may be difficult to believe about Jones, but this is his 10th season in the major leagues. He will turn age 30 on August 1st of this year. Adam\xe2\x80\x99s first two years in Seattle only involved about one-quarter of a season the big leagues, but since then he has been pretty much a regular starter.I thought it would be interesting to look back over the previous nine years and see if there are other comparable stretches of the same sort as we have seen in the past week. We know he can be a streaky hitter, but this span has been especially impressive. In fact, I could only find a handful of other occasions that come even close.One of these was just a year ago from April 16th to 21st when Jones was 10-for-21, though he did not hit any home runs and only drove in a total of four. The first of these games was a 3-0 win over the Rays, while the other four games resulted in a four-game split with the Red Sox at Fenway Park.

Again, the Orioles were 3-2 over this stretch. He was 6-for-10 in the first two games which were victories in Texas. The final of the five games was a 6-3 victory over Oakland back in Baltimore where Jones opened the scoring in the first inning with a solo blast.Adam Jones was 12-for-23 with four RBIs (but no homers) in the first five games of 2013. However, this nice start of the season was rather lost when compared to Chris Davis who was 10-for-18 with four home runs and 17 RBIs!\xc2\xa0 (Remember that player?) Also, from May 23 to 26 he hit four consecutive solo home runs \xe2\x80\x93 one per game \xe2\x80\x93 against the Blue Jays in Toronto.The only marginally comparable stretch of game farther back in history is from June 19 to 24 of 2010. Jones was 11-for-21 over these five games with a double, three home runs and six runs batted in. The Baltimore Orioles were only 2-3 against the Padres and Marlins \xe2\x80\x93 those teams tallying 35 runs in five games.So, putting all of this together, the past five games have been the best five-game stretch of his career.If Adam Jones can keep up some measure of similar success over the first couple months of the season, he could do for the Orioles what Nelson Cruz did in 2014. Cruz helped the O\xe2\x80\x99s just barely keep their heads above water until such time as the pitching got into a groove and others began to hit.The Orioles are not playing at a high level at this moment; that is simply the truth, especially with the relief pitching. But there is too much talent and good coaching and leadership for this to continue indefinitely. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are going to fix and straighten out some of these problems. And until then, it might be Jones who prevents them from falling behind terribly far in the AL East.Next: Current and future salary obligations for the OriolesMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore36m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"
04/16/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Resurgence of the Veterans', 'Apr 15, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles designated hitter Delmon Young (left) celebrates with center fielder Adam Jones (right) after scoring during the sixth inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe early portion of this 2015 Baltimore Orioles baseball season has been a bit disquieting in seeing a number of the veteran players really struggling to contribute positively. But several of them made significant contributions on Wednesday night in a good 7-5 victory over the Yankees that put the series of games in the O\xe2\x80\x99s win column.The first among these was Bud Norris. No, it is not like he was the bulldog of a year ago with a great start, but it was an improvement and step in the right direction. We still don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see the O\xe2\x80\x99s starter giving up three runs in five innings, but Norris kept the bleeding from being too bad and in fact registered seven strikeouts with only five hits and two walks. ARod took him deep \xe2\x80\x93 very, very deep \xe2\x80\x93 and that is never a good thing. But perhaps Norris can build on this start and sharpen his control more for the next start.Chris Davis finally had a decent-looking line in a ballgame. He was 2-for-5 with a double and three RBIs. The runs batted in were crucial ones \xe2\x80\x93 the first in the game in the first inning, and a double to drive in a pair in the critical five-run sixth inning outburst that was the difference in the game. Davis still did strike out three times, but he was a factor in the win, and perhaps this too is something to build upon. (However, with 15 strikeouts, he is on pace to total 235 for the season.)Manny Machado has really struggled to get his hits in the early season. He has squared up some balls with little result, but it was good to see him get a solo home run tonight for his first round-tripper of the season. He walked once as well and looked really good running the bases. Machado is the least of the veterans that I\xe2\x80\x99m really worried about.Delmon Young came into this ninth game of the season only .231 on 3-for-13. But he did what he does best \xe2\x80\x93 pinch hitting and getting a base hit to score the go-ahead run in the sixth inning. And he added another hit later. He\xe2\x80\x99s fine.Brad Brach has had some rough outings in the early going. But on this night he was great in two innings \xe2\x80\x93 giving up only an isolated walk while recording the victory. In postgame remarks, Showalter said of him\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cI thought one of the key outings was Brad Brach, especially after sitting around for quite a while and going back out and being sharp again. Brad pitched real well for us the last third of the season and we could really use him to be that same contributor.\xe2\x80\x9dAdam Jones was only 1-for-4 in the game, although his line drive at the shortstop that he hit off the first pitch of Dellin Betances might have been the single hardest-hit ball of the game. And a great defensive play of \xe2\x80\x9crunning down\xe2\x80\x9d a ball over his head was great.

He walked Pedroia to lead things off, then got Ortiz to fly out to right. He threw a wild pitch which moved Pedroia to second, and prompted an intentional walk to Ramirez. That plan worked, as Sandoval grounded into a double play to keep the game tied into the ninth inning.9:30 PM: After O\xe2\x80\x99Day struck out Napoli, Daniel Nava pinch hit for Victorino, but O\xe2\x80\x99Day got him to fly out to Snider in right field to keep the game tied into the seventh inning.9:25 PM: With Hanley Ramirez and Sandoval on base, and Napoli coming to the plate, Buck Showalter brought Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day into pitch with one out in the sixth.9:18 PM: Mujica gets Machado swinging to strand two runners aboard.

That shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been enough reason for Jimenez to hit Sandoval intentionally, but it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting since there is seemingly no other reason for Jimenez to have hit Sandoval.8:19 PM: Snider and Jones each singled to start the fourth inning, putting runners on the corners with nobody out for Davis.

04/18/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Ubaldo Jimenez Beanball in Beantown', 'Apr 17, 2015; Boston, MA, USA; Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter (26) argues with home plate umpire Jordan Baker after starting pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez (not pictured) was ejected for throwing at a batter during the fourth inning against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. Mandatory Credit: Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY SportsI guess that Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez has been so good at the end of spring training and in his first game that his reputation has suddenly changed to being a pinpoint placement pitcher. So, if he comes up and in on a batter, clearly such a highly-refined command pitcher must be intentionally throwing at the hitter! Apparently that is the view of home plate umpire Jordan Baker, as he threw Jimenez out of the game after hitting Pablo Sandoval in the fourth inning Friday night in Boston.As an older writer who is in his sixth decade of watching thousands of baseball games, I have often about how horrible is the current state of umpiring in MLB. Replays two and three decades ago seldom revealed the ump to be wrong, and there was a strike zone that was relatively consistent from night to night.But this was one of the most amazing and egregious calls I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever witnessed. There was nothing to precipitate it, other than Sandoval\xe2\x80\x99s hard slide into second base earlier \xe2\x80\x93 a slide that any ballplayer would view as a legitimate part of the game.Perhaps it will come to the surface that what instigated the event was a beanball war in Tampa on Thursday between the Rays and Jays (with 4 HBPs). Word of that sort of thing gets around, and umpires are informed of such with directives to take command and not let these battles get out of control.In any event, this umpire changed the game, changed the series, changed the road trip, and who knows what else as the dominoes fall relative to relief pitching. We actually may, in time, look back at the Red Sox winning this game 3-2 with a crappy hit in the bottom of the ninth as a moment of good fortune. Going into a pile of extra innings, even if the O\xe2\x80\x99s won the game, might have caused more damage than the lousy ump already has.Jimenez now has pitched 10.2 innings with only one hit allowed, as he had given up none when tossed from the game. However, he had yielded three walks before plunking Sandoval and was pitching from behind in the count too much. But nobody is hitting much off him at all. It will be interesting to see where the rest of the season takes him.Though Orioles fans might feel that the umpire stole a win away from the O\xe2\x80\x99s, honestly the Birds need to score more than two runs. The umpire did not cause that to happen.Up until Brian Matusz walked a leadoff hitter in the 9th inning and wild-pitched him to second from which he would score on the Xander Bogaerts blooper off Tommy Hunter, the only runs by the Red Sox were on a two-run shot by Ryan Hanigan off Kevin Gausman. Boston tallied only four hits on the evening.What is the story right now with Orioles pitching, especially the bullpen? Altogether the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching allowed seven walks on the evening. That is just unacceptable. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day was the only truly effective reliever.The bullpen has now allowed a score in all 10 of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 games so far. That is totally out of character. History would seem to indicate that this is not a trend that will continue. We must say that it is a surprise to see, in that the pen has been the most consistent segment of the team over the past three winning seasons.

He has had some successes in that role in the past, but they have come at portions of the season where his previous work was as a starter. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to this. Could he be slotted into the rotation if Bud Norris continues to flounder?In light of the pitching struggles and the short outing by Jimenez, could the Orioles possibly address the problem by going with an even shorter bench? Could they send down Flaherty and bring up a pitcher, and then replace that pitcher in a week or so with J.J. Hardy coming back? That is probably a pretty \xe2\x80\x9cout there\xe2\x80\x9d scenario, but another short outing this weekend or a long extra-innings game might demand such a bold move.Next: Checking the early season numbers for the Orioles ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Strange Moments during Win over \\u2026', ""Apr 18, 2015; Boston, MA, USA; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Steve Pearce (28) makes a diving catch on Boston Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts (2) during the fifth inning at Fenway Park.

Both teams allowed a lot of runners in scoring position to be left on base. The Orioles were 3-for-9 in RISP situations (with 10 left on base), while the Sox 0-for-9 (7 LOB).Bullpen Saves the Day \xe2\x80\x93 This was the first Orioles game of the season where the bullpen did not give up a run. Chris Tillman put up 5.1 innings of hard work, suffered through dozens of foul balls, and endured a squeezed strike zone at the end.

The encouraging thing, however, was that the Sox were insisting on pitching him outside rather than busting him up and in. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather see this. It allows him to extend, and he extended a 9th-inning two-run homer over the green wall. Nothing could help this team more than Chris Davis getting it together. Ever hear anybody else make that analysis?Scary \xe2\x80\x93 I caught the first inning on the car radio before getting home to see the rest of the game.

In fact, in a Bleacher Report article on the slowest players in baseball history, Papi ranked #12 (Fielder was #2).Add to this the fact that practically NOBODY even tries to steal against Chris Tillman. Runners are 2-for-13 over two years! That is a crazy statistic.So, in the bottom of the fourth inning, with the shift on against Pablo Sandoval, the big guy takes off for third base, and he made it \xe2\x80\x93 because Sandoval grounded out to first. It would have been interesting to see what would have happened. He and Manny Machado had a big laugh about it at third base.Actually, Ortiz scored the only Boston run, racing in from third base on a 50-foot infield grounder muffed by Tillman. Weird.Ryan Flaherty Gets Base Hits! \xe2\x80\x93 Unbelievable. He got two hits off Clay Buchholz, though he did strike out and leave the bases loaded in the 5th inning \xe2\x80\x93 not the only Oriole to leave ducks on the pond. In his final at-bat, he drilled a very hard liner to right field. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be playing more, now that Jonathan Schoop is on the disabled list. And if Scott Coolbaugh can make even a marginal hitter of Flaherty, I say sign the guy to a doubled salary \xe2\x80\x93 Coolbaugh, that is.

But Hanley Ramirez looks as lost in left field as anyone you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen in front of the Green Monster. Drifting back against it, he blew what should have been a catch. On Friday night he total misjudged caroms off the wall.

Good win!Next: Ubaldo's new reputation as a control specialist - apparently!\xc2\xa0 "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), (""Baltimore Orioles: Fans don't pay to see the umps"", 'Fans love using #umpshow on twitter whenever an umpire appears to get out of control during a game. We saw it from the faithful of the Baltimore Orioles last night in the immediate aftermath of Ubaldo Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s ejection at the hands of umpire Jordan Baker. The goal of every umpire\xc2\xa0should be to remain unknown to fans. Baker seemingly ensured that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen last night.I would submit that you know that an umpire has gone too far or is out of control when nobody seems to be stepping up to defend him \xe2\x80\x93 except his fellow umpires of course.

And then Pablo\xe2\x80\x99s next at-bat, first pitch to him [is a] fastball in. It\xe2\x80\x99s close to the head, it was a dangerous pitch, so it\xe2\x80\x99s an automatic. You can give a warning if you prefer to, but he felt it\xe2\x80\x99s an ejection.Read between the lines of that comment \xe2\x80\x93 no umpire (least of all a crew chief) is going to throw another under the bus, nor would I expect them to do so. However Meals said that Baker\xc2\xa0felt\xc2\xa0that it was an ejection. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t emphatically say that he agreed with the decision.Another cause for concern in this is what Meals said at the beginning of the statement above. Fenway Park showed the replay on their Diamondvision of Sandoval\xe2\x80\x99s takeout slide, and he then apparently observed the reaction in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout. So\xe2\x80\xa6umpires are now gauging team reactions and applying that to ejecting someone after a hit batsman without any warning or prior indication of trouble coming down the pike?The side of me that has a minor in American Government says that sounds an awful lot like convicting someone on circumstantial evidence based on the fact that they showed no emotion in the courtroom. As I said above, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear anyone coming out and saying that Baker made the right move by throwing Jimenez out of the game. Heck, Buck Showalter was pretty angry even after the game; he rarely calls out umpires in his postgame presser.In fairness, Baker is a young umpire at 32 \xe2\x80\x93 two years younger than I. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that he was trying to influence the game, and I certainly am not going to suggest that there was any sort of conspiracy or \xe2\x80\x9cfix\xe2\x80\x9d in against the Orioles. I\xe2\x80\x99m steadfast in my belief that most refs or umpires aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing things like that for the wrong reason. I think that Baker just acted on impulse, and unfortunately he thus became \xe2\x80\x9cthe story.\xe2\x80\x9dBut it can\xe2\x80\x99t be overstated that this has implications beyond just that moment in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game. It caused Kevin Gausman to get warmed up in a hurry. While he got out of that inning, he gave up a two-run homer in the fifth. Is it not possible that having to rush his warm-up might not have added to him missing his spot? Furthermore, the Orioles had to use their bullpen for much longer than anticipated yesterday \xe2\x80\x93 which obviously could impact today\xe2\x80\x99s game and the next few.Courtesy of Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY SportsAnd yes, this is all because Jordan Baker over-reacted and ejected a pitcher for no apparent reason. Perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s forgivable in the context that Baker is a young umpire and at some point he\xe2\x80\x99ll learn when to throw someone out and when not to. But his \xe2\x80\x9cyouthful indiscretion\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help the Orioles, who are thinking that every game\xe2\x80\x99s going to count big time in this year\xe2\x80\x99s AL East.Incidentally, I believe that all sports do the routine where pool reporters are sent into the umpires/referees\xe2\x80\x99 locker room afterwards to take any statements the crew might have. To my knowledge, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t required to say anything. However I agree with the legendary former Georgetown University basketball coach, John Thompson Jr. Granted he was talking about college basketball players, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a very true thing to say that if 18-year old kids\xc2\xa0[insert professional baseball players] are required to speak to the media, it\xe2\x80\x99s not unreasonable for the refs/umps to have to do the same.It\xe2\x80\x99s also telling to me that Jerry Meals, a decent umpire and a veteran at that, spoke on behalf of the crew. Granted he\xe2\x80\x99s the crew chief, but it appeared that he wanted to be the voice of the group as oppposed to allowing Baker to speak for himself.As I said, the goal of any umpire is to be unseen throughout the game. And I would submit that while bad calls are rampant in all sports, for the most part they do a very good job of this. However Jordan Baker failed at that last night, and he failed miserably. He should take a few cues from Jim Joyce, who famously cost a Detroit pitcher a perfect game with a bad call in the ninth inning a few years ago. Afterwards after seeing the replay, Joyce tearfully admitted that he blew the call and \xe2\x80\x9ccost that kid a perfect game.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a very public apology, and it was well-received by fans.I suspect that after he gets some mileage under him, Baker will look back on this and know he made a mistake. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help the Orioles right now, for as they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do anything they can to win, they fell victim to an #umpshow last night.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe loss of Jonathan Schoop to a knee injury is simply not good news at all for the Baltimore Orioles. There is a void that will be difficult to fill. This is especially true with J.J. Hardy still out for the foreseeable future. So far, that loss has not been too terribly felt with the reasonably solid play of Everth Cabrera. But it is asking a lot to fill in both middle infield positions.Simply looking at the defensive side of the game, though Ryan Flaherty can likely field as well, he does not have the same arm for turning double plays in clutch situations (not to say that Flaherty is not an above-average defender).On the offensive side, the addition of Jimmy Paredes would appear to be a very effective replacement, but that would be giving up a great deal in the field. If you could have Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s defense and Paredes\xe2\x80\x99 offense in one player, you\xe2\x80\x99d really have something.Will Paredes continue the offensive production we saw in spring training? The optimist says \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d because he came right back to the team and was 2-for-5 with a run scored in his first game. The pessimist says \xe2\x80\x9cnot likely in the long term, or else he would have done it somewhere else before this time.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Both are imaginable, and I suspect we will see a rotation of the three players mentioned here to cover the two middle infield positions.But what if the Orioles need to go deeper into the organization at some point? And how long will Schoop be out?Regarding the second question, there seems to be mixed signals from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 camp. And maybe it is simply too early to say with any confidence. There are the remarks about him simply \xe2\x80\x9crehabbing in Sarasota,\xe2\x80\x9d beginning in a few days. That does not sound so bad. But with Buck saying something about hoping to have him back yet this season; that sounded troublesome.

The early numbers and not good. Janish is 6-for-34 (.176), while Nix is 7-for-36 (.194). At AA Bowie, Derrik Gibson is 9-for-39 at second base, while Ozzie Martinez is 8-for-39 at shortstop (.205). There is also Rey Navarro, who is on the DL as well.Looking at the immediate options in the high minors, the Orioles had better hope that Cabrerra, Flaherty and Paredes can make it work sufficiently until J.J. Hardy can join actively.It is truly a shame to see this situation befall Jonathan Schoop. Like Matt Wieters a year ago, he was off to a great start and looking like the player he was advertised to be. He was 7-for-27 with three home runs and seven RBIs.Between Schoop and Manny Machado, crossing first base successfully appears to be one of the larger risks in baseball. I believe there really is something to be said for the first base bag such as is in some softball leagues \xe2\x80\x93 with a double bag, part in fair territory and partly in foul ground. These are multi-million dollar investments playing the game.One thing for sure \xe2\x80\x93 the Yankees will be pleased to see that Schoop is gone.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore36m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Adam Jones Powers Orioles Past Red Sox 8-3 \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' BOSTON (AP) The Baltimore Orioles lost a couple of quality hitters to free agency during the offseason.

Mandatory Credit: Winslow Townson-USA TODAY SportsThe sport of baseball and the players who play it occasionally display anomalies that stand out as very unusual. At the same time, the game is generally one where, over time, there is an averaging-out of most statistics that do not have a logical foundation.When listening to Baltimore Orioles broadcasts this weekend of games being played against the Red Sox at Fenway Park in Boston, it has been duly noted that second baseman Ryan Flaherty hits particularly well in this stadium. As a bit of a Flaherty skeptic, I am almost tempted to say that if someone only ever hits well in one ballpark, then yes, it does stand out and gets mentioned.Flaherty \xe2\x80\x93 the Rule 5 draftee in 2012 who has stuck with the team now for year #4 \xe2\x80\x93 still does not have a significantly large number of games and at-bats in his career to make many definitive statements (apart from concluding that he looks like a .220-something hitter?). And though the sample size is not huge, his extraordinary numbers at Fenway compared to everywhere else really do stick out as an \xe2\x80\x9canomaly.\xe2\x80\x9dHere they are, compared to everywhere else (at least 20 at-bats) \xe2\x80\xa6Fenway Park, Boston \xe2\x80\x93 22-for-57 = .386Yankee Stadium, New York \xe2\x80\x93 10-for-37 = .270Progressive Field, Cleveland \xe2\x80\x93 6-for-26 = .240Angel Stadium, Anaheim \xe2\x80\x93 5-for-22 = .227Oriole Park, Baltimore \xe2\x80\x93 82-for-365 = .225Safeco Field, Seattle \xe2\x80\x93 6-for-24 = .167 Rogers Center, Toronto \xe2\x80\x93 6-for-36 = .167 Tropicana Field, Tampa Bay \xe2\x80\x93 7-for-52 = .135Everywhere else combined \xe2\x80\x93 14-for-83 = .169So when you look at this list, there really is only one thing that stands out. For some reason he hits extraordinarily well at Fenway Park. The only explanation that I can figure as a possible reason is that he is close enough to home in Maine that his mom cooks for him while he is there.Seriously, growing up in a baseball family in New England (his dad is a college coach), one is a fan of the Red Sox and goes to games at Fenway Park. So these walls are really, truly home for Flaherty. The environment is totally familiar, chowder and all. That has to be it!Actually, his game-tying home run on Sunday was the first of his career at Fenway. Flaherty has now hit 25 career homers, 16 of them at home in Camden Yards.Without a doubt, now that Jonathon Schoop is out of the lineup for some extended period of time, Flaherty is going to be playing more. I have no grievance whatsoever with his defensive abilities; he has great value as a utility infielder. It is his lack of plate production that makes one wonder if there is not some other possibility to provide more punch in the lineup.

Most of the time, the big looping swing is now replaced with a more compact and quick swing. This could make a difference. He is swinging through less pitches.And I am beginning to believe I see the evidence in Flaherty (and a few others) that the Orioles may have definitely upgraded their hitting instruction. If so, Coolbaugh could prove to have been the best offseason improvement and addition to the Baltimore Orioles.

April baseball at Fenway can be a bit of a difficult weather experience, and it was indeed that over the past three days. I have loved visiting Boston several times in my life in the summer months, but for the life of me I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why anyone would actually want to live there year-round.So the Orioles leave town with a series split, 2-2.

Prior to Monday, the Orioles had outscored the Sox 46-24 in the last eight games at Fenway, winning seven of them. Losing a crappy game on a crappy day at a crappy time of the day is no big deal. Move on; they will. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are good at that. Maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll get some better umpires at the next stop.Actually, the rains helped the Orioles. It was unlikely the Birds were going to come back from a 7-1 deficit after 6 innings, so the rains kept the bullpen from having to cover a couple of more innings in a probable losing cause.Just move on. Probably only Ryan Flaherty is sad to leave Boston. He did it again \xe2\x80\x93 knocked in the lone Orioles run with a double off the Green Monster. And he was 2-for-3 on the day \xe2\x80\x93 that is half of the O\xe2\x80\x99s hits. This raises his Fenway average to .400 on 24-for-60 in his career; and his season average is now .333.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll believe he\xe2\x80\x99s a new guy when he does the same at the Rogers Center in Toronto, where he is a career 6-for-36.

You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome!So, yes, on to Toronto and the friends there. The Orioles were 11-8 against the Jays last year, 5-4 in Toronto and 6-4 in Baltimore. They outscored the Jays 74-70.

The Blue Jays won 13-6. Mandatory Credit: Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY SportsBirds of a feather flock together. And there is no flocking going on right now between the Baltimore Orioles and the Toronto Blue Jays. In the real world of birds, blue jays as a species are the ornithological version of a cross between the town bully and village idiot.The Orioles were indeed mugged by the Jays on Tuesday night 13-6, and frankly, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as close as that score would seem to indicate. It was one of the poorest games I\xe2\x80\x99ve witnessed the Orioles play since the infamous days of the Dave Trembley era. Buck Showalter said in his postgame interview on MASN \xe2\x80\xa6We didn\xe2\x80\x99t play very well in a lot of areas of the game \xe2\x80\xa6 We did a lot of things wrong that we normally do right, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy about that. As the game was progressing, I was thinking about how totally annoyed the O\xe2\x80\x99s manager must have been with what he was seeing. The Orioles were making poor plays in the field, bad reads on balls in the air, missing cutoff men and allowing extra bases, and throwing the ball around like a beer league softball game. At the same time it must be said that Toronto was hitting the ball well.However, this O\xe2\x80\x99s team is one that is going to score runs most nights. If they can get some pitching, not be crazy on defense, and simply keep hanging around, they have a chance to get themselves back into a game where they\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed some early runs by the other team.Even so, no team can survive a starter giving up nine earned runs in 2.1 innings and hope to win a game. And that is what Bud Norris did on yet another night when his command iss missing, too many pitches are up in the zone, and even with decent velocity there is no late movement. He was shelled from both the top and bottom of the lineup. Norris is fooling nobody right now.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Another two or three starts?But the flying feathers of this orange and blue bird fight came particularly from Jose Bautista. When rookie Jason Garcia threw a ball behind him, he gave the \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d glare at the 22-year-old. Unless Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day is paying off Garcia to throw at Bautista, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is any chance at all that there is intent.Of course, as would happen, Bautista immediately sends a homer over the center field wall, admires his shot, flips his bat, and displays a blue jay-like Blue Jays attitude with a slow trot around the bases. It did not sit well with the alpha oriole Adam Jones. It took little lip-reading ability to see that Jones was yelling, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s bull poop, and you know it!\xe2\x80\x9dSo there is some bad bird blood between these teams, and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even mentioned the Manny Machado / Josh Donaldson disaffection. Then there is the offseason crap that happened with this organization. But I cannot say that I dislike this emotion and commotion. Bring it on; it is interesting and will add to the fun of seeing the O\xe2\x80\x99s defend their top perch from attack by the bullies and idiots.Fortunately the loss only counts as one loss, and the Orioles will go at it again on Wednesday night with Ubaldo Jimenez taking the hill. Wow, it must be a new year when we are looking at UJ as the current ace to settle down a pitching staff that is getting hit all over the field.Next: The great start of Adam Jones ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles rookie Garcia nearly hits Bautista before home run', 'Toronto Blue Jays\' Jose Bautista swings on a two-run home run off Baltimore Orioles\' Jason Garcia during the seventh inning of a baseball game Tuesday, April 21, 2015, in Toronto. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press via AP)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORETORONTO (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore Orioles rookie pitcher Jason Garcia narrowly missed plunking Blue Jays\' right fielder Jose Bautista in the seventh inning with a 94 mph fastball.Three pitches later, Bautista fired his response over the left-field fence to knock in the home team\'s final two runs in Tuesday night\'s 13-6 win.In standing and admiring the 250th home run of his career, Bautista irked a number of Orioles players, who weren\'t about to simply bite their tongues after the game.""It\'s just wrong,"" said Ryan Flaherty. ""It\'s not him in particular, but he\'s one of the game\'s best players and it\'s just sad that\'s the way he chooses to play the game.""Adam Jones was even more forthright, and defended his pitcher\'s actions as perfectly in keeping with those of a nervous 22-year-old just learning the ropes of major-league baseball.""Respect the game,"" the center fielder said. ""I know he does, but at that moment right there he didn\'t, and when it happens against my team I\'m going to take offence to it.""For his part, Bautista shrugged off the criticism of his actions after connecting on his fourth home run of the year.""I\'m an emotional player and I play with a lot of passion,"" he said. ""You throw at me, I\'m not going to forget and if I get you right after, I\'m going to enjoy it. And I did. I have no regrets about it.""The Blue Jays will have no regrets about how the game unfolded.The first of two Edwin Encarnacion home runs was a leadoff shot that landed on the batter\'s eye beyond center field and sparked a six-run second inning. Three more runs in the third were enough to chase Orioles starter Bud Norris (0-2) after just 2 1-3 innings, less than two weeks after getting yanked only three innings into Baltimore\'s home opener against the same Blue Jays.Encarnacion\'s second homer, for his fourth of the season, was a left-field blast into the top deck of Rogers Centre. It was just the 18th home run to climb that high in the 26-year history of the stadium.Toronto starter Mark Buehrle (3-0) went six innings to get his second win against the Orioles this year. Given the offensive support being provided to the left-hander so far this season - an average of 12 runs a game in his first two starts - his confidence is certainly peaking.""I\'m going to put my name up on the board tomorrow and tell them I\'m pitching and see if it works again,"" Buehrle joked. ""I wouldn\'t want to be the opposing pitcher when I\'m pitching.""Sitting on the other side of the fence, Norris was in a less jovial mood, particularly with two big losses against the Blue Jays in less than two weeks.""It\'s a combination of things,"" Norris said of his recent travails against Toronto. ""The mistakes I\'m making, they\'re not missing . I\'ve got to get back on the horse, keep competing and pitching the corners and because that\'s all I can do.""TURF TROUBLEThe newly laid artificial turf at Rogers Centre was back in the spotlight, as Orioles third baseman Jimmy Paredes was hit in the face during batting practice on a bad hop while fielding grounders. He was OK, but the turf has already been criticized this season for playing too slow, and Orioles manager Buck Showalter, seeing it for the first time cautioned, ""You\'ve got to be careful out there.""UP NEXTOrioles RH Ubaldo Jimenez (1-0) faces Blue Jays RH Aaron Sanchez (0-2) on Wednesday night. Over three career appearances at Toronto\'s Rogers Centre, including two starts, Jimenez has an earned-run average of 8.68.TRAINER\'S ROOMBlue Jays: Rookie second baseman Devon Travis sat out with sore ribs after being hit by a pitch on Sunday. Outfielder Michael Saunders, on a rehab assignment with Single-A Dunedin after knee surgery during spring training, will ""ideally"" join the team in Tampa this weekend, said manager John Gibbons. Starter Daniel Norris underwent an MRI on his pitching arm after suffering what he termed a ""dead-arm phase"" following his last start on Sunday. The test revealed he had nothing more serious than fatigue.Orioles: Shortstop J.J. Hardy, recovering from a left shoulder strain, is with Triple-A Norfolk and hit off a tee and took ground balls Tuesday, but there is no timetable for his return. According to Showalter, catcher Matt Wieters, who is rehabbing following Tommy John surgery, may catch two to three innings on Friday in Sarasota.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

04/23/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Not a Lot to Like Right Now', 'Apr 22, 2015; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Baltimore Orioles relief pitcher Kevin Gausman (39) walks off the field at the end of the sixth inning in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre. The Toronto Blue Jays won 4-2. Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsIt would seem that the time has come for Baltimore Orioles Manager Buck Showalter to have a team rant, or at a minimum a Dutch uncle talk. After a third consecutive loss in style that is not known to be characteristic of the O\xe2\x80\x99s, there is a need for some measure of intervention.At the same time it is only 15 games into the season. And though 7-8 was not the target at this point, the Orioles are still only two games behind the Red Sox. A total of 147 games remain. The Orioles were 8-7 at this point last year. All is not lost.Speaking of 2014, it is the slow start with mediocre pitching of a year ago that gives Birds fans hope that once again a change is in the wind. I will say that I believe that. But some fear of negative trend lines is not unreasonable either.If \xe2\x80\x9cfresh eyes\xe2\x80\x9d was the phrase of a year ago, this year it is \xe2\x80\x9ctrack record.\xe2\x80\x9d Having coached that sport, I\xe2\x80\x99m all about track records and can spew them out as well as baseball statistics. But this is of course a metaphor for the historic performances of players. And indeed, that tends to be the baseline toward which either over-performing or under-performing players gravitate over time \xe2\x80\xa6 most of the time.But a team still has to win on the field, and that is not something the Orioles are doing here in recent days, dropping a 4-2 game to the Blue Jays on Wednesday night.Here are some of the reasons seen in the most recent outing that contributed to a loss \xe2\x80\xa6 ingredients seen in other recent games as well \xe2\x80\xa6Plate Discipline \xe2\x80\x93 Actually, it is the lack thereof that is seen too often. How does a team lose a low-scoring game when the opponent\xe2\x80\x99s starter walks seven batters in 5.1 innings? Beyond that, he departed the game only throwing 83 pitches, with 43 as strikes. It is possible because, in spite of those who worked counts and let themselves get on base, too many others were hacking away. Three Orioles hit a first pitch, three others hit a 1-0 pitch, and another hit a 2-0 pitch. So that is seven batters seeing only 12 pitches.And then when the Orioles have a shot at gaining some runs with the bases loaded and one out in the sixth inning, Ryan Flaherty swings at the first pitch he sees and pops out harmlessly. He must have thought he was still at Fenway. And the final outs of the game come on a first-pitch double play grounder by Delmon Young. In fact, the Orioles went from having runners at first and second with none out in the top of the ninth and a 2-2 count on the batter, to two pitches later ending the game via a strikeout and 6-4-3 play. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look now, but the Orioles lead the American League in grounding into double plays.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore37m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago(Additional added note \xe2\x80\x93 I saw this after publication on Roch Kubatko\xe2\x80\x99s blog and simply had to add it \xe2\x80\x93 is an incredible stat: \xe2\x80\x9cAccording to Sportsnet Stats, Aaron Sanchez is the first Blue Jays pitcher to walk at least seven batters and record a win since Jeff Ware on Sept. 8, 1995. Too much first-pitch hacking with runners on base. Too many runners stranded.\xe2\x80\x9d)Stupid Base Running \xe2\x80\x93 Alejandro De Aza. Wow. He ran the Orioles out of an inning by trying to steal third base with two outs and Chris Davis at the plate. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he was sure he would make it. Not a sure thing! It is so rare to see the Orioles do stupid things on the basepaths, except for this road trip.Striking Out \xe2\x80\x93 This is not an entirely new thing, nor is it the end-all of an offense \xe2\x80\xa6 better to strike out than hit into a double play. But the Orioles are second in the league in this category, though they have somehow offset that by being third in on base percentage. But speaking again of De Aza \xe2\x80\x93 the leadoff hitter \xe2\x80\x93 he now has 17 strikeouts and is on pace to record 184. That is the exact number of the highest strikeout total for a player in the American League last year (though to be fair, that player was Mike Trout!). But with Chris Davis on the team and Chris Carter of the Astros flailing away, he probably can finish no higher than third at the end! So be encouraged.At \xe2\x80\x98Em Balls (by Adam and others) \xe2\x80\x93 Again, in the category of hope, some of the Orioles are hitting very hard-hit line drives right at people. Jones was highly frustrated by a total screamer hit right at the center fielder. Before that, Smoak smoked him in the first inning with a diving catch to double off Jimmy Paredes at second for another double play.

But not for long.It\xe2\x80\x99s something Frank Robinson did more than once, and something any quick-thinking right fielder would do with a slow runner, if the ball got to him fast on a turf base hit, which this was, or if the runner took a very\xc2\xa0wide turn. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t showboating, it was just a good play, regardless of the rest of Bautista\xe2\x80\x99s night. But if that was the play that caused his shoulder injury that kept him out of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game, I\xe2\x80\x99d file it under karma.Bautista\xe2\x80\x99s act of machismo after jawing with Young and Adam Jones caused an injury that was, at least ostensibly, the reason he was kept out of Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s lineup Wednesday night. That reason became realistic when an MRI earlier\xc2\xa0Wednesday showed a strained shoulder, according to multiple sources, and Bautista was listed as day to day.One other reason was that he was 2 for 29 lifetime against Orioles\xc2\xa0starter Ubaldo Jiminez.\xc2\xa0Option three was that the Orioles might deck\xc2\xa0him for real, if the Jays knocked\xc2\xa0Jones down for all the verbal sparring Tuesday night. Bautista stared at his home run off Bud Norris and flipped the bat before his leisurely jog\xc2\xa0around\xc2\xa0the bases. It\xc2\xa0all began with Norris throwing a pitch behind him during the at-bat.At any rate, nothing came of it in Wednesday\xc2\xa0night\xe2\x80\x99s game, a 4-2 Jays victory, featuring what has become a pretty standard lack of timely hitting or good pitching by the Orioles. Sometimes, experts chalk up a trend like this to a team pressing too much so early in the season.On the way to\xc2\xa0being swept by Toronto tonight, Chris Tillman gave the team its eighth straight start of less than six innings, going 4 1/3 before leaving with the Orioles down, 6-0, in an eventual 7-6 loss.

Mandatory Credit: Winslow Townson-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles outhit the Blue Jays on Thursday evening eight to seven, while also hitting two home runs (both by Manny Machado) to only one (by Josh Donaldson) for Toronto. The O\xe2\x80\x99s were 3-for-5 in RISP situations, while the Jays were a poor 3-for-16. So the Birds won the game, right? Nope, they lost it 7-6, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even that close.Orioles pitchers surrendered a total of eight walks, eight!\xc2\xa0 They now lead the American League in free passes, taking over the lead from \xe2\x80\xa6 wait for it \xe2\x80\xa6 the Blue Jays! And they\xe2\x80\x99ve done this without a large contribution from Ubaldo Jimenez.Baltimore now drops to 7-9 on the season, good for last place in the Eastern Division. The good news is that they are only a game behind the Rays and two behind everyone else.It will be good for the Orioles to return to the friendly confines of Camden Yards, having gone 2-5 on the road trip. Though the Birds pulled out two wins in Boston, they never seemed to really recover from the tossing of Jimenez in the first game.But there is more to blame than the pitchers who puts too many runners on base. Not to repeat yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s post that lamented these same themes, it is particularly grievous to see so many of the Orioles constantly throwing to the wrong base, missing cutoff men (who are often late to get into position), and simply not holding the base hit at first base.Trying to cut down lead runners will most often fail, and instead of maintaining the double play possibility, there now exists two runners in scoring position, or even a runner who scored.So the problems are elementary. A baseball team cannot succeed by freely putting men on base and then not containing their movement around the basepaths. With the Orioles coming back from a 7-0 deficit and scoring even four runs in the ninth inning, it illustrates how the Birds are never really out of a game. If only the pitching and defense can contain the expansion of early runs in the game, the offense has a shot at coming back.If Rick Dempsey is correct that nothing good follows a walk, then eight not good things (at least) follow eight walks! This pitching staff needs some fresh eyes to figure out where the strike zone is hiding.

Nobody was more overmatched than Chris Davis who struck out four times. The problem is deeper than the pitching. You can see it all over Davis\xe2\x80\x99 face and demeanor. Pitchers are able to jam him up and in, and they are simply blowing high fast balls past him. Will he figure out? Can he figure it out? It is no longer a \xe2\x80\x9ctrack record\xe2\x80\x9d from the past, but is rather becoming ancient history. I\xe2\x80\x99m not ready to throw him overboard just yet, but until he gets if figured out, he has got to be placed in the bottom third of the order. Even worse news is that Steve Pearce is in a 4-for-42 slump, also looking rather lost.Manny Machado is getting some return. Of course that line quotes a favorite \xe2\x80\x9cBuckism.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Manny has been squaring up some balls for some time and hitting them right at people. I would not be surprised if he does not take off from this point forward.Adam Jones has never looked better at the plate. In recent games it has been simply the greatest sight to see Jones slapping the outside pitches to right field and getting hits. If he takes away the low and outside pitch as an effective tool against him, Jones could indeed have a career year.The collection of middle infielders is paying off. It was a strange sight in the offseason to see Duquette collecting so many middle infielders. As much as he did it for depth in the event of injuries, he also did it to fill a vacuum of such in the upper levels of the farm system. It is now paying off. Ryan Flaherty will be joining J.J. Hardy and Jonathan Schoop on the disabled list, so that is the entire middle infield from 2014. Rey Navarro will be joining the team in Baltimore. If I told you last fall that the three middle infielders on the Orioles 25-man roster at the end of April would be Navarro, Jimmy Paredes and Everth Cabrerra, would you have believed it?There is no better time to turn things around than today and this weekend against the Red Sox.

That may not sound like a feat, however when you aren\xe2\x80\x99t playing well you look at things like that.With Toronto already leading 1-0 after a FC-RBI (resulting from a lead off walk), Josh Donaldson smacked a two-run homer to give Toronto a 3-0 lead in the fourth. Kevin Pillar would add a two-RBI double, and Russel Martin an RBI-double of his own in the fifth. The Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t even able to register a hit until the sixth inning, which was when they broke up Toronto starter Drew Hutchinson\xe2\x80\x99s perfect game bid.But once that was taken care of, things started to happen for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. The perfecto was broken up on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x98s lead off, first-pitch home run in the top of the sixth. An inning later, Travis Snider grounded into a FC-RBI to cut Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s lead to 7-2. The Birds would get the first two runners on base in the top of the ninth, which brought Snider\xe2\x80\x99s spot to the plate once again. He delivered for a second time, with an RBI-single that scored Adam Jones.Courtesy of Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY SportsLater in that ninth inning Machado came to the plate once again, this time with one out and two runners on base. He picked a grand time to register his second homer of the game, this one of course of the three-run variety. That closed the gap to 7-6, making a previously comfortable lead for Toronto turn into a dog fight. However the Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to get any closer than that, and they were swept back to the US with a four game losing streak.Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to sugarcoat a three-game sweep. However if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for silver linings that ninth inning last night is certainly one. Even at a diminished strength due to injuries, these 2015 Birds still have that\xc2\xa0play \xe2\x80\x99till the last out gene that\xe2\x80\x99s common in Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s teams. While the result is still the same at 7-2 as opposed to 7-6, you never know what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.The Orioles have summoned infielder Rey Navarro to join them in Baltimore this weekend, in anticipation of Ryan Flaherty heading to the 15-day DL. Flaherty injured his groin running the bases on the Rogers Centre turf on the final out of Wednesday night\xe2\x80\x99s game. That turf has come under increased scrutiny through the opening weeks of the season, as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come off as having the best traction, and balls seem to die once they hit it. Now that someone might be destined for the DL as a result of it, perhaps Toronto will be forced to change it out.One of the big parts of any Duquette/Showalter team is depth, but the Orioles are now finding some of their depth (in Flaherty) joining their starters on the DL. You have to believe that once this team is back together and complete they\xe2\x80\x99ll start firing on more cylinders. The Birds are hoping that in the next couple of days J.J. Hardy can begin a rehab assignment, after taking 75 swings in the cage yesterday in Norfolk. Getting Hardy back in the near future will probably stablize the infiled and streamline the batting order just a bit.The O\xe2\x80\x99s open up a three-game weekend series with Boston tonight at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. This is the season\xe2\x80\x99s only weekend set in Baltimore between these two teams, which is an odd scheduling quirk. Miguel Gonzalez is taxed with being a stopper for the Orioles, who need to snap a four-game losing streak. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Rick Porcello.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Losses fortunately free of theatrics  ', 'birdswatcher.com'), (""Baltimore Orioles: Missing some keys to the 'Oriole Way'"", 'Photo: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a rocky first three weeks for the Orioles, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take keen-eyed baseball expert to see that. In fact, their futility has been jumping off the screen lately. However, as the clich\xc3\xa9 goes, it\xe2\x80\x99s still early, and the way that the Orioles are losing games should show some glimmer of hope that they\xe2\x80\x99ll right the ship sooner or later.When Earl Weaver became the manager of the Orioles almost fifty years ago he famously instilled his theory of pitching, defense and the three-run homer as the formula for success. It was a formula that eventually became known as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Oriole Way.\xe2\x80\x9d It was also the cornerstone of the successful last three seasons for the Orioles. So far this season, however, the Orioles are struggling in a couple of those categories.The homeruns definitely haven\xe2\x80\x99t been the issue so far with the Orioles. Despite Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s notable absence, the Orioles are first in the league in homeruns. Obviously, he is off to a hot start with the Mariners and the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offensive numbers would look a lot better had he resigned with Baltimore. Yet, despite fear that the Orioles offense would see a significant drop-off in 2015 without Cruz, so far the offense has been strong. It\xe2\x80\x99s the other two factors in Earl\xe2\x80\x99s formula that have been the issue\xe2\x80\xa6Specifically, the pitching. There are a lot of adjectives you could use to describe the Orioles pitching so far, but to save time we\xe2\x80\x99ll just say, really bad. The Orioles pitching has been really bad. In fact, they have been the worst in baseball. They have the worst ERA in all of baseball. They have allowed 84 runs in 16 games. And they have 4 quality starts this season which is tied for last with the 3-13 Milwaukee Brewers.The good news is common sense says this can\xe2\x80\x99t continue. Most of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers who have started this season so poorly have some track record of success at the major-league level, and most are just reaching the prime of their careers. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine 9 of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 12-or-so pitchers having career worst seasons at the same time.The real head-scratcher so far for Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans has been the defense. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 defense hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been just good the past few seasons, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been one of the best all-time. However, this season the Orioles are second to last in the division with ten errors, and there has been probably a dozen or so plays that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been made that the Orioles would have made in the past.Again, the good news is that most of the players have a track record of above-average defense, and a couple Gold Glovers in Matt Wieters and J.J. Hardy should return soon from injury. So, in theory, their defensive struggles shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be something that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem all season.The problems the Orioles have had so far are definitely fixable. However, in a division that looks more competitive than last season, they need to be fixed sooner rather than later, or the Orioles could be digging themselves out of a hole for much of the season.\xc2\xa0 Next: \xe2\x80\x9dBaltimore.\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Dez Wells will throw first pitch at Red Sox vs. Orioles game', 'Dez Wells will throw out the first pitch for Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Red Sox vs. Orioles game at Camden Yards.Dez Wells, the former Maryland basketball star (Ouch\xe2\x80\xa6That is hard to say and even harder to come to grips with) will be on hand for the Red Sox vs. Orioles game tonight at Camden Yards in Baltimore to throw out the ceremonial first pitch.Wells took to Twitter on Monday to make his followers aware of his big day\xc2\xa0and how he thinks he will\xc2\xa0perform from the mound.I will be throwing the first pitch at the Orioles vs. Red Sox game this Friday as well as signing autographs!

REUTERS/Sait Serkan GurbuzMoreBy Lacey JohnsonBALTIMORE (Reuters) - At least 2,000 people protesting the unexplained death of a black man while in police custody marched through downtown Baltimore on Saturday, pausing at one point to confront officers in front of Camden Yards, home of the Orioles baseball team.In the biggest protest since 25-year-old Freddie Gray died on Sunday, two clusters of marchers chanting ""shut it down"" started out at different times before merging during the afternoon into a single wave headed toward City Hall.Gray is the latest in a series of black men around the country who died under questionable circumstances during police encounters. Their deaths have triggered an outcry in the United States over what many see as law enforcement\'s unjustified use of force against African-Americans.Last year, there were weeks of protests across the country following the shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the death of Eric Garner, in New York City who was placed in a chokehold during an attempted arrest.Saturday\'s protests came a day after Baltimore\'s police commissioner conceded that police had failed to provide Gray with timely medical attention for a spinal injury he had suffered sometime after he was apprehended and put inside a transport van. Police have not explained how he sustained the injury. He died a week after his arrest on April 12.During the march, some of the demonstrators confronted about 50 police officers in front of the baseball stadium, where the Baltimore Orioles were due to play the Boston Red Sox at 7:05 p.m. There were no plans to cancel or postpone the game.The demonstrators pushed up against a wall of barricades and waved signs at officers, who stood silently in two lines. Some protesters kicked and dented police cars parked nearby but there was no forceful response by the officers.""The revolution is here! I\'m going to kill you! All of you - guilty!"" one demonstrator yelled as he leaned over a barricade.The marchers then headed for City Hall, blocking traffic on some streets as they passed. Dozens of officers were standing guard at City Hall.A spokesman for Baltimore Police, which used police helicopters to monitor the marchers, declined to comment on tactics and deployment plans for the marches.""What I can tell you is that we will ensure the constitutional rights of every citizen in Baltimore,"" police spokesman Jeremy Silbert said in an email to Reuters.Six Baltimore police officers have been suspended in the Gray case, and an internal police investigation is under way.""We are all united in our demand to indict the six police officers and convict,"" said Sharon Black, spokeswoman for People\'s Power Assembly, one of the rally organizers.On Friday, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said the officers repeatedly failed to give Gray medical assistance and disregarded department regulations by failing to buckle the man into seat restraints in the van.Police have said Gray fled when officers approached him in a high-crime area, but he was caught a short time later and placed in the van. He was carrying a switchblade knife, police said.When the van arrived at the police station, an ambulance was called and Gray was taken to a hospital. He died a week later.Batts said on Friday that investigators were still trying to determine what happened inside the police van. Police said their investigation would be completed by May 1, a day before protesters plan another rally in Baltimore.The department will turn over its findings to state prosecutors and an independent review will follow.(Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis, Frank McGurty and Frances Kerry) ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Walks and errors the story again', 'When you\xe2\x80\x99re mired in a five-game losing streak, you tend to look for some sort of positives.

Gonzalez had his share of struggles, however he certainly pitched well enough for the Orioles to win the game.

That brought the hot-swinging Jimmy Paredes to the plate, and a moment later the 0-0 tie was broken as well. Paredes sent a deep shot towards the flag court in right field, and as the ball became a souvenir the Orioles took a 2-0 lead.However as MASN analyst and Orioles Hall of Famer Rick Dempsey says,\xc2\xa0nothing good happens after a walk. Gonzalez recorded two quick outs in the fifth only to issue a two-out walk (his only of the game) to Mookie Betts. Dustin Pedroia added a single, and Boston covered the corners. However even with David Ortiz striding to the plate, there was still a good chance that the O\xe2\x80\x99s could get out of the inning unscathed given the fact that there were two outs. However it was not to be, as Ortiz homered to right. To top it off, Hanley Ramirez (the next hitter) decided to homer as well, and Boston led 4-2.However keep in mind that the Fighting Showalters are nothing else if not resilant. (And incidentally, while this five-game losing streak is a concern that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why Orioles fans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry too much.) After losing a lead, many teams of yesteryear would just wither away for the remainder of the night. But that was not to be for this team.The Orioles of course had called up Rey Navarro from triple-A Norfolk earlier inCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsthe day after sending Ryan Flaherty to the DL with a strained groin. Navarro had played in the neighborhood of 800 games in the minor leagues, and he made his big league debut last night for the Birds at second base. And the early returns were very good. After the O\xe2\x80\x99s lost the lead, Navarro hit a liner to left field, that was misplayed by\xc2\xa0Hanley Ramirez and ruled a hit \xe2\x80\x93 Navarro\xe2\x80\x99s first as a big leaguer. And that sparked a mini-rally, as Navarro scored on Everth Cabrera\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single to cut the Boston lead to 4-3.Cabrera would also tie the game for the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the seventh with a sac fly-RBI. That of course put Gonzalez off the hook for the loss, and it reset the game. The Orioles would end up in a two-out bases loaded situation with Machado coming to the plate later in the inning. Machado worked the count to 3-2, and sat on a fastball at the end. He got that fastball, however he swung through it and ended the inning with a strikeout.Brian Matusz was brought in to face Pablo Sandoval in the last of the eighth (after Tommy Hunter recorded two quick outs). Matusz walked Sandoval\xc2\xa0(nothing good happens after a walk), and Buck Showalter went to Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day. That prompted Boston manager John Farrell to pinch hit Allen Craig, who reached on a Manny Machado fielding error. It was a bouncy ground ball, that trickled under Machado\xe2\x80\x99s glove; I was a bit surprised they gave him an error on the play, however it was a play that Manny would normally make. After the game, Machado spoke with MASNsports\xe2\x80\x99 Steve Melewski about the error:I\xe2\x80\x99m guarding the line and just trying to make an out. You know how it goes after an error, here comes a big shot. It happened, but we try to battle and keep grinding. It\xe2\x80\x99s part of the game and we have to keep our heads up and go get them tomorrow.Almost predictable, Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Brock Holt came up following Craig and smacked a three-run homer which effectively ended the game. While Chris Davis added a solo shot in the last of the eighth to close the gap to 7-5, that\xe2\x80\x99s as close as the Orioles could get.In the past this team\xe2\x80\x99s been marked by the fact that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t walk people and they played good defense. Right now they\xe2\x80\x99re going through a stretch whereby those things are happening. Now in fairness, the O\xe2\x80\x99s only walked two hitters last night, which is actually very decent if you think about it. However both of those walks came in to score \xe2\x80\x93 the final one of course being the most important.I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry so much about the walks and errors as I would what happens after those things. There\xe2\x80\x99s no difference in terms of the effect if you walk someone or give up a base hit. However it\xe2\x80\x99s what you do to deal with the base runner that makes a difference between winning and losing. And the same is true of errors. If the Orioles can deal with miscues in games better, they\xe2\x80\x99ll start winning again.The series continues this evening at Camden Yards with Wei-Yin Chen on the mound. The Orioles are in need of a stopper, and their hope is that tonight it\xe2\x80\x99s Chen. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Justin Masterson, with game time set for just after 7 PM.

04/26/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Our flag was still there - Birds Watcher', 'Baltimore is of course a city with a very special distinction in that our national anthem was written in our very own harbor by Francis Scott Key. What we now know as the \xe2\x80\x9cStar-Spangled Banner\xe2\x80\x9d began as a poem titled\xc2\xa0The Defense of Fort McHenry, and of course it was inspired by the United States defeating Great Britain in Baltimore during the War of 1812.\xc2\xa0This of course is represented by a line we hear before every Baltimore Orioles game:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6that our flag was still there.Last night\xe2\x80\x99s game presented one of the most bizarre sets of circumstances in the history of Camden Yards. The O\xe2\x80\x99s were getting ready to play Boston, all while people were taking to the streets and violently protesting the death of Freddie Gray in the city. And when I say violent, there were police in riot gear around the ballpark, a 7-11 in the neighborhood was looted (among other stores), windows at Dempsey\xe2\x80\x99s Brew Pub were smashed in, cars were turned over, among other things. However through this, the O\xe2\x80\x99s played on.For starters, Wei-Yin Chen pitched possibly the best outing an Oriole starter has given this year. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 8 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 1 BB, 5 K. While when all was said and done the O\xe2\x80\x99s used three relievers, Chen appeared to have done a great service for the bullpen at the time. And he had the lead early, after Jimmy Paredes\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-double and Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x98 sac fly-RBI in the last of the first.However keep in mind that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are being held to attest to every mishap that they make early this season. Hanley Ramirez drew a four-pitch walk to lead off the second, and Mike Napoli hit a shot to right that grazed off the foul pole for a home run which tied the game. It appeared that the ball was going to go foul, but it stayed just straight enough to touch the pole. However aside from that, Chen was cruising \xe2\x80\x93 while parts of the city figuratively burned.Jimmy Paredes had a great night at the plate, and he\xe2\x80\x99s quickly showing his worth to Buck Showalter and his coaching staff. The O\xe2\x80\x99s took a 3-2 lead in the last of the fifth on Paredes\xe2\x80\x99 solo homer, and for some time all was well in Birdland. As we went to the 9th inning, Zach Britton reliever Chen to close out the game. With the bases loaded and one out, we were reminded once again just how fine the line can be between winning and losing.Pablo Sandoval hit a bouncer to Manny Machado at third. Machado stepped on the bag for one out, and threw across the diamond for what would have been the second out \xe2\x80\x93 which would have ended the game. However Machado\xe2\x80\x99s throw was errant, allowing Dustin Pedroia (who reached on a lead off walk) to score and tie the game. Errors and walks\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s the same story. The saving grace was that Hanley Ramirez (who was behind Pedroia on the base paths) thought the game was over and didn\xe2\x80\x99t take home plate on the throwing error. So in fact, perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake on Boston\xe2\x80\x99s side as well.Xander Bogaerts jumped on the first pitch he saw in the tenth and sent it over the wall in left center, giving Boston a 4-3 lead. So not only was there destructive civil unrest around the ballpark, but the O\xe2\x80\x99s were in the midst of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. To top it off, the mayor requested that anyone at the game stay in the ballpark \xe2\x80\x9cuntil further notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Baltimore City Police were literally blocking the exits of the stadium to prevent people from leaving. That order was lifted as we went to the last of the 10th\xe2\x80\xa6as was the pall that seemed to be over Baltimore and the Orioles.Adam Jones sent a soft liner to right center field to lead off the tenth, that slipped under the glove of a diving Mookie Betts and rolled towards the wall. Jones ended up with a triple, and he would score a moment later on Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 sac fly-RBI. So with David Lough coming to the plate with one down, the game appeared destined for the 11th inning\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6however Boston closer (former Oriole) Koji Uehara gave Lough a hangingCourtesy of Winslow Townson-USA TODAY Sportsfastball on 3-2. And\xc2\xa0Lough delivered\xe2\x80\xa6with a walk off homer onto the flag court. The win tied the series at one, setting up a rubber match this afternoon.

He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Wade Miley.Buck Showalter put this win in perspective with regard to what was happening outside the park after the game (quote courtesy of MLB.com\xe2\x80\x99s Brittany Ghirol):There are so many things that can take your attention away from a baseball game, rightfully so. As important as we think this is, there are some things that are more important.As unfortunate as the ninth inning was, make no mistake about the fact that Baltimore needed this win tonight \xe2\x80\x93 and exactly as it unfolded at that. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about the Orioles simply breaking a five-game losing streak. That plays a role also, however the city itself needed an uplift after so much destruction over the course of the evening.This game was very much a \xe2\x80\x9cBaltimore story.\xe2\x80\x9d The team fought, and just when it looked to be over and done\xe2\x80\xa6a near unknown became a instant hero. And an instant hero when one was needed most at that. Baltimore is a resilent city with a proud past which includes the writing of our national anthem. And with this win, the Orioles showed that exact same type of character last night. Because when the day was done,\xc2\xa0our flag was still there.Next: Baltimore Orioles vs. Toronto Blue Jays: Live Stream, Start Time, TV Info and More 4/25/15  ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: The Little Things that Win and Lose Games', ""Apr 25, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles left fielder David Lough (9) celebrates with teammates at home plate after hitting a walk-off home run off Boston Red Sox relief pitcher Koji Uehara (not pictured) in the tenth inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Baltimore Orioles defeated Boston Red Sox 5-4. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsBefore talking about the topic introduced by the title, let me mention that it is the fourth title that I had for this article following the Baltimore Orioles 5-4, 10th-inning win over the Boston Red Sox on Saturday night. As you surely know by now, it was a David Lough walk-off home run off Koji Uehara that broke the five-game losing streak. Lough has not had a great start this season, just like last year. But what may be forgotten is that on April 12th of 2014, he hit a walk-off single in the bottom of the 12th inning against the Blue Jays that scored Steve Lombardozzi, who had tripled.Here are my other three headlines that, one by one, became obsolete as the evening progressed:When it looked like the Orioles were likely to win the game in regulation, with Wei-Yin Chen posting eight very good innings of two-run baseball, the headline I had already typed was \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jimmy Paredes Hit Parade.\xe2\x80\x9d At that point he was 4-for-4 with a home run that looked to be the game-winning blow, since Zach Britton was coming in to close it out. Oh well \xe2\x80\xa6Britton was not at his best on this evening, but he deserved better than a blown save after the Sox managed to get a run on two infield hits and a Manny Machado throwing error. An accurate throw would have ended the game right there; but instead, it was now tied. For what seems like the umpteenth night in a row, O\xe2\x80\x99s fans could look back to losses where just one play made differently would have changed the outcome. So, in planning to chronicle that, my working title was \xe2\x80\x9cBaltimore Orioles: One Play a Day Away from a Winning Record.\xe2\x80\x9dThat title still would have worked if Boston did win the game on the strength of a top-of-the-10th homer by Xander Bogaerts. But the home team Birds got a leadoff triple from Adam Jones, who scored the tying run on a Chris Davis sac fly (his second of the game) \xe2\x80\xa6 all right before the final winning blast by Lough. So, in thinking about how the O\xe2\x80\x99s utility outfielder has been brutalized in comments by many fans on various boards, I went to a title of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lough-ly O becomes Highly Valuable.\xe2\x80\x9dBut, I next saw that my colleague Nate Wardle was already working on a game summary; so let\xe2\x80\x99s look a bit deeper into three seemingly little things that are examples of what can make a difference in a close baseball game.Relief pitching on a good, damp night \xe2\x80\x93 This is one of the most difficult things to do as a baseball player. It is one of my most distinct memories as a college pitcher who played in the Northeast. Sitting around for hours before being summoned into a cold game is extremely difficult \xe2\x80\x93 much more than starting the game when the temps are a bit milder and there is a long warmup.Both closers got a blown save last night, with Uehara getting a loss as well. The only relief pitcher who looked good on this evening was Matt Barnes \xe2\x80\x93 a young guy making his first appearance of the season in the Bigs. Before this game, his MLB career consisted of nine innings pitched.Obviously, Buck pretty much had to get Chen out of the game after eight innings. It is still April. But I\xe2\x80\x99d bet everything that he would have finished off the game well. Every time you make a pitching change on a cold, damp night, you are asking for trouble; and that is what happened on Friday night when Tommy Hunter was taken out after 1.2 good innings. Just ride the hot hand when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got one!Defensive changes and using the whole roster \xe2\x80\x93 Showalter chose to have David Lough pinch run for Travis Snider in the eighth inning. Yes, this put more speed on the bases in an effort to secure an insurance run, and it almost worked. Lough went to third on a Caleb Joseph single (which Snider could not have done), and should have scored on a suicide squeeze if Rey Navarro had gotten the bunt down.But now Lough is in the game as a defensive replacement.On the other side, the Red Sox manager John Farrell does not choose to replace right fielder Allen Craig with a better defender to protect his one-run lead in the bottom of the 10th.\xc2\xa0 Adam Jones bloops a ball toward right-center that Craig attempts an awkward and ill-fated catch, allowing it beyond him for a leadoff triple \xe2\x80\x93 very dumb. Actually, counting Farrell, it was dumb and dumber \xe2\x80\x93 should make a movie by that title!Baserunning mistakes can kill a team \xe2\x80\x93 The Orioles have had their share of these lately. But the Red Sox had one cost them dearly in the 10th With runners at first and second and one out, with David Ortiz at the plate, Big Sloppy hit a weak ground ball toward second base. Shrub Pedroia, instead of stopping and forcing the infielder to come get him (allowing even the big tortoise to get to first base), or forcing the fielder to throw to first (allowing the Shrub to run safely to second base), he ran right into the out and therefore into a double play. Inning over, cue David Lough.The fundamental things apply as time goes by.And now that the Orioles have broken the silly losing streak and even had a couple of decent starts, perhaps some momentum in the opposite direction can now follow.Next: David Lough Walks Off the O'sMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore37m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('David Lough, Baltimore Orioles Players Rocking Old School ...', ""A couple of the Baltimore Orioles are\xc2\xa0showing off their sock game this weekend against the Red Sox.The city of Baltimore has a lot going on right now and one of those things is the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 sock game.The weekend series at Camden Yards against the Red Sox has given us a glimpse at how amazing a baseball uniform can look when matched with the right socks.On Friday, Adam Jones rocked a pair of stirrups that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been seen since the 1950-Early 60\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0that were last worn in 2010 during a throwback game versus the Washington Nationals.Those socks though. #RockTheSoxpic.twitter.com/rRLOL9qpqR\xe2\x80\x94 Orioles on MASN (@masnOrioles) April 24, 2015Ever since last season, Jones has been sporting a nice-looking pair of black stirrups with three orange stripes as seen below.Apr 18, 2015; Boston, MA, USA; Baltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones (10) singles against the Boston Red Sox during the fifth inning at Fenway Park.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles\' home game against the Chicago White Sox was postponed Monday night because of safety concerns after riots broke out near Camden Yards following the funeral of Freddie Gray.Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, at the stadium for a previously planned visit, said Tuesday night\'s game between the Orioles and White Sox could be moved \xe2\x80\x94 possibly to Nationals Park in Washington \xe2\x80\x94 if safety continued to be an issue.Rioters looted stores and threw rocks and bricks at Baltimore police about three miles from the stadium in the wake of the mysterious death of Gray. He died April 19 after suffering a severe spinal injury in police custody.The Orioles announced the postponement about 40 minutes before gametime. About 1,000 fans were inside the stadium at the time, and many gates already had been closed.The team said the game was called off after consultation with police. The White Sox were in Baltimore for the start of a three-game series.""We feel like we made the decision that would provide us the greatest possible security in terms of protecting the fans, the players, the umpires, everybody involved in the game,"" Manfred said. ""I don\'t know what more I can say about it at this point.""Prior to the game, Orioles players gathered around a television in the clubhouse and watched the violence unfold. Police blocked off several streets near Camden Yards.""There\'s so many things that go on that you get challenged with, obviously this is a different level,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""There\'s not a lot of experience with it.""""So you try to take each moment as it comes and I know there were a lot of calls to some guys\' families about making sure they knew what was going on from a safety standpoint. But guys are watching it. They are all aware of what\'s going on,"" he said.White Sox manager Robin Ventura said his team was aware of the escalating situation.""I mean we\'re definitely keeping tabs on it. If there\'s anything to do, to go ahead and respond to it. But you know, it\'s concerning to anybody, I think, any time it becomes a violent protest, everybody is on high alert and you\'re trying to do what\'s best for the game and the players,"" he said.There was no immediate word on a makeup date for Monday\'s game.Major League Baseball has postponed and shifted games in the past because of unrest.In 1992, the Dodgers had four games postponed in Los Angeles following the Rodney King verdict.In 1967, the Orioles and Tigers had a game postponed because of riots in Detroit. The next two games were shifted to Baltimore.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is ongoing.Monday\'s game was postponed about 45 minutes before the scheduled 7:05 ET start.

There are very real concerns that have to be addressed, or we will find ourselves facing the same scenario over and over again, with only the name of the city changed. But running away isn\'t the answer, and that\'s exactly what baseball is doing. Imagine the surreal sights and sounds from Wednesday\'s game: Empty seats everywhere you look, with only the dugouts and field occupied. The PA system echoing across the stadium. It\'s a scene we\'ve seen in Europe, when soccer clubs have been forced to play behind closed doors as a result of their fans\' reprehensible \xe2\x80\x93 usually racist \xe2\x80\x93 behavior. In this case, however, neither the Orioles nor their fans have done anything wrong. By forcing them to flee their stadium, baseball is giving into fear rather than standing tall against violence and mayhem. And that ought to scare all of us more than anything that\'s happening on the streets.

Monday and Tuesday\'s postponed games will be made up as part of a traditional doubleheader at Camden Yards on May 28.According to John Thorn, official historian for Major League Baseball, this will be the first game with zero attendance. The previous low was 6, for a Sept. 28, 1882 game between the host Worcester Ruby Legs and Troy Trojans. In 2002, the minor league Charleston Riverdogs barred fans for five innings in an attempt to set a record for lowest attendance. All six Orioles games this week were thrown into flux after civil unrest related to the death of Freddie Gray, who died in police custody. It was further complicated when Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake imposed a curfew that lasts through the weekend.The conditions will, in essence, cost the Orioles four home games. Future series against the Rays in Florida will remain there, although the Orioles figure to get a cut of gate receipts from this weekend\'s series at Tropicana Field.And Wednesday\'s game will be unprecedented - the Orioles and White Sox playing in front of merely staff, media and security.The Orioles may be compensated for moving their games. Major League Baseball and the Orioles will have talks regarding lost revenue after the series, according to MLB spokesman Pat Courtney.Using a contingency fund, MLB often compensates displaced teams and emergency hosts for expenses and lost revenue. For instance, the Cleveland Indians didn\'t incur a loss when a foot of snowfall days before their 2007 season-opening series forced a relocation to Milwaukee.GALLERY: PROTESTS DISRUPT CAMDEN YARDSFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInBaltimore protests disrupt Camden Yards\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

There will be no cheering, and no booing. Nor will there be heckling, hot dogs, or beer. There will be no fans in the stadium at all, in fact. After riots in the city forced the postponement of games for two straight days, Major League Baseball announced that the Orioles will play on Wednesday, but the game will be closed to the public.Related StoryTwo States of Emergency in BaltimoreFor a sport that takes significant pride in its history, this may be a particularly sad first: An MLB official told me that after conferring with a historian and several longtime veterans of the game, the league was unaware of any prior examples in which fans have been deliberately barred from attending a game. Those with tickets to the game (or either of the ones postponed) can exchange them for a game later in the season, and they\'ll still be able to watch Wednesday\'s contest on TV. The league is also moving the Orioles\' next three games to Tampa, where they\'ll be the ""home team"" against the Rays at Tropicana Field\xe2\x80\x94a move typically made during emergencies caused by natural disasters, not civil unrest. When rioting erupted in Los Angeles following the Rodney King verdict in 1992, the Dodgers postponed four games until later in the season. More recently, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, forced Major League Baseball to cancel games for a week across the country. Recommended: Nonviolence as ComplianceWhile it hasn\'t happened in baseball, soccer matches overseas have been played in empty stadiums, although those decisions are usually made to punish a team or its fans for bad conduct. MLB teams in small markets routinely play before crowds so tiny that the stadiums probably feel empty. But this is different.Baseball, of course, doesn\'t matter much compared with the pain of parents who lost their son in the back of a police van. It probably isn\'t a concern to the families of officers injured in the riots, or to shop-owners who\'ve watched their businesses get looted and torched. Nobody made that point more eloquently than the Orioles\' chief operating officer (and the son of the team\'s owner), John Angelos, who wrote in a series of tweets on Monday that the systemic problems that led to Freddie Gray\'s death make ""inconvenience at a ball park irrelevant."" Here\'s a partial transcript, via Deadspin: Recommended: The Mysterious Death of Freddie Gray Speaking only for myself I agree ... that the principle of peaceful, non-violent protest and the observance of the rule of law is of utmost importance in any society. MLK, Gandhi, Mandela, and all great opposition leaders throughout history have always preached this proper precept. Further, it is critical that in any democracy investigation must be completed and due process must be honored before any government or police members are judged responsible. That said, my greater source of personal concern, outrage and sympathy beyond this particular case is focused neither upon one night\xe2\x80\x99s property damage nor upon the acts group but is focused rather upon the past four-decade period during which an American political elite have shipped middle class and working class jobs away from Baltimore and cities and towns around the US to 3rd world dictatorships like China and others plunged tens of millions of good hard working Americans into economic devastation, and then followed that action around the nation by diminishing every American\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights protections in order to control an unfairly impoverished population living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state. The innocent working families of all backgrounds whose lives and dreams have been cut short by excessive violence, surveillance, and other abuses of the Bill of Rights by government pay the true price, an ultimate price, and one that far exceeds the importance of any kids\xe2\x80\x99 game played tonight, or ever, at Camden Yards. We need to keep in mind people are suffering and dying around the US and while we are thankful no on was injured at Camden Yards, there is a far bigger picture for poor Americans in Baltimore and everywhere who don\xe2\x80\x99t have jobs and are losing economic civil and legal rights and this makes inconvenience at a ball game irrelevant in light of the needless suffering government is inflicting upon ordinary Americans. The MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday that ""after conversations with the Orioles and local officials, we believe that these decisions are in the best interests of fan safety and the deployment of city resources."" With Governor Larry Hogan deploying the national guard and neighboring states sending in reinforcements, certainly Baltimore police officers have better things to do than protect 20,000 fans at Oriole Park. (Though playing baseball in a burning city is not without precedent, as the Daily Beast\'s Justin Miller noted.) On the other hand, why not simply postpone this game as well? What\'s the point of a baseball game without fans? The ballpark will be eerily quiet, a stark contrast to the unrest outside that will undoubtedly affect both the fans watching on TV and the players on the field. It\'s not how baseball is supposed to be, which suggests that the decision to play the game in an empty stadium is more than just a tactical move; it\'s a statement about the behavior of a fractured city.This article was originally published at http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/04/an-empty-stadium-in-baltimore/391736/?UTM_SOURCE=yahooRead more from The Atlantic \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Brutality of Police Culture in Baltimore \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How Wealth in Childhood Shapes Personality Later in Life ', 'www.yahoo.com')]"

""The last 72 hours in this city have been tumultuous to say the least.""The unique game drew international media attention, but the team\'s message was aimed very close to home.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Orioles manager Buck Showalter reflects on unrest in Baltimore""The Orioles support the city of Baltimore,"" Jones says. ""We play for the fans. We play for the city of Baltimore. People are always watching.""The only visible fans \xe2\x80\x93 actually more audible than visible \xe2\x80\x93 were a handful on the balconies of a nearby hotel and a couple dozen who began chanting, ""Let\'s go, O\'s"" from outside the stadium behind center field.And when the Star-Spangled Banner played to an empty ballpark, that same group maintained a Baltimore tradition - shouting ""Ohhhhhh!"" at the start of the final verse.The game presentation was set up to be as normal as possible \xe2\x80\x93 with the glaring exception of sea of empty green seats.Lineups were on the scoreboard. Orioles players got their normal personalized walk-up music as they came to bat but, as Davis lamented, there would be no crab shuffle game on the scoreboard between innings.Orioles catcher Caleb Joseph tipped his cap \xe2\x80\x93 to no one \xe2\x80\x93 as he jogged to the bullpen to warm up starting pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez, and pantomimed signing autographs before the game.Ball girls were along each foul line. Two scouts watched from behind home plate. The only other people in the seating area were several press photographers and the man who logs the pitch speeds on the scoreboard.But it was undeniable that things were different once the game started.GALLERY: A day without fans at Camden YardsFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInA day without fans at Camden Yards\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

It\'s unfortunate that it\'s escalated to what it has. I think a lot of people were trying to do things the right way. I think there\'s still a long way to go but I think we\'re headed in the right direction.""The baseball reality for the Orioles will be three games at Tampa Bay this weekend, a series that had been schedule for Baltimore. They also face a doubleheader May 28, previously an open date, to make up the games postponed this week.""We need this game to be played but we need this city to be healed first,"" Jones says. ""We\'ve seen good. We\'ve seen bad. We\'ve seen ugly.

""When you look at the picture, it looks like no one is fighting for you. There are people like myself, not only athletes but civic leaders who are effecting change.""""I\'d say to the youth,"" Jones continued, ""your frustration is warranted. It\'s understandable, understood. The actions I don\'t think are acceptable. But this is their cry. Obviously, this isn\'t a cry that\'s acceptable but it\'s their cry and therefore we have to understand it and accept it. They need hugs. They need love. They need support. I\'m going to try to give as much as I can because the city needs it.""On this day, baseball was part of the process.""Baseball, sports, these are things that unite communities in dark times,"" Jones said.But the eerie silence made it clear how different this particular game was.As Orioles manager Buck Showalter said, ""Let\'s not lose sight of why we\'re at this point.""<!-- comment -->CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com')]"

    Slide Show      Slide Show|13 Photos A (Quiet) Day at the Ballpark     A (Quiet) Day at the Ballpark  CreditPatrick Semansky/Associated Press              BALTIMORE \xe2\x80\x94 On what might have been a perfect spring afternoon to sit with a beer and a hot dog and watch baseball, an eerie emptiness greeted the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday in what was believed to be the first major league game played without spectators.Except for two scouts sitting behind home plate and a press box full of reporters, the 45,971 seats and three decks at Camden Yards were an empty expanse of green when the first pitch was thrown at 2:06 p.m. in what became an 8-2 Orioles victory.\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t the way you want to make history,\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Davis, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first baseman, said before he hit a three-run homer in the first inning as Baltimore took a 6-0 lead.The police presence was light around the empty stadium amid the unrest in this troubled city after the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American who died after sustaining a severe spinal injury while in police custody. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Three dozen or so fans peeked through a fence beyond left-center field, shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cOhhh,\xe2\x80\x9d at the familiar moment of \xe2\x80\x9cO say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave\xe2\x80\x9d in the national anthem, a Camden Yards tradition. Still, for the first time in recent memory, the anthem was recorded instead of sung.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Those distant fans clapped and yelled when Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s first batter, Adam Eaton, struck out, and they greeted each Baltimore run with jubilant cheer. A \xe2\x80\x9cGo Orioles\xe2\x80\x9d banner hung from the balcony of a nearby hotel, where other fans gathered to watch. But that faraway support could not relieve a barren afternoon.When the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 leadoff hitter, left fielder Alejandro De Aza, fouled off a series of pitches in the bottom of the first before drawing a walk, one of the balls bounced back onto the field. The other two came to rest among the empty seats and were not immediately retrieved.When Davis followed with a long blast to right field, the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s usual roar of anticipation for a home run was strangely absent. So was the customary scramble for the ball as it cleared the fence and landed on the Eutaw Street walkway. Normally, the street would have been busy with foot traffic for a restaurant, a barbecue stand and the team\xe2\x80\x99s souvenir shop. On Wednesday, though, the walkway was closed. Only a television cameraman stood in the vicinity of the home run.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The stadium was so quiet that Gary Thorne, a television announcer for the Orioles, could be heard exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cGoodbye!\xe2\x80\x9d from his booth as Davis\xe2\x80\x99s shot left the park.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The scoreboard was in operation. \xe2\x80\x9cTake Me Out to the Ballgame\xe2\x80\x9d and John Denver\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThank God I\xe2\x80\x99m a Country Boy\xe2\x80\x9d played as usual during the seventh-inning stretch. But the sound of the ball against the bat left a hollow echo in the vacant stadium. Buck Showalter, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 manager, said the bullpen phone could be heard ringing more than 400 feet from the dugout. Relief pitchers for the Orioles said they could hear strikes called by the umpire Jerry Layne, a rarity in the bullpen, and could even follow the chatter among the outfielders. This only added to a sense of desolation.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In the eighth inning, an announcement was made in the press box that apparently had never been made at a major league game. For official record-keeping purposes, the announcer said, Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s paid attendance was \xe2\x80\x94 pause \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9czero.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gary Thorne does his best Masters voice Video by MLB  Still, there was some levity on the field. Caleb Joseph, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 catcher, gave imaginary high-fives to imaginary fans, and signed make-believe autographs, as he headed to the bullpen for his pregame warm-up. Several times, Davis said, he tossed balls to nonexistent fans behind the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout between innings.\xe2\x80\x9cLaughter does something for the soul,\xe2\x80\x9d Joseph said.Yet early on, intermittent sounds of distant sirens, their source unclear, brought a more somber tone to the afternoon. Adam Jones, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 center fielder and perhaps the most popular African-American athlete in Baltimore, described the turmoil in previous days as a cry of frustration by the city\xe2\x80\x99s youth.

Privacy Policy    \xe2\x80\x9cYour frustration is warranted; it\xe2\x80\x99s understood,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said before the game.At the same time, he said about the destruction of property: \xe2\x80\x9cThe actions I don\xe2\x80\x99t think are acceptable. But if you come from where they come from, you understand. But I think ruining a community that you have to live in is never the answer due to the fact you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to wake up in three or four days and go right back to those convenience stores.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  After postponements on Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game was shifted to the afternoon from its scheduled 7:05 p.m. start because of a nightly curfew here.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThe nightmare of a week continues for the Baltimore Orioles. Not only did they lose two games to postponement because of the unrest \xe2\x80\x93 games that will be played later in May \xe2\x80\x93 they also have to go to be the HOME team at Tropicana Field. That is quite a demotion from the awesomeness of Camden Yards to the hollowness of The Trop.But as Buck always says, you have to meet the challenges that come your way and grind through them, nobody is going to feel sorry for you. Well, I feel sorry for them.In any event, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will be the home team wearing the home whites and sending Chris Tillman to the mound. Tillman has not had the seasonal start he would desire, but you have to know that he is going to get it together, and now would be the time to do it. He comes in with a 7.58 ERA so far, but his career numbers against the Rays are 3.57. As well, Tillman handled the Rays well in the first game of the season, going 6.2 innings with one run on four hits and three walks.Facing the Birds will be Alex Colome making his first appearance in 2015. The young Dominican had visa issues this spring, while also contracting pneumonia. He has only thrown 23.2 career innings in the big leagues, but he has a victory over the Orioles last June 27th in beating Kevin Gausman.The Orioles are 10-10 coming into the game and series, trailing the AL East-leading Yankees by two games. New York is 13-9, Boston and Tampa Bay are 12-10, with the Jays at 11-12.\xc2\xa0like a stink bug floating in the toilet bowl, the Yankees refuse to die.How are the Yankees doing this?It is as annoying as it is surprising that the New York Yankees are winning and leading the AL East. Writers and analysts have been predicting their demise for that last several years. But like a stink bug floating in the toilet bowl (how\xe2\x80\x99s that for a word picture?) the Yankees refuse to die.So how are the Yankees winning? It is not with starting pitching, as they have not been dominant at all. Masahiro Tanaka is now on the DL, and CC Sabathia has been particularly poor.

Miller has eight saves.What has really helped the Yankees is better offence than might be expected. Jacoby Ellsbury and Brett Gardner are setting the table, each with a .406 OBP and batting averages over .300.\xc2\xa0 Chris Young is hitting .305, though his career average is only .235.\xc2\xa0 And while a number of the Yanks are really scuffling at the plate (Beltran \xe2\x80\x93 .162, Drew \xe2\x80\x93 .177, Gregorius \xe2\x80\x93 .206, Headley \xe2\x80\x93 .232), the duo of Alex Rodriquez and Mark Teixeira are hitting homers and driving in runs. A-Rod has five homers and Teixeira has eight with 18 RBIs. The latter is only hitting .216, but 13 of his 16 hits have been for extra bases.All of this cannot continue as it is (except for the relief, which could be the best in baseball). There is no way the Yankees are going to hit and score at this clip long-term.For the Orioles, they do have to grind it out. One thing for sure is that there will be more fans in attendance in St. Pete than their most recent game \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe not many more, but just a few.

05/02/2015,"[('Orioles: No Hope from Rob Manfred for National League DH', 'Apr 8, 2015; Seattle, WA, USA; MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred stands on the field before a game between the Los Angeles Angels and Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field. Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY SportsAs a fan of the Baltimore Orioles and the American League use of the designated hitter in place of pitchers batting, it was my hope that perhaps a change in Baseball Commissioner would lead to a change in the rules. But recent comments by Rob Manfred indicate that is not likely to become a reality, apparently for the primary reason that the debate about the varied rules sparks interest and debate, and he thinks that is good for the game.The discussion rises to the surface again at this time due to the injury of a couple of National League pitchers. Adam Wainwright of the Cardinals will miss the rest of 2015 because of a torn Achilles, while Max Scherzer of the Nationals suffered a thumb injury and missed a start.Manfred\xe2\x80\x99s quote about the situation is this:\xe2\x80\x9cOver the long haul, I\xe2\x80\x99m a status quo person on the DH. I think the difference between the two leagues is a source of debate among fans, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a big believer in the idea of when people are talking about baseball it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xe2\x80\x9dAnother thing that people talk about baseball is that it is boring and low-scoring with little action and offense. Is that good?And what is interesting about watching a pitcher attempt to bat and flail at the pitch after pitch? Yes, a few can handle themselves batting, including our own Zach Britton \xe2\x80\x93 he of the .625 career batting average and 1.750 OPS!\xc2\xa0 But honestly, Britton is very rare.I understand the purist\xe2\x80\x99s argument. There is the view that the pitcher should have to face the thrower on the other team \xe2\x80\xa6 that there is justice and discipline about this. Yes, that was a nice time of baseball history, but the modern game is more specialized, and in my opinion is enhanced by the greater interest of an additional bat in the lineup.And I am a former pitcher making this argument. The American League adopted the change in 1973, when I was a senior in high school. I was thankful for it in college, as, though I could freeze batters with nasty breaking stuff, I never did learn to un-freeze myself at the plate. And a fast two-seamer from a top-tiered pitcher was more than I could handle, so I was glad for the DH rule (though in my college era, both coaches had to agree upon it before the game).But it is crazy to have this situation where one league uses it while another does not, especially now with interleague play. Before the leagues played each other, it was not as strange. But this makes no sense now. It puts the AL at a disadvantage in most cases, though in recent history the AL has had stronger teams and handled the situation adequately.

Again, many disagree with this; but really, why do we have to see only four of the other 29 MLB teams for almost half the schedule? The divisional games of 19 against each opponent totals 76 for the season, only five short of half of all games. I think that is crazy. Do you really enjoy seeing A-Rod and Big Papi 19 times a year? It would be more interesting to annually see all of the great players throughout baseball.Let me finish with a hypothetical illustration. Do you think that the NFL would be better off if, say, the American Conference did not allow any scores from kickers \xe2\x80\x93 the only scoring allowed being to cross the goal line for TDs and conversions. But say that the National Conference allowed field goals and kicked extra points. Would that be good for the game? By Manfred\xe2\x80\x99s measure, it would \xe2\x80\xa6 because it would engender discussion and debate, and that is what is standard for what is good for the sport.There are enough injuries already taking out so many of the great and talented pitchers in baseball, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to add another category of potential loss \xe2\x80\xa6 especially for AL pitchers who are not accustomed to coming to the plate.Next: Schedule implications of riot-postponed gamesCheck out our great Ravens draft coverage:More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore37m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('In Relocated Game, Rays Top Orioles - The New York Times', '     Supported by    Baseball |                            Roundup                                                             In Relocated Game, Rays Top Orioles   By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSMAY 1, 2015    Continue reading the main story Share This Page  Continue reading the main story                if (             window.magnum             && window.magnum.getFlags().indexOf(\'headlineBalancer\') > 0             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.shouldRun()         ) {             window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize();         }        Alex Colome and four relievers combined for a four-hitter, and the Tampa Bay Rays beat Baltimore, 2-0, in St. Petersburg, Fla., on Friday night in a relocated home game for the Orioles.The three-game series was moved from Camden Yards to Tropicana Field this week in the wake of rioting that broke out in Baltimore after the funeral of Freddie Gray, who died in police custody after sustaining a spinal cord injury.Colome (1-0), a right-hander who was reinstated from the 15-day disabled list before the game, allowed three hits and struck out six in five innings in his season debut.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles, in spite of the unusual week for the team and the city, are playing reasonably well as a number of good trends are setting into place.The Birds had a very good all-around game on Saturday evening in St. Petersburg against the Tampa Bay Rays, winning 4-0 behind what was probably the best start turned in by an O\xe2\x80\x99s pitcher so far this year. Miguel Gonzalez was in total command of his pitches, worked efficiently, and got the team through 7.2 very good innings before yielding to Brad Brach.The Orioles are now 11-11 \xe2\x80\x93 three games behind the Yankees, but only two in the loss column.Here are some good trends \xe2\x80\xa6Strong Offense \xe2\x80\x93 The Orioles have hit will over the season so far and are #2 in the American League in team average and #3 in on base percentage. Before this, when have we ever been able to make that latter statement? As well, the Birds have continued to be among the better teams in terms of clutch hitting with runners on base. Last night, Chris Davis kept an inning alive by driving in the first run of the game with two outs. This was followed by Steve Pearce doubling home two more runs. You have to love that.Improved Pitching \xe2\x80\x93 Without doubt, the Orioles got off to a very bad start on the season with the pitching. But this is now coming around. There have been five consecutive quality starts \xe2\x80\x93 one full cycle through the rotation \xe2\x80\x93 and it is no coincidence that the Orioles have won four of those games. The relievers are mostly looking better as well. Having the worst ERA in all of baseball just a week ago, the Birds now are 11th in the AL and rising.

No Gold Glove this year. But he is fine and will be fine. Fielders go through these stretches, as did J.J. Hardy for a few games in 2014. Manny still makes the great plays \xe2\x80\x93 did two of them last night. And the great plays he makes (that few others can) far outnumber the errors he will commit.Steve Pearce at Second Base \xe2\x80\x93 Hey, why not? I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten over not seeing him as an athlete, in that he does not have the sleek body type of such. He has basic baseball skills, and the Orioles have outstanding infield coaching. Pearce will hit (say, in any given stretch of 200 at-bats) better than Ryan Flaherty or Jonathan Schoop, though this may not always be true. His defense won\xe2\x80\x99t be as good, but neither is it likely to be a liability. Some are speculating that this means one of these other players is more severely injured than revealed and not likely to come back. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is it; I think this is Buck building his options.Caleb Joseph is getting it done \xe2\x80\x93 Man, he really caught all of a Chris Archer pitch last night and simply crushed it with a beautiful swing. He is now batting .327 on an 18-for-66; and he also has 10 walks to yield an OBP of .439. \xc2\xa0This is more than just getting it done, it is outstanding.Adam Jones is on the ball \xe2\x80\x93 Last night in four appearances, Jones hit three balls on the dime \xe2\x80\x93 all of them right at someone. He hit another average grounder and got a single. That\xe2\x80\x99s baseball. But Adam looks the best at the plate that we have ever seen.So the trends are pretty much all good.Check out all our Ravens draft coverage:More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore37m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Still looking for a lead-off hitter', 'Photo: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsSomewhere within the chaos of the past week the Orioles won 4 of 5, and now, on the first Sunday in May, find themselves at .500 and only three games back of first place. Given the disarray and complications of the first month, it\xe2\x80\x99s really a great position to be in.Like most teams heading into May, the Orioles have quite a few things they need to improve on, especially if they want to overtake first place by June. One of the most important might be the lead-off position.When the season began, it looked like Alejandro De Aza would be the veteran lead-off batter that could help solidify the lineup all season. However, he struggled through April, striking out 21 times in his first 64 ABs. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of Ks for a player who hits 50 homers a year, let alone a players whose job it is to get on base.Last night manager Buck Showalter hit third-baseman, Manny Machado at the top of the lineup. Machado would definitely fall into the category of \xe2\x80\x98unconventional\xe2\x80\x99 leadoff hitter, something we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Buck do in the past with J.J. Hardy and Nick Markakis.It can be successful, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not an ideal position for Machado or the team. For Machado, he\xe2\x80\x99s probably more comfortable and better-suited lower in the lineup where he can drove in runs. For the team, it\xe2\x80\x99s most likely a stop-gap until a better candidate can step forward.They may find an adequate candidate in outfielder, David Lough. Like De Aza this season, Lough looked like the everyday leadoff man coming into last season, but a poor April at the plate saw him losing playing time by May.Lough\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a poor offensive player was earned during that first month in Baltimore, and has stuck with him over the past year. However, apart from his slow start last season, Lough has hit well when given the opportunity, including hitting over .300 in his last three months going back to last season.His slow start last season could\xe2\x80\x99ve just been the product of his first real consistent playing time at the major-league level, and his production since then could be evidence of his adjustment.It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious Lough is a plus-defender, and his speed makes him an asset on the base-paths. The question will always be his bat. However, with De Aza struggling Lough should get plenty of opportunities in the next few weeks. If he can continue his recent success, he could become a staple at the top of the lineup before long.\xc2\xa0 Next: \xe2\x80\x9dBaltimore.

That signaled to locals that perhaps the situation at home was getting back to normal, or as normal as it could be in the wake of rioting. So all that was left was for the Baltimore Orioles to potentially go out and take two-of-three from Tampa, to hopefully help the city become more whole again.Be they the home or road team, the Tampa Rays seem to be conditioned to playing in Tropicana Field. They seemingly force their opponents to play their style of baseball, which in effect is small ball and pitching. And the O\xe2\x80\x99s this weekend proved that they could do that.\xc2\xa0More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 7 H, 2 R, 2 BB, \xc2\xa04 K. One thing that was a bit of an issue was that Chen seemed to struggle with two strikes. Tampa took a 1-0 lead in the second on a James Loney homer, on an 0-2 count. Chen probably caught just a bit too much of the plate on the pitch. Logan Forsythe followed that up in the top of the fifth on another two-strike count with an RBI-single, and the Orioles were in a 2-0 hole halfway through.With runners at first and second and two outs in the last of the sixth, Buck Showalter was forced to insert Rey Navarro as a pinch hitter for Steve Pearce \xe2\x80\x93 who had to leave the game with an upset stomach. (Sounds like a strange reason to leave a game, but I can sympathize \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there, during a basketball game once.) Navarro swung on the first pitch and lined an RBI-single to left field, cutting the Tampa lead to 2-1.Travis Snider would open up the seventh with a single, and later in the inning Manny Machado would draw a two-out walk. With David Lough\xc2\xa0running for Snider, Jimmy Paredes came through in the clutch with an RBI-double which tied the game and left runners at the corners. That brought Adam Jones to the plate, who was already 3-for-3 on the day. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times over the past few years, great players come through in the clutch when they\xe2\x80\x99re needed the most\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and Jones is no exception. I tweeted this during the game, but Adam Jones isCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sportsone of the best two-strike hitters in baseball. So with two strikes he lined a base hit to center field, which scored both Machado and Paredes. Suddenly the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a 4-2 lead, which was preserved by the likes of Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Zach Britton.The win put the Orioles one game above .500, and the fact is that they\xe2\x80\x99re playing good baseball right now. However the story of the day was Adam Jones. There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody who\xe2\x80\x99s consistently put this team on his back as often or as well as Jones. And the fact is that today it mean a heck of a lot more than just winning a game or a series. By putting the team on his shoulders, he put the hopes and dreams of an entire city on his back.As I said last week, the Orioles are very much in a position to \xe2\x80\x9cown\xe2\x80\x9d the situation in Baltimore, much in the tradition of the New Orleans Saints and Boston Red Sox in situations in their cities. And Adam Jones is exactly the type of player to be the face of that effort. Last night we saw Jones make a mistake in casually getting to a ball after a base hit, and he followed that up with this effort yesterday. Great players have short memories and come through in the clutch.The O\xe2\x80\x99s of course are off today before heading off for a true road trip in New York. They did however return to Baltimore yesterday evening following the game, and will board a train up to New York later this afternoon. The good news for the Birds is that once they get to New York they\xe2\x80\x99ll be in one place (meaning one hotel) until Sunday afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game at Yankee Stadium. They\xe2\x80\x99ll have two games against the NY Mets in Queens, and then four against the NY Yankees in the Bronx. Staying in one hotel for the better part of a week isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly par for the course in MLB, but needless to say it\xe2\x80\x99s shaping up to be a much more run-of-the-mill week than last week was for the Orioles.Next: \xe2\x80\x9dBaltimore  ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsPractically no element of the Baltimore Orioles has been more chronicled and commented-upon than the up and down struggles of Chris Davis, complicated of course by the suspension at the end of last year.The question over the offseason was what sort of player could be expected in 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 a year that is anticipated as well to likely be his final season in Baltimore. Would he repeat the pain of 2014, return to the glory of 2013, or produce something in between in the range of the 2012 season?The answer so far would appear to be the latter of those three possibilities. There are moments and flashes of the \xe2\x80\x9cCrush\xe2\x80\x9d that had one of the greatest power-hitting years ever seen in baseball, yet the strikeouts really pile up at times \xe2\x80\x93 twice reaching to four times in a single game.Currently, Davis has a batting average of .274 and on base percentage of .344, along with six home runs. These numbers are close to his final average/OBP of 2012 of .270/.326, and the home run pace is about the same.So, expanding his current pace to a full season, it should end up looking like 2012, or perhaps just a slight bit better. That would probably be acceptable to most Orioles fans, especially if the team can see the pitching staff settle out to consistent performances like a year ago, and see also the return of some critical pieces like J.J. Hardy.But how has this start of the season compared to the past three full years in Baltimore at the same time? Here is a quick look at his first 23 games in each of the four years\xe2\x80\xa6YearABHRRBIAVGOBPSO201584618.274.34437201480213.263.37827201379824.354.44822201279513.316.36820\xc2\xa0There is little to ever compare to the unbelievable start/middle/finish that Davis had in 2013, but what can be possibly taken away from this analysis?Without doubt, the strikeouts are now at an all-time high, and that seemed impossible to imagine after last year. But there is decent production, so that would indicate either he is hitting reasonably well in clutch situations or others around him are on base ahead of him. And the answer is a bit of both.

As the league has exposed new ways of getting pitches past him and defensing him to take away strengths, Davis is continuing to adjust to take advantage of different opportunities now open to him.Adjustments. It is huge for all players, but especially for Chris Davis. Certain weaknesses and tendencies have been terribly exposed. The strikeouts demonstrate it, as do the hard-hit balls into the shifts. But modifications are increasingly seen as well.So to answer the title question as to if Davis\xe2\x80\x99 performance is good enough \xe2\x80\xa6 It is close to acceptable. And maybe that is all that could be hoped for in 2015, and if the production can come at critical times, it will be more than good enough.Next: Hardy and Flaherty are back on the field\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

Keep swinging the bat, keeping bringing that attitude, keep bringing that fire.\xe2\x80\x9dFor the Baltimore Orioles it was also another day of injuries and roster moves. This time it is Kevin Gausman with shoulder tendinitis. It does not sound terribly serious, but it is neither something we want to be hearing. One has to wonder (and not just with Gausman) if the disrupted schedule has had something to do with this. I think the time is past for fooling with him as a reliever. Bring him back as a starter \xe2\x80\x93 through Norfolk, then eventually back to the Birds.

I\'m just mad I didn\'t catch it,"" the Gold Glove center fielder said after Friday night\'s 5-4 loss to the New York Yankees.Jones banged into the wall with his left side and shoulder. As he jumped at the fence, the ball deflected off the wall, perhaps glancing off the outstretched glove of a fan. Rodriguez wound up with his first triple since July 2012.""I think he\'s going to be a little sore tomorrow. The only thing he said when I got out there was \'I should have caught that ball,\'"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter recalled. ""I looked at the replay between innings and couldn\'t tell if it was the shoulder or a ribcage. We\'ll see.""Showalter came out from the dugout to check on Jones, a four-time Gold Glove winner.""He plays the game so hard you, wonder why more of that doesn\'t happen,"" the manager said. ""It\'s never about drama with him.

Baltimore dropped to 12-15, matching its season worst of three games under .500.""I was missing by a little bit,"" Gonzalez said. ""It\'s tough because we know that they\'re hitting the ball really well, and you can\'t make any mistakes, especially early in the game.""Left-hander T.J. McFarland, recalled from Triple-A Norfolk when Kevin Gausman went on the disabled list due to right shoulder tendinitis, relieved Gonzalez. McFarland had been scheduled to start for the Tides against Buffalo and was still in Virginia at 2:30 p.m.He arrived at Yankee Stadium about six hours later and said he took the mound only 15 minutes after that.""Crazy day. One minute I thought I was starting a game down in Norfolk, and then I\'m coming in in the fifth inning,"" he said. ""I showed up in the bullpen and the phone was already ringing when I opened the door.""He had exited LaGuardia Airport quickly.""I couldn\'t wait even 10 minutes,"" he said.

This was all a grassroots effort from people who missed out on the Orioles after games cut off in Baltimore.But Monday, fans say they saw the rise of Orioles magic. It\xe2\x80\x99s the atmosphere fans say they have missed\xe2\x80\x93baseball in Baltimore, met with a little Orioles magic. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s Camden Yards. It\xe2\x80\x99s my hometown. It\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest place in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stacey Wrobel.  Monday was the first home game since the Orioles played to an empty stadium and then moved the next home series to Florida. It all came after a protest became violent outside of Camden Yards on April 18. During ReOpening Day, fans came and celebrated throughout the day. \xe2\x80\x9cThings are getting back to seemingly normal. It\xe2\x80\x99s good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Levi Smith, O\xe2\x80\x99s fan. The fan excitement was acknowledged by Orioles manager Buck Showalter. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me. Instead of putting the orange carpet in center field, we should have the orange carpet at the gates because it\xe2\x80\x99s their Opening Day as much as anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Showalter. And while everyone didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it to Camden Yards to enjoy the game, a lot of people celebrated ReOpening Day throughout the city. O\xe2\x80\x99s fans took part in activities at Pratt Street Ale House as part of the ReOpening Day in Baltimore. While back at Camden Yards, fans were cheerful. \xe2\x80\x9cI think everybody\xe2\x80\x99s spirits are high and everyone\xe2\x80\x99s here just to support the Orioles and support Baltimore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dale Knight.

Vendors were hawking food, drinks and clothing. A few people were camped out near the home team parking lot, seeking autographs. About a half-dozen were looking to buy tickets at the window in the B&O Warehouse behind the center-field wall. There was one police car visible on the north edge of Camden Yards. It was a stark contrast to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 last game in Baltimore. The city had been overrun by violence on April 27 after the funeral of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died while in the custody of Baltimore police. Then, in an unprecedented move, the Orioles hosted the Chicago White Sox on April 29 without allowing fans to enter. The Orioles had postponed two games against the White Sox before their no-fan game, then played three \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d games against the Rays in Florida. The team said it took steps to ramp up security before Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game against Toronto, but there were no protesters outside the gates before the contest. There were no helicopters soaring overhead. No angry people throwing bottles. No rows of police in riot gear. Inside the stadium, the home team wore jerseys with the script word \xe2\x80\x9cBaltimore\xe2\x80\x9d across the front instead of the customary \xe2\x80\x9cOrioles.\xe2\x80\x9d Once the game got started, the crowd of 20,468 had plenty to scream about. Soon after the fans yelled \xe2\x80\x9cO!\xe2\x80\x9d during the \xe2\x80\x9cStar-Spangled Banner,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez struck out the side in the top of the first inning. In the bottom half, Manny Machado hit a leadoff homer and slugger Chris Davis added a two-run drive for a 3-0 lead. Adam Jones also homered in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 5-2 victory. Monday also marked the beginning of Preakness Week, beginning the buildup to Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s Triple Crown horse race. Track officials say good weather could lead to record attendance numbers at Pimlico Race Course. The Orioles hoped hosting a baseball game might have a positive effect on a city still very much in recovery mode \xe2\x80\x94 and get the week off to an encouraging start. \xe2\x80\x9cWe understand it\xe2\x80\x99s just a game and there are other bigger things going on out there,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles reliever Zach Britton said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anything, the fact that we can come home and play again and have our fans here, maybe that will get some people\xe2\x80\x99s focus off what was going on out there. Just enjoy baseball again.\xe2\x80\x9d The vendors outside the park were happy to be back at work. \xe2\x80\x9cI missed out on a lot of money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Danny Little, who was selling hot dogs, sausages, sodas and chips. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I got a 3-month-year-old daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d Looking back to two weeks earlier, when the rioting started in earnest and caused the first postponement of the series against the White Sox, Little recalled, \xe2\x80\x9cWe were watching the TVs when they were lighting fires and all that.

Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY SportsTuesday night was a good evening to miss watching the Baltimore Orioles, as the Birds dropped an ugly game to the Toronto Blue Jays, 10-2.I really did miss looking at it. The second Tuesday of the month is always a full-evening board meeting, and all I can do is sneak a look here and there at summaries on the phone.Reading about it later confirmed what was obvious from my scant peaks at the game periodically. I did not need to read anything other than the box score to see that defensive lapses killed the Orioles.As good as the Orioles were in all components of the game on Monday night, they had plenty of stink to go around on Tuesday evening. Fortunately it only counts as one loss, and the Birds have a chance to win the series tonight.Today is the 13th of the month, but for the Baltimore Orioles all the bad luck seemed to happen a day early. Ryan Flaherty joins the substantial squad on the DL.\xc2\xa0 Top prospect Hunter Harvey is reported to have elbow issues of concern. And Rule 5 draftee Jason Garcia is suspected of something not being fully correct, as his velocity is down.The latter situation could prove fortuitous for the Birds. It has appeared for some time now that keeping Garcia on the roster for the full season was not going to be easy to do. The word is that Mike Wright will be coming to take his spot on the roster and provide bullpen help.

He was the 2011 third-round selection (#94 overall) of the Orioles out of East Carolina University.Wright would appear to be that player who has grown and gained experience along the way and is really putting it together now. He was only 5-11 at AAA Norfolk last year, but it was his end of the season that had everyone excited. Over his final seven starts, he went 4-2 with a 0.95 ERA in 47.1 innings. Wright allowed 35 hits and held opposing batters to a .202 average over that span. He did not give up a run in his final 24.1 innings of the season, including taking a no-hitter into the ninth inning on August 21 at Durham.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore38m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d agoThe beginning of Wright\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 season at Norfolk is not quite that good, but it is not bad at all. In six games he is 3-0 with a 2.64 ERA, giving up 25 hits in 30.1 innings. His WHIP is a very fine 1.11.Like many top prospects, he has been a starter over his minor league career. In 91 games, he has been the starter in all but four of them. So relieving will be a different experience for Wright in the big leagues.Also of interest over the past couple of seasons at AAA \xe2\x80\xa6 his numbers against left-handers are actually a bit better than that of right-handed batters. As Buck says, it is important for a pitcher \xe2\x80\x9cto be able to defend himself\xe2\x80\x9d against the opposite dominance.Though I understand the intrigue about Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s big arm \xe2\x80\x93 a skill that really can\xe2\x80\x99t be taught \xe2\x80\x93 it is just not working out.

05/14/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles Score a Triple-Double and Hat-trick', 'May 13, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles pitcher Miguel Gonzalez (50) throws a pitch in the second inning against the Toronto Blue Jays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsMany fans of the Baltimore Orioles were distracted away from baseball on Wednesday evening by the playoffs for the nearest NHL and NBA franchises \xe2\x80\x93 the Capitals and Wizards. Sadly for those fans, each Washington team lost by one, while the Orioles put together an all-around good game in a 6-1 victory over the Blue Jays.Usually a \xe2\x80\x9ctriple-double\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chat-trick\xe2\x80\x9d are terms applied to basketball and hockey, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll use them to speak of the outburst of the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the second inning that catapulted the Orioles to a series-clinching victory. Three consecutive doubles provided all the offense that Miguel Gonzalez would need while providing 7.2 innings of three-hit pitching.Caleb Joseph knocked in the first two Orioles runs with a line drive double past Josh Donaldson \xe2\x80\x93 gotta love that! He was then driven home by Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s double, who in turn scored on a third double by Alejandro De Aza.Another sight to love was seeing Jose Bautista rolling a weak grounder to his least-favorite opponent, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, on the first pitch of relief from the O\xe2\x80\x99s submariner. O\xe2\x80\x99Day would register his first save of the year by also shutting down the Jays in the ninth inning.

De Aza made a great running catch in the right-field corner. Rey Navarro jumped high to snare a line drive, and Manny Machado made a diving tag on a grounder to pick a runner off third base \xe2\x80\x93 a critical moment of the game.But the critical player of the game was Miguel Gonzalez, who at one point set down 14 straight Jays hitters (helped by the defense) and registered five clean innings.After seven starts, Gonzalez is now 4-2 with a 2.93 ERA and WHIP of 1.14.\xc2\xa0 He has a goal of pitching 200 innings for this season, and he has 43 in the books so far. The year is now exactly one-fifth over, though it not likely that Gonzalez would get 35 starts \xe2\x80\x93 more like 30 is probable if he stays healthy. Assuming that, he is on pace right now to therefore pitch 185 innings.As we have compared the season start of some other Orioles players (like Adam Jones) relative to other seasons at the same point, let\xe2\x80\x99s do the same for Gonzalez. Here is what his first seven games (as a starting pitcher) over the past four years look like when put together (recalling that the games in 2012 began in the middle of the season) \xe2\x80\xa6YearInningsRecordERAWHIP201243.24-23.711.31201342.12-24.251.35201437.21-34.781.542015434-22.931.14\xc2\xa0So Gonzalez is off to a good start, as these stats illustrate from previous years that he has tended to get better as the season goes along.You gotta love Gonzo and his work ethic. He is truly a pitcher, not just a thrower. And he has developed more late life on his pitches over his time with the Orioles.More good news for the Birds is that he will have two more seasons before becoming eligible to be a free agent.The Angels come to town on Friday night with Jared Weaver pitching against Wei-Yin Chen.

The Baltimore Orioles came undone at the seams in Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s loss to Toronto. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen in a second consecutive game. If anything, we saw some of those same characteristics from Toronto in last night\xe2\x80\x99s 6-1 Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 victory. How quickly things change.Part of why what happened on Tuesday was so tough to watch was due to the fact that Chris Tillman looked so good. The same was true of Miguel Gonzalez last night, as he gave the Orioles about as solid of an effort as one could. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7.2 IP, 3 H, 1 R (unearned), 5 BB, 5 K. At one point in the second half of the game Gonzalez retired 14 straight hitters. When guys are being retired left and right, it\xe2\x80\x99s tough for them to hurt you.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

The Orioles opened up the last of the second with two consecutive walks, and for once it was the O\xe2\x80\x99s who ended up making an opponent pay for that. David Lough sacrificed both runners into scoring position, and Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x98s two-RBI double gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 2-0 lead.Joseph would later score on a Machado RBI-double, and Machado would make the score 4-0 on Alejandro De Aza\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-double. Just for good measure, Jimmy Paredes would close out the inning with an RBI-single, giving the Orioles a 5-0 lead. The rest was all pitching, and thus all Miguel Gonzalez.Gonzalez did get some help from the spry Manny Machado at the hot corner, who tagged out a runner off the bag on a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice in the third. Kevin Pillar would score on a Caleb Joseph passed ball in the eighth, to account for Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s lone run. However in the last of the eighth the Birds got that run back on Rey Navarro\xe2\x80\x98s first career home run at the big league level.But ultimately when you\xe2\x80\x99re mowing down the opposition left and right it\xe2\x80\x99s tough for them to do much. 14 consecutive retired batters is pretty impressive. So from the ashes of Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s loss, the Orioles rebounded and ended up taking two-of-three from their division rivals. If you can continue to take series\xe2\x80\x99, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find yourself in good shape.There had been rumors for weeks around town to this effect, but yesterday the Orioles formally announced that the Angelos family was \xe2\x80\x9cmaking the stadium workers whole,\xe2\x80\x9d and compensating them with their normal salaries for the games missed due to the civil unrest.\xc2\xa0While it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily popular to point out the virtues of a multi-millionaire, I do feel that this is something on the part of Peter Angelos that\xe2\x80\x99s worthy of our praise as a society. He was under no obligation to pay those people, and in fact the Orioles themselves are one of the local businesses who lost money due to all of this.It\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to say\xc2\xa0he can afford it, and so forth. That\xe2\x80\x99s the snarky or petty way to look at it in a sense. But in this age of the bottom line being everything, here\xe2\x80\x99s a businessman who cared more about his employees, their well-being, and that of their families, than how much he was making. Peter Angelos is an owner who gets a lot of criticism, some of it justified. But regardless of what you think of the guy, there\xe2\x80\x99s no other way to describe this act but by saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s a decent and commendable thing to do.  ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsHere on the FanSided Sports Network, this Baltimore Wire site is a part of the Locals Division \xe2\x80\x93 covering an array of professional, college and other pertinent sports in a geographical region. There are also specific sports sites for each professional team and major colleges as well. In addition, there are general sites for the professional sports.Our general interest baseball site publishes a weekly power rankings with summaries of the ups and downs of each team. Baltimore Orioles fans may not like the current edition. It is difficult to argue that the top team should not be the St. Louis Cardinals, due to their great start, with the Royals second. Having the Dodgers third might be debatable. But having been walloped pretty good by the Mets and Yankees, we in Baltimore can sadly see why they would (at least for now) get noticed and be fourth and fifth.The Orioles come in at 19th in this rankings systems. Wow. Just barely out of the bottom third. But before we get as offended as we were by offseason writers who predicted the O\xe2\x80\x99s to have a definitive losing record, let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest enough to understand that their 15-17 record projects to a final total of 76-86.So where would we honestly expect to see the Orioles ranked, based upon how they\xe2\x80\x99ve played so far? To be truthful, 19th is about right. However, we all know that they are a much better team than what the record indicates. We have reasonable confidence that they are going to play much better and be far more often \xe2\x80\x9cin the WIN column\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 as we hear on O\xe2\x80\x99s radio. But right now, they are not.Another sort of rankings system that grades teams with a more complicated formula than win/loss records is seen on the great baseball-reference.com web site. I say \xe2\x80\x9ccomplicated\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 though it is not really so by sabermetric standards, and is called the \xe2\x80\x9csimple rating system.\xe2\x80\x9d You can see it in the far right column of the standings.The system gives a score to the number of runs a team is better or worse than the average team, taking into account run differentials and strength of schedule. The Orioles are currently at a positive 1.0, while the Yankees are the best in baseball at 1.5.\xc2\xa0 If you click on the heading, it will sort the teams in each league in order, placing the Orioles at fifth in the AL. And only the Dodgers in the NL have a higher number than the Birds. In fact, the 24-11 St. Louis Cardinals are worse than the Orioles at 0.9, while of course the Phillies are dead last with a negative 1.9 number.

Without doubt, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have had to play many of their games against teams that are performing currently at a high level \xe2\x80\x93 higher than expected, perhaps.\xc2\xa0 But there is no way to put a truly pretty face on the beginning of this season for the Birds. It has been a disappointment in many ways.Today begins the final push of 130 games remaining. Caleb Joseph said that, in baseball terms, that number is an eternity. Yes, but, we need the see some definitive turnaround. And a good time to start that is right now.The Orioles today host the Angels for three games before welcoming the Mariners for three from Tuesday to Thursday. The Tuesday game is also the first of 21 games played over a 20-day period. A total of 14 of the next 17 games will be played in the friendly confines of Camden Yards.So NOW is indeed the time to make some moves and get back to playing well above .500 baseball.

Yep.The good news in all that is that the Orioles lie only three games under .500, and probably only four games out of first place.The rest of the AL East isn\xe2\x80\x99t faring any better.The New York Yankees are currently in first, but the team\xe2\x80\x99s pitching is surviving on smoke and mirrors. Masahiro Tanaka is on the DL, and if he comes back, there is no guarantee he will be able to stay healthy. Chase Whiteley might need Tommy John surgery. Michael Pineda got shelled last night. C.C. Sabathia is a shell of his former self. Adam Warren and Nathan Eovaldi are not going to do well for an entire year in the AL East.The Tampa Bay Rays are in second, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t pretty. The team can\xe2\x80\x99t score many runs, being only built to pitch well. Drew Smyly is done for the year, as is Alex Cobb. \xc2\xa0Alex Colome and Nathan Karns are pitching well, but can it last all year? Plus, no matter how good their pitching is, the O\xe2\x80\x99s match up really well against Tampa.Third, somehow, is the Boston Red Sox. Their pitching is in shambles.\xc2\xa0 They fired their pitching coach already. They have the worst team ERA in the American League. Justin Masterson has looked awful and is now on the DL. Their starters all have ERAs at or over 4.50. Porcello is at 4.50, everyone else is over 5.00. Wade Miley isn\xe2\x80\x99t working out. And several of their older stars have started to show signs of age.

Mark Buerhle is 5-2, with an ERA over 5. That is largely because of the number of runs scored.\xc2\xa0 The team put up over 10 runs in his first three starts. R.A. Dickey has looked like he might be washed up. Jose Bautista is hurt, thanks to his antics trying to throw out Delmon Young at first base. Edwin Encarnacion has the home runs, but the rest of his stats are down.So, while the Orioles are last, their problems look minor compared to those in the division. The Orioles have started slowly for several years now. Last year they were around .500 at the end of May. The division is more competitive this year for sure. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like anyone is running away with the division.But, so far the Orioles just need to put a few things together. They keep getting good pitching, but no hitting. Or maybe it is the other way around. The team just needs to put it all together.For Oriole fans, it has been frustrating so far.\xc2\xa0 But I think better days are ahead, especially with all the carnage in the AL East.Next: MLB Power RankingsMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore38m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"
05/17/2015,"[('Wright Shines In Debut As Orioles Blank Angels 3-0 \\xab CBS ...', ' BALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Mike Wright took a three-hitter into the eighth inning of his major league debut, and the Baltimore Orioles ended the Los Angeles Angels\xe2\x80\x99 five-game winning streak with a 3-0 victory Sunday. Adam Jones scored on a wild pitch in the fourth inning and added a two-run double in the eighth to help Baltimore salvage the finale of the three-game series and improve to 1-12 when scoring fewer than four runs. Wright (1-0) allowed four hits, struck out six and walked none in 7 1-3 innings. After giving up an eighth-inning single to Matt Joyce, the right-hander was removed by manager Buck Showalter and walked off the mound to a standing ovation by many in the crowd of 41,733. Brad Brach struck out the last two batters in the eighth, and Zach Britton worked the ninth for his eighth save. Wright outpitched Los Angeles starter Garrett Richards (3-2), who gave up two runs and five hits in 7 2-3 innings. Wright started 91 games over five minor league seasons before joining the Orioles on Wednesday to supply depth in the bullpen. But after starter Chris Tillman developed back spasms, the Orioles called upon Wright to fill the void. Selected in the third round of the 2011 amateur draft, the 6-foot-6 Wright was clocked at 98 mph on a fastball that produced his first major league strikeout, a swing-and-a-miss by Mike Trout. Wright retired the first nine batters before Kole Calhoun led off the fourth with a single. After Albert Pujols doubled with one out, Calhoun was erased in a rundown and Wright struck out Johnny Giavotella. That would be the last time the Angels got a runner past first base until the ninth. Baltimore went up 1-0 in the fourth when Jones reached on an infield hit and scored with two outs when Richards bounced a curveball that got past catcher Carlos Perez. Jones made it 3-0 in the eighth with a two-out double off Mike Morin. TRAINERS ROOM Angels: RHP Cory Rasmus (left core muscle) is moving toward throwing off a mound as he recovers from surgery in March. Right now he\xe2\x80\x99s long-tossing as he strives to leave the 60-day DL. Orioles: Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s back spasms have lessened but he remains questionable to start against Seattle on Tuesday. Also, the Orioles are monitoring the health of RHP Bud Norris (bronchitis), who was scratched from his scheduled start Saturday. ON DECK Angels: LA opens a four-game series in Toronto on Monday with LHP C.J. Wilson (2-2, 2.63 ERA) on the mound. Wilson has a 1.25 ERA in his three road starts.

The hitting, the pitching, the fielding, base running, and the relief pitching.The Baltimore Orioles started the season with good hitting, struggling relief pitching, a few starters struggling, and fielding that was iffy.By the end of April, fielding was still a concern, starting pitching was improving, the relief pitching was fine, and the hitting was tailing off a little.Now, in the middle of May, the starting pitching has been pretty good, except for Bud Norris and Chris Tillman. The fielding has improved recently. The relief pitching remains good, despite a few blips recently. The baserunning, and other fundamental errors, are now starting to decrease.But the hitting by the team is really struggling.

The team moved into what had been Baltimore\'s exclusive broadcast territory since 1972.The Orioles have majority control of the network. When the sides couldn\'t agree on the Nationals\' rights fees for 2012-16, the teams appeared before an MLB panel.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Marlins introduce GM Dan Jennings as manager after \'organic\' processThe panel consisted of Pittsburgh Pirates President Frank Coonelly, Tampa Bay Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg and New York Mets chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon.The panel said last June the network should pay the Nationals about $298 million from 2012-16, starting at about $53 million for the first year and rising to nearly $67 million for 2016.When the network didn\'t comply, the Nationals tried to end the agreement. MASN and the Orioles sued, contending a conflict because the law firm Proskauer Rose represented MLB and the teams of all three arbitrators. They also said the process was tainted because MLB gave the Nationals a $25 million loan in August 2013 in anticipation it would be repaid after the decision.Justice Lawrence K. Marks last August blocked the Nationals from ending the rights deal while the case proceeds in New York Supreme Court.Three lawyers for the Orioles and MASN spoke for 1 hour, 40 minutes Monday, and attorney Carter G.

Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal11w agoCourtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsIt\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say what part of Wright\xe2\x80\x99s outing sat the best with Orioles fans. The zero walks sticks out at me, as does the fact that he was consistently hitting between 96-98 MPH on the gun. Wright was throwing strikes; at two different points in the game, he retired nine straight hitters (including the first three innings).Unfortunately for Wright, he was matched almost point-for-point by Anaheim starter Garrett Richards. However we almost saw a total role-reversal from Saturday night\xe2\x80\x99s game in terms of the O\xe2\x80\x99s being the team who got small breaks which led to runs. With one out Adam Jones reached on what amounted to a swinging bunt down the third base line.And that small feat was all the O\xe2\x80\x99s needed to get things started. Demon Young singled, giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s runners at the corners. Following a Davis strikeout, Garrett Richards uncorked a wild pitch \xe2\x80\x93 which allowed Jones to score from third. Whereas on Saturday it was Anaheim getting a rally started on two infield singles, yesterday it was the Orioles reciprocating with some excuse-me moments of their own.But the big story of the day was Wright. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be stressed enough how good he was. He also had rapport with catcher Caleb Joseph, who had caught him at triple-A Norfolk. So it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be lost on fans that Buck Showalter gave Joseph a rare day game after a night game start, which probably put Wright a bit more at ease. But regardless of who was catching, Wright shut down a pretty decent lineup \xe2\x80\x93 and one that has two potential future hall of famers (Trout and Pujols) at that.I thought for sure that Buck Showalter would have gone to the bullpen after the seventh inning, however he sent Wright back out there. After striking out David Frees, Matt Joyce singled to center. That brought Buck Showalter out of the dugout, and brought the 41K plus at Camden Yards to their feet. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to imagine how great of a feeling it had to be for Wright to get a standing O like that after his outing. It also says something about the Baltimore fans, who know and appreciate good pitching when they see it.Manny Machado singled in the last of the eighth, and that was followed up by Jimmy Paredes legging out an infield single. That brought Adam Jones to the plate, and his two-RBI double gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s some breathing room at 3-0. It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go unstated that Jimmy Paredes made that happen as much as Jones did. He never stopped hustling as Johnny Giavotella tried to throw him out from second base, and he thus avoided recording the third out of the inning. Anaheim put two runners on in the ninth, however Zach Britton pitched out of it and closed out the game.After the game Buck Showalter was about as complimentary as a manager could be about his young starter (quote courtesy of Roch Kubatko of MASNsports):I was watching him warm up. His presentation was real confident. He\xe2\x80\x99s done some things the way it used to be done, where you make every stop and you do things at a level where you\xe2\x80\x99re not wondering if you had done real well at the level you left. That\xe2\x80\x99s the blueprint of coming through.It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear what will happen now with Wright. Buck Showalter said that the plan is for Miguel Gonazalez to start on Tuesday (after tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s off day) against Seattle. The Orioles are also evaluating Tillman and Bud Norris, who Showalter said was cleared to play today (and was available out of the bullpen).Wright certainly atoned for himself to where it would be a shame for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to send him back down to Norfolk \xe2\x80\x93 although one start should also be taken with a grain of salt to a point. However it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible that he could stay and work out of the bullpen, or even continue starting in the rotation if Tillman (or even Norris) has to go to the DL.As I said, one start should be taken with a certain grain of salt, and thus taken at face value. But the face value of Wright\xe2\x80\x99s outing is that it was as good as one could have dreamed. Needless to say, not every start is going to go like that. But he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly off to the \xe2\x80\x9cWright\xe2\x80\x9d type of start!Next: \xe2\x80\x9dBaltimore  ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles, Nationals In Court Over TV Revenue Dispute \\xab CBS ...', ' NEW YORK (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles, Washington Nationals and Major League Baseball were in court for four hours Monday in a dispute over television rights fees. Justice Lawrence K. Marks didn\xe2\x80\x99t immediately issue a decision. The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network was established in 2005 after the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington and became the Nationals. The team moved into what had been Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive broadcast territory since 1972. The Orioles have majority control of the network. When the sides couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree on the Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 rights fees for 2012-16, the teams appeared before an MLB panel. The panel consisted of Pittsburgh Pirates President Frank Coonelly, Tampa Bay Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg and New York Mets chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon. The panel said last June the network should pay the Nationals about $298 million from 2012-16, starting at about $53 million for the first year and rising to nearly $67 million for 2016. When the network didn\xe2\x80\x99t comply, the Nationals tried to end the agreement. MASN and the Orioles sued, contending a conflict because the law firm Proskauer Rose represented MLB and the teams of all three arbitrators. They also said the process was tainted because MLB gave the Nationals a $25 million loan in August 2013 in anticipation it would be repaid after the decision. Marks last August blocked the Nationals from ending the rights deal while the case proceeds in New York Supreme Court. Three lawyers for the Orioles and MASN spoke for 1 hour, 40 minutes Monday, and attorney Carter G. Phillips asked Marks to throw out the arbitration decision and either appoint a new arbitrator or tell the parties to pick someone from the American Arbitration Association to rehear the dispute. \xe2\x80\x9cThe one thing you cannot do is send it back to the same group,\xe2\x80\x9d Phillips said.

05/19/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Review of Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson', 'Mar 28, 2015; Tampa, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Tyler Wilson (63) throws a pitch during the first inning of a spring training baseball game against the New York Yankees at George M. Steinbrenner Field. Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY SportsWith the Baltimore Orioles now calling up their current top pitching prospects Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson, perhaps you are a bit like me and get these two players confused. Unless you are an O\xe2\x80\x99s fan who lives near and attends one of the affiliates and has seen both of these players pitch, all we have personally experienced of them are a few televised innings in spring training. Add to this that both of them have last names beginning with a \xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 it can sort of run together in the mind.But we are apparently going to see both of these players pitching some innings in the coming week or two. Bud Norris has been put on the disabled list \xe2\x80\x93 a move that I certainly applaud. He was having enough troubles in 2015 before getting sick and losing weight, etc. There is nothing good about the entire situation. The wisest move right now is to let him get his health back and essentially make a new start on the season with some rehab games in the minors.If all goes well for Norris, perhaps he can be a contributing factor in the second half of the year. At 16-19, the Orioles can\xe2\x80\x99t just be throwing him out there because they are paying him a lot of money. They need to win, and there are other options, at least for now, that give them better chances to get back to the top of the AL East.Mike Wright \xe2\x80\x93 3rd round choice in 2011from East CarolinaAny way you look at it, Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 7.1 innings of shutout baseball was an impressive start for Wright. Obviously he can\xe2\x80\x99t do that every time out, and there were a few \xe2\x80\x9cnear misses\xe2\x80\x9d on Sunday that could have broken through with a run or two for the Angels. But the guy was good \xe2\x80\xa6 very, very good.A year ago at this time Mike Wright was not pitching well at all for the Norfolk Tides. In a series of seven games from May 11 through June 17, he gave up 4,7,5,5,7,4,4 earned runs. It was an ERA over that stretch of 11.44.But, as he had done as well at AA, Wright turned this around for the end of the season. In his final seven games (and 47.1 innings), his ERA was 0.95. He only allowed 35 hits, while striking out 37.For the first six games of this 2015 season at Norfolk, though he gave up a few more runs than the end of 2014, his ratio of relatively few hits and high strikeouts was much the same.Combining these stats of the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 Wright\xe2\x80\x99s most recent series of 13 starts from 7/25/14 through 5/8/15 \xe2\x80\x93 he has thrown 78 innings and only given up 60 hits while striking out 67. And there were only 15 walks in those 78 innings. Altogether, it comes out to an ERA of 1.62 and WHIP of 0.962!The entire picture would seem to present a fellow who struggled with inconsistency over a three-year period, but who has learned and figured out a successful pitching plan to have success. Why not put him out there and prove that he can\xe2\x80\x99t do it successfully in the big leagues?\xc2\xa0 He has control, plus pitches, and upper 90s velocity. It is a winning combination.Tyler Wilson \xe2\x80\x93 10th round choice in 2011 from VirginiaWilson is currently 2-4 with a 3.43 ERA for the Tides. Batters are hitting .273 off him, while he has a WHIP of 1.22.\xc2\xa0 So this is not bad, but neither is it \xe2\x80\x9clights out\xe2\x80\x9d stats.

Returning for the first time since signing as a free agent with Seattle in December, Cruz hit his major-league leading 16th homer with two on in the third inning to give the Mariners a 4-1 lead.Earlier, as he headed to the plate for his first at-bat, Cruz received a warm ovation from the crowd of 19, 494, many of whom shouted ""Cruuuze!""""It was nice, but I wish we would have played well enough to win the game,"" Cruz said. ""It\'s a shame.""Paredes singled in two runs in the fourth inning and added a two-run drive off Danny Farquhar (0-2) in the sixth. Starting on a regular basis for the first time in his career, Paredes has reached base in 20 straight games and ranks second on the team with 22 RBIs.On this night, the Orioles got the better of Seattle and Paredes outdid Cruz.""That feels great because he\'s a big man right there,"" Paredes said. ""A lot of fans root for something big from him, and we changed the game.""After being a part-timer with Houston, Kansas City and the Orioles, Paredes has finally found a home as Baltimore\'s designated hitter.""It\'s great. It\'s an amazing season,"" said Paredes, who spent the first two weeks on the disabled list.Cruz, meanwhile, heard cheers after his home run \xe2\x80\x94 even though it put the home team in a hole.""That was nice,"" Cruz said. ""The whole game in right field I heard good things. It makes you feel good.""But Cruz let a ball get past him in the outfield, an error that provided Baltimore an unearned run and an 8-4 lead in the seventh.""No excuses. That\'s a routine play,"" he said.Miguel Gonzalez (5-2) allowed four runs and struck out eight over seven innings. He retired 13 of 15 batters after yielding Cruz\'s home run.After Seth Smith opened the game with a home run, the Orioles got an RBI single from Steve Pearce in the bottom half after Smith robbed Adam Jones of a home run with a leaping catch at the left-field wall.In the third, Gonzalez walked .129-hitting Chris Taylor, Robinson Cano singled and Cruz hit a hanging curve over the center-field wall.Baltimore tied it at 4 in the fourth when Caleb Joseph hit an RBI single and Paredes delivered a two-out, two-run single.The Orioles went ahead for the first time in the sixth. After successive doubles by Alejandro De Aza and Joseph produced a run, Paredes drove a 3-1 pitch into the left-field seats.LEADING OFFMariners: Smith\'s homer was the second of his career to open a game. His first was on July 1, 2014, as a member of the San Diego Padres. It was the second leadoff homer of the year for Seattle (Austin Jackson, April 19 versus Texas).Orioles: Leadoff hitter Manny Machado stole two bases for the second time this season, matching his career high. He has now stolen a career-best seven bases for the season, surpassing the six he stole in 2013. He is 7 for 8 in stolen base attempts this season.TRAINERS ROOMMariners: Jackson (right ankle sprain) went 1 for 4 and played center field Tuesday for Triple-A Tacoma after playing seven innings on Monday. ""We would like to see him swing the bat a little better than he has been,"" manager Lloyd McClendon said.Orioles: RHP Kevin Gausman (shoulder tendinitis) will pitch batting practice for Baltimore before its game at Miami on Saturday. He\'s been on the DL since May 8.ON DECKMariners: Roenis Elias (0-1, 3.24 ERA) will start Wednesday night. Seattle is 0-4 in his four starts even though the left-hander has not allowed more than three runs in a game.Orioles: Wei-Yin Chen (1-2, 2.53) has one win in seven starts despite limiting the opposition to a .211 batting average.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

Armando Ben\xc3\xadtez vs. Tino Martinez 1998  This is one of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s most famous fights of all time. It was a classic bench and bullpen clearing scuffle between heated division rivals. Darryl Strawberry and Alan Mills portion of the fight was probably the highlight. 2. Mike Mussina vs. Bill Haselman 1993  Mussina plunked Haselman and the battle royal ensued. Another one of the classic dust ups that broke into several different altercations as tempers flared. 3. Manny Machado vs. Fernando Abad/Josh Donaldson 2014  Ok this one isn\xe2\x80\x99t a brawl like the other two but an interesting story line. Manny Machado and Donaldson had words in Oakland and when they came to Baltimore it seemed the bad blood continued as Abad threw at Machado and Manny let loose his bat down the third base line. 4. Kevin Gregg vs. David Ortiz Sox 2011  David Ortiz doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like being pitched inside. Kevin Gregg pitched it in and then way in and Papi\xe2\x80\x99s temper took over from there. They finished the at-bat with a pop up, the exchanging of words then possibly the most pathetic fight between two big guys that has ever been recorded. Ever. It\xe2\x80\x99s like someone told them to fight without using their hands. 5. Big Papi vs. Dugout Phone 2013  After watching Ortiz swing and miss in the fight with Gregg you also see him swing, miss, strike out and then finally connect while taking out his frustration on the dugout phone.

Alvarez takes the mound Friday night as Miami looks to avoid an eighth straight defeat in the opener of a three-game series with the visiting Baltimore Orioles.

Stanton is 2 for 18 over his last five but is 3 for 7 with a homer off Ubaldo Jimenez, who takes the hill for the Orioles (18-20) looking to continue his solid run.

Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY SportsFor the second time this week, it was the offense of the Baltimore Orioles that simply outscored the opposition and gave the team a victory. The O\xe2\x80\x99s were able to tally eight runs on 11 base hits, assisted also by seven walks, as they beat the Marlins 8-5.This is the team we expected to see in 2015. It is a squad with more than adequate pitching talent, but a team also that would look to have the firepower to overwhelm opponents even on evenings when the pitchers are struggling.And Friday evening was a struggling night for the pitching staff. Ubaldo Jimenez was not as sharp as in other outings this year. His fastball did not have the run or sink we have been seeing, and he only lasted four innings. The Marlins opened to an early 3-0 lead.And all totaled, the Orioles pitching staff would yield 14 base hits \xe2\x80\x93 though they were scattered. And many of them seemed to have eyes to make it between infielders (honestly a common theme this year). But the Marlins were only given one free pass from Orioles pitching \xe2\x80\x93 who for the second straight day had a \xe2\x80\x9cbend without entirely breaking\xe2\x80\x9d sort of effort. Miami was a combined 3-for-15 in RISP situations.Tommy Hunter (also for the second consecutive day) got the Orioles out of a jam and pitched two scoreless innings. Rookie Tyler Wilson registered his first career win in relief of UJ.The game-changing play was a throwing error by the Marlins\xe2\x80\x99 starting pitcher Henderson Alvarez, who fielded a bunt from J.J. Hardy (on a 3-2 pitch \xe2\x80\x93 who says Buck doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like small ball?) and failed to get the lead runner at third base by wildly throwing the ball into the left-field corner. The resulting run tied the game and set up a total turnaround.The big hits for the Orioles were a trio of two-RBI knocks.Delmon Young again displayed his great pinch-hitting skills by batting for Ubaldo in the fifth inning and driving a ball over the center fielder\xe2\x80\x99s head for a two-run double.Perhaps the biggest hit of the game was the tie-breaking two-RBI single in the sixth inning by Caleb Joseph. He looked overmatched by Marlins reliever Steve Ciscek, but with two strikes really centered a ball by driving it hard up the middle and into center field, giving the Birds a 5-3 lead.Manny Machado had a two-hit, three-RBI night in front of his hometown crowd, with his best hit being a two-run double in the top of the 8th inning to give the O\xe2\x80\x99s a four-run cushion at 8-4.Jimmy Paredes continued with his amazing hitting by going 3-for-5 on the evening. He is now batting .353.But most of all it was good to see Joseph have a good game. Even though the very impressive Dee Gordon stole four bases on the evening, I would put those steals against the pitcher (three against Jimenez). But Caleb stroked three singles along with a walk to raise his average to .279.\xc2\xa0 After batting .327 in April, Joseph had trailed off to only .196 in May \xe2\x80\xa6 before Friday night.So the Orioles have now won four of their past five games.

The Marlins won 1-0. Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY SportsAnother series loss for the Baltimore Orioles on Sunday, as they lost 5-2 to the Miami Marlins, who had looked lifeless until Saturday night.The Orioles were beaten by a team that honestly, looks better than them. The Orioles starting line up on Sunday was as follows:Manny Machado 3BDavid Lough LFJimmy Paredes 2BAdam Jones CFChris Davis 1BEverth Cabrera SSRyan Lavarnway CAlejandro De Aza RFMiguel Gonzalez SPYep, that\xe2\x80\x99s not pretty.\xc2\xa0 After the first four, lots of easy outs there. Now, Cabrera did pretty well, but the rest did not.Lavarnway really blew it, striking out with bases loaded as the go-ahead runner. De Aza continued to struggle. Davis didn\xe2\x80\x99t strike out as much, but killed one rally by swinging at the first pitch with the bases loaded and getting an out at first base.And that led me, as well as several other people I interact with, to lament the lack of options. It also seemed like J.J. Hardy was out, as he should have been used to pinch-hit at some point.So, here are some of my thoughts.1) Designate Lavarnway for assignment and call up Steve Clevenger. Clevenger may be out of options, it is tough to find a reliable source on how many players have options remaining. And Matt Wieters will ideally be back in about 10 days. So maybe this is only a short-term option. But I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of Lavarnway, as he seems to do nothing to help the team win.2) Let David Lough get more playing time.\xc2\xa0 Travis Snider and Alejando De Aza have continued to get more playing time than Lough, despite showing next to nothing. Letting Lough get more playing time would be one thing I would do to shake up the outfield.3) Call up Nolan Reimold and designate Alejandro De Aza. De Aza has not done well. Reimold is heating up in the minors. The problem here is that Reimold is also out of options. so when Jonathan Schoop returns and a roster spot is needed, Reimold could be lost as well.4) Put Bud Norris in the bullpen and keep Mike Wright in the rotation. As of right now, there is room for this. Eventually, that may not be the case. But, I think Norris could be a great reliever (I advocated him for closer in 2014 before Zach Britton took the position and ran with it.)

The AL East is still up for grabs, and I think eventually the O\xe2\x80\x99s are going to grab control.\xc2\xa0 But right now, this is a .500 team. Some changes are going to need to be made, particularly as numerous players come back (Wieters, Norris, Schoop, Flaherty).

The Marlins won 1-0. Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY SportsThe word came down from Major League Baseball that Baltimore Orioles relief pitcher Brian Matusz will face an eight-game suspension related to the substance found on his arm in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game against the Marlins. Joe Garagiola made the announcement on Monday morning, coming from his position as senior vice president of standards and on-field operations for MLB.The ruling was not really a surprise, since a similar situation and suspension had been announced just days ago against the Brewers\xe2\x80\x99 Will Smith. It is also no surprise that Matusz and the Orioles are going to appeal the decision.I generally dislike these sorts of situations and writing about off-the-field matters, baseball ethics and that sort of thing. But here are the thoughts going through my mind at the moment\xe2\x80\xa6The problem with this ruling is that whatever he gets \xe2\x80\x93 be it eight games, reduced to four games, whatever \xe2\x80\x93 the Orioles will be punished in the sense of having to play with a 24-man roster. That is the bigger problem than losing Matusz, who is honestly an average to slightly above average (especially against lefties) relief pitcher.It would appear that Matusz is guilty of the infraction. And it clearly is a violation of the rule. But that raises the next question \xe2\x80\xa6Is it a big deal? The answer is probably not. That \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody\xe2\x80\x9d does it is a weak justification, even if everybody does something of the sort. There is a rosin bag out there. I suppose he could slow down the game between every pitch and load up on the sticky \xe2\x80\xa6 take a walk around the mound. Would MLB like that?Brian Matusz is one of the very last people in baseball I would expect to be a blatant, in-your-face violator of rules. I sometimes wonder if the guy has a pulse and if the competitor inside him has much bite or energy; it certainly has no bark.Few people sweat as profusely as Brian Matusz. He pretty much always looks like he just came in out of a rainstorm. He has a very fair complexion, and the overheating is seen in his cheeks and face, etc. I could imagine that this might make for some challenges for him in firmly gripping the baseball at times. Remember how this was a part of the entire discussion in the offseason when it was revealed through his physical that he had high blood pressure \xe2\x80\x93 a family issue.

Others have done that. But nope \xe2\x80\x93 don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. I think he is just a fidgety and nervous mess most nights.Was it small and bush-league of Marlins Manager Dan Jennings to make a deal of this? Pretty much \xe2\x80\xa6 yes! At the moment it happened, you, me and Jennings all had the same number of career wins as a big-league manager. You know what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.MLB probably has to follow through with some measure of punishment, and maybe, hopefully, it will be less than eight games. But hopefully also this opens a discussion on how to be more reasonable in these matters, as even the batters don\xe2\x80\x99t want 95+ MPH fastballs slipping out of pitchers\xe2\x80\x99 hands.That\xe2\x80\x99s about enough of that.

This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a reflection on Davis per se, as much as it is on how much he\xe2\x80\x99s struggling at the plate right now. Sometimes a full day off is exactly what a guy needs to get himself going. Incidentally, that\xe2\x80\x99s no different than anyone else at any other job.However as a team I would submit that the Orioles are a bit overly-predictable. One thing I noticed during yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-3 win over Houston was that there were times when the Houston fielders didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to move. And this is something I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed all season long \xe2\x80\x93 and even in past years. Ironically Chris Davis is actually fairly good at hitting to the opposite field \xe2\x80\x93 but only when he\xe2\x80\x99s in the lineup and makes contact with the ball.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerBut on numerous times, both on popups to the outfield and even infield grounders, there are plenty of times in which the Birds literally hit the ball directly to the fielders. \xc2\xa0And quite frankly if you\xe2\x80\x99re an Orioles fan, that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a problem. What that effectively means is that the spray charts show guys hitting the ball to basically the exact same spots with consistency. And it allows teams to perfectly position their fielders so as to all but ensure the Orioles record outs.Instead, Houston appears to have a bit more of a balanced attack at the plate. In the fifth inning of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game Evan Gattis hit a ball the opposite way at a moment when the Oriole outfield was shaded towards centerfield. Had the outfield been playing straight away, odds are that would have been a long flyball out.The good news for the Orioles is that they found a way to change this dynamic a bit yesterday. They got a decent start from Wei-Yin Chen, although he probably pitched better than his stats indicate. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 11 H, 3 R, 0 BB, 6 K. Chen was replaced in the top of the sixth by Brad Brach, who also incredibly solid. Oliver Drake and Zach Britton closed out the game for the Birds, who showed shades of their strong 2014 bullpen yesterday.The way in which the Orioles changed the dynamic was by using the longball \xe2\x80\x93 which has evaded them a bit of late. Over the weekend in Miami they didn\xe2\x80\x99t hit nary one home run. Granted that might not necessarily be a fair comparison given that Marlins Park is so pitcher-friendly. However we saw what a difference it made as the O\xe2\x80\x99s dropped two-of-three.oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dCurt Schilling Continues to be an EmbarrassmentMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday1 d - Fantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL1 d - Boston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue3d - Baltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red SoxMore News at Birds Watcher  With Delmon Young at first in the second inning, Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x98s line drive cleared the left field wall and gave the Birds a 2-0 lead. However an inning later George Springer decided that two could play at that game and cut the lead to 2-1 with a homer of his own. Chris Carter would give Houston the lead with an opposite field two-RBI single off the right field wall. Again, Carter\xe2\x80\x99s a right-handed hitter. Not only did he drive in two runs for his team by not hitting the ball to where the spray charts say he hits, but he went the opposite way.If the Orioles can start to have more dynamic at-bats like this over the course of games, they\xe2\x80\x99ll find themselves with more base runners which will ultimately equal more runs.\xc2\xa0Incidentally, you might throw a\xc2\xa0maybe in front of the part about more runs. Houston put 11 hits on the board yesterday \xe2\x80\x93 and they only netted those three runs. Credit Chen, and the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen. Baseball never ceases to give us ironies. Go figure that Buck Showalter would pick yesterday to sit Chris Davis, and that he would start Steve Pearce at first base instead. So with a runner on base in the last of the seventh, Pearce came to bat with one gone.

The ballCourtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY Sportsmade it over the wall, and suddenly the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a 4-3 lead which stood up and held thanks to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen.It\xe2\x80\x99s at-bats as such which need to be more commonplace with the O\xe2\x80\x99s if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be successful. If they\xe2\x80\x99re going to record fly ball outs, they might as well be loud fly ball outs. The fielders shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be taking nary two steps to catch the ball.

Rob Carr/Getty Images/AFP (AFP Photo/Rob Carr)More- The Baltimore Orioles will become the first US big league team to play in baseball-crazed Cuba since a diplomatic thaw, playing Havana\'s national team, a Cuban official said Tuesday. In December, US President Barack Obama and Cuba\'s Raul Castro announced a historic change of course after more than five decades of cold war. ""A clash with the Orioles is planned,"" the director of Cuba\'s National Institute of Sport, Antonio Becali said, quoted by Radio Habana Cuba. The Orioles will play ""this year against our national team but the date has not been set yet,"" he said. The Orioles first string is not expected since they will be busy with their regular season, Becali said. But he added that Cuba\'s national team was still looking forward to the clash.AFP ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles Designate Alejandro De Aza for Assignment', 'There were some that follow the Baltimore Orioles who have been clamoring for a shakeup to the current team following some of the ugliest baseball during the Buck Showalter era and a dreadful 20-23 start.You got your wish today.The Orioles have reinstated Ryan Flaherty from the 15-day disabled list. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the big news here. The shocker is that they have designated Alejandro De Aza for assignment. The Orioles made the announcement official on Twitter just after 2 p.m. today.The Orioles have reinstated INF Ryan Flaherty from the 15-day disabled list and have designated OF Alejandro De Aza for assignment.\xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) May 27, 2015It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that the move made was in the outfield. Showalter has been searching for a consistent duo to pair with Adam Jones, but no one has stepped up to take over those roles. Evidently, Showalter is tired of shuffling his players and parting with De Aza eliminates some of the clutter of players in the corner outfield.De Aza, 31, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done well in 2015 after having an impressive September for the ball club last season. He has a line of .214/.277/.359 with three homers and two stolen bases in 2015, after hitting .293/.341/.537 with three home runs in 20 games with the Orioles last season.\xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen workDe Aza was tendered arbitration over the winter, and went through the arbitration hearing against the Orioles, only to lose to the team. He still received a $5 million salary, a hefty price for the lack of production the team has received this season. That very deal will make it likely that a team will not be willing to claim him off waivers, rather waiting until he becomes a free agent.The move adds pressure to David Lough, Delmon Young and Travis Snider, hoping that one will take advantage of the situation and earn an everyday role. Steve Pearce will see additional time in the outfield now that Flaherty will return to second base. Pearce filled in admirably at second base, but Jimmy Paredes was the Orioles second baseman when they could not use the DH in Miami this past weekend.Say whatever you want about Flaherty, but he is more valuable to the Orioles than De Aza. Flaherty is batting .250/.372/.500 in a limited sample size, but his defense is his calling card. With a team that seems to have an error on a nightly basis, cleaning up the infield is a must. Flaherty is hands down a much better infielder than Pearce, Paredes and Everth Cabrera.The corresponding move should be a wake up call to the entire team because the youngsters have proven that they are ready and waiting in the minors. Recalling Steve Clevenger in place of Ryan Lavarnway was the first move made by the ball club yesterday, and De Aza might just be the second of several moves in the upcoming weeks. Kevin Gausman, Matt Wieters and Jonathan Schoop are all on the mend and should be back in Baltimore shortly. The Orioles are going to have make some interesting decisions.The team cannot be happy with Brian Matusz, and with the recent performances of Oliver Drake, Tyler Wilson and Chaz Roe, the trade rumors might start circulating again. Only problem with that is Matusz hurt his trade value with the upcoming suspension, and that can\xe2\x80\x99t make Dan Duquette happy.De Aza and Lavarnway are likely the first of many moves that surprise us over the next few weeks. Hopefully, it lights a spark in this team and brings back the play that made the Baltimore Orioles the 2014 American League East Champions.Next: Hits and Runs Hard To Come By For OriolesMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore40m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Bob Haynie: Orioles Lose To Astros\\u2026 Quietly \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' Time to start banging the pots and pans together or playing the drum kit. Maybe get the dog to start barking at four in the morning. Any kind of annoying or loud noise will do.  Because something needs to wake up the bats of the Baltimore Orioles.  Houston pitchers Scott Feldman, Pat Neshek, Chad Qualls and Luke Gregerson kept the Baltimore offense in Slumberland as the Astros beat the Orioles 4-1 on Tuesday night at Camden Yards. Houston\xe2\x80\x99s win evened the three-game series at 1-1 with the rubber game coming up on Wednesday afternoon.  Feldman, a former Oriole, was efficient in holding the Birds to four hits and one run in six innings of work. He also got the Orioles to hit into a season-high tying three double plays. All three DP\xe2\x80\x99s were of the inning-ending variety.  The Orioles have scored only four runs over their last 40 innings as May run production continues to be inconsistent. They are now 1-16 when scoring less than four runs and 0-20 when trialing after seven innings.  I know the Orioles are dealing with injuries, but there are still quality players in manager Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s lineup. They just aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting the job done, at this time.  After an outstanding April, CF Adam Jones has struggled with the bat in May. This month, the four-time All-Star is batting just .237 with a .276 OBP. Jones has not homered since May 11 and hit just one since April 19.  1B Chris Davis, who is mired in a 4-for-42 slump, is hitting an anemic .154 with a .247 OBP in May. Davis also hasn\xe2\x80\x99t homered since May 11 and has already struck out 64 times in 149 AB\xe2\x80\x99s in 2015.  The Orioles have scored 75 runs in May which places them 29th in Major League Baseball. For the month, the team is batting .228 with a .286 OBP.  I\xe2\x80\x99m not Earl Weaver, but even I know those are some poor numbers.  Thankfully, there are only a couple of days left in the month of May.

Melky Cabrera, and later Adam LaRoche would provide RBI-doubles, and the Orioles trailed 2-0. Chicago would also add a run on a force out-RBI by Tyler Flowers in the ninth, before the O\xe2\x80\x99s got it going in the last of the inning.After a two-out single by Delmon Young, Chris Davis came to the plate, and nailed a two-run homer into the stands to bring the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within 3-2. However they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t finish the job, and fell to defeat in game one. The eighth inning\xc2\xa0incidentally was marred by Manny Machado being ejected after he was called out on strikes and slammed his helmet down in disgust. That temper is one thing Machado is going to have to learn to control, lest he wants to start being judged even more harshly by umpires.Courtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe majority of these twin bills are split, but that means it\xe2\x80\x99s always tougher if you fall in the first game because that puts some pressure on in the second game.

From the get go, it was obvious Wright didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite have the stuff he had in the first two starts given that Chicago took an early 1-0 lead on Eaton\xe2\x80\x99s first inning solo homer. \xc2\xa0oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dCurt Schilling Continues to be an EmbarrassmentMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday1 d - Fantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL1 d - Boston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue3d - Baltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red SoxMore News at Birds Watcher  However Wright settled down, and kept the O\xe2\x80\x99s in a good spot to win the game. Wright\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 6 H, 3 R, 0 BB, 2 K. Wright also got a little help from his friends, and early on at that. Manny Machado hit a lead off triple which put the Birds in business. Machado would tie the score at one on Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 FC-RBI, before Davis came up for the first time in game two with Jimmy Paredes on second base. Davis hit a ground rule double, which scored Paredes and put the Orioles in the lead 2-1.However that lead was short-lived, as Adam LaRoche\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer in the third put Chicago back in the lead at 3-2. But the ChiSox had already had their moment in the sun for the day if you will. In the last of that same third inning Steve Clevenger\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single tied the game at three. However an errant throw allowed Clevenger to advance to second, and Chris Davis to third. Davis would score on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single, putting the Birds back in the lead for good.Travis Snider would give the Orioles some breathing room with an RBI-single in the last of the sixth, and one inning later David Lough\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single ran the score to 6-3 which was the final. The Orioles did have to use four relievers in that second game, however as Buck Showalter has said on numerous occasions, they just take things game-by-game.So the Orioles finished the day in the same position they began it, two games under .500 and in third place in the AL East. Going back to the Machado ejection in the first game, as I said his temper is going to be something he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to start controlling.

While it might be fair to tactfully question here and there when it comes to the strike zone, throwing the helmet as such will get you run everytime.\xc2\xa0The Orioles will welcome Tampa to town, in theory for the second time this year starting tomorrow night. As we know, the first series was moved to Tampa where the O\xe2\x80\x99s played as the home team in the wake of the riots which prompted the doubleheader today.

Apparently Buck Showalter of the Baltimore Orioles had a comment or two regarding how new Miami manager Dan Jennings manages his bullpen (quote courtesy of Clark Spencer of the Miami Herald):They used what? Three guys three days in a row out of the bullpen to get it done?\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see how that works down the road.I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest in that I was a bit surprised to see Showalter say that about a fellow manager. Now granted, Jennings probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of as a \xe2\x80\x9cfellow manager\xe2\x80\x9d quite yet by the people who are now his peers.I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go so far as to say that Showalter shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made those comments, especially given the fact that Jennings had the audacity to call out reliever Brian Matusz for something that his own players presumably do as well. But needless to say, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen Showalter call out another manager like that.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerBut\xc2\xa0this is not to say that Showalter was incorrect in his assessment. Managers have to think ahead in terms of how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to utilize their bullpen. How often do we see Showalter saying after a game that a certain reliever (or even position player) wasn\xe2\x80\x99t available that day?In fairness Jennings is new to the manager game, so this might be something that he\xe2\x80\x99ll learn. But keep in mind that a few of Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s predecessors managed to burn through their bullpens over the years, which certainly added to the records of those teams.Incidentally, Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s not the only manager questioning Jennings. Arizona manager Chip Hale had a few comments as well in a radio interview with former MLB general manager Jim Bowden (courtesy of Clark Spencer of the Miami Herald):Courtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsI\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before: When you finish playing or get into Major League Baseball on the minor-league level, you say, \xe2\x80\x98OK, what do I want to do? OK, I want to manage in the big leagues. What do I have to do? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to bust my hump coaching and teaching and become the best manager at the minor-league level that I can, then get to the big leagues.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s not looking like that track is going to be the way anymore.If anything, that comes across as bitterness on the part of Hale, and quite frankly that\xe2\x80\x99s something that I can indirectly understand. Let\xe2\x80\x99s keep in mind that Jennings is still the de facto GM of the Miami Marlins.So he in effect hired himself to be the field manager as well. In a way, it comes off as circumventing the system. While every situation is different, guys who paid their dues tend to not look kindly on someone who seemingly waltzes through the door and is suddenly on the same level as they are \xe2\x80\x93 and that goes for any industry.\xc2\xa0oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dCurt Schilling Continues to be an EmbarrassmentMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday1 d - Fantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL1 d - Boston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue3d - Baltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red SoxMore News at Birds Watcher  Mind you, this is totally different than what Buck Showalter said. However it does illustrate the fact that Jennings made a leap for which he might not have been properly prepared when he decided to go into the dugout.Some folks might look at Showalter and suggest that he\xe2\x80\x99s bitter at being Jennings\xe2\x80\x99 first win(s); however Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s not the type of guy to worry about something like that. The point is that a guy who had managed in the past probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be burning through his bullpen at that rate. Which of course leads very nicely into Hale\xe2\x80\x99s comments.Again in fairness, Jennings might well end up being the greatest manager of all time. We see coaches in the NFL who are the team\xe2\x80\x99s GM quite frequently.However those are generally career coaches who have enough gravitas to get the title of GM as well \xe2\x80\x93 and they generally do have some business training, perhaps in college. Jennings\xe2\x80\x99 situation is all but the opposite of that.It\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see what happens as the season goes on in Miami, however needless to say a few of his counterparts have their eyebrows raised.Next: Baltimore Orioles recall Clevenger; Matusz appear still pending "", 'birdswatcher.com')]"

05/30/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Walk It Off Behind Davis, Gonzalez', 'May 29, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Miguel Gonzalez (50) pitches during the first inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles, despite being just one game under .500, find themselves tied for second in the AL East after a thrilling 2-1 win Friday night.Well, that was fun.Miguel Gonzalez made one mistake on Friday night, a solo home run by Steven Souza Jr. \xc2\xa0The rest of the night, he was on point. \xc2\xa08 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 0 BB, 6 SO. That is a really good outing.No matter that the Rays have an offense as good as my high school baseball team, which admittedly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very good. The Rays\xe2\x80\x99 offense is in shambles. But, they are a major league team, and a win is a win. And man, do they have some fantastic starting pitching.The Orioles could do nothing against Rays\xe2\x80\x99 starter Nathan Karns.\xc2\xa0 But, once he was out of the game, Chris Davis quickly tied the game by hitting a big fly to the flag court over the scoreboard.The ninth inning got a little hairy.\xc2\xa0 Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day loaded the bases with no, count \xe2\x80\x99em, no outs. But two strikeouts and a ground ball later and the offense went to work.

Travis Snider singled, and then Everth Cabrera pinch ran for him. He moved to third on a ball down the line by Chris Davis, to bring up J.J. Hardy.And J.J. came through, slashing a single past one of the best third basemen in the game, Evan Longoria.To think, less than a week ago I was calling for changes to be made to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 roster here. But, I think that might be part of the resurgence.\xc2\xa0 The Orioles made those moves.I thought that Steve Clevenger should be called up for Ryan Lavarnway. That happened. Lavarnway is gone, opting to become a free agent.\xc2\xa0 What the Orioles do in a week when Matt Wieters comes back with Clevenger is a mystery, as he will likely be sent down.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore40m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d agoThen, Alejandro De Aza was designated for assignment.\xc2\xa0 This was a move that was a bigger move. It showed that what the Orioles have been doing, particularly the play in the outfield, is not good enough.Since, David Lough has received more playing time. And has been getting hits, and making plays in the outfield that other players would not make.I thought that Nolan Reimold should be called up, and I think that is going to happen soon. Three of the four moves I thought should be made.The last one was for Mike Wright to stay in the rotation and Bud Norris to be sent to the bullpen.\xc2\xa0 I think this is still going to happen as well. Bud is still not pitching well in the minors. He only has one more start left in the minors before he will return to the team.\xc2\xa0 But, with Wright pitching well and Norris struggling against minor league competition, I think Bud needs to go in the bullpen.The Orioles have shown they aren\xe2\x80\x99t afraid to make moves, and now they are making moves up toward the top of the AL East.

His 10 home runs are tops among AL rookies and twice that of any teammate.David DeJesus also homered and Joey Butler had a career-high four hits for the Rays, who took two of three for their first series win in five tries since mid-May.Odorizzi (4-5) came in with a 2.31 ERA but had lost three straight starts due primarily to lack of offensive backing. The Rays have tallied six runs in his five losses, and their output Sunday was more than in his previous four starts combined.Odorizzi allowed four runs and seven hits in six-plus innings. The right-hander yielded three home runs \xe2\x80\x94 one more than in his previous 10 starts.""It wasn\'t my best outing,"" Odorizzi said. ""It\'s odd, I think that\'s the most runs I\'ve given up all year and get a win for it.

""That was good to see against one of the better pitchers in the league.""Tillman gave up five earned runs and nine hits in his career-high sixth straight defeat. Each of the three batters he walked came around to score.""I am making some good pitches, but not enough,"" Tillman said. ""When I\'m falling behind, I\'m not making that quality pitch to get out of it. It\'s frustrating.""It was 2-all in the fifth when Tillman walked Evan Longoria after opening the inning with two strikeouts. DeJesus followed with an infield hit and Logan Forsythe singled in a run before Souza ripped a 3-2 pitch over the center-field wall.""Logan put together a good at bat before me, which kind of took the wind out of (Tillman\'s) sails,"" Souza said.DeJesus connected off Oliver Drake in the seventh, and Machado chased Odorizzi with a two-run drive in the bottom half.Odorizzi has gone at least six innings in 11 straight starts, tied for second place in the team record book behind James Shields (14).After Young put the Orioles ahead in the first inning with his first homer of the season, Tampa Bay took the lead in the second.Young connected again in the third to knot the score at 2. It was his fourth career multihomer game, the first since August 2011 with Minnesota.The Rays collected three singles, two doubles and a pair of walks in the first four innings but went 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position.All that changed in the fifth, and Tampa Bay cruised to the finish.""We didn\'t capitalize on some opportunities,"" manager Kevin Cash said, ""but then Souza comes up with a huge hit to give us a little separation.""ON STRIKERays: OF Kevin Kiermaier struck out four consecutive times before hitting a double in the eighth inning.Orioles: DH Jimmy Paredes struck out twice and is 1 for 20 with 11 Ks in his last five games.TRAINER\'S ROOMRays: 2B Gordon Beckham was placed on the 15-day DL.

06/01/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Month of May Ends on Sour Note', 'The Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching had a team ERA of 3.94 in the month of May, but the offense failed to support their efforts. Chris Tillman (30) gave up six runs in the O\xe2\x80\x99s final game of the month. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offensive struggles continued early on in their 9-5 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays Sunday afternoon. However, they did end the game with four home runs.Delmon Young began the game 2-for-2 with a home run against the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 starting pitcher Jake Odorizzi. He seemed to give fans a sign of hope by hitting a solo home run in the first inning, but even with a second home run in the third inning, the offense did not rally behind him.One or two players cannot bring the offense out of a rut, but a series of connecting hits can bring some life to the batters. They started to do that in the late innings, but the pitching allowed add-on runs in the seventh, eighth and ninth innings.

The problem the Orioles have is being able to combine good hitting with good pitching.The O\xe2\x80\x99s reached the magic number of four runs, which is when most MLB teams win a game. However, Chris Tillman could not hold down the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 offense. Baltimore cannot put the offense and defense on the same page, let alone the same game.Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game allowed only three runs, but the offense didn\xe2\x80\x99t show up. They will always have dry periods of no offense or poor pitching, but what makes them a formidable opponent is being able to work as a team when one aspect shows up. When the pitching does well, the offense needs to be able to help.The Orioles were second between both leagues in team batting average in April, but were near the bottom in team ERA. They finished with a 10-10 record averaging 5.6 runs per game, while allowing 5.2 runs per game.Even though the pitching gave up more than five runs per game, the offense outscored opponents 112-104. However, the numbers are distorted by an 18-7 victory over the Boston Red Sox. Without that game, opponents outscored the Orioles 94-97, while the O\xe2\x80\x99s scored only 4.7 runs a game. When only one part of the team does well, the result is a .500 or below team.Even when clearing the numbers up, the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 offense scored on average the magic number of four, despite the pitching giving up near the same amount. This reason is why the month was finished at .500. When only one part of the team does well, the result is a .500 or below team.At the end of May, the O\xe2\x80\x99s finished with a record of 13-16. And as I said, if only one part of the team is working, the result is a .500 or below team. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching held an ERA of 3.38, but the offense averaged 3.2 runs per game.The Birds were outscored 104-95 in the month. The pitching improved from April, but the offense disappeared leaving the pitchers to try to win games on their own.The O\xe2\x80\x99s held opponents below four runs 13 times in May, but only won seven of those games. The Orioles were also shutout three times during the month for a total of four on the season.The month of April showed the pitching to be absent, and May brought a lack of hitting. If I spot a trend, the offense and pitching could be on track to be on the same page in June.Chris Davis has shown some life with his bat of recent, and Machado could finally be coming out of his slump. With Matt Wieters returning on Friday, if he can start on the right offensive foot, he could help jolt the offense.The one thing the Orioles can hold onto is that the rest of the American League East is not doing any better. The Toronto Blue Jays are the only team with an even record in their last 10 games, and they are six games below .500.The Rays and New York Yankees are the only teams above .500, and they are only above by one game.

Buck Showalter uses it with the Baltimore Orioles, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that anyone does it as often as teams such as Tampa and Houston. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, but it just comes off as non-traditional to me.And the fact is that the shift, while thought to be a modern invention, is fairly old. It was used as far back as the 1920\xe2\x80\x99s against Cy Williams, and then again against Ted Williams later on. However I would submit that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really become a \xe2\x80\x9cthing\xe2\x80\x9d until Joe Maddon started using it in the late 2000\xe2\x80\x99s with Tampa.

In effect, I think that thegame should shake down naturally as opposed to being forced. And there are times when I would submit that the game comes off as somewhat forced when there\xe2\x80\x99s almost a shift put on for each batter. That\xe2\x80\x99s not an \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d but it\xe2\x80\x99s just my view.Every hitter has a spray chart, which shows where they generally hit the ball. Mind you, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s spray chart is going to show them not focusing on one main area of the field. Granted some hitters cover the field in full better than others, however nobody has the entire area \xe2\x80\x9ccovered\xe2\x80\x9d in full. However by employing the shift, teams are all but ensuring that hitters will record outs if they hit the ball to their specialized area. Is that not in effect removing offense from the game?\xc2\xa0oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dCurt Schilling Continues to be an EmbarrassmentMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday1 d - Fantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL1 d - Boston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue3d - Baltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red SoxMore News at Birds Watcher  Believe me, I\xe2\x80\x99m not one of these people who thinks defense shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a part of the game.

There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason bunts can\xe2\x80\x99t start going down more often to combat the shift (and I\xe2\x80\x99m talking league-wide here, not just about the Orioles) and so forth.However again, I would submit that these shifts are all but removing offense from the games. And when that starts to happen, games can get really boring really quickly from the perspective of casual fans. And by the way, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in favor of banning shifts either. I know that might sound strange after saying all of this, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t legislate ill parts of the game out at the snap of a finger. What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that I wish more managers would try to simply record outs by pitching as opposed to circumventing things.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Buck Showalter All-Time Team "", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters to Return This Week', 'I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit, I am kind of at a loss for what to write about regarding the Orioles.Some topics that came to mind were the fact that maybe this team is only average, but fellow writer Randy Buchman already covered that\xc2\xa0here.Then I thought about again expressing the reasoning that Nolan Reimold should be promoted, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve covered that numerous times as well.The thought of Adam Jones missing a second consecutive day is topic-worthy, but it is a mild ankle sprain and he tried to talk himself into the game today. I anticipate Jones being back in CF on Monday in Houston.That led me to consider the need for David Lough on the team, someone I recently advocated for giving more playing time too.But, in the spirit of optimism, which is tough to find in heavy doses right now when it comes to the Birds, I want to look ahead to the return of Matt Wieters.Wieters is eligible to come off the disabled list on June 4, and all signs point to him coming off on June 5 and playing for the Orioles that evening.\xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen workAt this point, Matt is catching every other day, and that likely will continue with the Orioles for at least the first few weeks.\xc2\xa0 That means Caleb Joseph will likely still see several starts a week, and Wieters may be able to DH.\xc2\xa0 However, that leaves the concern that if Joseph has to come out of the game, the Orioles could lose their DH.With the current roster crunch, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how Steve Clevenger could stay with the team. While he was the only player hitting on Saturday, and his bat is certainly worth keeping, there just isn\xe2\x80\x99t any room to keep him.But, back to Wieters. Last year, when Matt got hurt he was hitting .308 with 5 HRs, 19 RBIs, 5 2B, and 13 runs scored. Many people like to give Nelson Cruz credit for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense during April 2014, but Wieters was carrying a big stick.Wieters also has a reputation of being one of the best behind the plate as well.\xc2\xa0 Both in throwing out runners and also calling a game, Wieters is considered by many to be one of the best.The Orioles have been lucky to have someone as skilled as Caleb Joseph replace Wieters while he was out. And I will admit, even at times Joseph has shown he may have more ability than Wieters.\xc2\xa0 But those times are often brief stints. Joseph can\xe2\x80\x99t maintain the same success over a season that Matt Wieters can, especially not as a hitter.If Wieters can come back fully healthy and contribute, it will be a big help to this team that is struggling for offense. It might even take some pressure off guys like Adam Jones and Jimmy Paredes, who started so hot but have since reverted back to their typical \xe2\x80\x98form,\xe2\x80\x99 and who both have been swinging at a lot of pitches outside the strike zone.Maybe the return of Matt Wieters will be just what this team needs to get it over the .500 hump.Next: Month of May Ends on Sour Note for Orioles ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the oldest adages in baseball, and one that Buck Showalter has often used with the Baltimore Orioles. And baseball\xe2\x80\x99s the only sport where this can apply given the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s the only one where you play everyday.The idea of course is that after a loss you have to try to put it behind you and move onto the next game. However the same is also true after a win. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t put it behind you and move on, you mind find yourself in an inflated sense of euphoria, which can lead to an inflated sense of value. When you start to go too far in that direction, you leave yourself vulnerable to being let down.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerCourtesy of Adam Hunger-USA TODAY SportsLet\xe2\x80\x99s assume of course that putting a loss behind you is the right thing to do. The last thing anyone wants to do is be counter-productive and dwell on losses. But if you put a win behind you, are you in effect doing something counter-productive? Could one not argue that you\xe2\x80\x99re potentially blocking mental momentum?I suppose it matters what\xe2\x80\x99s causing momentum in the first place. I\xe2\x80\x99m not an athlete, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what exactly it means to \xe2\x80\x9cput a game behind you.\xe2\x80\x9d However needless to say, it\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting point. The Orioles come to the park each day focusing on \xe2\x80\x9ctoday\xe2\x80\x99s game,\xe2\x80\x9d and today\xe2\x80\x99s game only. So if where as many fans argue that this team can\xe2\x80\x99t string together multiple victories in a row, is it potentially a mental thing?Perhaps the point here is that taking both good and ill things \xe2\x80\x9cwith you\xe2\x80\x9d can be mutually exclusive. If a pitcher gets rocked in a game, he can try to put that behind him in his next outing. However if he pitches well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why he can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9ctake that with him\xe2\x80\x9d into his next outing.So if in fact the O\xe2\x80\x99s are literally going game-by-game as they say, perhaps they\xe2\x80\x99re leaving a lot of potential on the table. You also can\xe2\x80\x99t discount the fact that not only are the O\xe2\x80\x99s not at full strength, but that there\xe2\x80\x99s more parity in the league than there\xe2\x80\x99s been in years.

Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsAt varied times in recent years, I find myself feeling both overly optimistic about the Baltimore Orioles and overly pessimistic. And I try to not have those ups and downs coincide exactly with the wins and losses on the schedule.I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in either of those states of mind. The desire is to be reasonably objective. But the inner fan gets in the way for all of us, causing either blindness to glaring faults out of love run amuck, or relentless criticism of insignificant blips of failure out of fear that the little lump will metathesize into inoperable cancer.\xc2\xa0To say this squad would not win even 81 games seemed preposterous to Orioles fans in the offseasonI was among those who wrote critically of the abundance of national baseball prognosticators who called for the Orioles to have a sub-.500 season this year. After 96 wins in 2014, even with a few pieces not re-signed, there was an entire rotation returning and plenty of the power and muscle that made last year happen. To say this squad would not win even 81 games seemed preposterous to Orioles fans in the offseason.Do those writers seem quite so stupid at this point?\xc2\xa0 The Orioles are at 23-27.Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s early. But that excuse is starting to get late. And yes, the rest of the AL East is not much better off, if not completely worse. But folks, 50 games is more than a small sample; and frankly, my standard for the Baltimore Orioles is not based in any one-to-one comparison with any other team in the AL East!\xc2\xa0 Really? We should want to be compared to those outfits and the way they have each done business in recent years? In the spirit of Dr. Seuss, they are Joke 1, Joke 2, Joke 3, and Joke 4. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen workSo where is some optimism around here?Well, can you believe this?\xc2\xa0 The starting point for such is the starting pitching. That used to be the #1 whipping boy for the Orioles. Ubaldo Jimenez has been really good, along with Miguel Gonzalez. Wei-Yin Chen battles well to keep the O\xe2\x80\x99s in games. I am guessing that Mike Wright will continue to learn quickly on the job and be effective enough to not be removable. Who knows what is wrong with Chris Tillman, but you would hope that he of all people would be the most likely to figure it out and fix things before too long. Kevin Gausman should contribute again this year. However, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve written several times, I see no future for Bud Norris this season. Too much has happened, and that is unfortunate for a guy I love as a great competitor.The bullpen is reasonably solid, certainly in the top third of pens in MLB. Zach Britton is a legit closer, and unless you\xe2\x80\x99ve followed my writing for a long time, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how rare it is for me to write that \xe2\x80\x93 not generally believing in \xe2\x80\x9cdesignated closers\xe2\x80\x9d unless you have a fairly rare talent. Some of the relievers are going to blow a game here and there, as Brad Brach did last night. This seems like a more glaring problem than it is, since the O\xe2\x80\x99s simply do not score many runs on too many occasions.And therein is the problem \xe2\x80\x93 not scoring runs. The Orioles have scored two or fewer in 19 of the 50 games played so far this year \xe2\x80\xa6 winning only one of them. So, in order to have a winning percentage equal to 2014 (.593), the Orioles would have to have won 28 of the 31 games in which they scored three or more runs!\xc2\xa0 That is a huge expectation. That they are 22-9 when scoring three or more is truthfully quite a good statistic.But where is the optimism for scoring more runs? Let me look around for it.Okay\xe2\x80\xa6 here is what I found: Delmon Young is hitting much better, as is Chris Davis. We know that Adam Jones goes through ups and downs, and he has had one of each this year \xe2\x80\x93 time for a new up. Manny Machado is not going to totally flame out, so he won\xe2\x80\x99t be worse than he is right now and will likely be better \xe2\x80\x93 just wish it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in leadoff. Jimmy Paredes was due for a downturn, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll contribute again. Matt Wieters gives the O\xe2\x80\x99s a chance for more from the catcher position \xe2\x80\xa6 a chance.I can\xe2\x80\x99t point to much else, sorry. Travis Snider is my best hope for the rest of the gang currently in Baltimore. Caleb Joseph is about adequate. I think if Steve Pearce and David Lough were going to find it, they would have found it by now. I never thought the Everth Cabrera acquisition was that great, but, with injuries past and future, the Orioles need him around. I\xe2\x80\x99m infamous (or something like that) for having zero confidence in Ryan Flaherty. And how much of an offensive hole does J.J. Hardy leave behind if he ends up on the DL? Well, .190/.209/.274 to be exact. Ugh.It will take more than a couple of these characters to light up to bring the Orioles to the top of the AL East through the end of the season. But it really could happen. This is not the 2010 or 2011 Orioles.

Nothing could be further from the truth; like the Birds, every other team in the division has been incredibly inconsistent. While it would help the Orioles to take command of things and get ahead of some of these teams, the fact is that they\xe2\x80\x99ve just begun to fight.Unfortunately I find myself consistently eating my words this year, as I\xe2\x80\x99m seemingly proven wrong on a nightly basis. In fact, it seems that the only things I\xe2\x80\x9dm saying correctly are my predictions about the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 opponents. For so long I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the O\xe2\x80\x99s will go as far as their starting pitching will take them. Their starting pitching has been stellar; but they\xe2\x80\x99re struggling. Instead I tweeted several times last night that Houston scores 40% of their runs in the seventh inning or later. Low and behold\xe2\x80\xa6More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal2/17 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Johnson wants to revitalize his career\xe2\x80\xa6but before we get to that I should mention how good Ubaldo Jimenez was last night. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 2 BB, 8 K. Jimenez was throwing first-pitch strikes and getting ahead in the count right off the bat. He fooled Houston hitters nearly his entire start, which is the narrative he\xe2\x80\x99s followed mainly all season.Offensively the Orioles had their chances, yet anything that could go wrong seemed to go south quickly. David Lough got picked off first base with nobody out and Adam Jones at the plate in the fourth, which ran the O\xe2\x80\x99s right out of a potential scoring chance. However they were able to break through in the fifth when Ryan Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-triple gave the Birds a 1-0 lead. However Houston then turned to the\xc2\xa0anything you can do I can do better mode, and tied the game in the last of the inning on Luis Valbuena\xe2\x80\x99s solo homer.Following an Adam Jones walk and a Delmon Young single in the sixth, Chris Davis nearly homered over the right field wall \xe2\x80\x93 but the ball hit the top of the wall and bounced back into the field of play. With the configuration of the park, it stood to reason that both runners might score on a ball to that area. However Davis hit the ball so hard that only Jones could score. While that gave the Birds a 2-1 lead, it also shows how this can be a game of inches. A few inches higher and that\xe2\x80\x99s a three-run homer. If it\xe2\x80\x99s hit just a bit softer, it\xe2\x80\x99s a two-RBI double.Steve Pearce and Caleb Joseph would record two quick outs to end the inning, however the O\xe2\x80\x99s blew a shot at a bigger inning with two runners in scoring position. And again, Houston makes a habbit of scoring lots of runs (40% of their total runs scored) in the seventh inning of later. Two runs just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to cut it for the Birds.Live Feed ubaldo jimenezBaltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Fun facts as the first trip to Yankee Stadium gets underway The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles Clicking on All Cylinders The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: What to Make of Recent Stellar Starts by Jimenez, Miley The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: What's next for Ubaldo Jim\xc3\xa9nez? The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Cincinnati Reds: 3 things to keep an eye on The Baltimore WireCourtesy of Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsChris Carter singled to lead off the seventh for Houston, which brought Buck Showalter onto the field to lift Jimenez. In retrospect, jimenez might have had a bit left in the tank \xe2\x80\x93 his body langauge as he walked off the field seemed to indicate that he did. However Showalter lifted Jimenez at 91 pitches so as to protect him from himself. A guy who pitched as dominantly as he had deserved the dignity of not being allowed to lose the game.Furthermore Brad Brach had been strong for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Of course in the back of your head you had to think\xc2\xa0so that means at a certain point he\xe2\x80\x99s due a poor outing, right? And those poor outings generally hit when they\xe2\x80\x99re needed least. Brach started Luis Valbuena off with a walk, and Hank Conger loaded the bases with a single. George Springer\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single tied the game at two, and Houston took the lead on Jose Altuve\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI.Evan Gattis\xe2\x80\x99 two-RBI single ran the score to 5-2, which of course was the final. Again, hindsight is 20/20. It\xe2\x80\x99s so easy to say that Showalter shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have lifted Jimenez when he did. However that\xe2\x80\x99s being said with the benefit of knowing the result. That aside, let\xe2\x80\x99s not kid ourselves into thinking that Houston\xc2\xa0wanted\xc2\xa0this game more than the Orioles, or that they were hungrier. That\xe2\x80\x99s an easy trap to fall into, and again in saying things as such we also have the benefit of knowing the results.Houston knows the stats as well as I do; they\xe2\x80\x99re well aware of the fact that they score a lot of runs in the later innings. Heck, Buck Showalter knows it as well; which is probably part of the reason he lifted Jimenez. But there\xe2\x80\x99s an aura around this Houston team whereby they seem to sit back and let the opponent manuever their way out of games. So while their opponents (the Orioles in this case) are wheeling and dealing in an attempt to stop them from late-game heroics, they\xe2\x80\x99re just playing. Interesting to say the least.Adam Jones returned to the lineup as the DH last night, in hopes that he can be back in the field this evening. However the Orioles were without the services of J.J. Hardy, who apparently had some pain in his side that concerned Showalter. So once again the Birds weren\xe2\x80\x99t at full strength at the plate. The series will continue this evening with Mike Wright on the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Collin McHugh, with game time being set for just after 8 PM.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Are Infield Shifts Hurting Baseball?More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Mandatory Credit: Thomas B. Shea-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are facing frustration at every turn, losing to the Astros on Tuesday night by a score of 6-4, while blowing a 4-0 early lead. They drop to 23-28 on the season.The O\xe2\x80\x99s finally put together some good at-bats and hit around in the second inning, scoring four runs. But they would only put two more men on base for the entire seven innings that followed.Meanwhile, Houston had their own big inning with five runs in the third frame, while adding an insurance run in the eighth.There is plenty of frustration on the field. It looked like maybe the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 luck was changing as Jimmy Paredes got a cheap base hit off the end of the bat to get it going in the four-run second inning. Much of the year it has seemed like the O\xe2\x80\x99s hit balls hard at people, while the opposition gets \xe2\x80\x9cseeing-eye\xe2\x80\x9d grounders through the middle and Texas League pops that fall in.

Evan Gattis hit a crippling three-run shot to tie, followed by Luis Valbuena with a solo shot to give the Astros the 5-4 lead. For each, it was the 12th homer of the season.Off the field, the frustration continues with injuries and a non-flexible roster. Jonathan Schoop sounds to be gone for a long time, while J.J. Hardy is awaiting word on an MRI related to a possible oblique issue.If Hardy goes down and out for a time, it would appear that Paul Janish will need to be called up. He is a plus defender, but not much of a hitter \xe2\x80\xa6 though neither has Hardy been this year.Several of the Norfolk Tides hitters are performing well at this point, particularly Nolan Reimold. But the issue is how to bring him or any of the others up without losing a player like David Lough. If only they could interchange some parts.Also hitting well right now is Henry Urrutia, surprisingly doing so from the leadoff spot. Chris Parmelee has been solid all year.

Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsIt seems like I was a much younger man the last time I wrote about an O\xe2\x80\x99s win. But finally the Baltimore Orioles gained a victory in Houston, even if it was by the crushing score of 3-2.One game, one win does not make for a trend or streak. But there are a number of features about this series finale victory that can be received as encouraging. It was a win that was gained by veteran players.And not just the players, the manager also. Buck Showalter got himself thrown out of the game in the second inning. Well, amen to that! In old-time baseball, when a team was going poorly, managers like Earl Weaver and Billy Martin would kick up a fuss and get themselves tossed to stir up their squad. Beyond that, he had a legit gripe about the huge strike zone that got Ryan Flaherty unjustly called out.As I wrote yesterday, the lack of plate discipline and the overly-aggressive posture of Orioles hitters did not serve them well at all. The Orioles registered six outs Wednesday evening by hitting the first pitch, and they also were 1-for-5 when swinging at 1-0 and 2-0 pitches. The fact that they were taking pitches early in the game on Thursday, along with Showalter flipping out about one of his players being unjustly punished for doing so, would seem to be evidence that something has been said behind closed doors on this subject. Perhaps Buck had a ranting session with the team; we\xe2\x80\x99ll never know \xe2\x80\xa6 but I hope it happened.The Orioles only managed three runs, which is certainly not an exit from the desert of scoreless-ness. And they were facing one of the best in the business. But the way these runs were registered speaks well of the effort and of who made it happen.

A good start by Wei-Yin Chen, including some clutch pitching, got the Orioles into a position of being able to win a close game. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day pitched out of a terrible jam in the seventh inning, and Zach Britton came on to register a five-out save.

(AP Photo/Tony Dejak)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECLEVELAND (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 A late afternoon start combined with the Orioles\' inability to string some hits together off Danny Salazar made for a very frustrating day for Buck Showalter.Salazar struck out 10 over seven-plus innings Saturday in powering the Cleveland Indians to a 2-1 victory over Baltimore.Third baseman Manny Machado accounted for the Orioles\' lone run on a third-inning homer, which was one of their six hits on the day off Salazar (6-1) and relievers Bryan Shaw and Cody Allen.""With a 4 o\'clock start, you only have about three innings to see the ball well at the plate,"" Showalter said. ""So, because of the shadows and the wind, you come in knowing runs would be at a minimum, then you add in Salazar, who is a quality pitcher.""We all understand (the game time) is about money, but it makes it tough,"" Showalter added.A crowd of 24,939 was on hand for Corey Kluber Bobblehead Day, marking the Indians\' fourth-largest attendance of the season.Those fans went home happy after Baltimore reliever Brad Brach (3-2) allowed a two-out double to Carlos Santana in the sixth, which broke a 1-all tie and plated Jason Kipnis.Machado had two hits and was the only member of the Orioles to advance past second base.""Salazar had his fastball and his off-speed working, so he kept us off-balance,"" Machado said. ""It also was tough to see with the shadows.""Baltimore right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez went five innings, allowing one run and six hits with a career high-tying six walks. He struck out five and stranded nine runners, but said the 19 mph wind and 61 degree temperature made it difficult to command pitches.""It was really like the ball had baby powder on it because of the weather,"" Jimenez explained. ""I found a way to battle and grind out five innings, but it was so dry. I tried to go to my mouth a lot, but by the time I started my windup, (the grip) was already gone.""Matt Wieters was in the Orioles\' lineup for the second straight day after returning from reconstructive right elbow surgery. The All-Star catcher, who was 2 for 3 with two RBIs Friday, played designated hitter and went 1 for 4.Brach threw a season-high 2 1-3 innings before left-hander Cesar Cabral picked up the final two outs. Cabral became the 997th player to appear in a game with the franchise since it moved to Baltimore in 1954.FAMOUS FACESSan Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and wide receiver Torrey Smith visited with Orioles OF Adam Jones at the ballpark. Both players were in Cleveland for Browns cornerback Joe Haden\'s celebrity softball game. ""The thing you don\'t realize about NFL or NBA players is how big they are in person,"" Showalter said.

Look at yesterday as an example; Danny Salazar is an average pitcher for the most part \xe2\x80\x93 he has a 3.79 ERA for this season. His stuff was very good yesterday without a doubt.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThere will be some who will argue that it\xe2\x80\x99s 100% on the Orioles. And it may well be. To say the least, it\xe2\x80\x99s partially on them. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this previously, however the Oriole hitters can be very \xe2\x80\x9cun-dynamic\xe2\x80\x9d at times in terms of where they hit the ball. Ironically we saw Adam Jones with a double to right field yesterday, and Chris Davis with a bunt attempt.But when hitters hit the ball to such specific points on the field, it allows teams to shift their defense to accomodate that. So a pitcher can get away with a bad pitch here or there and not have to worry too much. It also allows him to throw more and more pitches out of the zone so as to fool hitters. In effect, if you swing at balls they\xe2\x80\x99re going to throw you balls.But we\xe2\x80\x99d be remiss if we said that in some cases the O\xe2\x80\x99s haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone up against guys pitching the games of their lives. That was true a couple of times in Houston, and it was true yesterday. As Buck Showalter often says,\xc2\xa0sometimes you just have to tip your cap.

They also own the 68th pick which is in the second round which will also be made tonight.The ball club has used their first-round pick on a pitcher in three of the last five years. The most recent first-round draftee was Hunter Harvey, while the Orioles also selected Dylan Bundy and Kevin Gausman in back-to-back drafts with the fourth overall selection. The Orioles did not draft in the first or second round last season after signing qualifying offer free-agents Ubaldo Jimenez and Cruz.The Arizona Diamondbacks hold the first selection in this year\xe2\x80\x99s draft and are expected to take Vanderbilt shortstop Dansby Swanson. David Rawnsley of SI.com released his mock draft this morning and has the Orioles selecting catcher Chris Betts of Wilson High School in Long Beach, California with the 25th pick and middle infielder Scott Kingery of the University of Arizona with the final pick of the first round.

A first-round pick in a NFL or NBA draft is expected to contribute immediately. Draft picks in baseball spend a few years in the minors seasoning before they make a contribution at the professional level. While the Orioles have had recent success with their draft choices, it also certainly possible that the player never reaches the MLB. For many in the front office, this is their moment to shine.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really exciting for us because we really have the opportunity to make an impact on the organization this year,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles scouting director Gary Rajsich said.Rajsich has said that this year\xe2\x80\x99s class has a lot of high school talent.

The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles could be interested in bringing back Matt Wieters The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles reportedly in contact with outfielder Jose Bautista The Baltimore WireThere are two theories on drafting; one is that you take the best player available at the time you\xe2\x80\x99re on the clock. The other is that you go into it with a specific need that needs to be remedied. However both of those are tougher sells in baseball because unlike the NFL or NBA, players aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily impacting the team right away. What you\xe2\x80\x99re really doing with the draft is re-stocking your minor league system.But that said, I\xe2\x80\x99m more a fan of having a specific need in mind and sticking with that. If you look at the Orioles right now, pitching seems to be ruling the day both at the big league level and in the minors. Again if you looked at Melewski\xe2\x80\x99s article, you\xe2\x80\x99d know that the guys that are expecting to be the best on the board at the time the O\xe2\x80\x99s will be picking are apparently going to be pitchers.So what do the Orioles do? Pitching? Defense? Hitting? I would submit that given the fact that the organization seems to be in decent shape when it comes to pitching in the near future, maybe the Birds should consider focusing on a potential power-hitter or two. If they could find one that was a corner outfielder, that would be even better.Whomever is drafted tonight will probably end up in the Gulf Coast League, Aberdeen, or perhaps even Delmarva or Frederick if they\xe2\x80\x99re lucky (presuming they sign).

He picked up the win on Tuesday night in his eighth game for the Orioles. He has now given up just one run in 12 innings on six hits, while walking four and hitting one batter (maybe he hit him \xe2\x80\x93 did not look like it on replay).So who is this Chaz Roe guy?That is a question I asked during spring training, back in an article on March 23rd.

After another decent AAA season, he was purchased by the Yankees and appeared in three late-season games for them. One of those games was against the Orioles, where Alejandro De Aza hit a triple off him.Finally, in the past offseason, he was claimed off waivers by the Pirates, but later granted free agency in December.

Adam Jones fielded it with his bare hand and gunned a throw that took one hop right to J.J. Hardy, who had the glove low for the tag on Bogaerts.The second base umpire originally ruled Bogaerts safe, which didn\xe2\x80\x99t look to be the case in real-time.\xc2\xa0 And when Buck Showalter asked for a replay, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t take long to get the call overturned. You have to wonder if the umpire was a bit surprised that the throw was in time.Next up was Pablo Sandoval. Sandoval did a great job of dumping a good pitch past third base and toward the wall in foul territory in left field. Travis Snider, in left field, fielded the ball, spun around and fired to Ryan Flaherty, who put down the tag for the second out.Another great play by the team that leads the league in outfield assists.Mookie Betts came up and hit a ball toward the gap. But the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Gold Glove center fielder ran that one down and made a running, leaping catch in the gap. Three balls that normally would be hits, instead were outs.The Orioles would go on to score in the bottom of the second inning, and never look back.But Jonesy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done. Adam made a diving, flat-out catch in the gap to again rob Betts in the top of the fifth inning.The Baltimore Orioles have always prided themselves on defense. With Adam Jones, J.J.

The Orioles have won six of seven while posting a 2.32 ERA.Adam Jones homered for the fourth time in seven games and went 2 for 3 to boost his average to .419 in his last eight.""Getting this little roll on, playing good baseball, it\'s just the main thing as long as you get in a little groove,"" said Manny Machado, who also homered and is 9 for his last 21. ""It\'s a long season ahead of us, but hopefully we keep riding this wave.""The Orioles have also won nine of the last 12 meetings with the Yankees in Baltimore.New York (33-26) saw its seven-game winning streak come to an end in Wednesday\'s 5-4, 11-inning loss to Washington.The Yankees also lost closer Andrew Miller - perfect in 17 save chances - to a left forearm strain. He won\'t throw for 10 days to two weeks, and Dellin Betances will move into the ninth-inning role a game after the bullpen allowed a 4-2 lead to slip away. The Yankees had been 28-1 leading after seven innings.""Everyone has to look forward to the challenge and try to get the job done,"" Betances said.Jimenez started Baltimore\'s last loss - a 2-1 defeat in Cleveland on Saturday - and the right-hander somehow managed to dodge the decision and limit the Indians to a run after allowing six hits and issuing a season-high six walks. The good news for Baltimore is it hasn\'t been a trend. Jimenez (3-3, 3.02 ERA) totaled six walks in his previous five starts, and manager Buck Showalter saw it as an isolated incident.""He\'s not an excuse maker, but he was just having trouble gripping the balls,"" Showalter told MLB\'s official website. ""... It\'s just one of those days where it\'s windy, cool, slick.""Jimenez doesn\'t have a decision in his last four starts and is winless in five, but most of his success has come at home with a 3-1 record and 2.06 ERA in five starts.Against the Yankees, however, he\'s 2-4 with a 5.50 ERA, and he walked 14 in three starts in the series last season. Garrett Jones (5 for 11) and Carlos Beltran (6 for 15 with two home runs) have hit Jimenez well. Chris Young is 7 for 43 with 17 strikeouts and might be left out of the lineup given his 5-for-50 overall slump. Mark Teixeira (3 for 21 with eight strikeouts) and Brett Gardner (2 for 14) have also struggled against him.Michael Pineda is seeking his second three-start winning streak this season, and he should be fresh after the club elected to have him skip his last start to limit his work. Pineda (7-2, 3.33) gave up two runs and seven hits in six innings of a 7-2 win in Seattle on June 1 and has a 2.13 ERA in the last two.The right-hander is 3-0 with a 2.56 ERA in six starts against the Orioles, posting three straight victories with two coming this year behind 25 strikeouts in 13 1-3 innings.

But he survived only four and a third innings, allowing nine hits and six runs (five earned).

So it\xe2\x80\x99s a tough decision.\xe2\x80\x9dThe night of frustration got off to an early start, when the Yankees failed to score after loading the bases with none out in the first against Ubaldo Jimenez.One of the few bright spots came from the rookie Mason Williams, who started in center field and homered in his major league debut.

Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 5.2 IP, 8 H, 4 R, 0 BB, 1 K. New York strung together a few base runners in the first inning, and ended up taking a 2-0 lead on Mark Texeira\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single and Brian McCann\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-double. However Norris pitched his way out of the inning, although the O\xe2\x80\x99s had to play catch-up. The good news was that Norris stablized himself in innings two through five or so, which gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a decent amount of time to put runs on the board.\xc2\xa0Live Feed manny machadoBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenManny Machado mashes ball over Green Monster (Video) FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red Sox Call to the PenChris Sale reportedly to be suspended by MLB FanSidedBoston Red Sox Attempt to Hit Manny Machado--Again Call to the PenManny Machado rips the Red Sox for throwing behind him in NSFW rant FanSidedBefore we knew it, the game was tied in the last of the third.

I suspect they liked the fact that there was little to no drama in the ending of Friday night\xe2\x80\x99s game, and they decided to follow suit last night. In the last of the sixth they took the lead back for good on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single. Later in the inning the O\xe2\x80\x99s had runners at first and second, both of whom moved up on a wild pitch.

One inning later pinch hitter David Lough hit what at first was ruled a triple. His deep shot to right field smacked off of the grounds crew shed, which according to Camden Yards\xe2\x80\x99 ground rules, is supposed to be a home run. And it was ruled as such after an umpire review, and the Orioles led 8-4.Steve Pearce would add an RBI-double in the last of the eighth inning to run it to 9-4, as the Orioles crusied to victory once again over New York. Incidentally, the aforementioned home run was David Lough\xe2\x80\x99s first pinch hit homer of his career. The Orioles also got great contributions from Chaz Roe and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day out of the bullpen to close things out, with Roe bridging the gap from the middle innings and O\xe2\x80\x99Day pitching the ninth.Norris said after the game that he felt good, especially since he was mowing hitters down in the middle innings (quote courtesy of\xc2\xa0Bryan Hoch and Connor Smolensky of MLB.com):It felt good to get back out there and find a groove. I really thought I found a groove in the middle innings there. Buck made a decision to go to the \xe2\x80\x98pen [in the sixth], and we got out of it. We scored a bunch the next inning, and nice win. So let\xe2\x80\x99s sweep the series tomorrow.Speaking of today\xe2\x80\x99s game, the Orioles will get to add a pitcher without removing one for once. Brian Matusz\xe2\x80\x98s eight-game suspension ended after last night\xe2\x80\x99s game, so he\xe2\x80\x99ll be reinstated to the roster and the O\xe2\x80\x99s will once again be playing with the full 25 men. Before last night\xe2\x80\x99s game Matusz (after returning from Sarasota where he worked out during the suspension) talked about how good it felt to be back with the team, although he declined to comment on the point about his suspension not being reduced and Will Smith getting a two-game reduction. The last thing the Orioles need is further discipline dished out to Matusz (or anyone) for running his mouth \xe2\x80\x93 smart move on Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s part, incidentally.\xc2\xa0The Orioles will have an opportunity to sweep New York this afternoon in the series finale. By virtue of the fact that he never saw action as a reliever while sitting in the bullpen, Mike Wright will enter into the rotation this afternon in place of Miguel Gonzalez. Wright will be opposed by New York\xe2\x80\x99s Adam Warren.

Unfortunately for the Orioles, the rest of the division has turned around their slow start in the past weeks as well.

Jays JournalThe return of J.J. Hardy, Ryan Flaherty, Matt Wieters and Nolan Reimold have brought a stability to several key positions that have been struggling for consistency for most of the season, but their return has clogged up and already crowded roster.The concern going forward has to be the inflexibility of the roster, and how it could force the Orioles to cut ties with more valuable players going forward. Right now the Orioles have very few players with options, and with several players returning from injury, the logjam may prove to be a difficult puzzle yet again.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerJonathan Schoop, Wesley Wright and Rule-5 draftee Jason Garcia will all be returning from the DL in the not too distant future. The Orioles may be forced to consider dealing Travis Snider or Steve Pearce once Schoop returns, since the addition of Nolan Reimold seems to have made them somewhat expendable. The Orioles could also consider dealing David Lough, but he brings tools with his speed and defense that Snider and Pearce do not.Neither Wesley Wright nor Jason Garcia have been particularly impressive this season, but the Orioles will do everything they can to keep them on the roster, or at least not lose them for nothing.Obviously as a Rule-5 player, Garcia will be more difficult to keep on the roster. He\xe2\x80\x99s just not ready to pitch at this level, but the Orioles want him for next season. That wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be quite as difficult if their roster wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so inflexible already.With the lefties in the bullpen and in AAA, the Orioles probably just don\xe2\x80\x99t need Wesley Wright, but coming off a long stint on the DL he probably has little to no trade value. The Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give them up for nothing, even if they don\xe2\x80\x99t need him.The Orioles could look at moving Tommy Hunter, if a team would be willing to shell out a decent return. Hunter is obviously still a valuable member of the bullpen, but he is a free agent after the season, and at this point the Orioles have to find flexibility somehow.You hear often that these problems tend to take care of themselves, but that probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be the case this time. Dan Duquette always finds clever ways to negotiate situations like this, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see exactly what the roster looks like a few weeks from now.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters ReturnMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

The O\xe2\x80\x99s would have to wait to take the field against Philadelphia however, as a short rain delay preceded the game. But after that, Matt Wieters and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were ready for business.However while the game itself moved quickly, it took a bit of time for Oriole bats to get back on track against Philadelphia starter Aaron Harang. The good news was that Wei-Yin Chen matched Harang point for point. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 8 IP, 4 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 9 K. Chen was about as on point as a starting pitcher can be.

However needless to say, the Birds dealt with that better than did Philadelphia.\xc2\xa0Live Feed matt witersThe game was scoreless until the last of the fifth. Following two pop outs, Travis Snider doubled to left on a ball that was somewhat misplayed by left fielder Cody Asche. That brought J.J. Hardy to the plate, and his RBI-single gave the Orioles a 1-0 lead. That of course ended up being enough to win the game \xe2\x80\x93 but the Birds didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that at the time.One inning later we saw what a difference little things can make in games. Following a one-out single by Jimmy Paredes, Adam Jones grounded into what looked to be a double-play. However Jones hustled down the line, and Paredes made a heck of a takeout slide at second base. With one final stretch, Jones was safe at first and the play was ruled a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice as opposed to an inning-ending double-play.Courtesy Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAfter a subsequent Chris Davis walk, Matt Wieters effectively ended the evening\xe2\x80\x99s competitive phase with a three-run homer which ran the score to 4-0. Again, keep in mind what set that moment up. Jones hit a slow roller in the infield, and knew that he had a shot at staying out of the double-play. Jones\xe2\x80\x99 speed combined with Paredes\xe2\x80\x99 hard slide and Davis\xe2\x80\x99 walk a moment later brought Wieters to the plate with two runners on base.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Those are small things which don\xe2\x80\x99 show up on a scorecard that help the team as much as anything else. They may not be the most heralded of aspects of the game, but they\xe2\x80\x99re noticed by the likes of Buck Showalter and his coaches.IF/OF Chris Parmalee had today as an opt out date in his contract, which means he could in theory leave the organization at any time if he\xe2\x80\x99s not brought to the big league level. He was in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse before the game, and remains on the 24-hour taxi squad. My prediction is that he\xe2\x80\x99s activated tomorrow, and that someone is either optioned or DFA\xe2\x80\x99d. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear who that might be, however Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette might have a tough decision to make.\xc2\xa0The series with Philadephia concludes tomorrow night with Chris Tillman on the mound for the Orioles, who will come into the game standing at 6-1 on the homestand. (After the game the teams will of course head to Philadelphia for another two-game set.) Tillman will be opposed by Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s Jerome Williams.

It kept the Yankees in first place in the American League East \xe2\x80\x94 barely \xe2\x80\x94 and ended a three-game losing streak, with the help of a rally that required precious little exertion, even in sapping heat and humidity.The Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 three-run fifth inning was a walk in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 park.Trailing by 3-2, the Yankees barely needed to lift the bats from their shoulders. Orioles starter Mike Wright walked the bases loaded before he was lifted for Brian Matusz, who walked Garrett Jones for the tying run.Matusz struck out Stephen Drew and Didi Gregorius, but John Ryan Murphy grounded a double down the left-field line, just out of the reach of third baseman Manny Machado, putting the Yankees ahead by 5-3. It was their only hit of the inning.\xe2\x80\x9cI got into a good count, and he left me a good pitch to hit,\xe2\x80\x9d Murphy said. \xe2\x80\x9cI hit it hard.\xe2\x80\x9dMurphy made the most of a start, with a scheduled day off for Brian McCann, who has struggled defensively while providing a potent bat. Murphy had three hits, tying a career high, and was flawless behind the plate, helping the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 reconstituted bullpen close out the game with four and a third hitless innings.

He remains five hits shy of 3,000 as the Yankees head to his hometown.The Yankees will be without a designated hitter against the Marlins because the game is in a National League park, and Manager Joe Girardi said he did not plan to start Rodriguez, most likely using him as a pinch-hitter or in the field after a double switch.

""He felt a lot better last night, but we\'re trying to get ahead of some things with him.""The manager added: ""We explained the whole thing, and he understands, especially when we\'ve done it with him once or twice.""Chen, however, insisted on his Twitter page that he is completely healthy.""I am in excellent physical shape. I feel great and I am ready for my next start,"" he Tweeted. ""I just pitched 8 innings of shutout baseball. ... I am disappointed my routine is being interrupted.""Showalter said Chen was sent down to give him a short break. He will pitch three to four innings Saturday and return to the Orioles when he is eligible on June 26.""A byproduct with him is that it allows us to manage the roster with Chris, and a couple other factors, too,"" Showalter said.The Orioles have made similar roster moves before, most recently when they optioned Chen and right-hander Kevin Gausman in late August 2014 to add extra position players. When September call-ups came, both returned without missing turns in the rotationA former first-round draft pick by Minnesota, Parmelee, 27, had a June 15 opt-out clause in his contract. He hit .312 with 13 doubles, six homers and 32 RBIs at Norfolk and was slated to start in right field against the Phillies and bat fifth.Baltimore transferred second baseman Jonathan Schoop to the 60-day disabled list.The Orioles could\'ve also sent right-hander Mike Wright to the minors, but other candidates for a move lacked minor league options.Parmelee has a career average of .249 across parts of four seasons with the Twins before he signed a minor league contract with Baltimore in January.""We like Chris.

06/17/2015,"[('The Crazy World of the Baltimore Orioles', ""Jun 16, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones (10) pies right fielder Chris Parmelee (41) during a post game interview of the game against the Philadelphia Phillies at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Baltimore Orioles defeated Philadelphia Phillies 19-3. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles fans are very familiar with the special deal that their advertising sponsor Papa John\xe2\x80\x99s gives to fans the day after the O\xe2\x80\x99s win a game and score five or more runs \xe2\x80\x93 they get 50% off their online order. So what happens when the Orioles win by a score of 19-3?\xc2\xa0 It would seem that Papa John\xe2\x80\x99s at that point should be paying people to get their pizzas delivered to them.A Bizarre GameWere the Baltimore Orioles that good, or were the Philadelphia Phillies that bad?\xc2\xa0 Yes, and yes.The Orioles set a franchise record by hitting a total of eight home runs. Just imagine how many more there would have been if DD did not trade away Nelson Cruz and Nick Markakis!\xc2\xa0 Sorry \xe2\x80\x93 an evil spirit made me write that snotty sentence.It sounds impressive that they hit eight homers, until you realize that seven of them were with the bases empty!\xc2\xa0 Yep, that\xe2\x80\x99s typical of the Orioles. Only David Lough hit one with runners on base. So, only 10 runs were produced by the eight home runs. Earl Weaver would be disappointed in that. Maybe after wearing down the Phils\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen it will help them to do better in one of these next two games in Philadelphia.

He gave up five home runs as a relief pitcher.The interesting thing about the veteran pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s outing is that he had a lot of good movement on many of his pitches, but, \xe2\x80\x9cOops, there goes another one over the fence again!\xe2\x80\x9dThe only thing that could have made this an even more salubrious experience for O\xe2\x80\x99s fans would have been if Jonathan Papelbon was the guy setting the record. It might have even knocked the ridiculous pucker off his face.A Bizarre Roster MoveDid any of you see the Chris Parmelee addition involving Wei-Yin Chen being sent down for one start? If you answer \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you. What a world \xe2\x80\x93 pitch eight shutout innings and get sent to the minors!Apparently Chen was not exactly thrilled with the news, although the official report as spoken by Showalter would seem to indicate that the pitcher understood the reasoning.Embed TweetDoes this embitter him for offseason negotiations when he becomes a free agent? Well \xe2\x80\x93 what difference does that make? Remember, Scott Boras is his agent.The move already paid off, as Parmelee celebrated his promotion with four hits and two homers.

But those guys accounted for six home runs and a double.The most glaring thing about that is the absence of Adam Jones. I am not surprised that Jones needs a day or two off. He has had so many foul balls hit him, along with attempting diving catch plays in the past week. But who knew that leaving AJ out of the lineup would produce 19 runs?A Bizarre FutureThere seems to be no end to the way that the Baltimore Orioles creatively use the 25-man and 40-man rosters. The Orioles have already used a total of 40 different players this season.But this cannot continue forever, that is unless there are some more injuries in the near future that create movement possibilities. But Jonathan Schoop is going to be coming back, as well as Kevin Gausman. Hopefully also Miguel Gonzalez. And there are more than just these names. At some point the Orioles are just not going to be able to keep everyone.A Bizarre ScheduleSo it is on to Philadelphia for two more games. The Phils have lost eight in a row, while the O\xe2\x80\x99s finished a 7-1 homestand. What an irony it would be to see the Phillies come back to life on the home cooking and win a game or two after getting totally shellacked the past two days.It is all very strange \xe2\x80\x93 lots of strange happenings for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, but that is what makes baseball such a great sport.Next: A look at the O's great clutch hitting numbers "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles Raise Some Brows with Chen Demotion', 'So how about stashing\xc2\xa0a pitcher in the minor leagues\xc2\xa0after he had\xc2\xa0tossed eight shutout innings for the Baltimore Orioles Monday night?Is stashing a cynical word, or is it pretty much what happened? Wei-Yin Chen improved (a possible misnomer) his record to 3-4, and lowered his ERA to 2.89 by allowing the Phillies 4 hits over eight innings in a 4-0 win Monday.

And given that Mike Trout is also in the American League, that in and of itself is also debatable. However needless to say, everyone out there knows what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with the AL all-star voting, and the controversy surrounding it.Courtesy of\xc2\xa0David Richard-USA TODAY SportsFor starters, I\xe2\x80\x99m not just another writer with an east coast bias that\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly calling foul at the idea that the Kansas City Royals (a small market, mid-western team) are monopolizing the voting. But removing the location or fan base from the equation, that in and of itself is the problem. Many fans skoff at the idea of the all-star game, and in some cases I understand why. However we should also keep in mind that baseball is based largely on tradition \xe2\x80\x93 part of that tradition is the MLB all-star game.

Under no circumstances, and for no positions. With that said, here\xe2\x80\x99s the counter-argument to that: if the game is for the fans, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the fans decide who plays? And perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s a valid question.For starters, baseball\xe2\x80\x99s not a game at the professional level; it\xe2\x80\x99s a job. Yes for sure it\xe2\x80\x99s a game that everyone knows and loves, however when you\xe2\x80\x99re paid to do something (even play a game), it\xe2\x80\x99s your job. So I would ask anyone reading this, would you feel comfortable with allowing people who may or may not be educated enough in your field of choice to decide who\xe2\x80\x99s the creme de la creme and who\xe2\x80\x99s not?

So quite literally, people who vote with one team and one goal (of getting their entire team to the all-star game) in mind could be doing undue detriment to someone. It\xe2\x80\x99s too easy to say players make millions of dollars; they\xe2\x80\x99ll survive without that bonus. But would you be happy knowing that someone out there was messing with your money?So yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that all of the Kansas City Royals fans out there who are stuffing the ballot box are in the wrong. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing anything that anyone else can\xe2\x80\x99t do, mind you, however just because you can do something doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you should. That would be like saying that players and teams that \xe2\x80\x9chot dog\xe2\x80\x9d their way around the bases after a home run, or rub salt in the wounds of opponents aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing anything wrong per se..right?!Having eight members of one team in the starting lineup (when in fact many of them don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to be there) is disrespectful to the game and to the great players who play it. And yes, by virtue of the fact that non-deserving players were voted onto the team, someone\xe2\x80\x99s finances could be affected. Again, I recognize that some will say this comes off as east coast sour grapes. However I\xe2\x80\x99m far from the only writer who\xe2\x80\x99s made mention of it \xe2\x80\x93 you can put even the likes of ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Buster Olney in that same category as well.So I would submit that moving foward baseball people should choose the teams. The fact that so many New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies, and other big market teams\xe2\x80\x99 players would make the roster each year shows how biased things can be. And the fact that so many Kansas City Royals will be making it this year is indicative of the same thing. Putting the decision in the hands of baseball people will ensure that the truly deserving players are invited to the game, and start the game. Not just the players that certain people want to see. Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s all-star game is probably the most historic of all the sports. So it should thus be treated as such. Having said that, I would submit that if things remain as they are and the AL starters are eight Royals plus Mike Trout (who incidentally is a legitimate selection), fans should consider boycotting the game. But maybe not the whole game \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps just the first 40 minutes to an hour or so. By that time the second wave of players will be rotated into the game in the spirit of letting everyone play. Unless of course the Kansas City fans are expecting that their players should be playing the entire game also.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Will two NL games foul things up?More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

But that is all the ground the Orioles have been able to close \xe2\x80\x93 from five games behind to two games behind \xe2\x80\xa6 and even that is a tie for third place.All of this is because the American League East has been very recently living up to its long-time hype as the toughest division in baseball. Over this same relative span, the Blue Jays won 11 in a row, the Yankees eight consecutively, and the Rays have somehow continued to win games. Only the Red Sox have melted down \xe2\x80\x93 oh well, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to a more deserving group of __________ (insert your own insult).Just looking over the past 10 games, the Orioles have the best record at 9-1, while the Jays are 8-2, the Rays 7-3 and the Yankees 5-5.

The Orioles need to keep on winning, especially within the division where they are exactly one-half done with the schedule at 20-18.

Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Jose Bautista of course have had their kerfuffles in the past, and several Oriole hitters were hit back in September in the sequence of games in which the O\xe2\x80\x99s clinched the AL East.That brought us to this past April, when Bautista decided to\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9chot dog\xe2\x80\x9d his way around the bases after a home run,Courtesy of Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sportssomething for which he was confronted by the likes of Ryan Flaherty and Adam Jones.

Many teams out there such as Toronto and even Kansas City argue that the Orioles seem to be one of those teams who feel it\xe2\x80\x99s their duty to enforce unwritten rules.

They can\xe2\x80\x99t allow themselves to get into a back-and-forth with a team like Toronto this weekend. That would be incredibly misguided on their part.\xc2\xa0Having said that, the Orioles seem to rarely be the team that starts these types of things. That might sound short-sighted, however in general this is my observation. So what do they do if Toronto starts hitting people? Do the O\xe2\x80\x99s just stand there and take it?I suppose it matters how things go. Toronto of course knows that the Orioles see themselves as protectors of the unwritten rules. They also know that the Orioles have recently broken out of a big funk from the month of May.

But to a certain degree, yes the Orioles should let a few things go if trouble comes down the pike. However at a certain point (let\xe2\x80\x99s say if two or three hitters are hit in a suspicious manner), maybe something would need to be done. The point here is also the same for Toronto; these two teams are in the thick of the race for first in their division. Neither of them can really afford to get into something with the other.And bear in mind that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just these games of which we\xe2\x80\x99re speaking. Granted the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t want to allow themselves to get sidetracked from just playing baseball this weekend. However the worst-case scenario of course is a bench-clearing brawl. That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a draconian scenario, but work with me. Those incidents usually end with multiple players from both teams being suspended. While you never back down if someone\xe2\x80\x99s threatening you, can the Orioles really afford that?\xc2\xa0Of course not. And if the Brian Matusz situation is any indication, one could probably expect harsher penalties on the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 side if such an incident were to occur.

Well, maybe it is a bit of an over-the-top statement, but really, this current Phils team is as bad as any I have seen in many years.The Orioles simply looked exhausted from too much running around the bases of late. The Philadelphia pitching was good, but certainly not great. Manny Machado opened the game with a homer, but O\xe2\x80\x99s fans could have turned it off at that point and not missed practically any other offense at all.The Phillies\xe2\x80\x99 two runs came on a Ryan Howard home run off Bud Norris in the sixth inning with two outs. Norris had pitched well, but from Howard\xe2\x80\x99s first two times to the plate, it could be seen that he was on to Norris. We really needed to see Brian Matusz at that point, as there was no need to bleed Norris through that full inning.But, when you only score one run, you can\xe2\x80\x99t blame your starting pitcher for giving up two runs that cost you the game. And when your starter only gives up two runs in six innings, you probably should win the game.It is good to see Norris pitching better, but it is still not quite \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x9d yet. These were the Phillies, you know.On To TorontoMuch is being made of this series with Toronto \xe2\x80\x93 a team playing as well or better than the Orioles.

They are tied for second (Dodgers) in home runs with 84. The Orioles have been slugging away themselves, as of late. They hit eight HR\xe2\x80\x99s in one game this week against Philly and are fourth in the majors with 82 long balls. The Birds have scored 295 runs in 2015 which is tied for sixth (Diamondbacks) in MLB. The Blue Jays swept the Orioles at Rogers Centre in April, so the Birds will be looking for a measure of revenge. At 22-12, Toronto is one of the toughest home teams in the league. Only three games separate the top four clubs in the AL East.

This was a game that the Orioles probably should not have won. May it sink deeply into the inner psyche of the Blue Jays!!!For the second time in three weeks, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day allowed the bases to be loaded with none out, yet pitched out of it with no damage! \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not doing this intentionally,\xe2\x80\x9d he claimed after the game.

Consecutive singles by Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion were followed by a walk to Ezequiel Carrera. Time to go to work for O\xe2\x80\x99Day. He struck out Russell Martin, Dioner Navarro, and Kevin Pillar \xe2\x80\xa6 but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that easy. A Navarro monster foul was reviewed to see if it hit the fair pole for a grand slam or not! Maybe it did just a little? But the call was not overturned. See what I mean by predestination?

Included in those reports was undoubtably something about the bad blood between the two sides (possibly dating back to 2013). So these umpires were well aware of what had gone on back in April.Again, their goal is to prevent a fight. So when Bautista got hit, CB Bucknor issued warnings across the board so as to avoid further escalation. As I said in my column this morning, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Mike Wright was trying to hit Bautista. Heck, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to intentionally hit someone, don\xe2\x80\x99t just graze their jersey! But Bucknor took the stance that\xc2\xa0the law is blind in a sense, and tried to de-escalate the situation \xe2\x80\x93 which is what he\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to do.Toronto and manager John Gibbons felt they were being punished for one of their guys being hit, however that\xe2\x80\x99s also not looking past the tip of one\xe2\x80\x99s nose. The warnings weren\xe2\x80\x99t about that specific incident, they were about the past. And if Gibbons wants to argue that the past should just be the past and so forth, then he might ask his slugger (Bautista) why he proceeded to glare at Wright, argue with Wieters, and run his mouth towards the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout the entire way down the first base line.\xc2\xa0More from Adam Jones7/21 - Baltimore Orioles: Headed to sick bay6/29 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones: Hometown boy makes good6/26 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 comeback started with an Adam Jones catch6/25 - Baltimore Orioles brought back on the bat of Adam Jones6/17 - Baltimore Orioles: Adam Jones swings Birds into firstIn turn, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Adam Jones was hit intentionally either. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said thisCourtesy of Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sportsbefoe, but umpires should apply just a bit of baseball savoir faire in these cases and ask themselves if someone would hit a batter in a given situation. Odds are that a team isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to hit Adam Jones to load the bases and bring Chris Davis to the plate \xe2\x80\x93 especially with a 3-1 count.However as I said this morning, the warning was in fact in place. And as I said above,\xc2\xa0the law is blind. Had Bucknor not run Osuna and DeMarlo Hale, he probably would have had to eject Buck Showalter (who would have argued that a warning was in place and his guy got hit). To his credit, Jones didn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word on the way down to first base.Incidentally, while Bautista reacted in a predictable manner on the field, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to discuss the matter after the game. Whereas last time this flared up he ran his mouth about the Orioles to reporters after the game, last night he specifically said that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it. And that\xe2\x80\x99s to his credit.Again, whether or not the warnings were just is up to debate. My personal opinion is that while it did affect the game in a negative manner from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 perspective, it also served a purpose. The goal is to avoid a fight, and sometimes there has to be the threat of ejection or perhaps even further disciplinary action to make players think twice about what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing.This is not to say that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a time and a place for hitting batters, because as most readers know I\xe2\x80\x99m a strong believer in the unwritten codes of the game and the enforcement thereof. But the strong arm of the law also has to play a role in that, which is why CB Bucknor did what he did last night. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll even take this a step further \xe2\x80\x93 if the umpires are really on point, they\xe2\x80\x99re issuing warnings for today\xe2\x80\x99s game as lineup cards are being exchanged right now.Here\xe2\x80\x99s another interesting point regarding this; it seems like these teams\xe2\x80\x99 personalities were taken into consideration also in the events of last night. While Bucknor did what he did in the wake of a Toronto hitter being hit, it\xe2\x80\x99s plain as day that Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s a team that has no problem expressing their opinions about opposing teams and players in pubic. Jose Bautista was almost glaring accusingly at Mike Wright\xc2\xa0before that pitch grazed his jersey. And he appeared to have already rehearsed his walk down to first while antagonizing the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout.\xc2\xa0So take that, which is consistent with Bautista\xe2\x80\x99s past, and look at the quick hook that Bucknor had on John Gibbons. Then look at Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 walk to first after being hit (in effect saying and doing nothing), and look at how quickly Bucknor acted in ejecting Osuna and Hale. Granted, warnings were in place so he had to run them in a sense. But make no mistake about the fact that umpires see the mannerisms displayed by players \xe2\x80\x93 both good and bad.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Watch your backMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Mandatory Credit: John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles fell behind early in Friday evening\xe2\x80\x99s series opener with the Jays 5-0, not getting a hit until the eighth inning. And though they would make it a one-run game with the 5-4 final score, for most of the night, the game felt like it was over practically from the beginning.To look at the two starting pitchers \xe2\x80\x93 Marco Estrada and Mike Wright \xe2\x80\x93 it is not the Blue Jays\xe2\x80\x99 hurler that you would pick to have the better stuff and results. Though he is listed as 6\xe2\x80\x990\xe2\x80\x9d, wearing the high socks makes him look much shorter. And it would seem he needs a tailwind to get a pitch to hit 90 mph. On the other hand, Mike Wright is 6\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d and can flat-out bring it to the plate. But it was the Orioles would could not get any good wood on the ball.Setting the tone for the evening and knocking Wright off the rails in the first inning was umpire CB Bucknor. When Wright grazed Joe Bautista with a running 2-2 fastball, immediately the benches were warned. Bucknor overreacted, and Jays Manager John Gibbons correctly was offended \xe2\x80\x93 ending with his own quick ejection. Two doubles quickly followed, with two runs scored, and Wright was all wrong after that.The inside of the plate was taken away, while at the same time, Bucknor was not giving Wright the outside corner. Soon, too many pitches were left up in the zone, and before long it was 4-0 and Wright was out of the game after getting only four outs. While Tyler Wilson would give the Orioles 5.2 good innings while only allowing one additional run, the mountain was made and Estrada was standing on it.Later in the game in the eighth inning, Adam Jones was hit by Roberto Osuna \xe2\x80\x93 resulting in his ejection and that of the Jays\xe2\x80\x99 substitute manager DeMarlo Hale. Yes, Jones would be the O\xe2\x80\x99s counterpoint to Joey Bats being hit. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone was attempting to hit anyone else on this night.

First of all, he was not around for all of the previous foolishness and excitement between the teams. The guy just wants to get outs and prove he can stay in the majors. And it was a 2-2 pitch!And the same with Jones being hit. Osuna is trying to get out of a jam and preserve a win for his team. He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to plunk Jones to put runners on base in front of Chris Davis (not that doing such turned out to be a very scary thing on this evening!).Certainly the umpiring crew was much aware of the previous tensions between these teams and were committed to jumping proactively on a problem at its first appearance. The problem is that in trying to prevent a problem, they threw gas all over it. Without a doubt, these two teams do not like each other at all, though they now likely agree that the umpiring was dreadful.Beyond the ejections, indeed, the plate umpiring by CB Bucknor was just awful. The strike zone was all over the place. The inconsistent and lousy performances by the guys in blue should certainly be a focus of MLB, though it never seems to happen.Understand, today\xe2\x80\x99s headline aside, the umpiring did not cost the Orioles the game \xe2\x80\x93 they lost it to the Blue Jays. And maybe some people like to watch a game with the silly drama that Bucknor created, but I felt like I wasted a good Friday night.\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

However things escalate quickly at times. Toronto put two runners on with one out in the last of the seventh, and Ezequiel Cabrera smacked a three-run homer which cut the lead to 7-3. Kevin Pillar\xe2\x80\x98s subsequent solo shot cut it further to 7-4, and later in the inning Jose Bautista shot a two-RBI single to bring Toronto to within one.Tommy Hunter would relieve Tillman after only an inning and a half, however Pillar would come to the plate again in the last of the third and he\xe2\x80\x99d tie the game at seven with an RBI-single. The Orioles were on the ropes, so it seemed. They had blown the biggest of the season, against a team with whom they shared bad blood. To top it off their nemisis, Jose Bautista, appeared to have single-handedly beaten them again when he gave his team the lead at 9-7 with a two-run homer in the fourth.So here the Orioles were staring at droping two-of-three in Toronto square in the face as they headed for Boston for an off day and then a three-game set with Boston.

That brought Bautista to the plate again. While it appeared to be one of those baseball moments where nemesis\xe2\x80\x99 stare each other in the face, Bautista walked on four pitches.

Hardy came back to the plate with a shot to give his team the led. He followed up his game-tying play earlier with an RBI-single up the middle which seemed to confuse Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s middle infielders. Both thought the other would field the ball, but by the time they figured it out the ball was by them and Chris Davis was crossing home plate to give the Orioles a 10-9 lead.Hardy and Reimold would score a few moments later on an RBI-triple by Ryan Flaherty, who would score himself on Machado\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single. However this game was won by the Orioles on two things. First off, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day in the eighth. One might argue that the Orioles were afraid to let Bautista beat them, however that sly pitch-around was a key moment.Secondly, Hardy is one of the most professional hitters that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to find. He finds ways to get on base, and/or to get balls into the outfield. And he did it when the team needed it most this afternoon, giving the Orioles the game and the series.The only concern now of course is Chris Tillman, who was lifted after 1.1 innings. Buck Showalter said after the game that Tillman just needs to get back to attacking, as well as to straighten out his changeups and sliders. He also indicated that Tillman might get an extra day of rest with tomorrow being an off day in his next turn in the rotation.\xc2\xa0However Tillman aside, chalk this up as just \xe2\x80\x9cone of those games.\xe2\x80\x9d The ball was flying this afternoon in Toronto, and sometimes that\xe2\x80\x99s just how the game ebbs and flows.

At the same time it was \xe2\x80\x9cBark in the Park\xe2\x80\x9d day, with people bringing their dogs to the game.So what is wrong with Chris Tillman, who got knocked out of Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game after merely 1 and 1/3 innings, giving up six runs on six hits? Ultimately, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer. Presuming there is not a physical issue that is not being revealed, one would presume he will eventually return to the reasonably effective pitcher we have known since the middle of 2012.One could speculate that one of the problems on Sunday was the long wait between the bottom of the first and the bottom of the second. In the top of the second inning, the Orioles sent 12 men to the plate and scored seven runs. That takes time. I do think it is a fair statement to make of Tillman that he is the most regimented of the O\xe2\x80\x99s starters. He is the guy who needs routines that are predictable \xe2\x80\x93 certainly he does between starts, and maybe even between innings.

Really? He might have done worse than Tillman did on Sunday?\xc2\xa0 This year, Tillman is now 0-3 against the Jays in four starts, giving up 25 runs in 15 innings for an ERA of 15.00.Overall for 2015, Chris is 5-7 with a 6.22 ERA. This is not what the Orioles expected of their presumptive top-of-the-rotation starter.You may recall that Tillman had a rough start in 2014. There were some very bad games, but he corrected things and ended with a strong season \xe2\x80\x93 particularly in the second half. Will he turn it around again?Actually, the hole that he is in right now is larger and a bit later than in 2014. The last time he had such a short outing as yesterday was in a game against Texas on June 5th of last year. It was his 13th start of the season; yesterday was #14 for 2015.But Tillman came back in his next start and only gave up one run in six innings. It was the first of nine consecutive quality starts, and 18 of 21 for the rest of the season.Will Tillman do this again this year? My guess is that he will figure it out, though I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit I would have thought such would be done by now. This is another situation where Showalter has a long memory of the track record, and Tillman is going to be given regular chances (provided there is not an unknown physical issue) just as Jimenez was last year. But the Orioles really need him to fix things; they cannot be counted upon to put up 13 runs every time he melts down.Next: God had to have predestined the O's 5-3 win over the Jays "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Tampa Bay Rays at Baltimore Orioles - USA TODAY', ""BALTIMORE -- Baltimore's Kevin Gausman pitched 7 2/3 innings of four-hit ball to pick up his first win this season as the Orioles extended the Tampa Bay Rays' losing streak to nine games with a 5-0 victory in the first game of a doubleheader Saturday.

"", 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Are the Birds unfair in their approach?', ""We end up talking about unwritten codes fairly often when the Baltimore Orioles play Toronto. Having said that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest; I read a lot of different columns and even message boards every day. Somewhat frequently, I see fans of other teams talk about how the O\xe2\x80\x99s are a team who feels it\xe2\x80\x99s their duty to \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d the unwritten codes of the game. Do they have a point?There are two manners in which one can look at this; the likes of Jose Bautista, David Ortiz, and others would probably say that if these unwritten rules are so important, someone should write them down. Until they do, they see no problem with showing up the other team on home run trots, and using dramatics to complain about being plunked.

And I make no bones about the fact that I stand on that side of the fence. Do we really need to see guys moonwalking around the bases on home runs? Speaking for myself, I say no. And I have no problem with teams enforcing those rules \xe2\x80\x93 and yes that means plunking hitters.But as I said, there\xe2\x80\x99s a school of thought amongst some fan bases which says that teams like the Orioles are seen as going overboard with this. But does this apply to opposing teams as well. Perhaps in some cases; some of the comments Bautista\xe2\x80\x99s made over time seem to indicate that he\xe2\x80\x99s not thrilled with being told by the Orioles in a passive-aggressive manner how to behave. But\xe2\x80\xa6where does justice lie?It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough line to toe for sure. If you show someone up on a home run trot or something of the like, your general attitude is one of shock when the opposing team has an issue with it. Then there are some who say baseball players just need to grow up. I would agree \xe2\x80\x93 in the sense that you don\xe2\x80\x99t celebrate like a school kid each time you do something great.\xc2\xa0More from Adam Jones7/21 - Baltimore Orioles: Headed to sick bay6/29 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones: Hometown boy makes good6/26 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 comeback started with an Adam Jones catch6/25 - Baltimore Orioles brought back on the bat of Adam Jones6/17 - Baltimore Orioles: Adam Jones swings Birds into firstBut I digress \xe2\x80\x93 in reality should teams like the Orioles, Yankees, among othersCourtesy of Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY Sports\xe2\x80\x9ctone it down?\xe2\x80\x9d By tone it down, I mean the criticism and/or sensitivty to the unwritten rules. I think you know what my answer is from reading the earlier parts of this article. However I would say this; ever wonder why Bautista plays so well against the Orioles?Some guys have the ability to play better when they\xe2\x80\x99re despised. Bautista knows the Orioles want to beat him. And he uses their disdain to his advantage. David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez did it for years as well. And if you look at the NFL, Hines Ward of the Pittsburgh Steelers had this ability with the best of them. While I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with the manner in which Bautista approaches the game, I do respect that ability.In my own life, I\xe2\x80\x99ve probably lost more as a result of disdain clouding my judgement than I\xe2\x80\x99ve won. If someone rubs me the wrong way, I\xe2\x80\x99ve often done everything in my power to beat them. And the worst part is that those people can generally see that I don\xe2\x80\x99t like them \xe2\x80\x93 and they use it to their advantage.For the record, this usually happens for legitimate reasons. I don\xe2\x80\x99t just blindly dislike people, and neither do Adam Jones and the Orioles. But it can often be to your detriment if you take it too far \xe2\x80\x93 and I often do, for what that\xe2\x80\x99s worth.\xc2\xa0But keep in mind that the unwritten codes are in fact there for a reason. And they\xe2\x80\x99re reflective of the values of American society in the golden age of baseball. Things were a bit kinder and gentler in that era. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the era of instant gratification in which we live today\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6which is why guys didn\xe2\x80\x99t pose after home runs, or savor their little moment as they rounded the bases. So while guys who do this today aren\xe2\x80\x99t breaking the rules per se, they\xe2\x80\x99re going against the grain of the way the game has always been.

McFarland \xe2\x80\x93 He is back with the Orioles after some time in Norfolk to get some mechanical issues straightened out. Actually, he only had a 1.93 ERA in his 9.1 innings with the O\xe2\x80\x99s earlier this year, but he allowed 12 hits and 8 walks in that time!In Norfolk McFarland has started seven of the nine games in which he has pitched 34.1 total innings. So he has been stretched out a bit. He had some decent success. Even though his ERA was 3.41, the WHIP numbers were almost one-half of the ghastly numbers for the O\xe2\x80\x99s.Oliver Drake \xe2\x80\x93 It was Drake who was sent down to be exchanged for a pitcher who could provide more length \xe2\x80\x93 with Bud Norris starting and Miguel Gonzalez coming next, after being back from the DL. The Birds did not need to use McFarland in last night\xe2\x80\x99s 5-1 loss to the Red Sox. One good thing about losing on the road is that you only need to cover eight innings.Drake did not get into any games during this second stint with the Orioles. But he looks to be the real deal as a short reliever. He has a 0.67 ERA in 23.1 innings with the Tides. Is that good?Mychal Givens \xe2\x80\x93 It was great to get a look at Givens on Wednesday night as he made his debut with a 1-2-3 inning, including getting Big Papi out. It is a lively arm that he has \xe2\x80\x93 a sort of poor man\xe2\x80\x99s Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day.\xc2\xa0 It is deceptive, and I believe it will be effective. However, he might not be with the team long on this stay. Perhaps even by the time you read this he will be sent back to Norfolk to clear a space for the return of Gonzalez.

It is difficult to say. Honestly, his past two outings have been pretty good \xe2\x80\x93 so long as they lasted. It just seems that when he runs out of steam, it is pretty much all at once. But if so, this would be consistent with recovery from the previous health problems this season.So what are the chances that Norris can be a main contributor in a long run throughout the season and beyond? It hits me as equally possible and not. The only way to find out is to send him out there some more. And the only to get something back in any trade that could be made would also be to showcase that he can get people out.Actually, none of the five runs he gave up were earned. But following the two errors that put the first two Red Sox runners on base in the sixth inning, his pitches did not have the same zip as just the inning before.Steve Pearce \xe2\x80\x93 Somebody else will have to go out soon to make further roster space available. Many think it will be Pearce. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, that would be an emotional parting for Showalter who truly loves the guy and his work ethic. It is commendable.But the year he has had so far is just a nightmare. He is merely hitting .206, though he does have the six home runs and 22 RBIs in 48 games and 156 plate appearances. While .293 from 2014 might be a lot to expect to be repeated, something more like his .250 career average would seem reasonable. Again, as we often say, it is about be able to adjust to the league\xe2\x80\x99s adjustments to you.

06/26/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: How they Win 75% of Baseball Games', 'Jun 25, 2015; Boston, MA, USA; Baltimore Orioles left fielder Steve Pearce (28), center fielder David Lough (9) and right fielder Nolan Reimold (14) celebrate defeating the Boston Red Sox 8-6 at Fenway Park. Mandatory Credit: Greg M. Cooper-USA TODAY SportsWhat? Win 75% of baseball games? Nobody does that, not even the great 1969 Baltimore Orioles (109-53 = 67%). Actually, it has been done once. The 1906 Chicago Cubs were 116-36 for 76%, and even then they lost the World Series.But the Baltimore Orioles have in fact won 75% of their past 20 games \xe2\x80\x93 going 15-5 since June 4th. Amazingly, while doing that, they have only gained 2.5 games on first place in the A.L. East.\xc2\xa0 But it has been a good run for sure, going from a record of 23-29 to the current level of 38-34.So what has made this possible? What factors and areas of the team may we particularly identify as contributory to this turnaround of a season that was headed down a bad road just three weeks ago? More from Baltimore Orioles5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen workWas it the Starting Pitching?As the Orioles, particularly beginning in 2012, became a power-hitting team, the mantra was that they could only go as far as the starting pitching would take them. And then the inference was (if not openly stated) that the O\xe2\x80\x99s had lousy starting pitching and were doomed to go nowhere.There is no doubt that any successful baseball club needs good starting pitching in the big and long-term picture of things. And there is no doubt that the 2014 O\xe2\x80\x99s did a season turnaround that largely coincided with the starters putting it all together in a cohesive rotation.But quite honestly over the past 20 games, the starters have not been that great. There have been some very good efforts for sure \xe2\x80\x93 like Wei-Yin Chen\xe2\x80\x99s eight shutout innings. But the Orioles starters have now gone six games in a row without a quality start. In fact, in only six of the 20 games we are looking at have the O\xe2\x80\x99s starters completed at least six frames.So, while there have been some good efforts, it is not the rotation overall that has carried Baltimore to these 15-of-20 wins.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley The Baltimore WireCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenWas it the Power-Hitting Offense?After the Orioles chose to not re-sign Nelson Cruz, questions arose as to how they were going to cover the lost production. Over this 20-game period, the Orioles hit a total of 29 home runs. That is a pace for 235 homers in a year. The O\xe2\x80\x99s hit 214, 212, and 211 in the past three seasons. For the whole year, they are currently on pace to homer 194 times.However, over the past 20 games, eight of those 29 home run came in one game against the absolutely dreadful Philadelphia Phillies. So while the home runs have been nice additions at times, it is not what is driving the successes.Was it a Shutdown Bullpen?Much was made after last year with the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen that a new key to winning baseball in the modern era is to have a lights-out, shutdown bullpen that is filled with fresh arms who can dominate opposing hitters. This shortens games by giving opponents only six innings at best to get their offensive production done.I frankly think there is a great deal to be said about this. Of course, if the starters regularly get knocked out of games too early, it negates this strength. And likewise, if the offense if terribly weak, it cannot score enough to get leads or win games at the end.The Orioles bullpen had a rough first month of the season, ranking near the bottom in many categories. Yet since then, they have been arguably and statistically at the very top of MLB.And this is true over the past 20 games. Relievers over that time have pitched 73.2 innings and given up only 12 earned runs. That is a 1.47 ERA!\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99ll work!\xc2\xa0 And this HAS indeed been a major contributory factor in the 75% wins.Was it the Ability to Hit in Clutch Situations?A great frustration as an Orioles fan at the beginning of this recent four-year run with a winning record was to see the O\xe2\x80\x99s often unable to deliver in critical situations of runners in scoring position. They were .256 in 2012, and improved to .266 in 2013 and .268 in 2014.Over the past 20 games the Orioles are 66-for-179 for the awesome RISP average of .369!\xc2\xa0 This has pushed the O\xe2\x80\x99s into the top position in the category in all of MLB with a RISP for the 2015 season of .316, which is 11 points higher than the next team (Rockies).Summary \xe2\x80\x93 So it is the clutch hitting and shutdown bullpen that has made a seasonal turnaround for the Orioles over the past 20 games, and it also helps a great deal on the occasions when the starters and power hitters contribute well.Next: The Norfolk Shuttle Rides Again ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Roster crunch - Birds Watcher', ""With Wei-Yin Chen coming back from the minors to make tonight\xe2\x80\x99s start vs. Cleveland, the Baltimore Orioles find themselves in another roster crunch.

The Birds, who just finished a 5-3 road trip, have won 15 of their last 20 games to move to within two games of first place in the AL East.  At 38-34, the Orioles are a season-high four games over .500. Over their last seven series, they are an outstanding 6-0-1. They went 7-1 during their last home stand and don\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be slowing down. One of the main reasons that the Birds have been flying high has been their ability to hit with runners in scoring position.  For the season, the Orioles are hitting .320 as a team with RISP. That mark is the best in all of Major League Baseball. Over their last six games, they are hitting .441 (26-for-59) with RISP. DH Jimmy Paredes leads the majors with a .455 (20-for-44) average with runners in scoring position. C Caleb Joseph has been strong as well as he is hitting .361 (13-for-36) with RISP. The Orioles have scored 125 runs in June which is ranks second behind Toronto (137) in MLB. The fact that they hit well in the clutch obviously helps when it comes to run production.  If the Orioles can keep up this pace throughout the summer, they will be in contention until the end.

While trying to add to Kluber\xe2\x80\x99s woes, the Orioles also seek their 16th win in 21 contests in Friday night\xe2\x80\x99s opener to a three-game series. Kluber (3-9, 3.65 ERA) has been inconsistent in his first season after winning the AL Cy Young Award and is 0-4 with a 4.00 ERA in his last four starts. He gave up four runs and a season-high four walks in seven innings in a 4-1 defeat to Tampa Bay on Saturday. Kluber\xe2\x80\x99s teammates have hardly aided him with a combined three runs of support during his losing streak, and his 2.17 run-support average is the lowest in the majors among qualifying players. He also lost four consecutive starts April 22-May 7 while opening the season 0-5. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99d be one thing if his ERA was a 6.00 or something like that right now, but he\xe2\x80\x99s got pretty solid numbers,\xe2\x80\x9d outfielder David Murphy told MLB\xe2\x80\x99s official website. \xe2\x80\x9cHis record looks bad, but (that\xe2\x80\x99s) because baseball is a team game when it comes to that. The Indians (33-38) will try to help their ace with a performance like Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 8-2 win over Detroit. They had 13 hits in that game and totaled 25 in their final two against the Tigers after batting .219 in their previous nine. Jason Kipnis extended his hit streak to 19 games, tying Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Wilson Ramos for the longest in the majors this season, and went 5 for 10 with two doubles versus Baltimore earlier this month. He\xe2\x80\x99ll next try to provide some more assistance against the Orioles (38-34), who are batting .300 while averaging 6.7 runs in its last 15 contests. They had 14 hits in an 8-6 win in Boston on Thursday with seven coming in a six-run fourth. Manny Machado was among eight starters who hit safely and is batting .427 with six homers and 17 RBIs in his last 18 games, beginning with two in Cleveland from June 6-7. Machado had two hits in each of the final two games in that series, and Baltimore took two of three from the Indians. The Orioles have alternated wins and losses in their last seven home matchups with Cleveland. Wei-Yin Chen (3-4, 2.89) played a part in one of those defeats, giving up five runs in 6 2-3 innings May 22, 2014. He yielded one run in seven innings in his most recent start against the Indians, a 2-1 loss in 11 innings Aug. 15. Chen is 2-0 with a 1.86 ERA in his three starts this month and fanned nine in eight innings in a 4-0 win over visiting Philadelphia on June 15. Chen was then sent to Class A for a start \xe2\x80\x93 a move criticized by the left-hander and reportedly agent Scott Boras \xe2\x80\x93 and manager Buck Showalter said it was because he complained of being tired in his prior start. \xe2\x80\x9cI am in excellent physical shape.

06/27/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Chris Davis delivers the magic', ""While the Baltimore Orioles took two-of-three from Cleveland a few weeks ago, the games were fairly hard-fought. Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s a scrappy team, even if their record might not necessarily indicate that in total. So Chris Davis and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had to know that they were in for a tough game when the Tribe came to Camden Yards last night \xe2\x80\x93 and a tough game they got.Wei-Yin Chen made his return last night after his \xe2\x80\x9csabatical\xe2\x80\x9d to the minor leagues. First off let me say that far too much was made of Chen being sent to the minors for a short period, That was partially due to Scott Boras\xe2\x80\x99 comments, however Chen had options, he struggled in Toronto, and the Orioles needed a roster spot. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple math. That aside, Chen had a couple of struggles last night, but ended up pitching well. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 7 H, 2 R, 2 BB, 5 K.

The Baltimore WireIf there\xe2\x80\x99s one criticism of Chen that one could make last night, it\xe2\x80\x99s that his slider wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fooling anyone. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not said so as to jump all over the guy; sometimes that happens. But a good pitcher will always adjust when it becomes obvious that a certain pitch isn\xe2\x80\x99t working \xe2\x80\x93 and Chen did that. However Cleveland took a 1-0 lead when Brandon Moss hit a solo homer off of one of Chen\xe2\x80\x99s sliders in the second inning.But the O\xe2\x80\x99s are a pretty scrappy team also if they choose to be. Unfortunately for them, this was a night where they had to be just that \xe2\x80\x93 as opposed to getting out to an early lead. In the last of the second J.J. Hardy put Cleveland on notice that the O\xe2\x80\x99s wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go into the night without a fight with a solo homer of his own to tie the game at one. I mentioned Chen\xe2\x80\x99s adjustments above; unfortunately they came one pitch too late in the sense that Ryan Rayburn smacked another Chen slider out of the park (with nobody on base) in the fourth to give Cleveland a 2-1 lead.Hardy would figure into the game a bit later as well, when the O\xe2\x80\x99s covered the corners with one out in the last of the sixth. Hardy was abe to get the ball in the air and deep enough to center field to allow Jimmy Paredes to score from third, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly had a 3-2 lead. However this Cleveland team wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere either, and Carlos Santana tied the game with his team\xe2\x80\x99s third solo homer of the day in the top of the eight.\xc2\xa0More from Chris Davis7/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Davis sets up win in the twilight zone6/27 - Baltimore Orioles complete the sweep of Tampa6/14 - Will Chris Davis Continue His Impressive Home Run Streak?6/10 - Baltimore Orioles: Comeback kids led by Chris Davis6/1 - Baltimore Orioles: Fair is foul, foul is fairKeep in mind folks, Orioles magic happens when you least expect it \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s always been one of the marks of the \xe2\x80\x9cmovement.\xe2\x80\x9d I would submit Delmon Young\xe2\x80\x98s bases-clearing double in the playoffs last year against Detroit as an example. So after losing the lead in the eighth last night, the Birds were left searching for that magic. And they found it \xe2\x80\x93 in the form of their big slugger.Jimmy Paredes led off the last of the eighth with a double, which brought ChrisCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsDavis to the plate with a runner in scoring position. Cleveland played Davis to center in this instance, ironically not paying any attention to the fact that Davis could pull the ball. But that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he did; a sharp liner into right field scored Paredes and gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 4-3 lead \xe2\x80\x93 which turned into a 4-3 win after the ninth inning.Maybe this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true Orioles magic in the sense that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a walk off. But the concept has always been about late-inning heroics. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what Chris Davis provided last night. The Orioles now stand a half game behind New York (who\xe2\x80\x99s in second place in the AL East), and one game out of first.\xc2\xa0The one concern is that Adam Jones was still unable to play last night, but Buck Showalter said that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to wait until tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game (weather permitting) to run him into the lineup. Jonathan Schoop is set to come off the DL at some point either today or tomorrow, so I suspect that if Jones can\xe2\x80\x99t play tonight he would go to the DL to make room for Schoop. However keep in mind that the DL stint would be backdated to last weekend, so Jones would be able to come off the DL in early July.The series continues tonight, that is if mother nature allows for it.

This has been the case for most of his career now, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been an issue too long.One possible solution could be dealing Wei-Yin Chen. It\xe2\x80\x99s strange to suggest that a team so much in contention deal away one of their most consistent starters, but it may be one of the better options right now.Chen is on the last year of his contract, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t be an Oriole next season. Baseball has seen a steady increase in pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s contracts for some time now, and the Orioles just aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to give Chen that kind of money.Moving Chen before the deadline could also bring the Orioles a decent return of prospects. Those are players the Orioles could use to replenish the roster next season when so many players are expected to leave via free agency.More importantly for the moment, it would free up a rotation spot for Gausman this season, and allow the future of the Orioles to develop a sense of routine and stability.It would take the perfect package for the deal to be considered, but dealing Chen may be best for the Orioles this season and beyond.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles win 5,000\xc2\xa0 "", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: The Ups and Downs of Jimmy Paredes', ""May 26, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles designated hitter Jimmy Paredes (38) doubles during the sixth inning against the Houston Astros at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

He performed well, hitting .286 in 46 games.But in 2012 he did not make the Astros coming out of spring training; but for their AAA affiliate Oklahoma City he batted .318 with 13 homers in 124 games. He also swiped 37 bases. However, a late season call-up only saw him bat .189 in 24 games for Houston.This same story repeated in 2013. Paredes hit .287 at AAA, but with 48 games at Houston only .192.\xc2\xa0 This led to him being claimed off waivers in the offseason by the Marlins, then by the Orioles (for two days), and finally by the Royals.In 2014 the same basic story repeated of hitting well at AAA, but he only played in nine early season games for the Royals, going 2-for-10. Purchased by the O\xe2\x80\x99s in July, he was only hitting .258 at Norfolk when added to the roster for the rest of the Baltimore season. It was fresh air, as Paredes got into 18 games and went 16-for-55 for a .302 average.All totaled, he has posted a career .300 average in 307 AAA games in three organizations. And coming into this season, his career average was .247 \xe2\x80\x93 the typical marginal big leaguer.

But then he went into a nine-game funk where he was just 2-for-32. But yet again, he has picked up his stroke; and in the past 12 games he is a smoking hot .396 (higher than his OBP of .388 \xe2\x80\x93 being thrown out extending a hit, and registering no walks over that time).

They are able to understand how they are being pitched differently, and they learn over time how to make new approaches to deal with the new set of realities literally being thrown at them.

06/29/2015,"[('Orioles-Rangers Begin Four-Game Set \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Texas Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 recent play at the plate does not bode well for a team looking to end a poor stretch of performances. Neither does a road matchup Monday night with the Baltimore Orioles, who have dominated the AL West opponent in recent years. Texas (38-38) has averaged 2.9 runs while losing seven of the last eight. The Rangers were dispatched in two of three over the weekend against Toronto, losing Sunday 3-2. They had nine hits in that series finale, six from Elvis Andrus and Rougned Odor, but failed to take advantage of run-scoring opportunities by going 2 for 15 with runners in scoring position. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not how we designed it,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Jeff Banister told MLB\xe2\x80\x99s official website. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be better with runners in scoring position. Felt like we got pitched tough but really had some opportunities to drive in some runs\xe2\x80\x9d Trying to avoid falling below .500 for the first time since May 29, they\xe2\x80\x99ll face a Baltimore team that swept the Rangers at Camden Yards from June 30 \xe2\x80\x93 July 3 and has won 11 of the last 12 against Texas. The Orioles (41-34) have been on a tear of late, winning seven of their last eight for a league-best 18 wins since June 4. Manny Machado and Jimmy Paredes each hit home runs in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s early 4-0 win over Cleveland, and Machado added two more RBIs in a 8-0 win in the doubleheader\xe2\x80\x99s nightcap. Baltimore had not swept a doubleheader with shutouts in both games since Sept. 6, 1974. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep playing baseball,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more baseball going ahead. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more slumps. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more games lost coming ahead. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stay focused and just stay with the mindset that we have, which is to make the playoffs and go on forward.\xe2\x80\x9d The majority of that recent success came without Adam Jones, who had been out of the lineup since June 20 with a sore right shoulder. Jones went 14 for 26 (.538) with four homers and 11 RBIs in seven games against the Rangers last season. Wandy Rodriguez (4-3, 4.06 ERA) will try to slow Baltimore after his month-long stretch of solid play came to a crashing end with eight runs and 11 hits allowed in an 8-2 loss to Oakland on Wednesday. The left-hander had gone 3-0 with a 2.70 ERA in six starts from May 21-June 17, all Texas victories. \xe2\x80\x9cTough one, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll move on from it,\xe2\x80\x9d Banister said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure Wandy will erase this from his memory bank. If I know him well, he\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out what went wrong and move on.\xe2\x80\x9d Rodriguez has limited experience against Baltimore, facing the Orioles only twice over his 11-year career, but he struggled on May 21, 2014, while with Pittsburgh, surrendering six runs \xe2\x80\x93 one earned \xe2\x80\x93 in 1 2-3 innings of an eventual 9-8 victory. He will oppose Bud Norris (2-6, 6.70), who finally lowered his ERA below seven Wednesday, though he allowed five unearned runs in a 5-1 loss to Boston. He has edged Texas in both career meetings, most recently winning 6-5 on June 4, 2014.

The Texas Rangers did something they did not do in four attempts in 2014 \xe2\x80\x93 win a game in Baltimore. Four home runs and a bases-loaded triple spelled an 8-1 loss for the O\xe2\x80\x99s on Monday night.I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit it: I think Jim Palmer can be annoying at times as an announcer. Understand, I love the guy \xe2\x80\xa6 I grew up watching him pitch and cherish the heritage that he brings to the Orioles. But there are times he is a bit grating and comes off with a know-it-all and condescending tone \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cWelllll \xe2\x80\xa6 now here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing about that \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9dBut Palmer was spot-on with his analysis of Bud Norris and the realities of umpire inconsistencies in major league baseball.Bud Norris had a decent fastball, and the strike zone was the size of the national debt of the country of Greece. But Norris insisted on using off-speed pitches over which he had little command. They found the middle of the plate, the fat part of the bat, and the happy flight deep into the night. Choo hit a good fastball, but the others were \xe2\x80\x9chit me, hit me\xe2\x80\x9d hangers.As Palmer pointed out on several occasions, batters were behind on fastballs \xe2\x80\x93 unable to square them up and just making marginal contact. Why would you then switch to something else until they prove they can hit the fastball? Palmer constantly talks about \xe2\x80\x9cspeeding up the bat\xe2\x80\x9d by throwing a pitch of lesser velocity, and that too gets tiring to listen to. But Norris displayed the very thing that Palmer speaks of.\xc2\xa0Even Ryan Flaherty and J.J. Hardy \xe2\x80\x93 two of the meek who will inherit the earth \xe2\x80\x93 were frustrated and complaining.Beyond that, umpire John Hirschbeck was simply awful on this evening. No, it was not the difference in the game, but it was a distraction all around. The Rangers were nearly as frustrated as the Orioles. Even Ryan Flaherty and J.J. Hardy \xe2\x80\x93 two of the meek who will inherit the earth \xe2\x80\x93 were frustrated and complaining. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure when I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen a strike zone so low (and outside too). Simply crazy \xe2\x80\x93 inches below the knees.Palmer commented at length on this as well, speaking of the wide-spread inconsistencies, and of remedies the league could undertake to work toward a consistent zone from umpire to umpire. It does not happen. And on nights like this, it really distracts from the game.Hirschbeck is no stranger to controversy. Here is an article from spring training this year that talks about strike zone bantering that went on between Hirschbeck and Norris. And here is another from the 2013 season that features last evening\xe2\x80\x99s starter, Wandy Rodriguez, getting the benefit of a Hirschbeck call \xe2\x80\x93 with the writer going on at length about the antics displayed by the ump that exacerbated the problem.

And for a team that leads the world in RISP clutch hitting, they were only 1-for-9 against Texas.Back to Norris:\xc2\xa0 He now has a 6.79 ERA on the season. Some fans are calling for him to go to the bullpen, in the model of Ubaldo Jimenez last year. That day may come, but Buck has a long memory of what players have done in the past and is slow to make such moves. Other fans are ready to see him DFA-ed, especially in the current context of the roster crunch and the great interest there is in seeing Kevin Gausman added to the rotation.Honestly, Norris must not still have any lingering effects of the sickness that took him down earlier this spring. His fastball was hitting 95 and 96 even at the end of his outing. Command of off-speed pitches was the issue tonight, as well as throughout this season.However, his previous two starts \xe2\x80\x93 though losses \xe2\x80\x93 were both quite good, allowing only two earned runs in 11.2 innings on 12 hits and three walks. He has not gotten any run support in any of his three recent losses.I personally like Bud as much as any of the Orioles. His competitive spirit is totally awesome in my book! But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think his talent is at the top of class. To succeed, he has to walk a fine line rather perfectly, having good command and avoiding mistakes. This is what he is not doing. My guess is that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have until the All-Star break to find it, or he\xe2\x80\x99ll be pitching out of the bullpen.Next: The ups and downs of Jimmy Paredes ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

The Blue Jays were a fraction better at 18-9, the Rays were 16-12 and the Yankees 15-12.For a team to have the success that the Orioles enjoyed in June, it has to be attributed to the sum total of successes that individual players were posting.

07/03/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: A Place of Beginning Again', 'Jul 2, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; A general view of the game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Texas Rangers during the sixth inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are at it again. What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Getting shut out? Well, yes, there is that. It happened last night for the sixth time in 2015. This seems to be occurring more frequently than in the past, though actually, I was surprised to research that they were shut out 13 times last year. In 2013 it was six times, in 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 nine times, and in 2011 \xe2\x80\x93 seven times.To be championship outfit, a team needs to figure out how to beat the best and hottest pitchers. The Orioles did this with the Tigers in the playoffs last year, but too often they are shut down.Actually, what the Orioles have done again is give a player with a challenging track record that includes some personal indiscretions a chance to renew his career and life. Beyond that, apart from foolish life choices, the Orioles have also been a place where some players are being given a new chance to revitalize a career that has gotten stuck in the mud.Of this latter category, the list goes on and on: Jimmy Paredes, Chris Parmelee, Brad Brach, Delmon Young, Nolan Reimold, Bud Norris, Evan Meek \xe2\x80\xa6 just to name a few.But of the former category, I really respect how the organization is redemptive without being crazy about it. A player who has made a mistake or two, upon evaluation and consideration of his attitude and recovery, is occasionally welcomed to become a valuable asset again.The most famous of these, and the one that paid off the richest dividends was of course that of Nelson Cruz last year. Everth Cabrera was another who had a stain, and a list of lesser players could be produced. And then there is the internal situation with Chris Davis. Buck often says that none of us would want to have our whole lives judged by the worst moment and lowest point. That\xe2\x80\x99s a good line that has the additional advantage of being the truth.Yesterday the Orioles signed former All-Star reliever Chris Perez to a minor league deal, even though he is on a 50-day suspension for a second substance violation. There is a known marijuana situation from a couple of years ago. Perez will join the organization in Sarasota, where I suspect much more than baseball rehabilitation is on the regular agenda. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to rebuild it all, and if he does, the Orioles will have something; and if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, he\xe2\x80\x99ll eventually be gone like a certain left-handed reliever of the past who is apparently now out of baseball.Perez just turned 30 on Wednesday. And I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll be shocked to learn that he was a former first-round draft pick \xe2\x80\x93 what else would Duquette sign? It was in 2006 by the Cardinals.His best success was in 2011 and 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 All-Star seasons \xe2\x80\x93 with the Cleveland Indians where he saved a total of 75 games. However, even then his ERA was well over 3.46. Over his career, Perez has walked 3.9 batters per nine innings. To put that into perspective, Ubaldo Jimenez has only been slightly higher at 4.1.\xc2\xa0 However, Brian Matusz is at 5.3 for this season, but that\xe2\x80\x99s another story.So do the Orioles have something in Perez?\xc2\xa0 You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to bet on it. But a new life in a new place \xe2\x80\x93 a place we know to be a healthy environment \xe2\x80\x93 could make a difference both on the field and off. The risk is small. The effort is honorable.Next: Looking back at the top 7 Orioles from JunesMore from Baltimore Orioles5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Who is All-Star Worthy?', ""The Baltimore Orioles find themselves back where they finished last season, sitting in first place in the American League East. Buck Showalter has his team back atop the division despite the struggles throughout the season. There have been times the offense has been miserable. The pitching questionable. Mental errors on the defensive end and base paths that are not typical of a Showalter-led team. However, as we are just a few games away from the All-Star break, the reigning AL East champs are right where they want to be.\xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen workThe Orioles have been one of the best teams in baseball since Buck has taken over as manager. He has turned a losing culture into one that feels like it will win every day. He deserves all the credit he garners, but also has the added benefit of having some of the best players in baseball on his team. Adam Jones is not only the face of the organization, but one of MLB\xe2\x80\x99s brightest stars. Matt Wieters is a three-time All-Star. Baltimore had five players selected in 2013.The controversy surrounding this year\xe2\x80\x99s All-Star voting is the Kansas City Royals essentially taking over the process. At one point during the ballot, there were eight Royals scheduled to start the game. The number has subsided over the recent weeks, but there are still going to be more Royals starting the game than should be. That takes away spots from many players who have earned the honor.So while we know there are going to be a few Royals in the ball game, how many Orioles are All-Star worthy in 2015?Jones is always a candidate to make the Mid Summer Classic, but one would think that Showalter is hopeful that Jones\xe2\x80\x99 name is not called. The Gold Glove outfielder has been battling an injury over recent weeks and the team would like him to take the days off to rest his ailing shoulder. Jones was lights out in April, batting .400 with five home runs and 19 RBI in the first month. His bat cooled off for the month of May, but he\xe2\x80\x99s been red-hot again as of late. It would not come as a surprise if the unquestioned leader of the Orioles clubhouse was elected back as an All-Star Game for his fourth consecutive appearance and fifth total.Pitchers are not selected by the fans. Managers and players vote and then Ned Yost will make the final decisions with the help of the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s Office. Every MLB team must have one All-Star in the game which can snub a few deserving All-Stars a chance at the game. Ubaldo Jimenez is having a bounce back year, but he nor the rest of the starters have been spectacular this season. Mangers are asked to bring three relief pitchers, however, and the Orioles have one of the best in baseball.Zach Britton has been phenomenal since taking over the closer role last season. In just a year and a half as the closer, he has already recorded 60 saves. He has converted 23 of 24 save opportunities this season and is sporting an ERA of 1.82 and a 1.01 WHIP. He\xe2\x80\x99s tied with Angels closer Huston Street for second in the AL in saves, behind the Minnesota Twins Glen Perkins. It would come as no surprise if the trio mentioned is Yost\xe2\x80\x99s choice of relievers for the AL squad.\xc2\xa0oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dCurt Schilling Continues to be an EmbarrassmentMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday1 d - Fantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL1 d - Boston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue3d - Baltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red SoxMore News at Birds Watcher  If the Orioles are only going to get one selection for the game, it has the be the best player on the team. Early in the season, that was Jones. However, over the course of the season, the best player in Baltimore right now is Manny Machado. In fact, there needs to be a serious discussion about whether Machado might be the best player in all of baseball.His defense is out of this world. Playing shortstop for the majority of his life leading up to Orioles, he has made the transition to the hot corner look so easy. The way he covers so much ground and fires it to first so easily is fascinating to watch on a regular basis. It seems like he is on every top-10 sports highlight show in America on a regularly basis. Baltimore was blessed to watch Brooks Robinson work his magic at third, and Machado is the modern day sensation.He is just as good at the plate, too. He is fifth in the AL in hits with 93 and is batting .302/.357/.523 on the season. He has shown us his power with 16 home runs. The 16 stolen bases and 51 runs show us his wheels on the base paths. His line in the month of June was unreal for a 22-year-old, hitting .365/.411/.635 with eight home runs, 22 RBI, 23 runs and four stolen bases. Machado is the true definition of a five-tool player.All of these Orioles are deserving of an All-Star appearance, but it is going to take Ned Yost\xe2\x80\x98s vote to get them in. Machado is way behind his nemesis Josh Donaldson in votes, but that is no knock on either player. Donaldson is having a terrific year in his own right. Jones is likely in as a starter if the voting was done right. Britton has done everything right to earn some national recognition.It is likely that not a single Oriole is named a starter when the starters are revealed on Sunday night. There will be one on the squad for sure, and it will be interesting to see just how the rest of the league views the the first-place Baltimore Orioles.Next: Baltimore Orioles: A Place of Beginning Again "", 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

League-wide today we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing teams wearing the patriotic uniforms, with red, white, and blue inlayed on their jerseys and caps. In some manner this is in fact a marketing scheme \xe2\x80\x93 it gets people to buy merchandise.However DC news/talk station WTOP published this article\xc2\xa0yesterday about how our Stars and Stripes inspires intense feelings. Granted, those feelings aren\xe2\x80\x99t always necessarily positive, even among our own citizenry. But I can tell you from my own experiences at my family\xe2\x80\x99s ancestral home in Italy that we\xe2\x80\x99re one of the only nations in the world that holds so much pride in our flag and our traditions. This is not to say that other nations aren\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cproud,\xe2\x80\x9d because they should be. But many don\xe2\x80\x99t have the same pomp and circumstance that we do in various elements.So perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s a marketing ploy worth having \xe2\x80\x93 the patriotic uniforms, that is. And the same is true with all of the pomp and circumstance surrounding Independence Day and everyday life in America. Granted we have so many different sports that keep us busy all year. However baseball is and always will be America\xe2\x80\x99s pasttime.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsSo what has become of the Baltimore Orioles offense, having been shut down two consecutive days with zero runs and only seven opportunities with runners in scoring position? After a month of June where they outscored opponents 148-102, with a 5.29-runs per game average, one would not expect the spigot to turn off so suddenly.I truly think the answer is primarily one thing about all others combined: they have simply run into some pretty good pitching \xe2\x80\x93 both starters and bullpen. It has also seemed that an unusual percentage of those balls that have been fairly well \xe2\x80\x9csquared up\xe2\x80\x9d have been hit hard right at someone.Along the way, the Orioles have had good pitching, only allowing three runs. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have the pitching stay consistent than the hitting, but nothing beats both working together. Easier said than done.But all to say: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the Orioles are falling into some sort of team hitting slump. On quite a few swings and fly balls even last night, there was the look that they just missed on catching it square.

But the question is asking beyond that time, who is the next to be designated like Delmon Young?As always, there is the regular possibility that at any moment, an injury could change the entire landscape. But apart from that, it would seem that an outfielder has to go in order to bring Jonathan Schoop aboard. I can\xe2\x80\x99t see the Orioles leaving the presumptive long-term second baseman in the minor leagues, especially if he is hitting there, which he is.Jimmy Paredes has performed far too well to lose, even if they still need to somehow find a position for him. Chris Parmelee is not only a solid player thus far this year, he is a future piece in the probable loss of Chris Davis. Travis Snider has another year under team control, and though he does not look awesome, his production numbers are at least decent.So it really comes down to Reimold or David Lough. The Orioles really do have a plethora of left-handed hitters in the aforementioned names, along with using Chris Davis often now in right field. Remember too that Ryan Flaherty can play corner outfield. With Young gone, Reimold looks to be more necessary to retain.It has always been presumed that Lough\xe2\x80\x99s ticket to remain on the roster is that he serves as the backup for Adam Jones. Up until the past couple weeks, a Jones backup player could easily be forgotten or overlooked. Adam plays all the time \xe2\x80\xa6 until recently. His style of play makes him a bit more vulnerable to some besetting injuries as he ages.So the question comes down to whether or not it is deemed that Nolan Reimold is an adequate replacement in center field. I think the answer is \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d and that, at some point in the next week, the Orioles will have to reluctantly bid a likely farewell to Lough.Lough is only hitting .216, and though considered a fast runner, he has been thrown out in 4-of-5 base stealing attempts. He\xe2\x80\x99s a good guy and a good athlete, but I think the numbers simply catch up to him. These are problems that long-term winning organizations face. We\xe2\x80\x99re just not used to that in Baltimore.Next: Baltimore has become a place of starting over again for numerous players ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles finally score still lose to White Sox 3-2 - USA TODAY', 'Baltimore Orioles starter Chris Tillman delivers a pitch during the first inning of a baseball game against the Chicago White Sox Saturday, July 4, 2015, in Chicago.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsWith a completed first half-season of baseball (81 games) in the books for 2014, Jonathan Schoop returned to the Baltimore Orioles on Sunday in Chicago to incite a turnaround from their three-game losing streak. The offense \xe2\x80\x93 so powerful throughout June \xe2\x80\x93 had seemed to disappear in July. But it returned in good form on Sunday in a strong 9-1 drubbing of the White Sox.A critical early hit was the second inning home run of Schoop \xe2\x80\x93 a no-doubter deep into the left field stands to give the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 2-0 lead at the time. And his arm on defense was displayed in a relay throw to nail a runner attempting to stretch a double. Together, it was a reminder of the resident skills in the big second baseman.

Among them \xe2\x80\xa6Taking advantage of mistakes and opportunities \xe2\x80\x93 In the recent string of losing games, the Orioles have not accrued any benefit from the few chances presented to them to score a few runs. They were 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position in the first two games. But on Sunday they jumped on the Sox and their four errors to break the game open.Adam Jones \xe2\x80\x93 Without doubt, Jones has not been himself after some nagging injuries over the past couple of weeks have affected his game. He was 5-for-36 coming in, but he had two doubles on the day, the first scoring the opening run of the game in inning one.Caleb Joseph \xe2\x80\x93 Also struggling at the plate has been the O\xe2\x80\x99s every-other-day catcher. Joseph had perhaps the biggest hit of the game with a double on a nine-pitch at-bat to drive in the third and fourth runs.Steve Pearce \xe2\x80\x93 The first half of the season has not been what Pearce had in mind for 2015. He came in batting .219. But on this day he collected three hits and made a great defensive play.Miguel Gonzalez \xe2\x80\x93 Sunday saw the Miggy that O\xe2\x80\x99s fans are used to seeing. It was a very good game after three non-characteristic starts that have been quite difficult and sub-par. Gonzalez was great in the second half last year, and hopefully this can be the beginning of the same for this campaign.The Orioles have six games upcoming in the week ahead: three in Minnesota and three at home against the Nationals. If they could win four of the six games, it would put them at 47-41 at the All-Star break. That is not awesome, but it is better than we could have hoped for even a month ago.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsFrom time to time I dig through the statistics of the Baltimore Orioles hitters, going position by position to see how they rank with the rest of the American League. We are halfway through the season. This exercise always surfaces some pleasant surprises and some shocking negatives.In the pleasant surprise category is the combined batting average of all Orioles right fielders at .291 and second in the league, even as their combined RBI totals are near the bottom.In the shocking category is seeing the combined batting average of all O\xe2\x80\x99s left fielders at 12th in the league at .221.\xc2\xa0 Ugh!\xc2\xa0 I guess that is not terribly surprising given the early season troubles of Alejandro De Aza, and nobody else has claimed that position on a daily basis.And in the category of \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid that might be true,\xe2\x80\x9d it is grievous to see the combined second base batting average as 10th in the league at .241.\xc2\xa0 But it is true that the power numbers in home runs and RBIs are among the best in the A.L.Here is a chart of the Orioles hitters, position by position, and how they rank in the American League. After the graph we\xe2\x80\x99ll make a few comments on each position.PositionAverageHRsRBIsCatcher.237 (6)8 (10)35 (7)1st Base.243 (9)19 (4)51 (5)2nd Base.241 (10)8 (5)39 (4)3rd Base.299 (2)17 (3)47 (2)Shortstop.226 (12)6 (3)28 (6)Left Field.221 (12)8 (7)25 (13)Center Field.274 (8)12 (2)44 (3)Right Field.291 (2)10 (11)37 (9)D.

Even though Wieters has obviously better production numbers (though that has cooled off in recent games), Joseph does have a very good on-base percentage of .317 for a player that is only batting .239.\xc2\xa0 He does however strike out in about 25% of plate appearances.

A surprise here is to see that Steve Pearce is batting .317 when playing first base \xe2\x80\x93 16-for-51 with three doubles and three homers. Does his position defensively affect him greatly on offense?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a reporter here, but his batting average apart from playing first base is .194.2nd Base \xe2\x80\x93 It has been a long, long time since the Orioles had much of a batting average contribution from the second base position, and this continues to be a reality. However, they get above-average power from the likes of Ryan Flaherty and Jonathan Schoop. Exactly one-half of the at-bats are from Flaherty, who has hit .254 when playing second.3rd Base \xe2\x80\x93 Obviously, and not surprisingly, Manny Machado has this position\xe2\x80\x99s numbers near the top of the American League. It has been a great year and a pleasure to see him achieving at the very high level of the hopes everyone has had for him. The impressive item in this number is to see his RBIs total of 47 as second in the league \xe2\x80\x93 most of this from the leadoff position (34 total).Shortstop \xe2\x80\x93 Though we would not expect J.J. Hardy and the other O\xe2\x80\x99s who have played shortstop to have these stats in the top third of the league, neither would we expect them to only be better than three other teams. Everth Cabrera\xe2\x80\x99s 19-for-91 (.209) really pulls the numbers down. Also giving some better feeling to these stats is the way that Hardy has a special gift for delivering in clutch situations \xe2\x80\x93 bang for the buck.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore43m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d agoLeft Field \xe2\x80\x93 There is not much in the way of any sort of excellence that stands out among the seven players who have been in left field for the Baltimore Orioles. The most at-bats have come from Travis Snider, who is hitting .240 while playing there. The best overall numbers are surprisingly from David Lough \xe2\x80\x93 13-for-48 with a .271 average.Center Field \xe2\x80\x93 Adam Jones helps these numbers to be near the top, especially in terms of power \xe2\x80\x93 second in home runs and third in RBIs.\xc2\xa0 But it is surprising to see the .274 batting average as only in the middle of the pack. There are some very good A.L. center fielders.Right Field \xe2\x80\x93 As mentioned above, the .291 average is surprising and certainly a good statistic. This is about Markakis-like numbers, while the 10 homers are above what he would have provided. The combination of Snider, De Aza, and Chris Parmelee are 40-for-121 for an average of .331.\xc2\xa0 Chris Davis will likely bring the overall average down, while increasing the power stats.Designated Hitter \xe2\x80\x93 Jimmy Paredes represents 70% of these statistical numbers and is batting .319 as a DH. Very good!\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately all other are only hitting 16-for-83 for an average of .189 \xe2\x80\xa6 so, why not just let Paredes do it most nights?Overall, again, it may not be as good as we hoped for; but everyone is pretty much with the team now, healthy, and ready to contribute at a higher level in the second half.We\xe2\x80\x99ll come back in the next day or two with some overall pitching statistics for the first half of the season.Next: Jonathon Schoop leads revived O's offense "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Jones, Machado on AL All-Star Team', 'The pitchers and reserves for the 2015 MLB All-Star Game were announced on Monday night, and four members of the Baltimore Orioles received nods for the American League team, after receiving no selections to the starting lineup.

The Final Vote for the AL also features two outfielders, Yoenis Cespedes and Brett Gardner.It\xe2\x80\x99s a crowded outfield that Jones is going to try and break into, but I believe that he is the second best outfielder on the team, only behind Trout, and that he is more than deserving of significant playing time in the game.The only thing that might hurt him is the nagging injuries that have plagued him throughout the year.For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, in the fan voting, Jones finished seventh amongst outfielders, behind the three starters, Bautista, Cespedes, and Alex Rios. jQuery( document ).ready( function() {if ( typeof otsembed !== \'undefined\' ) {otsembed.embed( {target: ""otsvideo135071322"",segment: ""135071322"",showHeader: false } );}} ); Machado is the only third baseman on the reserve roster, though he could be joined by Mike Moustakas, via the Final Vote.Machado currently sits at eighth in the majors, fourth in the AL, in WAR. Machado also finds himself in the top ten in the AL for hits, home runs, runs, slugging percentage, and stolen bases.Machado is one of the best young players in baseball, but so is starter Josh Donaldson, who is more than deserving of his starting spot. Machado should see a little time in this one, but expect to see plenty of Donaldson, who only received the most All-Star votes any player has ever received.As for Britton and O\xe2\x80\x99Day, they join a stacked pitching staff that Ned Yost is going to have a lot of fun managing for the night.Considering the Orioles have no starters, four All-Stars is an impressive number, and all four guys have put together legitimate All-Star seasons. jQuery( document ).ready( function() {if ( typeof otsembed !== \'undefined\' ) {otsembed.embed( {target: ""otsvideo135071324"",segment: ""135071324"",showHeader: false } );}} ); Baltimore has been heating up over the past month or so, and they\xe2\x80\x99re starting to show why they have been in playoff contention for the past few years.

Schoop homered in his first at-bat since coming off the DL to help propel the Orioles to a 9-1 victory over the White Sox in the series finale. The 408-foot blast off Chicago lefty Carlos Rodon gave the Birds a 2-0 advantage and a much-needed boost to a struggling offense. Heading into Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game, the Orioles were mired in an 0-for-16 slump with runners in scoring position and had scored just two runs in their previous three games combined. Rather surprising numbers for a team that leads the majors in team batting average with RISP (.306) and had scored 148 runs in June. Of course, slumps do happen and the Birds were certainly going through one last week. The previous week started well enough for the Orioles as they shutout the Cleveland Indians twice in sweeping a doubleheader last Sunday at Camden Yards. The Birds even ascended to the top of the AL East standings before losing five of their next six games. For the most part, the starting pitching for manager Buck Showalter was good enough to succeed. Unfortunately, the bats went to sleep for a few games. Obviously, the opposing pitchers deserve some credit for keeping the Orioles off the scoreboard. Heading into Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s series opener against the Twins at Target Field, the Orioles rank sixth in MLB in runs scored (370) and are fifth in HR\xe2\x80\x99s (99).

Machado is arguably one of the best players in baseball right now. He hits for average and power, steals bases and is a Platinum Glove winner. Jones will be making his fourth consecutive All-Star appearance and also one of the best at his position. Britton has saved 23 games in 2015, good for second-best in the AL, and 60 saves since taking over the closer role last May.But Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day?! That shocked everyone. Well, everyone who does not follow the Orioles and the game of baseball. O\xe2\x80\x99Day has been the unsung, late-inning firearm for Buck Showalter in his four years in Baltimore who is finally getting the glory he deserves.Britton gets a lot of the credit for the Orioles because he earns the statistic for an earned save in most of his work. The 23 saves, 1.82 ERA and 1.01 WHIP are phenomenal numbers for Britton, and certainly All-Star worthy. They just do not compete with what O\xe2\x80\x99Day has done for the Orioles.O\xe2\x80\x99Day has given up just four runs and has struck out 43 batters in 32.2 innings of work, while issuing just eight walks for a WHIP of .0796 and a 1.10 ERA. Opponents are hitting just .151 against the 32-year-old who is 5-0 on the season and has a couple of saves to his credit as well.The numbers are even more astonishing over the course of his tenure with the Birds. The submarine pitcher has compiled a 22-6 record while striking out 244 batters, and is sporting a ridiculous .092 WHIP and 1.91 ERA in 230.1 innings of work since being claimed off waivers from the Rangers in 2011. He could be the best setup man in baseball.If O\xe2\x80\x99Day is not the best setup man in baseball, Kansas City Royals manager Ned Yost knows two damn good ones pretty well. It is not often that non-closer relief pitchers get recognition, but Yost has three of the best in baseball at his disposal in O\xe2\x80\x99Day and fellow Royals Wade Davis and Kelvin Herrera. Davis was selected by the players, while Herrera and O\xe2\x80\x99Day were manager\xe2\x80\x99s decisions. That is a great deal of respect from a manager that is supposedly going for the win to secure home field advantage in the World Series.The 2015 MLB All-Star Game will be played exactly a week from today at the Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati on Tuesday, July 14.For the casual baseball fan that will tune in to watch the All-Star Game, once they see his side-arm delivery used to perfection, they are sure to remember who Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day is.

In a similar article yesterday we detailed how the O\xe2\x80\x99s ranked position by position around the league.Overall, the pitching is going to rank just a bit better than did the hitting. With most of the offensive stats averaging out at the end of analyses as about league average, the pitching stats will be mostly just slightly above the norm, particularly on the strength of the bullpen.To lay out some raw numbers, here they are (with A.L. ranking) in three categories: for the overall staff, for the starters, and finally for the bullpen. The five categories for this general overview are: earned run average, batting average against, walks/hits per innings pitched, home runs allowed. We\xe2\x80\x99ll give some other statistical rankings in the remarks below the graph.ERABAA WHIPK/BBHRsTotal3.68 (6).245 (6)1.26 (7)2.56 (9)88 (3)Starters4.12 (9).256 (6)1.30 (8)2.42 (11)65 (1)Bullpen 2.86 (3).224 (4)1.18 (4)2.78 (4)23 (10)\xc2\xa0It is immediately clear from these numbers that the bullpen has had overall better success than the starting pitchers. And this is after the pen had a terribly horrific month of April that placed them #14 overall in the American League.The Baltimore starters have not been terrible, but our simple memories of the season \xe2\x80\x93 totally apart from statistics \xe2\x80\x93 would tell us that this has been a very up and down situation.The overall batting average against is really not bad at all \xe2\x80\x93 starters and relievers. The problem however has been in the area of allowing too many walks. All totaled, the Orioles have given up the third-most free passes in the American League with a total of 246. The starters have yielded the fourth-most, and even the bullpen has allowed the sixth-most bases on balls.And the strikeout numbers for the O\xe2\x80\x99s are not exceptional, especially for the starters who are 11th in the league. The bullpen, however, ranks third; this gives a total ranking at the center of the league in the #8 position.Another strong statistic for the bullpen is the conversion of save opportunities. As a team they are 26-of-31 for an 83.87% ratio \xe2\x80\x93 ranking #2 in the A.L. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen workWe all know how rare complete games are in the modern game. The Baltimore Orioles are one of only two teams that is yet to have a complete game. Oddly enough the other is the Tampa Bay Rays, who are the #2 overall team in ERA at 3.12.For the Orioles to have success over the second half of the season, the starters are going to need to pick up the pace and have a campaign like the summer and fall of 2014. The bullpen needs to also remain consistent. And beyond this, the offense has to be able to hit with better consistency, even against the best pitching that is thrown at them.The Orioles are healthier now, and the talent is certainly in the clubhouse to repeat and make a legitimate run through the playoffs. It is a matter of living up to that talent and making it happen on the field. They are at this moment a statistically slightly better than average team, so it is no surprise that they enter this evening\xe2\x80\x99s game with a record of 43-40. They can be better than this; I believe them to be better than this.Next: Ranking the O's in the A.L. position by positionMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore43m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles-Twins Preview: Game 2 \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Minnesota Twins relied solely on the home run to top the Baltimore Orioles in the opening contest of a three-game series, but now facing a red-hot Kevin Gausman, the AL Central contenders may need to seek out a different method of production. Whatever the route, Brian Dozier figures to again be a focal point Tuesday night when the Twins try for their first consecutive wins in nearly three weeks. Torii Hunter and Aaron Hicks each hit homers Monday, and Dozier delivered the walk-off two-run shot as Minnesota (44-39) defeated Baltimore 4-2 in 10 innings. The Twins have five home runs in their last three games, accounting for seven of their 11 total runs. In his last four at home, Dozier has six RBIs and a 1.039 OPS. He leads the AL with 46 extra-base hits and his 17 home runs are the most among second basemen. Those numbers were not enough to include him in the AL\xe2\x80\x99s initial All-Star game roster, although Dozier could still be added courtesy of the Final Vote. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been the best second baseman in baseball for the last year and a half,\xe2\x80\x9d closer Glen Perkins told MLB\xe2\x80\x99s official website. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an All-Star player.\xe2\x80\x9d Dozier\xe2\x80\x99s powerful display could be difficult to replicate against Gausman (1-0, 3.09 ERA), who has not allowed a home run in his last 17 1-3 innings \xe2\x80\x93 a streak that dates back to April 19. The right-hander impressed in his second start of the season, tossing 6 1-3 shutout innings and matching a career high with seven strikeouts in a 2-0 loss to Texas on Thursday. He has similarly excelled in his last four relief appearances, tallying six scoreless innings before landing on the DL May 8 with right shoulder tendinitis. Gausman has a 2.04 ERA over six starts dating back to Sept. 6, and following his most recent performance, manager Buck Showalter opted to keep the 24-year-old in the rotation and move Bud Norris to the bullpen. \xe2\x80\x9cWe like Kevin and we think he\xe2\x80\x99s a guy on a given night that gives us a good chance to win,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs evidenced by his last outing and a lot of outings, he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing it for a while. Obviously, we are all about this year and today\xe2\x80\x99s game and tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s game, but you are thinking down the road, too.\xe2\x80\x9d He shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t count on much run support from his teammates, with the Orioles totaling 24 runs \xe2\x80\x93 nine coming in one game \xe2\x80\x93 during a 2-6 stretch. Baltimore (43-40) is 6 for 53 (.113) with runners in scoring position in that eight-game span after going hitless in eight opportunities Monday. Monday\xe2\x80\x99s victory was the third straight at home for Minnesota, which has won\xe2\x80\x99t won two in a row overall since a three-game run June 17-19. Kyle Gibson (6-6, 3.04) looks to continue a string of solid outings for the Twins. The right-hander tossed four-hit ball over eight innings and struck out seven in a 2-0 win at Kansas City on Thursday. It was the second straight win for Gibson, who has a 2.45 ERA in his past four starts. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s had a couple really good starts after a couple that were less in terms of command and things like that,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Paul Molitor said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99s developed a really good mentality about how he goes out there and the way he wants to perform to give our team a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Mauer is 17 for 40 (.425) with 12 RBIs in his last 11 games against the Orioles.

It was a little crowded on the sidewalk, so I turned sideways, and tripped over a crack on the sidewalk.""I said, ""What the hell? I\'m a professional athlete. How can I be tripping over a small crack?\' It was unbelievable.""That was when I knew I had to have knee surgery.\'\'Once again, for the second time in 11 months - this time, on his right knee.""I was devastated,\'\' Machado said. ""To go through everything I did the first time, to go through the process and getting my strength back and everything, and then it for it to happen again. It was hard, man, it was hard.""It gets to you mentally. You start thinking about everything. People wonder if you\'ll ever be the same player. It just beats you up.\'\'Machado rubs his chin, slowly shakes his head, and breaks into a wide grin.Man, how life has changed since his last visit to Chicago.""It\'s like I\'m living a dream now,\'\' Machado said. ""It just feels like I\'m back, being the player I\'m supposed to be.""Really, it feels almost like I\'m making up for lost time.\'\'Even when infirm. Machado still played and homered that night after the offensive cheesburger.And he\'s discovering life just keeps getting better, especially when you\'re just celebrating your 23rd birthday Monday.Let\'s see, he wakes up in Minneapolis and spends the morning with his newlywed, Yainee, the sister of San Diego Padres first baseman Yonder Alonso, reminiscing about their honeymoon in the Maldives, with a side trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates.He arrives at Target Field, and is informed that he has been selected to the All-Star Game, receiving the second-highest vote total by the players among American League third basemen, behind Toronto\'s Josh Donaldson.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } First-timers, comeback players highlight All-Star rostersAnd just two pitches into the game, Machado, the Orioles\' youngest leadoff hitter since Paul Blair in 1965, launches a homer over the right center-field wall. It\'s his career-high 18th of the year, and his major-league-leading 10th to lead off an inning.He\'s batting .301 this season with 47 RBI, to go along with 13 stolen bases and 47 extra-base hits, keeping the Orioles smack in the American League East race.""There isn\'t a series that goes by,"" says Orioles manager Buck Showalter, ""where I don\'t look at (bench coach) John Russell and say, ""You got to be kidding me?\'""You forget sometimes how young he is, but you never want to suppresses that personality and imagination. And Manny has great imagination. He does things you just can\'t teach.""The good Lord kissed him right on the forehead.\'\'Machado\'s never made it through a full major league season. He got to game No. 156 in 2013 before suffering gruesome right knee injury while running out a ground ball at Tampa Bay. The partially torn knee ligament and surgery cost him the first month of 2014, a year that ended in August when his left knee gave way.Still, he feels like he\'s holding a winning lottery ticket.""Sometimes, I can\'t believe how fortunate I am,\'\' Machado says. ""I\'m living a childhood dream, and after everything I\'ve been through, it just feels so good to be Manny again.""This is everything I always wanted.\'\'Machado\'s mind, furiously racing now, thinks back to the heartbreak of two major knee surgeries within 11 months, watching his teammates celebrate the AL East title without him, seeing his teammates lose to Kansas City in the postseason and wondering whether he could have made a difference, all of those long days of rehab, the wedding, the honeymoon, and he arrives at a conversation he had with first-base coach Wayne Kirby.It was on June 3 in Houston.Machado, frustrated he wasn\'t off to a better start, hit a sharp grounder to lead off the sixth inning against the Astros. He thought it was a hit, only for shortstop Jonathan Villar to make a fine play, and throw out Machado by a step. If Machado sprinted right out of the batter\'s box, he would have beaten it out. Yet, his lack of hustle cost him a hit.Kirby, an eight-year veteran in the major leagues, pulled him aside and scolded Machado, telling him that he has too much passion for the game to be treating it like this. Respect the game, Kirby told him, and it will respect you right back.""You can\'t take this game for granted,\'\' Kirby, 51, told him. ""The baseball gods will reward you when you play the game the right way, and he wasn\'t playing it the right way. If you love the game, and enjoy playing the game, why can\'t you run and do the right things, and become a ballplayer everyone wants to see play?\'\'Machado quietly listened, and vowed to himself that he would change before it was too late.""Oh, my Lord,\'\' Kirby said. ""Ever since that night. \xe2\x80\xa6..\'\'Indeed, in the five weeks since their talk, Machado is hitting .360 with 10 homers and 25 RBI.""He told me that if I want to be a Hall of Famer,\'\' Machado said, ""go out there and hustle every day. You can\'t control the game\'s outcome, or how many hits or homers you get, but you can control how you hustle.""Once he told me that, my game has changed night and day.\'\'Machado is reminding folks once again that he\'s the Orioles\' greatest third baseman since Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson. He could also become the first player in franchise history to hit 30 or more homers with 30 stolen bases, prompting Showalter to raise a Bobby Bonds cmoparison thanks to the late All-Star\'s five 30-30 seasons.Did we mention Machado\'s only 23?The same age as the Chicago Cubs\' rookie Kris Bryant, 11 months younger than Los Angeles Angels MVP Mike Trout, and just three months older than Washington Nationals phenom Bryce Harper.GALLERY: Top players under 25FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInBaseball\'s top players under 25\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.                                      3B Nolan Arenado, Rockies\xc2\xa0                                      Isaiah J.

He won\'t be the same player.\'""Well, you know what, I need to show the world that I\'m better than I\'ve ever been.\'\'It\'s this motivation, maybe this chip, that drives Machado to be the best third baseman in the game, putting him in the same conversation among the best young players in the game.""I think somewhere in the deep dark places of his mind, he sees that,\'\' said Orioles third base coach Bobby Dickerson, who has been with Machado since his professional arrival in 2010.

When they were in Baltimore last week, I just sat there watching him, seeing how he did all of his pre-game work, and how he went after balls.""It\'s the same with (Orioles shortstop) J.J. Hardy. All of my success defensively is because of him. He\'s taken my game to another level.\'\'Now, for the second time in three years, he\'s an All-Star again. Machado says he\'s humbled and honored his peers think so highly of him, voting him to the game. It\'s a reward for all of his hard rehab work recovering from surgery. If he had just one more wish, he would have loved for his mentor to join him at the All-Star Game, who also came back stronger than anyone envisioned.Yes, New York Yankees DH Alex Rodriguez, who despite the year-long 2014 suspension for performance-enhancing drug use, remains one of Machado\'s heroes.""He has always helped me and encouraged me so much,\'\' Machado says. ""He always gives me advice. He\'s treated me almost like a little brother. I\'ll always look up to him. For what he\'s done in this game, 3,000 hits, almost 700 homers, 2,000 RBI, it\'s just unbelievable.""I\'m proud of him and I know he\'s proud of me.\'\'Machado, who lives close in the offseason to Rodriguez in the South Florida, says they tease one another about who will hit the most homers. Machado, whose career-high was 13 before this season, leads by two entering Tuesday night\'s games. Still, no matter who ends up with the most, Machado realizes the ultimate prize is being on the team that represents the AL East in the playoffs.It stunk last year sitting in a hospital bed watching your teammates pour champagne over one another, Machado said, while he resorted to sipping champagne in his hospital bed. It was torture watching his teammates get swept by the Royals in the ALCS, losing two one-run games, and tied entering the ninth inning in two others.""Just seeing my teammates out there, and you not being able to do anything,\'\' Machado said, ""it just sucks. It was so tough to watch. It really makes you appreciate the game more. You don\'t take anything for granted because you realize that one day, it could all be gone.""If I go out there and break a leg, I\'ll break a leg. But you better believe I\'m going to leave it all on the field, every single night.""You go through what I did, and the journey to come back, and you realize just how much of a privilege it is to play this game.\'\'Lesson learned.GALLERY: AL All-Star startersFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn2015 American League All-Star starters\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore\'s bullpen has been the hardest to score against in the major leagues during the last 10 weeks. It took a rare stumble when Bud Norris faced the Minnesota Twins on Wednesday.Norris gave up three runs \xe2\x80\x94 including two homers \xe2\x80\x94 in the sixth inning, Chaz Roe allowed two more runs in the seventh and the Twins completed a three-game sweep with a 5-3 win over the Orioles.Manny Machado and Chris Davis hit back-to-back homers for Baltimore in the eighth inning, but Glen Perkins pitched a perfect ninth for the Twins for his 28th save in 28 attempts. The Orioles, who have lost six of their last seven games, combined for 10 runs in the six losses.""We\'re just not giving our pitchers much margin for error,"" Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said.Leading 1-0 in the sixth, Norris (2-9) walked Eric Fryer with one out, and Brian Dozier went deep for the team-leading 18th time this year to put the Twins in front. Joe Mauer followed with a full-count home run to left-center for a 3-1 lead.""Dozier\'s been swinging a real hot bat,"" Norris said. ""I still had two strikes in the count and I thought I had him the pitch before, but, unfortunately, he punished a mistake that I made. With Mauer, I left a 3-2 slider that he put a really good swing on.""From April 29 through Tuesday, the Orioles had the best relief ERA in the majors at 2.25.After going 15-8 with a 3.65 ERA in 28 starts last season, Norris was 2-7 with a 6.79 ERA in 11 starts this year before being sent to the bullpen last week. He also missed nearly a month with bronchitis.""I\'m just trying to get comfortable. It\'s going to be an adjustment period and I just want to do my part,"" Norris said. ""I feel bad about today. I don\'t want to let my team down. It\'s kind of tough to swallow.""Showalter said he thought Norris pitched well in his lone previous relief appearance Saturday, taking the loss after allowing an earned run in 2 2-3 innings at the Chicago White Sox.That\'s little consolation to Norris.""They\'ve all been frustrating as of late,"" he said.Minnesota starter Tommy Milone (5-1) stayed unbeaten in seven starts since being brought back from Triple-A Rochester at the beginning of June, striking out five in seven innings to lower his ERA to 2.84.Orioles starter Ubaldo Jimenez pitched five scoreless innings, but he needed a season-high 110 pitches to finish them.The Twins went 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position against Jimenez, who gave up seven hits and three walks while striking out five. Eddie Rosario ended innings in all three of his at-bats against the right-hander, striking out with the bases loaded, popping up with men at second and third and grounding out with runners at the corners.""It was very hard, but I got out of it. At the same time I got really tired,"" said Jimenez, who has allowed one run in 20 innings over his last three starts.TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles 1B Christian Walker, who was the DH, was recalled before the game from Triple-A Norfolk to take the roster spot of RHP Kevin Gausman, who went down for one start to keep the All-Star break from throwing him off schedule. Walker was then sent back to Norfolk after the game.

And while the O\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t do too many things right in last night\xe2\x80\x99s loss in Minneapolis, the fact is that all of the breaks went the other way. But to their credit, Minnesota took advantage of all of the breaks they were given in the game \xe2\x80\x93 be they mental blunders on the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 part, or just sheer luck.Kevin Gausman was unable to make it out of the fourth inning last night, and he seemed to lose his control towards the end of his outing. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 3.2 IP, 7 H, 8 R, 1 BB, 4 K. Now in fairness, several of those runs scored after Gausman had departed the game, however granted he\xe2\x80\x99s still responsible for the runners on base. It\xe2\x80\x99s very easy to look at this game and suggest that had someone else been pitching or had Gausman been on his game, the O\xe2\x80\x99s would have won 3-0. But those are the breaks.\xc2\xa0Live Feed kevin gausmanBaltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red Sox Call to the PenKevin Gausman ejected vs. Red Sox after hitting Xander Bogaerts (Video) FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck Showalter The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman is trying to get back on track The Baltimore WireAaron Judge crushes the hardest-hit ball in StatCast era (Video) FanSidedCourtesy of Jesse Johnson-USA TODAY SportsWhen things go south in a game quickly, it always starts innocently enough; Joe Mauer hit a one-out single in the last of the first. Gausman threw a wild pitch, and suddenly he\xe2\x80\x99s on second. Trevor Plouffe\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-double gave Minnesota the lead. That was followed by a two-run homer by Miguel Sano, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s trailed 3-0. MASN\xe2\x80\x99s Jim Palmer made a very valid point during the game in that Gausman wasn\xe2\x80\x99t using any of his off speed pitches for the most part. Minnesota seemed to not only recognize that as time went on, but they anticipated it. So they forced Gausman to throw the ball over the plate and to use his fastball; and when you can\xe2\x80\x99t mix a change up or breaking ball in there, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking for trouble.Mauer singled again in the last of the third, and strangely enough went to second on another Gausman wild pitch. After moving up on a groundout, he managed to score to give Minnesota a 4-0 lead on a passed ball by Matt Wieters. Unlike the first inning however, Gausman pitched out of the third. However if not for some unforeseen incident, none of those four runs would have scored \xe2\x80\x93 in theory. And again, you have to credit Minnesota for taking advantage of the breaks they were given. The Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t always able to do that, and on occasion they end up letting teams off the hook in a sense.Brian Dozier would add a sac fly-RBI in the fourth, and Gausman would exit after loading the bases by hitting Trevor Plouffe. That brought Sano back to the plate, and he took a walk from Brad Brach to run the score to 6-0. Rosario would add a two-RBI single to make it 8-0, however the Orioles got out of the inning by throwing out Sano trying to advance to third base.The only good news of the night for the Birds was that they did attempt to battle back just a bit. Travis Snider led off the fifth with a single, and he would later score on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s two-run homer. Going forward to the eighth, Minnesota once again caught a break. The line score says that Adam Jones tacked on an RBI-double to make it 8-3 \xe2\x80\x93 which was the final. However Jones sent a deep shot to center field, which probably would have been a homer in most parks. However the pitcher-friendly AL Central parks don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to take a liking to teams like the Orioles and their homer parade act; Jones\xe2\x80\x99 shot ticked off of the top of the wall and was ruled a double.This is not to say that the extra run would have meant anything, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would have. But momentum does matter, and a home run always adds momentum. However the fact is that the Orioles swing for the fences each at-bat. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily a problem, as that\xe2\x80\x99s the culture in which they play in the AL East. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always work in a park like Target Field or even US Cellular Field, where small ball is valued more.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

First baseman Christian Walker is expected to get the call-up today to join the Orioles, which is interesting to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fan of Gausman riding the Norfolk shuttle back and forth, however in this case I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it as a problem. The O\xe2\x80\x99s appear to now be committed to keeping him in the rotation so far as I can see, and even with games like last night\xe2\x80\x99s that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. But his turn in the rotation wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come up again before the all-star break. So this gives the Birds an extra bench player, and it gives Gausman the opportunity to make a start at triple-A during the break \xe2\x80\x93 in effect it keeps him throwing.The Orioles are also expected to make a roster move in the bullpen prior to this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game, and who that involves is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess. Wesley Wright needs to come off the 60-day DL, so he\xe2\x80\x99s my prediction. Time will tell. The Orioles will try to salvage a game in Minnesota in the series finale this afternoon.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsOn Friday night, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense was struggling as seems to be the normal at this point. But, home runs by Adam Jones and in the bottom of the ninth inning with two outs, Jonathan Schoop, helped lead the team to a 3-2 victory.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense continues to struggle. They team is currently abysmal with runners in scoring position. The pitchers are doing pretty well, the bullpen is doing well, but the offense just is struggling.Up until the eighth inning, Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 solo HR was about all the offense for the Orioles. Matt Wieters also had a good game, and he would be the one to tie the game on a double to the gap to score Chris Parmelee.I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it necessarily is the approach. The O\xe2\x80\x99s did a good job of working the count against Gio Gonzalez. They saw a lot of pitches, just were unable to put a lot of good swings on balls with two strikes.\xc2\xa0 There were also several at-bats where the batter struck out looking, as they were looking for the wrong pitch.But, once again the star of this game for the Orioles was their defense. The team turned several nifty double plays, with Jonathan Schoop the center of attention for most of them.

Maybe this is what it takes.\xc2\xa0 The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense should be one of the best in baseball. Sure, there are weakness, but this offense is a good one. They have been very streaky so far this season, however.The Orioles have done a good job against their interleague rivals over the last few years, and that continued to be the case.\xc2\xa0 The Nats have a bunch of injuries, but they are still leading their division.The O\xe2\x80\x99s also controlled Bryce Harper, who struck out in his first two at-bats, had a single against the shift, and then grounded out to the pitcher. The Orioles probably have better numbers as a pitching staff against Harper than anyone else. And when Wilson Ramos is batting fourth, it shows the importance of getting Harper out.The Orioles will remain second in the AL East with the win, as the Yankees won as well. In that game, Clay Buchholz left with an elbow injury. If he is lost for any amount of time, it will be a major blow for the Boston Red Sox.The Orioles will now have to face Jordan Zimmermann and Max Scherzer to end the first half of the season up to the All-Star break. Against two very good pitchers, the team will have to continue to maximize their opportunities on offense.Next: Looking at the O's close game statistics "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Walk off by Jonathan Schoop sinks DC', ""Last night\xe2\x80\x99s game between the Baltimore Orioles and Washington was the first back at Camden Yards for second baseman Jonathan Schoop since he came off the DL. And for nearly the entire game, Schoop and the Orioles had to watch as they were all but relegated to playing National League ball \xe2\x80\x93 against a National League team in their (the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99) ballpark. When I say they had to play National League ball, I mean that the games in the NL are much lower scoring in theory. This as opposed to the at times home run-happy American League.But as we know, things can change on the drop of a dime in baseball. Nevertheless, Chris Tillman pitched a very solid four innings before struggling in the fifth and sixth. However he put the Orioles in a position to win the game, which is all you can ask of your starter. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 8 H, 2 R, 1 BB, 6 K. Tillman hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost a game since May 31st, although he didn\xe2\x80\x99t figure into the decision last night. Tillman had his off speed and breaking pitches working well early, and speaking for myself I thought the two-strike curve to Bryce Harper in the first inning (which he swung through for strike three) was his best pitch of the night.\xc2\xa0Live Feed jonathan schoopBaltimore Orioles execute a weird triple play on Boston Red Sox FanSidedBaltimore Orioles Clicking on All Cylinders The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles Second Baseman Jonathan Schoop is Sizzling at the Plate The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: How long can one of the best infields in the league stay together?

But when the opposing team isn\xe2\x80\x99t yielding homers, it proves to be a challenge. And we saw the Orioles struggle again last night with runners on base. With Jones at the plate in the last of the third and Manny Machado on first, Machado was thrown out stealing to end the inning. That was unfortunate from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint, however it also meant that Jones would lead off the following inning for the Birds. And on the first pitch he saw Jones opened up his bat and smacked the thing out of the ballpark.However unfortunately for the Orioles, that 1-0 was never going to stand up for the entire night. And in fact it was very short-lived. In the fifth after two singles and a double-play, Washington had two outs and a runner at third. Tillman at that point started to struggle a bit with his command, and Tyler Moore smacked an RBI-double to tie the game. Michael A. Taylor would follow that up with an immediate RBI-single, and suddenly the Orioles were slowly bleeding to death as they trailed 2-1.Tillman got out of the inning unscathed from that point on, however it did dawn on me that the Orioles were losing in effect to an NL team who had taken over the game by playing the NL style of play \xe2\x80\x93 in an AL park. And as the game went on at a certain point Washington started counting outs. The O\xe2\x80\x99s could muster nary a base runner at certain points, which as the game went to the later innings made the bats start pressing a bit. But as can often be the case, it all started simply enough\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6Chris Parmelee pinch hit for Steve Pearce in the last of the eighth, and he reached on a swinging bunt down the third base line. Later in the inning with one down, Matt Wieters came to the plate \xe2\x80\x93 and Wieters gave the Orioles the surge of power for which they had looked all night. His RBI-double scored Parmelee from first and tied up the game. After the Birds sent Washington down 1-2-3 in the top of the ninth behind closer Zach Britton, we got to the real meat of the ballgame.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

He hammered that 2-2 pitch over the wall in left field, lifting the Orioles to an improbable 3-2 victory over Washington in the first leg of the Battle of the Beltways.

The defending AL East champions were in first place with a 41-34 record before the current slide.Coming off a six-game stretch in which they went 1 for 36 with runners in scoring position, the Orioles definitely need to escape the diamond.""I want these guys to get as far away from it as they can, take some pride in the way they\'ve competed and knowing that it\'s still there for them,"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""I think our best baseball is ahead of us.""Scherzer (10-7) allowed only three hits over the first eight innings and allowed only three base runners until Jones homered with two outs in the ninth.Drew Storen entered and struck out Chris Davis to earn his 27th save.Scherzer outpitched Chen (4-5), who gave up three runs and eight hits in a career-high tying eight innings.""He\'s a great pitcher and a player that I respect a lot,"" Chen, speaking through an interpreter, said of Scherzer. ""Watching him pitch, I learn a lot from him. Today, his pitching was just great.""Chen has a 2.78 ERA, but only four wins to show for it.""Wei-Yin\'s been solid for us,"" Showalter acknowledged.Scherzer was selected to the NL All-Star team, but he chose not to pitch in Tuesday\'s game. Though the right-hander certainly deserves a chance to show his stuff on the grand stage in Cincinnati, the Nationals gave him a $210 million, seven-year contract in January to help the team win the NL East and excel in the postseason.""He\'s a team guy,"" Washington\'s Dan Uggla said. ""There is never a doubt he wanted to pitch today, although I\'m sure he wanted to pitch in the All-Star Game. The team came first.""Scherzer has accounted for more than a fifth of first-place Washington\'s 48 wins, and his 2.11 ERA ranks among the league leaders.Yunel Escobar had three hits and scored a run for the Nationals, who won two of three from their neighboring rivals.This game started well for Baltimore, performing before a third straight sellout crowd at Camden Yards.With runners on second and third with two outs in the top of the first, Davis made a nice running catch of Wilson Ramos\' liner to right-center.Scherzer struck out the first two batters in the bottom half before Jones hit a 1-2 pitch into the seats in left field.Jones\' second homer was his 180th with the Orioles, pushing him past Frank Robinson into eighth place on the team\'s list.Washington used three straight two-out hits to take a 3-1 lead in the fourth. After singles by Escobar and Clint Robinson put runners on first and second, Uggla singled in a run and Tyler Moore followed with a two-run double.Scherzer made the lead stand up to avoid a third straight loss for the first time since May 2010.SERIES NOTESThe Orioles lead the series 36-32, including 23-14 at home. They meet for three games in Washington in September. The Nationals\' lone series win over a season came in 2007.TRAINER\'S ROOMNationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (oblique) won\'t return from his second stint on the DL unless he\'s close to 100 percent. ""He\'s healing up. Don\'t want to rush him,"" manager Matt Williams said.Orioles: Davis was back in the lineup after missing Saturday\'s game with a stomach virus.ON DECKNationals: Washington returns from the break Friday to launch a three-game series against the NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers.Orioles: Baltimore opens the second half with a nine-game road trip that begins Friday night in Detroit.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles headed into the All-Star Break 10 games above .500 last year. However, this season, they end the first half with a record of 44-44.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are fourth in the American League and fifth overall with 110 home runs headed into the break. They have four players with double-digit home runs. Chris Davis and Manny Machado lead the team with 19 each.

Wei-Yin Chen and Miguel Gonzalez lead the team with 17 each. The team as a whole has allowed 93 home runs to this point in the season.The MASN broadcasts have repeatedly said the O\xe2\x80\x99s score the majority of their runs via the long ball. Most of the time it is over 40% of their runs come from home runs. This stat is not necessarily a good thing.When the offense is struggling, home runs do not help when there are no runners on base. A perfect example is the last game of the half against the Washington Nationals. Max Scherzer pitched an excellent game, in which, he only allowed four hits along the way of recording 26 outs before the closer came on to record the last out. The Orioles are not hitting enough tw0 or three-run home runs. The solo shots are not helping the offense, but is hurting the team.The game ended in a 3-2 loss for the Birds, and how did they score those two runs? You probably guessed it: by the long ball.Adam Jones hit two solo shots out, and traditionally, a two home runs in a game would be a good thing. However, the O\xe2\x80\x99s offense is struggling, so they were unable to put any runners on base.An ace who has already pitched a no-hitter this season did not help the situation. Even against an excellent pitcher, home runs cannot help the offense if no one managed to make it on base. They do not necessarily have to be hits, but they could draw walks also.The Orioles are 13th in the AL in walks drawn. They are a very aggressive team, and in turn, they do not draw many walks.Their pitching has allowed the third most walks in the AL. Chen has helped minimize the home run damage by allowing 14 of his 17 when the bases are empty.Gonzalez has tried to minimize the damage also. Ten of his 17 home runs allowed were hit with the bases empty. However, five of them have been three-run bombs. When they say teams live and die by the home run, it is especially true for the Birds.

Solo shots are not going to win the AL East.The O\xe2\x80\x99s don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be turning away from the power game. Their offense is focused on the dingers, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t see them switching around the way they play to something similar to small ball.Of their 254 extra-base hits, 144 (minus the home runs) were either doubles or triples. In comparison, the top three in the AL in extra-base hits have more than 160 doubles and triples combined. Two of those teams are the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays.If the Orioles want to continue with their reliance on the home run, they have to increase their other extra-base hits. Otherwise, the Birds are going to be stuck with solo shots.Next: Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Decision to Bunt Critical in Loss ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles Hit Season Midpoint Tied For Third "" CBS Baltimore', ' BALTIMORE (WJZ) \xe2\x80\x94 It\xe2\x80\x99s the midway point for the Orioles.  The team reached the All Star break tied for third in the American League East. Jessica Kartalija has more on how fans feel about the Birds at this point in the season. Two home runs by Adam Jones weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough.  The Orioles lost another game to the Nationals Sunday, dropping to .500 as they head into the All Star break.

07/14/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Chances of a Better Second Half of 2015', 'May 26, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Chris Tillman (30) pitches during the first inning against the Houston Astros at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsIt is very difficult to not feel a good bit of disappointment in the first half of the 2015 season for the Baltimore Orioles. Just when it looked like they had turned it around with an 18-5 stretch, they did a face plant into the All-Star break with a 3-10 record \xe2\x80\x93 dropping from seven games above .500 to a perfect 44-44.The small amount of comfort to be taken from this mediocre performance is of course that only the Yankees are truly better off, and that being only four games. But it could be so different \xe2\x80\xa6 probably should be. More from Baltimore Orioles5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen workWhile the portion of the baseball world that finds interest in the midseason classic is watching it (which does not include me), I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about the second half and am wondering about the chances for the Orioles to truly have a turnaround. And there is a reasonable hope for that, a hope that can be considered both historically and in terms of personnel expectations. Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at each.Historical ConsiderationsSince Buck Showalter became manager of the Baltimore Orioles, the Orioles have had better second half records in three out of four seasons. Also, the Birds were 34-23 at the end of 2010 when he became the manager, and they were 37-37 in the second half (final record of 66-96). The only year that featured a poorer latter portion of the season was 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 much attributable to the bullpen meltdowns that plagued that squad.Here are the splits of records and win percentages over the recent past \xe2\x80\xa6YearBefore ASG.pct beforeAfter ASG.pct after201136-52.40933-41.446201245-40.52948-29.623201353-43.55232-34.485201452-42.55344-24.647201544-44.500??-??.???\xc2\xa0I think it is a generally true evaluation that Showalter and the Orioles have figured out as seasons progress how to maximize personnel and win a better percentage of games than in the earlier portion of each year. At the same time, it is really sad to look at the first half numbers of the previous three years to see that they were 5, 10, and 10 games over .500 \xe2\x80\xa6 which really makes this season look grim by comparison.Personnel ConsiderationsOne would have to expect that the quality of the players on the Orioles would lead to expectations of a better cumulative contributory performance. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to just sound like Buck, who puts a pretty face on things \xe2\x80\x93 not to be critical in saying that, I\xe2\x80\x99d do the same in his position. He recently reflected with the beat writers about the injured players who have now returned, along with his belief in the depth of the system.But thinking logically through this:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s ask ourselves how many of the Orioles players have lived up to expectations? And I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking about high-level, career-year performances \xe2\x80\xa6 just up to what you\xe2\x80\x99d hope from them in a solid year.Certainly there is Manny Machado. We would add Ubaldo Jimenez, Wei-Yin Chen, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Zach Britton to that list. It could be argued the Adam Jones is on it as well, or at least close to it. There have been surprisingly nice contributions from Chaz Roe and Jimmy Paredes \xe2\x80\x93 though the latter can disappear at times.But beyond that list, there is a lot of disappointment. Hopes were for Delmon Young and Alejandro De Aza to be regulars, but they are gone. Bud Norris and Chris Tillman would be on the hugely disappointing list \xe2\x80\xa6 and probably add Steve Pearce. We need to see more from J.J. Hardy, and Matt Wieters started well but has now cooled off. And certainly it would be great to get more out of Caleb Joseph, Travis Snider, Tommy Hunter, Brian Matusz, etc.\xc2\xa0 And Chris Davis is his own mixed bag of results.In an excellent article today, Steve Melewski of MASN stole my thunder before I could write about it \xe2\x80\x93 speaking of how (with statistical proof) that the Orioles are actually almost identical to 2014 in total offensive production (although, to be accurate, much of these big numbers came from a handful of big offensive games). The bigger issue has been the pitching, especially the starting pitching.All of this is to say that there are plenty of players who should perform better in the second half than there are those who are likely to cool off. But the rotation needs to replicate their second half of last year. Assuming that Jimenez and Chen can remain consistent, one would expect Gonzalez and especially Tillman to improve markedly. Add to this a healthy return of Kevin Gausman, and this could look like a different team entirely. Even as currently constructed, it should be the team to win the A.L. East; but the devil is in the details.We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue with more of these similar thoughts over the next couple of days.Next: Orioles have to win more close games\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Tough hours in Birdland - Birds Watcher', 'Next1 of 5Prev postUse your \xe2\x86\x90 \xe2\x86\x92 (arrows) to browseMany fans right now are harping on the fact that the Baltimore Orioles are only at .500 at the all-star break.

To make matters worse for the Orioles, <strong><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/www.baseball-reference.com\\/players\\/b\\/bogaexa01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-birdswatcher.com\\"" target=\\""_blank\\"" rel=\\""nofollow\\"">Xander Bogaerts<\\/a><\\/strong> homered in the top of the tenth to give Boston a 4-3 lead.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">However baseball rules tell us that the home team always gets the last at-bat. So in the last of the tenth <strong><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/www.baseball-reference.com\\/players\\/j\\/jonesad01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-birdswatcher.com\\"" target=\\""_blank\\"" rel=\\""nofollow\\"">Adam Jones<\\/a><\\/strong> put the crowd right back into things with a triple. He would later score on <strong><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/www.baseball-reference.com\\/players\\/d\\/davisch02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-birdswatcher.com\\"" target=\\""_blank\\"" rel=\\""nofollow\\"">Chris Davis<\\/a><\\/strong>&#8216; sac fly-RBI, and we were once again tied. That brought David Lough to the plate, and he provided his first ever walk off home run. The deep shot over the right field wall sent Camden Yards into a frenzy, and it gave the Orioles an improbable 5-4 win.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">This game is notable of course because it was played under heavy duress in the city of Baltimore. Tensions from the Freddie Gray death in the city began to boil over, as protesters converged onto the Camden Yards site &#8211; even before the game. Stores were looted, windows broken, and violence broke out. Quite frankly it&#8217;s a good thing that the game went to extra innings, as at one point the Baltimore City Police ordered all people at the game to remain in the ballpark until further notice. (By the time the game actually ended that order had been lifted.)<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">Through twitter and other social media, most of the fans in the ballpark were aware of what was going on outside. So this was a good moment for the city in a sense, because it gave Baltimore something to hang it&#8217;s hat on &#8211; the walk off win, that is. At the time we thought that might have been the worst of the tensions, however unfortunately that wasn&#8217;t to be the case. But the walk off home run capped off a tough evening for the city in a nice manner.\\u00a0<div class=\\""next-post lg slider\\""><a class=\\""location\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""next-post-shortcode\\"" href=\\""#\\""><span class=\\""next\\"">Next: <\\/span><span>The game with no fans<\\/span><\\/a><\\/div><\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\""><!\\u2014pageview_candidate\\u2014>""},{""title"":""Baltimore Orioles: Tough hours in Birdland"",""permalink"":""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2015\\/07\\/14\\/baltimore-orioles-tough-hours-in-birdland\\/3\\/"",""shortCodeTitle"":null,""content"":""<\\/p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div id=\\""attachment_42082\\""  class=\\""wp-caption aligncenter\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-chicago-white-sox-baltimore-orioles.jpg\\""><img class=\\""size-medium wp-image-42082\\"" src=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-chicago-white-sox-baltimore-orioles-300x600.jpg\\"" alt=\\""Courtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\\"" width=\\""300\\"" height=\\""200\\"" srcset=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-chicago-white-sox-baltimore-orioles-300x600.jpg 300w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-chicago-white-sox-baltimore-orioles-590x900.jpg 590w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-chicago-white-sox-baltimore-orioles.jpg 850w\\"" sizes=\\""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\"" \\/><\\/a>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\""fs-center-img\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\""wp-caption-text\\"" style=\\""width:300px;\\"">Courtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports<\\/p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\n<p style=\\""text-align: center\\""><strong>2) The game with no fans<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">The aforementioned walk off game gave us a one-day respite from what at that point was being called civil unrest. Sunday, April 26th came and went without incident. However Monday, April 27th brought us a much worse situation, as the violence re-commenced &#8211; and worsened at that. The situation became a full-scale riot at that time, canceling the Orioles&#8217; series-opener against the ChiSox, along with game two the next night. At this point both teams and the league were quickly looking for viable options to play games at all, as it became clear that Baltimore wasn&#8217;t an option.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">Games one and two of the ChiSox series were rescheduled as part of a doubleheader later in the year. However game three was played on it&#8217;s previously scheduled day, Wednesday, April 29th. The game was moved to an afternoon times slot given the fact that the city faced a curfew imposed by the mayor at night. There was also a twist to this game, never before seen in MLB circles: it was closed to the public. For the first time in league history, a game was played literally in front of no fans.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">This of course was done due to the fact that the police had to use their resources in other places due to the nature of what was going on in the city at that time, and public safety couldn&#8217;t be guaranteed. For the record, the Orioles defeated the ChiSox that day 8-2, at an eerily quiet Oriole Park at Camden Yards. But legions of fans gathered outside the ballpark gates in left field, peering into the game. In what became the personification of a community trying to take it&#8217;s city back, people stood there watching the game, listening on the radio, etc. It was almost like a big tailgate party during the game.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">During the national anthem, the players themselves shouted &#8220;O!&#8221; in a show of loyalty to the city. However they also heard that familiar yell from the fans gathered outside, and thus they knew that the people were with them. Throughout the game, the faint roar of those people was also audible on television. While the circumstances of not letting people into the stands was incredibly sad and unfortunate, it also gave us the image of Baltimore rising from the ashes like a Phoenix &#8211; by way of the people watching through the gates.\\u00a0<div class=\\""next-post lg slider\\""><a class=\\""location\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""next-post-shortcode\\"" href=\\""#\\""><span class=\\""next\\"">Next: <\\/span><span>Home games at the Trop<\\/span><\\/a><\\/div><\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\""><!\\u2014pageview_candidate\\u2014>""},{""title"":""Baltimore Orioles: Tough hours in Birdland"",""permalink"":""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2015\\/07\\/14\\/baltimore-orioles-tough-hours-in-birdland\\/4\\/"",""shortCodeTitle"":null,""content"":""<\\/p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div id=\\""attachment_42103\\""  class=\\""wp-caption aligncenter\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles.jpg\\""><img class=\\""size-medium wp-image-42103\\"" src=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles-300x600.jpg\\"" alt=\\""Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports\\"" width=\\""300\\"" height=\\""200\\"" srcset=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles-300x600.jpg 300w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles-590x900.jpg 590w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles.jpg 850w\\"" sizes=\\""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\"" \\/><\\/a>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\""fs-center-img\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\""wp-caption-text\\"" style=\\""width:300px;\\"">Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports<\\/p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\n<p><strong>3) Home games in Tampa<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>The 2015 riots in Baltimore didn&#8217;t only affect series&#8217; against the BoSox and ChiSox &#8211; the Orioles were supposed to close out that home stand over the weekend of May 1-3 with a visit from Tampa. However again, that series was unable to be played as originally scheduled due to the fact that there was a curfew in the city, and the police obviously had other concerns. There was a lot of talk of various contingencies, including playing Friday and Saturday&#8217;s games in the afternoon (along with Sunday&#8217;s previously scheduled day game), or potentially moving the series to either Washington or Philadelphia. (At the end of the day, apparently neither the Nationals or Phillies were contacted about using either ballpark.)<\\/p>\\n<p>So that weekend&#8217;s series ended up being played at Tampa&#8217;s Tropicana Field &#8211; with the Orioles classified as the home team. You can kind of look at it as an upside-down type of weekend in a sense; the games were played in Tampa&#8217;s home park, with the Orioles wearing their home whites (and Tampa their road grays), hitting last in the inning, and thus having the advantages of being at home &#8211; between the lines, that is. They also collected all of the gate and concessions revenue, after Tampa had covered their costs for producing the games.<\\/p>\\n<p>At the time, I thought this was the least of all evils. However I&#8217;ve rethought that just a bit. On one hand, it is very difficult to be overly critical given the circumstances. MLB, the Orioles, and the Tampa Rays had to come up with a solution very quickly to a bad situation. However if Washington wasn&#8217;t an option for whatever reason, what they could and should have done is moved the games to <strong><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/www.baseball-reference.com\\/player_search.cgi?results=smithed03,smithed05&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-birdswatcher.com\\"" target=\\""_blank\\"" rel=\\""nofollow\\"">Ed Smith<\\/a><\\/strong> Stadium in Sarasota &#8211; the spring home of the Orioles. This probably would have given the Orioles some semblance of home field advantage (given how Sarasota supports them), and it would have been a ballpark with which they were familiar in terms of it being their home field every spring. But again, it&#8217;s tough to be critical given the circumstances.<\\/p>\\n<p>But the fact that the O&#8217;s were on the field at all helped the city and community of Baltimore. They shone through in a time when the city needed any ounce of daylight it could muster, and the Orioles themselves really picked the city up when it was sorely needed. The fact that they took two-of-three from Tampa to close out the &#8220;home stand&#8221; didn&#8217;t hurt either.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\""next-post lg\\""><a class=\\""location\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""next-post-shortcode\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2015\\/07\\/10\\/baltimore-orioles-open-the-battle-of-the-beltways-vs-dc\\/\\""><span class=\\""next\\"">Next: <\\/span><span>Baltimore Orioles open the Battle of the Beltways vs. DC<\\/span><\\/a><\\/div>\\n<div class=\\""recent-posts-info\\""><h4>More from Birds Watcher<\\/h4><ul><li class=\\""recent\\""><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2017\\/02\\/20\\/baltimore-orioles-adding-vidal-nuno-helps-fill-bullpen\\/\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""recent-posts-shortcode\\"">Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen<\\/a><span class=\\""time-ago\\"">10w ago<\\/span><\\/li><li class=\\""recent\\""><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2017\\/02\\/20\\/baltimore-orioles-previewing-2017-season\\/\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""recent-posts-shortcode\\"">Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season<\\/a><span class=\\""time-ago\\"">10w ago<\\/span><\\/li><li class=\\""recent\\""><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2017\\/02\\/19\\/baltimore-orioles-manny-machado-and-os-have-not-discussed-extension\\/\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""recent-posts-shortcode\\"">Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O&#8217;s have not discussed extension<\\/a><span class=\\""time-ago\\"">11w ago<\\/span><\\/li><li class=\\""recent\\""><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2017\\/02\\/19\\/baltimore-orioles-os-receive-good-news-about-j-j-hardys-back\\/\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""recent-posts-shortcode\\"">Baltimore Orioles: O&#8217;s receive good news about J.J.

Having said that, it\xe2\x80\x99s also worth noting that with a few exceptions most teams are probably willing to part with\xc2\xa0almost anyone \xe2\x80\x93 if the price is right. In baseball as in all businesses, deals are based on what the return on investment could be. Keep in mind that when the Orioles acquired Davis from Texas, he along with Tommy Hunter came in a trade that sent Koji Uehara to Texas. A reliever for a pitcher and a power hitter is great return on investment.However in reading this article\xc2\xa0today by Dan Connolly of\xc2\xa0The Baltimore Sun, perhaps the people clamoring for Davis to be traded weren\xe2\x80\x99t so quick to judge after all. It appears that the Orioles have had internal discussions on whether or not they should keep Davis on the roster. Again, while I recognize that he\xe2\x80\x99s a pending free agent, to me it\xe2\x80\x99s a no-brainer that he stays. (The caveat is that if the O\xe2\x80\x99s fall flat on their face immediately out of the all-star break, I might consider it if I were Dan Duquette.)\xc2\xa0Live Feed chris davisBaltimore Orioles execute a weird triple play on Boston Red Sox FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Buck Showalter's Most Memorable Ejections The Baltimore WireWATCH: Chris Davis goes into Bo Jackson mode on bat FanSidedDraftKings Late MLB Picks For April 14 Fantasy CPRBaltimore Orioles: A hot start for Chris Davis could offset a trend of missed postseason appearances The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: How long can one of the best infields in the league stay together? The Baltimore WireAny trade scenario boils down to whether or not the player is worth more to the organization on the roster or on the trade market. In my personal opinion, he\xe2\x80\x99s worth more to the franchise on the roster. If theCourtesy of Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY SportsOrioles were floundering through a poor season and already playing out a string on the year, I might feel differently. But the AL East is a division that\xe2\x80\x99s very much the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 to lose in a sense, and trading Davis\xe2\x80\x99 threat of power would be incredibly narrow-minded from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint.The exception to that might be if they could yield a power-hitting outfielder in return. But the reason that teams make trades is to better themselves for the future. Davis might bring a return of a couple of prospects for the Orioles. While that would re-load the farm system a bit, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help them to win the division. And that\xe2\x80\x99s really the goal right now, is to repeat as AL East champions.Again, if things start going incredibly poorly out of the shoot for the Birds in the second half, I would expect this idea to be re-visited. But contending teams rarely break themselves up \xe2\x80\x93 in the middle of contending. And furthermore consider the fact that last year after Oakland thought they were being coy by moving Yoenis Cespedes, they had a horrendous second half and barely made it into the playoffs. That happening to the Orioles wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a given if they traded Chris Davis; however the point is that when you break up chemistry, you never know what can happen.\xc2\xa0More from Chris Davis7/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Davis sets up win in the twilight zone6/27 - Baltimore Orioles complete the sweep of Tampa6/14 - Will Chris Davis Continue His Impressive Home Run Streak?6/10 - Baltimore Orioles: Comeback kids led by Chris Davis6/1 - Baltimore Orioles: Fair is foul, foul is fairAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect example of a team possibly over-thinking things. They thought that they had enough offense, and that their playoff chances were still good even without Cespedes. Granted they still made the playoffs, but not in the manner that they had thought they would. With the ballpark in which they play, they thought that pitching would get them there \xe2\x80\x93 so they traded for John Lester. While Lester was good for them in the second half, that move sparked a tailspin.Connolly also makes valid points about the Orioles getting a supplemental pick in next year\xe2\x80\x99s draft if Davis declines a qualifying offer and then walks. So any return on the trade market would have to offset the fact that the Orioles would be losing Davis\xe2\x80\x99 services for the remainder of the year, AND they\xe2\x80\x99d potentially be losing a prospect in next year\xe2\x80\x99s draft. So there\xe2\x80\x99s more to it than meets the eye. If you still think the Birds should just move him to get something for him, then needless to say you want them to make a trade just for the sake of making a trade.Next: Baltimore Orioles open the Battle of the Beltways vs. DCMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAt the midseason point in Major League Baseball, the AL East is easily the most competitive division in baseball, with five teams separated by six and a half games.Today, I want to look at the weaknesses for each team at this point, going team by team according to the current standings.1 \xe2\x80\x93 New York Yankees \xe2\x80\x93 First \xe2\x80\x93 Middle Infield, RotationThe New York Yankees, despite their aging squad, have been one of the healthiest teams in the division. But, they do have weaknesses.The middle infield has been a black hole. Stephen Drew, the starting 2B, is hitting .182. He is probably about to lose his position to rookie Rob Refsnyder, who made two starts last weekend.

The NL roster also included some local guys as well, such as Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Bryce Harper and Max Scherzer.\xc2\xa0Neither Scherzer, nor Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day of the Orioles were able to get into the game last night. Scherzer\xe2\x80\x99s reason was very simple; he started on Sunday (against the O\xe2\x80\x99s, of course). However in O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s case it was a bit different.First off, I like the fact that every team has to be represented on the roster. A lot of people do not, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I might even understand the point that it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair for a token representative should be added from a team that\xe2\x80\x99s presumably out of the race, replacing someone who might deserve it more. However baseball is America\xe2\x80\x99s pastime, and in order for it to ensure that it always remains as such, sometimes it has to take it\xe2\x80\x99s fate into it\xe2\x80\x99s own hands.\xc2\xa0Live Feed manny machadoBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenManny Machado mashes ball over Green Monster (Video) FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red Sox Call to the PenChris Sale reportedly to be suspended by MLB FanSidedBoston Red Sox Attempt to Hit Manny Machado--Again Call to the PenManny Machado rips the Red Sox for throwing behind him in NSFW rant FanSidedIn saying that, I mean that I\xe2\x80\x99ve always felt that every fan has the right to sit down to watch the all-star game and to thus have a member of his home team on the roster. Philadelphia has the worst record in baseball right now; yet fans in that market were still able to watch the game knowing that one of their own, Jonathan Papelbon, was on the roster (similar to O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Papelbon didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear in the game \xe2\x80\x93 and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to that in a moment). If you want baseball to thrive everywhere from the perspective of fan attention, those are just the sacrifices you have to make.In contrast, the NBA and NHL do not require every team to be represented. Some people would say that they\xe2\x80\x99re thus true all-star games because the players in the game are actually the most deserving in a sense (no token additions, in other words). But ask yourself \xe2\x80\x93 are those sports\xe2\x80\x99 all-star celebrations as popular as MLB\xe2\x80\x99s?\xc2\xa0This is not to say that a very bad team can\xe2\x80\x99t have an all-star, because they can. But if the team from your town is flailing in the wind and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have an all-star in the game, what incentive do you have to watch the game?The all-star game in any sport certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t everything, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something. The idea is that it showcases the best your sport has to offer. I would submit that it also keeps interest fresh, especially among young people. So that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing that MLB (and the NFL) requires each team to be represented. This is just my view \xe2\x80\x93 feel free to disagree.However there were also players, such as the aforementioned Jonathan Papelbon and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99day, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into the game at all. I would submit that if you\xe2\x80\x99re on the roster, you should play in the game (barring injury). Some folks might say that the game is just an exhibition (that decides home field advantage in the World Series), however athletes look at this as an honor. Furthermore to piggyback on what I said above, fans should be able to see their guy in the game and thus know he participated and added something in some way.I suppose that if I were a Phillies fans I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really be happy at knowing that my lone representative didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into the game. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly grant you that with the game now having stakes, managers might tend to take it a bit more seriously in the sense that they might not choose to change pitchers after every at-bat in the name of getting someone into the game. But again, this game is for the fans. It\xe2\x80\x99s not unreasonable for a fan to expect his team to be represented both on the roster and in the game.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerSome folks are going to disagree with this, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. This is just how I see things. One might argue,\xc2\xa0if it\xe2\x80\x99s an exhibition for the fans, why should a token player replace a true all star just so his team is represented?\xc2\xa0And that might well be a fair question to ask. But I would remind people that no system is perfect.In that vain, keep in mind that as a society we now try to find the perfect system in anything and everything. And for the most part there\xe2\x80\x99s always going to be a hole somewhere in every solution. Yes, a more deserving player might miss out on the festivities so that a Philadelphia Phillie or Milwaukee Brewer can be added to the roster. That\xe2\x80\x99s just how the ball bounces sometimes. But as I said, that keeps interest in markets that perhaps have a struggling team at that moment, and thus it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the game. And keep in mind\xe2\x80\xa6Baltimore was that market for a long period of time.Orioles update: As last night\xe2\x80\x99s all-star game was getting underway, the Orioles made a roster move. They designated Wesley Wright\xc2\xa0for assignment, removing him from the roster. If he clears waivers and isn\xe2\x80\x99t traded, he\xe2\x80\x99ll either have the option of accepting a minor league assignment with the O\xe2\x80\x99s or becoming a free agent.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado among others key in AL winMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Entering the season with a roster looking primed to challenge for a championship and playing in a division that looked weak and unstable, it looked as if another division championship was almost a foregone conclusion.However, inconsistent play in every aspect of the game and a myriad of injuries have left the Orioles with a .500 record at the halfway point. \xc2\xa0On the bright side, even with their disappointing record, the Orioles are still easily within reach of contention, and the Orioles have had strong second-halves in almost every season since Buck Showalter has taken over.

Kevin Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s role, or lack thereof, has been a constant source of distain among Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans ever since he broke into the league. In the past, he has just been the victim of the roster crunch. There were just too many established pitchers playing well already on the roster.This is no longer the case. With incumbents Bud Norris and Chris Tillman having horrific seasons thus far, the Orioles will need Gausman to solidify the back of the rotation if they want to make a playoff run.

On the one hand, the amount of pending free agents could leave the Orioles with an abundance of production lost next season. However, on the other hand, the Orioles are in a position to contend this season, and contending this season always takes priority.At the moment, the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t have the MLB-ready production in the minors to deal any veterans that could leave after the season. Also, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have an over-stock of prospects to deal for any superstar level players, especially if those prospects could be used to fill the gaps left next season.Dan Duquette, as he always does, will search the market for cheap and unique options for production, but fans waiting for the blockbuster move will probably be disappointed.Mike Wright will become a force in the bullpen: Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans caught a slight glimpse of who Mike Wright was with his first two electrifying starts. However, like many young players, the league adjusted and Wright was shuttled back to AAA to harness his talent.However, stuff is obviously not an issue. With a fastball that topped in the high 90s, Wright has the arm to be strong rotation candidate next season. However, until his raw secondary stuff is polished getting big league hitters out for multiply innings will be a struggle. Yet, that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hinder the Orioles from using his talent. As a late inning flame-thrower, Wright should be used to further solidify an already solid bullpen.The Orioles will win the AL East: With a close look at the rosters in the division, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a stretch to say the Orioles are disappointed to be where they currently are. After watching the first half, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to predict any consistency for the team. However, eventually one would have to believe the best team will win, and the Orioles are the best team. It will be close, but the Orioles should pull away by the end.More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Matt Wieters (along with Chris Davis, Bud Norris, and other pending free agents) aren\xe2\x80\x99t worth very much on the trade block this year. As pending free agents, another team would be acquiring him in a rental capacity in a sense \xe2\x80\x93 similar to what the Orioles did last year with Andrew Miller.

07/17/2015,"[('Orioles Look To Start 2nd Half Strong Vs. Detroit \\xab CBS ...', ' (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Detroit Tigers have been a postseason fixture in recent years, but they might be in no man\xe2\x80\x99s land between buying and selling ahead of this year\xe2\x80\x99s deadline. In a weaker division, the Baltimore Orioles are right in the thick of the playoff race despite being just as inconsistent. These teams open a three-game series Friday night in Detroit in their first meeting since last season\xe2\x80\x99s AL division series. Over the past few years, baseball\xe2\x80\x99s trade deadline has been a source of excitement and anticipation in Detroit. Now, with the deadline approaching again, general manager Dave Dombrowski is facing questions about his team\xe2\x80\x99s short-term goals. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re trying to win this year right now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said recently. The fact that Dombrowski had to reaffirm that philosophy was telling. The Tigers entered the All-Star break at 44-44, in third place and nine games out of first in the AL Central. Baltimore (44-44) is four games behind the first-place New York Yankees in the AL East despite the same record. The Tigers are tied with St. Louis for baseball\xe2\x80\x99s longest active postseason appearance streak after four straight division titles, but its deficit in the standings has spurred speculation that the team might be better off trading some of its top players and reshaping the roster for next year. That talk may be premature. The Tigers are certainly still in contention for a wild card. At the very least, they can wait a little longer before evaluating what their next moves might be. But so far this year, Detroit has looked average, and Miguel Cabrera isn\xe2\x80\x99t expected to return from a strained calf until next month. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to get on a roll and the only way to do that is with good starting pitching,\xe2\x80\x9d Dombrowski said. After losing five of six meetings in the 2014 regular season, the Orioles swept the Tigers in the division series, including a 2-1 victory at Comerica Park on Oct. 5. Anibal Sanchez (8-7, 4.63 ERA) worked out of the bullpen in that series, tossing two scoreless innings in Game 2 in his only appearance. Sanchez owns his highest ERA since 2008, but he\xe2\x80\x99s 5-0 with a 2.84 ERA over his last six outings. He\xe2\x80\x99s averaged 6.3 runs of support in that span. Baltimore staggered into the All-Star break on level ground following a wild roller-coaster ride marred by erratic play, with losses in 10 of its last 13. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been up and down,\xe2\x80\x9d shortstop J.J. Hardy said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had some good stretches and some bad stretches, yet we\xe2\x80\x99re still kind of right in the mix. So if we can get going in the second half, we have a good chance.\xe2\x80\x9d As the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline approaches, general manager Dan Duquette sees the Orioles as buyers, just like last year when they secured standout reliever Andrew Miller for a postseason run that finally ended in the ALCS. Though the contracts of Matt Wieters, slugger Chris Davis and left-hander Wei-Yin Chen are among those that expire after this season, Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s focus is in the short term. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d like to make our team as strong as we can for the rest of the season,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe division is wide open. No dominant team has emerged and there will be a lot of teams vying for the wild-card spots, too.\xe2\x80\x9d All-Stars Manny Machado, Zach Britton, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Adam Jones excelled in the first half, as did newcomer Jimmy Paredes, who\xe2\x80\x99s batting .299 and already has reached career highs with 10 homers and 39 RBIs. Hardy is back in a groove after being sidelined by back spasms; Wieters and Jonathan Schoop contributed immediately upon their return from the disabled list; and Kevin Gausman is back in the rotation after a bout with right shoulder tendinitis. \xe2\x80\x9cI think our best baseball is ahead of us,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Buck Showalter said. Ubaldo Jimenez (7-4, 2.81) looked particularly good just before the break, recording a 0.45 ERA over his last three outings. He\xe2\x80\x99s trying to shake a rough history in Detroit, where he\xe2\x80\x99s 2-7 with a 6.80 ERA in nine career outings.

Mandatory Credit: Jesse Johnson-USA TODAY SportsLately for Baltimore Orioles right fielder Chris Davis, if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for bad luck, he\xe2\x80\x99d have no luck at all!The second half of the season opened poorly for him in Detroit on Friday night. Though he made a series of very fine catches in the outfield, his adventures at the plate were difficult.Davis did get a single in the second inning and score; and later he registered a RBI on a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice. But once again he was robbed at the wall by an outfielder \xe2\x80\x93 just as he was twice recently against the White Sox. He also hit a screaming line drive into the shift that doubled Adam Jones off first base.But the biggest indignity was getting called out in the top of the ninth inning on a 3-2 pitch with two runners on base and one out. As we all know too well, Davis can strike out at a rate that is epic. But on this occasion, the ball was a full six inches outside. A simply terrible and deadly call at that point of the game! One more out, and the Orioles were on the losing end of a 7-3 score.

The suggestion here is not that the Orioles should have won the game except for the bad luck that struck them. No, even though they outhit the Tigers 10-8, Detroit put together the big hits with three long balls off an ineffective Ubaldo Jimenez.At the same time, the Orioles were a mere 1-for-14 with runners in scoring position. This is the identical problem that doomed them in the final stretch before the All-Star break.This cannot continue as it is. And I do not think that it will. Manny Machado is hitting well, and Adam Jones looks to be back on the ball. Jonathan Schoop is looking decent, as is J.J. Hardy. Chris Davis is in a much better place than early in the season, and Jimmy Paredes is going to get hits and make things happen. One would expect Matt Wieters to pop out of a recent slump and get back into a groove, and he had two hits in this series opener.The problem \xe2\x80\xa6 the hole in the lineup \xe2\x80\xa6 is what to do about the current left field and first base situation. Travis Snider and Chris Parmelee are simply not getting it done. They were a combined 0-for-7, which is about what they have been doing for a while now.The answer is not a simple one. Even Ryan Flaherty looks to be a better option \xe2\x80\xa6 can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I just wrote that! Even David Lough might provide more offense, and surely better defense.But certainly it is time to put Nolan Reimold out there on a daily basis. Right now there is too much concern (given the left-handed nature of the players being discussed) to put Snider and Parmelee in the lineup against all the right-handers. Nolan actually splits well against righties, batting only at a slightly lower number than against lefties, but also with an identical L/R OBP of .331. That is a good number; that is the team number the Tigers have right now \xe2\x80\x93 a number that is the best in baseball.The other issue with Reimold is that he needs to play on a rather daily basis to be in a groove and produce well. And it is time to do that. Put his OBP in the two hole behind Machado, and then drop Paredes to the sixth or seventh spot. That would work and put the Orioles in a better place than they are right now.Next: Orioles Midseason MusingsMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore44m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

The Baltimore WireBlue Jays Easter Optimism Jays JournalI recall noticing in that second half of 2012 that Tillman was locating his off speed pitches much better in the zone. And this is usually the case with your quality power pitchers in that they start being able to throw change ups and breaking balls, which really fools hitters. In last night\xe2\x80\x99s game we also saw this in the beginning from Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s David Price, who put several Orioles out with sweeping curve balls low and away.If you look back on several poor starts by other Oriole starters this year, you\xe2\x80\x99llCourtesy\xc2\xa0Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsnotice that opposing teams literally forced the pitcher to utilize their fastball. And by that I mean on almost every pitch. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you neutralize a pitcher who\xe2\x80\x99s got a great fastball; the only chance he has is to strike the hitter out everytime given the fact that the hitter already knows what\xe2\x80\x99s coming.But if a pitcher is able to mix in a change up or curve ball like Tillman was doing last night, he\xe2\x80\x99s really going to find himself in business. The Detroit hitters had no idea what was coming each time. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how you fool hitters \xe2\x80\x93 if you get them guessing on what\xe2\x80\x99s coming next, you\xe2\x80\x99ve just turned the tables.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerThis is not to say that Tillman or any other pitcher is unhittable.

When hitters are allowed to force pitchers to throw their fastball and only their fastball, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be on their toes.So the point is to take it easy in a sense.

And until Caleb Joseph squeaked a soft liner into short center to score the insurance runs with two outs in the ninth, the O\xe2\x80\x99s were 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position.

Schoop has now appeared in 160.Clearly Machado has broken through this year to become, as hoped, one of the very best players in the sport. He is currently the number five ranking player in all of baseball in terms of the WAR statistic (5.2) \xe2\x80\x93 ahead of even such as Max Scherzer and Josh Donaldson.So, could Schoop be on the verge of a similar breakthrough? My own opinion on this is that if he is not ready to do so right now, that time is not terribly far away. He is going to be a streaky player, just like most others on the Orioles. But I believe Schoop has greater talent than almost all of the others who are up and down in performance to be able to learn the necessary adjustments as his experience grows.This much is for sure: the mechanics of his swing are about as good as anyone, anywhere. He snaps the head of the bat on the ball with great timing and authority, and the ball often seems to explode off the lumber.He will be a free-swinger, perhaps not quite as much as Adam Jones, but enough to tally some strikeouts. But even with this, he has so far this year cut it down to about 20%, dropping from 25%.Together with Machado, this is a great tandem for Orioles fans to enjoy over at least the next handful of years.Next: Tillman shows dominance ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles and Runners in Scoring Position', 'The Baltimore Orioles busted out of a team-wide slump with runners in scoring position on Sunday, en route to a 9-3 victory over the Detroit Tigers.

HeCourtesy of Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sportsobviously played for some time in Atlanta as well \xe2\x80\x93 another pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s park. But if you put him in a park like Camden Yards, I think his numbers would be much higher. The risk for the Orioles of course is that Upton\xe2\x80\x99s in a contract year, so his services are only guaranteed throughout the remainder of the 2015 season.Again, according to MLB Trade Rumors, the Birds are also interested in Carlos Gomez of Milwaukee. While Gomez is only hitting .268 on the year, it\xe2\x80\x99s a similar situation given the fact that he plays at Miller Park which favors hitters. Let me be clear, Gomez is a great player and his skill set would be welcomed by the Orioles as things stand now. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one problem\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6whether or not his personality would mesh well is another story. Gomez has a reputation for being somewhat brash at times. Whether or not he would be someone that would fit into the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse would remain to be seen. He\xe2\x80\x99s a great talent, and he has blazing speed on the base paths. But would he spoil an atmosphere of togetherness and unity that exists within the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 operation?Some people are going to say that\xe2\x80\x99s a weak argument for not acquiring a player that could help the team. And perhaps it is for all I know. The Orioles have had \xe2\x80\x9cissues\xe2\x80\x9d in the past, most notably last season in the Machado/Donaldson incident. However I think that was more of a momentary lapse in judgement on Machado\xe2\x80\x99s part, and it was handled in house by some of the veterans on the team. However would they be able to reign in a guy like Gomez, or would it cause a rift in the clubhouse?These are all questions that one has to ask when talking about trades and player acquisitions. Incidentally, on the flip side Gomez would have one big advantage over Upton: he\xe2\x80\x99s under team control until after the 2017 season. As I said above, Upton is a free agent after this season is up.However both for the attitude that would come with Gomez as well as the contract situation, I would go with Upton if I were Dan Duquette looking to trade for one of those two. First off, Upton is going to come cheaper\xc2\xa0because of the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s a free agent after the season is over. However the Orioles also have Dariel Alvarez, who\xe2\x80\x99s gaining seasoning in the minors right now. Since Markakis left, I believe he\xe2\x80\x99s always been thought of as the long-term solution in right field.\xc2\xa0More from Rumors1/18 - Baltimore Orioles: Should the Orioles Resign Mark Trumbo?

Then Alvarez could potentially get a \xc2\xa0September call-up, and thus immediately begin the process of getting used to playing at the big league level. Depending on how he looks in Spring Training next year, he could then be the starting right fielder in 2016. (Incidentally this scenario could also play out with Carlos Gomez if the Birds traded for him.)Regardless of whether or not Upton or Gomez is a serious target, price is something that has to be considered. Do the O\xe2\x80\x99s have the necessary pieces to send out in exchange for someone like either one of them? One alternative to the Upton/Alvarez scenario above might be for the Orioles to work out a\xc2\xa0sign-and trade deal with San Diego in the sense that they could sign Upton to an extension and immediately trade him to the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 for Dariel Alvarez.Many people are going to read that and say that the Birds would be depleting their farm system if they did that. However keep in mind that they also have quite a few notable pending free agents this upcoming winter. All of them are expected to receive qualifying offers, which means that unless some or all of them end up staying with the Orioles, the Birds will get supplemental draft picks next year.Certainly the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t draft guys like Dariel Alvarez or anyone else in the minor leagues with the purpose of trading them. However given the state of the AL East, it\xe2\x80\x99s anyone\xe2\x80\x99s division. One nip here and a tuck there might put someone over the top in terms of winning the division.

If so, who are you trading? Kevin Gausman? Hunter Harvey?One baseball writer says the Orioles, with the injuries to Hunter Harvey and Dylan Bundy, have the worst farm system in baseball. I\xe2\x80\x99d say it is hard to disagree with that.Sure, the Orioles have been winning across their minor league affiliates this year. But the talent is not the same as what other organizations have. Especially when it comes to position players.Bundy at this point is a high draft choice who may never make it anywhere, sadly. Gausman is unproven, as is Harvey, who has also dealt with injury issues.Tyler Wilson and Mike Wright are not great trade chips.That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t have some players that will likely be good major leaguers.

The Orioles clearly are getting things done, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the same way that some other major league teams are doing it.I think the O\xe2\x80\x99s will make at least a few moves at the deadline. On Wednesday, they have to make a move to get Kevin Gausman in the rotation. My guess is that either Ryan Flaherty will be sent down, since he has options, or that Chris Parmelee will be designated for assignment.I also think that a trade out of the bullpen could be coming. Maybe Brian Matusz, maybe Tommy Hunter.However, there is precedent to the Orioles making a significant deal around the deadline recently. In 2011, Koji Uehara was traded to the Texas Rangers for Tommy Hunter and Chris Davis. They also traded Mike Gonzalez to the Rangers after the non-waiver deadline in August, getting Pedro Strop in return.

They also waited until after the non-waiver deadline and acquired Joe Saunders from the Arizona Diamondbacks for Matt Lindstrom. Saunders would go on to be one of the team\xe2\x80\x99s starters in the playoffs, including starting the first ever AL Wild Card game.In 2013, the Orioles made deadline deals for pitching, bringing in Bud Norris for L.J. Hoes, Josh Hader and a competitive pick. They also traded Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop for Scott Feldman and Steve Clevenger. Both of those trades don\xe2\x80\x99t look very good at this point, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t second guess either of them.The Birds also traded Nick Delmonico to the Milwaukee Brewers for Francisco Rodriguez, who did not fill the closer role the way the team expected.Xavier Avery was also traded at the end of August for Michael Morse. That didn\xe2\x80\x99t go well either.In 2014, the team traded Eduardo Rodriguez to the Boston Red Sox for Andrew Miller at the last second of the trade deadline. This move paid big dividends, as Miller was absolutely spectacular down the stretch.Two other deals were made at the end of August, trading Mark Blackmar and Miguel Chalas to the Chicago White Sox for Alejandro De Aza. Also, the O\xe2\x80\x99s traded Ivan De Jesus and Jemile Weeks to the Boston Red Sox for Michael Almanzar and Kelly Johnson.Look back at these deals. Of the minor leaguers the O\xe2\x80\x99s traded, only Rodriguez has really had an impact on the major leaguers. However, out of all the players traded for only Chris Davis, Tommy Hunter and Bud Norris are in the major leagues for the Birds.The last point I want to make is the moves made in the even years, 2012 and 2014, in hindsight look much better than those made in odd years.Maybe based on that alone, the Orioles should stay put at the trade deadline this year.Next: The O's and RISPMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore44m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Will the Birds see Trey Mancini?', 'We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard all about Christian Walker with regard to potential future first basemen for the Baltimore Orioles; but what about Trey Mancini?

That\xe2\x80\x99s just one scenario mind you, but again it\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting that Showalter went to the trouble of dropping Mancini\xe2\x80\x99s name like that.

"", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: 20 Outs is all You Get with the Yankees', 'Jul 21, 2015; Bronx, NY, USA; Rain clouds move in during the second inning between the New York Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsWhen pitching coach Leo Mazzone was with the Baltimore Orioles some years ago, he would speak of attempting to get starters to think in terms of getting 20 outs \xe2\x80\x93 going 6 and 2/3 innings. If done with some consistency, this saves the bullpen from overuse and allows for a couple of dominant relievers to essentially shut down the opposition from that point forward.Particularly in the 2014 season, we saw where teams with two, or even three, highly effective relievers were able to contribute mightily toward a team\xe2\x80\x99s success. We might particularly point to the Royals in this regard, and it is fair to include the Orioles in that discussion. I believe this line of thinking and team construction is more than a current fad, rather it is a timeless way of constructing a roster \xe2\x80\x93 weighing heavily also upon the distribution of available dollars.And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve written a handful of times since the end of last season, I would have rather seen the Orioles spend whatever it took to keep Andrew Miller than Nelson Cruz or Nick Markakis \xe2\x80\x93 especially if we are talking about four-year deals and not just 2015.OK, yes, I can hear some of you screaming one of two things, or maybe even both!\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cBut the Orioles did not spend to keep even one of those three!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Or, \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t have Miller, because if you can\xe2\x80\x99t score any more than two runs in your first 20 outs of the game, it is irrelevant as to who you have in the bullpen most nights.\xe2\x80\x9dThese things are true. But my point is not to say that the Orioles would be five games ahead of the Yankees instead of five games behind if only they had kept Miller. The back end of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 relief corps is arguably nearly as good as what the Yankees have going on with Dellin Betances and Miller. And frankly, this Orioles roster should be scoring more runs than they are, even without whatever Cruz and Markakis would have brought to it. They should be good enough to be among the best in the league. They are not getting it done. Duquette and Angeles can\xe2\x80\x99t hit the ball for them.

Add to this this that their offense has produced better than could have been reasonably expected when analyzed in March, and boom \xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99re five games ahead of the O\xe2\x80\x99s.Here are the amazing numbers \xe2\x80\xa6 the Yankees, who managed to have a lead going into the eighth inning, are 49-0 this year in those scenarios. At the same time, the Orioles are 42-0 in the same situation. The difference, obviously, is that the NY offense has given their back end of the pen that situation seven more times. Andrew Miller is 21-for-21 in save situations.I\xe2\x80\x99ve also written before and often said that I think the very best arm in all of baseball is Dellin Betances. It is almost unfair what he can do with his varied pitches. He can throw a moving fastball at 99 and follow it with a tight breaking pitch at 82 \xe2\x80\xa6 and everything in between.Add in the Orioles relievers of Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Zach Britton, and you are talking about four terrific bullpen arms.

07/24/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Down on the farm - Birds Watcher', 'With the Baltimore Orioles struggling right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that some folks in their minor league system are thriving. Down the road in Frederick, the Keys have won two straight games from their Carolina League rivals, Potomac Nationals. The Keys defeated Potomac 3-1 last night at Pfitzner Stadium in Woodbridge, VA.First off it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting how minor league baseball has evolved a bit. Growing up in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s and \xe2\x80\x9990\xe2\x80\x99s, my Dad didn\xe2\x80\x99t take us to very many minor league baseball games. We had the Keys and the Alexandria Dukes (in Alexandria, VA), who later moved down the pike and became the Prince William Cannons \xe2\x80\x93 now the Potomac Nationals. But with the Orioles playing at Memorial Stadium and later Camden Yards, we never had a reason to go to minor league games.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue Call to the PenPhoto: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY SportsHowever at that time the Keys (and later the Bowie Baysox) were a bit of an anamoly. Very few big league clubs had farm teams within striking distance of the big league club. Heck the Dukes/Cannons/Nationals revolved around; at varying points they were part of the ChiSox and Pirates\xe2\x80\x99 farm systems. However now it seems that there\xe2\x80\x99s more of an emphasis on having your farm teams close by, which especially helps a team like the Orioles who fully utilizes it\xe2\x80\x99s 40-man roster.The Keys\xe2\x80\x99 left fielder Jay Gonzalez is a fairly solid prospect, going 1-for-5 in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game. The Keys also got two hits (including a home run) out of Chance Sisco, their catcher. The game went to the ninth inning tied at one, but Frederick scored on a wild pitch by the Potomac pitcher, and later in the inning Tanner Witt squeezed a run home on a sac bunt. For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth the Washington Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 top pitching prospect, Lucas Giolito, started the game for Potomac, pitching six innings. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s third baseman, Anthony Rendon, was also guarding the hot corner for Potomac \xe2\x80\x93 in a rehab assignment.Keep in mind that the Keys are Class A ball; so these prospects might not see the field at Oriole Park at Camden Yards for some time. You do have some prospects (Manny Machado, for instance) who are fast tracked to the big leagues. But for most of these guys it takes some time \xe2\x80\x93 if they make it at all. Incidentally while this was technically a road game for the Keys, I\xe2\x80\x99d highly recommend making the trek out to Harry Grove Stadium in Frederick if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been. It\xe2\x80\x99s great family entertainment at very affordable prices.

There is still a lot of baseball to be played \xe2\x80\x93 68 games, to be exact.But the Orioles are now seven games behind the Yankees. And though they are technically now in fourth place, the Jays and Rays are right there with them.Speaking of the Rays, the Orioles begin a three-game series with them this evening. And the Orioles need to start a winning streak; they need it desperately before more time passes. This hole they are in can be exited, but little time remains to get it together and make it happen.Reflecting on the Butt Kicking Just ReceivedThere is not much to say or explain about the butt kicking that the O\xe2\x80\x99s received from the Yankees. They were simply beaten in just about every way. We all have to live around Yankees fans, and it is embarrassing. The licking in this series is what the Birds have been doing to New York in the past couple of years.

Unfortunately, only six runs were scored on the five long balls.The Yankees outscored the Orioles 16-8. For the series, New York was 31-for-99 (.313) but Baltimore was merely 16-for-93 (.172) \xe2\x80\xa6 yes, only 16 hits in 27 innings!The O\xe2\x80\x99s did not have many baserunners overall, let alone runners in scoring position; so they were a total of 2-for-14 in RISP situations.The first two games were at least reasonably well-pitched by the Orioles, but overall their ERA for the series was 6.00, while the Yankees were 2.67Taming Tampa BayThe Rays are a team the Orioles should pound, but that could be said about most teams. They just aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing it.The O\xe2\x80\x99s need Chris Tillman to step up like never before. The old Ubaldo Jimenez returned to the mound on Thursday afternoon, so now the old Tillman needs to show up. He takes his 7-7, 4.96 record into the game, though he is 3-1 over his past four outings with a 1.40 ERA.The Orioles also need some hitters to group some base hits off Chris Archer.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles desperately need to do some things they have not been doing lately and get a win that will start a new winning trend. But in the 3-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays on Friday night, the new thing done was not in a category that was helpful.Prior to this game, the Orioles were a perfect 39-0 when leading after seven innings. And after seven frames on Friday night, the O\xe2\x80\x99s were winning 1-0.Chris Tillman was pitching a beautiful game, having only given up two hits, with two walks and a hit batsman. He had only thrown 85 pitches.Leading off the bottom of the eighth for the Rays was Kevin Kiermaier, and Tillman walked him on a full count, putting the tying run on first base. And out comes Buck Showalter, calling for Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day to enter the game. More from Baltimore Orioles5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen workShowalter will not let a starting pitcher who has had a good outing and is in the lead late in the game face a situation where he might become the losing pitcher. In this case, there was no way Buck was going to allow Tillman to put another runner on base and become the loser. I will bet anything that Showalter would have permitted Tillman to face another batter if the score was 2-0 instead of 1-0.Of course, there is every reason to have confidence in Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, who has truly been great over the past month or so. But after getting an out, O\xe2\x80\x99Day simply did not hold Kiermaier closely enough on first base, and the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 center fielder stole second base. There he was for John Jaso to drive the first pitch he saw from O\xe2\x80\x99Day into center for an RBI single. The inning continued and featured a fluke hit by Evan Longoria on a broken bat, and before it was over, the score was 3-1 \xe2\x80\xa6 the final.You can say that it was again some bad luck that hurt the Orioles in that eighth inning. But, when a team only scores one run, you can\xe2\x80\x99t blame the pitching for not shutting out the opponent and thereby at fault for blowing the game. O\xe2\x80\x99Day can\xe2\x80\x99t be perfect every night, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been very, very good in most games.Again, the Orioles did not get many baserunners in scoring position \xe2\x80\x93 only a total of seven. And the O\xe2\x80\x99s only managed one hit in those situations, making them 3-for-21 during this four-game losing streak.In the category of good news, it certainly appears that Chris Tillman has found his former good stuff and old form. That is great. Now we need to hope that Jimenez has not regressed at the same rate. And we need to hope that Kevin Gausman settles in. And we need to hope that Miguel Gonzalez regains his historic consistency. And we need to hope that Wei-Yin Chen continues his very good season by keeping the fly balls on the fielders\xe2\x80\x99 side of the walls. And we need to hope that the offense can crawl out of the grave \xe2\x80\x93 which may be the most difficult hope of them all. Yes, there is a lot of hoping going on these days.Other good news is that the Yankees and Michael Pineda got trashed by the Twins, 10-1.\xc2\xa0 For there to be any hopes for this 2015 season, the Orioles are going to need this story to repeat often. And again, they have to score more than a mere eight runs in four game stretches.Next: Orioles need a winning streak to startMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore44m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles vs. Tampa Bay Rays: Live Stream, Start ...', 'On Saturday, the Baltimore Orioles and\xc2\xa0Tampa Bay Rays will continue their three-game series at Tropicana Field.The Orioles struck first on Friday night, thanks to an RBI double from Chris Davis, but the Rays put up three runs in the bottom of the eighth to gain a 3-1 victory.Miguel Gonzalez (8-6, 4.21 ERA) will pitch the second game of this series for Baltimore, against Erasmo Ramirez (8-3, 3.54 ERA) of the Rays.Here are the starting lineups:Live Feed Baltimore OriolesCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles1.

(AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Erasmo Ramirez of the Tampa Bay Rays had his first bad inning in almost two months, and Chris Davis made him pay.Davis hit his fifth career grand slam and Miguel Gonzalez took a shutout into the eighth inning as the Baltimore Orioles snapped a four-game losing streak with a 5-1 victory over the Rays on Saturday night.Davis\' 22nd homer of the season broke a 0-0 tie in the third inning after J.J. Hardy, Jonathan Schoop and David Lough singled to load the bases against Ramirez, who had given up a total of four runs in his previous six starts.""I didn\'t execute a couple pitches in that inning, and that got me in trouble,"" Ramirez said. ""After that hit I put it out of my mind, just tried to get deep into the game. That was my plan after that, but it was tough. It was 4-0.""Ramirez (8-4) became the first Rays starter to pitch into the eighth inning since Chris Archer on June 23, giving up five earned runs and seven hits in 7 1-3 innings. The right-hander didn\'t issue a walk and struck out five. He entered Saturday night with a streak of nine consecutive appearances allowing two or fewer runs, tied for the second-longest stretch in Rays\' history.But the bad pitch to Davis came at a bad time.""Obviously with the full count and the bases loaded, I know he\'s not going to walk me, or he\'s not trying to walk me. So I looked for a pitch out over the plate and was able to get a good swing on it,"" Davis said.""He\'s got pop so he can hit the ball out of the park anywhere,"" Ramirez said. ""I tried to expand the inside corner but I didn\'t get it there and he just took advantage of that.""Gonzalez (9-6) allowed one run and five hits over 7 2-3 innings to win for the third time in his last four starts.""This wasn\'t the first time he\'s pitched a good ball game against us. We\'ve had some issues with him,"" Rays manager Kevin Cash said. ""We\'re in a rut. We\'ve been in it for some time.""The Orioles added a run in the eighth when Lough tripled and bounced up from his slide to jog home and score on second baseman Logan Forsythe\'s throwing error.The five runs are the most Ramirez has allowed in two months, a span of 10 starts in which he\'s gone 6-2 with two no-decisions.Gonzalez, meanwhile, improved to 2-1 in four starts against Tampa Bay this season, limiting the light-hitting Rays to three runs in 29 innings. He allowed doubles to Evan Longoria and singles to Kevin Kiermaier and James Loney through six innings.The Rays, who lost for the 20th time in 29 games, avoided being shut out for a 10th time when Curt Casali homered off Gonzalez with one out in the eighth.Chaz Roe finished the combined five-hitter for the Orioles, retiring all four batters he faced after replacing Gonzalez.TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: RHP Jason Garcia (right shoulder) has allowed three runs, six hits and eight walks and struck out nine over nine innings in his first five minor league rehab games with Double-A Bowie.Rays: LHP Drew Smyly (torn labrum) will start a minor league rehab assignment Sunday with Triple-A Durham.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsLike many things in life, baseball momentum can snowball; and it can happen in two directions. Over the past 20 games for the Orioles, the snowball effect has been a total avalanche as they lost 75% of those games. But the momentum shifted on Saturday evening, as amazingly a collection of things went right for a change.Even though the Orioles only tallied a total of seven base hits, they were able to bunch five of them in the same inning, scoring four runs on a Chris Davis grand slam. Most of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 recent home runs have been of the solo variety. Davis stepped up at a critical time.Also stepping up was starter Miguel Gonzalez. He gave the Orioles their second consecutive quality start, giving up only an eighth-inning solo shot while yielding five hits in 7.1 innings. If he can get this sort of consistent performance back together, along with Chris Tillman hitting stride, the Orioles will have something. Chen pitches today (Sunday) and has been consistently good. So it comes down to Jimenez and Gausman getting straightened out in order for the rotation to dominate as it did in the latter portion of last season.For the second consecutive day, Manny Machado batted in the number three position in the order. He has been good at leadoff \xe2\x80\xa6 better than most people would give him credit for, in that he is not the prototypical speedster. But he simply has to hit lower in the lineup due to his power production. Truly he is the best hitter now on the Orioles, and third is typically where the top batter is placed. Adam Jones fits well at cleanup, or Chris Davis to break up the two right-handers.

He loaded the bases with a single ahead of Davis, and he also used his speed to add the fifth run on a triple and defensive error.It was odd to see the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup before the game have Chris Davis in the number two spot. In support of that, even though he strikes out at a high rate, he also does draw a lot of walks. And even when his average is not the best, his on base percentage is really never terribly low.But having Davis in the two hole where he hit the game-changing grand slam really makes Showalter look like a genius and prophet once again.The home run was the 178th of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 career, but only the third time out of the second position in the batting order. The first time was August 11th of last year off the Yankee\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Capuano \xe2\x80\x93 a two-run shot that put the O\xe2\x80\x99s ahead in the fifth inning 4-3 on the way to an 11-3 victory. This was the game where Machado was injured for the season, and Davis replaced him at third base while batting second in the lineup. The other occasion was just two weeks ago in Minnesota off Casey Fien, a solo shot that followed the same by Machado.So, it is a win. Take it. Even though the Yankees and Jays also won. Maybe this begins a journey over the next 66 games of the season that can bring the Orioles back into contention.Next: A rare bad day by O'DayMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore44m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles top Rays 5-2 for second straight win', 'Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Wei-Yin Chen, left, of Taiwan,  walks back to the mound as Tampa Bay Rays\' Logan Forsythe runs around the bases after hitting a home run during the fourth inning of a baseball game Sunday, July 26, 2015, in St. Petersburg, Fla.

And if not that, it is the beginning of the big turnaround wherein the Orioles will be winning well over 60% of their remaining 65 games. That is what it is going to take to return to the top of the A.L. East.Finally the post-break road trip is over!

He has now hit safely in nine consecutive games, going 11-for-38 with three home runs and eight RBIs.\xc2\xa0 Davis currently has a seasonal batting average of .242.In each of the months of June and July, Davis has hit for a .257 average \xe2\x80\x93 totaling 10 home runs and 30 RBIs.\xc2\xa0 These are not massive numbers, but if he can continue this pace for the remainder of the season, Davis can bat close to .250, while hitting 38 home runs and driving in 101 runs.\xc2\xa0 We would have signed up for those totals from him at the beginning of the year.Going the opposite direction with numbers is Nick Markakis, who will be making his first return to Oriole Park with the Braves on Monday night.

After batting .338 in April, he is hitting just .230 in July.\xc2\xa0 Markakis has done better on the road for the Braves than he has in Atlanta. He is .318 outside of Georgia, but only .251 at home.

He was offered a great deal in Atlanta, and one that the Orioles would have been foolish to match at that. In fact, his contract was voted the worst (meaning the least team-friendly) of the off season by MLB GM\xe2\x80\x99s. That\xe2\x80\x99s just another way of saying that Atlanta got ripped off. So in essence, I\xe2\x80\x99m also saying that fans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t blame the Orioles for not bringing Markakis back.Markakis also made some unfortunate comments in the wake of signing with Atlanta, which perhaps justly angered many Orioles fans. However I would submit that Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 body of work with this franchise is too strong and thus too important to simply discard it due to him expressing his opinion about why the O\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring him back.Courtesy of H. Darr Beiser-USA TODAY SportsIf you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a \xe2\x80\x9ctrue Oriole,\xe2\x80\x9d look no further than Markakis. His conduct on and off the field embodied everything that Orioles fans look for in their players. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to many people who have told me they thought he was \xe2\x80\x9cstandoffish,\xe2\x80\x9d or in some cases even rude. But nothing could be further from the truth. He\xe2\x80\x99s simply what we, who\xe2\x80\x99s every step and move isn\xe2\x80\x99t put under the microscope of celebrity, like to call\xc2\xa0shy. And I say that with compassion, because I myself and the same way.Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 wife and kids still live in the Baltimore area, so this will also be a few days where he can visit with them and sleep for a few nights in his own bed. So I suspect that it was a very joyous evening in the Markakis household last night when Atlanta arrived here on their team charter from St. Louis. Not only did Nick get to see his wife and kids, but he got to drive presumably in his own car to his own home.These kinds of stories aren\xe2\x80\x99t uncommon in sports today, as numerous athletes return to their old homes to play their old teams. Most famously in recent history we can look to the NFL and see Brett Favre playing at Lambeau Field as a Minnesota Viking.

He was offered a great deal in Atlanta, and one that the Orioles would have been foolish to match at that. In fact, his contract was voted the worst (meaning the least team-friendly) of the off season by MLB GM\xe2\x80\x99s. That\xe2\x80\x99s just another way of saying that Atlanta got ripped off. So in essence, I\xe2\x80\x99m also saying that fans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t blame the Orioles for not bringing Markakis back.Markakis also made some unfortunate comments in the wake of signing with Atlanta, which perhaps justly angered many Orioles fans. However I would submit that Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 body of work with this franchise is too strong and thus too important to simply discard it due to him expressing his opinion about why the O\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring him back.Courtesy of H. Darr Beiser-USA TODAY SportsIf you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a \xe2\x80\x9ctrue Oriole,\xe2\x80\x9d look no further than Markakis. His conduct on and off the field embodied everything that Orioles fans look for in their players. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to many people who have told me they thought he was \xe2\x80\x9cstandoffish,\xe2\x80\x9d or in some cases even rude. But nothing could be further from the truth. He\xe2\x80\x99s simply what we, who\xe2\x80\x99s every step and move isn\xe2\x80\x99t put under the microscope of celebrity, like to call\xc2\xa0shy. And I say that with compassion, because I myself and the same way.Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 wife and kids still live in the Baltimore area, so this will also be a few days where he can visit with them and sleep for a few nights in his own bed. So I suspect that it was a very joyous evening in the Markakis household last night when Atlanta arrived here on their team charter from St. Louis. Not only did Nick get to see his wife and kids, but he got to drive presumably in his own car to his own home.These kinds of stories aren\xe2\x80\x99t uncommon in sports today, as numerous athletes return to their old homes to play their old teams. Most famously in recent history we can look to the NFL and see Brett Favre playing at Lambeau Field as a Minnesota Viking. I suspect that it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a surreal experience for Markakis, especially tonight in the first game of the series.

07/28/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: How does the Troy Tulowitzki trade ...', 'Troy Tulowitzki was the first major trade chip to be made this week \xe2\x80\x93 and he went to Toronto, a team within the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 division. So of course the question being asked today in Birdland is how is this impacting the O\xe2\x80\x99s? And quite frankly, the answer is that we just don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet. That might sound a bit simplistic, but work with me.Toronto sent Jose Reyes to Colorado (along with some prospects, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get into that later). So the teams effectively switched shortstops. Obviously if you disregard the prospects, Toronto got the better end of the deal. If you throw the prospects back in there, it was probably an even trade. But is Tulowitzki the end of Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s endeavors on the trade block?\xc2\xa0Live Feed troy tulowitskiPhoto: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsIf the answer to that question is yes, then I would submit that it might not impact the Orioles too much. And yes I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of the caliber of player that Tulowitzki is. However the Baseball Tonight crew made a great point about this on ESPN last night. Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Rogers Centre does funny things to players \xe2\x80\x93 especially infielders. So while Tulowitzki might well look good hitting there, will their infield defense be as strong? The fact is that we just don\xe2\x80\x99t know, along with the fact that Tulowitski does have a history of injury problems.But that goes back to whether or not Toronto is done with trades. Again as was pointed out on Baseball Tonight, Toronto has always been able to hit. It\xe2\x80\x99s been their pitching that\xe2\x80\x99s been suspect both this year as well as in the past. So could they not take some of the power that they already have and flip it for pitching?If they were to do that, they\xe2\x80\x99d probably become an odds on favorite to win the AL East \xe2\x80\x93 for the time being at least. Now that type of thing is a risky move for sure; look at Oakland last year. They had been in cruise control in their division for the entire way, only to trade Yoenis Cespedes to Boston for John Lester. And they limped into the playoffs as the second wild card \xe2\x80\x93 barely.\xc2\xa0More from Rumors1/18 - Baltimore Orioles: Should the Orioles Resign Mark Trumbo?

Will the prospects they sent out to Colorado pan out as eventual big league players? And will this trading of prospects eventually put Toronto into a roster crunch similar to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Orioles this year? Anything is possible, and the fact is that\xe2\x80\x99s the risk you run.One way or another, this should signal to the Orioles that if they\xe2\x80\x99re really going to go for it, they\xe2\x80\x99ll need to do something. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve hashed out here previously, there\xe2\x80\x99s a group of folks who wants the Orioles to sell. Regardless of whether it\xe2\x80\x99s buying or selling (I maintain they should be buyers), they need to do something. Standing pat at the trade deadline won\xe2\x80\x99t cut it. But in saying that, keep in mind that Dan Duquette is also normally active in August with waiver trades.

The Orioles won 2-1. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsMatt Wieters\xc2\xa0saved the Baltimore Orioles on Monday night by delivering two critical hits: a single that moved the game-tying run to third in the bottom of the ninth, and a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th inning. He may have saved more than just a game. We may remember this critical win for a long time.Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 clutch hit in the ninth came off former Orioles closer Jim Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 his fourth blown save of the season. Finally a Johnson blown save helps the O\xe2\x80\x99s! \xc2\xa0But honestly, he has had at least a decent season for the Braves. He came into the game with a 2.11 ERA and record of 2-3 in 48 appearances, along with nine saves.The hard-hit single by Wieters moved Adam Jones to third where he scored on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly \xe2\x80\x93 another clutch moment for Hardy, whose average is not the best, but who seems to make the most of tight situations.The walk-off homer by Wieters in the 11th was hit off the Braves\xe2\x80\x99 lefty Luis Avilan. It was the fourth walk-off bomb in Matt\xe2\x80\x99s career, this one stroked well out in deep right-center field. Nolan Reimold came just a few feet short of doing the same thing in the previous inning (Reimold had a single, double and walk in five plate appearances in the leadoff position \xe2\x80\x93 hopefully beginning a trend.).

This was his 36th such homer, hitting one in every 22 at-bats from that side. Though he has 60 career homers when batting left-handed, they only occur once in every 34 at-bats. His career average is also 27 points better versus lefties, though over the portions in has played in the past two years (as well as his first two years in MLB) just the opposite was true.The numbers for Matt Wieters in this regard are very, very odd. Take a look at the chart below. For the middle three years of his seven-year career thus far, he was far better as a right-handed hitter. O\xe2\x80\x99s fans may well recall that just a couple years ago there was a frequent outcry from fans that he should stop switch hitting.YearAB/AVG vs. RHPAB/AVG vs. LHP201589 / .25629 / .172201490 / .32521 / .2382013401 / .214178 / .2822012442 / .224151 / .3232011409 / .237142 / .3392010375 / .265127 / .2102009235 / .313150 / .248Career2041 / .248799 / .275\xc2\xa0This mixed bag of numbers is enough to drive a hitting coach crazy. One would hope that the day would come when he hits equally well from both sides of the plate.Perhaps bigger than the Wieters hits was the great outing by Kevin Gausman, going 7.2 innings of outstanding, scoreless pitching. All his pitches were working, and hopefully this too sets him up for the remainder of the season. It is unfortunate that the \xe2\x80\x9coptions problems\xe2\x80\x9d of so much of the roster has worked against Gausman being able to really settle in as a big league starter.Other than the homer given up, oddly, by Zach Britton, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching was excellent. This was especially true in scoring position situations, as the Braves were 0-for-9 with RISP (and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were 0-for-4).The welcome home for Nick Markakis was appropriately warm.

Once again, Ubaldo started off looking like 2014 Ubaldo, and not pre-All-Star break Ubaldo. Orioles fans were full of angst.And then, Jimenez went on to load the bases after hitting Jace Peterson, and it looked like it was going to get worse.

Because all three have been awful in the month of July.At this point, I want David Lough and Nolan Reimold starting every day, and Snider and Parmelee either on the bench, or, preferably released.But then Ryan Flaherty, who also is struggling, grounded out.But, Chris Davis would hit another home run in the second inning, and the Orioles would cruise from there.Just as impressive as Davis\xe2\x80\x99 home runs was Ubaldo Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s response to the first inning.After the first, Ubaldo allowed exactly zero hits the next six innings. Not bad for a guy who looked destined for a third straight short outing.All this leads me to a call for sanity among Oriole fans. O\xe2\x80\x99s fans are frustrated at the lack of movements, calling out Buck Showalter for who is in the starting line up, and jumping on a pitcher as soon as he leaves up a run.I know baseball is an emotional game, but the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 brass is trying to get them into the playoffs. You can take that to the bank.\xc2\xa0 These are sound baseball men who know what they are doing.And although it looks like the New York Yankees, who are currently playing very well, have a strong grip on the division, there is still a lot to play for for the Baltimore Orioles.On a four-game win streak currently, the O\xe2\x80\x99s seem to be coming together and heating up at the right time.

He mowed down Atlanta hitters let and right, and the sad thing is that in the long run he had nothing to show for it in terms of being in line to pick up the win.This game of course featured the return of Nick Markakis to Baltimore as a visiting player, and that was agnowledged by both the fans and Markakis. As he strode to the plate to lead off the game, the Camden faithful rose to it\xe2\x80\x99s feet in a standing ovation. Markakis, ever the humble gentleman, eventually stepped out of the batters box and doffed his cap to the fans. Each time Markakis would come to bat during the game, he\xe2\x80\x99d get a nice hand \xe2\x80\x93 a trend I expect to continue all week. And it\xe2\x80\x99s well deserved.The Orioles took a scoreless tie into the ninth inning with Atlanta last night, and Zach Britton was summoned from the \xe2\x80\x98pen in the top of the ninth. After recording one out, Adonis Garcia came to the plate and promptly gave Atlanta a 1-0 lead with a solo homer. When there\xe2\x80\x99s no score, all it takes is one mistake by a reliever and suddenly someone\xe2\x80\x99s in line to win. Britton\xe2\x80\x99s sinker didn\xe2\x80\x99t sink properly on one pitch, and we saw the result.However in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 home yard they bat last \xe2\x80\x93 home team bats last, remember?! Adam Jones got on base in the last of the ninth with an\xc2\xa0excuse me swinging bunt. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he meant to hit the ball up the third base line, and Atlanta certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting it. However he placed it just perfectly enough to where Atlanta closer (and former Oriole) Jim Johnson couldn\xe2\x80\x99t throw him out at first base. The Orioles ended up with runners at the corners following a Wieters single, and they tied the game on a J.J. Hardy sac fly-RBI.Again folks, home team bats last! Unfortunately for fans, media, and players, the game didn\xe2\x80\x99t ust end in the tenth inning. However we did see Atlanta manager Freddie Garcia do somethin curious, a stunt which he also pulled in the eighth inning: he IBB\xe2\x80\x99d Chris Davis with a runner on second. When he did it in the eighth I felt is was warranted given that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t totally mean the game at that point. However I thought it was curious in the tenth given that Machado hits-for-average much better than Davis. All the Orioles needed at that point was a base hit as opposed to a home run \xe2\x80\x93 but both times it worked in Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s favor.Whenever a game goes to extras people start wondering when it\xe2\x80\x99s eventually going to end. Are we in for a marathon game of some sort? Is someone eventually going to score? The good news for the Orioles is that once again they get their last at-bat at home.

Wieters knew it, the fans knew it, Nick Markakis knew it, and the Orioles knew it.

Teams are offered trades everyday \xe2\x80\x93 and they turn them down. This leads me to believe that plenty of teams are interested in trading with the Orioles. However I would submit that they\xe2\x80\x99re asking for too much.This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean that they\xe2\x80\x99re asking for guys like Manny Machado in exchange for a rental. I believe that Machado is already established enough to where he\xe2\x80\x99s probaby out of trade talks at this point (not to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible). However don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if the likes of Schoop, Gausman, and perhaps even Bundy.The point here is that before they\xe2\x80\x99re accused of not being willing to spend or buy what\xe2\x80\x99s necesary to win, it\xe2\x80\x99s not through a lack of trying. Do fans really want the O\xe2\x80\x99s to make a trade that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have a negative ripple effect years in the future? At this point, I would say no.

I also think that Washington overpaid for Papelbon last night. Most fans will argue that if said team wins a World Series, it was then obviously worth it.But that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. Look at Philadelphia and Boston; they\xe2\x80\x99re both in the cellar due in part to the fact that they bought somewhat recklessly over the years.

They are sitting back and waiting it out.The Orioles have been involved in their fair share of the rumors just like any other team in the MLB right now. Certain guys are comfortable knowing that they are staying put, but many others have no idea what their future holds. Who will still be in Baltimore by Friday?Adam Jones and Manny Machado are virtually untouchable. Sure, you listen to every offer that is out there, but there is no chance that they are going anywhere. Those two players are the cornerstones of this ball club. The rest of the group you would think is for sale, but that is not necessarily the case.Roch Kubatko of MASNsports.com reported that teams keep asking about Machado, Jonathan Schoop, Kevin Gausman and Mychal Givens. The Orioles have refused to include any of those names in deals as they view them as valuable pieces moving forward. It makes you wonder just who the Orioles are willing to depart with.The majority of the rumors that the Orioles have been associated with have involved corner outfielders. That is a logical need if you have been watching the Orioles this season. Buck Showalter has consistently changed his corner outfielders in the search of finding someone to take over the role. The Orioles have had Alejandro De Aza, Nolan Reimold, Steve Pearce, Delmon Young, Travis Snider, Chris Parmelee, David Lough and Chris Davis all play in the outfield this season. They need someone to take over one of those spots and leave Buck with one decision to make in the outfield rather than two.Dan Duquette would like to solidify one of those outfield spots via a trade. Baltimore is looking for an outfielder with some pop, similar to a guy that currently plays in Seattle, and there are some interesting names that have been floating around for the Orioles. Baltimore has been linked to Justin Upton, Yoenis Cespedes and Carlos Gonzalez. The Orioles have also been linked to a big-time deal that would include Upton and could include a San Diego pitcher such as Andrew Cashner or Tyson Ross. They were also supposedly in for the running for Brandon Moss, who was traded from the Cleveland Indians to the St. Louis Cardinals today.\xc2\xa0oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dCurt Schilling Continues to be an EmbarrassmentMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday1 d - Fantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL1 d - Boston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue3d - Baltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red SoxMore News at Birds Watcher  The problem with most of the guys the Orioles have been associated with is they each are in the final years of their deals and will likely walk after this offseason. Duquette needs to balance going for it all this season, while not damaging the future of the organization. He does not want to give up a handful of prospects and getting nothing in returnThere is a lot of pressure to make a move as the Orioles sit just one game back of the wild card spot. Baltimore is blessed with some terrific arms in their farm system, but they view some of those talents as the next rotation pieces. The Orioles are lacking the mid-level prospects to make a move, and have been unwilling to deal their top prospects such as Gausman, Dylan Bundy, Hunter Harvey. Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson have proven that they can perform in the Majors this season so it is interesting to see if teams are calling about the two pitchers.The current five-game winning streak has changed the tone in Baltimore a bit. It seemed like a week ago that selling off soon-to-be free agents such as Chris Davis, Matt Wieters, Wei-Yin Chen and Bud Norris to name a few. There is a likelihood that none of these players are back next season and will walk for free. Now that they are in position to make a playoff push, they are likely to be buying rather than selling.The Orioles have made their fair share of moves in recent years to potentially win a championship. Last season they landed Andrew Miller and De Aza. Norris and Francisco Rodriguez were also brought in near the trade deadline in recent seasons.The AL East has changed a lot over the past few days. The Blue Jays got significantly better and the Yankees are going to be difficult to catch with their current six-game lead. The Orioles need to make a move to keep pace. Duquette has shown that he is not afraid to make a move, so it is only a matter of time before something gets done.We will see what Orioles trade comes together by 4:00 p.m. tomorrow when the deadline comes and goes.Next: Updated Baltimore Orioles Rumor MillMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore44m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago "", 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

Murray, USA TODAY Sports)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE - The Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 busy July 31 started when the club traded for outfielder Gerardo Parra from the Milwaukee Brewers. With a few hours still left until the 4 p.m. deadline, they already had an upgrade that would help them stay in the hunt in the American League East.\r And it came at a small cost \xe2\x80\x94 small enough that the atmosphere in the clubhouse was loose as it would be on a normal day. Relief pitcher Tommy Hunter even joked about being traded himself.\r The next move, however, didn\xe2\x80\x99t provoke nearly the same mood. A few minutes later, the Orioles traded Hunter, a 29-year-old in his fourth full season with the team, to the Chicago Cubs for outfielder Junior Lake.\r The management informed Hunter, and Hunter said his final goodbyes to teammates on the way out. Then manager Buck Showalter walked into his pregame press conference and asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x99s everybody so solemn?\xe2\x80\x9dThe net impact of Friday on the big-league club, of course, is positive. Entering Friday, Baltimore was hitting .210 and slugging just .330 in the left-field slot, occupied most often by David Lough, Travis Snider and Nolan Reimold. Parra brings a .328 average and .517 slugging percentage and has won two Gold Glove awards. He fills a void in the lineup, perhaps in the leadoff slot, allowing third baseman Manny Machado to move down.\r In return, the Orioles gave up Class AAA right-hander Zach Davies. In 19 appearances (18 starts) this season, Davies posted a 2.84 earned-run average.\r \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one of those that should work out really well for both clubs,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cGot a good player back and gave up a good pitching prospect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r But as with most teams, the day didn\xe2\x80\x99t go calmly.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } MLB trade deadline tracker: Players on the move\r Early in the afternoon, Baltimore designated right-hander Bud Norris for assignment. Norris was a critical piece of the 2014 Orioles that won the AL East and swept Detroit in the AL Divisional Series, winning 15 games and shutting out the Tigers over 6.1 innings in the clinching game of the series.\r But he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t recapture that success this year in the rotation or the bullpen. In 11 starts and seven relief outings, his ERA is 7.06.\r \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder of about how things snowball mentally and emotionally,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s physically fine. Someone\xe2\x80\x99s going to pick him up, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to pitch well for them.\r \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got some really good pitching ahead of him. It just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r Later in the day, just before the deadline, came the more shocking move. Hunter moved to the bullpen full-time in 2013, and since then he has a 3.05 ERA in 191 2/3 innings for the team.\r As with Norris, losing him and adding a different arm to the bullpen gives the Orioles the flexibility to option a reliever, and the club adds another outfield bat in Junior Lake. Still, after the day had gone smoothly until then, Showalter called losing Hunter \xe2\x80\x9ctough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r \xe2\x80\x9cTommy never has a bad day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cVery infectious possibility, and he can pitch.\xe2\x80\x9d     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Blue Jays keep dealing, acquire Ben Revere and Mark LoweHe added that Hunter remained upbeat after the trade, that he was the one cheering up the team\xe2\x80\x99s management.\r \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to stomp out of here like I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d Hunter told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I loved it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r But Showalter said the Orioles ended Friday as a better baseball team than they started it. They had to, with the New York Yankees leading them in the AL East by six games and the Toronto Blue Jays going all-in and acquiring shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, ace David Price, reliever Mark Lowe and outfielder Ben Revere. The Orioles became more capable of keeping pace.\r On July 31, sometimes instability comes as a side-effect.\r \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re trying to win a world championship this year,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what it\xe2\x80\x99s all about.

08/01/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Additions and Subtractions Improve Team', 'Jul 31, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles newly acquired outfielder Gerardo Parra (18) sits on the bench during the third inning against the Detroit Tigers at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsIt was a busy day for Baltimore Orioles Vice President of Baseball Operations Dan Duquette. Though some may criticize him for not getting a deal done with the Phillies to bring Ben Revere to the O\xe2\x80\x99s (instead of seeing him go to the Jays), it is difficult to not see that the team is better today than it was yesterday.Addition \xe2\x80\x93 Gerardo Parra \xe2\x80\x93 Traded midday for minor league pitcher Zach Davies, we wrote more extensively about this earlier. There is no doubt that he has been and most certainly will be better than anyone the Orioles have run out to left field this year. He has the best batting average in all of baseball since the beginning of May.MASN\xe2\x80\x99s broadcast caught some great pictures of him arriving in the dugout in the second inning and systematically greeting player after player. It was a good look. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet Buck even says \xe2\x80\x9cI like the look in his eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He has the immediate appearance of a good team guy.Again, alone he will not make the WHOLE difference, but this is an upgrade for sure. He is a rental, but as Duquette said when interviewed on the broadcast last night, \xe2\x80\x9cWho knows, maybe we can keep him in the future too.\xe2\x80\x9dAddition \xe2\x80\x93 Junior Lake \xe2\x80\x93 Received from the Cubs in a trade for Tommy Hunter. He will go to Norfolk. You gotta like the name, if nothing else!Lake, an outfielder, is only age 25. In 64 games in 2013 for the Cubs, he looked like the real deal by hitting .284 with an OBP of .332.\xc2\xa0 He has not been able to replicate that since then. Lake is a .299 career hitter in AAA.Several have compared him to a current Orioles player, as Duquette said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a player very similar to Jimmy Paredes \xe2\x80\xa6 but hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to establish himself.\xe2\x80\x9dHe does not look like an All-Star in the making \xe2\x80\x93 having only moderate power \xe2\x80\x93 but it was something in return for Hunter who will be a free agent after the season.Addition \xe2\x80\x93 Mychal Givens \xe2\x80\x93 Called up from AA to fill the spot vacated by Hunter.Reports are that everyone was asking about getting Givens in a trade. He has been a strikeout machine at Bowie. The converted, side-arming former infielder picked up the win last night in his second MLB game. He did not look overpowered at all!Addition \xe2\x80\x93 Mike Wright \xe2\x80\x93 Called up from AAA as a presumptive long reliever upon the DFA of Bud Norris.Wright made some earlier starts for the Orioles this season and looks at this point to be the frontrunner for a fifth slot next year in the rotation.

What else does he need to prove there?His availability was also asked about over and over by negotiating GMs. Along with Givens, these are players who can help the team now, give the roster some \xe2\x80\x9coptions,\xe2\x80\x9d and give the O\xe2\x80\x99s a look at guys who could be major pieces in the coming years.Subtraction \xe2\x80\x93 Tommy Hunter \xe2\x80\x93 Probably the best one-liner guy in the clubhouse, he was already missed in the bullpen last night when Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day totally muffed catching Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 three-run homer.Hunter has been a nice piece for the Orioles since coming to them in the Chris Davis / Koji Uehara deal with Texas. He\xe2\x80\x99s no closer \xe2\x80\x93 we know that. But he was, for the most part, an effective big-league reliever. But Tommy could give up some home runs and is not quite an elite bullpen arm, even with his high-90s velocity.Again, this was a chance to get something for him in light of his free agency, and along the way it was a bit of a salary dump to help pay for the Parra acquisition and the dollars on the books for such as Norris.I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure Hunter is the best for Wrigley Field, but Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop have given the Cubs confidence in trading with the Orioles.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore44m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d agoSubtraction \xe2\x80\x93 Bud Norris \xe2\x80\x93 This is simply sad, sad, sad; but it had to happen.\xc2\xa0 After a great 2014, it never worked out this year. But what a great year and what a really good guy is Norris. Just love the competitor. Full honesty, his talent is marginal, and for success he has to be finely-tuned and approaching a flawless pitch-to-pitch performance. Miguel Gonzalez is similar. The only really stellar season that Norris had was last year. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve written in the past, I had the same illness as a college pitcher and was worthless until the next year \xe2\x80\x93 it looked and felt good enough soon after recovering, but the results were like what Norris has seen happen. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll pick up with someone in the future and contribute again.Subtraction \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Parmalee \xe2\x80\x93 Designated for AssignmentIt just didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out. He had the good AAA season and a quick start with the O\xe2\x80\x99s. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame Duquette for taking a flier on this guy. Perhaps this is another example of someone who cannot be successful in a platooning situation. Or perhaps he is just a 4A player. It is too bad it did not work out. With the loss of Davis pending after this season, Parmelee was certainly a very slick fielder at first base.Subtraction \xe2\x80\x93 Zach Davies \xe2\x80\x93 Traded to the Brewers for Gerardo ParraAgain, check back to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s analysis for details. He certainly looks to be on the cusp of becoming a big league starter. Davies is a smart pitcher. We will remember him as originally one of our own as we watch what becomes of him with the Brewers.Parra did not get into the Friday night game to show us what that will look like at the top of the order, but it should be good along with Manny Machado.Of course, none of these improvements will make any real difference if Orioles starters continue to only get 10 outs before getting knocked out of the game, as has happened the past two evenings.Next: Thinking about the Parra / Davies trade ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Tommy Hunter was part of something \\u2026', ""First and foremost, I hope that Baltimore Orioles fans will join me in wishing Tommy Hunter well in Chicago. And on a similar note he\xe2\x80\x99s very lucky in that he\xe2\x80\x99s going from one special ballpark and tradition to another. Hunter called\xc2\xa0The Ballpark That Forever Changed Baseball home for the past three years or so, and now he\xe2\x80\x99ll head to\xc2\xa0The Friendly Confines.The trade deadline is always somewhat nerve-wracking for players who might potentially be on the move. In Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s case, his trade literally came right up against the deadline. And he also literally found out that he was traded by reporters huddled around his locker \xe2\x80\x93 the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 PR staff had been unable to get to him before the news broke on twitter and other social media. Some people will argue that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the job, and in this day and age they\xe2\x80\x99re probably right. But make no mistake about the fact that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly unfair; who among us would want to find something out about their job status from third-parties as such?\xc2\xa0Live Feed tommy hunterTampa Bay Rays: Finalizing Deal with Tommy Hunter Rays Colored GlassesPhillies Rumors: One-Year Options For Additional Relief Help That Balls Outta HereBaltimore Orioles Bring Tommy Hunter Back for Big Games The Baltimore WireCleveland Indians: Grading The Pitching Acquisitions Factory of SadnessCleveland Indians Roundup: Indians Activate Tommy Hunter, Series Preview Wahoo's on FirstYankees Had a Deal with Tommy Hunter That Fell Through Yanks Go YardHowever that aside, Hunter now has to move on and be as good of a reliever as he can be with the Chicago Cubs. However I do think that it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting something that WJZ-13\xe2\x80\x99s Mark Viviano addressed on this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWall to Wall Baseball\xe2\x80\x9d Show on MASN. Viviano mentioned that Tommy Hunter was a part of what became a very close-knit group of players that in effect oversaw the return to glory of a once great franchise. While many fans like to mock Hunter and claim that all he does is give up home runs, think about that for a moment.Photo: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsHunter was traded to the Orioles as part of the trade which brought Chris Davis here in 2011 (the O\xe2\x80\x99s sent Koji Uehara to Texas in exchange for those two). They joined the likes of Adam Jones, Nick Markakis, Matt Wieters, and others to form a team that would immediately become part of the post season discussion the following year \xe2\x80\x93 up to and including now. However even before that, many of these guys gelled together; how can one forget the close of the 2011 season that September?!To his credit, Hunter seemed like he genuinely was going to miss Baltimore and his Orioles teammates. Over that period of time, there\xe2\x80\x99s been no closer-knit team. Hunter addressed this, and his experiences in Baltimore almost immediately after getting the news of the trade (quote courtesy of Roch Kubatko of MASNsports):There were some great times. Just look at the last four years. Came over in \xe2\x80\x9911 and the crazy thing that happened in \xe2\x80\x9911 in September, just the way the team played. That was probably one of the coolest months I\xe2\x80\x99ve had in baseball, in 2011, when this team finished last and the walk-off and all that crazy stuff that happened at the end of the year. And \xe2\x80\x9912, shocking the world, I guess, and doing everything. And \xe2\x80\x9913, missing it a little bit. And \xe2\x80\x9914 having that Delmon Young hit, probably the loudest stadium I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been in. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fun times here and a lot of good people and a lot of friendships made. Hopefully, they continue through the years.Ultimately my point is the fact that my hope is that Orioles fans remember Hunter with fond memories. Pitchers are going to give up home runs \xe2\x80\x93 especially relievers. However Tommy Hunter is a name that should forever by synonymous with the Orioles returning to their rightful place in baseball. In no way am I suggesting that he was the sole reason for that or anything of the like. But he\xe2\x80\x99s a part of a group of guys that really did something special with this team and this city.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerTen or fifteen years from now, the core group of Orioles from 2012 until whenever will still be viewed as hero\xe2\x80\x99s to the people in the city. Even if the Birds go off and become a dynasty of sorts which lasts until that time, it will always have started with many of the names (and more) that I addressed above. (Heck, I would argue that it all began with a walk off RBI-double by Robert Andino.) And Tommy Hunter is very much a part of that group. Baltimore is a place where special people are always remembered well, even long after their time.And my hope is that Orioles fans remember that. If this franchise goes onward to win a World Series this year or in the future, odds are that Hunter won\xe2\x80\x99t be a part of it. (Keeping in mind of course that he could still return as a free agent after the season.) However he\xe2\x80\x99ll still hold a special place in the lore of this franchise, being such a part of the resurgence of the Orioles. And again, my hope is that Orioles fans keep that sentiment close to their hearts.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Trade Talks with Chicago for Tommy HunterMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\xc2\xa0Saturday night was another great team win for the Baltimore Orioles, but the game was about much more than Gerardo Parra\xe2\x80\x98s first game as an Oriole.The game started with Kevin Gausman sending the Tigers down 1-2-3, which is quite a feat considering that Jose Iglesias and Ian Kinsler are hitting close to .500 against the Orioles this year.That allowed the Orioles to come up to the plate and not be trailing for the first time this series. And they took advantage. Manny singled, Parra received a standing ovation and then lashed a double to right, and with no outs the O\xe2\x80\x99s were in business.

Hardy. Matt Wieters started at first base for the second time in his career, and he looked just fine defensively. Absolutely no issues there, including some nice stretches for throws at first.But, as I like to preach, it is all about the pitching, and particular for the Orioles, the starting pitching. The last two nights, Wei-Yin Chen and Miguel Gonzalez were\xe2\x80\xa6well pretty awful.Kevin Gausman, on Saturday, was not. He was dealing for the second straight game, the only blemish a two-run home run by Nick Castellanos. Gausman went seven strong innings and helped rest a fatigued bullpen.The only bad news on the day came on the injury front. Mike Wright is on the DL, and could be out a month with a leg strain.Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x98s ankle is improving, but he likely won\xe2\x80\x99t be making Monday\xe2\x80\x99s start. That means the O\xe2\x80\x99s have to call someone up, and about the only option is the best option, Tyler Wilson. I would expect to see him start Monday in Oakland.Sunday, Ubaldo Jimenez will take the mound and hope to carry over Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s momentum.Hopefully he can keep it going and help bring the O\xe2\x80\x99s a big series win.And, on Saturday, the Rays lost, the Jays lost, the Yankees lost, the Angels lost, and the Twins won. So the O\xe2\x80\x99s are two games out of the first wild card, one game out of the second wild card.Next: Evaluating the O's roster moves "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Top 7 Players in the Month of July', 'Next1 of 9Prev postUse your \xe2\x86\x90 \xe2\x86\x92 (arrows) to browseJul 31, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles relief pitcher Zach Britton (53) celebrates with catcher Matt Wieters (32) on the field after defeating the Detroit Tigers 8-7 at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

Here are a few pitchers in the organization making a name for themselves, and names that Orioles fans should start getting used to.RHP Oliver Drake, Norfolk Tides (triple-A)Oliver Drake has been having a very decent season in Norfolk, sporting a 0.58 ERA so far this season with the Tides. Drake was the Baltimores\xe2\x80\x99 43rd round pick in the 2008 draft, and has spent his entire career in the O\xe2\x80\x99s organization. The right handed closer has risen and fallen through the organization since 2008, even had a brief stint on the Orioles roster, which he pitched with a 3.52 ERA in 7.2 innings pitched.Currently this season, Drake has pitched in 31 innings, with 16 saves on the year. His ERA, which sits at 0.58, is very fascinating to see. If he continues to pitch as well as he has this season, we just might see the right hander pitching at Camden Yards very soon.\xc2\xa0More from Minors12/21 - Baltimore Orioles: Prospect Hunter Harvey to could resume throwing next week4/26 - Baltimore Orioles: Ryan Flaherty to Norfolk4/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Minor League Estate2/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Dylan Bundy has his Career in the Balance2/3 - Baltimore Orioles: First basemen on the move?RHP Terry Doyle, Bowie Baysox (double-A)Terry Doyle is currently in his first season in the O\xe2\x80\x99s Minor League system, and has started his Baltimore career with a bang. The right hander is 12-1 on the season, with a very impressive 1.97 ERA. Doyle was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 37th round of the 2008 draft. The 29 year old was acquired by the Orioles prior to the start of this season, and has been making his name for himself in the organization.With the way that Doyle is pitching, it will be highly likely that he will get called up at some point, whether its this season or in the up-coming offseason. With Norfolk sending both SP\xe2\x80\x99s Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson to the Orioles, look to see if the team sends up Doyle to Norfolk, who are looking for pitching help with those departures.LHP John Means, Delmarva Shorebirds (low single-A)John Means started off his 2015 campaign with the Shorebirds a little rocky, but has bounced back nicely. The left hander is currently 8-7 on the year, with a 3.48 ERA. I have had the honor of watching Means pitch live four times this season, and had the privilege of watching him throw a no-hitter on Friday night.Means through a seven inning no-hitter on Friday night, throwing 78 pitches, six strikeouts, and only allowing one walk.

08/03/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Strange fifth sinks Ubaldo Jimenez, Birds', ""For starters, Ubaldo Jimenez got roughed up in the first inning of yesterday afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s Baltimore Orioles series finale vs. Detroit. Roughed up might be a bit harsh, but he had some tough times for sure. But Jimenez rebounded to retire 12 straight Detroit hitters after that first inning. It appeared to be one of those games whereby Jimenez simply needed the bats to show up\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6but Oriole bats were stymied by Detroit rookie starter Daniel Norris. Let\xe2\x80\x99s put it this way; if Norris\xe2\x80\x99 performance was any indication, the real loser of the trade (which sent David Price to Toronto) was the Orioles. Norris could do no wrong against the Birds yesterday, although he did get a little help from his friends \xe2\x80\x93 an foes.Live Feed ubaldo jimenezBaltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Fun facts as the first trip to Yankee Stadium gets underway The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles Clicking on All Cylinders The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: What to Make of Recent Stellar Starts by Jimenez, Miley The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: What's next for Ubaldo Jim\xc3\xa9nez? The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Cincinnati Reds: 3 things to keep an eye on The Baltimore WireJimenez was hit hard from the beginning, although as I said he quieted downCourtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY Sportsright after the end of the first inning. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.2 IP, 6 H, 6 R, 1 BB, 2 K. Jimenez put two of the first three runners on base, and they moved into scoring position on Victor Martinez\xe2\x80\x98s sac fly. With J.D. Martinez coming to the plate and first base open, Jimenez was under no obligation to throw anything worth hitting. However he hung a fastball, and Martinez jumped on it \xe2\x80\x93 it landed in the bullpen.However as I said, Jimenez buckled down after that first inning. He retired the next twelve Detroit hitters, and in the process Chris Davis smacked a solo home run to right center to cut the lead to 3-1. At that point it looked like the O\xe2\x80\x99s might make a run at things. But the fifth inning put a stop to that \xe2\x80\x93 after Jimenez retired the first two hitters, that is.Why the Orioles struggle in the field or on the mound once they reach two strikes, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure. However strange things seem bound to happen. Rajai Davis hit what should have been a single over the outstretched glove of Chris Davis. The Orioles were playing the other way, so it took Nolan Reimold some time to get over to the ball. Davis immediately started to try to stretch it into a double \xe2\x80\x93 which based on where the ball was and so forth, was probably a stupid move.But as can often happen, Davis was rewarded in a sense for making a careless move. Reimold hit the cutoff man trying to relay the ball into second base \xe2\x80\x93 and I mean he literally \xe2\x80\x9chit\xe2\x80\x9d the cutoff man. His throw ended up nailing Jonathan Schoop in the shoulder, which eventually allowed Davis to get to third base. While Davis was running, Schoop doubled over in pain\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6he ended up being fine, however it was just a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time as a bad throw was made. And while that happens sometimes, the fact that a teammate could have been injured makes it a lot worse. Anthony Gose\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single would score Davis from third, and Gose would proceed to steal second \xe2\x80\x93 a play that the Orioles challenged. Replays were inconclusive, however Buck Showalter felt that the umpiring crew missed that one. After Gose proceeded to steal third, he would score on Jose Inglesias\xe2\x80\x99 RBI-triple. Inglesias would score on Ian Kinsler\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single.That gave Detroit a 6-1 lead, a mark that would hold up for the rest of the game. All things being equal, the O\xe2\x80\x99s would have lost this game 3-1 if not for that blip in the fifth inning. However bear in mind that happened with two outs. Rajai Davis hit a legitimate single, however he would have stayed there at first base if not for Reimold hitting Schoop and so forth \xe2\x80\x93 which means that the rest of that might not have happened also. This shows why you have to play such a close attention to detail, because small things can balloon if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t careful.The Orioles now head out to Oakland to begin a three-game set and a nine-game road trip. Chris Tillman was to get the start tonight, however an ankle injury is keeping him out until later in the week. The Orioles are saying that this will not be a DL situation as of what they know right now.Instead, Tyler Wilson will be called up from triple-A Norfolk to make the start. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s Jesse Chavez.

08/04/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Should Dan Duquette look for August \\u2026', ""I think that the consensus around Baltimore Orioles fans is that Dan Duquette did a decent job for the Birds at the non-waiver trade deadline last week. My personal opinion is that he addressed the club\xe2\x80\x99s most pressing need in obtaining a strong-hitting corner outfielder. However the trade season isn\xe2\x80\x99t over \xe2\x80\x93 not by a long shot.Growing up watching baseball in the summers, I nary recall too many trades occuring past July 31st. However in recent years I would submit that trades in August (through waivers) have become more and more popular. The Orioles have done it a few times over the past couple of seasons, as have numerous other clubs. Basically a team puts a player on waivers, which means he can be claimed by any other team (in the order of the standings). If he isn\xe2\x80\x99t claimed, he\xe2\x80\x99s then cleared waivers and can be traded.\xc2\xa0Live Feed dan duquetteBaltimore Orioles will take advantage of new 10-day disabled list The Baltimore WireBlue Jays' Bautista called out by Orioles GM Jays JournalDan Duquette continues his one-man crusade against Jose Bautista FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Prioritizing current success or long-term success? The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles could be interested in bringing back Matt Wieters The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles reportedly in contact with outfielder Jose Bautista The Baltimore WireThis is obviously much more risky given the fact that basically the entire league has a shot at the player(s) before the trade can happen. (Incidentally if another team claims the player the original team can pull him back. But if they do not, the claiming team gets the player \xe2\x80\x93 and responsibility for his entire contract.) Most non-contending teams won\xe2\x80\x99t block trades, but often times contending teams will make claims on guys just to block a player from going to a rival.Photo: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsI would submit that Dan Duquette needs to be active during August if the Orioles are going to have a good shot at returning to the post season. Our host network, Fansided, published this article\xc2\xa0last week explaining the process, and offering some players who might see themselves traded through waivers. You\xe2\x80\x99ll notice\xc2\xa0Justin Upton\xe2\x80\x98s name on that list; he\xe2\x80\x99s a guy in whom the Orioles were interested leading up to the non-waiver deadline. Might he still be available?I suspect that San Diego didn\xe2\x80\x99t move Upton because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get an offer that fit in with their view of Upton\xe2\x80\x99s true value. And quite frankly I can\xe2\x80\x99t blame them for that \xe2\x80\x93 as Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s often said, you never want to let other teams undervalue your players. However August is also a time when prices tend to head into the bargain basement on players. First and foremost, there is some risk involved in trading a guy through waivers. However secondly, players like Upton aren\xe2\x80\x99t worth as much as they were prior to last week\xe2\x80\xa6they won\xe2\x80\x99t be on the new team as long.\xc2\xa0More from Rumors1/18 - Baltimore Orioles: Should the Orioles Resign Mark Trumbo?

The reason I singled Upton out on that list is because he\xe2\x80\x99s an outfielder; and the O\xe2\x80\x99s could still use a bit more pop out there. Furthermore the platoon system seems to have moved over to first base, and if the Birds could aquire an additional outfielder of Upton\xe2\x80\x99s caliber, it would probably send Chris Davis\xc2\xa0back to first full time.For those who suggest that the O\xe2\x80\x99s can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to send away any more prospects, I certainly hear your voices. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a slight part of me that agrees with you. However when you have the opportunity to make it to the post season, you have to do what you can do complete the job. Furthermore as I said, August trades normally cost clubs much less in terms of prospects. And that does make a difference.For all intents and purposes, the trade season does end after August 31st. However there\xe2\x80\x99s even a proviso on that as well. Teams can still make trades through waivers in September, although it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen often. Any player that\xe2\x80\x99s traded in September is inelligible to play on a post season roster. So if you think you can find a guy that will help you physically make it to the post season, you can make a trade in September. But if you end up making it, he can\xe2\x80\x99t play once the regular season is over.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Tommy Hunter was part of something specialMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

In the first nine games of the year he hit six home runs and had 19 RBIs \xe2\x80\x93 16 in the first four games.June 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 Davis hit seven home runs in nine games, driving in 13 runs.July 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 There was a stretch of four games where Davis hit a home run in each, with eight runs knocked in.End of the 2012 season \xe2\x80\x93 Davis homered in six consecutive games \xe2\x80\x93 a total of seven long balls and 13 RBIs that carried the O\xe2\x80\x99s into the playoffs.In the five stretches mentioned in this article \xe2\x80\x93 four from the past and this current streak \xe2\x80\x93 the Orioles have a combined record of 26-15. Annualize that and it comes out to 102 seasonal wins.Davis has now hit 183 home runs in his career, 141 of them with the Orioles. If you add his 118 minor league home runs, he is now over 300 in his professional career.

It was known at that time that he had power, though nobody was thinking he would hit quite as many as have come off his bat since then.Davis has hit 123 home runs in victories for his team, with the other 60 in losses. Caleb Joseph, who hit his 18th career home run Monday night, has hit 14 of the 18 in games that the Orioles have won.While looking at Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 home run log, it is interesting to see that of his 183 career home runs, there is no pitcher off whom he has hit more than three round-trippers. Five pitchers have given up three home runs to Crush: Carlos Villanueva, Ervin Santana, Rick Porcello, Phil Coke, and Ivan Nova.Coco Crisp had two hits for the A\xe2\x80\x99s in his first game back since May. He has been a tough out for the Orioles over his 14-year career during which he has an overall average of .268.\xc2\xa0 Against the Orioles it is .288 with a .388 on base percentage.The Orioles looked really, really good in this game, totally dominant in every aspect.

Wilson was pitching with a heavy heart, and also with some extra motivation.His wife\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather, a big baseball fan, passed away, and the funeral was on Monday. But, Wilson felt like he would have wanted him to pitch in the major leagues, and that is what the young right-hander did on Monday evening in Oakland.Wilson went 7 2/3 innings, allowing two runs on six hits with three strikeouts. He received plenty of run support from Chris Davis and company en route to a 9-2 victory.Wrapping up the game for the O\xe2\x80\x99s was Mychal Givens, the converted short stop turned relief pitcher with a sidearm delivery.

Givens could be a set-up man, especially if Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day leaves in free agency. Wilson could have a spot in the rotation, as the Orioles will have to figure out if they bring back Wei-Yin Chen.There also was a glimpse of what might be missing in 2015. Chris Davis has been on fire the past few weeks, as documented here.Davis, along with Chen, O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Gerardo Parra and Matt Wieters, are all free agents at the end of the year. The Orioles are going to have to decide which ones they want to try to re-sign. Chris Davis should be at the top of that list, but the way he is playing, he may command more money than what the O\xe2\x80\x99s can give him.The Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 farm system is often viewed as subpar, but they had two players show on Monday night that they belong in the majors.

As we are seeing right now in Oakland, the A\xe2\x80\x99s are not much of an offense, but they can pitch. The Twins seem to be in a current slide that will hopefully continue for a couple of weeks; and the Mets have been hot of late, just as they were in early May when they beat the Birds 3-2 and 5-1.Relative to the A.L.

Yet, the Orioles entered the season with him on the 25-man roster.As you can expect, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t go well. Garcia struggled, including a pitch behind a Toronto Blue Jay which almost incited a brawl.But, then Garcia got hurt.

And he didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly pitch well while in Bowie, either.Yet, on Friday the O\xe2\x80\x99s called up Garcia and sent Mychal Givens back to AA Bowie.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Kevin Gausman could hardly be faulted for giving up a homer to birthday boy Mike Trout.Giving up a two-out, two-strike, two-run double to an Angels catcher batting well below .200 was much less forgivable for Gausman in a rough loss for the Baltimore Orioles.Trout homered on his birthday for the third time in his career, and Chris Iannetta delivered the go-ahead double in the sixth inning of the Los Angeles Angels\' 8-4 victory Friday night.Matt Wieters and Jonathan Schoop homered for the Orioles, who blew a 4-3 lead for their third loss in five games.Gausman (2-3) yielded nine hits and six runs despite dominating at times. He fell one strike short of escaping the sixth inning when Iannetta drilled his double off the wall to boost his average to .193.""It seemed like every time we took the lead, I went out there and didn\'t put up a scoreless inning,"" Gausman said. ""And when you struggle against the bottom half of the lineup like I did, eventually it\'s going to hurt you.""Pinch-hitter C.J. Cron hit a two-run homer in the seventh for the Angels, who trimmed Houston\'s lead in the AL West to 1 1-2 games with their third win in four games following a six-game skid.David Murphy, Johnny Giavotella and David DeJesus all drove in runs for the Angels. Iannetta connected on the 98th pitch by Gausman.""We didn\'t pitch very well out of the bullpen,"" Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. ""There\'s a game there to be won, and that\'s what\'s frustrating. They had some good at-bats and they found some holes. They\'re a good team that\'s having a good year, and we have to upgrade our level a little bit if we\'re going to stay with them.""Trout celebrated his 24th birthday by going 2 for 3 with two walks and scoring two runs, but he also added another unique moment to his superlative career. The reigning AL MVP hit his major league-leading 33rd homer to the fake rock pile beyond left-center.Trout also homered on his birthday in 2012 and 2013, becoming the first player in major league history to hit three birthday homers before even turning 25.""I think that gave me the chills,"" Trout said of the first-inning chorus from the stands. ""To have fans sing me \'Happy Birthday,\' it means a lot. It\'s huge.""Trout\'s 131st career homer was his first of August and his first in six games, ending a 1-for-20 slump for the four-time All-Star. Only Eddie Mathews, Mel Ott and Ken Griffey Jr. hit more homers before their 24th birthday in major league history.Rookie Andrew Heaney had his worst start for Los Angeles, yielding season-highs of 10 hits and four runs while getting chased in the sixth. The left-hander had won five of his first seven starts since joining the Angels\' rotation in late June, never allowing more than two runs.Schoop hit a two-run homer in the fourth, but Los Angeles evened it later in the inning with Murphy\'s first RBI for the Angels and Giavotella\'s tying double.Wieters connected in the sixth for his fifth homer, but Fernando Salas (2-1) stranded two Baltimore runners in scoring position by striking out Nolan Reimold.DeJesus added an RBI single after Iannetta\'s clutch drive, improving to 2 for 22 with his new team.NEW GUYJunior Lake went 1 for 4 with a sixth-inning double in his debut with the Orioles, who acquired the outfielder from the Cubs last month. Baltimore recalled him from Triple-A Norfolk before the game, designating Travis Snider for assignment.BIG BLASTCron\'s homer went an estimated 456 feet on reliever Brad Brach\'s first pitch. It was the Angels\' first pinch-hit homer of the season and their first since David Freese connected on July 5, 2014.TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: LHP Chris Tillman will return from resting his sore left ankle either Sunday or Monday.Angels: RHP Jered Weaver is expected to return Sunday.

Yet he overwhelmed the Angels, striking out six and walking one.""I really needed it,"" said Jimenez, who beat the Angels for the first time in his career. ""It\'s not easy coming to the stadium every night knowing you\'re not doing what you\'re supposed to, especially where we are fighting for a wild card. It feels really good to get back on track.""Los Angeles couldn\'t get a runner to third base against Jimenez while getting shut out for the fourth time in 15 games and the ninth time this season.Machado and Caleb Joseph homered, and Jonathan Schoop drove in two runs in the Orioles\' third win in five games. Baltimore scored in five different innings in an 11-hit effort led by Machado, the All-Star with 10 hits in his last five games.""We did a lot of different things to score runs, and those are the things that are going to have to continue if we\'re going to go somewhere this season,"" Machado said.Garrett Richards (11-9) gave up seven hits and three runs over six innings for the Angels. He has taken three losses in four starts for the first time in his major league career.Richards struck out seven, but repeatedly found trouble while giving up at least three runs for the fifth time in six starts. He gave up three earned runs in five of his previous 19 starts dating to last season, which ended early with a knee injury.""It was a battle night,"" Richards said. ""We just didn\'t get it done as a team. That\'s it. On to the next one. We\'ve got 60 games to play, so nobody is scoreboard-watching.""Machado scored on Adam Jones\' grounder in the third in a rally that began with the Angels dropping a catchable pop fly to right. Joseph was tagged out in a rundown at the plate moments earlier.Machado then connected on a full-count pitch in the fifth, driving his 24th homer into the bullpen beyond left field. The homer was the fifth in four starts allowed by Richards, who only gave up five homers all last season.RUNS OFF THE BOARDTrout singled and appeared to score on David Murphy\'s fly in the ninth, but after video review, the umpires ruled the AL MVP slid over the plate and didn\'t touch it before the tag.The Orioles also lost a run at the plate on video appeal in the second inning when umpires saw that Schoop failed to touch home plate while sliding in well ahead of the Angels\' throw.TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: Jason Garcia returned from the 60-day DL on Friday, pitching in the eighth inning of Baltimore\'s loss.Angels: Jered Weaver will return to the rotation Sunday, making his first start in seven weeks due to left hip inflammation.UP NEXTOrioles: Miguel Gonzalez (9-8, 4.32 ERA), who grew up in the San Fernando Valley, has lost his last two starts.Angels: Weaver (4-8, 4.75 ERA) makes his 16th start of the season.

08/10/2015,"[('Orioles Open Series With Mariners In Seattle \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The seesaw of wins and losses has to end at some point for the Baltimore Orioles. Eyeing a postseason push, the Orioles have traded victories and defeats through the first eight games of August. Baltimore looks to shake off its most recent downswing from a walkoff loss to the team its chasing for the second wild-card spot with Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s series opener against the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field. The Orioles (56-54) won six of their final seven games of July but have been unable to carry that success over to this month. They dropped two of three in Anaheim over the weekend and fell three games back of the Angels for a playoff spot with Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 5-4, 11-inning defeat. Baltimore took two of three from Seattle (52-60) in mid-May and this matchup pits southpaws Wei-Yin Chen and Vidal Nuno against each other. Chen (5-6, 3.32 ERA) was Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s top pitcher through the first half of the season, bringing a 2.78 ERA into the All-Star break. He has struggled since with a 6.30 ERA in four starts, allowing 30 hits \xe2\x80\x93 five of them home runs \xe2\x80\x93 in 20 innings. Opponents are batting .353 against Chen since the break, and he has allowed 10 hits twice, a number reached only once in 17 previous appearances. \xe2\x80\x9cEver since the second half started, I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt not as good as the first half so I tried to do a couple different (mechanical) things that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out,\xe2\x80\x9d Chen told MLB\xe2\x80\x99s official website through an interpreter. \xe2\x80\x9cSo now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to keep doing that.\xe2\x80\x9d He has failed to complete six innings in his last three outings, snapping a streak of six-straight quality starts. Chen \xe2\x80\x93 who has matched his loss total from a year ago when he went 16-6 \xe2\x80\x93 surrendered three runs and four hits while walking four in five innings of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 7-3, 12-inning win at Oakland. He went seven innings against Seattle on May 20, yielding four runs in a 4-2 loss. Chen will face a red-hot Nelson Cruz, who extended his league-leading hit streak to 19 games with a solo home run in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-2 win over Texas. The hitting streak ties a career long for Cruz and his homer pulled him even with Mike Trout for the major league lead at 33. Cruz is hitting .422 during his streak with 12 home runs and 16 RBIs. He has an extra-base hit in nine straight, one short of the team record set by Ken Griffey Jr. in 1993. Cruz has seven home runs in that span. He is 2 for 9 with a double lifetime against Chen. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t even know where we would be without him,\xe2\x80\x9d Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said of Cruz. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been tremendous on and off the field.

In his lone start against the Orioles last June, he permitted five runs in 6 1-3 innings. He lasted just 3 2-3 innings on Tuesday as Colorado knocked him around for three runs and five hits. Chris Davis extended his hitting streak to seven games with his 29th home run Sunday. Davis has 10 homers since July 22 and is 2 for 4 against Nuno.

08/12/2015,"[('Orioles-Mariners Preview \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Many of Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s top sluggers are doing their best to try to push the Orioles to their third playoff trip in four years. That effort may be all for naught if the starting rotation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become more consistent. The Orioles hope Kevin Gausman can help get the staff on track Wednesday against the Seattle Mariners. Baltimore (57-55) lost 6-5 in 10 innings Tuesday, missing a chance to gain ground on the Los Angeles Angels, who own a two-game lead over the Orioles for the second AL wild-card spot, but also lost. The Orioles have 20 homers and 22 doubles over their last 12 games, with Chris Davis batting .364 with seven home runs and 18 RBIs. Jonathan Schoop is batting .364 in that span, while Manny Machado is at .358. Despite hitting .235, Adam Jones has 11 RBIs. Davis and Jones hit back-to-back homers in the eighth inning to rally the Orioles and help overcome a poor start by Chris Tillman, who gave up five runs in 2 1-3 innings. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s rotation owns a 6.02 ERA during this 6-6 stretch, and its starters have lasted 4 2-3 innings or fewer five times. The Orioles could be without another hot bat in Matt Wieters after he left in the third inning with a strained hamstring and was replaced by Caleb Joseph. Wieters, who missed 181 games from 2014-15 after undergoing Tommy John surgery, was hitting .383 in his last 13 after going 1 for 2 Tuesday. Joseph is batting .333 over his last 14. Manager Buck Showalter is taking a cautious approach with his catcher and likely will rest him for this game ahead of an off day Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cIt tightened up a bit, then it got worse as the game went on,\xe2\x80\x9d Wieters told MLB\xe2\x80\x99s official website. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we caught it before anything would be serious.\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman (2-3, 4.56 ERA) might need lots of help from Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s bats if his road struggles continue. He\xe2\x80\x99s 0-3 with an 8.41 ERA in four games and had another tough outing Friday against the Angels, surrendering six runs and a career high-matching nine hits over 6 2-3 innings in an 8-4 defeat. But for all of his problems away from home this year, he fared well in his only previous start at Seattle, giving up one run over 6 2-3 innings in a 2-1, 10-inning victory July 25, 2014. Robinson Cano, who is hitting .364 in his last eight games, is 4 for 6 against Gausman. Nelson Cruz exited in the seventh inning due to neck spasms, but not before extending his hitting streak to a major league season high-matching 21 games for the Mariners (53-61). Cruz, who hit his major league-leading 34th homer, is batting .411 with 13 homers during that run. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just kind of stiff, the neck,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnybody can get that. I was sitting there and I felt the cramps.\xe2\x80\x9d Hisashi Iwakuma (3-2, 4.41) is 3-1 with a 3.00 ERA over his last six starts, completing at least seven innings four times. He\xe2\x80\x99s had trouble this year after logging high pitch counts, however, and Seattle hopes that trend doesn\xe2\x80\x99t continue after he threw a career-high 118 in Friday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-3 win against Texas. He allowed a combined right runs over 11 1-3 innings in his two starts immediately following his previous 100-pitch outings this year. Iwakuma is 0-2 with a 3.66 ERA in three starts against Baltimore, getting one run of support in 19 2-3 innings.

Yet, Alvarez has a very transparent weakness. He cannot take a walk.In the MLB, the league average for the walk percentage statistic\xc2\xa0is 7.5%. Dariel Alvarez has walked in only\xc2\xa03.08% of his plate appearances this season. And that\xe2\x80\x99s in the MINOR LEAGUES.This is not to say that pitchers in AAA are terrible, but how do we expect him to improve this stat in the major leagues?In the pros, a pitcher will make you look silly if he realizes that you do not know your way around the strike zone. I think Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 GM Dan Duquette is well-aware of this.To further this argument is the fact that Alvarez finds himself lugging around a poor .300 OBP. It is one thing to have an on base percentage like this when you\xe2\x80\x99re hitting in the low .200\xe2\x80\x99s, but Alvarez has an average that is just 29 points lower than his OBP.This may be confusing if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t a stat guru, so let\xe2\x80\x99s put this into perspective.\xc2\xa0Nolan Reimold and Travis Snider have an\xc2\xa0OBP higher than .300 in THE PROS this season.Not good news for Alvarez.If you\xe2\x80\x99ve followed the O\xe2\x80\x99s this season, you know that plate discipline is something that has haunted the team, with first-pitch pop-outs and three-pitch K\xe2\x80\x99s writing the script for a large number of their losses.I like Alvarez, and I think his high power and moderate\xc2\xa0average could allow him to be a scaled-down version of\xc2\xa0Chris Davis starting in 2016 or 2017.

This is a sort of game the 2012 and 2014 Orioles would have captured.It is difficult to make many evaluative statements about Chris Tillman. He is coming back from the injury time away due to the turned ankle in his last start at the end of July. One thing is certain about Tillman: he is a creature of habit and functions best on a very strict schedule of rest days. It seems like any disruption of that timing means the internal clock needs to be re-set. It might not be surprising if he comes out with a good game the next time around. In any event, that is what the Orioles are going to need if there is any chance of catching the teams ahead of them.Matt Wieters was also injured in the game and needed to be replaced. The issue is a hamstring \xe2\x80\xa6 to be evaluated Wednesday.The Orioles are really, really going to need Kevin Gausman to have a strong outing against the Mariners. He is going to have to pitch deep into the game whether he is getting shelled or not.The price of optimism is going up at about the same rate as the price of oil is falling these days.

Baltimore defeated Seattle, 3-2/ Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles enter today into a four-game set at home against the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s. The Western road trip with a 4-5 record leaves the Orioles at 57-56 on the season, facing a final 49 games. The O\xe2\x80\x99s could still put a big close on the season and get into the playoffs, etc., etc. But the fact is that right now in the middle of August they are essentially a .500 team.This is not what we thought we were going to see in 2015. Remember the offense taken by O\xe2\x80\x99s fans and writers when so many \xe2\x80\x9cexperts\xe2\x80\x9d out there in the broader baseball world predicted the Birds to be a .500 sort of team and finish in the middle of the pack? How could they say this about a team that had the entire starting rotation returning from a 96-win season?It pretty much comes down to two trains of thought to explain this mediocrity. It is either the failure of the ownership/management to build a sufficient winning roster, or the players on the roster are significantly underperforming relative to expectations.The Insufficient Roster TheoryThis of course relates to three players in particular who were not re-signed after strong 2014 results: Nick Markakis, Nelson Cruz and Andrew Miller. Each of the three have had fine seasons again this year, although Cruz and Markakis are on teams in far worse condition than the Orioles relative to playoff aspirations. More from Baltimore Orioles5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen workThough the Orioles bullpen (or any bullpen) would be better with Andrew Miller, the relievers have had a very effective season again for the O\xe2\x80\x99s (after a bad start in April). It is the corner outfield and DH spots in the lineup that have not been replaced sufficiently.Without doubt, no player given a chance to take a regular corner outfield or DH position has risen to \xe2\x80\x9ctake\xe2\x80\x9d it. The cast of characters has been immense, and to name a few: Alejandro De Aza, Travis Snider, Chris Parmelee, Delmon Young, Nolan Reimold, David Lough, Jimmy Paredes; and even the highly-touted Gerardo Parra is only .196 since joining the Birds. Chris Davis has more recently been sent to the outfield to attempt to address the problem.How bad are the numbers?\xc2\xa0 For left field it is particularly dismal, as the Orioles are only getting a .198 average from that position, which is the worst in the league. Right field is much better, perhaps surprisingly so, as a .281 average is third in the league. For DH, the situation is more in the middle of the pack. The Orioles rank ninth in the league with a .252 average, whereas the league average is .261.I believe it was a reasonable expectation that one from the list of players above would have stepped up enough to have a strong season. But none have. They were not going to replicate a 2014 Nelson Cruz power year, but surely they should have done better than what has happened.The Underperforming Players TheoryNot every last player on any team is going to have a top 10% production career-year at the same time. But a winning outfit needs a sizeable number of players to do just that in order to carry the team to the top of the standings.Without doubt, there have been some poor performances in 2015. It is great that Chris Davis has heated up considerably to be among the home run and RBI leaders in the league. But he was pretty absent early in the year. J.J. Hardy is simply not having a great offensive year by any measure other than clutch hits, and that seems to be diminishing as well. Matt Wieters has not come back strong enough to give consistent contributions. Steve Pearce is not the same person as a year ago. And Ryan Flaherty is \xe2\x80\xa6 well, you know \xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99ve jumped on him enough; but he has sadly again proven my point.Relative to pitchers, it is great to have Ubaldo Jimenez living up to expectations, but Bud Norris was a total disaster, while Chris Tillman hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a top-drawer starter other than for a very short and recent window of time. Chen is improved, but Miguel Gonzalez is getting hit harder of late and has been inconsistent.The Combination TheoryIt is a combination of both elements. I am no Duquette defender, but I do lay the greater blame on the lack of performance from those who reasonably had a solid enough career resume to have played much better.Looking back, the Orioles needed at least one corner outfielder who could have performed above the league average.\xc2\xa0 There is no doubt now that having Markakis or Cruz would had made the Orioles a better 2015 team with a better record. However, the issue of evaluating whether the four-year contracts were wise to be rejected has to play out over a longer time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the four years are going to prove to be worth the money given to either player. One of these players might have pushed the O\xe2\x80\x99s high enough to have made the Wild Card Playoffs, but then the team might have been one and out, and the Orioles would be stuck with a long-term, bad contract.I still lay the greater percentage of the blame on the players not performing, maybe about 75 to 25% versus the roster not being re-built. This roster should be well better than 57-56, that is for sure.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore45m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

It\xe2\x80\x99s really no different than matching up righty/righty or lefty/lefty.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsBut you\xe2\x80\x99re also opening up a hole, which makes it much more difficult for a player to have to adjust on the fly. Last night there was a flailing pop which would have normally been a fairly routine play for Manny Machado. He was able to deflect the ball with the tip of his glove, but it ticked away. Machado had shifted around into the shortstop position, and had to glide all the way back over to the line.Luckily that didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt the Orioles, however the point is that the shifts can often turn routine plays into fluky things which can often cost teams games. Even in the ninth inning; the O\xe2\x80\x99s were playing your typical \xe2\x80\x9cno doubles defense,\xe2\x80\x9d which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even take into account that a guy could get on base with an infield single.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsIn what was one of the more entertaining Baltimore Orioles games of the 2015 season, the O\xe2\x80\x99s finally prevailed 8-6 in the bottom of the 13th inning on a walk-off two-run homer by #13 Manny Machado.This was a game that the Orioles deserved to win. In fact, they had it won \xe2\x80\xa6 all except for the final out in the ninth inning. Zach Britton suffered only his second blown save of the season in this his 45th appearance. His only other BS was on April 25th.Speaking of BS, that is exactly what happened to Britton in the ninth inning. Two crap hits \xe2\x80\x93 infield chops that were beaten out for singles \xe2\x80\x93 were followed by two more infield chops to score a run before finally a legit base hit knocked in the tying run.Britton\xe2\x80\x99s stuff is so good that is could almost be classified as \xe2\x80\x9ctoo good.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Those upper 90s sinkers end up so often being drilled into the ground and creating underserved 40-foot infield hits. Giving up two runs and being charged with a blown save on this night was one of the more unjust things I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in baseball.

It was a strange outing for the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitcher. His stuff looked to have good movement, although the command was definitely off. Jimenez gave up four runs on nine hits and two walks. He spent much of the night pitching out of the stretch, throwing 48 of his 102 pitches with runners on base.The Orioles simply could not tolerate a loss to open this 10-game homestand. They could not bear to fall any farther behind in the A.L. East (even though the Jays did lose to the Yankees \xe2\x80\x93 no kidding!).Inside information here about writing: I am often writing the recap of the game before it ends, presuming a current score is more likely to stand than it is to change \xe2\x80\xa6 especially with Zach Britton coming into the game. So the original headline for a nine-inning win was going to be, \xe2\x80\x9cBaltimore Orioles: Adam Jones \xe2\x80\x93 HR #20 is HR #1.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 A three-run shot in the fifth inning from Jones truly breathed new life into a team that was about to go under the waves for the last time.Jones would get a fourth RBI on a sac fly to tie the game in the bottom of the seventh, just before Chris Davis would hit a monster shot \xe2\x80\x94 his 32nd \xe2\x80\x94 to put the Orioles in a position to win the game.Perhaps the best inning put in by any Orioles pitcher (and most of them made it into the game!) was the 13th inning by Jason Garcia. He threw three consecutive ground balls on only six pitches to register his first career win. Oh my, the anger and angst that would have come forth from Orioles fans if the Rule 5 pitcher had blown the game. The frustration would have filled the comment boards that the O\xe2\x80\x99s had truly sunk the season by carrying a pitcher who could not be counted upon in a pennant race.Could this win be THE MOMENT?\xc2\xa0 Could it be the start of a final-third stretch such as carried the Birds into the playoffs in 2012 and 2014? That would be a great thing.Next: How to explain a merely .500 Orioles team ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Mucho magic by Manny Machado', ""Make no mistake about the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s a very fine line between winning and losing, and Manny Machado along with his Baltimore Orioles teammates would be the first one to tell you that. By virtue of last night\xe2\x80\x99s 8-6 victory over Oakland, Orioles fans are probably thinking to themselves\xc2\xa0wow what a huge win this morning. However from Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s standpoint they\xe2\x80\x99re thinking to themselves\xc2\xa0that\xe2\x80\x99s a devastating loss. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not even talking about the standings \xe2\x80\x93 just the ebb and flow of the game.Ubaldo Jimenez failed to produce a quality start last night. However he did have zip on his fastball and he put his team in a position to win. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 9 H, 4 R, 2 BB, 6 K. Coco Crisp gave Oakland a 1-0 lead in the second with a bloop RBI-single, and Billy Burns followed suit with an infield RBI-single in the fourth (which came with two outs, and a second run was gunned down at the plate to end the inning).\xc2\xa0Live Feed manny machadoBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenManny Machado mashes ball over Green Monster (Video) FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red Sox Call to the PenChris Sale reportedly to be suspended by MLB FanSidedBoston Red Sox Attempt to Hit Manny Machado--Again Call to the PenManny Machado rips the Red Sox for throwing behind him in NSFW rant FanSidedAt that point you had to feel like it was last year\xe2\x80\x99s ALCS all over again; Oakland hadn\xe2\x80\x99t hit the ball hard in the least, and they had two runs on two fluky plays. And here the Orioles are trying to tear the cover off of the ball, and to use a fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s term they were\xc2\xa0getting stones. But baseball has a way of humbling people at times, and the Birds have certainly found that out this past week. But for good measure, Stephen Vogt\xe2\x80\x98s two-run homer in the fifth gave Oakland a 4-0 lead.The Orioles have very little margin for error, and here they are down by four to a team that\xe2\x80\x99s going nowhere. To top it off, they looked like they might have some life in the fifth after Junior Lake\xe2\x80\x98s lead off double. However while he advanced to third on a sacrifice, the O\xe2\x80\x99s recorded two quick outs. Gerardo Parra was then hit by a pitch to put runners at the corners. That\xe2\x80\x99s when things began to swing back in the right direction for the Orioles. Adam Jones took a strike, and then he proceeded to smack a deep shot into the Baltimore night. When it landed it the grandstand, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had cut the lead to 4-3 and were right back in the game.Jones would also add a sac fly-RBI in the last of the seventh, which brought Chris Davis up to bat with a runner on second. On a 2-2 count, Davis was sitting on a fastball \xe2\x80\x93 and he got it. You know the old sayin\xe2\x80\xa6if it\xe2\x80\x99s high, let it fly! That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Davis did, and his homer landed on Eutwaw Street and gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 6-4 lead. So\xe2\x80\xa6game over, right?Let\xe2\x80\x99s be very clear; Zach Britton got credit with a blown save, but in reality he didn\xe2\x80\x99t blow the save. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 inability to defend against fluky plays reared it\xe2\x80\x99s ugly head once again, as the first two Oakland hitters got on base due to infield hits. Pinch-hitter Josh Phegley\xe2\x80\x98s fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice-RBI allowed one run to score to cut the lead to 6-5. With two outs, a two-strike count, and a runner at third former Oriole Danny Valencia\xe2\x80\x98s soft RBI-single tied the game at six.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

You can chalk that blown save up to bad luck for Zach Britton. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost as if teams know that they can get away with scoring runs in that manner against the O\xe2\x80\x99s. But it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how they\xe2\x80\x99re able to induce bloops or anything else. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I use the term\xc2\xa0fluky plays. And incidentally, the Orioles traded Valencia for David Lough \xe2\x80\x93 who was DFA\xe2\x80\x99d yesterday. Go figure.But the one good thing for the O\xe2\x80\x99s was that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to play catch-up in the last of the ninth or in extras. Bear in mind, Oakland was playing with a shortened bullpen already. And as much as I wrote about the Birds being at a disadvantage during the west coast trip in terms of being so far away from their affiliates, the same is now true of Oakland. While both teams had base runners, nobody was able to score as the game became a teenager and went to the thirteenth\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and with one out in the last of the inning Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x98s double put him in scoring position. The Oakland trainer immediately came out and pitcher Drew Pomeranz was lifted due to an apparent injury. HeCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportswas replaced by starter Aaron Brooks \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure when these extra inning games go into the \xe2\x80\x9ctwilight zone phase,\xe2\x80\x9d but when a starting pitcher has to come out of the bullpen that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good indication. And he already had a runner in scoring position at that.And perhaps it was fitting that the \xe2\x80\x9cMucho Man,\xe2\x80\x9d Manny Machado, would then just decide to end the game with a two-run homer on a 1-1 count. I mean, what the heck \xe2\x80\x93 right?! While it took longer than one would have expected, this was a game that the Orioles couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lost. And they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. The Birds now find themselves five games out of first, and only two back for the wild card.Bear in mind that Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen was already at a disadvantage coming into the game last night, and now after being taxed in a game like that things look even worse for them \xe2\x80\x93 and they\xe2\x80\x99re a world away from their minor league affiliates. The series continues tonight, as Miguel Gonzalez heads to the mound for the Orioles. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Bassitt.

Davis is listed as a position player on the roster. The Orioles won 18-2. (AP Photo/Nick Wass)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Bob Melvin had just spent the better part of three hours watching the Oakland Athletics stumble through an embarrassing defeat, and the manager wasn\'t about to let his players escape with just a shower and a bite to eat.Melvin gathered the squad together in the closed clubhouse to discuss some of the low points of Sunday\'s 18-2 loss to the Baltimore Orioles.""We had a little meeting,"" Melvin said. ""We haven\'t had too many of those (lopsided losses). You\'re going to have some during the course of the season; sometimes it ends up exposing some things that need to be talked about.""The pitching was awful, the offense ineffective and the defense porous. Although Oakland was not charged with an error, a few balls dropped between two players who appeared uncertain who was supposed to catch them.""At times guys were having a hard time seeing the ball off the bat,"" Melvin said. ""Some of the jumps in the outfield would suggest that they didn\'t see it right away.""Perhaps, but on one occasion Coco Crisp and shortstop Marcus Semien collided in short left field.""I think Coco tried to call him off and Marcus didn\'t hear him,"" Melvin said.The Orioles tied a franchise record with 26 hits. The barrage began against Kendall Graveman (6-9), who allowed six runs in 3 1-3 innings.""I take full responsibility for what happened out there today,"" the right-hander said. ""It kind of got out of hand early.""Homers by Gerardo Parra and Adam Jones off Graveman helped put Baltimore up 6-1 in the third, and a nine-run, 10-hit fifth erased any lingering suspense.The A\'s ran through five pitchers before turning to first baseman Ike Davis, who took the mound for the second time this season. He allowed a single and a walk in a scoreless eighth.Baltimore will try for a sweep on Monday night. The Orioles haven\'t swept a four-game series from Oakland since 1987 and have never accomplished the feat in Baltimore.Facing the Athletics, who own the AL\'s worst record, has greatly enhanced Baltimore\'s playoff chances. By going 5-1 against Oakland this month, the Orioles have moved within four games of the Yankees in the AL East and are in the thick of the wild-card race.""We can control our own destiny,"" Jones said. ""Just go out and win games.""Eight players had multihit games for the Orioles. Jones went 3 for 4, Parra matched his career high with five hits and Caleb Joseph homered and had a career-high four RBIs. Steve Clevenger contributed a career-high four hits, and Manny Machado had three hits and three RBIs.The beneficiary of the relentless attack was Wei-Yin Chen (7-6), who gave up two runs and eight hits in six innings. The Taiwanese left-hander is 5-0 with a 2.30 ERA in seven career starts against Oakland.Brett Lawrie homered for the A\'s, who have dropped 10 of 11 on the road, including a season-high seven straight.Oakland trailed 6-2 before Baltimore sent 13 players to the plate in the fifth. The key blows were a two-run single by Henry Urrutia, a two-run double by Machado and a two-run homer by Jones.""It was more like follow the leader,"" Jones said.REVERSE ORDERHaving a pitcher face a position player is nothing new, except in the eighth inning Davis ended up pitching to Orioles pitcher Jason Garcia, who had been inserted in the DH spot. Garcia walked on four pitches.""He wasn\'t supposed to swing there,"" Showalter said, ""but he put his batting gloves on for the photo op.""TRAINER\'S ROOMAthletics: RHP Sonny Gray will start Monday night after being sidelined since Aug. 7 with back spasms. He won\'t be limited by a pitch count. ""If that were the case we probably would give it more time,"" Melvin said.Orioles: C Matt Wieters missed a fourth straight game with a strained right hamstring.ON DECKAthletics: Gray (12-4, 2.06 ERA) has accounted for nearly a fourth of Oakland\'s 51 wins.Orioles: Chris Tillman (8-7, 4.66 ERA) enters the series finale having won six straight decisions since May 31.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

Yes folks, you read that correctly \xe2\x80\x93 a nine-run fifth inning. This of course was an Oakland team that had given the Orioles fits the past two nights, with the O\xe2\x80\x99s having to win in walk off fashion in both games. This afternoon that most certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary.Wei-Yin Chen lasted only six innings, but mainly because if there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that Oakland did well today it was to foul pitches off. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 8 H, 2 R, 0 BB, 7 K. However this game was decided well before Chen departed the game, and it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible that these past few days in and of themselves might have even altered the destiny of the 2015 Orioles.

However for a brief moment, it appeared that Oakland would continue giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s fits, as Sam Fuld\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-double in the second tied the game at one. The O\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0did make\xc2\xa0what appeared to be a base running mistake in the last of the third, which in the past has come back to haunt them. With runners at the corners and one down, Henry Urrutia hit a Baltimore chop in the infield. Jonathan Schoop was caught off the bag at third, and eventually was tagged out.Careless play by Schoop, right? He potentially could have scored on that play first off, but then ended up recording an out. However he did a very smart thing, and engaged the Oakland infield in a rundown. That allowed both base runners to move into scoring position with Caleb Joseph coming to the plate. And Joseph sent a two-RBI double to left field, which was followed by RBI-singles by Manny Machado and Parra (whoCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportshad already homered). When the dust cleared, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a 5-1 lead\xe2\x80\xa6that is until Adam Jones made it 6-1 with his first home run (a solo shot) of the day.And they never looked back \xe2\x80\x93 short of Brett Lawrie\xe2\x80\x98s solo homer in the fourth. But it was smooth sailing from that point onwards\xe2\x80\xa6for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, that is. Then came the fifth inning, which as a spectacle not often seen in Birdland \xe2\x80\x93 or anywhere for that matter.Chris Davis started things off with an RBI-single, which was followed by a Steve Clevenger ground out that yielded a run. Urrutia would add a two-RBI single, and then the Oakland defense started giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s some additional help. Manny Machado popped up towards Coco Crisp in left; however Crisp appeared never\xc2\xa0 call off SS Marcus Semien, who kept moving to the ball, which fell in between them and allowed two runs to score. It went as an RBI-double, however that\xe2\x80\x99s an unforced error on Crisp. Infielders are taught to keep playing the ball until they\xe2\x80\x99re called off by an outfielder \xe2\x80\x93 Crisp never called Semien off.

However with that fifth inning still cooking, Parra (who went 5-for-6 on the day) added an RBI-double, followed by Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 second home run of the day. This one was of the two-run variety, and it closed out the scoring in that fifth inning with the Orioles ahead 15-2. All in all, the Birds put nine on the board and sent 13 men to the plate in the inning.The wind was out of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s sails by then, and even the Orioles looked like they were ready to go home. But they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do so until Caleb Joseph added a two-run homer of his own in the last of the sixth, and Henry Urrutia added one final run with an RBI-single in the seventh. Towards the end Buck Showalter started shuffling around the lineup\xc2\xa0 as to give the regulars some additional rest. So rule 5 pick Jason Garcia came in, and Steve Clevenger moved over to first base. This meant that the O\xe2\x80\x99s surrendered their DH, and Garcia had to hit in the eighth.To top it off, infielder Ike Davis was brought in to pitch for Oakland (presumably in a move to save the bullpen). So imagine the irony of having a relief pitcher with his first big league at-bat (he drew a walk), and he was pitched to by a position player. Baseball is a funny game at times.As much as the no-hitter last week was only one game, so is this. However the O\xe2\x80\x99s appear to be getting hot at the right time. Incidentally, they also tied a club record with 26 hits in the game. The series concludes tomorrow night with Chris Tillman on the mound for the Orioles. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s Sonny Gray.

08/17/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Offensive Woes of J.J. Hardy', ""May 23, 2015; Miami, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy (2) slides into third base during the second inning against the Miami Marlins at Marlins Park. Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY SportsBefore I get into some thoughts and analysis of Baltimore Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy and his recent offensive difficulties, let me set that up by giving a personal illustration.I\xe2\x80\x99m an old guy, as sportswriters go \xe2\x80\x94 age 60. And though I blame bad genetics more than my marathon-running younger life for my arthritic knee, frankly, the only running I do these days is from the orthopedic surgeon who wants to replace it. Gross! So, I limp around a bit.Sometimes the knee does not hurt practically at all. And I make a mental note of how it is a good day and it is great to be able to walk without pain. I have several times had the experience of walking into a building while thinking to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re walking well today \xe2\x80\x94 no limp at all\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 only to have the first person I see say to me, \xe2\x80\x9cSo what are you limping about?\xe2\x80\x9dTo me (and to many other O\xe2\x80\x99s fans I\xe2\x80\x99ve read on comment boards), it pretty much always looks like J.J. Hardy is hurting. We know he has a bad back that has afflicted him at times. And frequently when running out a ground ball, he decelerates beyond the bag in a way that looks like he is attempting to alleviate pangs of pain shooting through his spinal column. He is also frequently seen stretching and twisting \xe2\x80\x94 sorta checking out that muscle he just tweaked a moment ago.But, maybe this is just normal for Hardy. Maybe on his best day he simply has a running style and physical presence that gives a false appearance that not everything is well inside his age 33 (on Wednesday) body.Adding to this illusion (or appearance) are certain times where he seems to go into a hitting funk \xe2\x80\xa6 like, right now, for example. Hardy did have a 15-game hitting streak from July 17th through August 1st where he hit .291.\xc2\xa0 But for the month of August (13 games) he is just 8-for-51 \xe2\x80\x94 seven singles and a double with one run scored and one RBI. And in the last eight games he is just 2-for-30.Here are his stats month by month for 2015 \xe2\x80\xa6MonthGABH2BHRRBIAVGMay238816126.190June2584275112.307July2591202411.220August13518101.157Total86314719730.226\xc2\xa0Also adding to the concern is the knowledge of certain injury proclivities \xe2\x80\x94 both from last year and from spring training. Hardy did not begin the season with the O\xe2\x80\x99s this year until May 7th.

Of course, he is among the very best of defensive shortstops and contributes to the team by preventing run-scoring situations for the opposition. He has only three errors in 86 games. As well, over the past couple years, Hardy has delivered well in clutch situations \xe2\x80\x94 among the very best. However, this stat has also seen some erosion of late and is now down to .282.The Orioles could give him a break and let Flaherty play some games, but that would be turning to a player who is 0-for-34 since his last hit on July 24th.\xc2\xa0And in fact, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are 48-38 when he plays.And actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m not calling for any necessary action to be taken, other than definitely keeping him well down the batting order. There just is the concern that Hardy is playing through injuries to the extent that it is affecting him terribly. Buck always talks about how everyone is playing with some sort of nagging issue.Actually, I would make one observation that seems to me to be an obvious batting adjustment that could be made. I would like to see Hardy move up on the plate a bit closer. He is often lunging to cover the outside of the plate, and teams pitch him there with low, breaking balls in particular. With his open stance, though this might invite getting busted up and in, he would be better positioned to turn on such pitches and pull them down the line. As it is, he is hitting far too many ground balls that he \xe2\x80\x9cturns over\xe2\x80\x9d and results in one out, if not two.But, I\xe2\x80\x99m just an old dude with a bad knee, but the eyes are still good. And Hardy will likely turn this around again as he has many other times in his career. But the eyes tell me now that not all is well physically with the O\xe2\x80\x99s shortstop and that the numbers are reflecting this.Next: Orioles bury Graveman and every other A's PitcherMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore46m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: How poor can the AL East really be?', 'Let\xe2\x80\x99s just say up front here that the season isn\xe2\x80\x99t over for the Baltimore Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 or anyone else for that matter.

So that means that if the season were to end today (which again folks, it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet remotely over), New York would win the AL East and the O\xe2\x80\x99s would have to travel to Toronto to play in the AL Wild Card game \xe2\x80\x93 yes, as the visitor.If that scenario ended up being the final result, I think a lot of fans would just assume that the season was over since Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s such a tough place for the Orioles to play. Maybe it would be over, but maybe not as well \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s the fun in an automatic elimination game. However that\xe2\x80\x99s not my point here this morning; is it not lost on people that the two wild card teams as of the moment this article is being written are AL East teams?Basically, there would be three AL East teams going to the playoffs if the season ended today. Unless of course that ends up being the final result, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to look back and mention that on August 17th this was the case. However the point is that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that a lot of people misjudged this division. When you have five teams in the division and three of them are in the push for the playoffs, if anything they might be the creme de la creme of the league \xe2\x80\x93 not the dregs.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to call the AL East the best division in the game either, but my point is that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a pushover division like the national media wanted to play up earlier in the year. We were led to believe that the Orioles were only the champions of the east last year because\xc2\xa0someone had to win it, and that this year\xe2\x80\x99s champion would be in the same boat. Again bear in mind that these teams will be playing each other a lot in September. That will truly decide who goes to the post season and who stays home. But needless to say, the AL East is better than they were being given credit for being.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Is Toronto really that good?More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Some people might not make much out of the fact that Clevenger is a Baltimore native. However keep in mind that it\xe2\x80\x99s rare in sports to see a guy playing for his hometown team. Baltimore of course had the luxury of having it\xe2\x80\x99s true hometown hero, the great Cal Ripken\xc2\xa0Jr. star here for quite some time. But again, he\xe2\x80\x99s the exception \xe2\x80\x93 and Clevenger is nowhere near the player that Cal was.

Parnell was obviously still feeling the effects of Tommy John surgery. He might not feel pain, Collins told him, but it was natural for him to need time to regain his touch.And the Mets are not in a position to wait. They are trying to hold off the Washington Nationals, win the National League East and earn their first playoff berth since 2006.The Mets placed Parnell, a respected veteran reliever, on the disabled list Tuesday with what they called right shoulder tendinitis and, having been swept over the weekend by the Pittsburgh Pirates, held a team meeting to refocus themselves and prepare for the season\xe2\x80\x99s final six weeks.Then the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 best two relievers almost blew a four-run ninth-inning lead. Jeurys Familia, the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 first-time closer, pitching in his first pennant race, walked in two runners with the bases loaded before retiring Manny Machado to finish off a 5-3 win over the Baltimore Orioles.

Credit             Elsa/Getty Images           DeGrom dominated the Orioles the same way he had most every team he had faced this year, locating his pitches with precision. He had the Orioles so flummoxed that Adam Jones, their No. 3 hitter and a perennial All-Star, tried to bunt for a base hit.DeGrom was only at 100 pitches, too, when Collins came to retrieve him in the eighth, with two outs and a runner on first.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  DeGrom had lowered his E.R.A. to 1.98, the second-lowest qualifying mark in the majors, behind only Zack Greinke\xe2\x80\x99s 1.58. But Gerardo Parra was coming to bat, and he had hit a solo home run off deGrom in his previous at-bat. The many Mets fans in attendance here gave deGrom a standing ovation as he left the mound.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cI felt like I could keep going,\xe2\x80\x9d deGrom said later.Instead, Tyler Clippard came on, and Parra hit a fly ball to the warning track, which required Curtis Granderson to make a leaping catch to preserve a 3-1 lead. By the time Clippard took the mound for the bottom of the ninth, the Mets had extended their lead to 5-1.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Mets looked well in control at that point. In the third inning, Daniel Murphy had doubled, driving in Wilmer Flores from first base in part because Orioles second baseman Jonathan Schoop had dropped the relay throw. Michael Conforto had gunned out a runner at home plate in the fifth. Curtis Granderson had hit two solo home runs, and the Mets had tacked on two runs in the ninth thanks to an error by Schoop.

He had been charged with two losses in the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 last three games, his E.R.A. had ballooned to 5.59, and Mets fans had viciously booed him. With Parnell on the disabled list, Collins said, he can work with the pitching coach Dan Warthen and tweak his mechanics away from the spotlight of a playoff race, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout having to jeopardize anything.\xe2\x80\x9dReinforcing the bullpen will be one of the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 most important challenges down the stretch. The back end is usually sturdy, with Clippard and Familia handling the eighth and ninth innings. But Collins acknowledged that he would have to mix and match in the seventh, depending on the matchups or whether a young reliever asserted himself.One candidate may be Logan Verrett, the player the Mets promoted to replace Parnell on the roster. In 17 bullpen appearances this year, between the majors and the minors, Verrett, a third-round draft pick in 2011, has posted a 2.36 E.R.A. But the Mets have jostled him between starting and relieving so much that his role remains unclear.Verrett, 25, may ultimately be a spot starter. Collins indicated that Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard could skip starts in September in order to comply with their inning limits. Given how the Mets handled deGrom on Tuesday, it looks as though they will proceed with caution.

Buschmann started his career with the single-A teams in the Padres organization, but has spent most of his career jumping back-and-forth between the Double and Triple-A ranks. Buschmann has spent this season with both triple-A Durham and triple-A Louisville.Currently, Buschmann is rocking a 4.09 ERA on his career, with an 84-69 record since 2006. This season, Buschmann was 6-5, with a 3.89 ERA with Triple-A Durham, and was 2-5, with a 4.25 ERA with Triple-A Louisville.Buschmann brings a lot of experience into a fairly younger organization with the Orioles. Even though he has never experienced baseball at the major league level, Buschmann can bring immediate success into the organization. Buschmann will be reporting to the Orioles triple-A club, the Norfolk Tides.\xc2\xa0RH Reliever Jason Stoffel \xe2\x80\x93Stoffel was the San Francisco Giants 4th round pick in the 2009 draft, and has spent most of his career in the Giants organization, before being traded to the Astros.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles\' resurgent offense proved to be no match for the one of the most effective pitchers in the major leagues.Jacob deGrom took a four-hitter into the eighth inning, Curtis Granderson hit two solo homers and the New York Mets beat the Orioles 5-3 Tuesday night to snap Baltimore\'s four-game winning streak.The Orioles scored 34 runs in sweeping the Oakland Athletics, but their bats were rendered powerless by deGrom, who allowed one run and five hits over 7 2-3 innings.Chris Davis struck out three times, Adam Jones didn\'t hit the ball out of the infield and Jonathan Schoop went 0 for 3.""He\'s got a good arm. Can throw all four pitches,"" Schoop said. ""He\'s sitting at mid 90s, can reach upper 90s with his fastball, and it moves.""Granderson connected off Kevin Gausman (2-5) on the game\'s second pitch, and deGrom made the lead stand for the first-place Mets.

No questions,"" manager Terry Collins said. ""I\'ve talked to too many other managers and he\'s one of the first guys they ask about.""Because a sizable portion of the crowd of 34,068 backed the Mets, deGrom received a loud ovation when he walked off the mound with a 3-1 lead in the eighth.Tyler Clippard entered with a runner on first, and Parra hit a liner to right. Granderson backed up, jumped and caught the ball at the warning track.After New York added two runs in the ninth, Jeurys Familia entered with two on and one out in the bottom half. He issued two straight bases-loaded walks before retiring Manny Machado on a grounder for his 33rd save.Daniel Murphy had two doubles and two RBIs for the Mets, the only team in the NL East with a winning record. Despite dropping three straight to the Pirates over the weekend, New York is 11-5 in August.Following a 46-minute delay, during which the tarp covered the infield in preparation of a shower that never arrived, Granderson hit his franchise-record seventh leadoff homer of the season, breaking a tie with Jose Reyes (2006).Murphy delivered a two-out RBI double in the third and Granderson hit his 22nd homer in the fifth just over the outstretched glove of a leaping Jones in center field.Gausman allowed three runs, six hits and a walk in six innings.STAT PACKMets: Granderson has 16 RBIs in his last 16 games.

08/20/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Long Road of Henry Urrutia', 'Aug 19, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles left fielder Henry Urrutia (51) hits a walk off home run during the ninth inning against the New York Mets at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Baltimore Orioles defeated New York Mets 5-4. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsIt is difficult to contemplate a more fantastic story than that of Henry Urrutia and the joy of his walk-off home run for the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday evening over the New York Mets, 5-4.\xc2\xa0 It was the first home run of his career for the 28-year-old Cuban defector.Things have come slowly in life for Urrutia. It has been a long and circuitous road that has now landed him in OPACY with the chance to hit a long ball and circle the bases.Even defecting did not work out for him the first time that he attempted it in 2010. He successfully did just less than four years ago, going to Haiti. But immigration issues piled up and it was 2013 before he could begin his baseball career again.He began at AA Bowie where he batted .365 in 52 games with seven home runs. He was moved up to AAA where, after a short adjustment, he batted .316 in 29 games with a pair of homers.

In 24 games he batted .276, showing an ability to hit the opposite way with many singles through the left side of the infield.Next came the Arizona Fall League. Urrutia hit .377 and was third overall in league batting.Unfortunately, 2014 happened. Urrutia hit .262 in spring training but did not inspire sufficiently to make the Baltimore Orioles roster heading north. The disappointment was obvious and hit him hard.He got off to a bad start at Norfolk. He was batting a paltry .220 at the end of April. And then a sports hernia injury took him out for all of May and June. He came back to play for the Gulf Coast Orioles team and only hit .230 there.Finally in August, Urrutia was moved back to the Tides. There he did hit .310 for the final month of the season, salvaging something of worth from his 2014 efforts.Urrutia again had a good spring training in 2015, but the Orioles had plans for quite a number of outfielders ahead of him \xe2\x80\xa6 guys with the last names of Lough, De Aza, Snider, Young \xe2\x80\xa6 guys who are now all gone. But Urrutia remains.Could this be the beginning of a long-term outfield assignment for him with the O\xe2\x80\x99s? Clearly his defense has improved. He still hits the ball to left field a lot (including his first home run), but I have never understood why this has been criticized by many. I remember a fellow named Rod Carew who did this all the time. His picture is on a wall in Cooperstown, NY.The post-game interviews of Urrutia were among the most awkward I have ever seen. Clearly this really fine young man is sensitive about his developing English skills. But like everything else in his life, it may be a bit delayed in arriving, but he will work on it and a day will come when it gets to where it needs to be.The win was a good one for the Orioles, who needed it badly to keep pace with the Yankees. The O\xe2\x80\x99s simply need to keep winning, and the opportunity to do so is before them as they will finish this week with four straight against the Twins.As we wrote yesterday, the O\xe2\x80\x99s needed to forget the loss to the Mets, especially Jonathan Schoop. And he certainly did so by hitting a two-run homer and making some great defensive plays.Next: A game to quickly forget ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Surging Orioles Begin 4-Game Series With Fading Twins ...', ' (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 This has already been quite a homestand for the Baltimore Orioles. Four games against the fading Minnesota Twins could make it even better. Fresh off yet another walkoff victory, the Orioles seek their sixth win in seven games in the series opener Thursday night. Baltimore was eager to return home after losing five of nine on the West Coast and promptly continued its success at Camden Yards with a four-game sweep of Oakland. Two of those wins came on game-ending homers and Henry Urrutia delivered a third in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 5-4 victory over the New York Mets. It was the first career home run for Urrutia, recalled from Triple-A Norfolk on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the best moment of my career,\xe2\x80\x9d Urrutia said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I make good contact I was running for the base and in my mind I said, `I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe this.\'\xe2\x80\x9d Jonathan Schoop added a two-run shot and Adam Jones also went deep for the Orioles (62-57), winners of 10 of 13 at home since the All-Star break. They have homered at least once in all of those games, hitting 27 total. Jones and Chris Davis have been at the forefront of the offensive surge. Jones has batted .333 with six homers and 11 RBIs in his last 11 games, while Davis is hitting .342 with six home runs and 10 RBIs in 10 contests. Also making a contribution is newcomer Gerardo Parra, who has a .444 average with three homers and eight runs during a six-game hitting streak. Miguel Gonzalez (9-8, 4.42 ERA) seeks his first victory in five starts for Baltimore. Since winning at Tampa on July 25, the right-hander has gone 0-2 with a 6.64 ERA in four starts. The best outing of that span, however, came Saturday when he allowed three runs over seven innings against Oakland before leaving without a decision in a 4-3 victory. Gonzalez went 1-1 with a 3.09 ERA in two starts against the Twins last season. Minnesota was 10 games over .500 on July 17 but has since gone 9-21 to fall behind Baltimore, Texas and Tampa Bay in the battle for the second wild card. The start of a 10-game trip hasn\xe2\x80\x99t provided any answers for the Twins (59-61), who were swept in three by the New York Yankees to drop two games under .500 for the first time since April 30. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to move forward,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Paul Molitor told MLB\xe2\x80\x99s official website after Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-3 loss. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tough way to open a long road trip. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no room for self-pity. We have to dig a little deeper and then get ready for Baltimore.\xe2\x80\x9d Molitor\xe2\x80\x99s lineup will look a little different with center fielder Aaron Hicks out for an undetermined period after he strained his left hamstring running out a grounder Wednesday. The Twins will call up top prospect Byron Buxton from Triple-A Rochester to take Hicks\xe2\x80\x99 place. Buxton batted .189 in 11 games with Minnesota in June. Also missing for the Twins on Thursday will be All-Star closer Glen Perkins, who was given a cortisone shot for his ailing neck. The team is optimistic Perkins will be able to avoid the disabled list. This will be the third start for Tyler Duffey (1-1, 6.75), who rebounded from a rough major league debut with an excellent performance. Ten days after allowing six runs in two innings at Toronto, the right-hander took a no-hitter into the sixth against Cleveland on Saturday. He yielded only a one-out double in that inning, his final one in a 4-1 victory. The Twins swept a three-game home series from the Orioles July 6-8.  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com')]"

It would have better to have been postponed. Yes, that is a new record for runs given up this season.The picture attached to this article says it all.This game was so bad, so early, that I was starting to look forward to seeing Ryan Flaherty get a chance to play.

Though he had a 2.53 ERA in AA-AAA this year, his first two Big League starts had not gone well. But Duffey shut out the Orioles over the first seven innings, especially fooling them over and over with a sharp breaking ball.Though Duffey was very, very good, the Orioles were typically helpful in holding down the pitch count by swinging early and often in many at-bats. Of course, when a pitcher pounds the strike zone, good things generally happen if he has good stuff working on that evening. Duffey did.Just as the 18-2 drubbing that the O\xe2\x80\x99s laid on the A\xe2\x80\x99s a few games ago only gets to count as one win, this massacre only gets to count as one loss.As Adam Jones said after the game, \xe2\x80\x9cWe gotta just keep grinding.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Actually, I did not hear him say that, but I know for a fact that he did.

Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have gone 10-8 in the month of August. That record is buoyed by a 5-2 homestand so far in the middle of the month.But, there is another number that is just shocking. In the 10 wins, Caleb Joseph has caught nine of those wins, with Steve Clevenger catching the other one.Matt Wieters has caught in seven of the eight losses, the only game that the Orioles lost that Wieters did not catch was the Iwakuma no-hitter.What does this mean? You tell me.People, myself included, have felt like the Orioles are a better pitching team with Caleb Joseph behind the plate since he was first called up last year. Obviously, a lot of the time has been with Matt Wieters hurt. And, for whatever reason, the Orioles have a very, very good number when Joseph gets an RBI.I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying Matt Wieters is a bad player, far from it. But, I think the Orioles are spoiled by the abilities they have at catcher. In 2014, when the Orioles had their best record in years, who caught the majority of the season? Caleb Joseph.

And, he also can no longer catch, playing either first base or designated hitter.Matt will turn 30 next year in May. He is probably going to get paid over $10 million for the next four to five years this offseason. For a team in a situation like the Birds are in, it would be wise for them to not offer Wieters a contract.Caleb Joseph has shown he is more than capable as a hitter and a catcher. This year has revealed that when Caleb has a good amount of rest, like 2 or 3 days a week, he can be a very good catcher.Steve Clevenger has really worked on his catching as well, and his bat has never been an issue.Matt Wieters was supposed to be a once-every-decade player. He has been an All-Star, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a star for the Baltimore Orioles.It is clear that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 staff enjoys pitching to Caleb, as evidenced by the ERAs to each pitcher.

And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing; I\xe2\x80\x99m not necessarily blaming the Orioles in a sense. Look at last night\xe2\x80\x99s game, or heck even look at last year\xe2\x80\x99s ALCS against Kansas City. There are just some things for which you cannot prepare.\xc2\xa0Live Feed buck showalter10 things we've learned so far this MLB season FanSidedBaltimore Orioles execute a weird triple play on Boston Red Sox FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck Showalter The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Buck Showalter's Most Memorable Ejections The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles Clicking on All Cylinders The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: A hot start for Chris Davis could offset a trend of missed postseason appearances The Baltimore WireAnd yes folks, I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to how the O\xe2\x80\x99s were bled to death by bloop singles last night \xe2\x80\x93 as one example at least. But that was the story of last year\xe2\x80\x99s ALCS, and similar freak things have been the story of various losses this year. And not all of them are\xc2\xa0freak accidents per se. In general the conventional way of thinking tells us that solo home runs aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to beat you in the long run. But when you lose a game 3-1 which includes the opponent hitting two solo homers, they do turn into a problem.Similarly, bloops and dying quails into the outfield aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to beat you. But combine that with a lead off walk, and it might turn into a problem. The Orioles are very good \xe2\x80\x93 and I mean\xc2\xa0incredibly good\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 when it comes to the positioning of fielders. The infield shifts are one thing, but Showalter pays such close attention to detail that guys move a few steps here and there on every hitter, and sometimes every pitch.This of course is due to the fact that statistics are showing that this guy hits the ball to this area for the most part, and even that perhaps if he makes contact with two strikes it seems to always fly to this part of the field. But that leaves the Orioles suseptible to the unexpected. What do you do when a guy loops a broken bat single into the outfield, or a swinging bunt down the third base line when the infield is back? That kind of throws the numbers into file 13, if you know what I mean.All we can say is that in any sport (as in any facet of life perhaps) we should expect the unexpected. And by that I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the O\xe2\x80\x99s shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t defend to the statistics and so forth. They absolutely should. However what can be done is to limit what can be limited. If not for the lead off walk in the eighth inning last night, Minnesota might score only one run \xe2\x80\x93 maybe none at all.Furthermore, perhaps if in the backs of the minds of the players (and coaches) they\xe2\x80\x99re thinking that something strange could possibly happen, they might be a bit more prepared for it. Believe me folks, I\xe2\x80\x99m a pretty conventional guy myself. I thus always say that if you want to \xe2\x80\x9cdefeat me\xe2\x80\x9d all you have to do is do something totally unexpected. (If you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the term\xc2\xa0think outside the box\xe2\x80\xa6well, I am \xe2\x80\x9cthe box.\xe2\x80\x9d) Perhaps if he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking that a swinging bunt could possibly be coming down the line, Machado might be a step quicker in fielding it.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerThat all might be a bit of a stretch, because players are pretty nimble on their feet as it is.

He bounced back from a rough outing against Seattle on Aug. 11 \xe2\x80\x93 his first start after skipping his turn in the rotation because of a sore left ankle \xe2\x80\x93 and allowed a pair of solo homers through seven innings of Monday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-2 win over Oakland. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like right now as long as our starters are giving the team a chance to win and get deep into the game, set up the bullpen how it needs to be set up, I think we will be ready,\xe2\x80\x9d Tillman said after his last outing. The right-hander, though, is 0-3 with a 5.06 ERA in five career starts against the Twins and has lasted a combined 9 1-3 innings over the last three. He\xe2\x80\x99ll try to prevent Minnesota from winning three straight for the first time since a four-game run July 10-17. Kurt Suzuki\xe2\x80\x99s two-run single put the Twins ahead for good Friday, and he\xe2\x80\x99s driven in seven while batting .429 during a five-game hitting streak. He\xe2\x80\x99s 8 for 17 in four games against the Orioles, who have dropped all five meetings this season. The Twins (61-61) are 1 1/2 games behind the Orioles and Rangers in the wild-card race. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a big victory because we\xe2\x80\x99re playing a team that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good and they\xe2\x80\x99re ahead of us right now, and we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get in that wild card,\xe2\x80\x9d outfielder Torii Hunter said. The Twins look to keep rolling behind Kyle Gibson (8-9, 3.99), who has continued to struggle since the All-Star break. Gibson had a 2.85 ERA while allowing at least five earned runs twice through his first 18 starts, including an 8-3 win over Baltimore on July 7 when he struck out seven in six innings. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone 0-3 with a 7.91 ERA in his last six, though. The right-hander allowed at least six runs for the fourth time in that stretch in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 8-7, 10-inning loss to the New York Yankees.

Hardy, Minnesota took the lead for the first time in the seventh.Tillman issued a one-out walk to Eddie Rosario, who advanced to third on a hit-and-run single by Torii Hunter. Kurt Suzuki followed with a squeeze bunt down the first-base line that left Tillman no choice but to throw to first as Rosario crossed the plate.Brad Brach entered and walked Eduardo Escobar intentionally before Buxton lined a single to left. Buxton, the second overall pick in the 2012 draft, came in hitting .208 (10 for 48) over 13 games in his first major league season.In this game, the rookie laid down a sacrifice bunt in the sixth to help the Twins draw even, then delivered the decisive hit in the seventh.""It was nice to see him get his first RBI in a big situation,"" said Minnesota manager Paul Molitor, who turned 59 on Saturday.After spending much of the season with Class AAA Rochester, Buxton was delighted to contribute to the big league club.""When all the hard work you put in in the cage results in a base hit to win the game, that\'s all you can ask for,"" he said.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles lost their third straight game on Saturday evening, and the second in a row by one run after leading late in the game.The Orioles have also lost all six of their games against the Minnesota Twins this year, which is terrible when you consider how close the Twins and Orioles are in the standings.It isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to figure out why. The Orioles continue to not get enough depth from their starting pitching, and the bullpen is starting to show cracks. The team doesn\xe2\x80\x99t score a lot of runs if they aren\xe2\x80\x99t hitting home runs, and as the days of summer fade, it will be harder to hit homers without the heat. Yes, the warmer it is, the more homers, it is meteorologically proven.The Twins, on the other hand, manufacture runs like maybe no other team in baseball. They ended up scoring the winning run Sunday night on a safety squeeze by their catcher, Kurt Suzuki.\xc2\xa0Can you imagine Matt Wieters laying down a successful bunt?

J.J. Hardy was able to hit a sacrifice fly to score one run, but that was all the O\xe2\x80\x99s got.Is there hope? To be honest, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the Orioles can change their offensive scheme. They have been a home run hitting team since 2012, no changes there. They keep saying they want to improve their on-base percentage, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened.The pitching is what it is at this point. The bullpen is showing signs of wear and tear after a season where they have had to pitch so often. That is despite Jason Garcia pitching very well recently, and Brian Matusz as well.This looks a lot like 2013. The Orioles are going to hang around, and continue to put themselves in the Wild Card conversation, but in the end, this team may not have it.It looked like after the Mariners no-hitter, the season might be slowly coming to a close. Then the Orioles swept the Athletics in a four-game series, and all of a sudden were right back in the Wild Card hunt.Now, they have lost three in a row. And with a series with the AL-leading Royals on tap to start next week, the team is going to need to regroup. By next week, we will be about to turn the calendar to September, and the Orioles are running out of time.Next: J.J.

I say that in the sense that I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of a thinker and a schemer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t live very often in the moment, and instead I live in the future \xe2\x80\x93 my thoughts now are on tomorrow and the next day. Yesterday my thoughts were on today. But did that mentality cost the Orioles a game this afternoon?Keving Gausman was as strong as strong can be once again this afternoon. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7 IP, 3 H, 2 R, 0 BB, 6 K. However Gausman found himself down early \xe2\x80\x93 thanks again in part to a ball that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hit hard. Joe Mauer lined a very soft blooper into left field with two outs. He was followed by Miguel Sano, who smacked a two-run homer. That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much how this series has gone from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint; it seems that the moniker for Minnesota has been\xc2\xa0the softer the hit the more damage it does.\xc2\xa0Live Feed buck showaterBut Gausman settled down, and did more than his share to keep the Orioles in a spot to win the game. The Birds finally broke through in the last of the third with an RBI-single by Jonathan Schoop, which cut the lead to 2-1. After that initial flurry in the first, Minnesota appeared in no position to threaten; that\xe2\x80\x99s due in large part to Gausman. Schoop came through again two innings later with a two-RBI single in the fifth, which gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 3-2 lead.And that lead stood up for most of the afternoon. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day redeemed himself after Friday night by retiring Minnesota 1-2-3, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s even tried to get something going in the last of the eighth by pinch-hitting Matt Wieters for Ryan Flaherty. Wieters recorded an out to end the inning, and was replaced in the order by J.J. Hardy (who also took Ryan Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s spot in the field at shortstop). Keep in mind, Flaherty was in the game because Hardy was resting a sore groin.These things start innocently enough \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s always the case. Brian Dozier led off the inning with a grounder to Machado at third. Machado\xe2\x80\x99s throw to first was a bit off, and Chris Davis dropped the pick. It was charged an error on Machado, however it\xe2\x80\x99s also a play Davis should have made. And when you\xe2\x80\x99re a team like Minnesota who seemingly puts things together one step at a time and bleeds people to death, that\xe2\x80\x99s all you need.Dozier went to second on a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice, and Miguel Sano proceeded to strike out to record the second out. (Sano and manager Paul Molitor were also ejected for arguing the third strike).\xc2\xa0Trevor Plouffe then sent a seeing-eye single through the left side of the infield, which allowed Dozier to score. Yet again, Minnesota had found a way to get tho the Orioles without hitting the ball very hard \xe2\x80\x93 or really doing much of anything.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Whereas the Orioles are hitting the ball hard and recording outs, Minnesota is barely touching the ball and they\xe2\x80\x99re falling for base hits. If you\xe2\x80\x99re the O\xe2\x80\x99s, that has to be incredibly frustrating. Furthermore it\xe2\x80\x99s also overly simplistic in that you\xe2\x80\x99re basically sitting back and waiting for the other guy to beat himself. And sure enough\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in every game the teams have played this year. However this time that mistake came from a rare source: Buck Showalter. It\xe2\x80\x99s unfair in a way to second guess after a loss where his decision(s) didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out. He is the reining AL Manager of the Year, after all. He\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten more baseball than I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever know. But work with me here, and maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll see my point.Courtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsBefore Adam Jones struck out to end the inning, the Birds had two runners on with two gone in the last of the 11th. Showalter sent Jimmy Paredes out to pinch run for J.J. Hardy, who is now headed to the DL with a groin injury. In the top of the 12th, the Birds shifted Manny Machado over to his old position at shortstop, and inserted Paredes at third. Machado was thought to be a prized shortstop, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played the position since 2012 in the minors. As for Paredes, well\xe2\x80\xa6he has a decent bat.With one down Machado committed a fielding error at short on a ball that took a bad hop and allowed Eduardo Escobar to get to second base. With two down Paredes committed an error of his own, which allowed Escobar to score. And that was your ballgame \xe2\x80\x93 Minnesota defeating the Orioles 4-3. While Machado was originally a shortstop, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played there in some time; and Paredes isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good fielder overall.So the point here is that the Orioles re-shuffled their infield due to offensive changes, and it backfired. When guys are playing at spots where they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be, mistakes like that will happen. Any game is a team effort, however it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible that Buck Showalter over-managed or even out-thought himself in this game. And that might have even started by pinch-hitting Matt Wieters, which forced Hardy into the lineup.It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to put too much blame on Showalter in that sense, given the fact that his moves in games have worked out much more often than not. And having said that fans also need to realize that Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s human just like the rest of us. Mistakes happen \xe2\x80\x93 and hindsight is always 20/20. And again, I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of an over-thinker myself so I can\xe2\x80\x99t totally fault him. If he did over-manage in this game or this situation, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt he made the wrong decision for the right reason.The Orioles will now head to Kansas City, for a four-game rematch of the 2014 ALCS. Ubaldo Jimenez heads to the mound tomorrow night in game one. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Kris Medlen of Kansas City.

Pearce is not putting up the numbers similar to last season, but the utility player was heating up before heading to the disabled list. He batted .293 in June and .292 in July, but has had just five plate appearances since the All-Star break.J.J. Hardy has really been struggling and the Orioles had to be concerned about his play. He is batting .157 in August and has become a liability in the Orioles lineup. It\xe2\x80\x99s sad to say this, but Hardy is no longer an every day player. He has become a defensive specialist at this point of his career because of his offensive woes. The move to the DL is probably merited, but the Orioles couldn\xe2\x80\x99t risk to have him on the roster right now until he gets better at the plate.Nolan Reimold\xe2\x80\x98s departure comes as no surprise as Pearce makes his return. Reimold has not impressed since being called up in June and is batting .185 in the month of August. The play of Henry Urrutia, and the ability of Chris Davis and Pearce to play the outfield as well made Reimold expendable.

The ball was moving, and he had given up just one run on six hits. But with two outs and a runner on third base, the floodgates totally blew open. Mike Moustakas drove a ball out of the park to tie the game, and the rout was on.Suddenly the Orioles were on the run. Balls were flying between outfielders and throws were going in every direction \xe2\x80\x94 wildly across the infield, a relay over the fielder\xe2\x80\x99s head, a ball thrown to the wrong base allowing an extra runner into scoring position. It looked like the Australian Little League team did earlier in the day.Jimenez was allowed to stay in the game a batter or two too long \xe2\x80\xa6 not that it would have made a difference. Brad Brach immediately allowed two base hits before getting the final out. And the Orioles never did get another runner on base for the rest of the game. So it was a total team effort in losing.In fact, the Royals set down the final 16 Orioles to come to the plate. There really weren\xe2\x80\x99t any balls hit terribly hard either. About the only offense came from Adam Jones on a two-run homer in the first inning and Steve Clevenger on a deep double \xe2\x80\x94 before getting himself erased on a baserunning blunder.Orioles hitters proved again that there is never a pitch that they don\xe2\x80\x99t like to swing at. They registered not even a single walk, had only a total of 99 pitches thrown to them in nine innings, and only had two runners in scoring position on a mere five hits.The Orioles are #13 in the American League in bases on balls. They are #3 in hitting into ground ball double plays. And they rank dead last in total plate appearances; they simply get themselves out too quickly and do not let pitchers tire out and become hittable in clutch situations.None of these criticisms are new. And we will have much more to say about the 2015 Birds.

The Orioles only have a couple of the pieces of the puzzle.Looking statistically at the Royals and where they stand in the American League in varied categories, they dominate in few ways. But the total package when put together makes them the cream of the crop this year.They are dead last in the league in home runs with 99 (whereas the O\xe2\x80\x99s have 162). Some of that is the ballpark in which they play. However, they are fifth in doubles (223) and second with triples (34).\xc2\xa0 The Orioles rank 14th and 9th respectively. And the Royals hit 15 points higher than the O\xe2\x80\x99s in total average. Put this all together and the Orioles are only three-thousands higher in total OPS \xe2\x80\x93 fifth in the AL, versus sixth for KC.But KC is the better-fit team to win close games by their style of offense. And this is the need in the modern game of baseball with lower scoring and strong bullpens. The Orioles are now 17-23 in one-run games, whereas the Royals are 21-11, and 8-2 in extra-inning contests.Here is a huge statistical difference between the two clubs: The Orioles have struck out a total of 1016 times, as compared to only 711 for the Royals \xe2\x80\x94 the best in the league by far. Yet at the same time, KC has the fewest number of bases on balls in the A.L.\xc2\xa0 So they work counts and put balls into play with a decent on base percentage.And the Royals have speed. They are second in stolen bases with 83, whereas the O\xe2\x80\x99s are last with only 34. This speed especially helps them in the outfield. And Kansas City is very athletic, being more than guys who can simply hit and throw from a standing position.In 2014, the Royals demonstrated the model of having a shut-down bullpen as a prescription for success. And they are the best in 2015. In this regard, the Orioles have a similar strength, along with similar strengths as defensive teams. \xc2\xa0Starting pitching is everything? The Royals\xe2\x80\x99 starters have the fewest innings pitched in the A.L.Actually, the starting pitching is only marginally better for the Royals \xe2\x80\x93 who are 11th in the American League in ERA for starters, whereas the Orioles are 13th.\xc2\xa0 And the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 starters have thrown the least number of innings by starting pitchers in the entire A.L.\xc2\xa0 So much for the theory that starting pitching is everything.But again, the bullpen of the Royals is the best with a 2.34 ERA and 44 saves. The Orioles rank third at 2.86. Only Tampa Bay has more bullpen innings pitched than KC (by two innings)\xe2\x80\xa6 so again, the theory of an overused bullpen does not hold true for the best record in the league.All in all, the stats show the Royals to be a better than average team for sure, but not a dominant team, other than the bullpen and team speed. But putting it all together, the combined talents comprise a team that can fight and win close games.

He added another three superlative plays defensively along with two hits.

But the common theme of the last 11 games (2-9) was evident again: poor run support and high strikeout numbers. The Orioles managed only three hits while striking out 12 times.It is no secret that the Baltimore Orioles are a free-swinging team. It has been talked about a great deal. Buck Showalter has largely avoided addressing this issue with the team, often speaking to the media that he would not put much emphasis upon more plate discipline in fears that such would take away from an aggressive approach.I understand this in raw form, but like anything there is a time where too much of something becomes a net negative. And that is the situation now with the Orioles.In my view, Rick Dempsey is a very good baseball analyst; and I frankly think he would make a great manager. On the MASN pre-game show, he spoke to this issue and of the way that opposing scouts have seen this wild swinging at balls outside the strike zone. And this is especially true on breaking pitches.

The Rangers won 6-0. Mandatory Credit: Jim Cowsert-USA TODAY SportsThe post-game story for the Baltimore Orioles over the past two weeks (with one notable five-homer game) could be pretty much written before the first pitch is thrown. The constituent elements are all pretty much the same: an anemic offence that scores three runs or less, a mediocre pitching start that would at least keep the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the game if only they could score some runs, the few runners on base are stranded, and the bullpen looks like it is tired and barely hanging on at the end of a long season. Maybe you could throw in a dose of bad luck bounces and silly infield hits and bloops that put the opposition runners on base over and over.Every one of these issues has been written about on this blog in some fashion over this period of time, especially the dormant offence characterized by obscene strikeout numbers \xe2\x80\x94 add 11 more from Sunday in the 3-0 shutout by the Rangers on three hits at the hands of Derek Holland.Holland was very good, as have been many of the pitchers the O\xe2\x80\x99s have seen recently. So is it a matter of the pitching being very good, or is it that the hitting is simply bad?\xc2\xa0 It is both. And I am convinced that the pitching is excellent against the Birds because the O\xe2\x80\x99s hitters have been well-scouted and simply do not make adjustments. This is evident by the hitting streaks that turn into extended slumps, and it is also seen when new players join the team and hit well \xe2\x80\x94 for a while \xe2\x80\x94 until their weaknesses can be seen and attacked.

They see it and Scott (Coolbaugh) sees it. I see it, all the coaches. We\xe2\x80\x99re all a part of it. You guys see it, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious. We just need to correct it. Try to play within our skill set.\xe2\x80\x9dBut here is the problem: if good pitching stops the good hitting of the Orioles, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s cannot figure out how to beat strong pitchers, they cannot ultimately win championships, let alone make it to the playoffs.The Orioles are now 63-67.\xc2\xa0 I cannot believe this. They have already now, even before the end of August, lost more games than they did in the entire 2014 season (66 losses).\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore47m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d agoThere are 32 games remaining. To have a chance at the final wildcard spot, a team will likely need to win 87 games. This means that the Baltimore Orioles will need to win 24 of their final 32 games. That is asking quite a lot.But as I said yesterday, a comeback now would make for a great story and lots to write about. But if the O\xe2\x80\x99s continue to lose, writing about where to go from here will have lots of material as well. So I\xe2\x80\x99m in a win-win situation \xe2\x80\xa6 just wish I could give that to the Orioles.Next: The O's strikeout problem seen statistically\xc2\xa0 "", 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"
09/01/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Runs Scored, Runs Allowed Problems', ""Aug 31, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Tampa Bay Rays second baseman Logan Forsythe (11) scores before Baltimore Orioles catcher Caleb Joseph (36) can apply the tag during the second inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe inability of the Baltimore Orioles to score runs reminds me of a wisecrack my high school golf coach would make when I left a putt too short of the hole. He would say, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you realize it is true that 95% of all putts short of the hole don\xe2\x80\x99t go in?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Of course it is 100%, just as 100% of baseball games are losses when no runs are scored.But the problem is also that a startling number of baseball games are losses when few runs are tallied. Repeatedly over recent years it has been noted that when the Baltimore Orioles score four or more runs in a game, they win a high percentage of those contests. The trouble with the O\xe2\x80\x99s has been scoring those runs this year.For reference, let\xe2\x80\x99s take the numbers over the past two years, looking at the records and winning percentages relative to runs scored (remembering that the 2014 numbers represent 162 games, whereas the 2015 stats are only through the current number of 131 games) \xe2\x80\xa6Runs scored20142014%20152015%00-11.0000-9.0001 or less2-22.0831-22.0432 or less10-40.2004-38.0953 or less21-51.2969-52.1434 or more75-15.83354-14.794\xc2\xa0Looking at these numbers, it may be concluded (with a lot of truth) that the pitching has actually been worse in 2015. Hey, there is plenty of blame to go around!\xc2\xa0 But consider the next chart that shows what percentage of games played have had the number of runs scored in each category, and this demonstrates how much more poorly the Orioles are in terms of putting runs across the plate \xe2\x80\xa6Runs scored% in \xe2\x80\x9814% in \xe2\x80\x981506.8%6.9%1 or less14.8%17.6%2 or less30.9%32.1%3 or less43.8%46.6%4 or more55.6%51.9%\xc2\xa0Though the Orioles have shown an ability to get runners on base in the ninth inning and even score some runs (rather than just rolling over dead), they have rather terrible numbers when coming from behind. When trailing as they begin the eighth inning this year, the Orioles are only 1-58 in such scenarios; and they are a perfect 0-60 when going into the ninth inning behind.

The 2012 team won nine games in which they trailed when entering the eighth inning, and even four when behind as the ninth inning began.One of this blog\xe2\x80\x99s readers pondered if this year\xe2\x80\x99s current meltdown was on track to set any sort of record, year to year. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the worst turnaround is for MLB, but looking back at Orioles history (not counting years that were strike-shortened), the worst was from the 1966 World Series Championship team to 1967 \xe2\x80\x94 a 22-game difference.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are now 63-68, and if they go 11-20 or worse over the final 31 games, that would set a new meltdown record.Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this a cheerful post?Next: O's Need to win at least 75% of remaining games "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('No One Playing Worse than the Baltimore Orioles', '\xc2\xa0Aug 31, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles right fielder Chris Davis (19) leaps and misses a double hit by Tampa Bay Rays second baseman Logan Forsythe (not pictured) in the fifth inning a at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.I turned on Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s game as I got done running, only to watch Gerardo Parra strike out with the bases loaded.I sadly shook my head and prepared to watch the rest of the game, despite the Orioles losing 3-0. But then, Wei-Yin Chen put runners on the corners and a double play scored a fourth run, and then a solo HR by Evan Longoria and my thoughts of watching the O\xe2\x80\x99s vanished. They ultimately lost to the Rays, 6-3.I just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Sure, the Orioles are playing in a tough stretch right now. Sure, they are playing teams that are all league leaders or battling for a playoff start.BUT SO ARE THE ORIOLES. Even though their season is done for all intents and purposes, the standings say otherwise.Adam Jones went on a bit of a rant Sunday about how the team isn\xe2\x80\x99t giving up and anyone who thinks they aren\xe2\x80\x99t playing hard should be slapped.

Most of those games were as a designated hitter. If you annualized those numbers, he would have 16 home runs, 48 doubles, and 128 RBIs.I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason to not include Clevenger significantly in plans for 2016. He can be a back-up catcher and first baseman, while also being a primary designated hitter against right-handed pitching. I for one am ready to see the Orioles move on from Matt Wieters and use those dollars for other needs.

So good, in fact, that it only seemed fair to initiate this discussion: Could Cal Ripken manage the Baltimore Orioles in 2016?Sure he COULD. But the O\xe2\x80\x99s would never part ways with Buck Showalter, one of the best in the biz, just because some hometown hero decides he wants job.I don\xe2\x80\x99t think even the most feeble-minded of Orioles fans would advocate that.

But regardless of what Duquette does or does not do, Buck Showalter could make a heck of a front office guy.It would be easy to spend 1,000 words demonstrating the qualifications of Coach Buck, but I think it can\xc2\xa0best be simplified by saying this: He knows everything about baseball. Everything.Now back to Cal. Cal has recently been in the news with rumors surrounding the Washington Nationals. With the Nats failing to meet their lofty 2015 expectations, there have been talks about Cal Ripken replacing current manager, Matt Williams \xe2\x80\x94 last year\xe2\x80\x99s NL Manager of the Year.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles were right in the middle of the American League\xc2\xa0playoff race until plummeting into an inexplicable nosedive that negated everything they accomplished over the first 4 1/2 months of the season.Baltimore was 62-57 and trailed the Los Angeles Angels by a half-game for the second wild-card spot on Aug. 19. Since then, the defending AL East champions have dropped 12 of 14 to fall behind five teams in the hunt for\xc2\xa0the league\'s final playoff spot.""You go through stretches like that in baseball,"" center fielder Adam Jones said. ""It\'s just not good to get into them in August leading into September.""The last time the Orioles played this poorly was in 2011, when they were closing out a run of 14 consecutive losing seasons.Manager Buck Showalter subsequently lifted the franchise out of that dark era and brought about a baseball revival in Baltimore. After reaching the AL Championship Series in 2014, the Orioles appeared headed for their third postseason appearance in four years before this unfathomable skid.There have been close losses, routs, blown leads and embarrassingly early insurmountable deficits.""It\'s tough when the pitching and offense don\'t show up at the same time,"" catcher Matt Wieters said. ""Some of those games we pitched pretty well and just didn\'t score any runs. And then the games we did put some runs across, we weren\'t able to hold the other team.""The downturn started with a 15-2 home loss to the Minnesota Twins. Three consecutive\xc2\xa0one-run losses to the Twins followed, launching the Orioles into a free-fall that increased their deficit in the division from five games to 12.In most cases, the blame lies on an offense that has suddenly gone dormant. The Orioles are 9-53 when scoring fewer than four runs; not surprisingly, they tallied three runs or fewer in each of those 12 losses. They also struck out 135 times over the 14-game stretch.In an 11-2 loss to Tampa Bay on Tuesday, the Rays scored four runs in both the fourth and fifth innings. Baltimore\'s only salvo was a meaningless homer by Chris Davis in the ninth.In pressing to win, the Orioles achieved the opposite result.""There\'s a difference between losing ballgames and beating yourself,"" Davis said. ""There have been times when we\'ve really beat ourselves, making mistakes we don\'t normally make.""Although there have been four one-run defeats during this frustrating slide, the Orioles have been outscored 84-42.""How do you get of it? That\'s the beauty of this game,"" Jones said. ""The way you do it is you collectively come together and go out there and beat the crap out of somebody else instead of getting your tails handed to you.""Davis homered in the 11th inning Wednesday night to give the Orioles to a 7-6 win against the Rays, but there\'s no telling if that stopped the slide or merely interrupted it.The Orioles insist they won\'t quit on a season that had so much promise just two weeks ago.""I haven\'t seen anybody giving in or the lack of effort. That\'s important,"" right-hander Chris Tillman said. ""It is a test. It really is. You\'ve got to get through it and get back to playing the baseball we know we can. We know what we\'re capable of. We\'ve got to get back to it.""To do so, the Orioles must grind through a nine-game stretch against three of the best teams in the AL. Following an off-day Thursday, Baltimore goes to Toronto and Yankee Stadium before hosting the Kansas City Royals.""We feel like we\'re still in this,"" Wieters insisted. ""If we can get hot and make a run, all you\'ve got to do is get in the playoffs and it\'s a shot in the dark to win it all.""CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

But the good news is that as of last night, the bats overall woke up and they did so with Davis still being on the Birds in 2015.The game got off to an inausicious start, as\xc2\xa0Kevin Gausman\xc2\xa0struggled.

Later in the inning Longoria\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer ran the score to 3-0, and a Loney RBI-single made it 4-0.

Later in the inning Davis came to the plate with the bases empty, and suddenly the game was tied \xe2\x80\x93 after his solo homer. Unfortunately for the Birds however, Tampa would take the lead back in the sixth on a Sizemore RBI-double, and then in the ninth a Longoria homer would run the score to 6-4.That sent some folks to the exits at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Certainly this team wasn\xe2\x80\x99t capable of coming back at this point, right? I might understand why people might feel that way given how things had gone lately. But also keep in mind that the final story of the 2015 season isn\xe2\x80\x99t written until at the very least September is over.Wieters led the inning off with a walk, which brought\xc2\xa0Jonathan Schoop\xc2\xa0to the plate. On a 1-1 count, he hit a \xe2\x80\x9cno-doubter\xe2\x80\x9d deep into the night which tied the game. It was so sudden and so unexpected if you had followed the team for the past few weeks \xe2\x80\x93 yet so typical if you were a longtime O\xe2\x80\x99s fan. Whereas Tampa was already getting ready to get on the bus to the airport with a three-game sweep in their back pockets, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had other ideas.Through an inning-and-a-half of extras, nobody scored. And from the Birds\xe2\x80\x99Courtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsperspective that was a good thing. Home team bats last, right?

This is a team that\xe2\x80\x99s given the Orioles nightmares dating back a few seasons, however the true colors of this night were orange and black. Almost as soon as the game was tied and Toronto was feeling like they had restored order to their bizarro-universe, the Birds took control back.With Adam Jones\xc2\xa0already on base in the top of the sixth, Davis officially launched his 40th homer which gave the Birds the lead for good at 4-2. The O\xe2\x80\x99s would add to that lead later in the inning on a Wieters solo shot, which gave the Orioles a 5-2 lead. Machado added a sac fly-RBI, and Parra a two-run double in the eighth. To top things off, Jones would close the scoring in the game with a two-run homer of his own in the last of the eigth, handing the Orioles a 10-2 victory.This victory barely put a dent in the number of games the Orioles are back in both the division and the wild card races. However until you\xe2\x80\x99re mathematically eliminated, you absolutely have to operate with getting to the post season in mind. However this game puts not only Toronto, but also the entire league on notice that the Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t quite done yet.

He is 9-for-30 with a .344 OBP. And his defense is not nearly as bad as the reputation would suggest.I am certainly amazed at this string of disasters. It did not seem unreasonable to me to hope that one of the aforementioned players would step up and claim the job as a regular. But it never happened.So what is the future? Could it be Urrutia? That is not the expectation by many, but gosh, he certainly would have done better than the stats in the chart above.What if Gerardo Parra were to be signed in the offseason? Especially if Dariel Alvarez becomes the next right fielder? Well, Parra proves that there is a curse out there in that corner of Camden Yards, as he is hitting .125 in his six games at the #7 defensive position.As always, the answer will be tied to other spending the Orioles may do \xe2\x80\xa6 like trying to keep Chris Davis and addressing other holes and needs. But really, this is arguable the biggest hole.The offseason is going to be interesting for sure, and there should be plenty to write about and ponder.Next: Seven Orioles who had a good AugustMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore47m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Peter Llewellyn-USA TODAY SportsLike most baseball teams, the Baltimore Orioles are either carried (or dropped) by the performance of the third and fourth hitters in the lineup: Adam Jones and Chris Davis.On Friday evening against the mighty Toronto Blue Jays, the 3-4 hitters in the O\xe2\x80\x99s lineup carried the Birds to a 10-2 win with Davis hitting a pair of homers and Jones a two-run shot. Combined, they were 4-for-9 with five RBIs.However, in the 13 games recently in which the Orioles went 1-12, Chris Davis hit .170 with two home runs, while Adam Jones batted .224 with one homer and three RBIs.So just how much better do these two players hit well (and thereby largely carry the Orioles) in games that are won versus games that are lost? Here are the numbers for this year (prior to last night\xe2\x80\x99s game) for Jones and Davis, along with some of the other primary Orioles batters \xe2\x80\xa6PlayerBA/WinsBA/LossesDifferenceAdam Jones.325.227+ .098Chris Davis.328.184+ .144Manny Machado.308.275+ .033J.J.

Frank Robinson in the five years after he hit 49 in 1966 never tallied more than 32 in a season (1969). And Eddie Murray\xe2\x80\x99s highest season ever was 33. Boog Powell peaked at 39 and Cal Ripken at 34.For Jones in hitting his 25th, he becomes only the second Oriole to ever to have five consecutive seasons of 25+.\xc2\xa0 Cal Ripken had six such seasons consecutively from 1982-1987.Friday night\xe2\x80\x99s game was very entertaining beyond the fact that the Orioles beat the best offensive team in baseball and a pitcher who entered the game with a 13-2 record.Ubaldo Jimenez walked six batters but only yielded two runs in 5.2 innings. That is no way to live.Troy Tulowitzki demonstrated his great athleticism both with great defensive plays and a leap over Matt Wieters who attempted to catch him in a turn of first base due to an overthrow. I would have loved to have him as a hurdler on my high school track team.Speaking of my high school where I coached (Williamsport, MD), it was a school with a powerhouse history of volleyball state championships. Our girls were great at suckering in the opponents to crowd the net and all leap in an attempt to block a slam, only to have our setter dump the ball gently just over their heads. They told me the play is called a \xe2\x80\x9ccenter dump.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And that is what Ben Revere looked like he was doing on a Matt Wieters ball at the top of the wall in left-center field.

Jays beat Orioles 5 \xe2\x80\x93 1. Mandatory Credit: Peter Llewellyn-USA TODAY SportsThe mixed bag of results that have characterized the 2015 season for the Baltimore Orioles is seen rather fully in the first two games of this weekend series with the Toronto Blue Jays. It\xe2\x80\x99s a feast or famine sort of thing.On Friday night was the feast. The Orioles outslugged the Jays 10-2 by hitting four home runs and cranking out 13 base hits. The starting pitcher for the O\xe2\x80\x99s (Jimenez) was shaky for sure, but he held on enough to get the strong bullpen into the game and shut down the other team.On Saturday, the famine side showed up in a 5-1 loss. The starting pitching (Mike Wright) allowed the Jays to get an early lead, while a top-of-the-rotation starter for the opposition (David Price) was simply untouchable by Orioles bats. There was practically no margin for error, and the few opportunities to score went by without the critical hit to turn the game around.There is plenty with the Baltimore Orioles to complain about in terms of underperformance. But to be fair, why should we expect the O\xe2\x80\x99s to win a game like this?\xc2\xa0 Why should we think they actually are a playoffs caliber team?

By the way, the win was the 100th of his career, against 56 losses.All of this is to say, why would we think the Orioles should win a game like this, and why should we see them as contenders?\xc2\xa0 All four of these O\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers took to be on a trajectory for good and effective careers, they\xe2\x80\x99re just still all beginners.But here is another issue. You know you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get practically any chances to have a big inning off Price. So after breaking through and scoring a run in the seventh inning, there are two men on base and one out. This might be the last chance to change the complexion of the game and get back into it. Coming to the plate are those two offensive juggernauts Junior Lake and Paul Janish in the #8 and #9 spots! Time for pinch-hitters, right? Even if just for Janish.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore47m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d agoNope.One might have expected Matt Wieters, though we learned later that he was out for the game with a sore wrist. But why not Jimmy Paredes? Looking up his numbers, he is 1-for-2 against Price; but certainly he is a better hitter, at least for Janish. Ryan Flaherty (who is also a better hitter, even against the lefty Price) could go to shortstop. Or why not Steve Clevenger? Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s the backup catcher. But he could go to first, with Pearce moving to second, Schoop to third, and Manny to shortstop.There is just too much holding players back for contingencies that never (or rarely) develop, while the season swirls down the bowl.The fat lady is singing; the fork is out \xe2\x80\xa6 pick your metaphor.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsLet\xe2\x80\x99s face it, at this point there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much to talk about when it comes to the Baltimore Orioles major league team.They continue to lose games by the same formula. Starting pitching is ineffective and can\xe2\x80\x99t go deep in games. The offense depends way too much on the home run and can\xe2\x80\x99t put together runs otherwise.

If you go to the minor leagues, the team is seeing success.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 AAA affiliate, the Norfolk Tides, won the International League South over the Gwinnett Braves by one game.This is despite the constant roller coaster the AAA team endured, using so many different players. Eighteen people started a game for the Tides, and the team used 30 different pitchers.The team nearly used as many position players, using 26 of them, with only five players (Christian Walker, Michael Almanzar, Dariel Alvarez, Henry Urrutia, and Julio Borbon Jr.) playing more than 100 games.That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only level where the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 organization saw success. The Bowie Baysox also won their division, winning the Eastern League Western division by five games over the Altoona Curve.The Baysox were led by two very different starters. Terry Doyle, a minor league journeyman, went 12-1 with a 1.97 ERA. Joe Gunkel, acquired by the Orioles for Alejandro De Aza, started the most games for the Baysox, showing his ability as a potential future starter in the major leagues.Leading the Baysox offensively was a three-headed crew of Trey Mancini, Quincy Latimore and Mike Yastrzemski. Latimore led the team in hits, HR and 2B. Mancini led the team in average with an average of .359.The team\xe2\x80\x99s two single A teams did not make the playoffs, but both had seasons where they finished toward the top half of their divisions.Despite this minor league success, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 farm system is largely considered to be weak by national pundits. That is likely because some of the best players this year were journeymen, not top prospects.Latimore and Doyle will never be major league players. But both stepped up in a big way this year for the minor league Orioles.The question now is what moves this team makes to be successful for 2016, both at the major and minor league levels.Next: A single Bird beats The Birds ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Greg Bird\\u2019s Walk Aids Yankees, and His Homer Wins Game ...', '     Supported by    Baseball |                            Yankees 8, Orioles 6                                                             Greg Bird\xe2\x80\x99s Walk Aids Yankees, and His Homer Wins Game  By SETH BERKMANSEPT. 7, 2015    Continue reading the main story Share This Page  Continue reading the main story                if (             window.magnum             && window.magnum.getFlags().indexOf(\'headlineBalancer\') > 0             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.shouldRun()         ) {             window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize();         }         Photo       The rookie first baseman Greg Bird hitting a seventh-inning homer that drove in Carlos Beltran and Chris Young and put the Yankees ahead, 8-5.

The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Wei-Yin Chen threw Bird an inside pitch, and Bird, a 22-year-old rookie, winced as if he had been hit.The acting was underwhelming. After ruling that the ball had fouled off the bottom of Bird\xe2\x80\x99s bat, the plate umpire, Clint Fagan, called Bird back into the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box. Bird later said that he knew the pitch had nicked his bat but that he was scared and caught off guard.In the end, Bird coaxed out a free base by drawing a walk that set up John Ryan Murphy for a two-run homer. That blast put the Yankees on top of a seesaw battle, 5-4.In the seventh, after the Orioles had tied the game on a Manny Machado home run, Bird came through in more striking fashion, hitting a three-run shot over the right-field wall, and the Yankees held on for an 8-6 win at home.

09/10/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Score Four, Wins More for O\\u2019s', 'Sep 9, 2015; Bronx, NY, USA; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Steve Pearce (28) watches his game winning solo home run against the New York Yankees in the eighth inning at Yankee Stadium. The Orioles defeated the Yankees 5-3. Mandatory Credit: Andy Marlin-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles put together an all-around good game on Wednesday evening in New York by defeating the Yankees 5-3. Ubaldo Jimenez gave them their first quality start in 14 games, the offense tallied five runs, the defense was typically good, and the bullpen did the O\xe2\x80\x99Day / Britton shutdown thing in the 8th/9th to save the lead.After the Orioles scored their first three runs on two totally bonehead defensive plays by Stephen Drew, the go-ahead and game-winning run was a homer by Steve Pearce. The long fly was hit off Adam Warren in the 7th inning, though Pearce just missed getting enough of two other fly balls earlier off CC Sabathia.Much has been made over the past several years about the magic number of four or more runs scored being the key to winning games. I chaff at that and have written against this notion as overly simplistic, but honestly the statistics are difficult to argue against.Year< 4 Runs4+ RunsTotal201510-5457-1867-72201421-5175-1596-66201316-4659-3185-77201221-5272-1793-69\xc2\xa0Those are very impressive numbers for sure. But to be honest, probably every team has a broadly similar story. For example, the Kansas City Royals are 18-43 and 65-13 this year in the same categories (which does reflect their better overall pitching); and they were 20-59 / 69-14.Ubaldo Jimenez had good ball movement, which he usually does. We know that is not the problem. The home run he yielded was actually on a ball outside the strike zone and the other two runs scored on a poorly-hit ball. It is all about command, and on this night he struck out eight while walking none in his seven innings.

Teams tend to wait him out to see if he will lose control, multiply free passes, aim and groove a strike, and generally run up his pitch count and become vulnerable. When he pounds the strike zone, he is among the best; when he does not, he is among the worst.The Orioles are one game behind the Rays and one game ahead of the Red Sox\xe2\x80\xa6 not what we expected this year. Also not expected, and still a curiosity to me, is how this New York Yankees team is 16 games over .500.\xc2\xa0 There is simply nothing very special about it all beyond the bullpen, but they have found ways to win games while other have found ways to lose them.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore48m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Shoddy Fielding Sabotages C.

C. Sabathia. Two strikes on a batter, a pivotal moment in the game, and the Yankee Stadium crowd throwing its support behind him.But a night when Sabathia provided a heartening return from the disabled list ended much the same way the season has unfolded for him \xe2\x80\x94 with little to show.Instead of walking off the field triumphantly to end the fifth inning, Sabathia did so stewing over his final pitch, a 2-2 slider that plunked Chris Davis in the shoulder. Second baseman Stephen Drew followed with an error that allowed the tying runs to score and keep the Baltimore Orioles in the game long enough to beat the Yankees, 5-3, on Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s tiebreaking eighth-inning home run.The loss meant that the Yankees would be one and a half games behind the American League East-leading Toronto Blue Jays when the teams begin a four-game series on Thursday in the Bronx.

He dropped a made-to-order double-play ball in the first, and more critically dropped a throw from third baseman Chase Headley that would have allowed Warren to escape a bases-loaded jam he inherited from Sabathia and end the fifth inning.

After Adam Jones singled, Morales hit Davis in the back with a pitch. Davis slammed down his bat, breaking it in two, as Showalter sprinted out of the dugout.No one else emerged from either dugout during the potentially volatile situation, although Davis glared at Morales while taking his base.\xe2\x80\x9cWe hit a grand slam, another home run, a couple rockets,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just didn\xe2\x80\x99t look right, regardless of whether it was on purpose or not.\xe2\x80\x9dShowalter thought it was, and was ejected for arguing that point.Thus, he missed what happened next: Morales lasted one more batter before being replaced by Joba Chamberlain, who yielded Clevenger\xe2\x80\x99s slam. Clevenger entered the game earlier in the inning as a pinch hitter. .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; } .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; } .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; } .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; } p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  } p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYKansas City Kansas City at Baltimore OriolesRoyals manager Ned Yost insisted that Morales was not throwing at Davis.\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to react like that because it does hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d Yost said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that pitch wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on purpose.

Kansas City is now 63-3 when leading after seven.Lorenzo Cain hit two solo homers and Alex Rios also connected with the bases empty for the Royals, who have lost eight of 11.\xe2\x80\x9cYou go through stretches like this,\xe2\x80\x9d Cain said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t let it worry us.

Fellow rookie Dariel Alvarez hit his first big league homer for Baltimore.It was the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 first visit to Baltimore since last October, when they opened the AL Championship Series with two straight wins at Camden Yards and completed the four-game sweep at home.While first-place Kansas City appears poised for a return trip to the postseason, the defending AL East champion Orioles started play Friday trailing six teams for the league\xe2\x80\x99s final wild-card spot. Baltimore must win 13 of its last 22 games just to finish .500.The Royals\xe2\x80\x99 early 3-0 lead dwindled to 4-3 before Rios led off the seventh with a drive off Brad Brach \xe2\x80\x94 his first home run since July 17. Davis countered in the bottom half with a run-scoring single to increase his RBI total to 105.Salvador Perez restored the two-run cushion with an RBI single in the eighth, setting the stage for Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s grand comeback.TRAINER\xe2\x80\x99S ROOMRoyals: Reliever Wade Davis was unavailable because of shoulder stiffness.Orioles: Jones returned to the Baltimore lineup after missing two games with a sore right shoulder.

Just saw my name with the 6 next to it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a position I\xe2\x80\x99ve always played, so I was comfortable..\xe2\x80\x9dThe move represents the full range of Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s talent and the particulars of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 roster, but it is also telling about the state of infield play as the 2015 season reaches its final month. There\xe2\x80\x99s much talk about how the NBA is evolving to a positionless state, but the rapid influx of shifting is pulling baseball closer to that new reality as well, particularly on the infield.Or as his manager Buck Showalter put it, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s been playing shortstop most of the season.\xe2\x80\x9d .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; } .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; } .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; } .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; } p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  } p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYNightengale: Without a doubt, David Ortiz is a Hall of FamerWhat Showalter means is that the Orioles spend a great deal of time shifting. Accordingly, Machado found himself at what is traditionally the shortstop\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the field even while officially playing third base.\xe2\x80\x9cThe biggest difference is the amount of right-handed hitter shifts,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been shifts forever. And playing guys\xe2\x80\x99 strong pull. The biggest difference to me is on the right-handed hitters. And the reason is foot speed. The reason you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it years ago is you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t throw a guy out from back there.\xe2\x80\x9dFor Machado, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t a problem. The Orioles originally deployed Machado in right field, taking the second baseman\xe2\x80\x99s traditional role in shifting, when Machado got to the big leagues in 2012 and again in 2013. But the development of Jonathan Schoop, another infielder with a strong arm, allowed them to not only keep Machado on the shortstop side of the field for shifting, but to keep him getting reps at the position in case they wanted to move him back there at any point.During J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s recent disabled list stint, that\xe2\x80\x99s just what they did, with Machado earning his first five major league starts at the position.While the move runs counter to the traditional direction between the two spots\xe2\x80\x94shortstops have moved to third base, not the other way around - the consensus seems to be that it was Machado\xe2\x80\x99s move to third as a rookie that was far more challenging than his return to the natural position. One reason is Machado\xe2\x80\x99s range, which has never been in doubt, unlike many shortstops who are eased into another position (such as Jim Fregosi late in his career, for example).Machado\xe2\x80\x99s defensive value leads all third basemen in baseball for the duration of his career, and according to Fangraphs, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly close. But in Machado\xe2\x80\x99s case, the reason he isn\xe2\x80\x99t an everyday shortstop is the man occupying the position right now, reigning Gold Glover Hardy.\r Another man who knows what it means to move from his natural position to defer to a teammate, Alex Rodriguez, suggests Machado\xe2\x80\x99s move back to shortstop was the easier of the two relocations.\xe2\x80\x9cA third baseman going to shortstop, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a natural shortstop, it\xe2\x80\x99s always going to be easier,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodriguez told USA TODAY Sports . \xe2\x80\x9cA shortstop\xe2\x80\x99s like playing point guard. From your lens, you can see the whole scope of everything. From third base, you\xe2\x80\x99re limited. The angles are a lot more challenging. Just like left field is harder to play than center field, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a natural center fielder. So I think whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Manny or any good athlete, I think going back to your natural position is going to be easier.\xe2\x80\x9d .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; } .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; } .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; } .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; } p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  } p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } DETROIT FREE PRESSSource: Tigers to fire Brad Ausmus at season's endSo Machado had the reps, and he had the history. He also picks things up more quickly than most, which means that while he was mastering a new position in real time at the major league level barely out of his teens, he was paying close attention to the veteran working next to him.\xe2\x80\x9cYou look over, see where he\xe2\x80\x99s playing, it just sticks with you,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cI give the credit for how easily the move has come to me all to J.J. I try to do the same thing I see from him over there.\xe2\x80\x9dFor his part, Hardy wanted no credit for anything Machado had learned from him.\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say much. Manny\xe2\x80\x99s observant, he sees the way I do things,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hardy, a shortstop only since playing third base as a college freshman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen he has questions, he\xe2\x80\x99ll come to me and I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer them. I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s a Platinum Gold Glover, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a supreme talent, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to change anything he\xe2\x80\x99s doing.\xe2\x80\x9dOrioles infield coach Bobby Dickerson - a minor league veteran of second base, shortstop and third - altered Machado\xe2\x80\x99s routine pregame a bit - five to 10 groundballs at shortstop, making the double-play pivot and deep throw from the hole.\xe2\x80\x9c Even at the days he\xe2\x80\x99s at third,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dickerson, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause when he\xe2\x80\x99s in the shift, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have a long throw to make, and we want him to stay in touch with this.\xe2\x80\x9dThere\xe2\x80\x99s little reason to think the Orioles are keeping him ready for an imminent change at the position. Hardy has two years left on his contract after this one, and Showalter talked up Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make the players around him better and, unprompted, suggested he\xe2\x80\x99d finish strong at the plate.But Hardy is 33, and completing his worst offensive season, one in which he\xe2\x80\x99s played just 94 games. Machado turned 23 this summer. And his bat is significantly more valuable at shortstop, where American Leaguers are posting an OPS of .681, than at third base, where the collective AL OPS output is .741.But exactly how much does the designation shortstop and third base still mean? Still plenty, everyone agrees, but undeniably less.\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the biggest challenges with shifting is coverage of the bag on balls hit,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe spend a lot of time in spring training\xe2\x80\x94we take infield (practice) out of the shift. There\xe2\x80\x99s so many things you have to communicate before the pitch, but I think you get a lot of return for it, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why the batting averages have gone down.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0(Photo: Nick Wass, AP)Yet one thing Machado and Rodriguez stressed is that beyond the useful strategies that are still growing in scope and influence, the players themselves will largely dictate the action on the field.\xe2\x80\x9cI think a center fielder is always going to be the best athlete on the field, also the shortstop,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodriguez said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to change years from now. I think technology is going to continue to change the game. I think the sweet spot is somewhere in the middle, between technology and the great old-school baseball minds like Buck Showalter and Lou Piniella and Joe Girardi. And I think what won\xe2\x80\x99t change is the best athletes in the middle of the field.\xe2\x80\x9dSo Machado returned to third base against the Yankees. The shift placed him back at shortstop much of the night. According to Machado, he\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly happy at either spot. And the Orioles have every reason to feel the same way. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to prepare for a positionless future - \xe2\x80\x9cMight as well!\xe2\x80\x9d, Machado said when asked if that\xe2\x80\x99s the direction baseball is headed\xe2\x80\x94with Machado as a formidable option.\xe2\x80\x9cWe like guys who can catch the ground ball,\xe2\x80\x9d Dickerson said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd our guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t the most rangy infielders. But we trust them. We trust their clocks, and we trust their ability to make the plays. And that\xe2\x80\x99s wherever we put them. And obviously, we like to have the super talents also.\xe2\x80\x9dGALLERY: Top players under 25FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInBaseball's top players under 25\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.                                      3B Nolan Arenado, Rockies\xc2\xa0                                      Isaiah J.

And there can be no doubt that 9/11 rocked the very fabric of America \xe2\x80\x93 for those of us who lived through it. And I now have to find myself throwing that last bit in, because there are already kids in schools who are seeing 9/11 only through the lenses of history books as opposed to first-hand experience.For those who care, I was a junior in college at the time. I had a course from 9-10:15 AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays on the American Presidency. Ironically, that day we had talked about the special war powers of the President, and I clearly recall the professor saying that none of us in our lifetimes had ever seen them put to use. Little did we know what was going on and the havoc it would cause right as we were learning that.As I walked to my next course, I started to hear the news of what was happening. And when it hit me in full, I took a step back and kind of took in my surroundings. And I knew at that moment that for the rest of my life I\xe2\x80\x99d never forget being right there looking at academic buildings under green trees and blue skies when I heard the news.And all of you have your stories of where you were and so forth. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll all carry those with us forever. As we know, 9/11 shut down Major League Baseball for the better part of a week. The NFL also postphoned it\xe2\x80\x99s games that weekend. Outside of recovery efforts, mourning, and essential functions of life, time seemed to stop in America for a period of time.But that\xe2\x80\x99s par for the course in our country. As I said,\xc2\xa0some events rock the world. And thus we owe it to time itself to stand back and take note. There was a lot of uncertainty in those subsequent days and weeks. However one of the great marks of America is how we recover. Eventually the crowds returned to the ballparks, and the screams of\xc2\xa0play ball! were heard. Eventually the NFL returned, and life came back to as normal as it could in America.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

And make no mistake about the fact that the looks on the faces of the Kansas City platers was one of shock; they were supposed to bloop and bleed the O\xe2\x80\x99s to death \xe2\x80\x93 the script they were issued didn\xe2\x80\x99t read to the effect that the Orioles would bludgeon them with their power. And come the end of the game, it was obvious that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t really care for the\xc2\xa0new world order that the O\xe2\x80\x99s instituted last night.Mike Wright\xc2\xa0had his struggles last night, but gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s five tough innings. Wright\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 4 H, 4 R, 2 BB, 2 K. At first it appeared that Kansas City was going to get their way in that they\xe2\x80\x99d add a run here and a run there. They started out with a Cain homer in the first,\xc2\xa0a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice-RBI off the bat of Rios, and an Escobar RBI-double (both in the second) to take a 3-0 lead.\xc2\xa0Live Feed chris davisBaltimore Orioles execute a weird triple play on Boston Red Sox FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Buck Showalter's Most Memorable Ejections The Baltimore WireWATCH: Chris Davis goes into Bo Jackson mode on bat FanSidedDraftKings Late MLB Picks For April 14 Fantasy CPRBaltimore Orioles: A hot start for Chris Davis could offset a trend of missed postseason appearances The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: How long can one of the best infields in the league stay together? The Baltimore WireDariel Alvarez\xc2\xa0led off the third with a solo homer (the first of his career), and an inning later Joseph grounded into a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice-RBI. That cut the lead to 3-2, although Cain decided to run it to 4-2 with a sixth inning lead off homer of his own. Granted the Orioles put a run across in the last of the sixth when Joseph grounded into another FC-RBI, Rios ran the score to 5-3 with a solo homer in the seventh.The teams traded runs in the last of the seventh and top of the eighth, which was just fine with Kansas City given that they held a two-run lead at 6-4.\xc2\xa0But in grand fashion, the O\xe2\x80\x99s decided that they just weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to allow Kansas City to own the night. With one out in the last of the eighth,\xc2\xa0Nolan Reimold stepped to the plate. With one swing of the bat, he put Kansas City on notice to the effect that the Birds and their fans weren\xe2\x80\x99t really thrilled with their act \xe2\x80\x93 dating back to last year\xe2\x80\x99s ALCS. Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s grand slam gave the Orioles the lead at 8-6.That was a huge momentum swinger, and suddenly the Birds were in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat. But wait \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0there\xe2\x80\x99s more! The O\xe2\x80\x99s would also get a solo homer by Machado, and an RBI-double by Pearce to run the score to 10-6. The Birds then managed to load the bases again, and they were abruptly cleared by a second grand slam in the eighth \xe2\x80\x93 this one off the bat of\xc2\xa0Steve Clevenger.That was perhaps the type of inning that this team had needed for some time. It effectively ended the competitive part of the game given that it would take a miralce for Kansas City to replicate the grand manner in which the Orioles put up all of those runs. Unfortunately, part of what set up the second grand slam was an incident that probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to happen.\xc2\xa0More from Chris Davis7/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Davis sets up win in the twilight zone6/27 - Baltimore Orioles complete the sweep of Tampa6/14 - Will Chris Davis Continue His Impressive Home Run Streak?6/10 - Baltimore Orioles: Comeback kids led by Chris Davis6/1 - Baltimore Orioles: Fair is foul, foul is fairAdam Jones\xc2\xa0singled immediately after the Machado home run, and Kansas City pitcher Franklin Morales\xc2\xa0decided\xc2\xa0he had seen enough. Chris Davis came to the plate, and was plunked in the back. Davis angrily slammed down his bat and headed to first base. That reaction seemed to cause home plate umpire Mark Carlson to warn both benches \xe2\x80\x93 which set\xc2\xa0Buck Showalter off.Courtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsPerhaps justifiably so, Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s point of contention was that his team was being punished for being hit. In effect, the Orioles shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been warned in that scenario \xe2\x80\x93 only Kansas City. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a very valid point. Showalter proceeded to inform Carlson that Morales should have been ejected (without the warning) in that situation, a move that eventually got Showalter ejected. And if what happened a few moments later is any indication, I think Carlson might have actually been swayed by Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s point.With two on and two out in the ninth (and the Orioles leading 14-6),\xc2\xa0Mychal Givens\xc2\xa0drilled\xc2\xa0Kendrys Morales\xc2\xa0to load the bases \xe2\x80\x93 on the first pitch of the at-bat. Baseball is a game that has always operated witth a sense of \xe2\x80\x9cfrontier justice\xe2\x80\x9d in a sense; was that hit batsman intentional? I sure think it was. But the fact that Givens wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ejected is very telling. Mark Carlson had already issued warnings, and thus Givens should have probably been tossed. But I think Carlson understood and accepted this for what it was: an enforcement of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s unwritten codes.Some will point to the fact that Moustakas smacked a two-RBI single to run the score to 14-8 (the eventual final) as a reason that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hit batters. But make no mistake about the fact that the Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t happy with what happened. Showalter normally doesn\xe2\x80\x99t call out the other team, even in situations like that. However his comments after the game made his point very clear (quote courtesy of Roch Kubatko, MASNsports):You saw it. He got hit by a pitch intentionally. Chris has certainly had his share of that. It just happened in New York twice. You get to a point to where your nose is rubbed in it. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s harder to do what Chris did than what some other people might have done. It gets tough time and time again turning the other cheek, but our guys responded well to it.Needless to say, both of those HBP\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to happen. But the second one came as a result of the first. The series\xc2\xa0will continue this afternoon with\xc2\xa0Chris Tillman\xc2\xa0on the mound.

That translates to a full season total of 33. I am betting we are going to see a number like that if he is healthy for the full season of 2016.For this current year, Schoop is now hitting .291 \xe2\x80\xa6 and this is a totally different situation than what we saw at the end of last year where he simply ran out of steam in September. Of course, Schoop does need to be better about pitch selection and cut down on his strikeout total that now stands at 66.

And that does not account for the fact that they are 4.5 games behind the second wild card with three other teams ahead of them.Other things that could theoretically happen:\xc2\xa0 Donald Trump might become a humble man; Barack Obama may embrace his inner Republican; Jeb Bush might change his last name; and Hillary Clinton might find the lost emails from her private server.A Winning RecordPerhaps it is academic as to whether the final record is 82-80 versus 80-82, but I think it does matter and have significance. Others can, and will, argue the opposite point of view. But statistics hounds look back at such things as consecutive winning seasons, etc.\xc2\xa0 And I would think it is a matter of pride for the players and organization to avoid a losing record.Third Place in the American League EastAgain, for a team that was fresh off a 96-66 season wherein they walked to the A.L. East title with hopes of doing the same this year, it may beg the question of \xe2\x80\x9cwhat difference does it make at this point?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 After all, finishing third isn\xe2\x80\x99t even high enough to call yourself \xe2\x80\x9cthe first loser.\xe2\x80\x9d But as in item #2, it is a matter of pride to finish ahead of the Red Sox and Rays\xe2\x80\x94two teams that are admittedly not the best at all.Right now, the Orioles are two games ahead of the Rays and 2.5 ahead of the Red Sox. Stated another way, the Birds want to make sure that they don\xe2\x80\x99t go down in history as finishing last in the division in 2015.Yes, it is pitiful that we are having this discussion in mid-September.Personal Goals and AchievementsThere is interest in seeing various players achieve some personal goals and standing in the American League, even if they are fewer in number as compared to what we hoped to see this year.Chris Davis has a shot at being the leader in both home runs and RBIs. He is tied with Nelson Cruz with 42 homers and is second to Josh Donaldson with 107 runs batted in, though he trails by 13. Davis has already guaranteed that he will be the strikeout king, having 193\xe2\x80\x94which is 32 ahead of J.D. Martinez. He is, however, fifth in walks and fourth in extra base hits.Manny Machado is the other name most often seen on American League statistical leaderboards. He is actually #1 in an odd category on baseball-reference.com called \xe2\x80\x9cpower-speed number,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a factoring of stolen bases and home runs. He is also tied for top position in games played (a real tribute to his knees), and he is #2 in plate appearances, fourth in total bases, sixth in hits and runs scored, and seventh in total bases.

Manny needs just one more, Adam needs three.Just about the only Orioles pitcher on the leader lists is Zach Britton. With 33 saves, he is fourth in the League, though just three behind the leader. Chen is #9 in ERA among starters and sixth in fewest walks per nine innings, but he is also #2 in home runs allowed at 32\xe2\x80\x94only one behind the leader.Evaluating Veterans for 2016By this, I mean more than evaluating the pending free agents like Gerrardo Parra, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day or Steve Pearce. For example, should the Orioles work to retain Nolan Reimold?Beyond this, there is the matter of evaluating the condition of J.J. Hardy. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are going to need to get the bang for their buck over the next three years. I\xe2\x80\x99d shut him down and get him started on resting/rehabbing for 2016.\xc2\xa0 And what about Miguel Gonzalez; what role will he have in 2016? We could mention Caleb Joseph as well, though I think the jury has already answered on this one\xe2\x80\x94that he is a big asset for several years ahead.Evaluating Younger Players for 2016The end of the season always gives an opportunity for a look at some pending big league players, along with younger players that have contributed through much of the year. Things look good for the future for Mychal Givens and even Jason Garcia. Dariel Alvarez looks to be on the cusp as well.The Orioles may need to get several starts out of Tyler Wilson. And other relievers of interest are Oliver Drake and Jorge Rondon.So there is plenty to still find interesting for the true baseball fan, even apart from the largely shattered hopes of postseason play.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore48m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

09/20/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton Beaten \\u2014 It\\u2019s That Bad', 'Sep 20, 2015; St. Petersburg, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter (26) comes out to talk with relief pitcher Zach Britton (53) and teammates during the ninth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field. Tampa Bay Rays defeated the Baltimore Orioles 7-6. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsPerhaps the best performer on the Baltimore Orioles over this current season has been closer Zach Britton. And so, at a time when the O\xe2\x80\x99s simply cannot lose a game without it being pretty much fatal, the Tampa Bay Rays found a way to beat Britton\xe2\x80\x94coming back in the bottom of the ninth inning from a 6-5 deficit to record a 7-6 win.This is all very ironic, because Zach Britton is probably the very last person on the Orioles upon whom to lay blame for this disappointing 2015 campaign. So it really is \xe2\x80\x9cTHAT BAD\xe2\x80\x9d when he takes the loss\xe2\x80\x94in odd fashion, of course. After giving up a leadoff homer Brandon Guyer and one-out triple to Evan Longoria, Britton was a strike away from sending the game into extra innings. But, as with so many hits off Zach, it was an infield chopper that scored the death-blow run.In spite of the Orioles simply not coming from behind to win many close games this year (though they did do it in this series opener), they were 60-1 when having a lead going into the ninth inning.Looking back to another year of collapse, more of the blame for the 2013 demise could be laid upon the closer at that time\xe2\x80\x94Jim Johnson\xe2\x80\x94than any other single player.But I thought it would be interesting to lay out the stats of these two O\xe2\x80\x99s closers over the past three seasons where the Birds have become a competitive team \xe2\x80\xa6GamesIPSavesBSERAWHIPJohnson-127168.25132.491.019Johnson-137470.15092.941.280Britton-147176.13741.650.904Britton-156061.23442.041.020\xc2\xa0The loss was the first of the year for Britton, after having four wins. Britton is not the problem with the Orioles in 2015, even if he did leave a pitch up in the zone for the homer and did not throw a better pitch on the 0-2 chopper that won the game.Chris Davis had another fine game and hit his 43rd home run of the season\xe2\x80\x94a blast that gave the Orioles a lead at that time.The Orioles need to finish 8-5 over the final 13 games to gain a .500 season.

Mandatory Credit: Peter Llewellyn-USA TODAY SportsBefore the rainout in Washington on Monday night was officially announced, the O\xe2\x80\x99s MASN reporters were filling time with reflections on the 2015 season for the Baltimore Orioles. In talking about Chris Davis, they were discussing how Crush has put together a great season, saying that Crush put the team on his back and carried them. Is this really true?The reporters did immediately acknowledge that not enough of the rest of the team pulled their weight and helped Davis. And that certainly is true and REALLY needed to be said at that point.This will be far from the last piece we do on Chris Davis, reflecting both on this season, his time with the Orioles, and considering what chances there are of a continued future and at what cost.So let\xe2\x80\x99s look at some numbers a bit and ask if Davis can be said to be the offensive workhorse of the team. But first, here are some general summary statements about this 2015 campaign \xe2\x80\xa6Chris Davis has had a better season than probably most writers and fans expected. I would have been content with .235 and 35 home runs as at least decent, whereas Davis has a current .264 average with 43 home runs and 109 RBIs.The 2015 season was a great improvement over 2014\xe2\x80\x99s debacle. This is not saying much however, as 2014 was truly terrible. The only thing saving him from having more strikeouts than batting average (practically never done in the history of baseball, but see \xe2\x80\x9cReynolds, Mark\xe2\x80\x9d) was his 50-game suspension ending the season.The 2015 season is not as good as 2013. But again, that is quite a standard. It was one of the all-time great single seasons for a player, posting 53 homers, 138 RBIs and .286 average.The 2015 numbers look to be better than average for Davis in his career. Of course, his career is still probably less than half over, but currently Davis is batting nine points higher than his overall lifetime average, and 43 homers is already his second-best number.As you may recall from the beginning of the season, Davis looked better than 2014 yet was on pace to record a startling number of strikeouts. After 27 games (equal to one-sixth of the season), he was on track to register 270 strikeouts!\xc2\xa0 (He will likely end up at about 210.)\xc2\xa0 He had hit six home runs and was batting .250.

Looking over his past 54 games (equaling a third of a season), Davis has put up truly remarkable numbers: 22 home runs and 53 RBIs on a .302 average. Imagine that over a full season: 66 homers and 159 runs batted in. And even with 77 strikeouts over those 54 games, Davis still has had an on base percentage of .422!\xc2\xa0 So he has been very, very good.But here is the problem, the Baltimore Orioles have a cumulative record in those games of just 27-27. So it certainly does take more than one player having stellar numbers to carry a team. It only goes just so far. And honestly, the phrase that says \xe2\x80\x9cputting the team on his back and carrying them\xe2\x80\x9d is really rather worthless in this sport. And looking to the future, I certainly hope the Orioles will have a shot at retaining Davis; but it is clear from this analysis that it is far from the only improvement that has to be made to bring the O\xe2\x80\x99s back to the top of Major League Baseball.Next: Zach Britton lost a game?

It was also covered across various sports media over the weekend. In short, manager\xc2\xa0Matt Williams\xc2\xa0emerged from the Washington dugout in the seventh inning to lift starter\xc2\xa0Max Scherzer. Before I go on, let me preface this by saying that I think Scherzer is one of the best starters in baseball. Any team would be lucky to have him. Furthermore, in what little I see of Washington, I do feel that Williams has a knack for lifting his starters too early and burning out his \xe2\x80\x98pen.\xc2\xa0Live Feed max scherzerFanDuel MLB Daily Picks and Pivots - May 4 Fantasy CPRMLB Aces Yu Darvish and Max Scherzer Love Their Pet Dogs Call to the PenDraftKings MLB Picks For April 28 Fantasy CPRDraftKings Late MLB Picks For April 23 Fantasy CPRWashington Nationals: Bullpen Issues Causing Dusty Baker To Overuse Starters District on DeckMLB Pitchers Bound to Beat Every Major League Team Call to the PenBut as a manager, it\xe2\x80\x99s your right to make poor decisions. If they come back to haunt you, at some point you\xe2\x80\x99ll be held accountable. But it\xe2\x80\x99s still your decision how you operate your team between the lines. However on this night, Scherzer appeared to throw a \xe2\x80\x9chissy-fit\xe2\x80\x9d on the mound. Both he and Williams admitted after the game that profanity was in play on Scherzer\xe2\x80\x99s part. Eventually, Williams appeared to appease his starting pitcher and left him in the game.The final result shows that this was the right decision. Because at the end of the day unfortunately that\xe2\x80\x99s how everything seems to be judged nowadays \xe2\x80\x93 by wins and losses. Not so much by what the moment called for. \xc2\xa0So I do agree with Scherzer that Williams shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought about pulling him in that situation. But that\xe2\x80\x99s really beside the point.Courtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsA relationship between a coach and a player in sports is akin to the one between you and your boss. How many people reading this would have the guts to literally undress their boss in the manner that Scherzer did with Williams? Because Washington ended up winning the game, it\xe2\x80\x99s seen as standing up for what\xe2\x80\x99s right on Scherzer\xe2\x80\x99s part. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also unprofessional \xe2\x80\x93 win or lose.And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing; I partially blame Williams for this. While that might come off as blaming the victim, work with me here for a moment. He obviously decided that he was pulling his starter at that point. As a manager and thus a leader, he has to be decisive in that moment, and thus confident in his decision. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll grant you that his decisions in games have come under constant scrutiny, and perhaps that was in his head. However to be a good coach you have to be a good leader, right?

By turning around and retreating to the dugout, he allowed Max Scherzer to show him up. Again, I suspect that most Washington fans are going to look at it as not being a problem, and perhaps even from the perspective that Williams should have been \xe2\x80\x9cshown up\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 because he was wrong to have tried to pull Scherzer.But look past the game result, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that I\xe2\x80\x99m right. If you manage people in an office, are you really going to allow someone on your team to read you the riot act like that publicly? Please understand; this is not to say that leaders should never listen to their underlings \xe2\x80\x93 because those voices should certainly be heard. Scherzer would have done better to take ten minutes behind closed doors after the game and spoke to Williams in private.But part of being a leader is literally leading. When you allow yourself to be beaten around by someone you\xe2\x80\x99re supposedly managing like that, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t a leader. Take the name of any great coach in sports, and odds are he never let an athlete get out of control like that. Vince Lombardi, Bobby Knight, Phil Jackson, and others come to mind. Heck, think of any boss you\xe2\x80\x99ve had that\xe2\x80\x99s recognized as a great manager. Would that person allow themselves to be publicly humiliated like that?

The scary thing is that yesterday they did. Granted Britton had already technically blown the save in the ninth, but in fact the O\xe2\x80\x99s were playing\xc2\xa0against the odds in a manner of speaking. And they were all but out of the inning\xe2\x80\xa6and then they resorted to conventional wisdom.Kevin Gausman was fairly solid in his start yesterday, although he just missed a quality start. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 8 H, 4 R, 1 BB, 6 K. Gausman showed from the beginning why men on base can be a problem, allowing a run to cross (with a runner on third) on a wild pitch in the first inning. However the Birds tied the score in the third on\xc2\xa0Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single.\xc2\xa0Live Feed zach brittonFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue Call to the PenZach Britton injury update: More forearm pain; sent for MRI FanSidedBaltimore Orioles execute a weird triple play on Boston Red Sox FanSidedMLB: Ranking Top 5 Pitchers Currently on Disabled List Call to the PenOrioles place Zach Britton on DL FanSidedLater in that third inning, Chris Davis stepped\xc2\xa0to the plate with two runners on. And Davis did what Davis does; his three-run home run put the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the lead at 3-1. But we know Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s routine by now\xe2\x80\xa6meaning after all these years.\xc2\xa0Anything you can do, I can do better. Forsythe\xe2\x80\x99s three-run homer in the fifth gave Tampa the lead back at 4-3. However one inning later, the Orioles tied the score back at four on a Janish RBI-single. (Janish got the start at shortstop yesterday to give Hardy a day off.)Janish would also reach base in the eighth inning on a fielding error, and with Pearce on third. This gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 5-4 lead, which in this game was fairly commanding. Parra came up later in the inning and smacked an RBI-single, and the Birds held a big lead at 6-4. Tampa would get a run back on Cabrera\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI in the last of the eighth, but the \xe2\x80\x98pen turned things over to Zach Britton with a one-run lead.And things went awry right away in the last of the ninth when Guyer hit the first pitch of the inning out of the ballpark \xe2\x80\x93 tie game, and a blown save right off the bat. After a strikeout and a triple, Britton intentionally walked Forsythe. That\xe2\x80\x99s when the Orioles started playing for something unconventional to occur \xe2\x80\x93 they brought the infield in. Conventional wisdom in that situation says to play the infield at double-play depth to try to get out of the inning. But with all of the freak things that have happened to the Orioles in games, all it would take would be a soft grounder to an infielder to beat them.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

I believe in managing to the rule asCourtesy of Andy Marlin-USA TODAY Sportsopposed to the exception. So it\xe2\x80\x99s tough for me to fathom when I see a team surrendering the double-play potential like that just to prevent something unorthodox from happening. Britton would walk the next hitter, loading the bases but also giving the Birds a force at every base \xe2\x80\x93 including home. It was only after Britton recorded the second out (by a strikeout) that Showalter moved the infield back.Again speaking for myself, that made me a bit more comfortable. That\xe2\x80\x99s a more conventional look, and a ground ball to any infielder would in theory send the game to extra innings. Britton had an 0-2 count on Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin Kiermaier \xe2\x80\x93 who mind you, can fly on the base paths. And Britton got the play he wanted; a ball in the infield. However it was a soft grounder that took some bounces on the artificial surface at Tropicana Field before settleing in Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s mitt at second. By the time he got the ball to first base, Kieraier had beaten the throw and Tampa had scored the winning run.Ironically, had the Orioles kept their infield in they might have been an out. It also might have bounced right by Schoop at second base. But again it was the least-anticipated thing that ended up beating the Orioles. And in this case they actually did anticipate just such a scenario \xe2\x80\x93 for a part of the inning.\xc2\xa0Sometimes you wonder if the baseball Gods aren\xe2\x80\x99t trying to tell the Orioles quit doing everything by the book all the time! That\xe2\x80\x99s easier said than done; as I said, manage to the rule, not the exception. And that\xe2\x80\x99s good life advice, incidentally.The Orioles will now head to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital for a three-game \xe2\x80\x9cBattle of the Beltways\xe2\x80\x9d series.\xc2\xa0Ubaldo Jimenez\xc2\xa0will\xc2\xa0get the start for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Washington\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Gio Gonzalez. Keep in mind that the Orioles will be playing these three games under National League rules, and thus will be surrendering their DH in all three games in DC.

Wieters and the Birds are there for what was supposed to be a Monday-Wednesday series, but is now Tuesday-Thursday due to last night\xe2\x80\x99s rain out.\xc2\xa0I know, I know\xe2\x80\xa6kind of a petty play on words there. But work with me here for a moment.Courtesy of Richard Mackson-USA TODAY SportsWieters, along with many other Orioles will be free agents at the end of the season. Most Orioles fans rank re-signing Chris Davis\xc2\xa0as\xc2\xa0imperative \xe2\x80\x93 a stance with which I mostly agree. However many of the same people are almost assuming that it\xe2\x80\x99s a foregone conclusion that Wieters will be gone next year. I would submit that one of the two absolutely needs to be on the roster in 2016. Gun to your head if you had to pick one, I\xe2\x80\x99d go with Davis.

The history and quite frankly the bad blood between the two organizations is well-documented. (When I say bad blood I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking on-field; there\xe2\x80\x99s never been any issue between the teams on the field, and by all accounts several players on both sides are friendly off the field.) All the more reason why I found this piece\xc2\xa0by Ken Rosenthal of FOXsports very interesting.Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 agent, Scott Boras, is fairly tight with Washington\xe2\x80\x99s management. And we\xe2\x80\x99d thus be remiss to mention that the Orioles haven\xe2\x80\x99t been his favorite people in the world. Furthermore Washington\xe2\x80\x99s had issues at catcher for some time. Most Washington fans whom I know tell me that they like\xc2\xa0Wilson Ramos, their primary starting catcher. However he\xe2\x80\x99s had issues staying healthy for some time \xe2\x80\x93 although ironically so has Wieters,Nevertheless, the other team that Rosenthal mentions is Atlanta, which makes sense because Wieters went to Georgia Tech and he still lives in the area. I would say this; if Matt Wieters went to either Atlanta or Washington, Orioles fans probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with that (other than the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s no longer with the O\xe2\x80\x99s). That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a best-case scenario given the fact that not only would he be out of the American Leauge, but out of the AL East.Given the tension between the franchises, it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable how fans might not want him to go to Washington. Granted the O\xe2\x80\x99s would still end up facing him several times a year if he ended up there, however that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot different than what would unfold if he ended up with Boston, New York, Toronto, or Tampa. With that said, I maintain that the Orioles need to focus on re-signing both Wieters and Chris Davis \xe2\x80\x93 so as to effectively render this column null and void.As I said, one thing is certain\xe2\x80\xa6Wieters will be playing in Washington this week. In the lineup that was posted for last night, both Wieters and Jones were sitting on the bench. So it\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see if they\xe2\x80\x99re in the lineup tonight. Incidentally, the make up game for last night\xe2\x80\x99s rainout will be at 4 PM on Thursday at Nationals Park.Next: Baltimore Orioles: A look back at clinch-masMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREWASHINGTON (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Ubaldo Jimenez\'s outing Tuesday night wasn\'t always pretty.It was, however, memorable.Jimenez pitched six gritty innings to earn his 100th career win and added an RBI single as the Baltimore Orioles beat the Washington Nationals 4-1 in the rain-delayed opener of a series between teams fighting to remain in the playoff race.The 31-year-old Jimenez (12-9) won his third straight decision for Baltimore, which began the night trailing three teams and six games back for the AL\'s second wild card.""It seems like yesterday that I got to the big leagues and I already have eight years and 100 wins, so it\'s been a really enjoyable moment,"" Jimenez said.The Nationals remained 6 1-2 games back of the Mets, who lost to Atlanta, in the NL East. But New York\'s magic number to clinch the division dropped to six.Jimenez walked five, but allowed just an unearned run on three hits while also striking out five.""I\'ve said it a hundred times, deception is part of his ability to get people out with the fastball and the movement, and that\'s how he creates it,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said when asked about the walks.""You\'re going to have to sometimes live with it,"" Showalter said. That\'s a little bit more than you want to.""Jimenez is having a bounce-back season.

At 23 years old, he becomes the youngest Oriole in history to reach that milestone.

On behalf of Birds Watcher and the Fansided Network, congratulations to Machado on reaching such a milestone!If you would have told me that\xc2\xa0Ubaldo Jimenez\xc2\xa0was going to walk five hitters, I would have probably told you that the O\xe2\x80\x99s were going to fall. But not only did Jimenez work around those walks, he also worked around three uncharacteristic errors behind him. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 3 H, 1 R (0 earned), 5 BB, 5 K. Regarding those walks, some of them were well-earned on Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s part. However home plate umpire Brian O\xe2\x80\x99Nora was also giving the low strike all night, and my personal opinion was that Jimenez got squeezed a few times.\xc2\xa0Live Feed manny machadoBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenManny Machado mashes ball over Green Monster (Video) FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red Sox Call to the PenChris Sale reportedly to be suspended by MLB FanSidedBoston Red Sox Attempt to Hit Manny Machado--Again Call to the PenManny Machado rips the Red Sox for throwing behind him in NSFW rant FanSidedCourtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsIn general, I tend to agree with\xc2\xa0Buck Showalter\xc2\xa0in that having these interleague games this late in the season is probably a bit unfair to an American League team that is having to surrender it\xe2\x80\x99s DH in the process. However at least in this game, Showalter probably can\xe2\x80\x99t complain too much given that Ubaldo Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single in the second inning opened the scoring and gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 1-0 lead. \xc2\xa0And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, the pitchers are in the lineup also. I see no reason why they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t swing the bat. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying to get rid of the DH.A few pitches later the O\xe2\x80\x99s expanded the lead to 2-0 on an RBI-single by\xc2\xa0Nolan Reimold. Washington got to within 2-1 in the fourth when their catcher, Lobaton, reached base on a Schoop fielding error \xe2\x80\x93 he bobbled the ball on what appeared to be a double-play ball with a runner on third. However that run was already destined to be unearned, as the runner on third reached when\xc2\xa0Junior Lake\xc2\xa0opened the inning by dropping a routine fly ball in center.To the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 credit, they closed the door after that. Washington had an opportunity to take control of the game at that moment, but the Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t about to allow that. One inning later in the fifth with Machado on first base, Washington employed a right field shift on\xc2\xa0Chris Davis. With nobody guarding third, he sent a tight grounder down the line \xe2\x80\x93 which was eventually fumbled a bit by Werth in right field. That allowed Machado to score (with a semi-dramatic play at the plate), and gave the Orioles a 3-1 lead. Davis ended up at second base, and he later scored on\xc2\xa0Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-double.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

09/24/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado in the Eye of the Storm ...', 'Sep 23, 2015; Washington, DC, USA; Baltimore Orioles third baseman Manny Machado (13) leans back to get out of the way of Washington Nationals relief pitcher Jonathan Papelbon (not pictured) pitch in the ninth inning at Nationals Park. Baltimore Orioles defeated Washington Nationals 4-3. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsMake no mistake about it. Jonathan Papelbon is the most disgusting player in baseball. And this is not a view I have come to just this now after seeing him throw at the head of Manny Machado, not once, but twice. You see, it took two pitches to hit Machado because pucker-face wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough to get it done the first time.I am far from alone in this viewpoint of the jerk. Former teammates despise him. His reputation as irksome and combative with just about everyone is well-established. He dissed his old teammates in Philly, while in Washington the new clubhouse was, well, less than celebratory to hear he was joining them at the trade deadline. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not link to the dozens upon dozens of articles that chronicle the continual oozing of crap that surrounds him. Google search it; it is all over the Net.But it seems too that Manny Machado is never far from the center of a storm. Around baseball he is becoming one of those less than well-liked players with opposing fanbases.Manny has made a few mistakes in letting his competitive spirit and emotions get the best of him\xe2\x80\x94a fellow who is still younger than 90-something percent of all players. So there is that; and here on The Baltimore Wire we have been fair in pointing that out when it has happened. Call this about 25% of why he is in the midst of the storm. More from Baltimore Orioles5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen workBut I am going to say that the other 75% is a combination of a fiery desire to excel and win, along with the focus that is upon a player who (as of Wednesday night) is a 30-homer guy with the seventh-highest WAR (wins above replacement) stat in all of baseball.The Machado competitive temperament was seen on Wednesday night in Washington. Early in the game he requested time at the plate but did not get it. He was furious with the rookie umpire (who did not have a good day at the office). Manny fumed about it, repeating that it was bull manure all of the way to the dugout, and he was still yelling several minutes later. Frankly, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather see this than the Chris Davis oft-passive response of nothing more than a quick glance, even when he is unjustly called out on a pitch six inches off the plate.So Machado was already annoyed, while at the same time another emotional player in Max Scherzer was pitching for the Nationals. He was approaching 120 pitches and attempting to get his final out of the evening by setting down Machado. Scherzer went for several walks around the mound, having just thrown 98 mph in the inning. He was hyperventilating like a bull seeing red.With a 2-2 count on Machado, Scherzer was clearly muscling up to throw one past the O\xe2\x80\x99s third baseman and get out of the seventh inning with a 3-2 lead. Obviously a four-seamer was coming, which it did at 98 mph, but catching the center of the plate. And Scherzer\xe2\x80\x99s 122nd pitch of the evening was soon out of the park in left field, and the Orioles had a 4-3 lead that would prove to be the final score.Machado did not appear to flip the bat or make a scene rounding the bases, but he was very pumped up about it, with a big gesture to the heavens when touching the plate. There was a good bit of pumped-up verbal AND body language as he returned to the dugout. Did this annoy the Nationals, particularly Papelbon? One would think so.Pucker-face did not leave the dugout after getting tossed from the game\xe2\x80\x94a violation. Flipping back and forth to both broadcasts, both were talking about how he was not supposed to be on the bench. Maybe the league office will yet have an opinion on this.Bryce Harper might want to stay a bit nimble on his feet in the series finale on Thursday afternoon.Next: Looking at how Yogi Berra performed against the Orioles ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado in the middle of it all', ""Let\xe2\x80\x99s cut right to the chase; Washington felt that Manny Machado of the Baltimore Orioles looked at his seventh inning home run for a bit too long last night. Or at least Jonathan Papelbon (who didn\xe2\x80\x99t even give up the home run) thought he did. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always said that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with a pitcher throwing at a player in that instance. However it\xe2\x80\x99s how it happened that was a problem.Chris Tillman gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a great outing last night, and due to some good timing was able to walk away with his tenth victory of the season. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 6 H, 3 R, 3 BB, 5 K. Needless to say, it was a quality start. Tillman had the lead from the beginning, as Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer gave the Birds a 2-0 lead in the top of the first. However Tillman struggled with command a bit in the last of the inning, and he gave up an RBI-single to Yunel Escobar to leave the score at 2-1\xc2\xa0Live Feed manny machadoBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenManny Machado mashes ball over Green Monster (Video) FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red Sox Call to the PenChris Sale reportedly to be suspended by MLB FanSidedBoston Red Sox Attempt to Hit Manny Machado--Again Call to the PenManny Machado rips the Red Sox for throwing behind him in NSFW rant FanSidedWashington would tie things up in the last of the fifth when catcher Wilson Ramos\xe2\x80\x99 RBI-double scored Michael Taylor. Later in the innin they would the lead on Anthony Rendon\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI. At that point it appeared that it could be a matter of recording outs the rest of the way for Washington. However manager Matt Williams uncharacteristically left starter Max Scherzer in for one hitter too many in the seventh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and it was Machado who benefited from that decision.On a 2-2 count with a runner on and two outs, Machado got a hanging slider. He jumped on it, and hit it into the \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cRed Porch\xe2\x80\x9d area of Nationals Park. That gave Tillman a chance to be the winner, reliant on what the bullpen did. And the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pen held on well, with Mychal Givens pitching two solid innings and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day getting the save in the ninth.Again, the belief was that Machado may have held his pose at home plate for a bit longer than he needed to do. So when Machado came to bat in the top of the ninth with two away, he started off with a pitch up close to Machado\xe2\x80\x99s head \xe2\x80\x93 high and tight. That seemed to give Machado pause, but the second pitch was well out of the zone but away from Machado. Then Papelbon landed his intent pitch on the third try, hitting Machado in the upper shoulder area.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal2/17 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Johnson wants to revitalize his careerCourtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsPapelbon was immediately ejected after hitting Machado, who was none too pleased at what had taken place. Buck Showalter raced out of the dugout to ensure that his player didn\xe2\x80\x99t escalate the situation, and both benches cleared. In general, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the business of interpreting intent. However there was little doubt that Papelbon hit Machado intentionally. Apparently Papelbon was the only person in the park who didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so, as he and manager Matt Williams vehemently protested his ejection.Again, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to hit someone intentionally for something that happened earlier (such as admiring a home run), I do understand that. However it should never be done in the vicinty of the head \xe2\x80\x93 you bury the pitch in the guy\xe2\x80\x99s back or thigh. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Machado took exception to the pitch \xe2\x80\x93 it was the location, not the pitch itself (quote courtesy of Roch Kubatko of MASNsports):I don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily think I\xe2\x80\x99m being targeted. I\xe2\x80\x99m going up there making good swings. If people are trying to hit me, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the game. I\xe2\x80\x99m not worried about getting hit. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the hits. Its part of the game. Pitchers out there, the ball can slip out of your hand, but when you throw at the head on first pitch right from the get-go, then you throw a curveball and then you throw again at the head, that\xe2\x80\x99s just bull(crap). It\xe2\x80\x99s coward stuff. It\xe2\x80\x99s just cowardly.Again, the act of hitting someone isn\xe2\x80\x99t the part that\xe2\x80\x99s cowardly, it\xe2\x80\x99s the location. Furtherore the sanity in doing it when it was done (in the ninth inning of a one-run game that was very winnable from Washington\xe2\x80\x99s standpoint) is questionable on Papelbon\xe2\x80\x99s part also. Contrary to what some might say, throwing at someone is part of the game if you feel that player showed you up in some manner. I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that Machado showed Washington up (or that he did not); I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying that there was an impression that he waited a little too long to run. Maybe he did, maybe he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. But targeting someone\xe2\x80\x99s head is bush league \xe2\x80\x93 and is NOT part of the game.The series concludes this afternoon on what was previously a day off for both teams. Rookie Tyler Wilson will get the start for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Tanner Roark.

The series marked the first time this season the front-runner for the NL MVP award has been hitless in three consecutive games.""It\'s disappointing,"" Nationals manager Matt Williams said, ""that we didn\'t win these games.""Washington entered the day 6 1/2 games behind the NL East-leading New York Mets.""It\'s not great,"" Williams conceded. ""Not where we want to be.""Asked to characterize the Nationals\' mood after their bullpen blew yet another lead, Ian Desmond said: ""Frustrated. But as long as we have a chance, there\'s still hope.""There were no beanballs and no brawl, a day after Washington closer Jonathan Papelbon hit Manny Machado with a pitch in the ninth, two innings after Machado hit a go-ahead two-run homer off Max Scherzer to give Baltimore a 4-3 victory.That led Harper to surmise: ""I\'ll probably get drilled tomorrow.""Even as much of the pregame chatter Thursday centered on that possibility, both managers tried to downplay such speculation.""Retaliation? You\'re not supposed to do that,"" Baltimore\'s Buck Showalter said. ""The best retaliation would be to win another game, right? That\'s usually how it works.""And so that\'s what his club did, thanks in large part to Matt Wieters\' two-run homer off Blake Treinen (2-4) in the eighth inning.""Winning three games,"" Showalter said afterward, \'is the best \'back at ya.\'""Both clubs hold the slimmest of playoff hopes: Baltimore entered Thursday four games out of the second AL wild-card spot.But the Orioles have won 11 of their past 15 games to at least keep themselves within shouting distance.The Nationals have won only seven of their last 16 games.Baltimore went ahead 3-0 on Machado\'s RBI single in the first and Jonathan Schoop\'s two-run shot in the fourth. But Wilson Ramos\' homer and Yunel Escobar\'s pair of run-scoring hits helped the Nationals go up 4-3 entering the eighth.Steve Pearce greeted Blake Treinen (2-4) with a single, and Wieters followed with his seventh homer, putting the Orioles out front for good.""I haven\'t hit one good for a few weeks,"" Wieters said.Treinen blamed poor location for a pitch that stayed up.""Nobody wants to fail, especially with the implications that we\'re still in the race,"" Treinen said.Mike Wright (3-5) got two outs in the seventh for the victory. Brad Brach threw a scoreless eighth, and Darren O\'Day pitched the ninth for his sixth save of the season and third of the series. Harper\'s groundout to Machado ended it.Another chance for Harper came in the fifth, when Washington scored twice and had a man on first with one out as Harper came up to face rookie starter Tyler Wilson. A comebacker set up an inning-ending 1-6-3 double play.Washington could have scored more in the seventh, but Anthony Rendon was thrown out at home by second baseman Schoop on a relay from center fielder Gerardo Parra.

09/25/2015,"[('Bob Haynie: Orioles Back To .500 \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' On September 7, the Baltimore Orioles suffered a disappointing 8-6 defeat at the hands of the New York Yankees. That Labor Day setback at Yankee Stadium dropped the Birds to 65-72 and was their 15th loss in 18 games. For all intents and purposes, Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of getting to the playoffs for the third time in four years were dashed. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a good run. See you in spring training.  At least that\xe2\x80\x99s what some of us thought.  Since that game, the Orioles have been playing some good baseball and they have been winning. A lot. Just ask the Washington Nationals who were the victims of a three-game Baltimore sweep.  The Birds have been victorious in 11 of their last 15 contests and are back to a .500 record. Heading into this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s three-game series against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway, the Orioles are sporting a 76-76 mark and have moved to within 3.5 games of the second American League Wild Card spot.  Only 10 regular season games remain and the chances of the Orioles getting to the playoffs are still slim. But their recent run of success has given them at least a glimmer of hope. After the Red Sox, the Birds return to Camden Yards for four games with the AL East-leading Toronto Blue Jays and then will face the probably playoff-bound Yankees for three more. Two teams are ahead of the Orioles (Twins and Angels) in their quest to catch the fading Houston Astros for the second wild-card berth.  The Twins, who swept seven games from the Orioles this season, have three games at Detroit, four at Cleveland and will finish their schedule with three at home against K.C. The Twins, like the Angles, are 1.5 games behind Houston.  The Angels will host Seattle for three games and then follow that with three more at home against Oakland. They close out their regular season with four games on the road against the AL West-leading Texas Rangers.

The biggest mistake he said he made was challenging David Ortiz during a three-run sixth.""I probably let my ego get the best of me,"" Gausman said.

Ortiz then hit a deep shot to right, just out of the reach of Alvarez.Pedroia, who held up to see if the ball was caught so he could tag, beat the relay throw by going in headfirst before Bogaerts slid in ahead of Joseph\'s tag. Brock Holt\'s RBI double made it 5-0.The 35-year-old Hill (2-0) was released by Washington in June, then played for the Long Island Ducks in an independent league before signing a minor league deal with the Red Sox in August.Hill threw his second career shutout \xe2\x80\x94 the other came in 2006 with the Chicago Cubs. The game ended when right fielder Mookie Betts made a leaping catch at the wall, robbing Chris Davis of a homer.Hill gave up a hit to the first batter he faced before holding Baltimore hitless until Dariel Alvarez opened the ninth with an infield single.Earlier this month, Hill became the first Red Sox pitcher to fan 10 or more in his initial two starts.Ortiz had three doubles and three RBIs as Boston stopped a three-game losing streak. Xander Bogaerts added three hits and drove in a run.The Orioles were coming off a three-game sweep of the Nationals.Hill hadn\'t started in the majors in six years before coming up in September.

That gave the Birds a 3-1 lead, and put them in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\xc2\xa0Live Feed chris tillmanBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman is trying to get back on track The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: What to Make of Recent Stellar Starts by Jimenez, Miley The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Is five straight quality starts too much to ask for? The Baltimore WireBlue Jays Easter Optimism Jays JournalPerhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair of me to say that Flaherty is an unlikely source for a home run. After all he did have a big homer in Washington last week. There are a lot of fans who tell me that they question why Ryan Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s on the team. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come through all the time, but nobody does. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that you need him until you need him. However in the tradition of Tom Matte with the Baltimore Colts, he can come through in the clutch with the best of them.The Birds lifted Tillman with one out and one on in the eighth. Speaking for myself, I would have thought a game in which the starter made it that far and that good would have been a win. However this Toronto team refuses to lose to the Orioles. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day gave up an RBI-single to Revere, which cut the lead to 3-2 (that run was charged to Tillman). Jose Bautista then smacked another RBI-single to tie the game \xe2\x80\x93 Bautista was tagged out trying to advance to second base.Justin Smoak reached on a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice in the ninth, allowing a runner to score from third. That gave Toronto a 4-3 lead, and a 4-3 win at that \xe2\x80\x93 with Brad Brach taking the loss. These types of games are difficult to stomach if you\xe2\x80\x99re the Orioles, however needless to say perhaps the bullpen is as tired as some of the bats in the lineup right now. However as I said, Toronto just refuses to lose to the Orioles, and I suspect that has a lot to do with it.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

When Harper flied out against the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday, Papelbon scolded him for not running hard to first base. After some more words were exchanged, Papelbon lunged at Harper and grabbed him by the throat in the dugout. Teammates separated them.It has been a disappointing season for the Nationals, who were expected to contend. Instead, the team blew a four-game division lead to the Mets and was eliminated from playoff contention. Papelbon is 2-2 with a 3.04 E.R.A. and seven saves since joining the team in a trade with the Phillies over the summer.After his altercation with Harper on Sunday, Papelbon was sent out to pitch the ninth inning and was charged with five runs and a loss.In Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game, the Nationals right-hander Max Scherzer (13-12) came within five outs of his second no-hitter of the season, shutting down Cincinnati into the eighth inning and striking out 10 batters.

09/30/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles Chris Tillman: Lacking a Put-Away Pitch', ""Sep 6, 2015; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Baltimore Orioles catcher Steve Clevenger (45) talks with Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Chris Tillman (30) during the third inning in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre. Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsWhile watching a Baltimore Orioles game recently in which Chris Tillman was the starting pitcher, as batter after batter fouled off two-strike pitches, the MASN announcer said \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cFor a pitcher who has now made over 145 career starts, and given the variety of pitches he throws, Tillman still has not really developed a put-away pitch to get a greater number of strikeouts.\xe2\x80\x9d This is a very good overall observation about Tillman. He has been slowly improving each year by cutting down on endless at-bats and elevated pitch counts, though his performance has taken a step back this current year.Tillman is at his best when he pounds the corners of the strike zones, as was done on Monday against the Jays in his very good start \xe2\x80\x94 giving up two runs in 7.1 innings. He threw 69 out of 104 pitches for strikes. And though he only had three strikeouts, the high percentage of strikes forced the hitters to swing and put balls into play. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s movement on pitches was better than average, and he was therefore more pitch efficient.Honestly, Tillman does not have the pitch movement possessed by most of the other Orioles pitchers. But is it imagination that he does not have a put-away pitch, or do statistics support this general observation?Let me give you two categories of stats, comparing the other Orioles starters: Ubaldo Jimenez, Wei-Yin Chen, Kevin Gausman and Miguel Gonzalez, along with Zach Britton thrown into the mix.General Stats \xe2\x80\x93 Earned Run Average / Batting Average Against / Strikeouts per 9 innings / Walks per 9 innings / Pitches Per Plate Appearance \xe2\x80\xa6PitcherERABAAK9BB9PPATillman5.05.2656.23.23.98Jimenez4.10.2578.13.33.86Chen3.35.2647.31.83.79Gausman4.49.2558.02.74.04Gonzalez4.85.2706.83.13.91Britton2.01.21711.12.03.57\xc2\xa0First, it is striking to see Tillman \xe2\x80\x94 the presumptive staff ace \xe2\x80\x94 with the highest ERA of this group. Of course much of this came from his Canadian-based nemeses known as the Blue Jays. But notice also that he does possess the least number of strikeouts per nine innings, even fewer than Miguel Gonzalez. It is also interesting to see that he has walked batters at a ratio rather close to Jimenez. That is never a resume enhancement.But the striking number in this graph is the final column of pitches per plate appearance. Only Gausman averages more. The difference may seem rather miniscule, but consider the number of batters a starter sees in a game. Say that a pitcher goes 6.2 innings \xe2\x80\x94 a good goal for a starter. That averages about 30 batters. Comparing the .19 difference between Tillman and Chen, that adds up to about seven pitches difference.This second graph is even more indicative of the specific lack of a put-away pitch. It tracks the total number of occasions where a pitcher has two strikes on the batter (could be 0-2, 1-2, 2-2, or 3-2) \xe2\x80\xa6 noting what happens in this situation.Two Strikes in the Count \xe2\x80\x93 Plate Appearances / Strikeouts / Percentage of K\xe2\x80\x99s with 2 Strikes / Batting Average Against PitcherPAK% of K\xe2\x80\x99sBAATillman35011532.9.199Jimenez37516142.9.181Chen39815037.7.197Gausman2449338.1.193Gonzalez30910634.3.214Britton1277760.6.115\xc2\xa0This charts the exact situations where a put-away pitch is needed. Note that, again, of this list of O\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers, Tillman has the lowest percentage number of strikeouts. Britton, of course, has the ultimate put-away pitch. And Jimenez is difficult to hit, especially when he commands the strike zone.

I would say that his best pitch, when commanded, is his curve. It is brutal and has tremendous drop and \xe2\x80\x9cdepth\xe2\x80\x9d in the zone. Of course, finding that depth is where the devil is in the details.In any event, identifying and deploying a put-away pitch for two-strike situations could be the single item that most helps Tillman kick his career up a notch \xe2\x80\x94 positioning him where he really could be a genuine staff ace. He has many games over the course of a season where he is very, very good. This could make him great.Next: These are the times that try fans' souls.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore49m agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley2h agoBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels1 d agoNBA Playoffs 2017: Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre suspended for Game 41 d agoDoes Wizards\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Oubre deserve suspension after Game 3 altercation?1 d ago "", 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"
10/01/2015,"[(""Weather could wreak havoc on MLB's final weekend"", ""A member of the Baltimore Orioles grounds crew spreads dirt during a weather delay in Baltimore during a game against the Toronto Blue Jays.(Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREThe New York Yankees may be reeling down the stretch trying to clinch a playoff berth, but Hurricane Joaquin may come to their rescue.The Yankees, who have lost 13 of their last 22 games, need just one more victory or a loss by the Astros or Angels to clinch their wild-card spot, but Hurricane Joaquin could assure that the wild-card game will be in New York.The Yankees have three fewer losses than the Astros and Angels, leaving them with a magic number of two to clinch the top wild card spot and play host to the Astros,\xc2\xa0Angels or Texas Rangers on Tuesday.Yet, if inclement weather - some of it wrought by the movement north of Hurricane Joaquin - \xc2\xa0causes a postponement of their last games in New York on Thursday night or Baltimore this weekend, they won't necessarily need\xc2\xa0to make them up, since it would involve only home field and not a playoff berth.\xe2\x80\x9cOur general policy is that if the games are meaningful,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 MLB vice president Pat Courtney said, \xe2\x80\x9call 162 games have to be played. We will continue to monitor this situation over the last four days of the season.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99The big question is whether \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 translates into home-field advantage. .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; } .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; } .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; } .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; } p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  } p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYBlue Jays clinch AL East with 15-2 win over OriolesThe Toronto Blue Jays, who were playing in rain Thursday afternoon in Baltimore, won\xe2\x80\x99t have that luxury if their game is completed against the Orioles. The game was moved from 7 p.m. ET to noon due to forecast worries, but it began under a drizzle.Eventually, Camden Yards got pounded by a steady downpour and umpires - after pleadings from Blue Jays manager John Gibbons - called a rain delay after one inning and the Orioles leading 3-0. It is expected they will be able to complete the game by some point Thursday.The Blue Jays, 92-66, have a one-game advantage over the Kansas City Royals, 91-67, for home-field advantage, and have the tie-breaker advantage. Yet, their last three games are under the roof in St. Petersburg, Fla., where they will play the Tampa Bay Rays the final three games. The Royals are in Minneapolis to play the Twins, where inclement weather is always possible, although the weekend forecast does not call for rain.Should the Blue Jays\xe2\x80\x99 game Thursday get postponed, and home field advantage still remains undecided, it will be interesting to see if MLB would force the Blue Jays to play the game Monday. The Blue Jays, since they already expanded to a 40-man roster, could send in a \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 squad to play that game, and not use any regulars or one of their normal starting pitchers.Yet, there are repercussions. Whoever finishes with the best record in the league plays the wild-card winner. The No. 2 seed would have to play the AL West winner, which likely would be Texas. The Rangers\xc2\xa0could start lefty ace Cole Hamels in a Game 1, as opposed to a wild card club that had to burn its No. 1 starter merely to advance to the AL Division Series.While the National League picture is far clearer, weather has already\xc2\xa0impacted\xc2\xa0the New York Mets. Like the Orioles-Blue Jays contest, their Thursday game at Philadelphia was moved from 7 p.m. ET to noon. The Mets lost the game 3-0, and a Los Angeles Dodgers win at San Francisco on later Thursday would drop the clubs into a tie for the NL's No. 2 seed.The Mets finish with three games at home against Washington, and there's a 90% chance of rain Friday night in New York. The weekend forecast looks more forgiving, but the club could face the specter of playing a weekend doubleheader to preserve home field advantage in the first round.The Mets won the season series with the Dodgers and would have home-field advantage should the teams remain tied.The Pittsburgh Pirates, who were eliminated from the NL Central race on Wednesday, will play the Chicago Cubs in the wild-card game Wednesday. They\xe2\x80\x99re now relegated to facing Cy Young candidate Jake Arrieta, but would certainly prefer to play the Cubs at PNC Park than at Wrigley Field. They have a 2 1/2-game\xc2\xa0lead over the Cubs for home-field, meaning that if the Cubs win out, the Pirates would have to win two of three games against the Cincinnati Reds. If they have any rainouts, they also would be relegated to a doubleheader, or even be forced to play on Monday.Certainly, MLB can be relieved weather should be no factor involving the AL West and the second wild card club. The Rangers, who lead the AL West by 2 \xc2\xbd games, play the final four games against the Angels at home in Arlington, Texas. And the Astros are under the roof in Arizona to play their final three games against the Arizona Diamondbacks. .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; } .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; } .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; } .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; } p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  } p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } FOR THE WIN17 awesome things about the St. Louis CardinalsThe Twins, meanwhile, lurk just 1 1/2 games back\xc2\xa0in the wild-card race. If any of their games would be postponed, MLB would require those games to be played. They would have to play a doubleheader, just as they did Wednesday in Cleveland, or if necessary, push any postponed game until Monday. And if the Twins won, it could force a tiebreaker into Tuesday and delay the American League wild-card game to Wednesday, with the AL Division Series starting Thursday.In other words, baseball could have a real soggy mess.GALLERY: MLB's postseason celebrationsFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInMLB teams celebrate postseason berths\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Champagne, no. The Toronto Blue Jays ended baseball's longest playoff drought without even knowing about it. Toronto enters play believing it could clinch a wild card by beating the Tampa Bay Rays, and with losses by Minnesota and the Los Angeles Angels. Not long after the Blue Jays beat the Rays 5-3, Minnesota lost 6-4 at Detroit. But when the Angels defeated Seattle 8-4, it looked as if Toronto would need one more victory Saturday to halt its 22-year postseason absence. It turns out, however, that because of the remaining schedules of the Rangers, Astros and Angels, the Blue Jays had clinched at least a wild-card spot, no matter what.\xc2\xa0                                      Peter Llewellyn, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen                                     Sept. 24: Kansas City's Eric Hosmer and Mike Moustakas celebrate after clinching the AL Central.\xc2\xa0                                      Pool Photo, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen                                     Sept. 24: Royals outfielder Jonny Gomez celebrates after clinching the AL Central.\xc2\xa0                                      SA TODAY SportsFullscreen                                     Sept. 24: Royals catcher Salvador Perez spills the bubbly.\xc2\xa0                                      John Rieger, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen                                     Sept. 24: Royals players storm the field after clinching the AL Central.\xc2\xa0                                      John Rieger, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen                                     Sept. 23: The Pirates celebrate after clinching their third consecutive playoff berth.\xc2\xa0                                      Ron Chenoy, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen                                     September 23: Pirates players celebrate clinching a playoff spot.\xc2\xa0                                      Doug Pensinger, Getty ImagesFullscreen                                     September 23: Pittsburgh's Josh Harrison, right, and Elias Diaz celebrate after clinching a playoff spot.\xc2\xa0                                      Jack Dempsey, APFullscreen                                     September 23: Pittsburgh's Gregory Polanco Aramis Ramirez take a selfie after clinching a postseason spot.\xc2\xa0                                      Doug Pensinger, Getty ImagesFullscreen                                     Sept. 19: Despite the loss, the St. Louis Cardinals became first team to clinch playoff berth.

10/03/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Strange Ending to a Strange Season', 'Oct 1, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; A general view of the game between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Baltimore Orioles in the fourth inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles won 6-4. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY SportsIt has indeed been a strange season for the Baltimore Orioles. The high hopes after the 96-win 2014 campaign have led to the most common word describing this year \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cdisappointing.\xe2\x80\x9dThe weirdness began early. Spring training was not great, as significant pieces of the team struggled. Bud Norris was dreadful, got terribly sick, and never figured it out. J.J. Hardy was hurt, with an injury we found out this week lingered throughout the year. Matt Wieters was not ready for the beginning of the year.After getting off to a 7-10 start, the Orioles won three straight, the first two of these being a Saturday walk-off homer, 10th-inning shot by David Lough that beat Koji Uehara and the Red Sox 5-4. The next day the Birds pasted them 18-7 on a Sunday with 43,800 fans.But then came the riots. And the O\xe2\x80\x99s would not play again until that weird, zero attendance game on a Wednesday afternoon against the White Sox, winning 8-2 and evening their record at 10-10.The venue for the coming weekend series with the Rays was moved to St. Petersburg, where the Orioles would win two of the three games. But the Orioles were several games played behind everyone else. They would next lose four straight, and thus continued the mediocre up and down season that hovered around .500 \xe2\x80\xa6 getting seven games above on June 28, and falling seven games under on September 7th. \xc2\xa0 They could just never get over the hump and sustain a streak as in recent years. More from Baltimore Orioles5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen workSome of the baseball statistical sites (like the awesome baseball-reference.com) track something called the \xe2\x80\x9cPythagorean W-L\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 a mathematical calculation that states what a team\xe2\x80\x99s record should be relative to their number of runs scored versus runs allowed. If you have a very equal number of each, it should mean that your record will be about .500. If you have many more runs scored than allowed, it would stand to mathematical reason that your record should reflect that by being well above 50/50, or, at the end well above 81-81.This does not always work out in real life, which is why they play the games and keep score each day. At the moment of this writing (between games of the Yankees double-header, two games before the end of the season), the Orioles have a 79-81 record. They have outscored opponents this year 700-686, and therefore their record should be a bit better at 82-78.Until recently, the Orioles were actually in the top quarter of teams; and even though the Orioles were 14-13 in September, they were outscored by 31 runs over that one-sixth of the season.Another great oddity in this regard was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 2012 season, where they barely outscored opponents, yet won 93 games. It was the year of winning all of those one-run and extra-inning games. That was a special team, and it spoke so well of them that they were able to do that.Here is a chart over the past five years (remembering that this is lacking the final two games this year), noting what the Pythagorean W/L should be, and what the final record was \xe2\x80\xa6YearRunsAllowedPyth. W/LRecord201170886067-9569-93201271270582-8093-69201374570985-7785-77201470559394-6896-66201570068482-7879-81\xc2\xa0Charting these numbers does show just how well the pitching performed last year. And it also shows a rather remarkable similarity in runs scored, with a narrow variable over the five years.But in every year of the past five, except for this year, the Orioles played at least at or better (way better in 2012) than the simple expectation upon total runs scored or allowed. And this adds more weight beyond the general observation that this was a team that never put it together with their pitching and hitting and overall play as a unit. And it shows that there is more than enough blame to go around.Next: The Top 7 Players for the Orioles in September ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Ranking the Roster - Birds Watcher', ""Sep 19, 2015; St. Petersburg, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Wei-Yin Chen (16) throws a pitch during the seventh inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsAs the Orioles wind down their mildly disappointing 2015 season, trying to take stock of the roster going into the off season is somewhat exhausting. However the exercise might shed some light on how the Orioles Front Office should proceed as preparations for the Hot Stove League get underway.The season began with a lot of anxiety about overcoming the loss of 2014 Most Valuable Oriole Nelson Cruz, fan favorite Rightfielder Nick Markakis, and late inning Ace Andrew Miller.\xc2\xa0Live Feed chris davisBaltimore Orioles execute a weird triple play on Boston Red Sox FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Buck Showalter's Most Memorable Ejections The Baltimore WireWATCH: Chris Davis goes into Bo Jackson mode on bat FanSidedDraftKings Late MLB Picks For April 14 Fantasy CPRBaltimore Orioles: A hot start for Chris Davis could offset a trend of missed postseason appearances The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: How long can one of the best infields in the league stay together? The Baltimore WireThere was good reason for nail biting. A return to the Play Offs was highly dependent on a lot of Orioles Magic, including over achieving Steve Pearce maintaining the level of play that saw him lead the team in WAR in 2014, and cast offs Travis Snider and Alejandro De Aza filling holes left by Cruz and Markakis.While the Orioles were technically alive into late September, any fan will attest that it just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been their year.As the players begin to make their vacation plans for the Fall, let\xe2\x80\x99s rank the top 10 Orioles of 2015.1. Chris DavisThe man they call Crush bounced back in a big way in 2015, raising his batting average by 62 points, his Home Run total by 19, and his RBI total by 40, with three games to go. He leads the Major League\xe2\x80\x99s in Home Runs for the second time in three seasons and his OPS is 200 points higher from 2014 to 2015. All of this while playing almost flawless defense with only 3 errors on the season, good for a .998 Fielding Percentage.Imagine\xc2\xa0if this Chris Davis had been manning First Base during the 2014 ALCS\xe2\x80\xa62. Manny MachadoAfter Manny\xe2\x80\x99s breakout 2013 season, at only 20 years old, many predicted his League leading 51 doubles were an indication of future power. Although correct, few saw it coming this soon. Indeed, Manny has essentially turned almost half of those doubles into Home Runs this season, with 33 long balls and 30 doubles to date. He leads the team in Batting Avg at .287 and WAR at 6.9. His defensive prowess is an afterthought because eye popping plays have become routine. Simply put, Machado has the talent to be the best player in baseball.3. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99DayAndrew Miller was not much of a loss for the Orioles in 2015 due to the performance of O\xe2\x80\x99Day. He leads the team with a 1.54 ERA and has been almost automatic in keeping the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the game with a Walks/Hits per inning ratio (WHIP) under 1.00. O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s ability to miss bats often times makes hitters plain angry and his bulldog attitude gives the bullpen an edge.4. Adam JonesIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a tough year for Jones and yet he still put up All Star numbers while playing outstanding Centerfield. Part of his frustration has been due to rarely being 100% healthy. He\xe2\x80\x99ll finish the season with his lowest Games Played total since 2009 but many of his numbers are not too far off from his 2014 output. He\xe2\x80\x99s the emotional leader of the Orioles who sometimes takes the team\xe2\x80\x99s struggles personally. He\xe2\x80\x99s seemed worn out at times this season but he has a tremendous hunger to win and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be back at full strength in 2016.5. Wei-Yin ChenChen has been the most consistent Starting Pitcher for Baltimore this season and should command a lot of attention in Free Agency as a lefty that rarely walks hitters. He averages 1.2 walks per start versus 5 K\xe2\x80\x99s and obviously leads Orioles starters in WHIP.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue Call to the Pen6. Zach BrittonOne of the top Closers in Baseball, Britton strikes out more than a batter per inning and his ability to get ground ball outs with the top defense in Baseball behind him makes him the perfect pitcher to shut the door for the Orioles.7. Jonathan SchoopOne of the most exciting aspects of the 2015 season has been the emergence of Schoop who has 17 doubles and 15 Home Runs in just over 300 at bats after recovering from injury. He\xe2\x80\x99s also batted a solid .279 while playing excellent defense. Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s stats projected over a full season would make him a top 3 Second baseman in the league, which definitely gives Orioles fans hope for the future.8. Kevin GausmanIt seemed like the light went on for Gausman during the 2014 play offs and he appeared poised to vault to stardom in 2015, however the Orioles knew better and brought him along slowly again. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s last start showed what he is capable of doing when he combines his electric stuff with efficient pitch management. His biggest problem has been consistently finishing hitters off, seeming to be unwilling to use a 4 seam fastball to get hitters chasing up in the zone. If he can put it together, 2016 may be the year he finally realizes his Ace potential.\xc2\xa0More from Chris Davis7/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Davis sets up win in the twilight zone6/27 - Baltimore Orioles complete the sweep of Tampa6/14 - Will Chris Davis Continue His Impressive Home Run Streak?6/10 - Baltimore Orioles: Comeback kids led by Chris Davis6/1 - Baltimore Orioles: Fair is foul, foul is fair9. Ubaldo JimenezJimenez has been the source of much disdain from Oriole fans but he actually was the stopper of the starting rotation over the first few months of the season. He\xe2\x80\x99s been an improvement after a horrid first season in Baltimore and has the ability to dominate at times. He leads the team in Wins and Strikeouts but fans expect more. Although he\xe2\x80\x99s been solid this season it\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible Dan Duquette spends a considerable amount of time trying to move him now that two years of his contract are in the books.10. Caleb JosephJoseph has quietly shown that he can be the starting Catcher of the Baltimore Orioles moving forward, making the decision on Matt Wieters much easier for the Front Office. He\xe2\x80\x99s a solid bat in the back end of the order, currently fourth on the team in RBI, while playing defense at a .996 clip and throwing out 32% of base runners.With some tough decisions to make in the off season, a ranking of the top 10 Orioles of 2015 indicates that Davis is a priority to resign, a solid play should be made for Chen, and the team should pass on Wieters. Furthermore, O\xe2\x80\x99Day will likely command attention as a possible Closer from other teams but unless the Orioles think Mychal Givens is ready for 8th inning duty, O\xe2\x80\x99Day is a high priority as well.Let the Hot Stove League begin!Next: Baltimore Orioles: Hidden advantage on Chris Davis?More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season10w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

It can\xe2\x80\x99t mount anymore.\xe2\x80\x9dIf pressure is running out, panic is steadily filling the room.The Yankees lost both games of a doubleheader to the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday, 9-2 and 4-3, giving them five losses in six games and reducing the opportunities they have to ensure that they do not have to travel to Texas \xe2\x80\x94 to face either the Rangers or the Houston Astros \xe2\x80\x94 for the one-game playoff.For the game to be played in the Bronx, the Yankees must win Sunday, or the Astros must lose to the Arizona Diamondbacks, whom the Astros defeated, 6-2, on Saturday.

Britton then retired Chase Headley to end a taut game.The Yankees may have shrugged after losing the opener, but the atmosphere in the clubhouse was much tenser by the end of the night, after the team had gone a combined 3 for 19 with runners in scoring position in the two games.

Not only has the Astros\xe2\x80\x99 ace, Dallas Keuchel, thrown 16 shutout innings against the Yankees this season, he is 15-0 at home with a 1.46 E.R.A.

Perhaps it was the 53-degree weather or lingering effects of the celebration after Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s playoff-clinching win or thoughts about Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s wild-card playoff.Whatever it was, the Yankees gave little indication during the matinee that they were interested in playing October baseball that had no grave consequences.It began with the lineup that Girardi sent out: Jose Pirela in right field, Austin Romine at first base and Chris Young batting cleanup. It continued with mental mistakes: Brendan Ryan was easily thrown out trying to race from first to third on a Brett Gardner single to left-center in the third inning, and the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Gerardo Parra, who had four hits and three R.B.I., got such a jump in the bottom of the third that he stole third base without a throw.

With the Orioles leading, 1-0, Young tripled to lead off the second, and the Yankees were in good position to draw even.

He challenged a call that Chris Davis had been hit by a pitch in the seventh inning; the call was overturned, sending a runner back to third and depriving the Orioles of a 10th run.Girardi said before the game that he was interested in making certain that the wild-card playoff would be in the Bronx, but there were other interests, too.

Privacy Policy    In declaring that no regulars who started the first game, including Rodriguez, the designated hitter, would start the second game, Girardi said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe one thing that\xe2\x80\x99s probably more important than home-field advantage is probably the health of our players, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to risk that.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Another calculation was to start Ivan Nova in the opener and hold Luis Severino for the second game. Girardi hoped that if the Yankees had won the first game, they could preserve Severino in case the wild-card game went into extra innings.But that plan quickly unraveled. Nova gave up eight hits and five runs and walked three in five and two-thirds innings, and it might have been far worse had a frigid day not turned two deep drives by Steve Pearce into warning-track outs rather than three-run homers.

He returned from Tommy John surgery on June 24 with a flourish, holding Philadelphia to three hits in six and two-thirds scoreless innings, but he was dropped from the rotation in early September after being pounded by Toronto. When Nathan Eovaldi was hurt, he regained his spot but not any semblance of consistency.

I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pitch the way I would like to pitch.\xe2\x80\x9dHis health, he said, was the only positive thing. He is 6-11 with an E.R.A. of 5.07.Severino also endured a rare rocky start. Nolan Reimold belted Severino\xe2\x80\x99s second pitch for a home run to left field, and Pearce doubled in Davis, who had been hit by a pitch. But Severino settled in after that, allowing five hits in seven innings, although one was a solo shot by Manny Machado in the third, his 35th home run of the season. Both of the home runs Severino allowed were on fastballs.

McCann, once ahead by 3-0 in the count, hit a fly ball to center.The missed opportunity proved costly when Janish led off the eighth with a bloop single to right, just out of the reach of the diving second baseman Rob Refsnyder. Janish advanced to second on a wild pitch, and after Betances struck out Reimold, Parra dropped a bunt down the third-base line against a shift, which let Janish advance to third. When Betances uncorked a fastball that went to the backstop, Janish scored. It was the first run Betances had given up against the Orioles since Aug. 13, 2014, a span of 13\xe2\x85\x94 innings.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles in game #162 of the season looked like the Orioles team that we expected to see finish 2015 with another American League East title and playoffs run. It had many of the elements we anticipated: Chris Tillman as the winning starter, Chris Davis hitting two homers, Matt Wieters and J.J. Hardy contributing in a big way with two hits each, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day setting up Zach Britton to close the door, etc.But this sort of story simply did not happen in enough games in 2015 for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to repeat. As many times as we saw a good game, we would see the offense fall asleep or starters not go deep enough and dig a hole too large to come out of. Literally, it was a 50/50 experience, yielding a final record of 81-81.But there was pleasure to be found in seeing the Orioles win their final five games and sweeping the accursed Yankees. Speaking of the NYY, they do not look like a team that is at all ready for the playoffs.This 2015 Orioles season reminds me of a trip I took many years ago, long before GPS sorts of navigation systems. I was in the mountains of West Virginia and wanted to get to Interstate 81. I was sure my sense of direction would take me southeast to where I would eventually run into the highway. About two hours later I found myself driving back into the same town from which I had originally departed!It was a strange journey for these Birds. The lineup on this final day did not look very much like that of opening day. Chris Tillman was the starter for each, and Manny Machado was at third base \xe2\x80\x94 playing every game of the season as the only MLB player to do such in 2015. Ryan Flaherty and Steve Pearce were in both lineups, but playing in different positions. Travis Snider, Alejandro De Aza, and Delmon Young were starters, and Tommy Hunter pitched in relief.Along the way of the circuitous ride the Orioles have taken over these past six months, a total of 48 players made appearances: 26 position players and 22 pitchers.Chris Davis put on a show in his final two at-bats, feared by many to be the last of his Baltimore career. Each was a classic Davis dinger: an opposite field fly that demonstrates his great strength, and a ball met in front of the plate and pulled high and deep onto the flag court.Davis, between the 2013 and 2015 campaigns hit exactly 100 homers \xe2\x80\x94 53 and 47 respectively. In his other three seasons with the O\xe2\x80\x99s he hit a total of 61.\xc2\xa0 That will be so difficult to replace, and really, the Orioles need to make every effort to keep him here.

He entered the game only one ahead of Nelson Cruz. I looked into Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s game with the A\xe2\x80\x99s early on to see how Cruz was doing and noticed him missing from the lineup. A little research revealed that he was out with a groin injury that has been plaguing him. He did finish the season at .302, along with his 44 home runs. But can he do that three more years and justify the contract?So now we begin a time of reviews, grades, postmortems, etc\xe2\x80\xa6 to be followed by all the offseason news and analyses of what to do moving forward. I honestly like the offseason and its intrigue, but nothing beats a real baseball game. Frankly, it is already too cold and I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to spring!So stick with us throughout the offseason here at The Baltimore Wire. As you likely understand, we don\xe2\x80\x99t break news, but we give early opinion and analysis upon it.
