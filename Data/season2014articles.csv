Every time, Verlander has helped pitch them into the American League Championship Series.Yet in all those years, the Tigers have won just one World Series game, in 2006. Verlander, 31, is signed through 2019 and can afford to take the long view. The lack of a title does not pain him.\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I wait a few more years, next thing you know I\xe2\x80\x99m 36 and came close to it a bunch of times and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite able to get it, then I think it would start to feel like more of a void.

The Tigers traded the reliable starter Doug Fister to Washington for a package led by Robbie Ray, a pitcher with just 11 games above Class A. They unloaded their expensive first baseman, Prince Fielder, to Texas for second baseman Ian Kinsler, who has hit .242 away from the Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 cozy ballpark.

Of course. They have three aces, including Anibal Sanchez, and the game\xe2\x80\x99s best hitter in Miguel Cabrera, who just signed a contract through 2023. But they have lost shortstop Jose Iglesias and reliever Bruce Rondon to season-ending injuries, and two of their most important players, outfielder Torii Hunter and closer Joe Nathan, will be 39 by the end of the All-Star break. Improved Royals Are LurkingIn the Central Division, the Tigers will have all they can handle from the Kansas City Royals, who went 86-76 last season, their best record since 1994. The Royals should reach base more often, with Norichika Aoki and Omar Infante added at the top of the order, and the rookie Yordano Ventura could have a major effect on the rotation.

But remember that the Royals went 43-27 in the second half, essentially matching the Tigers (43-27) and the Cleveland Indians (41-26).

But he went 11-14 otherwise, mainly because of atrocious defense and the A.L.\xe2\x80\x99s worst offense. The Cuban first baseman Jose Abreu addresses the defense, and Adam Eaton \xe2\x80\x94 who goes by Spanky \xe2\x80\x94 takes over in center after a trade with Arizona.Already Hurting in the WestIn the West, the Los Angeles Angels survived spring training in better shape than the reigning champions, the Oakland Athletics, who lost starter Jarrod Parker for the season after reconstructive elbow surgery.The Texas Rangers have been ravaged by recent injuries, losing second baseman Jurickson Profar (shoulder) and catcher Geovany Soto (knee) for at least 10 weeks each. Starter Derek Holland needed knee surgery in January after his dog tripped him on the stairs; he may miss half the season.

But do not be surprised if the Baltimore Orioles turn out to be the best team in the league. In an era of declining offense, their overpowering lineup is a difference maker.Three A.L. teams scored more runs last season than Baltimore: the division-winning Red Sox, the Tigers and the Athletics. The Orioles led the majors in home runs by far, and now they add the All-Star Nelson Cruz to the middle of their order.

Puskar/Associated Press           Cruz was suspended last summer as part of the Biogenesis doping investigation. But his addition gives Baltimore five everyday players who hit at least 22 homers last season.

East. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers may not measure up to the rest of the division on the surface, but five everyday players have won Gold Gloves in the last three seasons. Manager Buck Showalter and the pitching coach, Dave Wallace, are skilled at manipulating pitchers\xe2\x80\x99 roles.The Orioles have five solid starters, led by Ubaldo Jimenez. But they also have two elite prospects \xe2\x80\x94 Dylan Bundy (recovering from Tommy John elbow surgery) and Kevin Gausman \xe2\x80\x94 who could contribute this season. If Johan Santana has anything left in his surgically repaired shoulder, the Orioles will get it. Suk-min Yoon, a right-hander signed from South Korea, may also help.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles are far from perfect. Third baseman Manny Machado, who led the league in doubles and defensive wins above replacement (as calculated by baseball-reference.com), will miss the start of the season while recovering from knee surgery. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s long-term outlook is clouded by the service time of Davis and catcher Matt Wieters, who are both clients of the agent Scott Boras and can be free agents after the 2015 season.Like many teams, then, the Orioles are squarely in a win-now stretch. Their A.L. neighbors Tampa Bay, New York, Texas, Detroit and Boston have reached the World Series within the last six years. Although some of those teams may have peaked, the Orioles and their prime-age core could be better than what we have recently seen.\xe2\x80\x9cEver since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of guys at the same stage of their careers, the same age, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to keep a lot of us together,\xe2\x80\x9d Wieters said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very rare to have so many guys from 25 to 31 on the team. More than anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice for all the players because we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through very similar stages in our career.\xe2\x80\x9dNow they have a better chance than you might think to reach the brightest stage in baseball, a place not visited by the Orioles in 31 years: the World Series.

Those signings turned the Orioles from off season losers to big time winners. Whereas previously the story of the off season was the Grant Balfour situation, afterwards it turned into how much beefier the rotation looked, and how much more opponents might now fear the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 already potent lineup with the likes of Nelson Cruz. But will this translate to wins and losses on the field?If you\xe2\x80\x99re going for overall wins and losses, Nelson Cruz \xc2\xa0had a WAR of 2.2 in 2013 and UbaldoCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsJimenez stood at 2.7. So doing some rough math, that\xe2\x80\x99s five wins that the Orioles picked up based on those signings \xe2\x80\x93 which would put the O\xe2\x80\x99s at 90 wins based on last season. Is that enough to make the post season? Let\xe2\x80\x99s not get ahead of ourselves, as we only now sit on the eve of Opening Day. However as has been the case in the past, the Orioles will sink or swim this season based on their pitching. Granted it begins with starting pitching, however it also dips into the bullpen as well.The O\xe2\x80\x99s of course traded closer Jim Johnson to Oakland, and Tommy Hunter is going to be the primary closer. Questions about the bullpen will linger throughout the first few weeks of the season, or until the \xe2\x80\x98pen proves that it can mow down opposing batters. With that said, the success and/or failure of the 2014 season might well lie in one-run games. In 2012 (a playoff year) the Birds were an amazing 29-9 in one run games. Last season (where they just missed qualifying for the post season) they were 10-21 \xe2\x80\x93 do the math. In a division like the AL East, those one run games will be a huge deciding factor. That in and of itself is why the performance of the aforementioned Hunter, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Zach Britton, Brian Matusz, et al, is of great importance.However wins and losses often begin and end with starting pitching. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 rotation looksCourtesy of Douglas Jones-USA TODAY Sportsmuch different than even five years ago, when it was anchored on Opening Day by Kevin Millwood. However with the addition of the aforementioned Jimenez, the Birds now have two bona fide ace-type pitchers at the front of the rotation. And when you throw in Wei-Yin Chen, Miguel Gonzalez, and Bud Norris, the O\xe2\x80\x99s appear to be in decent shape top-to-bottom in terms of their starters. This of course presumes that the likes of Tillman and company produce what they have in the past, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to think that they won\xe2\x80\x99t. (Incidentally that\xe2\x80\x99s true of every team in the league; if Derek Jeter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t produce as he has in the past he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to have a good season.) However the key for the starters is once again going to be going deeper into games; if the bullpen has to pick up the slack for half of games down the stretch, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a long season and someone\xe2\x80\x99s arm might fall off.The least of most people\xe2\x80\x99s concerns is offense and the defense behind the starting pitchers. The Orioles have a potent offensive lineup with the likes of Adam Jones, Nick Markakis, Nelson Cruz, and of course Chris Davis. Defensively the Orioles had a historically good year in 2013, and again there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to think that trend won\xe2\x80\x99t continue. However the wild card of course is the fact that Manny Machado will start the season on the DL. When he returns, will he be up to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to expect? That of course remains to be seen, however I suspect that Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette won\xe2\x80\x99t rush Machado back, especially knowing that second and third base are in good hands with Ryan Flaherty and Steve Lombardozzi.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 25-man roster has been finalized, and I suppose the big news is that JonathanCourtesy of Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY SportsSchoop not only made the team, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance he might be in the Opening Day lineup. Speaking for myself, this was almost a formality, as based on his performance I felt that they had no choice but to bring him north. T.J. McFarland was also optioned to Norfolk yesterday, along with Jermile Weeks and Kevin Gausman. All of them are still on the 40-man roster, so they could be in Baltimore at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. Even Meeks will probably get the slot McFarland filled in terms of being the long man in the \xe2\x80\x98pen moving forward.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are once again poised to contend for a playoff spot in 2014. So where do they finish, and with how many wins? It really matters who you ask; Vegas says forth place and 78 wins. However CBS\xe2\x80\x99 Jon Heyman predicted the Orioles to finish first in the AL East for the first time since 1997. Ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that neither the Orioles or anyone else is going to finish 162-0 \xe2\x80\x93 or 0-162 for that matter. I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking\xe2\x80\xa6REALLY Vadala, you\xe2\x80\x99re predicting them to finish somewhere between 162-0 and 0-162?!\xc2\xa0Something like that, I suppose. However let\xe2\x80\x99s be a bit more specific. I think that Chris Tillman will continue his progression, and become the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first twenty-game winner in years. Will Chris Davis hit another 53 homers? Probably not, however the O\xe2\x80\x99s will now also have another 25-30 homers built into their lineup with the likes of Nelson Cruz. So what\xe2\x80\x99s my prediction in terms of wins and losses? I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do this because I\xe2\x80\x99m not big on taking risks \xe2\x80\x93 but count me as being in the Jon Heyman camp\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with somewhere in the neighborhood of 90 wins.

Encina, The Baltimore SunTAMPA, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 Even though the Orioles have made plans to honor late public relations director Monica Barlow as part of a pregame ceremony on Opening Day, players would like to have another way to remember Barlow on the field throughout the season.That\xe2\x80\x99s not the easiest thing to do, because Major League Baseball has strict uniform regulations that prevent players from making alterations to uniforms on their own.The Orioles will honor Barlow \xe2\x80\x94 as well as team investor and Baltimore-born novelist Tom Clancy, former Gold Glove outfielder Paul Blair and 10 other members of the Orioles family who passed away since last Opening Day \xe2\x80\x94 during a pregame video tribute Monday before the Orioles play their season opener against the Boston Red Sox.Barlow died Feb. 28 after a nearly four-and-a-half\xe2\x80\x93year battle with lung cancer at age 36.But Orioles first baseman Chris Davis said this past week that Barlow meant so much to them as players that they have discussed ways to carry her memory onto the field with them during every game. var adSkipCounter = 0; \xe2\x80\x9cI think that\xe2\x80\x99s the big reason we wanted to and still want to do something to honor her on the field,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cAside from the way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to play and the way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to remember her in that aspect, I feel like the guys in here, despite what Major League Baseball says, want to do something to honor her. It means a lot.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are so many people in this circle who people don\xe2\x80\x99t really see because they\xe2\x80\x99re not on the field wearing the uniforms, but they\xe2\x80\x99re just as important \xe2\x80\x94 if not more important \xe2\x80\x94 than we are. It\xe2\x80\x99s just an honor to the job she did, but what kind of person she is. ... I know we have rules to follow. Hopefully, we can get together and do something to honor her. I think that would be fitting.\xe2\x80\x9dPlayers who alter their uniform in any way are subject to one equipment violation warning and\xc2\xa0 subsequent fines. The Orioles will wear a patch to honor Clancy on their jersey sleeve,\xc2\xa0a request that\xc2\xa0was approved by MLB.MLB spokesman Pat Courtney said that uniform rules were created because players began putting random messages and flags on caps.Courtney added that MLB offices have not received any additional request to honor Barlow in a certain way, but added that MLB is \xe2\x80\x9cmore than willing to speak with the Orioles about any idea they have.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cWe all have noticed and have been really impressed with the extent the Orioles want to honor Monica,\xe2\x80\x9d Courtney added.Davis said he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken with fellow veterans Adam Jones and Matt Wieters about possible ways to honor Barlow. They talked about putting up a plaque in the clubhouse, but a limited number of people ever have access to that area.During their first home spring training game March 1, several Orioles players wore gray wristbands with Barlow\xe2\x80\x99s initials on them. The team also wore orange T-shirts with the logo of Lungevity -- a nonprofit organization working to increase lung cancer awareness that Barlow worked closely with -- with the words \xe2\x80\x9cIn Memory of Monica\xe2\x80\x9d during batting practice of both games of a split-squad doubleheader this spring.One idea being considered is making a jersey with Barlow\xe2\x80\x99s name on it to hang in the dugout during games, much like the Red Sox did last year with a \xe2\x80\x9cBoston Strong 617\xe2\x80\x9d jersey following the Boston Marathon bombings.Courtney said that could work. The team wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need MLB permission to make a jersey.\xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion, that would be something I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the plaque, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen regardless, but I think it would be cool for other people to know not only how big of an impact she had on us but how much we\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about her.\xe2\x80\x9cOnce we get out there [to Baltimore] and get settled we will try to get something done,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis added. \xe2\x80\x9cAll this stuff that\xe2\x80\x99s being talked about, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that she would have been very much against.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Grady Sizemore will never forget his first opening day with the Boston Red Sox.His teammates, however, can\'t wait to put the memory of the game behind them.The defending World Series champion Red Sox failed to capitalize on several scoring opportunities, and a home run by Sizemore wasn\'t enough to prevent a 2-1 loss to the Baltimore Orioles on Monday.After missing two seasons recovering from knee surgery, Sizemore marked his return from a 922-day absence with a second-inning single for his first hit since September 2011. The three-time All-Star for Cleveland later hit his first homer since July 15, 2011, which also came at Camden Yards.""Today was very exciting,"" Sizemore said. ""I couldn\'t wait to get to the ballpark.""The single was particularly gratifying, because it came on his first at-bat.""Having gone through what I\'ve gone through, it was nice to get that moment,"" Sizemore said.His homer created a 1-1 tie in the fourth inning, but that would be the extent of the Boston offense. The Red Sox got nine hits and drew three walks, but they stranded 12 and went 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position.""There were a lot of opportunities that we did create but didn\'t cash in,"" manager John Farrell said. ""The two-out hit was elusive.""Second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who went 2 for 5, added, ""We just hit the ball right at people. It was one of those deals where we couldn\'t find a way to push runs across.""Nelson Cruz homered off Jon Lester (0-1) in the seventh inning to put the Orioles up 2-1. Cruz hit 27 homers last year with Texas during a season marred by a 50-game suspension from Major League Baseball in the Biogenesis drug scandal.""It was really neat, it was special,"" he said. ""I made the right call to come and be part of this organization, be part of this town.""Zach Britton (1-0) got the win with two scoreless innings of relief and Tommy Hunter got three outs for the save. Hunter earned the job as closer this spring after the Orioles dealt away Jim Johnson during the offseason.The Red Sox got two on with one out in the ninth before World Series MVP David Ortiz hit a flyball and Jackie Bradley Jr. took a called third strike.Making his fourth straight opening day start for Boston, Lester gave up two runs, six hits and a walk in seven innings. He struck out eight.""It was good. Obviously, the only thing better would be if we win,"" the left-hander said. ""Other than that I thought I threw the ball well.""Orioles starter Chris Tillman allowed one run, seven hits and a walk in five innings. The right-hander went 3-1 against Boston last year, but in this one he needed 104 pitches to get 15 outs.Britton gave up a one-out double to Xander Bogaerts in the sixth and got three straight outs in the seventh, the only time all day that Boston went down in order.Evan Meek walked two in the eighth before Brian Matusz retired A.J. Pierzynski on a comebacker.Gametime temperature was announced at 60 degrees, but a stiff wind chilled many in the crowd of 46,685 \xe2\x80\x94 the 23rd consecutive opening day sellout at Camden Yards.Hopeful that the offseason acquisitions of Cruz and right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez will enable Baltimore to return to the playoffs after missing out last year, Orioles fans were out in force. Until recently, games against Boston often drew as many Red Sox backers as those rooting for the home team.""Our crowd was legit,"" Hunter said. ""That was awesome. I hope they come out like that every game for 80 more here.""The Orioles used a walk, a single by Matt Wieters and a double-play grounder to take a 1-0 lead in the second.The Red Sox put runners at second and third with two outs in the third before Tillman struck out Mike Carp. In the fourth, Sizemore hit a 3-1 pitch over the right field wall.NOTES: Pedroia got Boston\'s first hit of the season, a one-out single in the first inning, to extend his hitting streak on opening day to eight games. ...

When Ripken began his consecutive games streak on May 30, 1982, I was three years old. I may have not even been aware that baseball was a thing. And when his streak came to an end on September 20, 1998, I was a sophomore in college. I was 19 years old before I ever saw an Orioles game without Cal Ripken. It\'s crazy, if you think about it. Yes, Ripken\'s streak of 2,632 consecutive games is the thing that he is remembered most for in his Hall of Fame career. By the end it had grown into something uncontrollable, I think. But Ripken never intended for it to start in the first place. He was just a really, really good baseball player. The kind that any manager would want in the lineup every single day. Ripken was drafted in the second round of the 1978 amateur draft by the Orioles. The Orioles had two picks before they got to him. In the first round they drafted someone named Robert Boyce, a third baseman who never made it past A ball. Earlier in the second round, they drafted Larry Sheets. The draft is a funny thing. The first part of Ripken\'s career was rather charmed. He was called up in August 1981 after a strike by MLB came to an end, and played on a team that came within one game of going to the playoffs. Then in 1982 the Orioles won 94 games, Ripken took home Rookie of the Year honors, and they again fell just one game short of the playoffs. And in his third year, 1983, the Orioles won the World Series and Ripken was named A.L. Most Valuable Player. He must have thought that baseball was always going to be like that, winning awards and playing every season with the postseason on the line.    It wasn\'t, of course. As the Orioles went from perennial contender to basement dwellers in the 1980s, Cal Ripken continued on as one of the best players in baseball. From 1984-1991 the Orioles finished above fourth place just once (the miracle 1989 season), but it wasn\'t because of Cal. In those five seasons he hit .277/.352/.462 and became something rarely seen in baseball at that time: a power-hitting shortstop. In his first ten years in baseball he hit 259 home runs and 340 doubles, and in 1991 he put up one of the best seasons in Orioles history, and easily the best year of his career.    Maybe Cal wanted to send Memorial Stadium out in style, since 1991 was the last year of the old ballpark. In addition to playing the absolutely stellar defense that he put up his entire career, Cal hit had 210 hits on the year including 34 home runs and 46 doubles. So good was his all-around play that he was voted the league MVP despite the fact that his team won just 67 games. As you\'re probably aware, that hardly ever happens. But there was just no denying his amazing season. In addition to the MVP he was awarded the Gold Glove and the Silver Slugger. FanGraphs calculates that Cal\'s 1991 season was worth 10.6 WAR, the highest single season total in Orioles history (The top three seasons all belong to Cal). Despite being one of the best defensive shortstops in baseball, the 1991 Gold Glove was the first awarded to Ripken in his career. Other shortstops were flashier, diving all over the field and thus outshined Cal in the voting. But those who watched him every day knew exactly how good he was on defense. At 6\'4"" and 200+ pounds, it wasn\'t Cal\'s style to make a lot of dives. He didn\'t need to anyway, because he knew so much about every hitter on other teams and about every pitcher on his team that he was almost always perfectly positioned if the ball was hit his way. It\'s easy for your defense to go unheralded when every play you make looks like an easy ground ball. And his arm was so strong that he could play deep in the hole if needed and still make a strong throw to first base.    It turned out that 1991 was kind of Cal\'s swan song as far as offense goes. He continued to get on base at a decent clip but his power began to wane as he played into his thirties. Could it be that playing every single day sapped his strength? Who knows. But even with a less prolific bat, Cal was still a very valuable player thanks to the high level of defense he played. In 1996, Cal was back in the playoffs for the first time since he caught the last out of the 1983 World Series. He was on fire in the ALDS against the Cleveland Indians, going 8-for-18 with three doubles. He was less productive in the ALCS, although he did have two two-hit games. In 1997 he was hot for the duration of the playoffs, despite a below average showing at the plate in the regular season. He went 7-for-16 with two doubles and two walks in the ALDS against Seattle, and in the ALCS against Cleveland he had eight hits, including two doubles and a home run, and he walked four times. Sadly for both Cal and for all of us Orioles fans, he couldn\'t hit the team into the World Series. As is true with so many baseball players, Cal Ripken probably should have retired a few seasons earlier than he did. He lasted until 2001 in an Orioles uniform. His last game at Camden Yards was supposed to be September 23, 2001, but on account of the terrorist attacks the schedule had to be rearranged and he actually played his last home game on October 6th. I was at the game on September 23rd, having spent more money than I could afford on the tickets when I thought it was my last chance to see him. The Orioles were a mess in 2001, but Cal sent the crowd home happy with the very last home run of his career (#431, if you\'re counting). On his actual last day, he went 0-for-3 and the game ended with him on deck.    Baseball has never seen a player quite like Cal Ripken, and probably never will again. He played in 2,632 consecutive games, shattering the previously held record of 2,130. He went to 19 straight All Star games, 16 of which he was elected into by the fans. He won two MVPs, eight Silver Sluggers, and one Rookie of the Year Award. His final season was celebrated by all of baseball as every team he visited gave him going away presents and opposing crowds gave standing ovations. He was elected into the Orioles Hall of Fame in 2003 and the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame in in 2007 with 98.5% of the vote. He is one of the greatest shortstops in baseball history and the #1 Oriole of all time.

That said, if you have a suggestion for what you\'d like to see in future preview articles, leave us a note in the comments! We appreciate the feedback. Monday, 31 March: Chris Tillman vs. Jon Lester    2013 Stats Tillman Lester   IP 206.1 213.1   ERA 3.71 3.75   FIP 4.42 3.59   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .241/.303/.427 .253/.314/.389     Chris Tillman gets the Opening Day nod for the 2014 season after putting together a very good 2013. While his .269 BABIP and 80.5% strand rate are likely not sustainable, Tillman has also managed to increase his strikeout rate over the last few years: 16.0% in \'11, 19.0% in \'12, and 21.2% in \'13. The league-average strikeout rate in 2013 was 19.9%. If Tillman\'s improvement in that regard holds - and it\'ll need to if he\'s to have the kind of results he did last year - the O\'s just might have a reliable starter with an above-average strikeout rate, something they\'ve sorely lacked for the last several years.    Lester is all too familiar to Baltimore fans, as he\'s thrown over 150 career innings against the Orioles while keeping his ERA under three. He throws four- and two-seam fastballs about half of the time, with cutters making up another quarter or so of his pitches, and the remainder are mostly curveballs and the occasional changeup. The cutter and curve see a lot more use when he\'s ahead in the count or has two strikes, while the changeup is just there to keep righties guessing.    Maybe hot: Nelson Cruz (1.409 OPS, 24 PA), Shane Victorino (1.053 OPS, 12 PA) Likely not: Chris Davis (.526 OPS, 26 PA), David Ortiz (.313 OPS, 20 PA)    Wednesday, 2 April: Ubaldo Jimenez vs. John Lackey    2013 Stats Jimenez Lackey   IP 182.2 189.1   ERA 3.30 3.52   FIP 3.43 3.86   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .239/.317/.367 .247/.290/.413     Jimenez is certainly going to be interesting to watch over the course of his contract. Hopefully, it won\'t be ""interesting"" in this sense. Rather than rehashing the many articles discussing Jimenez\'s rocky career, let\'s take a look at the new Oriole\'s repertoire. Jimenez is mostly a fastball-splitter guy, though he started throwing his slider a lot more in 2013. There\'s a good chance he tries to continue that going forward, since it may have contributed to his renewed success last year. He likes to use his sinker early in the count or when behind, but saves his four-seam fastball for when he\'s ahead or has two strikes. He\'ll also throw first-pitch sliders to righties nearly half of the time, while generally saving the splitter for lefties, against whom he\'ll throw it in any count. Lackey came back after losing 2012 to injury and had a solid season for Boston in 2013, posting a career-low walk rate and his highest strikeout rate since 2006. He\'s a fastball pitcher first and foremost, throwing four-seamers roughly half of the time. Against righties, he rarely uses anything except the fastball or his slider, while he mixes in a curve more often against lefties.    Maybe hot: Chris Davis (1.073 OPS, 32 PA), Jonny Gomes (1.417 OPS, 14 PA) Likely not: Matt Wieters (.333 OPS, 30 PA) Thursday, 3 April: Felix Doubront vs. Wei-Yin Chen    2013 Stats Chen Doubront   IP 137.0 162.1   ERA 4.07 4.32   FIP 4.04 3.78   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .272/.321/.440 .261/.338/.391     Chen lost some time to injury last season, but otherwise was pretty similar to the 2012 version: an average starter with modest strikeout rates, good control, and flyball tendencies that he usually gets away with. He did manage to cut down on his homer rate in \'13 (11.7 -> 9.9 HR/FB%), despite allowing even more flyballs (37.1 -> 34.4 GB%). Chen isn\'t flashy, but is a steal for the O\'s so far, as he\'s making just over $4M this year and could be an Oriole again next year for $4.75M. Ideally, sure, he\'s not your #3 starter, but young, competent, cost-controlled pitching is valuable, regardless of whether the guy\'s a home-grown prospect or an international free agent. I always forget about Doubront when thinking about Boston\'s pitching, even though he\'s started more than fifty games for them over the past two seasons. Like Lackey, he throws four-seam fastballs about half of the time, especially on the first pitch of an at-bat or when behind in the count.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThere is only one explanation as to how it can snow one day at the end of March with a howling cold wind, and then turn to the mid 60s the next day. Yes, the opening day of baseball season \xe2\x80\x93 the best day of the year.Some people actually like winter and cold and snow and ice. I know it is true, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll never understand it. As a child, I remember the first warmer days of spring and taking my baseball glove to school as the revival of hope that, yes, I was no longer locked up in a house! If you think about it, any weather that prevents playing baseball is bad weather! (Although truthfully, some of the coldest days of my life have been on a baseball field early in the season. I remember pitching in a college game in northern Pennsylvania and being unable to see my right fielder for several minutes \xe2\x80\x93 since he was completely engulfed in a white-out snow squall!)Yes, spring is a season of hope and new life. Everyone begins with a record of 0-0 and all things seem possible. And with the Baltimore Orioles opening day, hopes are renewed again. Is it reasonable to have hope? I certainly think so. Could the Orioles actually win the AL East? Yes, it is possible, even if we admit that it is a tough thing to do in the best division in the game. Could they finish dead last in the AL East? I suppose it is possible, though less likely than the former \xe2\x80\x93 but maybe so many things could go wrong that it happens.But hope is reasonable, no matter what the naysayers and alleged baseball experts around the country write about the Orioles. Dissing the Birds is an annual rite of spring \xe2\x80\x93 almost like sightings of the first robins in the yard. It will happen.From just two years ago this week, at the beginning of a season where the Orioles finished 93-69, here are three samples of well-known baseball prognosticators\xe2\x80\x99 pre-season writings about that Baltimore team \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Orioles are such a bungled mess that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t called them anything other than the OriLOLes for months.\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Orioles are still a directionless team with less-than-competent management and a meddling owner.

It\xe2\x80\x99ll be at least a decade before they are able to come out.Can you believe that? These are guys who got paid to write that stuff. So, after two very good seasons, it is certainly reasonable to at least project the Orioles as a serious contender, in spite of the continuous drivel about the weakness of the starting rotation.Let me put it this way for you. There is no doubt that this 2013 team is an upgrade over the past two years. If we take the last 350 regular season games from the end of August of 2011 to the end of last year, here would be the results \xe2\x80\xa6Tampa Bay\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 198-152New York\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 194-156Baltimore\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 192-158Boston\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 173-177Toronto\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 160-190That is encouraging, and it is not something most baseball fans would expect to see \xe2\x80\x93 particularly that the New York Yankees have only won two more games than the Orioles over the past 350 regular season contests.As more proof as to how far the Orioles have come, let\xe2\x80\x99s compare this year\xe2\x80\x99s opening lineup with that of just four years ago in 2010 (I have to take a guess on the exact lineup at the time that I write this).Position20102014PitcherKevin MillwoodChris TillmanCatcherMatt WietersMatt WietersFirst BaseGarrett AtkinsChris DavisSecond BaseBrian RobertsJonathan SchoopThird BaseMiguel TejadaRyan FlahertyShortstopCesar IzturisJ.J.

Schoop would be the first rookie second baseman for the Orioles since Rich Dauer in 1977, and the youngest rookie starting the opener since some guy wearing #8 started at shortstop in 1982.Lester is 15-3 lifetime against the Orioles, though the Birds got to him pretty good last year. And Nelson Cruz is 10-for-22 with two homers against him. Delmon Young is only 7-for-34 with no extra-base hits, and Steve Pearce is 1-for-8 \xe2\x80\xa6 so yes, Lester is tough.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('2014 Bowie Baysox season preview - Camden Chat', ' The Bowie Baysox went 71-71 in 2013, with Mike Wright leading the pitching staff, Eduardo Rodriguez seeing a mid-season promotion from the Keys, and Kevin Gausman, Eddie Gamboa, and Henry Urrutia graduating to Norfolk and/or the majors. As is common for the Orioles\' farm teams, the 2014 roster features more interesting pitchers than hitters, but we\'ll take a brief look at both. Pitchers Eduardo Rodriguez (SP): Rodriguez isn\'t in the same tier as Gausman or Dylan Bundy, but he\'s been  placed as the next-best prospect for the O\'s on most lists this offseason. In 2013, after making fourteen starts with a 2.85 ERA in Frederick, he was promoted to Bowie and pitched for another eight starts, posting a less impressive 4.22 ERA but striking out 59 batters in 59.2 innings. Rodriguez is in his age 21 season now, so the lefty is young for AA. That makes some bumps in the road (like last night) inevitable, but he has an above-average fastball already, potential for above-average offspeed pitches, and a lot of time on his side. Depending on how he progresses, we could see Rodriguez in Baltimore before the season closes. Dylan Bundy (SP): After losing the 2013 season to Tommy John surgery, Bundy is on the disabled list to start the season, but hopes to get back to game action in June, if not earlier.  It\'s a testament to his tremendous ability that despite the injury and Gausman\'s promising MLB debut, he\'s still rated number one on some O\'s prospect lists. If his rehab continues to go well, and if he picks up right where he left off stuff- and command-wise, Bundy could even see time with the O\'s down the stretch. Tim Berry (SP): Berry\'s a lefty who\'s gotten a nice boost in his prospect ranking thanks more to positive scouting reports than improved minor league numbers. He started 27 games in Frederick last year with similar strikeout and walk rates to what he posted in 2012, but was significantly less hittable, throwing 23.1 more innings but allowing just six more hits. Hopefully, that\'s a result of improving stuff and command, rather than just luck. Berry has an average fastball and potentially plus curve, but needs to continue developing his changeup to have more success against right-handed batters.    Zach Davies (SP): Davies comes in below Berry on most prospect lists, but has a similar ceiling, as a number four starter. He likely ranks lower because, listed at six feet tall and 150 pounds, he\'s considered undersized. (Six feet tall is undersized? Baseball is funny.) Davies is just two months older than Rodriguez and thus is also young for AA, but he\'s shown tremendous improvement over his two minor league seasons (\'12, low-A: 7.2 K/9, 3.6 BB/9, 0.9 HR/9; \'13, high-A: 8.0 K/9, 2.3 BB/9, 0.6 HR/9) to justify a promotion each year. Davies features a classic four-pitch mix with only an average fastball, but reportedly induces lots of groundballs and has good command and pitchability. Hitters  Michael Ohlman (C): Ohlman broke out in a big way last year, posting a .313/.410/.524 batting line with Frederick in 2013 after hinting at improvement in 2012. At 6\'5"", the same height as Matt Wieters, Ohlman is quite tall for a catcher, and unsurprisingly, there are some questions about his ability to stick at the position. Most reports buy into his bat, though, so he needs to continue to hit while polishing his defensive skillset at catcher. It\'s a tall order, but this year could be a big one not just for Ohlman, but for the Orioles: another solid year could make the O\'s much more comfortable with letting Wieters walk after the 2015 season. Honorable Mentions Dariel Alvarez (OF): Alvarez was signed out of Cuba in July of last year and played just 22 games, hitting well enough to get promotions from the Gulf Coast League to Frederick and finally Bowie. He hasn\'t ranked high enough on any prospect lists to get a lot of scouting info, but he\'s one of the more interesting Bowie bats nonetheless.    Christian Walker (1B): Walker advanced rapidly in 2013, moving from Delmarva to Frederick to Bowie. The second promotion was probably a bit aggressive, and his power fell off at AA, but he\'s just old enough (23 now) that the O\'s probably felt the need to push him a bit. He looks like a so-called AAAA player, a too-common fate of already-polished college products, but Camden Depot sees a little more potential than most. Buck Britton (2B), Bobby Bundy (SP), and Sharlon Schoop (SS): Each of these three is the older brother of a guy who\'s made it to the Orioles. That\'s pretty cool, but since none rate on prospect lists these days, I imagine the situation is rather bittersweet for them.

Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0NOT\xc2\xa0time to press the panic button if you\xe2\x80\x99re following this team. Keep in mind that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even gone the entire way through the rotation, and the Orioles ran into some great pitching in Lackey and Felix Doubront in games two and three. Is 1-2 ideal? Not in the least, however\xe2\x80\xa6three games out of 162 is nothing.The biggest hole last night was the same thing that befell the Birds the previous night: starting pitching. Let me be clear; Wei-Yin Chen wasn\xe2\x80\x99t horrible, and as Joe Angel and Fred Manfra said on WBAL\xe2\x80\x99s postgame show, he did put his team in a position to win the game. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.2 IP, 12 H, 4 R, 0 BB, 5 K. The good news is that Chen wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far off in terms of his pitches; if anything, he was hitting spots too well if such a concept exists. There was no movement on Chen\xe2\x80\x99s pitches last night, much like we saw with Ubaldo Jimenez the night before. Furthermore Boston\xe2\x80\x99s a stingy team at the plate, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll force you to throw the ball over in order for them to swing.Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsChen had runners at the corners after two base hits (and nobody out) in the second, but he was able to minimize the damage by inducing a double-play from Wil Middlebrooks. The Orioles gave up a run, however those are the kinds of things you have to do to keep your team in the game. David Ortiz added an RBI-single in the third inning and Ross one in the fourth, and suddenly the Orioles were 3-0 in the hole. However the O\xe2\x80\x99s still had some fight in them, as Chris Davis led off the last of the fourth with a double to center field, and he was later plated by Matt Wieter\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double. Wieters would score on Delmon Young\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single, and suddenly the O\xe2\x80\x99s only trailed by one run.\xc2\xa0Jackie Bradley Jr\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single in the sixth inning would put Boston back up by two, and Chris Davis would score with the bases loaded in the last of the inning on a wild pitch. The O\xe2\x80\x99s also threatened in the eighth, but to no avail.Again, the Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t far off in these games. Granted you\xe2\x80\x99d rather\xc2\xa0not be far off back in spring training as opposed to in the regular season against a division rival, however if pitchers can employ just a bit of late movement on the ball (as Chris Tillman was able to do on Monday) they\xe2\x80\x99ll find themselves in much better shape. I do think that it\xe2\x80\x99s noteworthy to mention how Chen minimized the damage early in the game in yielding that first run. There\xe2\x80\x99s a part of me that says\xc2\xa0you still gave up the run which means you have to score two to beat them. However part of why teams such as Boston are so good is because they set themselves up to have big innings. That second inning last night was starting to go in that direction, however Chen closed the door on that by giving up the one run and erasing the other base runners which removed the threat of a big inning (or at least would have forced Boston to start over in order to have one). Granted the O\xe2\x80\x99s ended up losing by the one run, however if Boston has a big inning there they aren\xe2\x80\x99t even in the game late.While the starting pitching has had a few issues and the bats have been asleep to a certain degree, the biggest bright spot for the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the first three games without a doubt has been the bullpen. Evan Meek and Zack Britton combined last night to pitch 3.1 innings, giving up one hit, one walk, and striking out two. Britton has probably been the \xe2\x80\x9cstar\xe2\x80\x9d if such a thing exists in the \xe2\x80\x98pen, and it seems that he\xe2\x80\x99s really found a home out there. Obviously the goal of every pitcher is to be in the starting rotation, however you can\xe2\x80\x99t underestimate the importance of a great shutdown reliever.Immediately following last night\xe2\x80\x99s game the O\xe2\x80\x99s hopped on their charter and flew to Detroit. There were some storms in the Detroit area overnight, and as of last night there appeared to be some question as to whether or not today\xe2\x80\x99s game would be played. However I checked the Detroit forecast prior to writing this article, and tentatively the forecast looks fairly clear for 1 PM today which is the scheduled start time. The Orioles were saying last night that if today\xe2\x80\x99s game ends up being rained out, they\xe2\x80\x99re expecting to play a day/night doubleheader on Saturday.Detroit has a pretty big advantage in that not only did the Orioles finish their game last night and have to fly to Detroit to prepare for an early 1 PM start, but the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 game with Kansas City was rained out yesterday giving them some extra rest. Granted we\xe2\x80\x99re at a point in the season when extra rest might not mean as much, but every little bit helps. Miguel Gonzalez will head to the bump for the Birds, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Anibal Sanchez. One thing to watch: in five games previously at Comerica Park, Chris Davis has five homers, eight hits, and ten RBI. Both he and the O\xe2\x80\x99s will hope that trend continues this afternoon and all weekend. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

The good news is that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offence finally came awake with five runs in the 9th inning; the bad news is that it was still a run short in a 7-6 loss to the Tigers.All the numbers surrounding the Baltimore Orioles right now are upside down. There is the 1-4 record. There is the lack of power, with only two homers so far, and those from newcomer Nelson Cruz. There is the consistent inability of starting pitchers to get past the 5th inning. And even with the opposition, Rick Porcello \xe2\x80\x93 notoriously poor in April and against the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 gets 20 outs for the Tigers while giving up only a run on three hits.A baseball purist would have to like quite a number of the small things done by the Detroit Tigers on Saturday.

Porcello threw one grounder after another. And even Alex Gonzalez contributed to the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 effort by getting on base with a single and walk and scoring both times.The five-run outburst in the 9th inning will hopefully awaken the Orioles offense, as it does illustrate that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are seldom ever completely out of a game. The need is for the pitching to hold them in the contest until the bats can tally the necessary runs. Unfortunately Brian Matusz allowed the two additional runs that proved to be the margin of difference. But the obvious need for the Orioles starters to pitch more effectively and deeper into games is \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 it is obvious.

Since playing defense was in essence a punishment in my eyes I thought that if I played poorly I\xe2\x80\x99d truly never get the chance to play forward, but then again if I did really well they\xe2\x80\x99d never move me out of the goal. Quite a dilema at times.So what\xe2\x80\x99s the point here in relation to the Baltimore Orioles? I look at guys like Brian Matusz and Zach Britton, and I see some similar characteristics. Granted they\xe2\x80\x99re both gifted athletes who train year-around, whereas I would balk at running laps around the field (see what I did there\xe2\x80\xa6balk?!). However both of them set out to be starting pitchers. In fact as I said on the Birds Watcher Radio Show yesterday, when he first came up I thought Matusz would be the next great power southpaw. However they\xe2\x80\x99ve both found homes in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve found that they\xe2\x80\x99re both very effective in those roles.Both players have expressed interest in starting at some point, however they also know thatCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sportsthere\xe2\x80\x99s probably not a place for them right now in the rotation. However again, they do find themselves in a bit of a catch-22. The better they pitch in relief, the more Buck Showalter will call them out of the pen \xe2\x80\x93 and thus the longer they could be in the bullpen. It\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for relievers not to be effective as starters \xe2\x80\x93 see Josh Stinson and T.J. McFarland\xe2\x80\x99s spot starts last season. And the same can often be true in reverse; many times starting pitchers struggle when they\xe2\x80\x99re asked to take the ball in relief at various points.One way or the other, Matusz and Britton find themselves in situations whereby they\xe2\x80\x99ll get sent packing if they cease to get the job done properly. However the better they look, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible that the starting rotation gets further and further out of their grasp. The big difference between my example from the soccer team and their situation is that in their case we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about two professional athletes as opposed to a weak-willed twelve-year old boy who hated running. (Note to that twelve-year old: you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a center forward in about two years\xe2\x80\xa6so cool your britches!)\xc2\xa0But it does illustrate a dilema that can be very real for some pitchers.The late Mike Flanagan became a reliever late in his career, but Britton and Matusz are much younger than he was at that time. Aside from perhaps your top-of-the-line closers such as Dennis Eckersley or Mariano Rivera, there\xe2\x80\x99s probably not a reliever in baseball that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a starter or who didn\xe2\x80\x99t set out to be a starter. But those are just the turns that the game sometimes gives players. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times, baseball often mirrors life; and life\xe2\x80\x99s not always perfect or easy. Luckily for the Orioles and their fans, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing about Britton or Matusz that indicates they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be good at their roles as relievers. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in the rotation, however it would be disappointing if the disappointment wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there.

""He\'s someone who\'s Orioles through and through, but can take the emotion out of it. You can\'t think with your heart. You\'ve got to think with your head on these things. He really wants to be good at it. Talking to a lot of people who knew him here in town, it just kept coming back to him. He brought all the qualities we were looking for. He is as invested in the Orioles as you can be and still be objective.""Gladstone, 42, might not be familiar to Orioles fans, but he is no stranger to the organization or anyone involved in pro baseball in the Mid-Atlantic region. He set out to be a major league umpire \xe2\x80\x94 attending the Jim Evans Academy of Professional Umpiring \xe2\x80\x94 and knocked around the independent leagues until moving into a series of front office positions, including a stint with Cal and Bill Ripken and the Aberdeen Ironbirds.""It\'s funny,\'\' Gladstone said. ""I\'ve done a lot of reflecting since this whole situation came about, and what was interesting was if you took my career in professional baseball, really only 30 percent of it was umpiring, but it\'s funny to see that was how I got my start in professional baseball and it took me to many different areas, but ultimately was what got me to this level.""Of course, even though he is not in uniform and sits in a room full of video screens off the dugout tunnel, he\'s still subject to one of baseball\'s great truisms: It may be hard to get to the major leagues, but it\'s even harder to stay there.The replay guy for each major league team is working in seriously uncharted territory. Baseball has been using replay for the past few years to correct or confirm tough ""border"" calls, but the new system is far more complicated, requiring quick analysis of multiple camera angles, a signal system with the dugout and the ability to interpret the rules and recognize the tendencies of the replay crew that makes the final decision in New York.For instance, it\'s possible that a challenge could be lost \xe2\x80\x94 and a game with it \xe2\x80\x94 simply because of a difference in interpretation of the word ""inconclusive."" How close does a play have to be before the eyes in the sky aren\'t willing to overrule the umpires on the ground?Showalter is a stickler for details like that, but he doesn\'t want to put unnecessary pressure on Gladstone when there is so much about the new system that is yet to be learned.""I\'m not going to,\'\' Showalter said. ""He has to do what he does. You\'ve got to go with your gut. If I\'m talking to a doctor about a player, I\'m going to say, \'You\'re the professional here. You do this. You tell me what you think about Markakis\' neck or Manny Machado\'s knee and that\'s what we go with. You\'re the professional. But if you\'re wrong 20 times in a row, we\'ll get another doctor.\' It\'s the same thing here. I\'m obviously going to be very supportive of him, because it\'s a hard job.""Gladstone admits there have been some ""butterflies"" during the first few days of the regular season, but said he is comfortable with the upgraded equipment the Orioles have installed and confident that Showalter has prepared him well for a job that really didn\'t exist a month ago.""Yeah, I can actually say, Buck did such a great job of testing me in spring training and getting me ready for the game,\'\' Gladstone said. ""Nothing changed. It wasn\'t like \'Okay, we\'re in spring training, we\'re in this mode. Now, we\'re in the regular season and we\'re in this mode.\' Everything was clear and consistent in the way we reacted. That didn\'t change. It\'s almost like I\'m sitting here umpiring along with the four guys who are umpiring the game.""In a sense, he is. Though he is employed by the team and clearly is there to advocate for the Orioles, Gladstone views his role as assisting the umpires in reaching the correct decision.""It\'s almost like walking a tightrope,\'\' he said. ""If someone falls off the tightrope, I\'m there to catch them and I\'m there to help the organization in a scenario that could help turn a negative into a positive.""Upon further review, he looks like the right guy for the job.peter.schmuck@baltsun.comtwitter.com/SchmuckStopRead more from columnist Peter Schmuck on his blog, ""The Schmuck Stops Here"" at baltimoresun.com/schmuckblog and listen when he co-hosts ""The Week in Review"" on Friday mornings at 9 on WBAL (1090 AM) and at wbal.com.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:The old oyster R-month rulePriest at once defended, excoriatedArundel\'s Hibbs loses scholarship to Florida State after drug arrestA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

However throw in the fact that the team\xe2\x80\x99s plane was late getting to the airport causing them to get into their hotel 2-3 hours late, combined with lousy conditions (including a 30+ minute rain delay in the fourth inning), and it probably would have taken a miracle for the Orioles to be ready to play. Not to mention the fact that J.J. Hardy became the second Oriole to fall victim to spasms (lower back in his case) on the team\xe2\x80\x99s flight, f0rcing him out of the lineup.If Buck Showalter and Adam Jones were to read this, they\xe2\x80\x99d call the aforementioned paragraph an excuse. And they\xe2\x80\x99d probably be right in doing so. Ultimately each person and each team is responsible for overcoming whatever challenges that are thrown out there. And you either overcome them, or you don\xe2\x80\x99t. If you\xe2\x80\x99re unable to overcome those challenges, you come back the next day and try to do so again. In the case of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game, Miguel Gonzalez breezed through the first inning, and struggled in the second. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 3.1 IP, 9 H, 7 R, 1 BB, 1 K.The O\xe2\x80\x99s took an early lead when Chris Davis doubled home two runners following a Jones walk. And that in and of itself is worth mentioning as a positive on a day when things seemed to go against the Orioles. Jones has been much more patient at the plate, and it\xe2\x80\x99s paid off. \xc2\xa0However that was the full extent of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense yesterday. Gonzalez struggled through the last of the second giving up an RBI-double to Castellanos, an RBI-single to Kinsler, and allowed a third run after hitting a batter (to load the bases) and a wild pitch. Detroit never looked back after that, although the O\xe2\x80\x99s did put across a two runs in the ninth inning.You don\xe2\x80\x99t lose by eight runs and point at one thing, however the rain got to be too much in theCourtesy of Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sportslast of the fourth inning and the umpires called for the tarp. The teams sat through 30 plus minutes of a rain delay, and Buck Showalter sent Gonzalez right back out after the rain delay. Granted the delay wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long, however as much as Gonzalez was struggling prior to the \xe2\x80\x9cpause\xe2\x80\x9d I would have considered lifting him. Managers will often do that, albeit normally after lengthier delays than what the Orioles had. How the game would have played out, we\xe2\x80\x99ll never know; but we do know that Rajai Davis hit a three-run homer, and Tori Hunter a solo shot following the delay. Hunter would also add an RBI-single in the last of the third, and Victor Martinez netted his 2,000th hit as a major leaguer in the form of a two-run homer in the eighth.If there\xe2\x80\x99s a silver lining for the Orioles, it was the ninth inning. \xc2\xa0Following a Nelson Cruz single, backup catcher Steve Clevenger (who started for Matt Wieters in a day game after a night game) drove in the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 first run since the first inning with an RBI-triple. He would later score on Jonathan Schoop\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single, however the O\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an eight-run comeback in them as they fell 10-4.Offensively my personal opinion is that other teams are in fact afraid of Oriole bats in a sense. Their only shot around the likes of Davis, Jones, etc. is to get them to chase. Unfortunately, the Orioles are obliging them. Jones is starting to sit on pitches, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a positive sign. However the entire lineup needs to find a way to get on track. 1-3 is nothing in baseball, however you have to be careful that 1-3 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t turn into 2-16 as it did in 2010. (And the fact is that this team has much higher expectations than that one.) As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said previously, it begins and ends however with starting pitching. Thus far that has been suspect. However all it takes is one good game and/or one good start to get things rolling the other way.This game was noteworthy in the sense that it was the first one that featured a challenged play involving the Orioles. Albeit Detroit was the team that made the challenge, however in the fifth inning Steve Lombardozzi slid hard into second base to break up a possible double-play, and the shortstop bobbled the ball \xe2\x80\x93 after having touched the bag. Lombardozzi was ruled safe, which was challenged and upheld. I would tend to think that he should have been called out, however needless to say in the first replay challenge involving the Orioles, the Birds emerged victorious.Bud Norris will get his first start of 2014 this afternoon, and will do so in hopes that he can be the team\xe2\x80\x99s stopper. Norris will be opposed by Rick Porcello, who Detroit had penciled in as going to the Orioles prior to last season when they had their eyes on J.J. Hardy. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see who got the better of that non-trade later this afternoon. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Norfolk 1, Charlotte 2: An uninspiring affair in which T.J. McFarland, Jemile Weeks and Ivan DeJesus starred for the good guys. Making the start for the Tides, McFarland went a solid four innings. His sinker got the job done as he induced five ground outs, but McFarland also struck out five Knights. Weeks continued his hot start with another hit and walk. In his first regular season action of the 2014 season, Ivan DeJesus, Jr. was 2 for 3 with a double. Brock Huntzinger and Kelvin De La Cruz closed the game out with three innings of shutout ball. Bowie 10, Harrisburg 5: Making his AA debut, 21 year old Zach Davies struck out five hitters and induced five ground outs over five innings. The Chandler, AZ native also allowed three walks and an earned run. Davies has methodically moved through the system and also up organizational prospect lists. Christian Walker and Dariel Alvarez doubled, but surely, if any member of the Baysox will be sorry to leave Harrisburg, it will be Sharlon Schoop. The elder Schoop has gone 6 for 7 with two doubles and two walks in the past two games. Maybe it's my bias for the guys that make it out of the Dominican Republic, but I've always rooted for Garabez Rosa. While the young middle infielder has been surpassed by Manny Machado and Jonathan Schoop, he's still only 24 and is off to an encouraging start with a .375/.412/.625 slashline to start the season. Rough day for Michael Ohlman. The heir apparent to Matt Wieters struck out three time and was charged with a passed ball. Frederick 6, Lynchburg 2: Glynn Davis will not be ignored. This will be the fourth season in which the 21 year old has played at least one game at Frederick, but if he's able to maintain any of the heat he's generated in the first four games of this season, maybe he'll find himself in Bowie sooner rather than later. Davis has hit safely in four straight games to the tune of a manly .471, beefed up by his four hit performance in this afternoon's game. Trent Mummey walked twice and had a base hit to push his OBP up to .500. The Hobgoblin allowed four baserunners and an earned run in 2.2 innings.    Delmarva 4, Asheville 2: After four turns at short season ball, Sebastian Vader made his Sally League debut. The Dark Lord held the Tourists to one earned run in six innings. He walked none, struck out five and induced seven ground outs. Jimmy Yacabonis closed things out with strikeouts in 1.2 innings. Mike Yastrzemski picked up another outfield assist for the Shorebirds. That's five in four games if you're keeping count. Baby Yaz also walked twice. In his first action of 2014, Hector Veloz was 1 for 3 with a walk and a strikeout. He was the day's DH, so he was able to avoid being charged with any errors. Chance Sisco went o for 4 with a strikeout.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Now that we are all calm, let\xe2\x80\x99s review this past week and then preview the upcoming week\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.The Orioles are 2-4, winning their home opener against the Boston Red Sox, followed by a four-game losing streak with two losses to both the Red Sox and the Detroit Tigers, and finally a win against Detroit ace, Justin Verlander.The storylines so far have been the underperforming pitching staff and a sputtering offense.

Ubaldo Jimenez (6 IP, 4 ER), Wei-Yin Chen (5.2 IP, 4 ER), Miguel Gonzalez (3.1 IP, 7 ER), and Bud Norris (5 IP, 5 ER) all started the season 0-1.While some fans have merely brushed those struggles off, citing that it is only the first week of the season, other fans have not been as easy going. I see both sides of this. I understand that it is early and things can turn around quickly, but I also believed that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters would be their weakness prior to start of the season, and those starts only reinforced that thinking. Cold, wet weather may have played a role in Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s start, and it is reasonable to think that the rain delay in Detroit may have opened the floodgates in that particular game, but the other starters really don\xe2\x80\x99t have much of an excuse aside from pitching against two of the best offensive teams in baseball.One\xc2\xa0bright spot for the Orioles was Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa0(1-0) performances against both Boston on opening day and Detroit on Sunday. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s first start was good, not great. In 5 IP, he gave up just 1 ER. Many would have liked to see him pitch efficient enough to go deeper, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint in his second start in Detroit. Against the Tigers, Tillman pitched 8.1 IP and gave up just 1 ER for his first win of the season. He clearly is Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s ace and it is nice to know that there is finally someone to stop the bleeding going forward.Aside from the starters, we saw Tommy Hunter successfully save both opportunities. We now know that he is the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 closer, despite the lack of any official announcement by manager Buck Showalter. In three appearances (two save opportunities), Hunter has \xc2\xa0pitched 1.1 IP with no earned runs and one hit allowed. A very small sample size, but we know now who the closer is.As for hitting, there really should be no concern over the lineup. The Orioles hitters have scored just 20 runs in their first six games while batting a very disappointing .229. Catcher Matt Wieters led the team with 7 hits including a double and a home run, however there are were no real notable standouts offensively. The core of the Orioles lineup will hit, without a doubt, but injuries have made for an interesting bottom half of the lineup in the first week.Where Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s absence was easy to foresee, J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0limited in playing time due to back spasms forced\xc2\xa0Jonathan Schoop, Ryan Flaherty and Steve Lombardozzi into the lineup all at once. How long the injury will persist is unknown, but it is clear that the lack of legitimate infield depth put the Orioles in a tough spot offensively in the first week.The Orioles will look to find their groove this week against the Yankees in New York and the Toronto Blue Jays at Camden Yards. In the Yankees series, it will be Jimenez (0-1, 6.00) v. Hiroki Kuroda (0-1, 3.00), Chen (0-1, 6.35) v. Nova (1-0, 3.18) and Gonzalez (0-1, 18.90) v. Tanaka (1-0, 2.57). Kuroda has had success against the Orioles, going 2-3 with just a 3.20 ERA in six games, while holding Orioles hitters to a .238 AVG, and will face Jimenez who has a 6.45 ERA in four starts against the Yankees for the first matchup between the two teams in the 2014 regular season.\xc2\xa0One storyline to look forward to in the Yankees series is if the Orioles trail by three or less runs in the ninth inning. Orioles fans will no longer have to limit games against the Yankees to eight innings, now that legendary closer Mariano Rivera has retired. Though Nate Robertson is a formidable pitcher, he is no Rivera and that has to count for something.The Orioles went 9-10 against the Yankees and 10-9 against the Blue Jays last season and will look to get back on track against two of their divisional foes. Their pitching will again have to face off against strong hitting teams, but it will be important to see some improvements as divisional matchups are always important, no matter the month, ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Series Preview: Baltimore Orioles @ New York Yankees, 7-9 ...', ' 2-4 isn\'t a great way to start the season, but thank goodness for that win yesterday, because it\'s a lot better than 1-5. The Yankees started their season 3-3, but got to open against the Astros and Blue Jays. Monday, 7 April: Ubaldo Jimenez @ Hiroki Kuroda     Jimenez Kuroda   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 182.2 6.0 201.1 6.0   ERA 3.30 6.00 3.31 3.00   FIP 3.43 7.52 3.56 4.18   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .239/.317/.367 .227/.346/.500 .249/.291/.392 .143/.182/.476     Jimenez didn\'t impress in his first start as an Oriole, giving up a pair of two-run home runs. Otherwise, though, his line for that game doesn\'t look too bad: 6 IP, 5 H, 3 BB, 6 SO. Unfortunately, pitching in the AL East means that you\'re going to spend a lot of time in homer-friendly ballparks, and Yankee Stadium is one of them. In a press release announcing the signing, the Orioles tried to sell Jimenez as a groundball pitcher, but he hasn\'t been since his time with the Rockies. Here\'s hoping that his last outing wasn\'t a sign of things to come. Kuroda started off his season well enough, allowing two runs and three hits over six innings against the Astros, with five strikeouts to one walk. He\'s arguably been the Yankees\' best starter for the last couple of years, though some struggles in the second half of last season made some scouts question whether he was finally just getting too old to be effective. Kuroda throws a sinker most often, at 43% of the time to batters regardless of handedness. He has a slider he\'ll throw most often to righties (38%), but he\'ll mix it in against lefties early in the count, too. He also features a splitter, which he uses against lefties nearly 50% of the time when ahead in the count or with two strikes, and he\'ll use it to try to strike out righties as well. Finally, he\'ll occasionally toss a first-pitch get-me-over curve or an 0-1 four-seamer against lefties.    Maybe hot: Nick Markakis (.947 OPS, 19 PA), Carlos Beltran (1.417 OPS, 12 PA)    Likely not: Nelson Cruz (.205 OPS, 15 PA), Ichiro Suzuki (.500 OPS, 12 PA) Tuesday, 8 April: Wei-Yin Chen @ Ivan Nova     Chen Nova   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 137.0 5.2 139.1 5.2   ERA 4.07 6.35 3.10 3.18   FIP 4.04 1.42 3.47 6.54   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .272/.321/.440 .444/.444/.481 .258/.330/.348 .316/.500/.368        Chen got knocked around for twelve hits in 5.2 innings in his 2014 debut. I missed the game, but from Mark\'s writeup, it sounds like Chen was just very unlucky, and his defense didn\'t help him out any, either. Chen didn\'t walk any and struck out five, which just reinforces the notion that the baseball gods were against him that night, and it gives us reason for optimism going forward. Nova walked five batters in his first start of the season, while only striking out one. Somehow, despite allowing six hits as well, he only allowed two runs over his 5.2 innings of work. Nova struggled against the O\'s in 2012, but threw two complete games against them last year, in what was a bit of a breakout season for him. He throws fastballs about 60% of the time, roughly 2:1 sinkers to four-seamers against lefties, but the reverse ratio against righties. Most of the rest of his pitches are curveballs, used about 35% of the time regardless of batter handedness. Nova also has a changeup and slider/cutter, but he almost never uses them. Maybe hot: Matt Wieters (1.351 OPS, 33 PA), Brett Gardner (1.711 OPS, 10 PA)    Likely not: Adam Jones (.488 OPS, 39 PA), Ichiro Suzuki (.222 OPS, 9 PA) Wednesday, 9 April: Miguel Gonzalez @ Masahiro Tanaka     Gonzalez Tanaka   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 (NPB) YTD   IP 171.1 3.1 212.0 7.0   ERA 3.78 18.90 1.27 2.57   FIP 4.45 13.08 - 2.75   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .243/.300/.413 .529/.600/1.000 - .222/.222/.370     Gonzalez just did not have it on Friday. He only lasted 3.1 innings, plunked two batters, and gave up seven runs on nine hits (two homers) and a walk. Enough scouts and analysts have been saying that Gonzalez is basically the new Jeremy Guthrie, outpitching his peripherals until he doesn\'t, and every time he has a bad start or two, it\'s hard not to worry that ""doesn\'t"" has finally arrived. That said, one start is one start, and pitchers with Gonzalez\'s lack of overwhelming stuff are just going to have bad ones on occasion. Despite allowing a leadoff homer, Tanaka was impressive in his MLB debut, striking out eight Blue Jays and walking none over seven innings. Tanaka\'s main weapons are reportedly four- and two-seam fastballs, the ratio of which he varies by batter handedness, much like Nova; a splitter, which he throws often as a strikeout pitch to both righties and lefties; a slider, which he uses often to strike out righties; and a curve, which is mostly a first-pitch show-me option.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAfter a great final game of the series win in Detroit (summary here) in what may be remembered as a critical early game of the season, the Baltimore Orioles head to New York for their first series against the Yankees. The 1:05 game will be the home opener for the Yankees \xe2\x80\x93 sure to be a bit strange for Pinstripes people as the final home opener for Derek Jeter, along with it being odd for Orioles fans to see that Brian Roberts fellow on the dark side of the field.It will be interesting to see what new Orioles starter Ubaldo Jimenez can really do against the evil empire. Will he handle them fine as a key component of the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 rotation? Or will he revert to his historic performance record of a 6.45 ERA over four games? That sample size is small indeed, and though Ulbaldo was overcome by a couple of homers in his first outing, one could also see some great ball movement and the makings of a dominant pitcher.The two members of the Yankees that Jimenez has most often faced are Kelly Johnson and Brian McCann from their days together in the National League. McCann is 8-for-25, though with only one homer as his single extra-base hit. Johnson is 8-for-43, though has an addition nine walks. Carlos Beltran is 4-for-11 with two homers. On the other hand, Mark Teixeira is but 1-for-18 and Ichero Suzuki 3-for-12.PAABH2B3BHRRBIBBSOBAKelly Johnson43338400194.242Brian McCann28258001334.320Mark Teixeira18161000127.063Carlos Beltran12114102310.364Alfonso Soriano992000102.222Ichero Suzuki1293000202.250Jacoby Ellsbury752000120.400Brett Gardner771000101.143Derek Jeter330000101.000Brian Roberts330000001.000\xc2\xa0The Yankees will look to Hiroki Kuroda to open their home season. Last year in four games, Kuroda was 1-2 against the Orioles, with a no-decision won by the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Two of these starts were terrific, whereas two were very poor. On April 7, Kuroda pitched what I recall as the most dominant game against the Orioles in 2013, giving up five hits in a complete game shutout. And again on July 7th he pitched seven shutout innings in a game he departed with a 1-0 lead, though the Orioles would later score two in the 9th inning to win. But in the other two starts against the Birds, he gave up nine runs in eight innings.In the 39-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s first start this season against Houston, he yielded two runs on three hits in six innings.Among Orioles hitters, Nick Markakis has the best numbers against Kuroda, being 7-for-19 with a homer. Matt Wieters is 6-for-19, and though Chris Davis is only 5-for-24, he has two homers and a double. Nelson Cruz is a mere 1-for 15 and J.J. Hardy is but 3-for-24 \xe2\x80\x93 maybe his back will need another day of rest.PAABH2B3BHRRBIBBSOBAChris Davis24205102517.250J.J.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsApart from Chris Tillman, the Baltimore Orioles starting pitching woes continued on Monday with a first game of the series loss to the Yankees 4-2. Failing to get through five innings was Ubaldo Jimenez, who once again had some good stuff with movement, but the issuance of five walks was his downfall.While watching Jimenez, I love the great ball movement. But today I found myself thinking about how four years of watching these deep counts and free passes is going to drive me crazy, and I honestly think I get to crazy land slower than most O\xe2\x80\x99s fans. But I do think he will figure this out sufficiently. He has to! There are 50 million reasons why he must!And again, though the starting pitching dominates the talk of Orioles fans and has been, so far, the fulfillment of their greatest fears, the run production has been as large a problem. Really, four runs given up should not guarantee a loss \xe2\x80\x93 not to a team with the powerful lineup the Orioles run out on the field. But unfortunately, too many are not playing near their potential or historic averages. You never get a full line-up hitting perfectly on all cylinders, but right now the Orioles have most of their players underachieving at the same time. This will change \xe2\x80\xa6 we just don\xe2\x80\x99t want the hole to get too deep before it does.So, in trying to find even a single good pitching performance other than those by Tillman, the Orioles look again to Wei-Yin Chen \xe2\x80\x93 coming off a first game, 12-hit attack by the Red Sox last week. And the rest of this paragraph is not going to encourage you either. You were warned! Chen is 1-3 lifetime against the Yankees with a 5.34 ERA in seven starts and 40.1 innings pitched. He has seen nine Yankees take him deep.Against the current Yankees lineup, his record is not terribly poor. Many of those who hurt him most are now gone. Gardner is 5-for-9 and Soriano 3-for-4.

This might also be a good game to give Delmon Young a shot, as he has been 7-for-13 with two homers. Adam Jones, Nick Markakis, and J.J.

It would not open.\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t even get into my bats,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said with a sigh, hands on his hips, waiting.

Jeter reached into the vertical case, pulled out the bat like sword from a stone, tapped the Joe DiMaggio sign above the stairs with his fingers and went to work.The bat did not help him when he struck out in the first inning, or in the sixth, when he whiffed again. In between were a double-play grounder that brought in a run and a double off the left-field wall.The double received all the attention, because Jeter did not run hard from the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box and had to slide, headfirst, to narrowly beat the throw. The press box was aghast \xe2\x80\x94 since when did Jeter turn into Timo Perez? \xe2\x80\x94 but the dugout loved it.

The joke fell flat, but Jeter, who has built a legacy of cool by avoiding awkwardness, found a way to recover.Jeter tries to win every confrontation, from a duel with a pitcher to a tricky question from a writer, but here he acknowledged the obvious.\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, look, maybe you get caught up in opening day and I thought it was a home run,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI hit it good enough to be one, it just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, didn\xe2\x80\x99t go out.

Such awareness, Showalter said, gave Jeter a sense of calm and kept him from panicking at pivotal moments.We have entered the countdown for Jeter to add more such memories. Some of his recent ones are commemorated in a clubhouse hallway, where the Yankees this year have hung seven Opie Otterstad paintings depicting scenes from the last five years. Jeter is featured in all of them.He must have known it would play out this way, a final season as a certified icon who still must prepare for that day\xe2\x80\x99s game. Jeter recognizes the ticking clock but tries to suppress his emotions. If he lingers too long in a moment, he might get thrown out at second.

Here was his final home opener, and as the ball zoomed closer to the wall, it appeared Jeter would again put his indelible stamp on Yankee history, just as he had with his famous flip, his dive into the stands, his World Series home runs and his 3,000th hit.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it before,\xe2\x80\x9d Roberts said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe always seemed to do something special in the big moment.\xe2\x80\x9dAs it turned out, the ball hit the wall for a double, not a home run, and it did not vault to the top of Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s greatest memories. This game, in fact, contained no signature moment that was distinctly Jeter \xe2\x80\x94 not until the very last play of the game, when the Yankees won. That, after all, is probably what defines Jeter the most.On a chilly, gray day with rain threatening, the new-look Yankees beat the Baltimore Orioles, 4-2, at Yankee Stadium, the 1,560th regular-season game the Yankees have won with Jeter in the lineup. But as it was with the other 1,559, Jeter did not win it alone. It was a typical Yankees win, with several players contributing, most notably the starting pitcher, Hiroki Kuroda, who, like Jeter, is 39. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Kuroda took the mound moments after Andy Pettitte and Mariano Rivera threw ceremonial first pitches to Jeter and Jorge Posada, and he then provided an outing worthy of his predecessors\xe2\x80\x99 high standards.

But even now, the four players who take the infield these days for the Yankees are hardly recognizable.On Tuesday, the backup catcher Francisco Cervelli made his first career appearance as a professional at first base, in place of the injured Mark Teixeira. Brian Roberts, 36, who replaced the departed Robinson Cano, was at second. The rookie Yangervis Solarte, replacing the suspended Alex Rodriguez, played third. Even Jeter hardly looks like himself these days.This group is prone to defensive lapses because of the players\xe2\x80\x99 ages or their inexperience at certain positions.Yankees starter Ivan Nova was not effective (seven earned runs in three and two-thirds innings) in a 14-5 loss to the Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium, but he did not have much help from his infield defense, either. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      In the first inning, after Nick Markakis had led off the game with a single to center field, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 designated hitter, Delmon Young, hit a ground ball toward the shortstop side of second base. After a slow couple of steps, Jeter lunged but could not snag the grounder, which went into center for a single. A shortstop with better range than Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 he is rated near the bottom in most defensive metrics \xe2\x80\x94 could have turned that grounder into a double play, or at least a forceout.

It seemed to get through the infield fairly quickly. But he did everything he could.\xe2\x80\x9dA diplomatic Nova said that it was impossible to assume what would happen once a ball was put into play.\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you want to get the double play, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out that way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.With the Yankees trailing by 3-1 in the second, Orioles second baseman Ryan Flaherty hit a bunt toward first base that slipped past Nova and was fielded by Cervelli, who could not make a play in time. The next batter, Jonathan Schoop, lined a ball that Solarte was unable to catch, and it went down the line for a run-scoring double.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees rely heavily on positioning to compensate for their infield, which is by turns slow-moving and inexperienced. They have their infielders shift sharply toward a particular side if their advance reports say a player hits the ball to that area. For example, the Yankees had Solarte move to the right side when the left-handed Baltimore slugger Chris Davis \xe2\x80\x94 who hit 53 home runs last season \xe2\x80\x94 was up to bat. But they will use a shift for any player, not just power hitters. On Monday, the Yankees employed a similar right-side shift for the light-hitting Flaherty, who had a .683 on-base plus slugging percentage last year.

But the one thing they cannot do for Jeter is turn back the clock to make him quicker on balls hit away from him. Shifts can do only so much.

We look at histories and our pitchers and what type of pitches they have. We try to put them in the best play possible. Sometimes, they don\xe2\x80\x99t always go there, but we\xe2\x80\x99re playing the law of averages. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to see it work a lot more than not work. But every once in a while, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to go the way we want.\xe2\x80\x9dNova was as much to blame for the poor day as the infield was. The seven earned runs were the most he had allowed since Aug. 6, 2012.Even after Nova\xe2\x80\x99s poor start, the Yankees trailed by just three runs through five innings. But Young\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer off reliever Vidal Nuno began the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 four-run sixth, putting the game out of reach.

Yankees catcher Brian McCann said Nova simply could not get into a groove throwing his fastball down in the zone, making his curveball less effective.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  On top of his bad outing, Nova said he felt responsible for the missed play on Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s bunt in the second inning. Cervelli said he had not wanted to risk a throw to first because nobody was in position to catch the ball.\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my fault,\xe2\x80\x9d Nova said. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have made that play. I should have run to the base or run straight at the ball.\xe2\x80\x9dIn the end, Nova\xe2\x80\x99s infield play was no better than his teammates\xe2\x80\x99.

Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY SportsBeing a migratory species of fowl, the Baltimore Oriole can\xe2\x80\x99t really be expected to be seen much in cold weather. And sure enough, when a decently warm day for baseball finally arrived, so did the real Baltimore Orioles who laid a 14-5, 20-hit spanking upon the Yankees. This is the baseball team we expected to see!Orioles fans everywhere are hoping that this is the big breakout game that launches the offensive attack for the 2014 season. Everyone in the Orioles starting lineup got into the act. We could continue to pick on Ryan Flaherty by noting that he was the only starter to not register a RBI, although he was one of three Orioles to get three hits in the game. And the Birds broke out with three homers as well: by Adam Jones, Delmon Young, and Matt Wieters.As further proof that Buck Showalter reads my columns and takes advice for the next day, he noted my wise suggestion from yesterday that Young should be put in the lineup \xe2\x80\x93 having stellar numbers historically against Yankees starter Ivan Nova. Young batted second in the lineup and had three hits and three RBIs.Young may get some more playing time, as David Lough is being reported to be headed to the DL for (at this point) undisclosed reasons, with Jemile Weeks being recalled. Weeks was 6-for-12 in his first four games at AAA Norfolk with two triples.Pretty much everything went right for the Orioles offense on Tuesday. The bottom three guys in the order \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Lombardozzi, Flaherty, and Jonathan Schoop were a combined 8-for-15. That is when you know your team is having a good day!It is also great to see Matt Wieters hitting well at the beginning of this new season. This was one of the concerns coming into 2014 \xe2\x80\x93 that Wieters was never going to live up to the hopes for offensive output that were placed upon him when he first arrived in Baltimore. Right now he is batting .370 through the first eight games \xe2\x80\x93 10-for-27 with two homers and six RBIs.But not lost in the euphoria was another rather poor outing for an Orioles starter. Chen was able to get the win after pitching through five tortuous and torturous (twisting and painful) innings, giving up four runs on nine hits \xe2\x80\xa6 and now having an ERA of 6.75. This will have to change.The Orioles will be facing the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 new pitching sensation Masahiro Tanaka in the series finale on Wednesday evening. In only his second game, Tanaka won his first outing over the Blue Jays 7-3. He gave up two earned runs in seven innings of six-hit pitching, while recording eight strikeouts.Baltimore continues to look for a pitcher other than Chris Tillman to throw a decent game, and the next man up is Miguel Gonzalez. His first outing was difficult, as the Tigers drubbed him with seven runs on nine hits in just 3.1 innings of work.Gonzalez may draw some additional inner fortitude and strength in that he will certainly be cognizant of pitching on the fifth anniversary of the tragic death of his friend Nick Adenhart. The two knew each other from their days in the Angels organization, and Gonzalez used a glove belonging to Adenhart in his first start for the Orioles two years ago. In that Nick is from my town of Williamsport and was a classmate and friend of one of my sons, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have an additional article (to follow this one) on the Maryland native.In seven career games against the Yankees, Gonzalez is 2-2 with a 4.01 ERA. His WHIP is a very solid 1.17 and the batting average against is but .224 \xe2\x80\x93 all good numbers against New York.

One of his fondest memories is of his father taking him to his first game at Yankee Stadium in 1954. The Indians were playing the Yankees. He was amazed at how the field glowed.\xe2\x80\x9cIt rained,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cso the grass was even greener.\xe2\x80\x9dPalmer eventually made his own memories in major league parks around the country. His r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 includes 268 victories, a .638 winning percentage, eight 20-win seasons and a 2.86 earned run average in 19 seasons. He is the only pitcher to win World Series games in three decades, in 1966, 1970, 1971 and 1983. He won three Cy Young Awards and four Gold Gloves. He threw a no-hitter against Oakland in 1969 and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990.Palmer, 68, now a television commentator for Orioles games, expects the team to contend for the playoffs.His charity work includes support for Autism Speaks, the autism advocacy organization, and for B.A.T., or the Baseball Assistance Team, which helps former players and baseball employees who have fallen on hard times. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Q. How do you spend your time away from baseball?A. In the winter, my wife, Susan, has a shop in Palm Beach \xe2\x80\x94 Island Home. I help her there. My stepson, Spencer, is autistic. He\xe2\x80\x99s 17 and I take him to school and we go to the gym and I do a lot of things with him. I do a lot of fund-raising in Palm Beach and support Autism Speaks.Q. Is there a pitcher who reminds you of you?A. Michael Wacha of the Cardinals has a similar windup. He comes over the top and throws hard. He has the big curveball. We both got to the big leagues very early.Q. What do you think of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 additions of Nelson Cruz and Ubaldo Jimenez?A. I was at the Orioles Fanfest and said to Dan Duquette, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, the most well-rested G.M. in baseball.\xe2\x80\x9d I have that kind of relationship with him. He started laughing. He said hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99re not done. Then they go out and get Jimenez and Cruz. Jimenez had a great last 16 games last year. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s power will help replace Nate McLouth offensively, although he won\xe2\x80\x99t be as good defensively or give you the same speed.I love their core players: Matt Wieters, Adam Jones, Chris Davis, J. J. Hardy, Nick Markakis, who was not healthy last year, Manny Machado. Brooks Robinson told me, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if Machado\xe2\x80\x99s not better than I was. That\xe2\x80\x99s quite a statement. I see them as contenders.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Q. How do you think Masahiro Tanaka will do for the Yankees?A. Culture, strike zone, facing the best hitters on the planet. Yankee Stadium is not easy to pitch in. There\xe2\x80\x99s always an adjustment period. The Yankees would be very pleased if he pitched as well as Yu Darvish has.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Q. What do you think about Derek Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s retiring?A. Baseball is going to miss him. He\xe2\x80\x99s one of the transcendent players. I\xe2\x80\x99ve played with Eddie Murray, Frank Robinson, Brooks Robinson and Cal Ripken Jr. They\xe2\x80\x99re graceful, have a tremendous work ethic. Reliable. I once asked Derek, your lifetime average is what, .312? You almost hit the same with runners in scoring position. He looked at me and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what changes?\xe2\x80\x9d The mind-set of Derek Jeter was that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what stage he played on. He was able to be the same player and do it for 20 years.

The love/hate relationship that I supposedly had with Earl Weaver. I wish I had been a little more mature in my relationship with Earl. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it would have changed anything. That and the fact that you learn not to judge people by your standards. When I got to the Hall of Fame I gave him a lot of credit. Any time a manager puts your name in the starting lineup as the pitcher that means he trusts you. And Earl did it over a 10-, 11-, 12-year period.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Q. What hitter who was not a star player gave you the most trouble?A. Doug Griffin. I pitched away and he loved the ball out over the plate. He was an outside-half hitter. That all changed when Nolan Ryan hit him in the helmet. He stopped diving.Q. What do you think of the expanded use of replay review?A. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to fine-tune it to make sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t make the game longer. But it\xe2\x80\x99s in the spirit of trying to get the calls right. It\xe2\x80\x99s embraced by baseball, and the umpires want to get calls right. Being an umpire is probably the most difficult thing in baseball. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to hit 97-mile-an-hour pitches, curves and sliders. But every time you make a call, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make somebody unhappy.Q. Should players who used performance-enhancing drugs be allowed in the Hall of Fame?A. Cal Ripken Sr. once told me when I was 18 years old \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99re all in Class A, making $414 after taxes, living in basements, trying to get to Double A \xe2\x80\x94 there are no such things as shortcuts. In a perfect world, they don\xe2\x80\x99t get in even though there are some deserving guys who were Hall of Fame players. They just decided to take shortcuts. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a baseball writer, but I would be more inclined to vote for the guys who used them and still were Hall of Fame caliber players.The most difficult thing is how are you going to hurt the Barry Bondses of the world, the Roger Clemenses, who did not need to do anything? The writers at some point might say Bonds was going to get to the Hall of Fame, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to hit 73 home runs.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  And if they let anybody who used performance-enhancing drugs in, then Pete Rose ought to get in the same year.Q. Would Major League Baseball welcome an openly gay player?A. I see no reason why not. The great thing about baseball is you can really be a zebra, but it\xe2\x80\x99s about if you can play or not. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about race or sexuality.Q. What\xe2\x80\x99s on your iPod?A. My wife is a George Strait fan, and I listen to him. I listen to Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. They bet on the Orioles in 1966, 40 to 1, to win four straight. A thousand dollars. And the next year I got invited to see Frank at the Fontainebleau in Miami Beach in spring training. But, unfortunately, they play a lot of Sinatra at Yankee Stadium when they beat the Orioles.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  This interview was condensed and edited.

Schoop made the Earl of Baltimore proud with the three-run bomb, and that kind of production from the 9 hitter is always welcomed.\xc2\xa0 Then there was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 ninth inning.\xc2\xa0 An inning of beauty! The Orioles keep producing in the 9th, and they tagged Shawn Kelley with numerous bloops to bring in two runs. Delmon Young turned in another solid game, going 3-5 with a double. Matt Wieters kept his hitting streak to start the season going as well. Eight of the nine Orioles that started had hits, only Nelson Cruz was hitless. Miguel Gonzalez did pretty well, save for the second inning.\xc2\xa0 More on that below.\xc2\xa0 But speaking of pitchers, how about Brian Matusz.\xc2\xa0 Comes in with a man on third and one out, and it is the speedy Brett Gardner. And he goes nowhere.\xc2\xa0 Ellsbury pops out in foul territory to Schoop and then Brian McCann hits it to Adam JonesThe BAD: Miguel Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s two solo home runs allowed.\xc2\xa0 Yes it didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose the Orioles the game, and it is always better that they are solo, but it is painful to watch them come right after the Orioles took a three run lead.\xc2\xa0 Also, the approach by several hitters was off tonight.\xc2\xa0 Nick Markakis decided he wanted to swing at the first pitch he saw from Tanaka in each at-bat. Because of it, he saw an average of less than two pitches an at-bat.\xc2\xa0 That is awful coming from your leadoff hitter.\xc2\xa0 Also, Tanaka used his nasty splitter to strike out the Orioles ten times, and several of those were on ugly at-bats.\xc2\xa0 None more so than Chris Davis, who with a man on swung at two pitches that bounced around the plate and then struck out looking.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it was only Steve Lombardozzi and Ryan Flaherty who did not strike out in the game.\xc2\xa0 The save wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly clean or pretty, but it ended up alright!What\xe2\x80\x99s NEXT: The Orioles get an off-day on Thursday before they come back to Baltimore to take on the Toronto Blue Jays (5-4 and play the Astros tomorrow at 7 p.m.) The matchup will feature Dustin McGowan vs. Bud Norris, at least that is who I expect to start.\xc2\xa0 Neither one looked good in their first starts, as both have ERAs of 9 and over.\xc2\xa0 As of writing this, the Jays are in the lead in the AL East, and are the only team over .500.\xc2\xa0 Which is surprising, considering that their team statistics are not good for either the hitters or the pitchers.

That caliber of pitcher, Jones said, was the standard Tanaka now faces in the American League, and particularly in the East, where all the teams look dangerous.Cruz, who played with Yu Darvish in Texas, said it was too early to compare Tanaka to Darvish. The Orioles were more comfortable comparing Tanaka to another Yankee, Hiroki Kuroda.

(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun)MoreNEW YORK (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Masahiro Tanaka made Adam Jones look silly in his first two at-bats. Still, the All-Star center fielder who is always at the ready with a not-so-safe opinion wasn\'t all that impressed by the young Japanese pitcher.Nick Markakis had an RBI single in the ninth inning against fill-in closer Shawn Kelley, and the Baltimore Orioles rallied for a 5-4 victory Wednesday night over the New York Yankees after wasting a three-run lead against Tanaka.""We\'re not the same hitters he faced over there. We groove, we hack,"" said Jones, who struck out twice before getting a single in his three at-bats off Tanaka.Jonathan Schoop hit a soaring three-run homer off Tanaka in the second inning of the right-hander\'s first start at Yankee Stadium but Carlos Beltran and Kelly Johnson connected against Miguel Gonzalez in the bottom of the inning. Alfonso Soriano tied it with a groundout in the fourth.""He just made a mistake, kept a slider up,"" Schoop said. ""I tried to make adjustments as he tried to elevate me, and then he made a mistake.""The Orioles, who managed only seven hits while striking out 10 times against Tanaka in seven innings, lined four straight hits to center field off Kelley, pitching the ninth for the second time in place of the injured David Robertson.Ryan Flaherty and Schoop each lined 0-2 pitches from Kelley (0-1) and Markakis singled in Flaherty and, after Delmon Young got his third hit of the night, Chris Davis made it 5-3 with a sacrifice fly.""I felt like they did a good job getting the barrel to some good pitches,"" Kelly said. ""If I bounced some of those balls, maybe they\'re swing and misses.""Tommy Hunter gave up two hits to start the ninth and a sacrifice fly to former Oriole Brian Roberts before getting Yangervis Solarte to ground into a double play for his third save, finishing off the Orioles\' second straight win over New York. Brian Matusz got two outs (1-0). Matusz has stranded 51 of 56 inherited runners dating to 2012, a major league best.""It\'s not always going to be pretty, you just look at the result,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.Jones came up to a smattering of boos before his first at-bat a day after he said, ""They should let us have a shot to kick \'em with our metal spikes,"" about two fans who ran on the field Tuesday. The fans\' shenanigans got a huge cheer from the crowd.Jones fanned his first two times up to hardy cheers. Jones wasn\'t alone. Tanaka had the Orioles flailing at his nasty split-fingered fastball all night, many bouncing in the dirt.""He is as good as advertised,"" Showalter said of Tanaka.There were many empty seats on a brisk night in the Bronx despite it being New York\'s first chance to see the prized Tanaka, who signed a seven-year, $155 million contract with the Yankees this winter \xe2\x80\x94 plus a $20 million rights fee paid to his team in Japan, Ratuken.Tanaka warmed up to the bubbly ""My Dear Fellow,"" a song written for the 25-year-old pitcher by the Japanese group Momoiro Clover Z. He then received a rude welcome from Markakis. The Orioles leadoff batter grounded the first pitch of the game right back at Tanaka, hitting him on the foot before it deflected to shortstop Derek Jeter, who made the throw for the out.In similar fashion to his first big league start at Toronto, Tanaka was tagged early before settling in.He gave up three runs \xe2\x80\x94 two earned \xe2\x80\x94 in the first two innings Friday of a seven-inning outing in which he struck out eight. This time, Schoop hit a soaring three-run homer high above the left field pole in the second inning.But Tanaka gave up just three more singles and a walk.Gonzalez was equal to the task, allowing seven hits and three runs. He walked one and struck out three.NOTES: Tanaka\'s walk of Wieters in the third snapped a streak of five straight games in which the Yankees\' starter did not allow a walk. ...

Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles pulled off a significant 5-4 win last night in the get-away game of their first series in New York, giving them a series win 2-1. In 2013, the Orioles lost 2-of-3 in each of their three visits to the Big Apple. And winning a game started by the platinum-armed Masahiro Tanaka is no small prize either.Jonathan Schoop had the biggest swing of the game with a three-run shot off Tanaka in the 2nd inning. This gave the Orioles a 3-0 lead that Miguel Gonzalez would give back by the time he was done after six innings. Tanaka made it through seven frames, giving up only the three runs on Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s bomb, while striking out 10. Masahiro is good, but he is very beatable by a patient team.The most critical of the O\xe2\x80\x99s 12 hits on the evening came from Ryan Flaherty leading off the top of the 9th inning. He \xe2\x80\x9cwent down and got\xe2\x80\x9d a low-outside pitch and drove it into right-center field, hustling his way into second base with a head-first slide. He would later score the go-ahead run on a Markakis single, while Schoop \xe2\x80\x93 who had singled in between them \xe2\x80\x93 would score the critical insurance run on a sac fly by Chris Davis.The fifth run would prove to be necessary, as the Yankees \xe2\x80\x93 no matter who plays for them or what year it is \xe2\x80\x93 always put runners on in the 9th inning and often score them. On this evening, they would manage a single run in the final frame, scoring only the leadoff double by Alphonso Soriano.The most critical pitching performance by the Orioles was that of Brian Matusz, who came on in the bottom of the 8th inning with a Yankees runner at third base and one out. He induced a pop-up out from the tough Jacoby Ellsbury, and after an intentional walk of Carlos Beltran got Brian McCann to fly out easily to center fielder Adam Jones. Matusz got the official win \xe2\x80\x93 very good!Tommy Hunter got the official save \xe2\x80\x93 oh boy! I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of confidence in this Tommy Hunter as closer situation, though, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t many pitchers anywhere who would make me feel confident in 9th innings (but still wish the O\xe2\x80\x99s would have gotten Koji Uehara before last year.) But at the same time, I\xe2\x80\x99m not wishing for Jim Johnson back. Right now his ERA is 18.90 in 5 games for the A\xe2\x80\x99s, where he has an 0-2 record, having given up 9 hits and 6 BB in only 3.1 innings. His WHIP is 4.50, which I did not think was humanly possible. Opponents are hitting .529. Yes, it is early.Again, looking back to Ryan Flaherty \xe2\x80\x93 it was a foregone conclusion throughout the offseason that he would be the regular Orioles second baseman. I was amazed at the popular support for him by O\xe2\x80\x99s fans. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve therefore been amazed equally, though probably should not be, at how quickly the fanbase turned on him with his terribly slow start to this season (discounting these past two games). I am not \xe2\x80\x9cdown\xe2\x80\x9d on Flaherty. I think he is a plus defender, but over the long-haul is a less than sufficient offensive threat. He has some nice power and is a terrific extra bench player because of his defensive versatility. That is how I see him eventually for the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 the super utility man, who could maybe be the best in the league for that role.One more paragraph of thoughts, observations and opinions \xe2\x80\x93 Miguel Gonzalez will get credit for a quality start tonight. To get a quality start, all you need to be is a 4.50 ERA pitcher \xe2\x80\xa6 which by definition is a guy who can keep you in the game long enough to give your team a shot to win. And that is what he did tonight. It could have been worse; the game could have gotten away from him completely after giving up two solo homers in the 2nd inning and ultimately blowing a 3-0 lead. But one of the most respectable things about Gonzalez is his calm but fierce competitiveness. He does not have high-end talent; he is getting the most out of what he has to give \xe2\x80\xa6 gotta love and respect that. Honestly, his fastball was not good tonight. It is not good enough on any night to get away with any mistakes in the heart of the plate. There is no margin for error. He commanded it a bit better as the game went on, but more than that, he mixed in more off-speed pitches. There were not enough earlier in the contest, and the Yankees were sitting on his (frankly speaking) sub-par fastball. His last pitch of the game was his best \xe2\x80\x93 he froze Soriano on a crisp breaking pitch. And that is what Gonzalez must do to remain a part of this rotation.All in all, any win over the Yankees is sweet. There is no game today, as the Orioles have managed to win three of the past four games and pull out of their early-season 1-4 tail-spin. Toronto comes to town for a weekend series.

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY SportsFrom time to time over the course of the season, here at The Baltimore Wire we will give some updates on the pitching rotations at AAA Norfolk and AA Bowie. In that pitching is such a big and critical part of the game of baseball, it is always good to be able to know what is just over the horizon in terms of future prospects to take the mound for the Baltimore Orioles.The system-wide emphasis on pitching is seen extending to the AA affiliate in Bowie, Maryland, where pitching coach Blaine Beatty has some great young arms to work with. Beyond that, Dylan Bundy could well be re-entering the sport through the Bowie Baysox before too long.Currently through seven games, Bowie is 5-2, with three of the top prospects in the Orioles system are a part of the current rotation \xe2\x80\xa6#3 prospect Eduardo Rodriguez \xe2\x80\x93 has been off to a bit of a rough start in his two games so far. He has given up four earned runs over five innings in both of his starts. Hopes are high for the young man who is still only age 21. He made it to Bowie at the end of last season, pitched especially well in Arizona for the fall league, and looked impressive in spring training big league camp.#6 prospect Tim Berry \xe2\x80\x93 Buck Showalter can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to stop talking about how impressed he is with the 23-year-old. Taken in the 50th round, he has already been through arm problems and Tommy John surgery \xe2\x80\x93 hence his low placement in the draft. His first outing was a fantastic seven innings of three-hit baseball. \xe2\x80\x9cThe change-up was working for me today,\xe2\x80\x9d Berry said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was commanding it well and it had better action than it usually has. You mix that with the fastball and that\xe2\x80\x99s really all you need to keep hitters off balance. My curveball I just kind of sprinkled in.\xe2\x80\x9d#11 prospect Zach Davies \xe2\x80\x93 Bowie pitching coach Blaine Beatty told me before spring training started that he was especially excited to work with Davies this year. Also at age 21, Davies is unusual for pitching prospects because of his size \xe2\x80\x93 listed at 6-0 and 150 pounds. He was a 26th-round pick in 2011, but has great control of his pitches. His first game was reasonably good with only two runs in five innings. This is his first shot at the AA level.Jake Pettit had a difficult start in his first outing, as the first five batters he faced hit five consecutive singles. He did manage to hold the damage to a total of four runs over four innings. Pettit is a career minor leaguer in the Orioles organization who has thrown a total of 491 innings with a 36-21 record and 3.77 ERA. He was a 42nd-round pick in 2010.Tyler Wilson threw six shutouts innings in his first start, giving up only three hits. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially in your first start of the year, it\xe2\x80\x99s great to get out there and get those nerves out of the way,\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou really want to find your rhythm early on, no matter what start, but especially in the first start of the year.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Wilson is a 2011 selection of the Orioles in the 10th round out of UVA. Now age 24, he spent most of last season with Bowie as he works through the O\xe2\x80\x99s farm system.Also getting a start was 27-year-old Matt Bischoff, a pitcher who spent most of 2013 with the Baysox, appearing in 25 games \xe2\x80\x93 all but one in relief. He was originally drafted by the Mariners out of Purdue University. He is a minor league free agent that was signed by the Orioles in January, 2012.

Things went wrong for the team after he came out of the game. He gave up one earned run in five innings, but since the runner reached on his own error we\'ll still hold it against him. Other than that he was decent with five singles, one walk, and one HBP allowed in five innings. He struck out four and had a 4/5 GO/FO. Wright was followed by Tim Alderson, Kelvin De La Cruz, and Brock Hutzinger, each of whom gave up one run. 3B David Adams homered for the Tides and DH Brett Wallace doubled. No Tide had more than one hit. The Gwinnett Braves not only won the game, but they won the awesome name contest with gems like Joey Terdoslavich and Wirfin Obespo on their roster.    Bowie Baysox 1, Richmond Flying Squirrels 5 Eduardo Rodriguez, the O\'s #3 prospect, made his second start this season and while the game started off fantastically, wasn\'t able to repeat and was out after five innings and 99 pitches thrown. Rodriguez  retired the first nine batters he faced with six ground outs and two strikeouts. He gave up two runs in the fourth inning on a single and two doubles, all three marked ""line drive"" in the play log. In the fifth inning, Rodriguez struck out the first two batters he faced, but after a double, a walk, and a double steal, both runners came in on a single. The Squirrels had three stolen bases with Rodriguez on the mound, but that probably had more to do with who was behind the plate.    The Baysox hitters were kept off the board until the eighth inning as Squirrels\' starter Ty Blach held them to five singles and walk over six innings. In the eighth inning the table was set by big-brothers-of-current-Orioles Buck Britton, who singled, and Sharlon Schoop, who walked. With two outs, CF Dariel Alvarez singled in Britton and catcher Michael Ohlman walked to load the bases, but RF Chih-Hsien Chiang popped out to end the rally. The Baysox didn\'t have an extra base hit in the game, though both Christian Walker and Ohlman had two hits each, with Ohlman also taking two walks.    Frederick Keys 2, Carolina Mud Cats 9 Things weren\'t pretty for starting pitcher Parker Bridwell in this game, though his defense wasn\'t exactly there for him. After giving up three runs through four innings, things fell apart in the fifth. After three singles and a triple (with a fielding error by the LF in the middle) he was pulled from the game. Overall he gave up 7 runs, 6 earned on 10 hits. He also hit a guy and got exactly zero outs via ground ball. The silver lining is that he struck out six with no walks, but the hitters obviously saw no need to be patient against him. The Keys offense had just six hits and two walks on the night. Only CF Glynn Davis had more than one hit, with two singles, but 2B Sammie Starr doubled and walked. LF Michael Burgess singled and walked. Adrian Marin knocked in a run with a ground out and Burgess had the other RBI with a single in the eighth. Very recent Orioles farmhand Torsten Boss faced his old team tonight. He went 0-for-5 with two strikeouts.    Delmarva Shorebirds 5, Hagerstown Suns 3 11th round draft pick Steven Brault started last night\'s game for the Shorebirds and gave up two runs on seven hits in six innings. He didn\'t walk a batter, had seven strikeouts, and was about 50/50 in ground outs to fly outs. It was a much better showing than his first start of the year in which he gave up six runs in just four innings. The Shorebirds offense got four runs off of the Suns starter Austin Voth in 4 2/3 innings, then got one more in the eighth. 3B Drew Dosch had a single, a double, and walk. DH Conor Bierfeldt didn\'t get a hit but he walked twice. Second baseman Anthony Caronia had the biggest day of all with a single, two doubles, and a walk.

', 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""Perspective on Orioles' slow start - Camden Chat"", "" After a rollercoaster offseason, one in which the club traded away baseball's save leader before redeeming itself with late season acquisitions, fans were optimistic that Oriole Magic would return to Camden Yards once again. However, a slow start to the season has brought a sense of urgency to the Baltimore faithful. While still early, if the Orioles are to recapture the magic and return to the playoffs for the second time in three years, the following circumstances must fall in their favor. Schedule As I noted last week, the month of April is statistically the most difficult month of the season for the Birds. In fact, the Orioles' entire schedule is widely-considered the toughest in baseball. Over the first two series, the O's managed only two wins against the American League's best, Boston and Detroit. Outside of two stellar outings from starter Chris Tillman, the Orioles' pitching staff struggled against the two best offenses in the American League. Over the six-game stretch, the staff allowed 28 runs on 68 hits, a recipe for disaster. On the bright side, the schedule seemed to have lightened up as the O's traveled to New York. Ranked among the worst teams in many offensive categories in 2013, the Orioles hoped the Yankees would provide a lessened-challenge than their previous opponents. While the opening game of the series did not go as planned, a 4-2 loss, solid starts from Wei-Yin Chen and Miguel Gonzalez in the final two matchups gave the Orioles their first series win of the season.    The schedule fails to become easier in the foreseeable future, as the Orioles continue their string of six-consecutive divisional opponents with visits from the Blue Jays and Rays, before traveling to Boston for the first time this season. Not to mention, of their remaining opponents this month, all but the Royals finished in the top half of the league in offensive efficiency. Luckily, the rest of the division has had an equally difficult start to the season, with the Orioles a mere game out of first place.      April 2014 2013 Record   Red Sox 97-65   at Tigers  93-69   at Yankees 85-77   Blue Jays 74-88   Rays 92-71   at Red Sox 97-65   at Blue Jays 74-88   Royals 86-76   Pirates 94-68   Offensive Woes The only way for the Orioles to manage such a schedule is for the team to match its own offensive output from a season ago. Until Tuesday's breakout against the Yankees, the Orioles had managed only 22 runs over 7 games. A measly three runs a game will not win many games, no matter how many aces you have on staff. On Tuesday, however, the Orioles showed glimpses of the offensive firepower fans long for in their 14-5 victory over the Yankees. The 20 hits recorded were by far a season high, but the offense seemed to relapse in the series finale. Outside of a three-run shot from Jonathan Schoop in the second inning and a two-run ninth, Wednesday night's output was similar to the first seven games of the season.    Some Orioles, specifically first baseman Chris Davis, will have a tough time equaling their offensive production from a season ago, simply due to regression to the mean. Davis, who crushed a career-high 53 home runs in 2013, has yet to hit one out of the park this season. In comparison, Davis hit six homeruns in the same nine-game span one year ago. With such high expectations, Davis will likely field most of the blame for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lack of offensive production, but in reality, roughly 35 home runs for Davis should be welcomed by O\xe2\x80\x99s fans. If the series against the Yankees is any indication of an offensive breakout for the Birds, expect some fireworks in the upcoming matchups with Toronto and Tampa Bay. In fact, Davis\xe2\x80\x99 historic 2013 season kicked off with three-consecutive games with a homerun against the Rays. Missing Machado In the thick of the playoff race in early August, 2012, the Orioles put all their chips on the table and promoted top-prospect Manny Machado from Double-A. Since journeymen Mark Reynolds and Wilson Betemit struggled to lock down the hot corner, the Orioles front office felt that the franchise\xe2\x80\x99s future was now.    With the 20-year-old from Miami in the lineup, the Orioles would finish the season with a 93-69 record and make the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. Although the youngster was tasked with playing third base instead of his natural shortstop position, Machado\xe2\x80\x99s glove and timely hitting lead the Orioles to a 33-18 record down the stretch. Showing flashes of Brooks Robinson on the corner, Machado won his first-career Gold Glove award in 2013, also receiving the Platinum Glove award as the best overall defender in the American League. Unfortunately, the 2013 season ended abruptly for Machado when he suffered a torn medial patellofemoral ligament in his left knee as he was running out a single and awkwardly stepped on first base. Machado originally feared that the injury was career-threatening, but thanks to a successful surgery and a strict rehab regiment, he has been participating in baseball activities in recent weeks. Although he was placed on the 15-day disabled list to start the season, Machado is now eligible to come off when called upon. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s unknown whether Machado will need or request a rehab stint in the minor leagues before returning to the big league club. What we do know is that when Machado returns, the job is his. In the meantime, however, manager Buck Showalter has had to shuffle players at the hot corner. Former Rule 5 pickup Ryan Flaherty, although a regular at second base, has taken his fair share of grounders at third, while prospect Jonathan Schoop has also made appearances, leaving recent pickup Steve Lombardozzi to fill in at second base. Flaherty has also played shortstop in relief of JJ Hardy, who has suffered from back spasms in recent days. While the fill-ins try to replicate Machado\xe2\x80\x99s production, it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that the Orioles miss their young superstar. In recent days, both Schoop and Lombardozzi have made costly baserunning mistakes, something Machado's maturity beyond his age would not allow him to do. In close contests with the Yankees on consecutive days, both Schoop and Lombardozzi were picked off at second base. Even though neither factored into the final tally, scoring opportunities are not something that the Orioles can give away, as their downfall a season ago was batting average with runners in scoring position. Defensively, Machado\xe2\x80\x99s absence is also evident. In the same game that he was picked-off at second base for leading too far, Schoop was out of position at third and allowed a double down the line to lead off an inning. Again, this mistake did not affect the outcome, as the Orioles had a significant lead at the time, but such an error can and will hurt a team in crunch time. While his range may be limited from his injury, it is likely that Machado would have made the diving stop and made SportsCenter\xe2\x80\x99s Top Plays that night.    In 2012, Machado was statistically better than the players he replaced, averaging 2.8 assists and putouts per nine innings, compared to the 2.15 from Reynolds and Betemit. Additionally, Machado was responsible for only four errors in 47 games, while others committed 24 errors over 115 games. It can only be assumed that Machado\xe2\x80\x99s return will have a similar effect on this year\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles, who desperately need the superstar to return to his pre-injury form. Outlook While the schedule continues to be a hassle, as is expected in the toughest division in baseball, the Orioles have reason for optimism. A series win over the Yankees, which included a breakout performance from designated hitter Delmon Young and the rest of the offense, will give the squad confidence as they return to Camden Yards for a pair of divisional matchups. It may have taken two weeks into the season, but it seems as if the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bats have arrived from Sarasota and are here to stay. If the offensive output can outshine the struggles on defense until Manny Machado and JJ Hardy can return to health, the Orioles should remain in contention for a division crown. As for Machado, according to multiple reports, he has been jogging on a pool treadmill, but has yet to resume running bases. Machado has previously told reporters that he won\xe2\x80\x99t return until his knee is 100%, which could take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. On the bright side, Machado will return this season, giving the Orioles a much needed boost at the plate and in the field. If his return can mimic his promotion in 2012, nobody will remember the subpar start to the season.

04/11/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The ballpark experience - Birds Watcher', 'Yesterday for the first time since March 30th, the Baltimore Orioles were off. But don\xe2\x80\x99t worry; the Birds are back in action tonight back at the yard against Toronto! In monitoring the first two weeks of league play, 0ne thing across Major League Baseball that\xe2\x80\x99s struck me is that there have been a few complaints about the experience at the ballpark. The O\xe2\x80\x99s have only played three games at home to this point, however I think that most people around here would agree that fans know what they\xe2\x80\x99re getting when they buy a ticket to Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Overall, I think that most fans would agree that not only\xc2\xa0is the in-game experience good in Baltimore, but that it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten better.But in reading various columns and even fan boards, I see a general level of contempt from fans across the league when they go to MLB games. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s long lines at the concession stands, bathrooms, ticket windows, etc., customer service issues, or anything else, it appears that teams are doing a better job of getting under fans\xe2\x80\x99 skin. So what gives? What should be done about this, and/or what can be done?This is always a tough sell because people come at this type of thing from different vantage points. However one common denominator I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in fan complaints is long lines at concession stands. Those types of things are universally seen as bad. Part of the problem is that many teams/vendor companies can\xe2\x80\x99t accurately predict what their attendance is going to be game in and game out. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to say that attendance is going to be lower in months such as April or September, or higher in general on weekends. However it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to gauge what kind of walk-up crowd a game is going to draw. So if they\xe2\x80\x99re expecting 15K and the game ends up drawing a huge walk-up crowd, odds are that staffing levels at concession stands, souvenir shops, etc. will be lower than necessary which will provide for longer waits.Unfortunately the age of the game itself being the only draw is probably over. For so many years fans would flock to Memorial Stadium \xe2\x80\x93 just to watch the game. But now with the concept of the \xe2\x80\x9cballpark experience,\xe2\x80\x9d people look for more than that. Again, for the most part I think that the Orioles do a good job with this. Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a casual fan or a die hard, one thing that is necessary is customer service. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about someone having to wait 20 minutes for a hot dog, I\xe2\x80\x99m referring more to just the overall attitude of the workers at the park. If ushers are rude or cop attitudes with fans, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to dissuade people from coming back. Granted when you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with the general public that\xe2\x80\x99s not always easy, however believe it or not that might well be the easiest part of improving the ballpark experience.Going back to lines at the concession stands for a moment, many of the newer parks actually have open concourses now (Nationals Park in Washington, along with Harbor Park in Norfolk \xe2\x80\x93 home of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 triple-A team \xe2\x80\x93 are two examples). While it\xe2\x80\x99s not perfect, that might help to alleviate some of the \xe2\x80\x9cpain\xe2\x80\x9d for fans associated with missing part of the game. Granted I remember when it was novel to have televisions or the radio feed pipped into the concourse, however the fact is that\xe2\x80\x99s no longer good enough. Fans pay to see the game in person, not on TV in the concourse area.Courtesy of Bob DeChiara-US PRESSWIREUltimately teams probably need to take a look at how their gameday experience operates across the board. It\xe2\x80\x99s also worthwhile for executives to take in games as fans at other parks, just to see if they can catch onto things that other teams are doing and so forth. This is not to say that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t already happen, however it\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad idea. I say all of this fully recognizing that in some cases people\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions can be based on things beyond the team or anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s control. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard fans in other sports complainin that \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xc2\xa0[insert team name]\xc2\xa0need to do something about the construction on the roads outside the stadium. That makes it much more difficult to get to the game.\xe2\x80\x9d Common sense people. Having said that, attitudes as such just illustrate why teams need to do their best to perfect things that they\xc2\xa0can\xc2\xa0control.The Orioles return home tonight to open up a six-game homestand with Toronto in for the weekend. Buck Showalter reshuffled his rotation a bit, which he was able to do given the team\xe2\x80\x99s off day yesterday. Chris Tillman will get the start tonight on normal rest following his gem of a game last Sunday in Detroit. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Dustin McGowan of Toronto. The hope is that J.J. Hardy will be back in the lineup tonight after missing four games with neck spasms. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Chris Tillman Looks to get Orioles Back to Even', '\xc2\xa0Apr 6, 2014; Detroit, MI, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Chris Tillman (30) pitches against the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsAfter Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s off day, the season continues on Friday evening with game 10 against the Toronto Blue Jays. The Baltimore Orioles have won three of the past four games to pull themselves to a record of 4-5 in the AL East, where all five teams are within a game of each other. The Orioles will look to improve upon their 10-9 record against the Jays in 2013.The day off allows the Orioles to pitch Chris Tillman in the opening game of the series on his normal five-day schedule. Bud Norris will bump back with two extra days and pitch on Saturday, while Ubaldo Jimenez goes Sunday with one extra day.The most recent two games in New York seemed to feature the rediscovery of the Orioles offense, and that makes all the difference. The bottom of the order has been especially effective, and I suppose that any team that had their 7-8-9 hitters go 12-for-27 over a two-day period is going to have a lot of success.It is also presumed that J.J. Hardy will likely be recovered sufficiently from his back spasm issues to play again, and likewise David Lough has hopefully put the concussion-like symptoms behind him and can play at a high level.The Orioles will be facing Toronto hurler Dustin McGowan in the first game of the series. Other than Adam Jones being 4-for-5 off him, there is not much else in terms of optimistic numbers \xe2\x80\xa6 though few have faced him many times.

Steinbrenner Field. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsFrom time to time over the course of the season, here at The Baltimore Wire we will give some updates on the pitching rotations at AAA Norfolk and AA Bowie. In that pitching is such a big and critical part of the game of baseball, it is always good to be able to know what is just over the horizon in terms of future prospects to take the mound for the Baltimore Orioles.It has been presumed that the Orioles are rather well-armed with high-level pitching prospects and that the AAA Norfolk rotation was going to be rather outstanding. So far, that has been a mixed bag of results. The team is not hitting particularly well other than Jemile Weeks and Caleb Joseph, and they are off to a 3-5 start through the first eight games. (Caleb Joseph had a 12th-inning two-run double last night to make a winner out of newly-acquired pitcher Preston Guilmet.)Tides manager Ron Johnson stated at the beginning of the season that his rotation was going to go in this order: Kevin Gausman, Steve Johnson, T.J. McFarland, Suk-min Yoon, and Mike Wright. This plan was upset before it even started, as weather uncertainties in Detroit caused fears of a possible Orioles-Tigers double header last Saturday (which did not eventuate) and Gausman was pulled from the opener to head toward Michigan. Eddie Gamboa made the start for Norfolk instead. He pitched well, allowing two runs in five innings \xe2\x80\x93 those runs coming on a two-run homer with two outs in the 5th inning. We\xe2\x80\x99ll mention Gamboa again later.Of the starting rotation so far this year \xe2\x80\xa6Kevin Gausman \xe2\x80\x93 Considered the #2 Orioles prospect, he is clearly on a strict pitch count around 70-75. His first start went 4.2 scoreless innings with three hits, two walks, and six strikeouts. His second start was more difficult with two earned runs over four innings with four hits and two walks.Steve Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 He threw 55 pitches in his first outing, doing so over three innings with three hits and a run given up. His second outing on Friday night was more difficult. In 4.2 innings he was touched up for four runs on four hits \xe2\x80\x93 two of them homers, raising his ERA to 5.87.T.J. McFarland \xe2\x80\x93 The Orioles Rule 5 draftee from last year had a very good first start and will pitch again Saturday. Over four innings he gave up one run on four hits, while striking out five.Suk-min Yoon \xe2\x80\x93 This is not encouraging. Lasting only 2.1 innings, Gwinnett got to him for nine earned runs on 11 hits. That translates to a 34.71 ERA. Hopefully he had food poisoning or something like that affecting him. My readers may recall that I have not been an optimistic person about Yoon, though I want to be terribly wrong about my fears. Eddie Gamboa game into the game and went 5.2 scoreless innings to bring things under control. As you can see in the chart below, Gamboa now has an ERA of 1.69.David Wright \xe2\x80\x93 The Orioles Minor League Pitcher of the Year in 2013 had a very strong first start, going five innings and giving up but one run on five hits.

Starting pitcher Steve Johnson was less than great, giving up four runs in 4 2/3 innings. He only walked one, but gave up two home runs. Chris Jones surrendered the other two runs in two innings following Johnson. They were followed by scoreless outings by Brock Hutzinger, Kelvin De La Cruz, and new-to-the-organization Preston Guilmet. Guilmet was impressive, with two perfect innings and four strikeouts. On offense, it was a big day Julio Borbon, who was 3-for-4 with a double, a triple, and two walks, and Quintin Berry, who was 3-for-5 with a home run. Xavier Paul also homered in the win. The Tides and Knights play again this evening at 7 p.m. with T.J. McFarland as the starting pitcher. Bowie Baysox 1, Akron Aeros 2 (13) The Baysox and Aeros took a 1-1 tie into the bottom of the 13th inning when relief pitcher Chris Petrini, who had already pitched two good innings, gave up a walk-off home run to the first batter he faced. Tim Berry started the game for the Baysox and gave up on run in five innings. It wasn't a particularly efficient night for Berry, with 93 pitches thrown and two walks allowed. Jason Gurka and Juan Morillo followed with a combination of five scoreless innings.    The Baysox scored just one run despite racking up eight hits and five walks on the night. SS Niuman Romero had two hits and two walks, and 1B Christian Walker also had a two-hit game. DH Michael Ohlman went 0-for4 with a walk, and CF Dariel Alvarez doubled.    Zach Davies will take the mound this afternoon against the Aeros at 2:05. Frederick Keys 0, Lynchburg Hillcats 1 It was a pitchers' duel in Frederick, featuring a good night by starting pitcher Brady Wager. In six innings, Wager gave up one run on five hits. His big mistake was a solo home run in the second inning. Wager had two walks and five strikeouts, and an outstanding 10/1 GO/FO ratio. Matt Hobgood pitched the final three innings of the game. He didn't give up a hit but he walked two and struck out five.    The Keys' offense had just six hits, all singles. CF Glynn Davis and C Wynston Sawyer had two hits each and the other two were from RF Brenden Webb and DH Joel Hutter. The Keys will be home tonight but the starting pitcher is still TBD. Delmarva Shorebirds 3, Greensboro Grasshoppers 6 (10) The Shorebirds and Grasshoppers had a 1-1 tie going into the ninth inning, but things got wild in the 9th and 10th innings. Each team put up one run in the ninth inning, but the Grasshoppers' four-run tenth was too much for the Shorebirds to overcome.    Mitch Horacek pitched seven innings for the Shorebirds with just one run allowed. He walked two and struck out three. David Richardson pitched two innings following that and gave up one run in the ninth. Dennis Torres took the loss with a terrible 10th inning, giving up four runs on five hits. The Shorebirds collected six hits and four walks on the night, including doubles by Mike Yaztrzemski, Jeff Kemp, and Drew Dosch.

The statistics from that time show amazingly low numbers for pitching ERA, with correspondingly low numbers for top batting averages.In 1968, the average total runs-per-game was 6.8, compared to about 8.5 in recent years.

John (CHW) 2.62\xc2\xa0Here is my point: I grew up loving baseball at a time when it was more of a low-scoring, pitchers battle \xe2\x80\xa6 where 1-0 and 2-1 games were much more common. After the \xe2\x80\x9968 season it was so much this way that the pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s mound was lowered from 15 inches to 10 inches in order to take away the huge pitching advantage.So, these past two Orioles games \xe2\x80\x93 a 2-0 loss with unearned runs scored against them, and last night\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1, 12-inning win \xe2\x80\x93 look and feel a lot more like the 1960s than the current era \xe2\x80\xa6 though understand, I\xe2\x80\x99m not craving any return to those days!The Baltimore Orioles had the Blue Jays down to their final strike last night, and in fact it was after the final uncalled strike on a (non) check swing, by Colby Rasmus. The fans were standing, having gathered their belongings in the 9th inning with the Orioles winning 1-0, when Rasmus turned around a Tommy Hunter 97-mph fast ball and put it over the fence.Fortunately a triple by Steve Lombardozzi put him at third base with one in the bottom of the 12th out so that David Lough could single him home for the 2-1 victory.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how many people noticed on the replay of the triple that the Orioles finally got a break. The ball hit on a seam between two outfield panels and bounced oddly to the side rather than straight back at the outfielder. Lombo saw this and kicked into an extra gear for the critical extra base.More 60s-like baseball \xe2\x80\x93 where every base counts!Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Ubaldo Battles BuehrleThis afternoon, Toronto will send 35-year-old Mark Buehrle to the mound.

04/14/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Time for a Buck Showalter Clubhouse Rant?', 'Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsI\xe2\x80\x99ll just say it up front: the Toronto series this past weekend was the most poorly-played set of games I have witnessed out of a Baltimore Orioles team in the Showalter era.It was more than just the throwing errors that threw away the first game, or the combined 3-for-20 with runners in scoring position (and even one of those three hits did not actually score a run) or the combined five runs in 30 innings.Rather, it was a collection of the other little things that make a difference \xe2\x80\x93 the negative things the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t generally do, or the intangible extra things they generally get done that many others would not.Twice, outfielders \xe2\x80\x9ccircled their way\xe2\x80\x9d casually to get a base hit, allowing the batter to get an extra base. Pitches got away from catchers, throws were off line or missed the cutoff.I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the sudden conservative base-running approach when scoring is at such a premium. I don\xe2\x80\x99t get the pitch selection that has a third-pitch fastball down the middle after the hitter was completely unable to handle two off-speed pitches.This Toronto team, as currently constructed, is not honestly a great outfit. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll give them tons of credit. Colby Rasmus had an amazing series. But beyond that, they could make a whole highlight reel of defensive gems simply from this series. They looked quick, light, and competitive. The Orioles appeared tired, heavy-footed, and going through motions. It simply looked like the guys in blue were the guys we normally see in orange and black.I love Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s style of managing \xe2\x80\x93 the personable, encouraging approach that works to bring out the best in another person. It is the way I did it in my high school coaching career. I believe it is the way to gain the highest level of group human performance. But even so, there comes a time once in a while to go off on a rant when the atmosphere seems to have made a categorical change \xe2\x80\x93 like when the other team looks more like you than you look like you.If you get beat simply because the other team is better, well \xe2\x80\xa6 cool \xe2\x80\xa6 they\xe2\x80\x99re better at least on that day. But the Blue Jays are not better. Their pitching \xe2\x80\x93 even Buehrle yesterday \xe2\x80\x93 is not that great compared to other teams that will be seen. The Orioles were 22-for-108 (.204) in the series.So, if Showalter chooses to take off on a rant, we\xe2\x80\x99ll not hear about it from outside the clubhouse, and that is good. It just seems like maybe it is a time for such to happen.OK\xe2\x80\xa6 enough ranting from me \xe2\x80\xa6 let\xe2\x80\x99s look ahead to the Tampa Bay series and to the opening game this evening.Orioles / Rays PreviewThe Rays have had a number of pitching injuries and set-backs this spring, but true to form they always seem to have another young pitcher nearby. One of the rising crop is the young right-hander the Orioles will face tonight \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Archer.Archer will be starting his third game of the season, having thrown two good outings already \xe2\x80\x93 giving up only two runs in six innings against the Blue Jays, and then pitching seven shut-out innings against the Royals. This adds to a 1.38 ERA so far.The Orioles do not have much history against the young hurler. Chris Davis has a homer in four at bats. Machado is 3-for-7, but, he won\xe2\x80\x99t be in the lineup. \xc2\xa0J.J. Hardy is 0-for-7.Baltimore will run Wei-Yin Chen to the mound for the third time as well. Against the Red Sox and Yankees this year, Chen gave up four earned runs in each game \xe2\x80\x93 failing to get through six innings each time.Over his career of eight starts against Tampa Bay, Chen is 2-3 with a very good ERA of 3.04 in 50 innings of pitching. Other than Ben Zobrist\xe2\x80\x99s 10-for-23 (.435) against Chen, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitcher has pretty good numbers against the rest of the Rays lineup\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0ABH2B3BHRRBIBBSOBABen Zobrist2310101315.435Desmond Jennings182100011.111Sean Rodriguez152101222.133Evan Longoria122000013.167Yunel Escobar101100001.100Matthew Joyce41000020.250Jose Molina52100111.400Wil Myers41000011.250\xc2\xa0The Orioles need a win tonight.

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsThe Orioles (5-7) have struggled on both ends of the field so far in 2014. Whether it be pitching or hitting, there is certainly room for improvement as we head into the third week of the season. Many fans feel it is still too early to accurately gauge either side of the field and will argue that there is still plenty of baseball left to play, but I argue that this stretch of disappointing baseball should still be considered significant.Yes, there is plenty of time to turn the ship around. The Orioles could go on a win streak and make fans forget all about the past two weeks. But fans really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget this stretch moving forward, because these problems could pop up periodically throughout the season.Through the first 12 games, Orioles pitchers have a combined 4.50 ERA (13th in AL) and the starters have contributed the most to the struggles.Ubaldo Jimenez (0-3, 7.31), Miguel Gonzalez (0-1, 9.64), and Wei-Yin Chen (1-1, 6.75) have been the weakest links thus far. Most recently Jimenez lasted just 5.1 innings and gave up five earned runs on 10 hits and two walks against the Toronto Blue Jays. The rotation\xe2\x80\x99s struggles, especially Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s, demonstrate the type of struggles the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 rotation is capable of falling into. They could implode at any moment and bring on a losing streak right in the midst of a playoff run, and that has to worry the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 brass.But then again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to win at all if your team doesn\xe2\x80\x99t score runs.\xc2\xa0The Orioles are right in the middle of the AL rankings when it comes to scoring runs, tallying 46 runs (T-7 in AL). Combined with a .256 team AVG (3rd in AL), their numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t seem all too disheartening, but a closer look reveals some early weak spots. In eight of their first 12 games, the Orioles have scored three or less runs. It is hard for any pitcher to win on a team that struggles to get more than three runs in a game.Chris Davis (.279/.353/.419) just hit his first home run on Sunday in a mop-up scenario and has struck out 12 times already, Nick Markakis (.269/.278/.327) has just two extra-base hits and has failed to be an adequate leadoff hitter, and the combination of Jonathan Schoop (.244/.244/.415) and Ryan Flaherty (.152/.200/.212) has failed to give the bottom of the order any stability.Obviously, injuries to J.J Hardy, David Lough and Manny Machado have made for an inconsistent bottom of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 order, and forced some players into positions that they should not be. But the struggles seen so far don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to too many championship-type teams. The Orioles scored just five runs in the entire Blue Jays series, a testament to the type of offensive funk this lineup can fall into in the snap of a finger.The Orioles are far from perfect, yes. Thankfully, most of the teams in the AL East have problems of their own that should help the Orioles from falling too far behind the pack if their struggles continue. However, it is clear that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 hitting and pitching have some serious issues that could create problems at any given point in the season.

I\'m not ashamed to admit it, and even SB Nation\'s Marc Normandin agrees. In this scenario, us O\'s fans are the lucky girlfriend and every other general manager in baseball plays the role of ""jealous girl."" Scoffing at things that don\'t really matter like his strange throwing motion and soul patch. It\'s charming, OK!? OK, has this metaphor gone far enough? Let\'s learn about J.J. Bio Name: James Jerry Hardy Number: 2Born: August 19, 1982 (31 years old) in Tucson, AZHeight: 6\'1""  Weight: 190 lbsBats: Right  Throws: RightDrafted: 2nd Round, 2001 by the Milwaukee BrewersSchool: Sabino High School (Tucson, AZ)Became an Oriole: Traded by the Minnesota Twins along with INF Brendan Harris in exchange for minor league pitchers Brett Jacobson and Jim Hoey on December 9, 2010Walk-up music: ""Flower"" by MobyContract: $7 million for 2014 (becomes free agent after this season) Personal We all know what a stud Hardy is on the field. This winter he had a notable achievement elsewhere. On December 7, 2013 he got married to Adrienne Acton, a former collegiate softball player at the University of Arizona, at a ceremony in Mexico. According to a story done by the Arizona Daily Star late last year, Hardy and Acton are from the same hometown. The newly-minted Mrs. Hardy is three years younger than J.J. However, the two did not discover one another in the Copper State.    When Hardy was a member of the Brewers, his teammates were watching the Women\'s College World Series. Other players on the team noticed where Acton was from and insisted that Hardy get in touch with her. After some convincing he talked to the Brewer\'s public relations department. They contacted the University of Arizona and the rest is history.    Oh, and Hardy has made a well-documented appearance on The Young and the Restless along with, Jeff Suppan, Chris Capuano and former Oriole Bill Hall. Capuano is referred to as ""the best left-handed pitcher in the entire league."" You want to watch this. Professional History After being drafted in 2001, Hardy climbed the organizational ranks with Milwaukee, breaking into the bigs in 2005. While down on the farm the player who some called ""Hoover"" in high school showed every ounce of defensive prowess we see today. He was rated the best defensive infielder and the best infield arm in the Brewer\'s system following the 2004 season. Baseball America ranked Hardy as high as the number 19 prospect in all of baseball.    In his six season with the Brewers, Hardy showed some brilliance. He made his first All-Star game in 2007 at the age of 24. The follow up season of 2008 was even better and, arguably, his best year to date. He managed career highs in batting average (.283) and on base percentage (.343) that year. Hardy struggled after that great 2008. All of his stats took a dive and at one point he was optioned to Triple A. Following the season Hardy was dealt to the Minnesota Twins for outfielder Carlos Gomez. In Minnesota, Hardy couldn\'t find his power in spacious Target Field. On top of that, he injured his wrist and missed 45 games in 2010, which is the reason he still wears a wrist guard running the bases to this day. He played for the Twins at the same time as new Oriole Delmon Young. It was really a forgettable year for the Arizona native.    It was that magical offseason of 2010 when the Orioles solved their longtime hole at shortstop by swapping Jim Hoey and Brett Jacobson for Hardy and fellow infielder Harris. Since this trade, J.J. has had a career rebirth; winning two Gold Gloves, earning another All-Star selection and winning a Silver Slugger award. Scouting Report Those two Gold Gloves aren\'t the only proof that Hardy is a superb defender. FanGraphs gives him a career zone rating per 150 games played at 9.9; that\'s great. But, as anyone who follows the Orioles can tell you, Hardy\'s foot speed is well below average. He will make the occasional spectacular play, but what makes him great is that he is almost assuredly going to make the routine play. The best way to describe it is that when a ball is hit to Hardy with two outs, it\'s safe for Adam Jones and Nick Markakis to begin their trek back to the dugout; the out will be recorded. The fact that Hardy plays shortstop makes his bat much more valuable. FanGraphs says that in 2013 AL shortstops had a line of .256/.309/.373. Those numbers are very similar to Hardy\'s career in terms of batting average (.259) and on-base percentage (.312). However, the one tool the Baltimore shortstop has that many of his peers don\'t, aside from Troy Tulowitzski in the NL, is power. Hardy slugged .433 in 2013 with 25 home runs. That was tied for the tops in baseball among shortstops and he wad third in runs batted in. Sure, Hardy has deficiencies at the plate. He doesn\'t walk nearly enough. Perhaps he hits a few too many fly balls. But if his approach changes he would lose what makes him valuable. Many of those fly balls fly right out of the park. The bottom line is that the Orioles are lucky to have a player like Hardy. Award winning shortstops don\'t grow on trees. Remember we were all excited about Luis Hernandez? What\'s Ahead? Hardy has had back issues to begin the 2014 campaign. If those are behind him (apologies for the pun) then he should have another stellar season. His value as a stabilizing force on the infield can\'t be overstated. The question is what uniform will Hardy be wearing come April of 2015.    Reports abound about the Orioles desire to resign the shortstop, but little has been brought up since the beginning of the season. Hardy would be a highly sought after talent if he were to hit free agency. That will only drive his price farther skyward. A certain New York franchise has their own number two retiring this fall. It will come down to the Orioles decision. Hardy has quickly become a fan favorite and has been saying all of the right things about wanting to stay in Baltimore. However, Manny Machado\'s skill set would still seem to fit best at shortstop. Would Hardy be willing to switch to third? As I alluded to above, his value would be greatly diminished if he moved away from short. Much of this will depend on both the health of Machado\'s knee and Hardy\'s back.

Furthermore, do manager arguments not sometimes take two minutes or so?The reason I bring this up is because I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen numerous complaints from fans in terms of the amount of time the system takes. Furthermore, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard complaints regarding things such as the old \xe2\x80\x9cneighborhood play\xe2\x80\x9d at second base among other things. Here\xe2\x80\x99s my take on instant replay: I think it should be expanded. So far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned, the only thing which shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to be reviewed should be balls and strikes. (And even in that case, I\xe2\x80\x99d have no problem with a manager having the ability to challenge whether a hitter checked his swing in time.) So far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned, why not review the neighborhood play? Why not allow a review on whether or not a ball bounced over the bag?One issue that has come up in Oriole games is that there have been calls which have the semblance of being blown, but ultimately there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0conclusive evidence to overturn the call that was made on the field (to use the NFL\xe2\x80\x99s terminology). That\xe2\x80\x99s an inherent flaw in any instant replay system; it\xe2\x80\x99s never going to be 100% foolproof. But so far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned, if you have the ammo you might as well use it.If there\xe2\x80\x99s one criticism that I could make, it would be that in some cases perhaps the conversations are taking a bit too much time. Note that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say the reviews themselves, but the conversations. As it stands right now, managers are allowed to saunter out of the dugout as if on a Sunday afternoon stroll (so that their video guys have the opportunity to look at the play). They\xe2\x80\x99re then given the option of chatting with the umpire for awhile before he finally says\xc2\xa0do you want to challenge? Perhaps the umps need to start asking that question a bit earlier, because it seems like they\xe2\x80\x99re allowing the managers to make the decision in their own time. Either that, or perhaps MLB should put a cap on the amount of time allowed for these chats \xe2\x80\x93 such as 30 seconds or so. We\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about an exact science here, however if people are concerned about how long this is taking perhaps they could re-evaluate that aspect of it.The Orioles and Tampa will conclude their now-truncated series with an afternoon matinee at 12:30 today.

It was the perfect day for a baseball game, and my  first Orioles game since Opening Day over a week prior. As we drove to  the park I contemplated what I\'d get to eat for the first time at Camden  Yards in 2014 (on Opening Day we filled up on Faidley\'s crabcakes prior  to the game). We stopped on Eutaw Street so that my husband could pick  up some bacon on a stick, then headed up to our seats in the upper deck. Not  that hungry, I decided to wait until after the game had begun to get my  dinner, which was my first mistake. In the six months since the 2013  season ended I had forgotten how slow the lines are once the game  starts. As the second inning came to an end I hustled out to the  concourse, hoping to pick something up and be back in my seat before I  missed too much action (it turned out there was very little action at  all in that game, but that\'s another story). I  took only a short glance at the long line for nachos before setting off  to find the perfect combination of good food and short lines. I passed a  few stands before arriving at O What A Dog,  which only had a handful of people waiting. A hot dog, perfect! Why not  start off a season of eating at the ballpark with a classic? I got in  line behind a single man and a group of three teenage girls and looked  up at the TV. Bud Norris had just begun pitching to Brett Lawrie to  start the top of the third inning. I  don\'t know what the lone man at the front of the line was getting, but  it took him forever to complete his transaction. I watched the game on  the TV hanging on the wall and tried not to be annoyed. The three girls  finally stepped up to the counter and ordered three hot dogs and three  cokes. Easy order, right? As they stood there the top of the third  inning came to an end, the TV took a commercial break, and then the  bottom of the third inning started. I was getting frustrated, but I was  so close! I\'d invested too much time in this stupid hot dog to turn back  now.    The  girls finally walked away with their hot dogs and sodas, and it was my  turn. ""One hot dog, please,"" I said to the grumpy looking woman working  behind the counter (not that I blame her, I\'d probably be grumpy too in  her position). She glanced behind her at the roller thing that had hot  dogs on it, then looked back at me and said, ""We don\'t have any hot  dogs.""    WHAT? But this concession stand is called O What A Dog.  Making hot dogs is their primary mission! I said, ""Seriously?"" She  motioned to the hot dog roller behind her, ""They\'re not cooked."" I  continued. ""I just missed almost an entire inning waiting in line and  you don\'t have any hot dogs in the third inning of a baseball game on a  Saturday night?"" Then, the thing that infuriated me and sent me back to  my seat fuming happened. The concession lady said to me, ""Lots of stands  around here sell hot dogs, go wait in line somewhere else."" I didn\'t  even know what to say to that, so I just turned and left. I  returned to my seat just in time to see Adam Jones strike out to end  the third inning. I had missed an entire inning with nothing to show for  it. The combination of my hunger and my frustration over an  all-too-familiar problem at Camden Yards made me very cranky. (If you  don\'t believe me, just ask my husband. Or the couple sitting behind us  who seemed to be listening)    This  isn\'t a story that I like to write, but this is a scene that plays out over  and over again at Camden Yards. Once the game starts it is nearly  impossible to get through any line at any concession stand in less than  an inning. If the lines were actually very long (which sometimes they  are, certainly), I\'d be understanding. But often they are not. This is  not the first time that I or someone that I know has waited in a long and/or  slow line only to be sent away because the pretzels aren\'t cooked or  the nacho cheese isn\'t hot or they ran out of peppers and onions during  the first inning. I  do not complain about the amount of money that I spend at  baseball games, because I do so freely. Along with my in-laws, my  husband and I have a 29-game season ticket plan for the Orioles. I  regularly purchase food and drinks at the games despite their cost  because I like ballpark food and the ballpark atmosphere. But I don\'t  think that it\'s too much to ask that, when I\'m willing to shell out  nearly $15 for a hot dog and a beer, those in charge of running the  concession stand find a way to do their job in an efficient manner and  operate so that they don\'t serve all of their cooked hot dogs before  beginning to cook the next batch. I did get my hot dog eventually. I tried again in the seventh inning after the crowds had died down and I went to a different O What A Dog.  There was no line, they had plenty of hot dogs cooked, and the  gentleman serving me was friendly. But it was four innings too late to  earn my good will.    So  what about you, citizens of Birdland? Do you have your own horror  stories about the concessions at Camden Yards? When I tweeted out my  situation on Saturday I got more than enough responses to know that I\'m  not alone in this.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles defeated both the Tampa Bay Rays and the unusually cold April weather at Camden Yards on Wednesday afternoon. By good fortune the game was not an evening affair!Both teams managed six hits, while the Orioles were able to squeeze out three runs to none for the Rays. The O\xe2\x80\x99s managed to group their hits and walks just enough to eek out three scores on a day when the game-time temperature was 39 degrees, while the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 hits and walks were spread out by Baltimore pitching and defense.The swing inning was the 4th, where a diving catch by Nick Markakis and throw to second doubled off the runner for a critical double play. Manager Joe Madden took the slow trip to the field, while replays quickly demonstrated that Nick had indeed caught the ball above the ground.In the bottom of the 4th, the Baltimore Orioles loaded the bases with none out on a leadoff walk to Nelson Cruz and singles by Chris Davis and Adam Jones. For Jones, who was still recovering from the sickness circulating around the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse, the hit was a bunt single in front of Evan Longoria who was playing deep. Matt Wieters scored the first run on a long fly to center that would have been a slam on most any other warmer day. A J.J. Hardy groundout plated the second run.In the bottom of the 5th inning, the Baltimore Orioles again loaded the bases on Rays starter Jake Odorizzi with two walks sandwiching a Markakis single. Jones got the third run plated on another infield hit with a swinging bunt. So Jones tallied two hits on balls that probably only went about 75 feet combined. It all led to Buck Showalter talking about the baseball gods in the postgame interview.But there was nothing flakey about the Orioles pitching. Even with a high pitch count by starter Miguel Gonzalez, his placement was very good \xe2\x80\x93 living on the corners all day and being pinched a bit by the plate umpire. And again, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many times with Orioles pitchers, there are the multiple deep counts run up by hitters who foul off innumerable pitches. Even so, Gonzo was able to scatter three hits and three walks and keep the Rays off the board.Zach Britton gave the Birds three scoreless innings of relief, pitching out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the 7th inning. And after giving up a leadoff single in the 9th inning, Tommy Hunter closed out the game to record the save and the shutout.The win brings the Orioles to a 7-7 record, while dropping the Rays to 7-8. The next four games will be a series in Boston that begins on Friday against the struggling Red Sox.

""Regardless of the record, we have had some good things happen.""The Rays came up empty against the third and fourth pitchers in the Baltimore rotation. After Wei-Yin Chen excelled on Monday night, Miguel Gonzalez righted himself at the expense of the struggling Tampa Bay lineup.Gonzalez and two relievers blanked the Rays, allowing only one extra-base hit and striking out Wil Myers three times.""We faced 153 pitches today and didn\'t score a run. That\'s difficult to do,"" Maddon said. ""Our at bats have been good; the results haven\'t been.""Myers, who is batting .200, said, ""We\'re not getting it done with the bats. Especially me. I haven\'t done too much at the plate.""Tampa Bay\'s biggest threat came in the seventh, when a walk and singles by Yunel Escobar and Jose Molina loaded the bases against Zach Britton with one out. Ben Zobrist hit into a force play at the plate, and Myers struck out.""I had a chance to make something happen and couldn\'t get the big hit,"" Myers said. ""That\'s been the frustrating thing, not getting the hit to help the team.""Tampa Bay starter Jake Odorizzi (1-2) allowed three runs and five hits in five innings.Gonzalez (1-1) gave up three hits and three walks in five innings after entering with a 9.64 ERA. Britton permitted two singles over three innings to keep his ERA at 0.00, and Tommy Hunter got three outs for his fourth save.Because Tuesday night\'s game was postponed by rain, all players wore No. 42 to honor Jackie Robinson a day later than originally planned. The jerseys were worn over long-sleeved shirts, because the temperature at the start of the game was 39 degrees.Playing at designated hitter instead of center field after returning from an illness, Baltimore\'s Adam Jones reached on a bunt in a two-run fourth inning and drove in a run with a 50-foot chop down the third-base line in the fifth.""Sometimes you\'ve just got to be able to use your legs,"" Jones said. ""You\'re not always going to be able to swing the bat to the best of your ability or the way you would like to. So in certain situations it\'s smart to drop a bunt down and get your timing back.""Both starting pitchers dominated until the fourth inning. In the top half, the Rays got runners on first and second with one out before David DeJesus hit a sinking liner to right. Markakis caught the ball and threw to second for a double play.In the bottom half, Baltimore used a walk and two singles to load the bases with no outs. After Matt Wieters delivered a fly ball to the warning track that advanced all three runners, J.J.

04/17/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: What roster moves are coming?', 'The Orioles broke camp with the more out-of-options players on their 25-man roster than any other team in baseball. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave the flexibility Orioles fans have come to expect from a Buck Showalter club, and so far this season hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen many roster moves. However, with Troy Patton and Manny Machado nearing returns, the Orioles are going to be forced to make some difficult decisions.It was reported earlier this week that Manny Machado will begin running the bases. It seems to be the last logical step for his rehabbing knee. If all goes well, Machado could be playing simulated games next week, and before long entering a minor league rehab assignment. The Orioles would love to have him back sooner rather than later, but they will remain cautious not to rush their young star back. Once he does return the Orioles will be forced to make room for him on the 25-man roster.The obvious choice would seem to be Steve Pearce. With the late addition of Nelson Cruz, and Delmon Young making the club out of spring training, Pearce seems to be the odd man out. So far Buck has struggled to find at-bats for the right-hander, and with the other right-handed hitters on the club, Pearce doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to fill a discernible need. \xc2\xa0However, Pearce is out of options and would be forced to pass through waivers where the Orioles would likely lose him. If the Orioles can\xe2\x80\x99t make a deal with somebody, they\xe2\x80\x99ll likely hold on to Pearce.If the Orioles elect to hang on to Pearce, the next logical solution may be to send down Jonathan Schoop. The Orioles seem to like the versatility of Steve Lombardozzi and Ryan Flaherty, who have experience playing multiple positions at the major league level. There is no doubting Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s talent and athleticism, but he has struggled at times this season. He could probably benefit from a few more at-bats at AAA. Lombardozzi and Flaherty could platoon at second until Schoop is ready to return.The Orioles will have another dilemma in the bullpen once Troy Patton finishes serving his 25-game suspension for a failed drug test. Patton would give the Orioles three lefties in their bullpen, which may be more than they want to carry. The Orioles could try to move Patton, who has been serviceable out of the bullpen. However, there\xe2\x80\x99s probably not much value in soft-throwing lefties who are coming off their second failed drug test. The Orioles could try to move Brian Matusz or Zach Britton, but Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s slow start has probably hurt his value and Britton is\xc2\xa0pitching too well to let go of. If they decide to keep three lefties in their bullpen, they could try to find a trade partner for Josh Stinson. Stinson has started out the season slow, but at only twenty-six, may have enough trade value to warrant a move. If a move can\xe2\x80\x99t be made, Evan Meek and Ryan Webb still have options, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine either of them being sent down.Having too many quality players is a nice problem to have. It\xe2\x80\x99s a problem every team would love to have. Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter always seem to find a clever way of manipulating the roster, and it can be assured that they have some kind of plan in place.

Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles play in the most difficult division in MLB, but the American League East has not been nearly as powerful as in the past or as predicted for 2014. At least not yet. Every team in the division is dealing with some varied issues and challenges.The combined record of AL East teams after play on Wednesday, April 16th is 37-36. The AL Central is 33-32 and the AL West stands at 36-36.There is a great opportunity for the Baltimore Orioles to take advantage of the current overall situation if they are able to play well in the coming two weeks. It has been acknowledged all along that the Orioles have a very difficult early schedule. Some have said that the Birds would do well to simply get through the month of April with a .500 record.\xc2\xa0 Right now they are at 7-7 with 12 games remaining in the month: four against Boston, three with Toronto followed by three with Kansas City, and then two with Pittsburgh.If the Orioles can bag wins now, they can presumably perform better than the other AL East teams later in the season that will face greater difficulties in their schedules \xe2\x80\x93 particularly against each other.Though the Baltimore Orioles have played much better in recent days after scoring only five runs in 30 innings against the Jays, there has been much to cause concern for Birds fans. The sketchy performance of the rotation has validated the primary fears of so many about this Achilles heel for the O\xe2\x80\x99s; and the hitting has been very (shall we say?) hit and miss. All in all, though Birds lovers may have wished for one or two more wins at this point, the Orioles have done well, all things considered, to be 7-7 at this juncture.With Miguel Gonzalez throwing a fairly strong outing yesterday, and with Bud Norris and Wei-Yin Chen also performing well in their most recent starts, hope exists that they will provide some stability behind the lights-out ace Chris Tillman. Only Ubaldo Jimenez is still on the wrong side of the stats in terms of having any sort of good start over the first 14 games.Every team in the AL East has had to deal with some injuries. The Orioles are still hoping that Manny Machado may return before too long. Other injuries have not been as devastating \xe2\x80\xa6 at least as compared to divisional rivals.Boston Red SoxThere has been a rash of injuries striking the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 next four-game series opponent \xe2\x80\x93 the Boston Red Sox. Right now may be an opportune time to be playing the defending World Champions. Dustin Pedroia is back from an inflamed wrist injury, though he is not likely his full self, batting at .246.\xc2\xa0 Mike Napoli dislocated his ring finger in a slide on Tuesday and is day to day. Shane Victorino (hamstring strain) and Will Middlebrooks (right calf strain) are on the 15-day DL. Koji Uehara has been set aside for a few days with shoulder issues. And, of course, Ryan Dempster is out for the season.The Red Sox pitching has been decent \xe2\x80\x93 especially with Clay Buchholz having a first respectable outing just last night \xe2\x80\x93 but the offense has been anemic. David Ortiz is batting a mere .237, and the RISP is well south of .200 on the young season.Tampa Bay RaysCertainly the Rays are the team picked most often by the most prognosticators as the team to beat in the AL East this year. Though they may yet put it all together, those predictions were made before the onset of a host of pitching injuries hit the team. Matt Moore is now out for the season, and Alex Cobb and Jeremy Hellickson are not likely to be pitching very soon \xe2\x80\x93 especially the latter, who is assumed to be out until at least late May.The Rays have trouble generating a great deal of offense and are thus very dependent upon their pitching. Frankly, the Rays looked terribly anemic and weak the past couple of days. There was nothing about them that gave any appearance of a top-drawer outfit.New York YankeesAgain, somehow the Yankees win and stand at 9-6. Masahiro Tanaka may well prove to be worth all the Shekels or Yen or whatever currency he is paid in. But problems remain all over the field. Mark Texeira is on the DL, Brian Roberts has back troubles (imagine that), and back-up catcher Francisco Cervelli has been put today on the 60-day DL. Their bullpen is suspect with David Robertson on the DL until 4/22.Toronto Blue JaysOther than shortstop Jose Reyes, the Jays have had less of the injury problems than the rest of the division (unlike last year!). They have had pitching performances beyond what has been expected or what could be anticipated to continue. Even though they recently took two out of three games against the Baltimore Orioles, honestly, that is not a great lineup, and many of them are performing below historic levels. Though this team is a bit improved over 2013, it is simply not a great squad.Conclusion \xe2\x80\x93 Though every year in MLB we see a team or two who puts it together in the second half of the season and makes a run into the playoffs, the time to win is now \xe2\x80\xa6 it is always the time to win! And wins now could prove to be very fortuitous for the Baltimore Orioles as the season progresses. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Trading Jim Johnson was the right move for Orioles ...', "" Entering this past offseason, Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations Dan Duquette was placed in what seemed to be a difficult position. After saving at least 50 games in each of the past two seasons, closer Jim Johnson was in line for a steep salary increase thanks to arbitration. Duquette was on record saying that the Orioles would tender a contract to Johnson when the time came to do so, but the American League\xe2\x80\x99s save leader was shipped to Oakland for second baseman Jemile Weeks just days before arbitration arrived. At the time, it was rumored that Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 salary would be in the range of $10.8 million, an increase from only $6.5 million the previous year. With possible contract extensions for Chris Davis, J.J. Hardy, and Matt Wieters looming, the Orioles were not about to dedicate ten percent of their payroll to a relief pitcher on the decline. Never mind his 101 saves over the past two seasons, Johnson had blown nine saves and suffered eight losses in 2013, with the Orioles just six games removed from their second-consecutive playoff berth. It\xe2\x80\x99s na\xc3\xafve to think that Johnson could convert every save opportunity, and if he did so, the Orioles would hae made the postseason, but his sole job is to close out the other team. That alone is what has cost him his job in Oakland. After only five appearances in an Athletics uniform, Johnson was removed from the closer\xe2\x80\x99s role in favor of a closer-by-committee. A\xe2\x80\x99s manager Bob Melvin said that the 30-year-old Johnson simply needed a break to straighten himself out and relieve the pressure he\xe2\x80\x99s put on himself with his new team.    To make matters worse, the Athletics are even more penny-pinching than the Orioles. In fact, their total payroll is roughly $20 million less than that of Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s, showing that the team has a vested interest in Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s success. The second-highest paid player on their roster behind Yoenis Cespedes, Johnson is not a stranger to rough patches, however.    Johnson blew four saves in six-appearances in May, as well as three-consecutive opportunities in August, yet still managed to lead the league in saves. Since his demotion, Johnson has had two decent outings, but nothing worth the salary he commands. Those who considered Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s exit nothing more than a simple salary dump were correct, but should be happy that he is no longer giving up long balls in Camden Yards.    Meanwhile, the team has moved on without the former All-Star, handing the job to the much-maligned Tommy Hunter. The seven-year pro has taken his new role in stride, converting four of the five save opportunities he\xe2\x80\x99s acquired this season. Although it is still early, Hunter has shown he\xe2\x80\x99s able to shut down even the most potent lineup, topping out at speeds around 100 mph. Orioles manager Buck Showalter has shown confidence in Hunter, but there is still a ways to go before the club knows if Hunter is the long-term answer in Baltimore. The job wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his until the conclusion of spring training, so if Tommy Goes Boom in the near-future, who does Showalter rely on? That\xe2\x80\x99s a question for another time, if it\xe2\x80\x99s ever asked. When Duquette traded Johnson, however, the Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t expected to promote their closer from within the clubhouse. Instead, they signed free agent Grant Balfour to a two-year, $15 million contract, shortly after the trade with Oakland. However, the former Athletic did not pass a physical from team doctors, who noted concerns over his wrist and recovering knee.    Some believe that the Orioles were inactive for much of the offseason due to the way the organization was chastised for their handling of Balfour. Shortly thereafter, Balfour, who converted 38 saves in 41 chances last season, signed with division rival Tampa Bay. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t again until February that the Orioles decided to make a splash in the free agency market, signing starting pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez to a four-year, $50 million deal. While Jimenez hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lived up to the hype thus far, allowing four earned runs per start, it should be noted that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense has failed to give the Cy Young candidate any run support, either. Later that week, the club added hard-hitting outfielder Nelson Cruz into the fold with a one-year, $8 million deal. Cruz adds a power bat to an already potent Orioles lineup and leads the team in homeruns at the moment. Without trading Johnson, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible neither of the deals become reality. If the Orioles locked Johnson into a long-term deal, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that Jimenez is still with Cleveland. The same could be said of Cruz, who would still be in search of a job if Baltimore tendered Johnson a one-year deal. While there are still gaps in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s lineup, most notably at second base, the Orioles are in a much better place without Jim Johnson. There is the unknown factor to Tommy Hunter, but same could have been said about Johnson going into the 2012 season. Prior to his record-setting year, Johnson had recorded only two saves in his rookie season, as he wrestled the job away from journeyman Kevin Gregg.    At second base, the Orioles have used a platoon of players and have flirted with promoting Weeks from Triple-A Norfolk. Baltimore wasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking to receive anything of note in return from Oakland, but any production from the former top prospect is a bonus. That in itself is testament to the club's perceived value of Johnson.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Interview with T.J. McFarland of the Norfolk Tides ...', "" After spending all of 2013 as a relief pitcher with the Orioles, T.J. McFarland started this season in the rotation for the Norfolk Tides. In two starts he has pitched nine innings with just one earned run allowed, two walks, 10 strikeouts, and 14 ground outs against just two fly outs. If he can keep that up, a promotion to the Orioles is likely in his future. Get to know a little about McFarland's background and game here. Can you tell us a little bit about growing up in Illinois and the baseball following there? Illinois was cold. We played in March when it still would snow. The first game would be called off for snow. I started when I was 5. I had to sneak on to the t-ball team because I was too young. Ever since then, I've been playing every summer. Draft Day 2007--what was going through your head when Cleveland drafted you? It was a big day. I had a little bit of a buzz in terms of getting drafted or not. I remember watching on the internet and I got a phone call within a second of them calling my name. I talked to Cleveland and from there it was awesome. I was still debating about going to college or not because I had committed to go to Missouri, but things worked out. The Rule 5 draft brought you to Baltimore. What can you tell us about the Rule 5 Draft? After your fifth full season out of the high school draft, if you're not protected on the 40-man, you get the opportunity to go into the Rule 5 draft which means another team can pick you up. I was fortunate enough to get picked up by Baltimore. The rule with that was I had to be in the big leagues for the whole year or otherwise I would get sent back and I ended up sticking.    Can you talk to us about making your first MLB game against the Yankees? I remember coming out into the new Yankee Stadium and just being in awe for the first minute or so. I was able to calm my nerves and pitch a little bit. It was a once in a lifetime experience for the first time ever to go out into Yankee stadium. It was pretty intimidating, but I was able to get through it.    What type of pitches do you throw? I mainly throw sinkers, which is a fastball that just sinks and I'll throw a slider and a change up. Which one is your go-to pitch? Sinker is my go-to pitch; we get a whole lot of ground balls. I rely on contact to get outs. Sinker is my go-to, but change up and slider are good secondary pitches.    How are you using your time in Norfolk to improve your game? Right now I'm working on the change up. Last year I didn't start at all so being down here gives me a chance to start every fifth day and get some work in. The change up is a big pitch for me as a starter. Growing up near Chicago were you a White Sox or Cubs fan? I grew up on the south side of Chicago so it's White Sox.

04/18/2014,"[(""Ryan Flaherty's place among the worst-hitting Orioles of ..."", "" One of the players on the Orioles offseason hype train was Ryan Flaherty. At Fanfest, when reporters spoke to J.J. Hardy, he said that he thought that Flaherty, given a full season, could hit 15-20 home runs. It looked like he was sure to be the regular second baseman and you could talk yourself into believing he'd do OK. When he started the 2014 season with no hits in his first four games, reality crushed those dreams, and instead of wondering if he'd hit 20 home runs, instead you had to wonder whether he is the worst hitter ever to play for the Orioles, because that's the kind of hyperbole that you can engage in after four games. There's nothing else to talk about. He's no longer batting .000/.000/.000, but he's still scuffling at the plate after two weeks of baseball, and when you watch him, it still feels like he might be the worst. Flaherty has made 480 plate appearances as an Oriole. There are 166 players who have at least as many plate appearances in Orioles history. A top of the order hitter who plays every day will get around 700 plate appearances in a season, so he doesn't even have a full year's worth of plate appearances under his belt, but it's enough to figure that he is something close to what we've seen so far. This is particularly true since he's 27. As it turns out, Flaherty is not the worst-hitting Oriole ever, or even in recent memory. One quick and dirty way to compare players against both their contemporaries and players in the past is a statistic called OPS+, which takes a player's OPS (on-base percentage plus slugging) and adjusts for ballpark and league, then gives you a number. An average, OK number is 100. More is good. Less is not good.    Flaherty's career OPS+ on this date is 74, which means he's been 26% than league average during his career. This places him in 143rd place on the O's career list. The bottom four on the list are all pitchers, so he's really 143 out of 162. He has the same number of career triples as Jim Palmer, which is one.    Here's how Flaherty stacks up against the worst of the worst-hitting Orioles of all time.   Player Rank PA AVG OBP SLG OPS+   Ryan Flaherty 143 480 .217 .276 .365 74   Mark Belanger 153 6544 .227 .300 .280 68   Dave Duncan 154 640 .205 .258 .310 68   Geronimo Gil 155 871 .233 .279 .341 66   Kiko Garcia 156 1167 .232 .278 .317 66   Marv Breeding 157 1107 .248 .289 .313 65   Joe Ginsberg 158 585 .219 .301 .280 64   Jeff Reboulet 159 612 .217 .321 .283 61   Rene Gonzales 160 631 .221 .275 .281 58   Cesar Izturis 161 958 .240 .283 .292 56   Willy Miranda 162 1724 .219 .279 .266 53      You may have noticed a little trend here, in that these names are nearly all crappy, light-hitting infielders who spent a few years in a utility role with the Orioles. There are also a couple of crappy-hitting catchers. Among the players ranked 144-152 are Billy Ripken, Robert Andino, and Deivi Cruz. You see the pattern here. Flaherty fits right in with this lot. The only thing surprising about Flaherty is that we (by which I mostly mean I) ever tricked ourselves into believing him to be anything else. Hope is a funny thing. There are a couple of other surprising finds on this list. The fact that Izturis was not the worst-hitting Oriole of all time is the real shocker. I also never remembered that Reboulet was so terrible, probably solely because of that home run he hit off of Randy Johnson in the playoffs. Man, that was fantastic. In case you were curious about where some others among this season's Orioles rank, there are six players in addition to Flaherty with enough plate appearances to qualify. They are: Chris Davis (6th, 140 OPS+), Nick Markakis (39th, 113), Adam Jones (50th, 110), Matt Wieters (79th, 100), Manny Machado (80th, 100), and J.J. Hardy (90th, 96).    So, the next time someone tells you that Ryan Flaherty is the worst-hitting Oriole of all time, you can tell them that, no, he isn't the worst, just near the bottom of the list. If he heats up, he might even get to pass luminaries like Lenn Sakata and John Shelby.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles open up key weekend series in Beantown', 'The Baltimore Orioles open up a key series over the weekend tonight in Boston against the BoSox at Fenway Park. I call it a key series because Boston took two-of-three from the Orioles in the first series of the season, and they\xe2\x80\x99re a team the O\xe2\x80\x99s are going to have to get by if this season is going to be a success. The good news for Orioles fans is that the team really started clicking on all cylinders this past week against Tampa. On Monday we saw how potent the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup can be, and on Wednesday we had the chance to see the Birds scoring runs in smaller bunches and in less conspicuous manners. The key to beating Boston remains pitching, and if the Orioles can get solid pitching this weekend they\xe2\x80\x99ll be in good shape.Many people have commented on how brutal the early schedule has been for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, as they\xe2\x80\x99ve played all but three games within the AL East. However my point there would be that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to play all of these teams 18-19 times anyways \xe2\x80\x93 so you\xe2\x80\x99ll get them at some point. So that\xe2\x80\x99s not really an issue in my mind. What is kind of a petty quirk by the league office (who made the schedule) is to have the O\xe2\x80\x99s and BoSox playing the Sunday Night Baseball game on ESPN this weekend, and then have to turn around and play an 11 AM game on Monday (which is Patriot\xe2\x80\x99s Day in Boston). Mind you, there\xe2\x80\x99s no issue withe O\xe2\x80\x99s being the team to play Boston on Monday, as quite frankly it\xe2\x80\x99s an honor to take part in a tradition such as the 11 AM Patriot\xe2\x80\x99s Day game at Fenway.The issue is the Sunday night game the evening before. The league feels that they\xe2\x80\x99re addressing this \xe2\x80\x9cproblem\xe2\x80\x9d by moving the start time to 7 PM as opposed to the normal 8 PM timeslot for ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday Night Baseball. However playing a day game after a night game is tough enough as it is on players\xe2\x80\xa6but at 11 AM? Obviously Buck Showalter and the Orioles will roll with it (because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have much choice in the matter), but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99re too happy about it. Incidentally playing on Sunday Night Baseball is also great exposure for the O\xe2\x80\x99s nationally. But again, the issue is having to turn around and play the next morning. But the fact is that the BoSox are in the same boat in terms of the schedule.Chris Tillman will take to the mound tonight in game one of the series, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be faced by John Lackey. Tillman of course was initially going to pitch on Saturday, but Showalter reshuffled the rotation just a bit as a result of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s rain out. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will then turn around and play tomorrow at 1:30 before going into the aforementioned Sunday night/Monday morning sequence.

We saw our share of games just like that where the Orioles were the losing team that lost. On a cold Friday night in Boston, this (hopefully) good Orioles team triumphed 8-4 over the defending World Series champions despite their starter having a jacked-up pitch count and allowing three runs in five innings. The hitters did enough for a relatively comfortable, if long and still sorta nerve-wracking, victory. Coming into the game, the starting pitching matchup of Chris Tillman against John Lackey looked like it might have the makings of a pitcher's duel. That was not to be. First pitch temperature was 42 degrees and neither starter looked good in the cold. Tillman allowed seven hits and four walks, throwing 122 pitches while getting through only five innings. The Red Sox being the Red Sox, they battled, they waited him out, they had him near a hundred pitches before he was finished four. It looked like madness to bring him back out for the fifth inning, and it looked even moreso after the first two batters reached base: a double by Daniel Nava and an RBI single by Dustin Pedroia. After two men were out, he walked Xander Bogaerts and then gave up another RBI single to A.J. Pierzynski. This made the score at this point 6-3, bringing the tying run to the plate in the form of Jackie Bradley Jr. Tillman was tiring. He looked to be unable to find the strike zone with anything other than meatball batting practice fastballs. He went to a three-ball count and looked to be down to fumes. This is where you expect the Orioles pitcher to surrender the walk and then the grand slam. Tillman reached down into wherever he might find a little something extra, running the count full and ultimately striking out Bradley on the ninth pitch of the at-bat. That's what you call winning without your best stuff.    On the night, the Orioles hitters had fifteen hits, and they even took five walks. Who are these guys? Every starter had at least one hit except for Chris Davis. Nick Markakis, Adam Jones, J.J. Hardy, Steve Lombardozzi, and Jonathan Schoop all had multi-hit games. Schoop went 4-for-5, including two doubles. As a team, they batted 6-for-17 with runners in scoring position. It was not a pretty game, and at 3:26, not a short game. Still, the Orioles were the best team on the diamond on the night. The scoreboard shows it.    The O's didn't wait long to start scoring against Lackey. Markakis led off with a double into the left field corner. Let's put that on hold for a second to briefly address something. The ball appeared to land foul by just a tiny shred. Red Sox manager John Farrell challenged the play. Replays looked close but still conclusively showing the ball landing foul, hitting no chalk. The unseen forces in New York blew this replay, somehow.\xc2\xa0This is the sound of me crying over the injustice done to Boston on this play. Markakis moved over on a groundout by Davis and then scored on an infield single by Jones. Markakis struck again with a run-scoring double in the third inning, and scored later on a two-run single from Nelson Cruz. The score at the end of the third was 4-0. The Orioles just kept on scoring. They even got an insurance run in the ninth inning thanks to Schoop's second double, pushing the game out of Tommy Hunter range. Darren O'Day, who entered with two outs in the eighth inning and the score 7-4, was credited with a save after pitching the final 1.1 innings.    Perhaps because he enjoyed what he saw from Zach Britton, manager Buck Showalter decided to throw another lefty out into this game for multiple innings. That was Brian Matusz, who gave up one run on four hits in 2.2 innings. It was an adventure. I'm not entirely sure how he only gave up one run. But it worked out for Showalter and the Orioles this time, and saved the rest of the bullpen from some of the workload you might otherwise expect on a night where the starter only went five innings. Despite that, the O's only used three pitchers. In this space, I have often maligned Markakis, so here are a few good words about him. With a pair of doubles and a walk tonight, he's raised his batting line to .273/.290/.348 and may well be heading in the right direction. The win gives the Orioles their first three-game winning streak of the year. They never won much more than that in a row last year, so it'll be something to see if they can string together a long one here by continuing to beat the Red Sox, who they will play for the next three games. The O's 8-7 record is currently good for second place in the AL East, a game behind the Yankees, who've played and won two more games.    It had little to do with the outcome of the game, but Matt Wieters was thrown out while stealing a base. That's dumb. If you read in the box score that Matt Wieters was caught stealing, someone did something dumb. Wieters should not be running, much as runners should never run on Wieters. It was probably a blown hit-and-run - the play was a strike 'em out, throw 'em out double play - and that may have been the only reason he was running, but seriously, don't run Matt Wieters. Even if you think you might break up a ground-ball double play in doing so. Back to an afternoon game on Saturday, with a 1:35 start time for the second game of the series. Bud Norris will start for the Orioles, looking to build on his strong outing last time against the Blue Jays. The O's hitters will be facing off against Felix Doubront.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have found clutch hitting with runners in scoring position, even with two outs, to be the key ingredient for wins this year. Last night in Boston was a \xe2\x80\x9cgood Friday\xe2\x80\x9d for the Orioles as they had consistent hitting to power them to an 8-4 win over the Red Sox. The Birds pounded out 15 hits and were 6-for-17 with RISP (runners in scoring position).For this 2014 season so far, the Orioles are hitting .338 with RISP in the eight games that they have won (26-for-77). And this includes four of the eight games being low-scoring pitching affairs.Over the last several years, even with the powerful hitting teams the Orioles have had, they have so frequently had problems hitting with this situational batting category of scoring runs when the opportunity was present.In 2013, the Orioles were sixth in the AL with RISP at .266, though the numbers powering those stats often came in blowout wins. They were 11th in the AL with RISP and two out \xe2\x80\x93 batting at .231.Currently this season, the Baltimore Orioles are batting .295 with RISP, which is first in the American League. The Texas Rangers are next at .271 (with the Red Sox at .212 by comparison). The Orioles are also the best in the even more critical and difficult situation of RISP with two outs. The Birds are hitting .284 (the Sox .188, the Yanks .185). These numbers are not likely to be sustainable over a whole season, but excellence in this category will go a long way toward success at the highest level.Some Overall Statistical RankingsWhile looking at some stats for this piece, let me share a couple of others that are both encouraging and disappointing for the Baltimore Orioles.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are 3rd in the AL in overall batting average at .268 (behind the Yankees at .277 and Rangers at .273. But the Orioles are next to last in homers with a total of only nine (Would you have believed that a few weeks ago?). The Orioles had hoped to improve their on-base percentage, but that is still a struggle, as they are 11th in the AL at .313.On the pitching side of things, the Baltimore Orioles are slightly below the league average overall \xe2\x80\x93 tied for eighth in ERA at 3.93 for example. They are surprisingly fourth in walks given up, with only 44 (imagine where they\xe2\x80\x99d be without Ubaldo!), but are dead last by far in strikeouts with only 94. This final stat is not surprising for any O\xe2\x80\x99s fans who watch games and see the pitch counts rise with incessant foul balls. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t more of the Orioles pitchers have \xe2\x80\x9cput-away\xe2\x80\x9d pitches?Saturday in BostonThe Orioles have a 1:35 afternoon game today that will pit Felix Doubrant against Bud Norris.Doubrant pitched against the Orioles on April 3rd and won a 4-3 game over Wei-Yin Chen. But he gave up three runs on six hits along with four walks in 5.1 innings of work. His other two starts this season have not been great either. He only lasted 2.2 innings against Texas giving up six hits and five runs. Doubrant did have a quality start against the Yankees in his last outing, with seven hits and three runs in 6.2 innings. The 26-year-old is 25-20 for his career, with a 4.70 ERA.For the Orioles against Doubrant, it is a very mixed bag of results. Over his career against the O\xe2\x80\x99s he is 2-2 in 41 innings with a 4.61 ERA. Adam Jones, J.J.

He struck out five.""These guys always fight until the very end,"" Tillman said. ""They\'re fouling pitches off, they\'re taking good pitches, taking tough pitches. When you make a mistake, they capitalize on it.""Markakis led off the game with a double down the left-field line. Red Sox manager John Farrell challenged the call, but it was upheld and Markakis scored on Adam Jones\' first hit, a ball fielded by Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts on the outfield grass.""It looked pretty foul to me,"" Lackey said.

"" We got a couple of hits and we got him (Tillman) out of there early. (We) got in the bullpen and we had more chances. Unfortunately, every time we scored it seemed like they came back and scored. Just one of those nights where things didn\'t work out.""Tillman struck out Jackie Bradley with runners on first and second to end the Red Sox threat in the fifth.""Tilly made a big pitch there on Bradley,"" Showalter said. ""It was a challenge for him. He deserved that.""Baltimore scored two runs in the fifth on singles by Matt Wieters and J.J. Hardy, and added a run in the seventh and another in the ninth on the doubles by Schoop.Darren O\'Day recorded the last four outs for his first save of the year.David Ortiz took a scheduled night off. Mike Carp took his place in the lineup and had two hits, as did Holt. Every Boston starter had at least one hit.The Red Sox were beneficiaries of a replay in the seventh, when it showed that Holt beat out a throw from Orioles second baseman Steve Lombardozzi for a base hit. The next three Red Sox were retired on ground balls, squandering the scoring opportunity.NOTES: Boston OF Shane Victorino will begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Pawtucket on Saturday.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles will be nationally televised tonight as they play the third game of their four-game series with Boston Red Sox on ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday Night Baseball at 7 p.m. EST. The Orioles and Red Sox have split the first two games of the series, with the Orioles taking the first game 8-4 and the Sox taking the second 4-2.Big Start for JimenezTonight represents a great opportunity for Ubaldo Jimenez (0-3, 7.31) to right the ship and change the viewpoint of many fans who are beginning to question his acquisition. Jimenez has the second-worst WHIP in MLB, allowing more than two walks or hits per innings pitched, and has not gone more than six innings in any of his three starts for the Orioles.Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s failure to locate and get ahead of hitters have caused him to lean more heavily on his fastball later in the count. This year, Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s fastball velocity has dropped nearly 2 mph. Hitters have been able to catch up to Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s fastball and Jimenez has put himself in situations where hitters can predict he will throw it.To have success tonight, Jimenez must either throw his breaking ball more consistently for strikes, giving him another option when he gets down in the count, or throw strike one more often so he has the ability to use all of his pitches later.AL East Starts TightAs many predicted, the AL East has been the most hotly contested division in baseball throughout the first few weeks of the season. Every team in the AL East is within two games of each other. Most do not expect much more distance all the way until the season\xe2\x80\x99s end.The Orioles come into tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game at 8-8, one full game behind the division leading 10-8 New York Yankees. Boston is in last place in the division at 8-10.Every game against a division opponent is extremely important for the Orioles, especially because they will not only be competing with these teams for a possible division crown, but also for a potential Wild Card spot in the 2014 postseason.Bullpen Remains the KeyOrioles starters have pitched the second fewest innings in the major leagues, putting pressure on the bullpen. Given Ubaldo Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s lack of control in his first few starts and tendency to run a high pitch count, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen is called on again tonight to pitch three innings or more.So far this season, Orioles relievers have answered the call, sporting a 3.00 ERA in 51 innings pitched. Zach Britton, Evan Meek, and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day all have yet to give up a run this season. Tommy Hunter has converted four of five save opportunities and has shown the ability to get left-handers out, holding them to a .200 batting average.For the Orioles to remain in contention, the bullpen needs to continue to be a strength of this team.

Mandatory Credit: Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY SportsAfter a devastating loss in Boston on national TV on Sunday evening, the Baltimore Orioles will need to be up early for a rare Monday morning game against the Red Sox. Here is a quick preview of what is a very important game for the Orioles to win.The Birds will be facing a historically difficult character in Clay Buchholz. Though he is off to a rather poor start over his first three games of 2014, his lifelong record against the Baltimore Orioles is outstanding at 9-3 with a 3.40 ERA in 16 games. His MLB career record is 58-34 with a 3.64 ERA, and three of the four complete games in his career were against the O\xe2\x80\x99s.Not surprisingly, few Baltimore Orioles hitters have good career numbers against Buchholz. One who does in J.J. Hardy, though he went out of Sunday evening\xe2\x80\x99s game with a tweaked hamstring injury and will not likely be playing. Nelson Cruz is 4-for-10 with a homer. Adam Jones and Chris Davis have a pair of home runs off him, though their average against is .222 and .278. Nick Markakis is only 5-for-37 \xe2\x80\xa6 not many pitchers have that sort of dominance over the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 right fielder.ABH2B3BHRRBIBBSOBANick Markakis375000265.135Adam Jones2763021023.222Matt Wieters306200144.200Chris Davis185102236.278J.J.

After two rough starts to begin the 2014 season, Chen threw a good 6.1 innings against Tampa Bay while giving up only one run.Chen\xe2\x80\x99s numbers against the Red Sox over his eight starts are not very good at all. He is 2-3 with an ERA of 5.24 \xe2\x80\xa6 and Boston is batting .349 against him.The news just gets worse when looking at the individual matchups. Dustin Pedroia is 11-for-22 and Daniel Nava is 6-for-11. Mike Napoli is only 3-for-13, but those hits are a double and two homers.This is not encouraging, but it is baseball and anything can and will happen.ABH2B3BHRRBIBBSOBADustin Pedroia2211410421.500Jonny Gomes174001126.235Will Middlebrooks198200004.421David Ortiz135001513.385Mike Napoli133102214.231David Ross134100303.308Daniel Nava116001312.545A.J.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles used a six-run third inning off Boston starter Clay Buchholz to gain an insurmountable lead in a 7-6 victory over the Red Sox on Patriot Day. Apart from a Steve Clevenger double, the rest of the damage was done on a string of singles by a host of Orioles batters.The win for the Baltimore Orioles salvaged a split in the four-game series, though really the Birds should be flying to Toronto with three victories. After blowing a 5-0 lead yesterday, the Orioles came within 90 feet today of losing a 6-0 advantage. Two consecutive losses of that sort would have been terribly damaging and difficult for the Orioles to absorb.But the Red Sox proved once again that they don\xe2\x80\x99t die easily, especially the diminutive Dustin Pedoria who is about the size of a seventh grader. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how he does it, but he can flat-out hit. Over the series he was 7-for-15 with four doubles. And Brock Holt \xe2\x80\x93 called up from AAA to take the place of Ryan Roberts just before the Orioles came to town\xe2\x80\x93 was 6-for-14 over the four games. David Ortiz was 5-for-12 (missing the first game) with a homer and three walks.Over the past two games, after getting leads that should not be lost, the Red Sox picked away and crawled back into each \xe2\x80\x93 nearly winning again this afternoon. So why is this happening with the Orioles, and is it a concern moving forward? Here are some reasons \xe2\x80\xa6The Transitional Inning \xe2\x80\x93 Yesterday the Orioles lost a game largely because of all the controversy surrounding the \xe2\x80\x9ctransitional play.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But really hurting the Orioles right now is what I\xe2\x80\x99ll call the \xe2\x80\x9ctransitional inning\xe2\x80\x9d from the starter to the first reliever.It does not take much in the way of insightful baseball analysis to know that the regular inability of the Baltimore Orioles starters to go deep into games has a cumulative negative effect on outcomes. This was the primary concern coming into the season, and the first 18 games have validated that worry as having substance. And where it is being most profoundly felt at the moment is not so much with the bullpen wearing out and giving up runs, but with the starter particularly faltering in his last inning of work (the \xe2\x80\x9ctransitional inning\xe2\x80\x9d).In the Boston series, 10 of the 20 runs scored by the Red Sox were given up by the starters in their final inning or portion of an inning before being replaced. Buck Showalter has to let them attempt to go deeper; he can\xe2\x80\x99t be taking them out in the 5th inning or beginning of the 6th frame night after night.It is clear to even the casual observer that when the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters begin to tire, they lose placement quickly. They are unable to hit corners. The hitter is able to work counts favorably for either a base on balls or to get a pitch over the center of the plate. Boom! Runs! Lead gone or diminished.So how can this be fixed? That is the million-dollar question, or, in one case, the $50 million dollar question. Either these starters have to find ways to pitch to contact successfully and develop more put-away pitches, or they are going to be eventually replaced by upcoming arms who will be able to do that.These are the Red Sox \xe2\x80\x93 As much as I truly hate to admit it, these guys are really good. They are ugly and annoying with their incessant strike-zone complaints, but they are really good baseball players. After a rough start on the season, they have been coming from behind in the past week.It is a great skill to flick off pitches and wait for the one mistake that can be squared up. Here is an unusual stat \xe2\x80\xa6 today the Orioles pitchers threw 167 pitches compared to the Sox tossing 127. Yesterday it was 171-141. This is about as sustainable as running up the national debt.This is Fenway Park \xe2\x80\x93 The ballpark is famous for these scenarios \xe2\x80\xa6 always has been and always will be. The green monster will facilitate comebacks. Other parks will not present the same opportunity.The Defense is not Helping \xe2\x80\x93 With J.J. Hardy dealing with a couple of early season injuries and with Manny Machado still a few weeks away from a return, the defense is simply not clicking at a level the Baltimore Orioles have been accustomed to seeing. This extends innings, runs up the pitch counts, and allows for more runs to score. Even on some plays that are not going into the books as errors, there are plays not being made \xe2\x80\x93 an example being a grounder to Steve Lombardozzi today that likely should have been an out but was played into an infield single.As a final thought, great teams having a great season need to win close games as a pattern of life. That is what the Baltimore Orioles did in 2012, and they will need to do it again if they want to be playing baseball in October.

Mr. Rushin came up with the name \xe2\x80\x94 in honor of the late Yankee catcher Thurman Munson and the retired Red Sox right fielder Trot Nixon \xe2\x80\x94 in 2003, and he had to guess where the line ran: \xe2\x80\x9cnorth of New Haven but south of Hartford, running the breadth of central Connecticut.\xe2\x80\x9d  We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to guess anymore.  Fans may not list which team they favor on the census, but millions of them do make their preferences public on Facebook. Using aggregated data provided by the company, we were able to create an unprecedented look at the geography of baseball fandom, going down not only to the county level, as Facebook did in a nationwide map it released a few weeks ago, but also to ZIP codes. We can now clearly see that both Hartford and New Haven are in fact Yankee outposts. We can also determine the precise Chicago neighborhoods where White Sox jerseys stop being welcome and the central California town where the Dodgers cede fan favorite status to the Giants.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve created two features to help readers explore the data. First is an interactive map of the United States that allows you to explore not just the most popular team in your neighborhood but also a table of the top teams for any ZIP code in the country.  Second, in the spirit of Mr. Rushin\xe2\x80\x99s Munson-Nixon line, we\'ve generated 14 maps detailing baseball\xe2\x80\x99s biggest rivalries, highlighting the borders and offering suggested names for those lines.  The maps were created using estimates of team support based on how many Facebook users \xe2\x80\x9cliked\xe2\x80\x9d\teach team in a ZIP code. We applied an algorithm to smooth the data and fill in gaps where data was missing.  If you have alternate suggestions for border names, or have an idea or suggestion for a map not shown here, leave us a message in the comments or on Twitter or our Facebook page. We\'ll be updating this list regularly. Hopefully, this is just the start.       New York Yankees vs. Boston Red Sox Munson-Nixon Redux         We begin with a new take on the Munson-Nixon line, which differs from some previous interpretations in that it shows that Hartford has declared for the Yankees. It\xe2\x80\x99s still a border town, but it\'s a border town the way El Paso is \xe2\x80\x94 clearly on the Yankee side. One tidbit: Red Sox Nation seems to have conquered some new territory since 2012, when Ben Blatt tried to draw such a line. (Winning a World Series will do that.) We also encourage you to read our colleague John Branch\'s attempt at drawing the line in 2006, which is quite impressive and accurate given his shoe-leather means.      New York Mets vs. New York Yankees The We\xe2\x80\x99d-Draw-a-Line-If-We-Could Line         There\xe2\x80\x99s no other way to put it: The Yankees are the preferred team everywhere in New York City, and nearly everywhere in the U.S. over the Mets (in more than 98 percent of ZIP codes nationwide). One small Mets bright spot, if you want to call it that, is that in the area in Queens surrounding Citi Field, where the Mets play, Facebook users had the courtesy to prefer what some call the Evil Empire at a slightly reduced rate relative to its advantage elsewhere in New York.      Minnesota Twins vs. Milwaukee Brewers The Molitor Line         Minnesotans and Wisconsinites don\xe2\x80\x99t admit to having much in common, but in sports they have sometimes been forced to share. The most notable example is probably Paul Molitor, for whom our border is named. Molitor, a Hall of Famer from St. Paul whose name sounds conveniently similar to Maginot, played most of his career with the Brewers but finished it with the Twins. The teams\xe2\x80\x99 fans display a\xc2\xa0certain Midwestern stubbornness in keeping their allegiances roughly to state lines, with the exception of those WINOs (Wisconsinites in name only) who live just over the river from the Twin Cities. There\xe2\x80\x99s no real animosity between these two teams, given that they rarely play each other now. Still, don\xe2\x80\x99t put the peace at risk by bringing up Brett Favre.     Chicago Cubs vs. Chicago White Sox The Red Line Red Line         Helped by the charm of their field and by WGN\xe2\x80\x99s national broadcast reach, the Cubs have always been the better-loved of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s two teams. But the White Sox \xe2\x80\x94 unlike the Mets or the A\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 do have a patch of their own territory, on the city\xe2\x80\x99s South Side and into the southern suburbs. Interstate 290 (the Dwight D. Eisenhower Expressway) is a rough guide to the border: Know whether you\'re north or south of it before you put on your hat.     Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Los Angeles Angels The Reagan-Nixon Line         Among all the second-favorite teams \xe2\x80\x94 including the Mets, the A\xe2\x80\x99s and the White Sox \xe2\x80\x94 the Angels have done perhaps the best job of carving out a niche of fans. But despite the inroads made by the Angels, the Dodgers are still the clear favorite in Southern California. Their territory extends east to Big Bear Lake and west to Seal Beach. Also perhaps in the Dodgers\xe2\x80\x99 favor: The Ronald Reagan Library is in their territory, while the Angels have the Richard Nixon Library.     San Francisco Giants vs. Oakland Athletics Giant Country         Like the Mets, the Athletics are the less popular team in a two-team region \xe2\x80\x94 less popular everywhere in that region, based on the data from Facebook. Again, winning the World Series matters. The Giants have won two of the last four. The A\xe2\x80\x99s have won none of the last 24.     Oh, Ohio On to Columbus         Few states give their fans as many options as Ohio does. A fair-weather fan in the central part of the state could claim allegiance to several teams within a day\xe2\x80\x99s drive: not just the Reds and the Indians but the Cubs, the White Sox, the Pirates, the Tigers or even the Cardinals. But most Ohioans stay loyal to the home-state teams, and the border is right where you\'d guess. It runs straight though Columbus, Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s capital and largest city, in the middle of the state. One small exception to the Reds\xe2\x80\x99 and Indians\xe2\x80\x99 dominance: The longtime presence of the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 top minor league team in Toledo \xe2\x80\x94 the Mud Hens, the favorite team of Corporal Klinger from the television show ""M*A*S*H"" \xe2\x80\x94 has helped the Tigers claim some territory in northern Ohio.     St. Louis Cardinals vs. Kansas City Royals The Denkinger Line         The Show Me State has mostly thrown in with the Cardinals, who have been as good for the last two decades as the Royals have been bad. The line is well west of the halfway point between the two cities \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0Columbia, Mo. \xe2\x80\x94 and instead runs through Sedalia and Pittsburg. We can only guess what this map would have looked like in 1985, when a missed call by Umpire Don Denkinger helped the Royals win their last World Series, over the Cardinals. Unfortunately, there\xe2\x80\x99s no Facebook map for that: Mark Zuckerberg was not yet 2 years old.     New York Mets vs. Philadelphia Phillies The Sub-Hoagie Line         A common mistake in data analysis is to confuse correlation with causation; just because things are related doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean one caused the other. At the same time, last year\'s New York Times analysis of American dialects allows us to notice a striking pattern: Which N.L. East team you root for may be revealed by whether you call long sandwiches subs or hoagies. We don\'t know which causes which, but we do know they go together.* (Because of a mapping error, an earlier version of this map incorrectly characterized Trenton residents as Mets fans who eat hoagies. They appear to be Phillies fans or Yankees fans who eat hoagies.)     Houston Astros vs. Texas Rangers The Nolan Ryan Line         The state of Texas belongs to the Rangers, and why not? The team claims to represent the whole state, whereas the Astros belong merely to Houston, at least going by their name. It doesn\'t hurt that the Rangers have made the postseason three times in four years, while the Astros, who have been dreadful for several years, can\'t decide on a logo or even seemingly what league they\'re in. Many Houstonians also take pride in being a bit different from other Texans. Those other Texans apparently agree.     Washington Nationals vs. Baltimore Orioles The Line of Potomac Aggression         After the departure of the Senators in 1971, Washingtonians spent decades alternately lamenting their plight and treating the Orioles as their home team. That era is over. While the Orioles have held onto many Maryland suburbs, the Nats now dominate Washington and much of the Virginia suburbs. In parts of the Washington region, the Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t even the second-favorite team; the Yankees or the Red Sox are.     Chicago Cubs vs. St. Louis Cardinals The Downstate Line         Most states with a team have few areas that side with an out-of-state rival. Not so in Illinois, where half the state stands in open revolt. Bloomington, Champaign and Peoria appear to belong to the Cubs, but south of those cities, expect to see a lot of Cardinal red. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a longtime resident of this area, you may want to look up whether your ancestors voted for or against Abraham Lincoln in 1860.     Baltimore Orioles vs. Philadelphia Phillies The Morgan-Ripken Line         The South may have lost the Civil War, but the Orioles have done a better job of pushing north above the Mason-Dixon line than the Phillies have done expanding beyond their home state. Notably, the Orioles have won over Gettysburg, Pa. We\xe2\x80\x99ve named the Orioles-Phillies border for two of the protagonists in the 1983 World Series, which the Orioles won in five games.      Southern California Highway 1 Passport         Southern California is a group of small nation-states. San Luis Obispo, often considered a halfway point between the Giants and the Dodgers, is squarely Dodgers territory, according to Facebook users.  Further south, the Padres have problems. The baseball writer Joe Sheehan has noted their major challenges in raising revenue, given that they are hemmed in by the Pacific Ocean, the Mexican border, a desert and the Dodgers and the Angels. No one symbolizes the plight of the Padres, who have never won a World Series, quite as well as Adrian Gonzalez. Born in San Diego, he spent five years as a Padres slugger. But they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford him, and he now leads the Dodgers in home runs.             /*refer css*/       #g-refers {         overflow: hidden;         width: 100%;         margin: auto;         padding: 0;         color: #CCC;         border-top: 1px solid #dbdbdb;         margin-top: 60px;       }       #g-refers .g-refer-text {         margin: 20px 0 20px;         width: 100%;         clear: both;       }       .tinyportrait #g-refers .g-refer-text.g-clearfix {         width: 70%;         margin: 20px auto;       }       #g-refers a {         color: #333;       }       #g-refers a:hover {         text-decoration: none;         color: #333;       }       #g-refers a:hover p {         /*color: #fff !important;*/         text-decoration: underline;       }       #g-refers h2 {         font: 400 22px/28px ""Circular std"", CircularBlack, nyt-franklin, helvetica, arial;         margin-bottom: 6px;         color: #fff;       }       #g-refers h3 {         font: 200 16px/22px ""Circular std"", CircularBlack, nyt-franklin, helvetica, arial;         width: 100%;         margin-bottom: 10px;         color: #fff;       }       #g-refers h4 {       clear: both;       font: 200 14px/22px ""nyt-franklin"", arial;       text-transform: uppercase;       width: 100%;       color: #333;       font-weight: 300;       font-size: 17px;       letter-spacing: 1px;       }       #g-refers h5 {         font: normal 12px/12px nyt-franklin, Helvetica, Arial;         text-transform: uppercase;         margin: 8px 0;         font-weight: 700;       }       #g-refers h5 > span {       color: #555;       display: block;       margin-left: 0;       padding-left: 0;       font-weight: 300;       text-transform: none;       margin-top: 6px;       }       #g-refers p {         font: normal 14px/20px nyt-franklin, Helvetica, Arial;         max-width: 700px;       }       #g-refers .g-refer {         margin: 10px auto;         width: 100%;         /*max-width: 230px;*/       }       .viewport-small-10 #g-refers .g-refer {         float: left;         width: 43%;         margin: 10px 5% 0px 0;       }       .viewport-medium #g-refers .g-refer {       width: 22.5%;       margin: 20px 3% 0px 0;       }        .viewport-medium #g-refers .g-refer:last-child {         margin-right: 0;       }        #g-refers .g-refer p {         color: #333;         font-size: 17px;         font-family: \'nyt-franklin\', arial, sans-serif;         font-weight: 300;       }       #g-refers .g-credits {         margin-top: 20px;         max-width: 380px;       }       #g-refers .g-credits p {         margin: 4px auto;         font: normal 12px/16px nyt-franklin, Helvetica, Arial;         color: #666;       }       #g-refers > .g-icon {         display: block;         margin: 40px 0;       }       #g-refers > img {         width: 100%;         display: block;         margin: 40px auto 20px;       }        More From The Upshot \xc2\xbb How Birth Year Influences Political ViewsIs It Better to Rent or Buy?The Premier League Standings if Only Goals by English Players CountedWhich Team Do You Cheer For?

04/24/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: \\u201cHey, Dad\\u2026you wanna have a catch?\\u201d', 'Any kid of my generation, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re a Baltimore Orioles fan or not, knows the movie\xc2\xa0Field of Dreams. I was a child of eight years old when it came out in theaters in 1989, however my Dad took me to see it. To this day, it\xe2\x80\x99s my all-time favorite movie; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard many people my age say the same thing. So I was more than a bit interested when I read this article\xc2\xa0today, saying that the cast of the movie will be having a reunion over Father\xe2\x80\x99s Day weekend (June 13-15th) this year at the\xc2\xa0Dyersville, Iowa farm where the movie was originally filmed. (And yes for the record, the baseball field is still there.)The reunion will include the movie being shown in center field, followed by a Q & A with the actors themselves. the only cast members that are already announced as being a part of the festivities are Kevin Costner (Ray Kinsella), Timothy Busfield (who played Kinsella\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law, Mark), and Dwier Brown (John Kinsella). The weekend will also include a daylong baseball tournament on June 14th in which cast members and other celebrities will act as managers. Among other events, fathers and sons will be invited down to the field to \xe2\x80\x9chave a catch\xe2\x80\x9d over the course of the weekend.Let me be not-the-first to say that this is a great idea. While there can be no question that\xc2\xa0Field of Dreams is a special movie to IowansCourtesy of Brace Hemmelgarn-USA TODAY Sportsmore so than anyone else, it also rings very real in Baltimore as well. Oriole Park at Camden Yards was in the early phases of construction when the movie was released, and the memory of\xc2\xa0Field of Dreams was still very fresh in the public\xe2\x80\x99s mind when the Orioles opened the new ballpark in April of 1992. In fact as many people my age and above will remember, the closing ceremony at Memorial Stadium (September, 1991) featured the music from the now legendary baseball movie, along with the audio from perhaps my favorite snippet of the movie:The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers. It\xe2\x80\x99s been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field, this game, is a part of our past, Ray. It reminds us of all that once was good, and it could be again.This is not to say that you have to be of my generation to like Field of Dreams, as I feel that the message and the motifs are certainly timeless. Different people can certainly take away different things from the story, from\xc2\xa0treasure your past while you have it, to\xc2\xa0don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid to dare to dream. And perhaps we all forget those things among others at various times in our lives.Needless to say, I think that baseball probably has more aspects of popular culture tied to it than any other sport, from movies such as\xc2\xa0Field of Dreams, to songs such as John Fogerty\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Centerfield. However the fact is that the aforementioned quote isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a quote from a movie, as baseball has been the one constant through all the years. While those steamrollers representative of our country have rolled on, baseball has continued to mark our culture and our time.\xc2\xa0On a somewhat selfish whim, I hope that James Earl Jones (Terrence Mann) is planning to be at this event. The character of Terrence Mann all but made the movie, and by that I mean that the incredible job Jones did in character was the key. And obviously what event surrounding this movie would be complete without Ray Liotta (\xe2\x80\x9cShoeless Joe\xe2\x80\x9d Jackson) hitting Kevin Cosner\xe2\x80\x99s curve ball up the middle?! It should be a great event, and I certainly look forward to hearing about it when the time comes. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('The Baltimore Orioles bullpen being overworked again', 'Photo: Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY SportsOn Wednesday, Orioles ace Chris Tillman had a rare rough outing, giving up seven earned runs and failing to get through six innings. Once Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s day was done, the bullpen was called on to get the last ten outs. They came through allowing one run in 4 1/3 innings on route to an Orioles victory, but used four pitchers in the process. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubting the Orioles have talent in their bullpen, but as the starters continue their short outings, can the bullpen keep this pace?One of the main concerns for the Orioles coming into the season was the starters\xe2\x80\x99 inability to go deep into games. In today\xe2\x80\x99s game it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue for a lot of teams. However, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubting it\xe2\x80\x99s been a major issue for the Orioles over the last few years. \xc2\xa0In 2013, the rotation threw just 939 innings, which was 11th in the American League. They also had only two complete games and Chris Tillman was the lone 200 inning starter. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of innings for any bullpen, but it\xe2\x80\x99s especially difficult for a contending team whose bullpen has to throw in a lot of high-pressure situations. So far this season, the Orioles have continued that trend of short starter outings.There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that Tillman has emerged as the ace and has begun the season in the All-Star form Orioles fans saw last season. However, in five games this season, Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s pitched into the seventh only twice. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine the Orioles are too concerned about Tillman of all the starters, and his short outings are probably a product of an unusual number of foul balls. Their concern should be with the other starters.It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to\xc2\xa0find flaws\xc2\xa0with pitchers coming off back-to-back solid seasons, but both Miguel Gonzalez and Wei-Yin Chen have hardly been innings-eaters throughout their tenure with the Orioles despite their success.\xc2\xa0 In 28 starts last season, Gonzalez averaged only 6 1/3 innings. So far this season, he\xe2\x80\x99s pitched six innings only once. Chen, on the other hand, averaged less than six in 23 starts last season, and has averaged a shade over five in four starts this year.There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the Orioles were well aware of the struggles Gonzalez and Chen have had getting deep into games. Inserting Ubaldo Jimenez into the rotation was meant to take some of the pressure off those two and push them lower in the rotation.\xc2\xa0 However, thus far in the season, Jimenez has been far from the stopper that the Orioles hoped for. In four starts Jimenez has pitched six innings only once and has a disastrous 6.75 ERA. Jimenez may be better than that ERA, but he pitched only 182 innings in 32 starts last season so the Orioles shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be expecting him to turn into an innings-eater.So far the Orioles are 28th in the league starters\xe2\x80\x99 IP, and only have three starts of at least seven innings. That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not good enough for a contending team. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s early, and the Orioles should see more quality innings from starters other than Tillman. However, without a lot of innings-eaters on the staff, the Orioles bullpen could be taxed all season. The bullpen has been solid, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be difficult to pitch that many innings and keep that pace for the rest of the season. The good news for the Orioles is they have quality pitching depth in AAA if they need to give anyone a break. The bad news is they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of flexibility in their roster, and numerous roster moves are going to be difficult. As Orioles fans have seen in the last two seasons, contending teams play in a lot of close games. The Orioles bullpen will need to be fresh if they want quality innings late in the season.\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Connie Marrero, Popular Pitcher in Cuban Baseball, Dies at 102', '     Supported by    Baseball  Connie Marrero, 102, Dies; Pitcher Starred in Cuba and the Majors  By RICHARD GOLDSTEINAPRIL 23, 2014    Continue reading the main story Share This Page  Continue reading the main story                if (             window.magnum             && window.magnum.getFlags().indexOf(\'headlineBalancer\') > 0             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.shouldRun()         ) {             window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize();         }         Photo       Connie Marrero, who had an unusual delivery, pitched five seasons for the Washington Senators.

04/25/2014,"[('David Lough Gets High Marks in Baltimore Orioles Victory', '\xc2\xa0Apr 24, 2014; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Baltimore Orioles Nick Markakis is greeted at home plate by left fielder David Lough after both scoring in the seventh inning in Wednesday nightDavid Lough demonstrated his wide range of skills in leading the Baltimore Orioles to another come-from-behind victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. Lough was 3-for-4 with a walk, stole two bases (manufacturing a run with a steal of second and tag to third), had an outfield assist on a play at the plate, and made two excellent catches in the outfield.This is the style of play that was touted as Lough\xe2\x80\x99s strength when traded from the Royals for Danny Valencia. But a spring training incident with concussion-like symptoms has kept Lough down low \xe2\x80\xa6 until last night.But there were more heroes in the orange and black that made possible the very type of win we all expected would be a part of Baltimore Orioles baseball for the 2014 season. For the second consecutive evening, a Baltimore pitcher fell behind early in the game and battled back from a bad inning to hold the Jays under control until the bats came alive.Starter Bud Norris gave up a pair of 2nd-inning homers, including a two-run shot to Orioles killer Colby Rasmus, to give the Jays a 3-0 lead.\xc2\xa0 And as he did in his previous start, Toronto starter Drew Hutchinson showed great stuff and talent, mowing down the Baltimore Orioles with nine strikeouts in his six innings. But Jonathon Schoop took Hutchinson\xe2\x80\x99s first pitch of the fifth inning and made a souvenir out of it on a screamer that cleared the playing area as fast as could ever be seen. The Lough-manufactured run also scored that inning to cut the deficit to 3-2.But the Orioles would eat alive the Jays bullpen on this evening, scoring nine more runs on the way to an 11-4 win. All of the Birds lineup other than Ryan Flaherty contributed in a 14-hit attack. Both Adam Jones and Chris Davis had three RBIs, while Matt Wieters and Nelson Cruz added to their substantial early season totals with two each. The scoring was accomplished with the baseball beauty of closely-grouped hits that had the Orioles circling the bases.These past two wins are demonstrative of the compositional character of this team. On most nights, if the pitchers can hold the opponent reasonably under control, The O\xe2\x80\x99s offense is eventually going to outscore them.The Baltimore Orioles return home from this seven-game road trip that marks the completion of the first major section of the season. It was anticipated to be a tough stretch against all the AL East opponents and the Detroit Tigers. The Birds are 11-10 in the 22-game stretch, with a rainout to be made up later. Given the loss of Manny Machado, the relative absence of power hitting, and the poor starting pitching, the Orioles are actually in good shape to have the record they possess at this time. Baltimore has played 13 of their 21 games on the road.At home this weekend, the Orioles will play a three-game series against the Kansas City Royals. KC was beaten by the Indians last night 5-1, and they have opened the season with a 10-11 record. First baseman Eric Hosmer and short stop Alcides Escobar are off to great starts, hitting .301 and .300 respectively. DH Billy Butler is having the opposite experience, batting just .195 with only two doubles as all of his extra base hits in 77 at bats.The series will also feature the return of former Oriole Danny Valencia, who is 3-for-11 with a homer in four games so far this year.The Baltimore Orioles will be facing a very good 22-year-old pitcher named Yorlando Ventura. This will be only his seventh career start and game, with a current ERA of 3.05 in 32 innings. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s intimidated! This will be his fourth start this season. After giving up only one run in 13 combined innings against the Rays and Texans, the Twins got to him in his last outing for four runs in four innings.The Orioles will counter with Ubaldo Jimenez. So yes, the game is a battle between Yorlando and Ubaldo. I wonder if Dominicans make fun of American names in baseball blogs down there!Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s $50 million man has not had a good experience so far this season. He is yet to have a good game in his previous four starts, and he comes into this game with a record of 0-3 and ERA of 6.75.\xc2\xa0 He clearly does not like cold weather, and sadly the forecast is for 56 degrees at game time with a 70% chance of rain.Jimenez is 4-2 over nine career starts against the Royals. Hosmer has good numbers against him, being 8-for-22 with a pair of homers. Butler is 6-for-22 with a homer. Most of the rest of the Royals hitters have been pretty well managed by Ubaldo\xe2\x80\xa6ABH2B3BHRRBIBBSOBABilly Butler226101354.273Alcides Escobar233200423.130Eric Hosmer228002644.364Alex Gordon235000126.217Mike Moustakas234200028.174Omar Infante163010403.188Salvador Perez132000001.154Jarrod Dyson62100024.333Danny Valencia61000001.167 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Uni-Wire: Baltimore Orioles 2014 Uniform', 'Next1 of 7Prev postUse your \xe2\x86\x90 \xe2\x86\x92 (arrows) to browseMar 31, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles teammates Nelson Cruz (23) and Jonathan Schoop (6) celebrate after an opening day baseball game against the Boston Red Sox at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

The Orioles are the dominant team, in terms of percentage of fans, in the Baltimore metro region, with the Nationals gaining a stronghold in D.C. suburbs and the Phillies only creeping across the border in the eastern Maryland towns that border Delaware.Orioles Nation stretches out west in Maryland to Cumberland, into the northeast portion of West Virginia and, somewhat ironically, Strasburg, Virginia.According to the map, the strongest concentration of Orioles fans is in southeast Baltimore and eastern Baltimore County. My study of the map revealed the highset percentage of Orioles fans in the Sparrows Point (21219), Middle River (21220), and White Marsh areas of Baltimore County, with each boasting 79 percent Orioles fans. Essex (21221) was close behind at 78 percent, and Dundalk\xe2\x80\x99s 21222 checked in at 77 percent. var adSkipCounter = 0; There\xe2\x80\x99s also a stronghold in south Baltimore and surrounding Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County neighborhoods, including Curtis Bay, (21226, checking in at 77 percent Orioles fans), and Brooklyn Park and Cherry Hill (21225, 76 percent).Much of Harford County, northern and southwestern Baltimore County, and the Westminster area also boast percentages over 70, making the areas similar Orioles strongholds.All this really confirms is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of Os fans in a lot of different places, and while we\xe2\x80\x99re talking percentage points, I imagine this will be a point of pride for those areas where Orioles fandom is the highest.It does confirm, however, that all the Nattitude in the world hasn\xe2\x80\x99t helped the Washington baseball club infringe on the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fan base.Here\xe2\x80\x99s what the Times wrote when describing what they called, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Line of Potomac Aggression\xe2\x80\x9d:""While the Orioles have held onto many Maryland suburbs, the Nats now dominate Washington and much of the Virginia suburbs. In parts of the Washington region, the Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t even the second-favorite team; the Yankees or the Red Sox are.\xe2\x80\x9dGiven the growing number of people who live in the Baltimore-Washington but aren\xe2\x80\x99t from here, it makes sense that the Red Sox and Yankees occupy the runner-up spots on the poll.What\xe2\x80\x99s a little less explicable, however, is the large percentage of Yankee fans in western Maryland.

The basic premise of this film, for all who have not seen this movie yet, is about the Athletics general manager, Billy Beane, doing something that was new to baseball at the current time: using statistical data to analyze and place value on the players he picked for the team. The main statistic Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt, emphasizes is the particular player\xe2\x80\x99s on-base percentage (OBP). Beane only cares about runners getting on base whether that is from a walk or a hit and getting the opposing pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s pitch count up early.The Baltimore Orioles could take a page out of this movie. Yes, they have scored the sixth most runs in Major League Baseball (102) and have the second highest collective batting average among all Major League ball clubs (.274). Nobody is denying their offensive output. Yet, there are two alarming stat lines that Orioles fans should be concerned about.StrikeoutsThe Baltimore Orioles have three players in the top 25 for most strikeouts in the American League. Chris Davis is tied for 10th place with 24 K\xe2\x80\x99s already this season. Adam Jones and Jonathan Schoop are tied for 22nd with 21 K\xe2\x80\x99s a piece. Davis had an alarming 199 strikeouts last season, which is probably part of the reason why he ended up third in the AL MVP voting and not higher. Davis is trying to not reach that number again this season.Jones, especially, is striking out in crucial situations. All the pitches he appears to be swinging at for the third strike are low and away. I am not sure why, but he just cannot seem to lay off of this pitch. In the past Toronto series, Jones had bases loaded with two outs and struck out on three pitches (the last two pitches being low and away). The rapidness at which Jones decides to swing at pitches leads nicely into the second category the O\xe2\x80\x99s are having trouble in.Pitches per Plate AppearanceEveryone who follows the Orioles knows they are not afraid to swing the bat. However, this lack of fear can be detrimental to the Orioles in certain situations. It surely was when Jones was up to bat with bases loaded and two outs. In that case, Jones should have worked the count and at least waited for the pitcher to throw a ball in the strike zone. All three of the balls Jones swung at were clearly out of the [strike] zone. If he had not swung, he would be looking at a 3-0 count and the odds of him walking and scoring in a run would have gone up without question.Currently the Orioles have six players in the American League Top 40 for least amount of pitches seen per plate appearance on average.Steve Lombardozzi (ranked 4th) sees 3.30 pitches per plate appearance.Jonathan Schoop (ranked 16th) sees 3.52 pitches per plate appearance.Matt Wieters (ranked 26th) sees 3.64 pitches per plate appearance.Nelson Cruz (ranked 27th) sees 3.65 pitches per plate appearance.Adam Jones (ranked 28th) sees 3.66 pitches per plate appearance.Nick Markakis (ranked 37th) sees 3.80 pitches per plate appearance.I know it may seem to some that this is a pointless stat, but when the Orioles have runners in scoring position and the next batter swings at the first pitch and pops it up to end the inning, this stat becomes extremely relevant. So Orioles listen up! Be patient. Don\xe2\x80\x99t chase any balls out of the strike zone. Wait for your pitch.

A former Baltimore Oriole is facing a multi-million dollar lawsuit. A woman claims Alfredo Simon raped her in a posh Washington, D.C. hotel. Mike Hellgren spoke to the accuser\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer and has all sides of this disturbing case. His accuser says former Orioles pitcher Alfredo Simon, now with the Cincinnati Reds, had a friend approach her at a club a year ago. Simon then brought her back to his posh hotel room near the White House and allegedly raped her. Her civil lawsuit WJZ obtained claims he: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6abruptly changed his behavior from a romantic encounter to a terrifying physical attack. As soon as [he] started to get rough with her, [she] told him to stop. [He] ignored that plea, pinning [her] down on her stomach while she struggled and continued to demand [he] get off her.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very brutal and graphic and produced very real injuries, which were documented,\xe2\x80\x9d the accuser\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, Steve Kelly, said. Prosecutors in D.C. convened a grand jury, but declined to press criminal charges with no explanation. \xe2\x80\x9cBased on what happened to her, I think she would definitely say that he\xe2\x80\x99s a danger to others,\xe2\x80\x9d Kelly said.  Simon was a pitcher with the Orioles, ending in 2011. He had a brush with the law during his tenure here. In 2011, police in Simon\xe2\x80\x99s native Dominican Republic filed an involuntary manslaughter charge against him after he fired celebratory gunshots in the air that killed a man. Simon was later acquitted and spoke to WJZ about that incident. \xe2\x80\x9cI just try to play baseball. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think about whatever happened. Just put it behind me,\xe2\x80\x9d Simon said. In the rape lawsuit, the accuser is seeking $15 million in damages, but says it\xe2\x80\x99s not about the money. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a situation where we have a gold digger or publicity seeker. This is an educated, very credible young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kelly. Simon\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer calls the allegations baseless. He says he will fight them aggressively and believes his client will be fully exonerated. The accuser\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer says she did have a rape kit done at the police department that showed abrasions. Simon denies wrongdoing.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have added Jemile Weeks to the 25-man roster to bolster their infield choices in the wake of the oblique injury to Chris Davis. Weeks will trade places from AAA Norfolk with T.J. McFarland, who pitched three innings last evening. This brings the pitching staff back to the more normal total of 12 arms rather than 13.For one, I certainly applaud this move, having been a long-term skeptic of Ryan Flaherty. Without doubt, Flaherty gives the Orioles more options as a plus-defender in varied positions, along with more occasional power. But Weeks has, in my view, the greater upside potential for much higher offensive production, especially with average, on base percentage, and speed.Flaherty has struggled terribly to produce much offense for the Orioles thus far in 2014 (currently hitting .183, and .216 career), whereas Weeks has been ripping the ball quite well at Norfolk, hitting .296, and with 16 walks putting up an OBP of .451.

Obviously the Orioles would like to see him return to his form from 2011. There is certainly no guarantee that this could happen, though it seems to me that his chances of becoming an effective MLB player are enhanced by his undeniable athleticism. If he did it in the recent past and there is nothing physically different from that time, why can it not happen again in the right environment?YearAgeTmLgGABRH2B3BHRRBISBCSBBSOBAOBPSLG201124OAKAL974065012326823622112162.303.340.421201225OAKAL11844454981582201655070.221.305.304201326OAKAL893100000005.111.111.1113 Yrs2238591072224116456381671137.258.319.357\xc2\xa0Weeks is already off to a good start as an Orioles player.

I like this guy and would like to see him in Baltimore for a while to come. Run Jemile, run. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles lose game - and perhaps Chris Davis', 'The least of Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x98s concerns is the fact that the Baltimore Orioles were blanked by Kansas City last night, 5-0. Teams lose games all the time. The fact is that when you play 162 games, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have some clunkers in the mix. If you think about it, this game kind of set up well in Kansas City\xe2\x80\x99s favor; they had a young guy named Yordano Ventura on the mound who threw straight heat, and there was in essence no book on him. Ventura was impressive, however I will say that if he wants to have success at the big league level in the long run he\xe2\x80\x99ll need to develop some off speed pitches.That aside, Ubaldo Jimenez struggled with his control early in the game once again, which is turning into a problem for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 6 H, 4 R, 4 BB, 3 K. However to his credit Jimenez did appear to make progress in terms of righting himself as the game wore on. Brett Butler gave Kansas City the lead in the first inning with an RBI-single (following a walk and a single). Alex Gordon followed up with a single of his own, and Jimenez and the O\xe2\x80\x99s trailed 2-0. However again, Jimenez settled down a bit and somehow made it into the seventh inning \xe2\x80\x93 which saved a few bullpen relievers. Kansas City would put another run across in the 7th on an RBI-single before Jimenez would leave the game, and then T.J. McFarland would allow an inherited runner to score to run the lead to 4-0. Brett Butler would line an RBI-double to right in ninth to close out the scoring and the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 5-0 loss to Kansas City.But neither that, or the miracle that the teams got last night\xe2\x80\x99s game in (following a 50-minute rain delay) given the weather conditions is the big story from last night. The Orioles removedCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsChris Davis from the lineup in the top of the fifth inning with an apparent oblique strain. Manager Buck Showalter had informed reporters in Toronto that Davis was bothered by some pain in his hip, although he was playing through it. However last night I suppose that pain got to be too much. Obviously this is something that could turn into a serious hitch in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 giddyup in terms of the lineup and the batting order.The first question is what will the Orioles do? And that remains to be seen. Last night Davis seemed to suggest that he wanted to wait until he came in today to see how he felt, which makes sense. But following last night\xe2\x80\x99s game the Orioles optioned reliever T.J. McFarland back to Norfolk, which would lead one to believe that they\xe2\x80\x99re probably going to call up a middle infielder. Ryan Flaherty took over at first base in the game last night, however whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cthe guy\xe2\x80\x9d in the long term is another story. Oblique strains can sometimes send players to the 15-day DL, and other times it\xe2\x80\x99s a mere few days and the player is able to get back into the lineup. However the fact that the Orioles already sent McFarland (who was called up as an extra reliever to begin with) out tells me that they\xe2\x80\x99re anticipating a DL stint for Davis.And go figure that the O\xe2\x80\x99s would have literally just sent Steve Pearce out earlier this week because he would have probably been the perfect guy to play first if necessary. Obviously if Peace somehow clears waivers he could go back to Baltimore, however in the interim I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s an option. Norfolk first baseman Chris Marrero is hitting .201 with two homers thus far, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s an option either. Nick Markakis of course has also played some first base, however I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if that\xe2\x80\x99s the right fix either. Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to have to wait and see if Davis truly ends up going to the DL. If not, then perhaps they could get along for a few days (especially with an off day on Monday) with Flaherty or even Markakis playing first.While Davis is in the lineup mainly for his bat, the one thing that\xe2\x80\x99s lost here is that he\xe2\x80\x99s only hit two homers this season thus far. And the O\xe2\x80\x99s have held their head above water with that production; so while this is not to knock Davis (because he\xe2\x80\x99s produced in other areas such as walks), if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to replace him in the batting order this might be the time to do it and still have a legitimate shot at maintaining the status quo. Perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s the Moneyball way of looking at things, but it does sound a bit better than the Orioles have to replace 53 home runs in the lineup. The series with Kansas City continues tonight, with the O\xe2\x80\x99s sending southpaw Wei-Yin Chen out to the mound. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by former Oriole and fan favorite Jeremy Guthrie.

Now, with the advanced technology of magnetic resonance imaging, the more specific terminology of \xe2\x80\x9coblique\xe2\x80\x9d has entered the mainstream reporting about this core injury.Relative to other sports, baseball calls for a tremendous amount of rotational strain of the twisting and turning of the torso. Add to this the greater strength training of the modern athlete that increases these strains and forces, and at some point the muscle tissue is unable to absorb the activity.As this injury seemed to grab the headlines so frequently in recent years, dropping more than a few famous players on the DL for extended times, baseball trainers and therapists began to research the issue more specifically. In 2011, the L.A. Dodgers trainer did an extensive 20-year study of baseball injuries. He did discover that there was some general increase in frequency over that time. But a more interesting statistic to rise from his research was that a full one-third of these oblique injuries happen in the month of April, seeming to suggest that many players are not ready at the front of the season for the stresses and strains of the regular season.As with any kind of strain, there are degrees of breakdown and severity of condition. In any event, it really, really hurts! Some players who have had a bad case of oblique strains talk about it hurts to even absorb the pounding of walking, and having to sneeze is about the single most painful experience in life.The injury is notoriously frustrating to rehab and return from inactivity \xe2\x80\x93 without a setback or worse. And the rehab portion of it simply involves a lot of rest \xe2\x80\x93 frustrating for the typical male who wants to \xe2\x80\x9cdo something to fix this problem.\xe2\x80\x9dAll the talk sounds like Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 particular case in on the less severe end of the spectrum. But what I believe can be read into Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s remarks about not actually expecting Davis back and playing two weeks from today is simply that no oblique injury actually heals up that fast.Davis says he is historically a quick healer. I guess this is a little bit like a quick sleeper \xe2\x80\x93 you know, when Buck says at the end of an evening post-game interview about the day game to follow: \xe2\x80\x9csleep fast.\xe2\x80\x9dIn any event, we are going to see some maneuvering and different players in different places. Nick Markakis looks pretty good at first base. That seems like a sufficient solution to me. Manny Machado might be back a few days earlier than most recently believed \xe2\x80\x93 so there is some good news.The best day however will be the one where we look around the infield and see Chris Davis, Jonathon Schoop, J.J. Hardy, and Manny Machado. That is the infield we\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for, but may have to wait a bit longer to see.

An \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d grade was worth four, a \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d three, down the line to zero points for an \xe2\x80\x9cF\xe2\x80\x9d grade.The Orioles team of Thorne and Palmer earned 629 \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d votes, 532 \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d votes, 179 \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d votes, 49 \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d votes, and 48 \xe2\x80\x9cF\xe2\x80\x9d votes for a \xe2\x80\x9cGPA\xe2\x80\x9d of 3.14. var adSkipCounter = 0; Given that most voters would only be familiar with their own local broadcasts, it reflects an overwhelming positivity towards the MASN booth among Orioles fans.Thorne, a former attorney and a six-year veteran in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 booth, has announced baseball for nearly three decades. He\xe2\x80\x99s also well-known among hockey fans for his work on ESPN when the network still carried the sport, and he\xe2\x80\x99s well respected by fans inside and out of the industry.And even if Palmer wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the impressive analyst he is, it\xe2\x80\x99d be difficult for Orioles fans to grade him badly. The Hall of Fame pitcher earned three Cy Young awards and made five All-Star teams in his 19-year career.Outside of Thorne and Palmer, the top three has a decidedly local flavor. Former Orioles voice Jon Miller, whose ouster in 1996 as the team\xe2\x80\x99s broadcaster ended a 13-year stint in the city and elicited protests at Camden Yards, came in first in his latest role in San Francisco.Miller signed on to call games in his hometown just after leaving the Orioles, and along with fellow play-by-play men Duane Kuiper and Dave Flemming, and analyst Mike Krukow, the former ESPN Sunday Night Baseball announcer earned the top spot with a \xe2\x80\x9cGPA\xe2\x80\x9d of 3.46.Legendary Los Angeles Dodgers television voice Vin Scully, as well as his substitutes Charley Steiner and Orel Hershiser, came in second with a 3.41 GPA.Thorne and Palmer\xe2\x80\x99s MASN colleagues, Bob Carpenter and F.P. Santangelo, didn\xe2\x80\x99t fare as well in the rankings. The Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 announce team had the second-highest number of \xe2\x80\x9cF\xe2\x80\x9d votes, only behind the wholly unlovable Hawk Harrelson in Chicago, en route to a 1.79 GPA and 27th place.But let\xe2\x80\x99s not dwell on the negative. Third place for Messrs. Thorne and Palmer is well deserved, but what do you think?

Steinbrenner Field. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsAs the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching continues to struggle, it is becoming more and more evident that something will have to change. Ranking 12th in the AL in ERA and 11th in total runs allowed is not a characteristic of a playoff team. Ubaldo Jimenez (0-4, 6.59), Miguel Gonzalez (1-2, 5.19) and Bud Norris (1-2, 4.44) have all failed to pitch deep and effectively into games and it has wreaked havoc on the bullpen, which also has been letting the team down of late.Evan Meek (0-1, 6.75), Josh Stinson (0-0, 7.25), Brian Matusz (1-1, 5.40), and Ryan Webb (0-0, 5.00) have exacerbated the issues created by the rotation, resulting in a domino-effect that has overworked the bullpen just one month into the season. Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s loss to the Kansas City Royals exemplified the pitching staff\xe2\x80\x99s struggles thus far into the season.How will the Orioles fix this problem? It is highly likely that two internal solutions to this problem could help alleviate the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching woes. Norfolk Tides pitchers Suk-min Yoon and Kevin Gausman both are seen to be potential rotation options, but equally important, they are also bullpen options.Yoon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have eye-popping numbers in his four starts in the Triple-A. Sporting an 0-3 record with a 6.75 ERA, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 most recent major international signing out of Japan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be an obvious choice. However, after a very rough introduction to American baseball in his first two starts (6.2 IP, 12 ER), Yoon has begun to settle in a bit. Yoon\xe2\x80\x99s last two starts saw him give up just 1 ER in 10.2 IP. Though, he allowed 16 hits and 2 BBs, 1 ER in 10.2 IP is very notable and hopefully will play into a boost in confidence and a sense of belonging in American baseball. He was signed to be a major leaguer, and that is still the intention. He seems more likely to see time in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen before any rotation spot is considered. Like Yoon, Gausman has also bounced back from a few rough starts.Last year, Gausman established himself as a useful member of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen after struggling in the rotation. Despite a strong Spring Training (11 IP, 2.45), the 23-year-old was optioned to Triple-A to continue his development, and possibly to save his arm for later in the season. His sparkling first start of the season (4.2 IP, 0 ER, 6 SO) was followed by two disappointing starts (combined 7 IP, 6 ER). Thankfully, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t take Gausman long to bounce back, as he allowed no earned runs in a \xc2\xa0combined 9.2 IP in his last two starts. He will undoubtedly crack the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 25-man roster eventually in 2014, and it will be much earlier than September. His talent, and noted success out of the bullpen, make him an extremely viable solution to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching problems.One other solution is giving Zach Britton (3-0, 1.17) a shot at the rotation. That seems to be a possibility, but it would remove one of the few working parts from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 struggling bullpen. If Britton failed to be an effective starter, as he has in his previous rotation stints, it could potentially harm both the rotation and the bullpen. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mess with a good thing regarding Britton.With Chris Davis now on the 15-day DL and J.J. Hardy battling nagging injuries, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense may potentially face even greater challenges in the coming weeks, even with Manny Machado returning from his knee injury. This means that their pitchers will have even less run support to work with, therefore demanding the best possible staff. If manager Buck Showalter and executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette feel the need to make a significant change in the next few weeks, it will likely involve Yoon or Gausman. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('4/28: The Baltimore Wire- Orioles: Is Good Pitching ...', 'Waiting out a rain delay. Mandatory Credit: David Richard-USA TODAY SportsWithout doubt there is a trend over the past 15 years in MLB to see pitching becoming more dominant. Is this good or bad for the game of baseball?Here on this off day for the Baltimore Orioles, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pondering this question. Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about it for a while \xe2\x80\xa6 but a rainy day without an O\xe2\x80\x99s game gives me more reason for such contemplations.Also triggering this brain storm activity (storm / rain \xe2\x80\x93 see what I did there?) is the performance of James Shields against the Orioles yesterday. He was excellent, even factoring in the two-run homer of Nelson Cruz. Shields only gave up three hits in seven innings.But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only one to pitch that well yesterday. Here comes an amazing statistic \xe2\x80\xa6 and it is what got me writing this article. Yesterday (Sunday) was the first time in the history of MLB that, on the same day, 10 starters went seven innings or more and gave up three hits or less. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pause while that sinks in!As I said above, pitching has become more dominant in the past 15 years. It certainly feels that way. So, to check it out, I did some research and came up with this following chart of the yearly statistics in all of MLB \xe2\x80\x93 tracking batting averages and ERAs\xe2\x80\xa6YearMLB BAMLB ERA2014.2483.782013.2533.862012.2554.012011.2553.942010.2574.072009.2624.312008.2644.322007.2684.462006.2694.522005.2644.282004.2664.462003.2644.392002.2614.272001.2644.412000.2704.76\xc2\xa0Over 15 years, the batting average is now roughly about 20 points lower, with the ERA coming down now also about .75 or so.So is this good for the game? That is probably an answer that brings a response much salted with personal tastes and opinion.I will answer for myself that it is not good. And as a former pitcher, I surprise myself a bit. But honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we want to see baseball turn into the bat and ball scoring version of soccer. In my local community I am somewhat renowned for my distaste of that sport that disallows the use of two limbs, except for one player. I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually hate it nearly as much as my reputation suggests, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the low-scoring nature of that sport will allow it to ever grow to popularity in the USA that it has in other parts of the world.Here are a couple of things that I do \xe2\x80\x9cget\xe2\x80\x9d about soccer that fuels fans of that sport in their struggle to understand why anyone would like baseball. The action is continuous, even if it is a lot of passing it around far from the goal. And there is a set time for the game with few breaks \xe2\x80\x93 like between innings. And so, soccer fans think of baseball as interminable and too much suspended action between a pitcher and batter, while the rest of the players (and the fans) are waiting and waiting for something to happen.As a baseball purist, I enjoy that suspension \xe2\x80\x93 which to the observant eye is filled with action and gamesmanship of pitch selections and defensive posturing. But here\xe2\x80\x99s the point \xe2\x80\x93 low-scoring pitching battles add to the sort of (growing?) skeptical view of the sport as pictured immediately above.There was a time in the history of baseball about 45 years ago where it reached a point that something had to be done to diminish the pitching dominance of the sport. In the late 60s, the mound was lowered in order to induce more offence. It did, and the sport benefitted.Is the time coming when another modification is needed? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe.Perhaps we should also therefore ponder why this is happening \xe2\x80\xa6 what has contributed to the chart above?The answer is likely rather more complex than the two items I am going to suggest, but here goes\xe2\x80\xa61.\xc2\xa0 In the highly competitive ebb and flow of baseball at the highest level, managers and coaches have rightly understood that good pitching will far more often stop good hitting than the other way around. Therefore, a premium has been put upon the technical development of pitchers that is beyond anything known in the sport until recent years. Again, some may argue that this is a good thing.2.\xc2\xa0 The development of advanced sabermetrics and computer analyses of EVERYTHING has allowed for strategic implementation of defensive shifts to the extent that this is having a statistical effect upon the game. The Baltimore Orioles are probably one of the best, if not the very best, at utilizing this resource. Again, some may argue that this is a good thing.I would rather see the game returned to the offensive production level of 15 years ago. I think that is a more interesting game that is also more compelling to the masses of the people. So will the pendulum naturally swing back in that direction at some point? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I will say that I do not currently see anything that would generate a trend in that direction.My personal bias will come out in this final remark: If indeed the defensive shifts have contributed to this change that MLB will deem as negative, a step that could be taken would be to disallow over-shifts. I personally hate them. Why punish a player who is good enough to hit consistently to a spot not traditionally defensed? \xc2\xa0By illustration, is it really better for the game of baseball to over-shift on a guy like Chris Davis and turn him into an opposite-field slap hitter instead? The idea is not actually that far \xe2\x80\x9cout there.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 After all, the NBA disallows certain defenses for the good of that sport.So, anyhow \xe2\x80\xa6 this is a topic that perhaps some of you would have interest in commenting upon, and I\xe2\x80\x99d welcome that \xe2\x80\xa6 as it is a matter of opinion for sure. After all, it looks like we will have time for conversations over the coming days. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure when we are ever going to see baseball again in Baltimore. Between tonight (Monday) and Thursday morning, they are calling for up to five inches of rain in Maryland. The Orioles are off tonight and Thursday, with games on Tuesday and Wednesday \xe2\x80\x93 the peak periods of precipitation. All of these off days are going to make for some difficult decisions for scheduling. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are activating Manny Machado today, taking the roster spot of Chris Davis, even as they watch the rain wash away all immediate hopes of actually playing the game of baseball anytime soon.Manny Machado certainly appears to be plenty ready to resume full baseball activity by pounding out eight hits in 12 appearances for the Frederick Keys over the weekend. Even though we need to rightly remind ourselves that this is level \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d baseball, it is still impressive and worthy of encouragement.There are other pending roster moves for the Orioles. With a record of 12-12, the next game will be #25 on the season which takes Troy Patton off the restricted list. So, either tonight, or tomorrow, or Thursday, or sometime in the next couple weeks when the rain finally stops, he will presumably be back on the 25-man roster. Some relief pitcher will have to come off. My guess is that it would be Evan Meek \xe2\x80\xa6 or possibly Josh Stinson? Neither has looked especially effective lately.Beyond that, there is the possibly of the Baltimore Orioles re-signing Steve Pearce if he makes it successfully through the waiver process, which ends today I do believe. Who would he replace? I would suppose it would be Jemile Weeks, though I would send down Ryan Flaherty and see if someone at AAA can get his swing to stop resembling a golf blast out of a deep sand trap. There is nothing level about it these days; he looks like he is spelling the letter \xe2\x80\x9cU\xe2\x80\x9d with his swing.Even as I look out the window here mid afternoon on Tuesday and see a total deluge taking place, there is still a scheduled game for this evening. It is the first of two with Pittsburgh \xe2\x80\x93 the only trip to Baltimore for the Pirates this season. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if I can re-arrange life in such a way as to see a doubleheader in Baltimore on Thursday?The Pirates are not off to a very good start on the season. Their record is 10-16 and the offense ranks next to last in the NL at .221, while the team pitching ERA of 3.65 places them 10th in the NL. By contrast, the Baltimore Orioles are 4th in the AL in hitting at .265 and 12th in pitching at 4.49.Center fielder Andrew McCutchen is hitting .286, while second baseman Neil Walker has six homers while batting just .235. Those are the shining star statistics at this moment!The pitching matchup is scheduled to be 6\xe2\x80\x995\xe2\x80\x9d Charlie Morton (0-3) versus 6\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Tillman (3-1).Morton has pitched once in his career against the Orioles on June 20, 2011 in Pittsburgh. It was not a happy experience for the big right-hander. He gave up six earned runs on eight hits, as just about everyone in the lineup got a single or double \xe2\x80\x93 including Jake Arrieta, the winning pitcher, who singled in the top of the first before even getting to throw a pitch.This will be start #6 for Morton, who has a current ERA of 4.35 over 31 innings. Actually, three of his five games have been quality starts. His most recent outing was against the Reds where he allowed three runs on four hits over six innings; however he also gave up five walks.Chris Tillman will likewise be making his sixth start of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. After throwing four consecutive quality starts that had his ERA at 1.71, Tillman was lit up a bit at Toronto last Wednesday \xe2\x80\x93 giving up seven runs on nine hits in 5.2 innings.Here are Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s season and career stats up to this date \xe2\x80\xa6WLERAGIPHRERHRHBBBSOAVGWHIP2014 Stats313.38532.031141251927.2421.25MLB Career35264.2289505.04862572377912181388.2521.32\xc2\xa0Somewhat surprisingly, Tillman has never pitched against the Pirates \xe2\x80\x93 a statement that may be true for as much as another 48 hours!

The two are four years apart. He also has an older sister who ran track at Southern University. Jemile and Rickie both nearly played for the Brewers when the younger Weeks was drafted by Milwaukee in the eighth round of the draft out of high school. He declined and chose instead to play baseball for the Miami Hurricanes. While in college he played for the United States in the World University Baseball Championships. Yes, it is a thing. He helped the US team beat Chinese Taipei to take home the gold. In addition to that he was a standout at Miami. Baseball America named him a preseason All-American in 2008 and Oakland drafted him that season in the first round. Weeks has had a roller coaster ride of a professional career. He made it from college to the big leagues in a little over two seasons, playing 97 games with the Athletics in 2011. That year made Weeks look like an All-Star in the making. He hit .303 in those 97 games, had 26 doubles and showed off his wheels with 22 steals.    This caused Oakland to view him as a cornerstone of the franchise. That offseason they traded away the likes of Tevor Cahill and Gio Gonzalez, but Weeks was dubbed ""untouchable"". He came into the 2012 season as the starting second baseman and struggled.    His average dove to .221 in 118 games that season. Likely a result of him bouncing back to reality with his average on balls in play (BABIP). In 2011 he had a ridiculous BABIP of .350, in 2012 it was .256. His limited power even took a severe hit. He stopped hitting doubles; down to just 15 in 2012. The A\'s took action and set him back to the farm. He managed to bounce back to Oakland a time or two but had become an afterthought, the Athletics were moving on from their former first round pick.    And that brings us to the 2013 offseason. Billy Beane was looking to solidify his bullpen and, for once, would be able to spend some money doing it. A deal was struck with Baltimore that would land Jim Johnson in the bay area. It was mostly thought of as a salary dump on the O\'s part. But they did get Jemile Weeks and it seems that he will get some playing time in Baltimore, at least for a short period of time. Scouting Report It was once thought that Weeks carried some good pop in his little frame. Scouts projected him as a 10 home run guy that would carry a batting avererage around .280. He has fallen short on both accounts thus far. He only has four home runs over 867 at-bats and has a career .260 batting average. In terms of walking and striking out, he does both slightly below average. So, glass half full. His career walk rate is only 7.3 percent while he strikes out at a clip of 14.2 percent.    A tool that Weeks surely has is speed. In his limited time with Oakland he managed to swipe 38 bases. However, he was also thrown out 16 times. That means he is successful about two-thirds of the time; not great. But he is one of those players that can hustle a single into a double or possibly a double into a triple. Something that the Orioles sorely lack outside of David Lough. The weakest part of Weeks\' game may be his defense. He has primarily been a second baseman but has also seen time in centerfield. Fangraphs uses Ultimate Zone per 150 games to determine a players worth in the field over an entire season. In this system zero is always average. Using this, Weeks has been given a career -9.1 UZR/150. That is well below average and shows that he has poor range and his arm is regarded as well below average. What\'s Ahead Now may have been the best time for Weeks to join the Orioles. He gets a chance to show manager Buck Showalter what he can do right before Manny Machado returns to the club. Once Machado is back, decisions will have to be made. One of Weeks, Jonathan Schoop, Ryan Flaherty and Steve Lombardozzi will be packing their bags for Norfolk. In my eyes, Lombardozzi is staying put. He is a gamer and has done an admirable job. Flaherty has become the utility man who can play all four infield positions. Without him, the Orioles don\'t have a real back-up at shortstop or first base. He stays. It\'s down to Weeks and Schoop. Schoop has struggled in the field and with his patience at the plate. Though he has also shown what makes him such a highly regarded prospect with his power potential. Ultimately though, he may get squeezed for playing time. Buck would prefer to see Weeks on the bench day in and day out than top prospect Schoop.    Weeks still has options remaining and is under team control through 2019. His speed brings a needed element to the O\'s. If he can find that stroke again that enabled him to spray balls down the line for doubles he can become a productive part of the lineup. But if he doesn\'t and his defense continues to be poor then he will be nothing more than minor league fodder. What role do you think Weeks will have on the Orioles in 2014 and beyond?

MLB\'s All-Star voting is\xc2\xa0live, and you can vote for Matt Wieters, Nelson Cruz and a bunch of other Orioles who probably don\'t deserve to make the team based on what they\'ve done so far in 2014.  Watch the horrible rain-delay programming on MASN and drink until you can convince yourself that it\'s baseball. Hunt down Nick Markakis and pie him in the face so that he\'ll get over himself and participate in the team\'s fun activities on the rare occasions when he\'s responsible for a game-winning hit. Call Jim Palmer and ask him about that one time he gave up a grand slam. Report back on whether you can hear an aneurysm occur over a phone line.

I can only imagine if the Orioles had an easier schedule to start the season where they would be. The numbers have not quite shown up for the Orioles. The homeruns are right near the bottom of the AL, while they are in the top 10 for doubles and top five for triples. The offense is present, which is especially clear in Nelson Cruz who has started with a great season for the Orioles. In the few games I have watched, the consistent problem with the Orioles is the pitching. But that is not a new problem, it is the same problem the Orioles have every year. The Orioles have the fifth highest ERA in the AL and the sixth highest in the entire MLB.However, the pitching has not been walking many players, but they have not been striking out players either. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers have the highest batting average against them in the entire MLB. Overall, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching is letting down the team again.Even though Chris Tillman has a 3-1 record in five games started has a 3.38 ERA, there is the high ERA to worry about. Wei-Yin Chen has the same problem. He has a 3-1 record in five games started, but a 4.34 ERA. Ubaldo Jimenez has been a major letdown. He sits winless with an ERA reaching above six. Despite his recent struggles in his career, I was hoping he would turn it around with the Orioles, but he has yet to show he has changed. As a team, the long ball is still hurting the Orioles giving up the second most in the AL. But the Orioles have only given up the eighth most earned runs at 107. The defense, even without Manny Machado, is second in the AL in fielding percentage and second in fewest errors committed at 10. The Orioles are third in the AL with 27 double plays. As I examine the Orioles, I see that they either live or die by the long ball. The pitching has allowed more than 10 more homeruns than the Orioles have hit and that is not the way to win games. If the Orioles could improve upon just one of these aspects, the next month of baseball could be played much differently. If the pitching becomes better, I expect great things from the Orioles in the month of May, in which, I will get to watch more than the games that just play on ESPN.\xc2\xa0  ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles 2014 Season: April Review', '\xc2\xa0Apr 23, 2014; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Baltimore Orioles catcher Matt Wieters greets team mates in the Orioles dugout after hitting a home run in the seventh inning in the Orioles 10-8 win over Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre. Mandatory Credit: Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY SportsNow that the 2014 season for the Baltimore Orioles has gone through the month of April, what are the highlights so far, as well as the biggest disappointments?Actually, there may be one more game in April this evening (Wednesday 4/30), though the weather situation is not promising. The plan is for the Orioles to play the Pirates in the first of two games, with yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game now being postponed to Thursday. A preview of today\xe2\x80\x99s game \xe2\x80\x93 posted yesterday \xe2\x80\x93 can be found HERE. After beginning the season with a 6-3 record, Pittsburgh has gone 4-13 since.But in thinking back over the first month, let\xe2\x80\x99s identify both five highlights and five disappointments \xe2\x80\xa6Baltimore Orioles April HighlightsMatt Wieters resurgence \xe2\x80\x93 I believe this is the story of the year so far with the Orioles. Honestly, I did not see this coming. I had given up on Wieters as anything more than an average-hitting catcher with nice occasional power and great defensive skills. Currently Matt is hitting .338 with four homers and 15 RBIs. And he is doing it from both sides of the plate.Nelson Cruz proves to be a bargain so far \xe2\x80\x93 There is no doubt that Cruz is a great hitter, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone foresaw this month of April that he has enjoyed. His seven home runs and 25 RBIs would put him on pace for 47 homers and 169 runs knocked in! It was an offseason goal for the Orioles to solidify and enhance the DH spot in the order. Right now the Orioles are about 90-100 points higher at DH than the average in 2013.Zach Britton\xe2\x80\x99s dominance \xe2\x80\x93 That Zach Britton is often unhittable is not surprising after seeing him in spring training, but it would not have been assumed prior to that. These 95 mph sinkers are just about the nastiest looking pitches in baseball right now. Britton has a 1.17 ERA in 10 games with 15.1 innings pitched. Some folks are clamoring for him to become a starter. But at his current pace he will appear in 67-68 games instead of 30 or so as a starter. He is on pace to throw 103 innings \xe2\x80\x93 these innings being at more critical times of games than the 180 approximate total innings he would accumulate if made into a starter.Chris Tillman as staff ace \xe2\x80\x93 Even though Tillman had his worst outing in three years in his last performance, the first four starts of the season were stellar. It is clear that Tillman is the best pitcher on the staff and that his prior year-and-a-half performance was no flash in the pan. He is a legit top of the rotation sort of starter.Jonathan Schoop is not overwhelmed \xe2\x80\x93 This too is another area of pleasant surprise for me. Schoop did not drill minor league pitching last year, and his Arizona Fall League performance was very mediocre. But to be fair, he had some injury issues to overcome, and this very, very young man filled out his frame in impressive fashion. Though Schoop has had to often play out of position this season, and though he is clearly seen to be often learning on the job, the guy is certainly not in over his head whatsoever. His swing is a thing of beauty, and when he squares up a ball, it jumps off his bat. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason to not keep him in Baltimore, and that is something I would not have written only five to six weeks ago.Baltimore Orioles April DisappointmentsUbaldo Jimenez \xe2\x80\x93 So far, Jimenez has shown why the Orioles (and many other teams) are very slow to make long-term commitments to pitchers. The euphoria that immediately followed the surprising $50 million signing of Jimenez is long gone. Instead, after five starts, he has pitched only 27 innings \xe2\x80\x93 allowing 20 earned runs on 33 hits and 17 walks. Opponents are batting a perfect .300 against him, and all of this adds up to an ERA of 6.59.You know what is coming next, right? Yes, Jimenez is a notoriously slow starter in his career. What else is there to hang hopes on than that historic truth? Well, I will say that his ball movement is about as good as anyone\xe2\x80\x99s on the Orioles. However, his ability to command the baseball is the absolute worst. Too many balls drift into the sweet spots, and too many drift out of the zone altogether and put extra runners on base and add to pitch counts. This investment may yet pay off; but people with concerns are not crazy!The inability of the starters to go deep into games \xe2\x80\x93 This is not a headline. In fact, most Orioles fans would likely have chosen this out of a list of possible problems as the most likely thing to go wrong for the Birds. It is not a new problem. But, even with only 24 games in the books and basically five turns through the rotation, the trend line is improving. It needs to.The power loss of the offense \xe2\x80\x93 Would you have believed me if I told you a month ago that the Orioles would end April being out-homered by opponents 29 to 17?\xc2\xa0 Or how about this \xe2\x80\x93 Would you have believed me before opening day if I told you that Chris Davis, Adam Jones, and J.J. Hardy would only hit three home runs in their combined 253 plate appearances in April?The worst winter in recent memory has turned into the worst April for baseball in many years, and that weather has been a contributing factor. And honestly, power is not everything. The Baltimore Orioles are still the #5 offense in the American League, and they have been at the top in terms of batting average with runners in scoring position.Chris Davis injury \xe2\x80\x93 Even without the injury, Davis might have made this list. April of 2014 has looked nothing like the incredible first month of 2013 with its nine home runs. Clearly, Crush is being pitched entirely different than before \xe2\x80\x93 evidenced by his high number of walks and .372 OBP. The over-shifts are seen everywhere. Davis is going to have to make adjustments to such factors.But before he can make the adjustments, he is going to need to get back onto the field after his stint on the DL with the oblique injury. There is much uncertainty surrounding this, and one has to wonder what the long-term ramifications of this will be for a fellow of his size and strength. Will he be able to prevent a recurrence of such troubles?David Lough is too low \xe2\x80\x93 Lough is not going to be an all-star \xe2\x80\xa6 not this year. and likely not any year. But the talent appears to be there to have a productive player with a variety of skills. The concussion-like symptoms have been a setback, and I have to wonder if there was not more to that issue than was publicly known. But in any event, a recent win that was largely facilitated by Lough\xe2\x80\x99s three hits, base running, and defensive plays was a demonstration of what he is able to do to make a total difference in a game. I still think Lough is going to become a fan favorite in Baltimore, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t happen with his current .172 batting average, no matter how many highlight reel catches he makes.

Their record is 10-16 and the offense ranks next to last in the NL at .221, while the team pitching ERA of 3.65 places them 10th in the NL. By contrast, the Baltimore Orioles are 4th in the AL in hitting at .265 and 12th in pitching at 4.49.Center fielder Andrew McCutchen is hitting .286, while second baseman Neil Walker has six homers while batting just .235. Those are the shining star statistics at this moment, as the Pirates are near the bottom of most offensive categories.Game One at 4:05The pitching matchup in the afternoon game will feature 6\xe2\x80\x995\xe2\x80\x9d Charlie Morton (0-3) versus Bud Norris (1-2).Morton has pitched once in his career against the Orioles on June 20, 2011 in Pittsburgh. It was not a happy experience for the big right-hander. He gave up six earned runs on eight hits, as just about everyone in the lineup got a single or double \xe2\x80\x93 including Jake Arrieta, the winning pitcher, who singled in the top of the first before even getting to throw a pitch.This will be start #6 for Morton, who has a current ERA of 4.35 over 31 innings. Actually, three of his five games have been quality starts. His most recent outing was against the Reds where he allowed three runs on four hits over six innings; however he also gave up five walks.The Orioles will send Budd Norris out for his fifth start of the season.

05/02/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles Sweep Pirates in Marathon Doubleheader', 'Author\xe2\x80\x99s photoThe Baltimore Orioles defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates twice in a doubleheader on Thursday, while twice also enduring rain delays \xe2\x80\xa6 winning the first game 5-1 and taking the second 6-5 in 10 innings on a Matt Wieters walk-off homer at 1:00 a.m.A big part of the reason for my choice to drive to Camden Yards to personally experience this old-fashioned single-admission doubleheader was the Weather Channel\xe2\x80\x99s statement of 0% chance of precipitation. Three hours and thirty-two minutes of game one (featuring a rain delay) ended with an Orioles 5-1 victory. But before the second game could begin, down came the rain and out came the tarp for the second time. (My best decision of the week was getting a ticket in section 59 under the upper deck!)Truly some of the nastiest people I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met at Camden Yards have happened to be Pittsburgh fans. And on this day it started with the lady parking next to me. Surely divorced three or four times in her life, she immediately verbally jumped me (in my orange shirt) by complaining about the parking cost and rehearsing the horrors of baseball in Baltimore. Everything about the experience is terrible \xe2\x80\x93 the rude staff, the detestable food, and the disrespectful Baltimoreans who desecrate the National Anthem with their loud scream on the final stanza. Lady, get some medicine and go have a happy rest of your life!So it was great to be seated just in front of a group of two men and a boy who were clearly Baltimore Orioles fans. The young man had a variety of nice handmade signs, so I determined to use him for the cover photo today. After taking the picture above and asking his name and hometown, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that he was from my own community and plays in the same Conococheague Little League in Williamsport, MD as did my own boys. Kam Miller also had some fine Orioles drawings from art class. Truly his family is raising him well. Kam \xe2\x80\x93 listen to me dude, don\xe2\x80\x99t grow up and marry a Pirates fan!Game OneThe Orioles looked a bit like a team that had not played in four days, though fortunately the Pirates looked to be a squad that had not played in maybe 10 days. The Orioles pitching allowed a lot of base runners, while Pittsburgh failed over and over to take advantage of the situation, stranding a total of 13 and hitting only 1-for-14 with RISP.Sometimes I really hit it here on The Baltimore Wire with my viewpoints and opinions, though other times I have to sadly admit that I missed it completely. So, let me say that I repent in dust and ashes for all the less than positive things I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever written about Steve Pearce. The re-acquired Oriole (for what, the third time, fourth time?) went 3-for-4 while driving in two runs to supply a cushion giving Budd Norris his second victory of the year.Norris was not extra sharp, with his pitch count elevating significantly. But he got enough critical outs over 5.1 innings to strand runners and keep the Bucs off the board. Orioles relievers slogged through the remaining outs to likewise strand runners in scoring position.Nick Markakis really put a charge in a ball to right-center for his first homer of the year \xe2\x80\xa6 may it be the first of many.Game TwoAs Manny Machado took to the field to warm up, he was pictured on the big screen to cheers from the stadium and shouts of \xe2\x80\x9cManny, Manny!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And the entire stadium rose in a standing ovation upon his first time at the plate. Though he would be hitless in five appearances, his defense was again on display in this game, particularly in the top of the 10th inning.Anyone who reads this blog knows that I love baseball about as much as breathing, but, the 1st inning was about all that even I could endure! It took Chris Tillman a total of 49 pitches to get through it, eventually walking in two runs with the bases loaded. He was not extraordinarily sharp, but again as we\xe2\x80\x99ve so often seen, hitters foul off pitch after pitch. Added to that was an extremely small strike zone in game two, and, well, you end up with a game that goes on and on.Tillman would make it into the 5th inning, but like game one, most of the bullpen would be used before it was all over. After Evan Meek gave up a run in the top of the 6th inning which put the Pirates on top 4-0, the Orioles staged one of those character-displaying comebacks for which this squad is to be commended.In the bottom of the 6th, the Birds scored four runs to the tie the game \xe2\x80\x93 stringing together singles and doubles and plating all four runs with two outs. Adam Jones doubled home Markakis, Wieters singled home Jones, Pearce doubled to send Wieters to third, and J.J. Hardy singled home both runners.Though the Pirates would manage to take the lead again 5-4 with a single run in the top of the 7th inning, Markakis answered with his second homer of the evening, setting up a tied game into extra frames, ended dramatically and mercifully by Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 line-drive, 10th inning round-tripper just inside the pole.SummaryIt was a long, long day of baseball. The Pirates had runners on base all day, then all night, and then into the morning hours \xe2\x80\xa6 leaving 28 on base and going 6-for-30 with RISP. It was like watching your defense in football spend three quarters of the game on the field inside the red zone.But winning doubleheaders is rare, and the Baltimore Orioles will take it and push their record to 14-12. And while I write this in the wee hours of the morning, the team is sleeping on an airplane flying overhead to Minnesota to begin a weekend series with the Twins. That portends a difficult sort of sleep-walking game tomorrow, though some good news may be had in the fact that the Twins also had a doubleheader, with the second game going 12 innings \xe2\x80\x93 as they lost both ends to the Dodgers. Minnesota burned through 12.2 innings of relief pitching, even as the Orioles used a total of 9 innings of relievers.Additional Note: Throwing out the first pitch on Thursday was Terrence West \xe2\x80\x93 Towson University running back headed for the NFL draft next week.Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s first at bat of 2014 \xe2\x80\x93 author\xe2\x80\x99s photo ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles beat Pirates 6-5 for doubleheader sweep - USA TODAY', 'Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Bud Norris throws to the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first inning in the first baseball game of a doubleheader on Thursday, May 1, 2014, in Baltimore.

The rain lingered long enough to delay the fifth inning of the opener by 21 minutes, and the start of the nightcap was stalled 46 minutes by rain.The second game lasted 3 hours, 57 minutes. By the time it ended, the clock had ticked well past midnight.""It\'s not a late night, it\'s an early morning,"" said Orioles reliever Darren O\'Day, who pitched in both games.As O\'Day spoke, the team had 30 minutes to get ready for a trip to Minnesota for a three-game series that was to begin Friday night.""It will be a happy flight,"" O\'Day said, ""so that will make it a little easier.""The second game marked the season debut of Orioles third baseman Manny Machado, who had left knee surgery in October. After sitting out the opener, Machado received a warm ovation from the crowd of 28,290 before the second game and went 0 for 5.Baltimore trailed 4-0 in the nightcap before rallying with a four-run sixth. Adam Jones doubled in a run and scored on a single by Wieters before Pearce chased starter Brandon Cumpton with a double to right. Bryan Morris entered and yielded a two-run double to J.J. Hardy.Starling Marte countered with an RBI single in the seventh for Pittsburgh, but Markakis tied it in the bottom half with a solo shot off Morris.Wieters won it in the 10th with a drive to right off Pimentel (2-1) that soared just inside the foul pole.Tommy Hunter (1-0) got two outs for the win.Earlier, Baltimore ace Chris Tillman struggled through a 49-pitch first inning that could be attributed in part to a seven-day layoff. The right-hander issued three walks, two with the bases loaded, before getting three outs.Pittsburgh ended Tillman\'s outing in the fifth when Andrew McCutchen doubled and scored on a triple by Gaby Sanchez for a 3-0 lead.Pedro Alvarez had four hits for the Pirates, finishing a home run short of the cycle. But Pittsburgh stranded 15 and went 5 for 16 with runners in scoring position and lost for the 15th time in 19 games.""We keep fighting and fighting, and we put ourselves in scoring position and we haven\'t been able to cash in the way we need to,"" manager Clint Hurdle said. ""But we keep showing up. The bats were better throughout the series. ... We had men on base throughout the game, and still looking for that big hit.""The first game was all about Pearce, designated for assignment by Baltimore on April 22 and released five days later. After turning down an offer from Toronto, the first baseman was re-signed Monday after Chris Davis went on the 15-day disabled list.Pearce singled in the third, fifth and sixth innings of the opener and was solid in the field.""Stevie gave us a real lift,"" manager Buck Showalter said.Alvarez had two hits and an RBI for the Pirates, who stranded 13 and went 1 for 14 with runners in scoring position. The defeat ended Pittsburgh\'s nine-game road winning streak in interleague play.Trailing 1-0 when the rain stopped play, Baltimore regrouped during the break and sent nine batters to the plate in a three-run fifth. After a single, walk and an error loaded the bases against Charlie Morton (0-4), Pearce hit an RBI single and Ryan  Flaherty grounded an opposite-field, two-run single to left field.Pearce singled in a run in the sixth, and Markakis hit his first homer of the season in the seventh for a 5-1 lead.Orioles starter Bud Norris (2-2) allowed one run in 5 1-3 innings, and Hunter got the last out with runners on second and third for his seventh save.Morton started well but came unhinged after the rain delay and lost his fourth consecutive start. The right-hander permitted four runs, two earned, and seven hits in 5 1-3 innings.""I kept grooving fast balls to Steve Pearce and he kept putting good swings on them,"" Morton lamented.NOTES: Pittsburgh returns home to face Toronto on Friday night. ... Orioles LHP Troy Patton returned from a 25-game suspension before the second game.  Baltimore also activated Machado from the DL, and optioned INF Steve Lombardozzi and RHP Josh Stinson to Triple-A Norfolk. ... The last time Pittsburgh played a doubleheader on the road was in July 2011, at Washington. ... Pirates LHP Wandy Rodriguez (right knee inflammation) allowed three runs and four hits over 3 1-3 innings in a rehabilitation assignment for Double-A Altoona against Erie. ... Baltimore\'s rainout against Tampa Bay on April 15 was rescheduled as part of a split doubleheader on June 27.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

There was much speculation on whether Cruz would be able to manufacture those power numbers he was so accustomed to all his career after his name appeared on the Biogenesis report along with several other Major League ball players. The reason why I am talking about him is the fact that he may be quite possibly the best free agent pickup in all of baseball this year.Currently batting .297 with an on-base percentage of .377, Cruz has proven to be a reliable batter that Showalter knows can get on base when the Orioles need a base runner.

Just 24 hours ago, each team had a record of 12-12; and each played a doubleheader. However, the Orioles swept to two wins over the Pirates while the Twins dropped their twin bill to the Dodgers.But here is another similarity in the pitching matchup for this evening: Ubaldo Jimenez of the Orioles ($50 million, 4-year contract) will be going against Ricky Nolasco of the Twins ($49 million, 4-year contract).

05/03/2014,"[('Orioles look lifeless in 6-1 loss to Twins; league-worst ...', ' The Orioles came into Saturday\'s game riding a three-game winning streak, looking to win a fourth while going up against a pitcher who had been the worst starter by ERA in the entirety of baseball. You know the script here. Instead of feasting on the weak, the bats were somnolent, mustering only five hits in seven innings against Kevin Correia. Combined with a five-and-dive kind of effort from Wei-Yin Chen and some bad stuff from the bullpen, the Orioles instead looked pathetic as they fell to the Twins, 6-1. There\'s no good explanation for the phenomenon. I\'m sure the Orioles don\'t sit down ahead of time and decide they aren\'t going to try today. Sometimes they just look bad against a pitcher like Correia. Early in the game, it looked like they were trying to strike out on everything, with three in two innings. Correia had only struck out 12 in 27 innings heading into the game. They stopped striking out, which was something; instead, they started hitting everything to center fielder Sam Fuld, who was everywhere. Whatever the reason, it feels like sometimes they just rest on their laurels. ""Well, we just won three in a row, so one loss isn\'t a big deal."" And indeed, winning three out of four games is good. But later on there will be times where they\'re playing better teams and they won\'t win two out of three or three out of four; they\'ll split them, or lose them all, and wish they had beaten the soft part of their schedule. They failed today. They might fail again tomorrow. The Twins got on the scoreboard in the first inning, with Joe Mauer poking a single into left field against the shift. He kicked in the afterburners to score on a perfectly-placed double by Trevor Plouffe, just between Adam Jones and Nick Markakis. Jones cut the ball off before it could roll onto the warning track, but he had little chance to get Mauer as he raced to the plate.    Chen ended up pitching five innings plus one batter, allowing six hits, one walk, and three runs (two earned) while striking out five. He was let down on a couple of occasions by his defense, with both J.J. Hardy and Manny Machado committing throwing errors, and Steve Pearce looking like a guy who\'s the backup first baseman. There were some bad throws, but there were some balls he should have caught. The unearned run scored on a single to shallow left where an outfielder with a good arm would have had the runner at the plate. David Lough was playing left field today, so, you know.    When you end up with the starter throwing 108 pitches and getting no outs in the sixth inning, you know that it wasn\'t a great day. He was behind everyone, one more of those times where you have to wonder if anyone on the Orioles has ever consulted a scouting report. The Twins have been a patient team so far this year, so maybe throw strikes. Well, he might have been trying to throw strikes and just missing. In any case, it wasn\'t a terrible start for Chen, but he didn\'t deserve any better than his results, either. These things would have been frustrating if it was a close game, but it wasn\'t, because the Orioles hitters slept through the game, and also because Brad Brach did not have a successful Oriole debut. He relieved Chen with a man on first in the sixth and retired the side.    However, he had something of a Jake Arrieta Memorial Inning for the seventh. Brach allowed a couple of cheap bloopers, including one to former Oriole Pedro Florimon, who was later picked off first base, only the umpire called him safe and manager Buck Showalter did not ask for a review despite what looked to me like a conclusive angle showing that Pearce tagged out Florimon. He would go on to steal second base on another play where he was possibly out. Mauer followed up the pair of bloops with a three-run blast, his second home run of the year, giving the Twins a 6-1 lead. At that point, it was just piling on. The Orioles never had a chance today. That is the true frustrating thing. They should have been looking to keep up in first place in the division and they slumbered. With a Yankees win, the O\'s are back down into second place, only a half-game behind, but still. First place is way more fun, and if they hang around in the pennant chase for a while, this is one of those games they\'ll wish they had back. The O\'s lone run came in the second inning, and even that was something of a fluke. Jones reached base on a dropped third strike. The pitch was so far out in front of the plate that it bounced and went through Twins catcher Kurt Suzuki\'s legs, kicking off of his foot and back towards the visitors dugout. Jones still swung at it because he\'s Adam Jones. He raced to first, so at least we can give him that.    Jones then stole second, putting him in scoring position when, one batter later, Hardy singled to center. The play at the plate was close, but Jones scored the O\'s lone run. The score was then 1-1. Things escalated later. Maybe they will suck less tomorrow. As he came on to explain the loss at the outset of the MASN post-game show, even the usually-sunny Rick Dempsey could find little good to say about the game. ""They were flat,"" he said, and that\'s exactly what they were. The O\'s will be back on Sunday afternoon to try to take the rubber game of the three-game set. Miguel Gonzalez starts for the Orioles, with certified home run manufacturer Phil Hughes starting for the Twins. So help me, the Orioles had better not look awful against him.

Mandatory Credit: Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY SportsJonathan Schoop leads the Baltimore Orioles in errors, holds a .227 batting average, and is hitless in five of his last seven games. After a very promising spring, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 top position playing prospect\xe2\x80\x99s transition into regular major league playing time has not been as smooth as fans would have hoped.In the field, Schoop was thrust into playing third base in hopes of filling the void left by Manny Machado early in the season. While Schoop was able to show some power at the plate early on, his defense at the position was suspect. He committed four of his team-leading five errors at third base.After showing that he was better suited for his natural position of second base, Schoop began to struggle offensively. He\xe2\x80\x99s received a steady diet of off-speed pitches, and has responded with 27 strikeouts over his 88 at-bats, which is second-highest on the team behind Adam Jones.Now, Schoop has to wonder if manager Buck Showalter will have more patience with him than the prospect has shown at the plate.All can agree that regular at bats and playing time are the best thing for Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s development. If Schoop continues to hamper the major league team by giving away unproductive outs, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible he sees those at-bats at AAA Norfolk.Meanwhile, fellow second baseman Jemile Weeks has shown a more polished approach than Schoop and brings the added ability to switch-hit and to steal bases. Weeks is batting .273 since his call-up in late April.Another potential Orioles second baseman, Steve Lombardozzi, hit .292 during his time with the big league club and went 2-for-2 with three walks yesterday in his first game at AAA.Before Machado\xe2\x80\x99s return, Schoop was needed at the major league level to provide the Orioles another option at third base. Now that Machado is the everyday third baseman and utility man Ryan Flaherty has returned to the bench as his backup, Schoop is no longer an essential piece of the major league club \xe2\x80\x94 just one of at least three second baseman who could see time the bigs.In Weeks and Lombardozzi, the Orioles have two options that have outperformed Schoop so far this season. Schoop may be the best option for the team\xe2\x80\x99s long term plans, but every move the Orioles have made in the offseason and throughout the early part of the regular season indicates that they are in a \xe2\x80\x9cwin now\xe2\x80\x9d mode.Giving Weeks and Lombardozzi an extended look doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean giving up on Schoop in the future, but it does mean exploring all of the options to make the 2014 team better.

Perhaps the most noteworthy part of this game was that it featured errors by two gold glovers in Manny Machado and J.J. Hardy (hence the one unearned run). Errors are going to happen from time to time, however Buck Showalter and company are smart enough to know that with this group it\xe2\x80\x99s the exception instead of the rule.Joe Mauer got aboard with a one-out single in the last of the first, and he was doubled homeCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsby Trevor Plouffe to give Minnesota a 1-0 lead on the O\xe2\x80\x99s. However one thing that the Baltimore Orioles did prove yesterday is that good things happen when you hustle and pay close attention to detail. Adam Jones struck out to lead off the top of the second, however the breaking ball got far away from catcher Kurt Suzuki. That gave Jones a chance to reach first base, and sure enough he beat Suzuki\xe2\x80\x99s throw. Jones then proceeded to \xe2\x80\x9csteal\xe2\x80\x9d second base, although my personal opinion is that Oriole catcher Steve Clevenger might have missed a hit-and-run sign and neglected to swing. Jones would score on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single to tie the game at one.Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s Brian Dozier would send a solo homer over the fence to lead off the third, and in the last of the fifth he would reach on an infield single. However he would take second base on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s aforementioned throwing error, and he would later score on Mauer\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single to give Minnesota a 3-1 lead. Mauer would come up again in the last of the seventh with two runners on, and he would send a three-run homer into the seats to run Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s lead to 6-1.That home run was off of Brad Brach, who was recalled by the O\xe2\x80\x99s on Friday when they optioned Evan Meek to triple-A Norfolk. Other than the homer, Brach was fairly solid over 1.1 innings, striking out two. Brach is a pitcher that was drafted in 2008 by the Padres organization, and pitched three years at the big league level there before coming to the Orioles this past off season. He of course was assigned to triple-A Norfolk out of spring training. The Orioles also called Troy Patton out of the bullpen for his second appearance since returning from suspension, and he pitched 1.2 innings of scoreless baseball.The O\xe2\x80\x99s find themselves in a situation going into this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s series finale in which their bullpen is fairly rested. However the fact is that Buck Showalter can be a bit more liberal with using relievers if need be today because the O\xe2\x80\x99s will have an off day in Tampa tomorrow before opening up a series with the Tampa Rays on Tuesday night. In fact, Showalter is expected to take a short trip to Ed Smith Stadium in Sarasota (approximately an hour or so from Tampa) tomorrow to watch Johan Santana\xe2\x80\x98s bullpen session \xe2\x80\x93 which might come in the form of a simulated game. But first thing\xe2\x80\x99s first; Miguel Gonzalez will start the series finale in Minnesota for the Orioles this afternoon, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Phil Hughes. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles bats mostly flat again in 5-2 loss to Twins ...', "" There are days where baseball can be a reminder of all the wondrous possibilities in life. There are other days where baseball leads you to realize that all joy is temporary, that the universe is a plane of suffering and torment, indifferent to our presence. The Orioles played the latter sort of game on Sunday, capping a series against the Twins with a 5-2 loss even though the Twins starter was Phil Hughes. In the three games of the series, started by Ricky Nolasco, Kevin Correia, and Hughes, the Orioles managed to score a combined six runs. This will not get you very far, except headed towards last place. That the Orioles ended up winning one of the games is nice, and also meaningless, because they are subject to domination by the dregs of the American League at any time. How can there be any hope that they will succeed against legitimately good pitchers and teams? You can write it off as an extended hangover from the marathon doubleheader on Thursday if you like. If that's what it is, then Monday's off-day is sorely needed for the team. But that doubt creeps up into the picture, that maybe they just aren't that good, they've gotten lucky to even have done what they have done so far, and pitchers, even bad ones, can go in with a plan and shut them down. At one point, Hughes retired fourteen batters in a row. That is a sentence that should never be written unless he's rehabbing in A-ball, and maybe not even then. They only mustered six hits and two runs against him. This on a day where the Yankees were beaten by the Rays. The chance was there to move back in to the division lead. The O's took the field but did little else to advance their cause.    With the Orioles hitters looking the way they did, Miguel Gonzalez would have needed to be perfect to have a chance of winning. He was not perfect. No one is perfect in life. In baseball, this is even more true. A given game is about who fails the least. He was fine enough through four innings and fell apart in the fifth. That is not a good day. He walked four while giving up six hits and three runs in 4.2 innings, with seven strikeouts. Gonzalez threw 94 pitches.    Before the game, a stat made the rounds that showed the average pitches per inning for Orioles starters. The lowest was Bud Norris at 16.9 pitches per inning. No starter is able to get through six innings with fewer than 100 pitches with their current averages. Even when they get decent results - which they don't always, and didn't today - this is the kind of thing that will pile up into a problem for the team. Nelson Cruz launched a baseball 106 miles per hour into the facade of the third deck at Target Field in the top of the sixth inning. That came after Manny Machado reached on an infield single. This was the extent of Orioles scoring on the day. Cruz has been a pleasant revelation so far. The home run was his ninth of the season. His two homers in the series accounted for three of the six runs the Orioles scored.    They managed to chase Hughes in the seventh inning with back-to-back one-out singles by J.J. Hardy and Delmon Young. The Twins brought in reliever Anthony Swarzak, who was sporting a 5.28 ERA headed into today. Steve Pearce hacked at a garbage first pitch and popped out foul. Good job, Team Steve. Go away. Swarzak then walked Jonathan Schoop, who earned the walk by spitting on a 3-2 pitch that may have actually been a strike. That loaded the bases and bounced Swarzak from the game in favor of lefty Caleb Thielbar with Nick Markakis due up. If you think this has a happy ending, you weren't paying attention. Markakis hit a sharp grounder right back at the pitcher. Thielbar made a nice play to stab it, if we feel like being fair. In another world, that may have been a single up the middle, scoring two runs. Alas, we live on this world. The two-homer day on Thursday may as well have been a dream.    The brief sensation of hope was snuffed in the bottom of the seventh inning when Ryan Webb ran into some unfortunate circumstances. Chris Colabello hit a double in the direction of a lead-footed Markakis. He trotted to third when third base umpire Jeff Nelson called a balk on Webb that was not a balk. With one out and a 2-1 count on Jason Kubel, manager Buck Showalter opted to intentionally walk Kubel to set up a potential ground-ball double play. Instead, Kurt Suzuki lashed a double off the left field wall, just out of the reach of Nelson Cruz. This is the kind of play where David Lough would have probably made it. If only the Orioles weren't bound and determined to keep Young as the designated hitter, that scenario may have played out more favorably. Actually, with a 2-for-4 day, Young is now batting .320/.358/.440 on the year, so at least he's not a complete waste of space. The Orioles continually cross their fingers that they can live with the consequences in the field. It burned them today. Suzuki drove in two runs, giving the Twins a 5-2 lead. It probably doesn't matter anyway because it's not like the Orioles were ever going to score again. Sure enough, they did not, although just to tease us, they got a couple men on with two outs in the ninth. Pearce hit a lazy pop fly that should have been the game-ender, but right fielder Chris Herrmann dropped the ball. Schoop smoked a single down the right field line to bring the tying run to the plate, which was once again Markakis. He struck out on three pitches. He swung at a high pitch and then stared at two strikes. The Orioles head into a Monday off day with a 15-14 record, sitting half a game back in second place in the American League East division. They next head to face the Tampa Bay Rays. Chris Tillman will face off against Chris Archer in the opening game of the series on Tuesday.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

He flat out dominated over 5 of his 6 innings of work.

He threw 85 pitches, 57 for strikes.    I was able to watch this game via MiLB.tv. Harvey cruised through the first 4 innings, working his fastball around the zone and snapping off a number of beautiful curveballs. He entered the 5th inning around 50 pitches before exiting around 75. A HBP opened the inning, followed by a SB and Harvey\'s only BB of the night. The next batter laid down a very good sac bunt towards 3B. Harvey cut off the charging 3Bman (probably unnecessarily) and grabbed the ball, but dropped it on the transfer from his glove to hand. Bases now loaded, Harvey shows some serious fortitude and goes right after the next hitter, striking him out on 3 pitches. He induces the next batter to hit an easy grounder to 3B. But (3B) Drew Dosch, unable to turn a possible inning ending double play, goes to Home with the ball. The runner would have been out, but the throw was spiked and the catcher could not handle it. 1 run in, bases still loaded. No matter to Hunter. He goes and Ks the next hitter on a flat out nasty curve ball. But, yet again, luck betrayed him as the Catcher (once again) could not handle the bounce. The ball skipped away and the runner from 3rd came in to score the 2nd run of the inning. The next hitter, fellow 1st Round selection and hulking human Aaron Judge would loop a weak single the opposite way into RF to score 2 more, but would be thrown out at 2nd thinking the throw would come into the plate. Despite the long inning he, somewhat surprisingly, came back out for the 6th and rewarded his Manger\'s faith in him by setting down the side in order.

He\'s here, with us, seeming more than a bit sad about the whole affair, and yet he\'s not entirely here in the way that most of us will always remember -- he\'s nodding off, and he can\'t seem to keep up with the flurry of activity from nine children and grandchildren trying to get him moved.    It\'s hard to say what\'s worse: Going through this horrible activity that makes me think of my grandfather being gone, or seeing him still here to witness it.    * * * * * * * * * * * Later that night, the family takes my grandfather out to celebrate his 89th birthday. \xc2\xa0The guest of honor still can\'t keep up with the conversation, which at one point drifts to baseball. \xc2\xa0My aunt asks us cousins if we remember the year that grandpa took us to Camden Yards. I hadn\'t thought about that visit in years. Every summer, the cousins would spend a week at our grandparents\' house in southern Maryland, in groups of like age or gender. \xc2\xa0We\'d crab-fish from their pier, eat junk food, and wreak havoc on their lovely retirement home.    One year, Grandpa took four baseball-loving preteen boys for a tour of Camden Yards. \xc2\xa0At 11ish years old, I didn\'t really know that the newly-opened Camden Yards would kick off a noveau-retro design flurry, or swing ballparks back from outlying islands surrounded by oceans of asphalt, back to being integrated downtown attractions. \xc2\xa0What I knew at the time was that the Orioles played there, and that it was awesome for my grandpa to get me access to the dugout, warning track and warehouse on a warm summer day. I knew that Cal Ripken, Brady Anderson, Harold Baines, Chris Hoiles, Mike Devereaux and David Segui sat on that dugout bench, played on that grass (the one place they wouldn\'t let me step) and stood right in that on-deck circle. And maybe to my grandfather it was just a fun afternoon with his grandsons at a notable new Maryland attraction, but to a kid for whom baseball was still magic, it was a lot more. * * * * * * * * * * * I hadn\'t thought about that day in years. \xc2\xa0I had thought about the one and only game I remember seeing at Memorial Stadium, about cheering on the Orioles stars of my childhood, and about several trips up to Camden Yards as a teenager, but I hadn\'t thought about that tour in a long, long time.    And isn\'t that just baseball fandom for you? \xc2\xa0Your identity as a baseball fan can be intertwined with your familial identity in so many ways that you don\'t even routinely remember them all. The kids growing up in Virginia and DC today are forming these kinds of bonds and memories at Nationals Park, and I don\'t begrudge them that. \xc2\xa0If baseball keeps connecting families that way, it doesn\'t really matter where it happens, even if it\'s in a park with ugly attached parking garages and absurd racing Presidents as ""the main event."" \xc2\xa0But for me, real baseball will always involve the crab shuffle, orange uniforms and the Inner Harbor, even if there\'s nothing else remotely Maryland about me. \xc2\xa0I don\'t mind that discrepancy a bit. So no, I\'m not a Nationals fan. \xc2\xa0Maybe I put more meaning into my childhood memories of the Orioles than I should. \xc2\xa0But it seems like something that I can\'t just change about myself with a modicum of sincerity. \xc2\xa0I can\'t just toss or replace my Orioles fandom, like I was forced to choose the fate of so many of my grandfather\'s possessions. \xc2\xa0Loyalty and passion are free, and they don\'t take up any space. \xc2\xa0I can keep them around, even if I can\'t keep Grandpa around forever. \xc2\xa0I can deal with annoying, traffic-laden drives up I-95 ten times a year, in exchange for a feeling of connectedness that goes all the way back to my childhood and spans generations.

05/08/2014,"[('Orioles to wear Negro League throwback uniforms on \\u2026', "" As participants in\xc2\xa0Major League Baseball's 8th annual Civil Rights Game, the Baltimore Orioles and Houston Astros will honor the Negro League with throwback uniforms on May 30th. The Orioles will don the look of the Baltimore Elite Giants, while the Astros will wear those of the Newark Eagles. Neither the Orioles or Astros have roots in the Negro Leagues, but the teams will honor a franchise that shared their city in the 1940s and 1950s. The Elite Giants were established as the Nashville (Tennessee) Standard Giants in 1920. When the team moved to Baltimore in 1933, the franchise was rebranded as the Elite Giants, as it would stay until the franchise dissolved in 1950. The Elite Giants won the Negro National Championship in 1936, defeating the Homestead Grays in a five-game series. A number of notable players wore an Elite Giants uniform, including Hall of Famer Roy Campanella, 1952 National League Rookie of the Year Joe Black, and 1953 National Rookie of the Year Junior Gilliam, all of the Brooklyn Dodgers.    The Newark Eagles were formed during a merger in 1936 between two independent league teams, the Newark Dodgers and the Brooklyn Eagles. Combining players from both franchises, the Eagles won the 1946 Negro League World Series, defeating the heavily-favored Kansas City Monarchs in seven games. The franchise moved to Houston in 1949, playing two seasons in the Magnolia City before moving to New Orleans. Shortly thereafter, the Eagles dissolved due to low attendance figures. A number of future Hall of Famers played for the Eagles, including Larry Doby, Leon Day, Monte Irvin, Biz Mackey, and Willie Wells. ESPN Sports Business Reporter\xc2\xa0Darren Rovell tweeted a picture of the uniforms that the teams will wear later this month. As the road team, the Orioles will wear a red and blue reproduction of the Elite Giants' uniforms, which is very similar to the Atlanta Braves' current road look. The Astros' throwback uniforms will feature a simple blue and white scheme. Both teams will wear a Civil Rights Game patch on the right sleeve and left side of the caps.  Last season, the Atlanta Braves (Atlanta Black Crackers), Washington Nationals (Homestead Grays), Detroit Tigers (Detroit Stars), Cincinnati Reds (Cincinnati Tigers), Pittsburgh Pirates (Homestead Grays), Milwaukee Brewers (Milwaukee Bears), Kansas City Royals (Kansas City Monarchs), and the Miami Marlins (Triple-A Miami Marlins) paid tribute with throwback reproductions.    In addition, an Orioles' spokesman confirmed my earlier report that\xc2\xa0the Orioles will wear throwback uniforms on August 24th\xc2\xa0against the Cubs.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""Jonathan Schoop's homer lifts the Baltimore Orioles"", 'One of the big underlying points of last night\xe2\x80\x99s game was that catcher Caleb Joseph made his much-deferred major league debut. Joseph was drafted in 2008, and finally made it up to the big leagues after over six years. After finding out that Matt Wieters wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to the DL, the Baltimore Orioles optioned Jermile Weeks to triple-A Norfolk and officially called up Joseph.Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s first task as a big league catcher was calling the game for starter Bud Norris, and while Norris\xe2\x80\x99 pitch count got up there, for all intents and purposes Joseph called a good game. Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 5.2 IP, 3 H, 2 R, 4 BB, 5 K. A lot of people continue to point to starters\xe2\x80\x99 pitch counts, and perhaps with good reason. However keep in mind that Oriole pitchers have a lot of pitches fouled off on a regular basis. People should be worried if guys are missing their spots; for the most part, that\xe2\x80\x99s not occurring here.The Orioles jumped out to a 1-0 lead when Adam Jones hit the first pitch he saw in the second inning off the ballpark facade in center field. When Jones\xe2\x80\x99 turn in the lineup came around again, he literally did the same thing \xe2\x80\x93 meaning that he hit the ball to the same spot in the park. However Norris struggled a bit in the last of the fifth, allowing David DeJesus to homer on the first pitch of the inning. But to his credit (and to that of Caleb Joseph), Norris pitched out of it.However Sean Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single in the last of the sixth tied the game at two, granting Norris a no-decision on the night. But the O\xe2\x80\x99s were done quite yet either. Steve Pearce got aboard in the top of the seventh with a single up the middle, and Jonathan Schoop followedCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sportsthat up with the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 third homer of the night. Suddenly the Orioles led again, and by two at that.Tommy Hunter gave up an RBI-single in the last of the ninth and had the winning run on first, however he got out of it to record the win. So the Birds find themselves in a situation going into what\xe2\x80\x99s normally a \xe2\x80\x9crubber match\xe2\x80\x9d on the final day or a series whereby they\xe2\x80\x99ve already won the series.Caleb Joseph had a great game behind the plate in his big league debut. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to record his first major league hit, however behind the dish he was invaluable to Oriole pitching. I obviously don\xe2\x80\x99t know, however I suspect that Joseph will be with the Orioles until Chris Davis is ready to return to the club. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear when Matt Wieters will be able to resume the catching duties for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, however the fact is that\xe2\x80\x99s why Joseph is here.As I alluded above, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will have a shot at a sweep tomorrow night in Tampa. Ubaldo Jimenez will take to the mound for the Birds, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s David Price. After a disappointing weekend in Minnesota, a sweep of their division rivals would be a huge pickup for the Orioles. One more thing about Caleb Joseph; kudos to him for hanging in there in the minors for as long as he did. His call up to the big leagues was more than well deserved and earned. A lot of people, myself included, would have given up and/or looked at conventional wisdom telling them that they\xe2\x80\x99d never make it to the big leagues. But his patience and perseverance paid off. I hope for his sake his first game was a pleasurable experience all-around; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the entire day is a moment he\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget.

Absalon-USA TODAY Sports\xc2\xa0Coming into Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s game the Orioles sit three games above .500 and are tied with the Yankees for first place in the AL East. Despite the lack of quality starts and a few injuries to key position players, the Orioles have played themselves to the third best record in the American League. It\xe2\x80\x99s a position few baseball insiders predicted in spring training. One advantage the Orioles have seen this season is the health of their pitching staff. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear the rotation has not been stellar so far, but not a single starter has missed a start. However, over the course of the 131 remaining games this trend is unlikely to continue. When needed, who will be the next person up?The obvious choice would be Kevin Gausman. He struggled at times in the Orioles rotation last season, but eventually became a valuable arm out of the bullpen. Although he started the year in AAA Norfolk, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the Orioles see him being a factor with the major-league squad sometime this season. Gausman has been on a pitch count of around 75, an obvious attempt to keep him fresh for the late season. However, recently Gausman has be shelved due to pneumonia. It\xe2\x80\x99s not something that should force him to miss significant time, but if the Orioles needed an arm in the next couple weeks they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call him up.Dylan Bundy and Johan Santana are seemly on similar paths back to the majors after missing last season with arm surgeries. Santana looks to be close to a rehab assignment, which could make him available by the end of the month. However, with his loss in velocity he may struggle to find consistent success in the AL East. At this point in his career he may be more suited for a long-man/sixth starter spot in the bullpen, which still could be valuable in August and September.Orioles fans are going to be watching Dylan Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s rehab news closely all summer. It may be a slow process as Orioles are going be extremely cautious with their prize arm. Despite the fact that Bundy blew through the minors in 2012 and made an impressive debut in September with the Orioles, he pitched only 105 innings that season before missing last season with Tommy John. When he begins making rehab starts he\xe2\x80\x99ll be on a strict pitch count. Orioles fans expecting him to be a major factor this season may be disappointed. However, he could provide a spark late in the season.The Orioles have several other intriguing arms waiting in AAA. Steve Johnson showed he could have success at the major league level in 2012, but he\xe2\x80\x99s been hampered by injuries the last two seasons and is currently struggling with a shoulder injury. The converted knuckle-baller Eddie Gamboa has had some early success this season with 39 strikeouts to only 9 walks through his first 41 innings. If he can find more consistent success with his knuckle-ball he could be an intriguing arm to watch for later in the season. The biggest disappointment this season may be Suk-min Yoon who has pitched to an Era over 7 through his first six starts, and may be headed for the bullpen where he pitched last season in Korea.Pitching depth is key to any team looking to contend in September, and Dan Duquette has done a good job accumulating quality arms at the lower levels. As the season progresses, it will be interesting to see which arm immerges as the next arm up for the Orioles.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

In fact, Price pitched a good game against the timely Oriole bats. However Ubaldo Jimenez pitched just a hair better, as the O\xe2\x80\x99s outlasted Tampa 3-1 for a sweep at Tropicana Field.For the second straight game, Jimenez turned in a solid effort. In his last two starts (including last night), he\xe2\x80\x99s come across as a guy who\xe2\x80\x99s starting to bring it together. However he still was only able to pitch into the sixth inning of the game, due to a high pitch count. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.1 IP, 7 H, 1 R, 2 BB, 3 K. The issue with Jimenez and all of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters is not \xe2\x80\x9cstuff,\xe2\x80\x9d location, command, or anything else. The issue is that the ebb and flow of the games are warranting them to throw a lot of pitches \xe2\x80\x93 whether this is people fouling balls off, or anything else. This is something that needs to change, lest the Birds want to risk someone\xe2\x80\x99s arm falling off down in the \xe2\x80\x98pen.Tampa struck first blood in this one with an RBI-single by Evan Longoria in the last of the first. However the good news is that the Birds didn\xe2\x80\x99t trail for long. J.J. Hardy hit a two-out double,Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sportsand he was then plated by Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x98s two-run homer \xe2\x80\x93 which gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 2-1 lead. That was Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s second homer of the series; there can be no doubt that Pearce has played a huge role for this team offensively since his return, which is pretty much how Buck Showalter envisioned things going.The O\xe2\x80\x99s extended their lead to 3-1 in the fourth when Jonathan Schoop\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single scored Adam Jones. However both teams loaded the bases \xe2\x80\x93 the O\xe2\x80\x99s with nobody out, and Tampa with one gone \xe2\x80\x93 later in the game, and in both situations the pitcher was able to pitch out of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s often tough to win when you can\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of your rival\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes. However if you can do it even one more time than the other guy, your odds at winning go up leaps and bonds.With Tommy Hunter having worked on consecutive nights, Buck Showalter summoned Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day to close the game. O\xe2\x80\x99Day came in to protect the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 3-1 lead, and allowed two base runners to reach base. However a timely double-play and a ground out in the infield secured the game, as the O\xe2\x80\x99s defeated Tampa 3-1. While the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen bent a bit, it certainly never broke.So the O\xe2\x80\x99s now head home in the wake of their three-game sweep of their division rivals. Waiting for them there will be the Texas Rangers, who will come into Camden Yards for three games over the weekend. Wei-Yin Chen will take the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by former Oriole Scott Feldman. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say that Oriole bats are returning to the yard warm, however at least in the Tampa series they were very timely. And now they\xe2\x80\x99ll have the option of heating up, as the weather in their home park will finally be suitable for the ball to fly at the yard this weekend. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Is A Closer a Must for the Orioles? - birdswatcher.com', 'Mandatory Credit: Brad Rempel-USA TODAY SportsWith Jim Johnson being traded away to the Athletics in the off season, the Orioles needed to figure out who their closer was going to be for the upcoming season. They thought they found their man in Grant Balfour, but after failing his physical, the Orioles decided not to sign him. Over the duration of Spring Training, Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette made the decision to make Tommy Hunter\xc2\xa0their closer.Hunter has a solid fastball that reaches the upper 90\xe2\x80\x99s in pitch speed. Unfortunately, he does not have too much command over his other pitches, especially his breaking ball, and he leaves the ball hanging over the center of the plate on many occasions. This leads to the opposing team getting on base with more rapidity than Showalter would like. Actually, Hunter has yet to record a \xe2\x80\x9c1,2,3 inning\xe2\x80\x9d this season.Despite all of this, Hunter is currently tied for the highest amount of saves in the American League at ten total. Whether it is a crucial strikeout with the bases loaded or an acrobatic catch like the one Hunter made to end the game Wednesday night to beat the Rays, Hunter has gotten the job done all but once this season when Showalter called on him to end the game.However, I think I speak for everyone when I say every O\xe2\x80\x99s fan starts to sweat and their hearts beat a tad faster\xc2\xa0when Hunter is on the mound\xe2\x80\x94just like when Johnson was on the mound for Baltimore last season.The question is though: Do the Orioles really need a set closer?Buck Showalter would probably admit that the position of closer is not natural to Hunter. If that is the case, then why not have the relievers just go another inning. Relievers like Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Zach Britton are only getting to pitch one inning at the most each time they get put into the game. Why not just leave them in to record three more outs if they are feeling confident in their ability.Taking Wednesday night\xe2\x80\x99s game for example again; Britton was in full command of all his pitches. He was getting the batters he faced to chase pitches low in the strike zone causing weak ground balls to be hit to the shortstop and back to him.As a former starter, I am sure Britton could pitch two effective innings any given night. No where in the rule book of baseball does it say you have to have a closer. This statement became evident on Thursday night as Showalter put in O\xe2\x80\x99Day to get the save and secure the sweep over the Rays.If you have relievers like O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Britton who hold 0.69 and 0.89 ERA\xe2\x80\x99s, respectively, then is there really any need to put in Hunter just to give up a comfortable two run lead in the ninth and cause all Orioles fans to rip their hair out? I think not. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Comparing the A.L. East offenses - Camden Chat', ' We\'re just over a month into the season, and the five teams of the American League East are tightly packed in the standings. There are less games between first and last place in the A.L. East than between first and second place in the A.L. Central. Going into this year it was thought by many that the one of the strengths of the Orioles would be its offense, with the pitching staff being much more suspect. So after 30+ games for all of the teams, how does the Orioles offense stack up to the rest of the division? (Note: All numbers are through May 7th and do not include the games played last night) First things first, let\'s look at results. Namely, runs scored. Runs scored don\'t necessarily speak to the talent level of a team, but ultimately they\'re the most important thing. Since not all teams have played the same number of games, I\'ll also show runs/game.    Runs/Game Total Runs   Blue Jays 4.88 166   Orioles 4.32 134   Yankees 4.27 141   Rays 4.24 144   Red Sox 4.15 141   The Orioles have played a few less games than the other teams in the East, so their total number looks a little paltry, but with runs/game they are second to only the Jays. Really the Jays are the only team that stands out from the pack, scoring 1/2 run per game more than the Orioles. Not surprisingly, the Blue Jays also top the division in offensive WAR, at 6.2. The Rays (5.4) are behind them, followed by the Yankees (4.9) and Red Sox (3.5). The Orioles and their free-swinging ways come in last at a paltry 2.8.    Speaking of free swinging, how about plate discipline? As you all know, the Orioles aren\'t really known for getting on base. They rank last in the AL East with their team mark of .314. Tops is the Red Sox at .340, followed by Tampa Bay (.332), Toronto (.329), and New York (.325). The O\'s are also the only team in the A.L. East whose mark comes in below the average for the entire American League, .323. Here are some additional plate-discipline numbers that will make you sad for the Orioles.         Pitches/PA O-Swing% Z-Swing% O-Contact% Z-Contact%   Orioles 3.67 33.50% 67.20% 65.40% 87.10%   Yankees 3.94 27.70% 66.30% 69.90% 89.40%   Red Sox 4.07 25.90% 61.80% 66.60% 85.40%   Blue Jays 3.86 27.50% 62.10% 63.70% 87.80%   Rays 3.88 24.20% 62.90% 64.70% 89.10%   (This table is sortable, so click a column header if you like)    Pitches per plate appearances is self explanatory, but let me explain the other stats, taken from\xc2\xa0FanGraphs, in case you\'re not familiar. O-Swing% is the percentage of pitches swing out outside the strike zone, Z-Swing% is the percentage of pitches swung at inside the zone. O and Z contact % are the % of contact made outside and inside the zone, respectively. So for pitches outside the strike zone, the Orioles swing 33.5% of the time, almost 8% more than the next closest team. It\'s only about 30 games of data, but that is not impressive. We\'ve all seen it, and it isn\'t very fun to watch. And while they swing at the most pitches outside the zone, they certainly aren\'t making contact on the most. In case you\'re curious, the Oriole who swings the most outside the zone is young Jonathan Schoop, at 40.5%. And he only makes contact 50% of the time, which is pretty bad. The Red Sox are the best team in the East when it comes to plate discipline, but power is where the Orioles excel, right? Maybe not, with Chris Davis on the DL and J.J. Hardy and Adam Jones having power outages. To the numbers!         HR 2B SLG% ISO   Orioles 26 55 .397 .134   Yankees 30 66 .406 .142   Red Sox 27 70 .383 .136   Blue Jays 44 61 .432 .175   Rays 30 67 .391 .139   Again, keep in mind that the Orioles have played 2-3 less games than the other teams, though their overall numbers aren\'t really that impressive anyway. Their .397 SLG is third best in the East but is still under .400 so that disappoints me. And really, the four non-Canadian teams are pretty closely lumped together in both SLG% and ISO. If you\'re not familiar with\xc2\xa0ISO, it\'s a stat that measures how good a player (or in this case, team) is at hitting for extra bases. The MLB average so far this season for ISO is .140, meaning that the non-Blue Jays teams are hovering around average. As we all know, it\'s still early, but it stands to reason that the Orioles will improve in this area. With Davis hopefully close to returning, Jones looking over the last few games like he has a clue at the plate, and the fact that Hardy has to start hitting a few home runs eventually (doesn\'t he?). Currently the only guys doing much power-wise are Matt Wieters and Nelson Cruz. There is one more stat I care to look at, and that\'s\xc2\xa0wOBA. wOBA is a catch-all stat whose job it is to measure overall offensive value by a player.    wOBA   Blue Jays 0.337   Rays 0.322   Orioles 0.314   Yankees 0.309   Red Sox 0.302      The MLB average for wOBA so far this year is .314, so hooray, the Orioles are average! \xc2\xa0These numbers will of course change as the season goes on and I presume so will the rankings. For now it seems that, while the Orioles have been a little disappointing offensively, they are certainly holding their own in the division. Ultimately, the only thing that matters is the number of wins the team gets, and it\'s easier to win when you score more runs. In that sense, the Orioles have been successful relative to the rest of the A.L. East so far this year. Despite several easy to recall failures over this past series, their OPS with runners in scoring position is better than both the Yankees and Red Sox, and when you look at clutch stats, the Orioles as a team hit better when the game is tied or when it is ""late and close"" (7th inning or later with the batting team tied, ahead by one, or the tying run on deck) than every A.L. East team other than the Blue Jays. When there is only one run difference in the score, they still come in better than the Red Sox or Rays. If the Orioles want to spend the entire year scoring more runs per game than the Red Sox, Rays, and Yankees, then I don\'t care how they do it. All it\'s gotten them so far is first place. If they want to hit better when the game is close (although let\'s face it, most of the O\'s games are close), and that leads to more runs, I\'m all for it. But I think it\'s fair to say that those things will continue to come easier throughout the year if they can, as a team, improve both their on-base and power numbers. Because right now, those numbers aren\'t looking too hot. All stats taken from\xc2\xa0FanGraphs or\xc2\xa0Baseball Reference.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
05/10/2014,"[('Orioles minor league rundown - 5/9 - Camden Chat', "" Norfolk Tides 10, Indianapolis Indians 7 The Tides had 23 hits last night. That is a lot of hits. Every single Tide who stepped to the plate last night had at least two hits, and five of them had three! DH Xavier Paul and 3B Buck Britton each homered, with Britton falling just a double short of the cycle. LF Steve Lombardozzi, SS Ivan DeJesus, and 2B Alexi Casilla all doubled, and CF Quintin Berry had two doubles. Basically, if you can think of a player on the Tides team, he probably was on base multiple times last night. As for the pitching, Suk-Min Yoon finally got a win and had a decent night. He lasted five innings and gave up three runs. He struck out two but didn't walk any, and had a 9/3 ground out to fly out ratio. Former Orioles Evan Meek and Josh Stinson also pitched in the game. Neither were great. Evan Meek has completely turned back into a pumpkin as he gave up three runs in 1 1/3 innings. Josh Stinson gave up a triple and then threw a wild pitch to allow a run to score. Worth noting, you'll recognize two of the players for Indianapolis. Both Chris Dickerson and Robert Andino are currently on the AAA team for the Pirates. Bowie Baysox 5, New Britain Rock Cats 4 (10) Friday night was a good night for the Schoop brothers. While little brother Jonathan was getting clutch RBI hits in Baltimore, big brother Sharlon homered for the Baysox in their walk off win against the Rock Cats. The Baysox tied the game in the 8th inning and went on to win in the bottom of the 10th on an RBI single from DH Chih-Hsien Chiang.    Starting pitcher Jake Pettit suffered from longball-itis, giving up four runs, all of which scored on three home runs, including one to former Orioles farmhand Brandon Waring. The good news is that in his seven innings pitched, Pettit only gave up runs in two (3rd & 4th). In the other five innings combined he gave up just two singles.    CF Dariel Alvarez with 0-for-4 with a walk, C Michael Ohlman went 1-for-4 with a double, and 1B Christian Walker went 0-for-4. Frederick Keys 4, Winston-Salem Dash 0 The story in Frederick last night was starting pitcher Matt Taylor. Taylor pitched 7 1/3 innings of shutout baseball with one walk and one strikeout. He did give up nine hits, but induced two double play balls and picked one runner off of first to keep himself out of trouble. Taylor has now given up just five earned runs in seven starts this season.    On offense, DH Lucas Herbst was 2-for-4 with a home run, and CF Glynn Davis tripled and scored, but also struck out three times. LF Michael Burgess and 3B Joel Hutter also doubled for the Keys. Delmarva Shorebirds 6, Augusta GreenJackets 4 Starting pitcher Sebastian Vader had a bit of a tough game as he gave up four runs in five innings pitched last night. He struck out one and walked one, and had a favorable GO/FO of 8/4. He gave up a home run to the very first batter he faced, but then cruised until the 5th inning when it fell apart on him. The big blow was a bases-clearing triple with two outs. Jon Keller pitched three scoreless innings in relief with five strikeouts, and Jimmy Yacabonis pitched the ninth for his eighth save.    The Shorebirds offense got to Augusta's starter for five runs in four innings, then tacked on one more in the 8th. LF Conor Bierfeldt was the only Shorebird to go hitless. RF Mike Yastrzemski tripled and scored, and C Austin Wynns and CF Gregory Lorenzo both had two hits, with Wynns picking up a double as part of his three-RBI night. 1B Trey Mancini had one single in four at bats.

Buck Showalter wants Davis to get a few at-bats under his belt, along with some reps at first base. Davis is eligible to come off the DL tomorrow; it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether he\xe2\x80\x99ll be activated or whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for the Detroit series on Monday, but the end to Davis\xe2\x80\x99 DL stint appears to be in sight none the less.Wei-Yin Chen pitched perhaps the best outing of the season thus far last night for the Birds. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7 IP, 5 H, 2 R, 1 BB, 4 K. Yes folks, that qualifies as a quality start. My takeaway with Wei-Yin Chen was that his off speed and breaking pitches were getting over for strikes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve hadCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsseveral former big league pitchers tell me personally that if you can\xe2\x80\x99t throw a major league fastball you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to make it in the majors. Having said that you also have to know how and when to drop something off speed in and get it by hitters, otherwise your pitches will start getting tagged. Wei-Yin Chen did that very consistently last night.Houston drew first blood when former Oriole and local native L.J. Hoes sent a sac fly to Nick Markakis in right, giving them a 1-0 lead. In fact, Markakis made a great play on the ball to catch it, turning what appeared to be an RBI-single into a sacrifice fly. However the Baltimore Orioles pushed right back in the last of the inning as Steve Pearce stayed hot and smacked a solo homer which barely made it over the left field wall. With two outs in the inning Manny Machado stepped to the plate, and promptly homered in his own right \xe2\x80\x93 Machado\xe2\x80\x99s first extra base hit and first hit overall at home of 2014.However Houston struck back in the seventh as Chris Carter made the baseball equivalent of a finger-tip catch in the NFL by sening a solo homer to left field to tie the score at two. (Okay c\xe2\x80\x99mon you gotta give me some sort of credit for pulling a reference like that!) Houston may not be a good team in terms of the standings, however to their credit they battled tooth and nail. They appear to have a young team that I feel will make some waves down the line.J.J. Hardy led off the last of the seventh with a double, which propelled the O\xe2\x80\x99s back into the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat. Hardy would later score on Jonathan Schoop\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-double, and Schoop himself would later score on an RBI-double by Nick Markakis. Tommy Hunter came in to close the game in the ninth and to protect a 4-2 lead, and ended up making things interesting. Carter came through for Houston again, this time with an RBI-groundout. However Hunter recorded the final out and the Baltimore Orioles defeated Houston 4-3 at Camden Yards.Many fans are starting to get frustrated with Hunter in terms of how he makes things more interesting in ninth innings. While that might be true, he\xe2\x80\x99s also bending but not breaking. The fact is that the day\xe2\x80\x99s going to come when the O\xe2\x80\x99s will give him a one-run lead and Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s going to blow a save which will result in an Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 loss. (It\xe2\x80\x99s already happened, but the Birds came back and won.) It happens to every closer. However the fact is that Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s managed to close all but one game thus far \xe2\x80\x93 is he the new Don Stanhouse? Perhaps. But as I said, he\xe2\x80\x99s bent but not broken.The O\xe2\x80\x99s have an interesting dilema facing them when Chris Davis is ready to return (be it tomorrow, Monday, or even beyond). Who goes down? I suspect that Steve Pearce has effectively removed himself as a candidate (for both on-field and contractual reasons). Many folks seem to think that David Lough could be a candidate, and they\xe2\x80\x99re probably correct. I would submit that a lot of that will be answered by Matt Wieters; if he\xe2\x80\x99s able to catch again in the near future, then Caleb Joseph might be the guy sent back down.The series with Houston continues tonight at Camden Yards with Miguel Gonzalez on the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Collin McHugh, who enters the game with a 2-1 record and a 2.79 ERA. However in his last start he gave up five earned runs and eight hits. The law of averages says that after a clunker like that he should throw a good game tonight. But he\xe2\x80\x99s also facing a lineup that\xe2\x80\x99s currently specializing in clutch hitting.

05/11/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters adds to Injury Frustrations', 'Apr 13, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles catcher Matt Wieters (32) hits a solo home run in the eighth inning against the Toronto Blue Jays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Blue Jays won 11-3. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are dealing with a series of injuries to various players that have made it impossible to place their projected starting lineup on the field together at any single point so far this season.The latest DL visitor is Matt Wieters, who switched places on the roster with the returning Chris Davis. And at the time Davis went on the list, Manny Machado had not yet returned to play. Along the way, J.J. Hardy also missed some games to nurse a hamstring malady.If one counts Ryan Flaherty as the projected primary starting second baseman for 2014 (though it appears Jonathan Schoop is now that player), Sunday was the first time the entire infield was together at the same time, though again, of course without Wieters.The Baltimore Orioles are not the only AL East team to have such difficulties, as injuries have been a storyline theme in the division so far for this 2014 season. But it is frustrating, even as the depth of the team has filled these holes well enough to place the Birds at the top of the tight AL East.Might the Orioles have gapped the rest of the division if they were fully healthy as expected? Maybe, but injury is part of the modern game. And honestly, it is not injury that has created whatever pitching deficiencies have been repeatedly seen for this first quarter of the season.We speculated just yesterday relative to the pending return of Davis that perhaps Wieters might go to the DL. It never really made complete sense that Matt could not throw without pain, while batting was no problem at all. Perhaps the pain was not felt with the swing, but seriously, DH-ing and rehabbing seem contrary to reason. Orioles fan can hope for Wieters to be a fast healer like his teammate Chris Davis.Adding to the frustration is the wonderful offensive start that Wieters has put together for the early part of the season. He goes on the DL with a .308 average, five doubles, five homers, and 18 RBIs.But there is no certainty that even if the four infielders can stay healthy for two weeks from now that Wieters will be back, or that the whole gang will be able to be together for the first time. In fact, the scenario is out there that this may be much worse \xe2\x80\x93 like, season-ending worse with surgery disallowing a return until spring training of 2015. (Ugh, that is the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve typed 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel good doing it.)Showalter said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll take a two-week or three-week period to see if we can get it managed and then if he can catch the rest of the year. Or if he\xe2\x80\x99s still having problems with it at the six-week mark, we will have to think about something else \xe2\x80\xa6 That\xe2\x80\x99s as frank as I can be about it. That\xe2\x80\x99s where we are with it.\xe2\x80\x9dAdding to the bad feeling and gravity of the situation is this further statement from Buck, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you do the nine months if he had to have the surgery \xe2\x80\x94 we are hoping he never has to and there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance it never has to happen \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s around six weeks and he\xe2\x80\x99s back for next year. You are talking about roughly July 1.\xe2\x80\x9dFor now, Wieters will stay with the team and seek to be a help with Steve Clevenger and Caleb Joseph. Discounting any move to bring in someone from the outside, it might be that Clevenger will play against right-handed starters and Joseph against lefties. Honestly, these guys are more than decent and I would expect better than anyone who could be found dispensable from another source.Remember the criticism of Dan Duquette for stockpiling catchers in the offseason? In fact, this turn of events gives the Baltimore Orioles a chance to evaluate these prospects for the future.\xc2\xa0We call them \xe2\x80\x9cprospects\xe2\x80\x9d but in fact, both of these guys and Matt Wieters were born within a span of two months. They could have all been in the church nursery together.Clevenger is currently 11-for-42 (.262) with six of those hits being doubles. Joseph is hitless in seven at-bats so far, but he has looked very adequate behind the plate.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles placed catcher Matt Wieters on the 15-day DL this morning due to lingering elbow soreness. Manager Buck Showalter told Orioles beat reporters that Wieters will be out at least three weeks to let the elbow \xe2\x80\x9cquiet down\xe2\x80\x9d before it is re-evaluated.If Wieters cannot throw by July 1, surgery could become an option \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps shutting the catcher down for the season.With Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 contract up at the end of next year, the Orioles need to decide soon if they want to sign him to an extension, trade him, or allow him to hit free agency in 2015. His injury gives the team a chance to explore its replacement options before they are forced to make a decision on the future of Wieters in Baltimore.The Orioles have other expensive paydays that might be coming in the near future in shortstop J.J. Hardy, who is a free agent after this year, and first baseman Chris Davis who, like Wieters, hits free agency in 2015.Trading Wieters or letting him walk would save the Orioles money that could be used to bring back Davis or Hardy.With Wieters out for what could be a month or more, the Orioles will use this time to evaluate their lineup without Wieters and see if it can afford to avoid signing him to a costly contract extension.So far this season, Wieters has been a crucial part of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense, batting .308/.339/.500 with five home runs and 18 RBI. For the Orioles to continue their winning ways, the new starting catcher would need to play a role in replacing that production.Who the new everyday catcher will end up being remains to be seen. For now, Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s own Steve Clevenger will do the majority of the catching, with 6-year minor league product Caleb Joseph backing him up.Clevenger has shown that he can be a factor with the bat in limited appearances in 2014. He is hitting .256/.326/.462 with six doubles and five RBI in 39 ABs. Clevenger also played hero in Saturday night\xe2\x80\x99s walk off win against the Houston Astros in the bottom of the tenth inning.However, Clevenger isn\xe2\x80\x99t guaranteed the job for the entirety of Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 absence. News broke yesterday that the Orioles were considering trade offers for left-handed reliever Troy Patton in hopes of receiving another catcher.This trade would solve two problems. First, it would get rid of one of four lefties in the Oriole bullpen, allowing the team to bring up another right-hander and alleviate the workload on Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Ryan Webb, and Tommy Hunter. Second, the new catcher would bump Joseph off the roster and give the Orioles another viable option if Clevenger proves that he should be limited to a reserve role.Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 injury could end up proving that he\xe2\x80\x99s expendable, which is a good thing for the Orioles. If either Clevenger or the return on the potential Patton trade performs well, the Orioles may be encouraged to part ways with Wieters sooner rather than later.While losing Wieters certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t benefit the 2014 Orioles, his injury gives the Orioles an opportunity to decide how valuable Wieters truly is to this team and plan for the future.

The difference between Norris's ERA and FIP looks a bit worrisome, but his HR/FB rate (13.9%) is a bit higher than one would expect (career: 10.9%), so he's probably been a little unlucky on flyballs thus far, driving up his FIP. Porcello has the best ERA of his career so far, with an even lower FIP to match. Part of his success this year is based on a very low walk rate (1.4 BB/9), which approaches Ueharan levels and is much lower than Porcello's career average (2.26 BB/9). Surprisingly, he's doing this with an unusually low groundball rate (43.9%; career 52.5%).  This may be because the righty seems to have changed his approach a bit from last year, throwing significantly fewer sinkers to same-handed batters (55% in 2013, 42% this year) and substituting more sliders and four-seamers. Against lefties, he'll throw a roughly even mix of four-seamers, sinkers, curves, and changeups, using the four-seamer to start at-bats, the change if he gets behind, and the curve to finish them off.    Maybe hot: Nick Markakis (1.099 OPS, 25 PA) Likely not: Nelson Cruz (.348 OPS, 23 PA) Tuesday, 13 May, 7:05 P.M.: Ubaldo Jimenez vs. Drew Smyly     Jimenez Smyly   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 182.2 40.0 76.0 27.1   ERA 3.30 4.73 2.37 2.96   FIP 3.43 4.66 2.31 3.82   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .239/.317/.367 .272/.361/.405 .219/.265/.336 .219/.286/.406        Jimenez wasn't able to duplicate his stellar effort in Minnesota, but he still had his second-best start of the year, allowing one run over 5.1 innings against Tampa Bay. He did allow  nine baserunners, however, so he had to weave out of trouble a few times, and his 2:3 K:BB ratio wasn't so good. Still, at least Bad Ubaldo spared us his presence for one more start. Smyly is back in Detroit's rotation after spending all of 2013 and the first week or so of this season in the bullpen. His ERA looks very good, but he's getting pretty lucky on balls in play (.257 BABiP, career .288) and is stranding a lot more runners than one would expect. Smyly, a lefty, threw four-seam fastballs and cutters 85% of the time last year, dropping in a curve for the rest. This year, he's throwing the curve a lot more and trying to disrupt right-handed batters' timing with occasional changeups (8%). He throws first-pitch four-seamers very reliably, nearly 75% of the time regardless of batter handedness.    Wednesday, 14 May, 12:35 P.M.: Wei-Yin Chen vs. Justin Verlander     Chen Verlander   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 137.0 41.0 218.1 54.0   ERA 4.07 3.95 3.46 2.67   FIP 4.04 3.14 3.28 2.90   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .272/.321/.440 .301/.333/.434 .253/.315/.376 .244/.310/.341     While Chris Tillman has gotten all the buzz thanks to his pair of eight-plus-inning stints in April, Chen has quietly put together the best season of any O's starter so far, already rating 1.1 WAR and just beating out Tillman in ERA. He's managed to cut down on walks a little compared to the last two years, and his groundball rate is over 40% for the first time since he came to the U.S. His ERA is nearly a run higher than his FIP, and while he's gotten a little lucky on flyballs so far (7.0% HR/FB vs. 10.6% career), he's been unlucky on balls in play more generally (.351 BABIP vs. .295 career). The main trouble with Chen is knowing when to pull him, because once he gets tired, he tends to fall apart rather than slowly decline. Managing seven innings in two of his last three starts probably isn't a sign that's changed, since those were against the Astros and Royals. Verlander's numbers look about as intimidating as ever, but there are some chinks in the armor this time around. His strikeout (7.17 K/9) and walk (3.50 BB/9) rates are the worst they've been since 2008, and he's gotten very lucky on flyballs so far (1.5% HR/FB). Camden Yards would be a nice place for the inevitable regression to happen. Verlander's pitching about the same as last year, throwing fastballs just over half of the time to both righties and lefties. Against righties, he'll throw sliders in any count, mixing in occasional curveballs and rare changeups. Against lefties, the righty throws the change to get ahead and turns to his curveball for the strikeout.    Maybe hot: J.J. Hardy (.853 OPS, 35 PA) Likely not: Adam Jones (.423 OPS, 32 PA)  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

But let\'s look beyond those furry cheeks he is grooming right now and learn a bit more about Mr. Pearce.

In fact, he took down the Oriole-champion,\xc2\xa0J.J. Hardy, in a spring training tournament*facts from MLB.com\'s Brittany Ghiroli   History Pearce played four years of college baseball. From 2002 through 2003 he was a member of Indian River Community College. After that, he transferred to South Carolina and played in both 2004 and 2005. While a Gamecock, he was impressive, hitting .346 with 21 home runs and 70 RBI as a junior and setting a school-record with a 1.000 fielding percentage at first base. His senior year was a worthy follow up; .346 average with 21 home runs and 63 RBI. In 2003, Pearce was picked by the Minnesota Twins in the 45th round \xc2\xa0of the amateur draft. He would not sign and instead enrolled at South Carolina. He was again drafted in 2004. This time in the 10th round by the Boston Red Sox. Yet again, he declined and returned to Columbia. He finally signed following his senior year, when he was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the eighth round.    In the minors, Pearce was well-regarded for his work with the lumber. Following a 2007 season that saw him climb quickly from the high-A Lynchburg Hillcats all the way to the Pirates big league squad, he was named the #89 prospect in the minors by Baseball America and the third best prospect in Pittsburgh\'s system. That same season also saw him capture the title of ""Best Hitter for Average"" and ""Best Power Hitter"" down on the Pirates farm.    Even though he made it to the big league club at a steady pace, Pearce never really stuck with the Pirates. He played in parts of five different seasons, never getting into more than the 60 games he saw in 2009. His power potential also failed to materialize, managing a meager nine home runs in those five seasons. Following 2011, Pearce would begin a whirlwind of transactions. He was granted free agency by Pittsburgh. He would sign with the Twins, but was released a week before Opening Day. The Yankees snapped him up two days later. He wouldn\'t make it into a game for the big league squad before the O\'s purchased his contract. Baltimore kept him for nearly two months before trying to sneak him through waivers. He wouldn\'t make it; Houston selected him and placed him right into the starting lineup.    Pearce stayed with the Astros for one month until a former team came calling. This time it was the Yankees again, who purchased his contract from Houston. Another month after that, the Orioles were able to get the versatile ball player the same way they lost him; via waivers. Since then, he has been an Oriole. However, he did nearly become a Blue Jay this past April, but instead he came back to Baltimore for a chance to play while Chris Davis was on the disabled list.   Scouting Report Pearce\'s worth is at the plate. His career major league numbers are nothing to write home about: a .240 batting average, .318 on base and a .386 slugging percentage. However, his numbers coming up through the farm are eye-grabbing. He boasts a .294 batting average with a .371 on base and a .522 slugging percentage in 622 minor league games. But the games in the show are what really count and Pearce has been just OK. The all-encompassing stat of Wins Above Replacement (WAR) reflects that. Fangraphs gives him a 0.5 WAR in his career, while Baseball Reference is a bit more lenient with their 1.2 WAR. Either way, he is considered a borderline major league player.    In the field, the Florida native has major league experience at first base, third base, right field and left field. By far, his skill set fits best at first base. His career zone rating per 150 games is a very good 5.9. That is better than current starter Davis\' rating of -2.3 at the position. Davis was a Gold Glove contender in 2013. However, Pearce rates negatively at the other three positions. So, while that number at first is nice. It isn\'t reason enough to be a regular in the big leagues when he doesn\'t have the power numbers to back it up.   What\'s Ahead There is a reason that Pearce has bounced between so many squads. He is good enough to be on a major league roster, however, not good enough to lock down a full time spot. His bat still has power potential and he plays a good enough defense to serve as a late-inning replacement on some teams. That said, he is 31 years old and the time to play the ""potential"" or ""upside"" card has nearly run out. This is a player that the Orioles value and don\'t want to lose. He provides depth at first and the corner outfield positions. As seen already this season, he can fill in admirably when needed. However, it\'s a numbers game and Pearce\'s career numbers seem to show that he will have a difficult time becoming anything more than a serviceable backup.

Buck may have left him in the game too long, which led to the game-sealing two-run home run and Torii Hunter being hit by a pitch, which cleared the benches.The defense continues to play well, which, as was said last season, is a consistent part of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 game. The Orioles would not be in the position they are without some consistent part.Without consistent pitching or offense, a 20-16 record is a very surprising record. If the Orioles can maintain a consistent offense or pitching, their record would be much better.In the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 wins in May, they have scored 35 runs, while allowing 20 runs. The offense averages above four runs per game, while the pitching holds the opposing teams below three runs in eight wins.Throughout the entire beginning part of the season, the Orioles win nearly all the games where they score four or more runs.The four-run mark is a common number across MLB for teams to win. In order to reach that mark, there must be pitching and offense.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense averages about four runs per game through 36 games. This would be a great number, but the pitching averaged just above four runs per game.The Orioles rarely have good pitching and offense simultaneously\xc2\xa0to put together long winning streaks.\xc2\xa0This has seemingly always been a problem for the Orioles, but really should not be\xc2\xa0relative to\xc2\xa0the powerful lineup they have.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching has frequently\xc2\xa0been the problem, and it continues to be the problem this season.\xc2\xa0And this is magnified when the offense also struggles to be consistent.For just the month of May, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching is allowing an average of just above three runs per game.\xc2\xa0However, the offense is averaging the same as the pitching is giving up, which leads to games like the last two Orioles losses. The offense goes just below average, while the pitching is average, and the result is a loss.The Orioles have been successful the past two seasons, but have barely been successful. Short streaks of offensive games or good pitching brought them into the playoffs two seasons ago and brought them close last season.In order to make a bigger impact, there needs to be consistency across the team. The Orioles need to figure out these aspects of their game in order to put together more than just streaks of offense and pitching, but make it a part of who they are as a team.

Sometimes they make decisions that do not work out and do not seem to make sense under any amount of scrutiny. They are smarter than us, and I would not claim otherwise. But they can look really dumb. The Orioles looked dumb today with their curious decision to call up top prospect Kevin Gausman to make his first big league start of the season, on three days rest, against a great-hitting team like the Tigers. It did not work out. The O\'s dropped the game 7-5, their fourth straight loss. Why would you ask a guy who\'s not far removed from the disabled list for a bad bout of pneumonia, who has not thrown more than 80 pitches in any of his minor league outings so far this year, to come up in this spot? If you really wanted Gausman in the rotation, why not call him up on regular rest? Why bump Miguel Gonzalez, who was fresh off his best outing of the season, into the bullpen, even temporarily? They must have had some reason for these things. Perhaps it made sense internally, given that they know many things we do not know. There were plenty of reasons to be anxious about the game ahead of time, given all of those factors. Gausman\'s performance on the day did nothing to abate the concerns. The only silver lining you can offer is that he did not allow any home runs, but he did allow five runs on six hits and two walks in only four innings before being pulled from the game. He threw nearly all fastballs and did not have great success with any other pitch. Whether his problem was a disruption of his routine or something else is the sort of thing that won\'t be shared with the public, even if the Orioles know. Will he stay? Will he go? We do not know. It\'s a shame that so much attention has to be paid to that curious decision, because the Orioles offense had a day that might otherwise be considered a breakout against an ace like Justin Verlander. The former Cy Young winner also gave up five runs, though he went six innings. He allowed six hits and a walk against four strikeouts, hardly the kind of performance you\'d expect from him. When you get a guy like Verlander on an off day, that is a game you need to win. Instead, the Orioles found another way to lose.    After Gausman left the game, the Orioles brought in Gonzalez. They telegraphed that this would probably occur in media reports, with repeated references during the MASN game broadcast to Gonzalez piggy backing Gausman. Of course, it\'s also three days rest for Gonzalez, and he is not used to being employed as some sort of long man. So he was pitching on short rest in an unusual role. Is that an excuse for giving up two runs (one earned) in two innings of work? No, but it still might be a reason, and that contributed to the Orioles losing today as well.    The unearned run came in the fifth inning thanks to Gonzalez throwing a ball into center field on a comebacker to the mound that should have been a double play ball. That run scored on a Don Kelly single, and it proved to be the run the Tigers would need, as it staked them to what was then a 6-0 lead. The Orioles offense finally struck in the bottom of the fifth. They scored all five of their runs in the inning, all with two outs. David Lough reached on a one-out single and advanced to second on a grounder by Nick Markakis. Lough was running on the pitch, which is all that saved the Orioles from an inning-ending double play. Manny Machado worked a walk. Back-to-back singles by Adam Jones and Chris Davis scored Lough and Machado, which brought up Nelson Cruz, who is the man.    In Cruz\'s previous at-bat in the fourth, there was a bit of an incident, and by ""incident"" I mean that Verlander blatantly threw a fastball behind Cruz about numbers-high. Everyone in the stadium could draw the conclusion that this was some kind of ""payback"" for what happened between Bud Norris and Torii Hunter in the first game of the series, with the key difference that Verlander made his pitch on purpose and Norris did not. Cruz stared at Verlander, unamused. Verlander aggressively took several steps towards home plate in what I can only assume was an attempt to escalate the situation. Cruz did not bite. In any case, after that, both benches were warned. Cruz got his revenge in that at-bat on an infield single to shortstop. A small victory. So, Cruz and Verlander and unfinished business, or whatever. In the fifth, with two men on, there were no more throws at anyone. There was a hanging pitch. Cruz turned on it for a three-run home run. The scoreboard is the best place to get revenge. This three-run shot was Cruz\'s 11th of the season and it brought the Orioles to within 6-5. Cruz has driven in 33 of the Orioles\' 155 runs. They chased Verlander out of the game after six innings, having gotten him to throw 110 pitches in that time. Some games it seems the Orioles don\'t get the other team to throw 110 pitches in nine innings.    The Tigers bullpen features bloated ERAs and physiques like Joba Chamberlain. They had three innings to get to them. That is the situation you want. They loaded the bases against Chamberlain in the eighth, with even Lough working a clutch two-out walk to bring up Markakis, who hit a lazy liner to center. It probably would have been enough to score a run had there been fewer than two outs. That\'s life. After hitting in 18 straight games, Markakis is now 0-13. On the plus side, Jones is heating up, with a three-hit game to extend a hitting streak to nine games. Ryan Webb, Troy Patton, and Brian Matusz all added scoreless innings for the O\'s. It doesn\'t matter. I just wanted to mention them. The Orioles now head to Kansas City for a four-game series against the Royals. In the opening game of the series on Thursday, they will face fireballer Yordano Ventura. What could possibly go wrong?

In addition to Miguel Cabrera\xe2\x80\x98s 3-run, go-ahead homer into the bullpen, and Victor Martinez\xe2\x80\x98s follow-up shot onto Eutaw Street, the first two outs of the top of the 9th inning were line drives, one a lazy looper to shortstop, and one a well-hit drive that Adam Jones ran down.Hunter lives too dangerously, and tonight it bit him again, and the Baltimore Orioles lost a heartbreaking, 4-1 game. He has allowed 23 hits and five walks in 15 innings worked over 17 games this season.But the fair and balanced part goes something like this. The Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t score enough runs. One more than the other team is enough based on track record, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what they had until the 9th inning.

The Orioles hurt themselves too often with anxious, selfish\xc2\xa0at-bats with runners on base, even though you could always say that\xe2\x80\x99s just good pitching by the opposing team.Drew Smyly matched Ubaldo Jimenez\xe2\x80\x98s sterling\xc2\xa0performance with one of his own, the one exception being\xc2\xa0Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 screaming liner that just got over the left field wall in the first inning.Not to give short shrift to the\xc2\xa0other\xc2\xa0bright spot, catcher Caleb Joseph stole the show, getting\xc2\xa0his first Major League hit and throwing out two base runners, which would have been three if a replay review had not overturned one. Rajai Davis appeared\xc2\xa0out at second on his attempted steal as a pinch-runner with none out in the fateful 9th. But a replay overturned the call, and Torii Hunter walked to bring up Cabrera.Now, the expected hue and cry will rise\xc2\xa0for manager Buck Showalter to replace Hunter as closer. The only thing he would commit to after the game was that adjustments would be made if necessary to make the team competitive. Showalter has never been, and still is not, the type to name names while on camera. To summarize Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s remarks,\xc2\xa0they were what we already knew \xe2\x80\x93 that he hated to lose, and that you can\xe2\x80\x99t hit that many bats in a save situation. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say much more than the fairly obvious.As the saying goes, the sun will come up tomorrow.

The Tigers defeated the Orioles 7-5 completing the three game sweep. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWho would have thought that about one-quarter of the way through the baseball season the American League East would be the division where the leading team would have the worst record of any of the six teams leading divisions? That first-place team is the Baltimore Orioles at 20-18. Of course the Yankees and Red Sox are only a half-game behind at 20-19, and the Jays likewise have 20 wins but against 21 losses. And finally the Rays are last at 18-23.The Baltimore Orioles, like everyone else in the league, can point to varied injuries and missing players as an explanation for some of the problem. Lineups are about as varied as the total number of games. Get Machado back, lose Davis; get Davis back, lose Wieters, etc.But the issue is not limited to this. Inconsistent play is at least as large a factor. Adam Jones has only recently warmed up. Nick Markakis hit through a consecutive games streak, but went completely hitless against the Tigers. Even Nelson Cruz was in a 7-for-35 (.200) prior to his two hits and homer yesterday. J.J. Hardy can\xe2\x80\x99t find any way to hit a homer.That is the offence. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not even go into the pitching, since so much has been written about it by everyone, along with it being the area of greater concern going into the season. Who would have expected this offense to struggle so much, especially at home?A mark of a team simply being out of sync and not playing well is an inability to put the offence and defense together. For some reason, it simply happens this way. A team will lose three close, low-scoring games, but then finally have a breakout day at the plate, only to have the opponent score even more. And that sort of describes the current four-game losing streak. The Orioles score four runs in three games, only to score five in one inning against none less than Justin Verlander, yet still lose 7-5.The good news for the Orioles is that even with all of the scuffling of the early season, a record of 20-18 is the best in the AL East, if only by a slim margin. The bad news is that an opportunity has been lost to gain some separation from those opponents at what might prove to have been their most vulnerable time. Another way of saying this is to turn this article title around and say that the AL East has the best, last-place team!Maybe it is good at this juncture for the Baltimore Orioles to head out on the road where they have a better record than at home. This trip will begin today with four games in Kansas City \xe2\x80\x93 no hitters\xe2\x80\x99 paradise for sure.And the Orioles will again face a young pitcher in Yordano Ventura who totally shut them down on April 25th with no runs in eight innings, giving up seven hits with striking out eight. He is 2-2 for the season with a 2.34 ERA and WHIP of 1.11.The Birds will turn to Wei-Yin Chen and hope he has some good stuff working. Chen is 4-2 with a 3.95 ERA. However, over his career, he has had some difficulties with the Royals. In five starts he is 0-1 with a 4.60 ERA. A number of Royals hitters have good numbers against him: Billy Butler is 8-for-15 with two home runs, Eric Hosmer 6-for-14 with two home runs, Alex Gordon 3-for-13 with 1 home run, and Alcides Escobar 4-for-15.

The O\xe2\x80\x99s had called Kevin Gausman up from triple-A Norfolk to make the start, sending Miguel Gonzalez to the bullpen. Gausman was smacked around in his short outing; after the game Buck Showalter said that he was looking for about 85 pitches out of Gausman in total; Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4 IP, 6 H, 5 R, 2 BB, 2 K. Showalter went onto say that Gausman had a great first inning, although the O\xe2\x80\x99s were looking to get a bit more out of him.Detroit loaded the bases on Gausman in the third, and Miguel Cabrera\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single gave them a 2-0 lead. Just prior to that however Ian Kinsler hit an infield single in order to load the bases\xe2\x80\xa6a ball that might have resulted in an out (the final out of the inning) had it not hit off the mound. When things aren\xe2\x80\x99t going well, those are the types of bounces you get. Detroit would also plate three runs on Gausman in the fourth, netting them a 5-0 lead and chasing Gausman. They would also plate a run in the fifth off of Miguel Gonzalez to run the score to 6-0.So the fireworks started in the last of the fourth with Chris Davis on first base after a walk and Nelson Cruz at the plate. Verlander threw a pitch behind Nelson Cruz (allowing Davis to head to second base), which bristled a few feathers in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout. Whether or not this was \xe2\x80\x9cretribution\xe2\x80\x9d for Bud Norris \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally\xe2\x80\x9d throwing at Torii Hunter on Monday is something that only Justin Verlander knows. However home plate umpire John Tumpane apparently thought something was up \xe2\x80\x93 and thus issued warnings to both benches.In my opinion, this is an alarming trend in baseball, which I\xe2\x80\x99ve started to see across the board. Baseball is a sport that\xe2\x80\x99s always policed itself in a sense, and there is a certain aspect of\xc2\xa0blind American justice in some of these situations. However I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed that whenever something like this happens the umpires immediately are warning\xc2\xa0both benches. Buck Showalter was livid at this yesterday; by warning the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bench Tumpane not only punished the victim in a sense, but he took away the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 ability to pitch inside without risk of a pitcher (and Showalter) being tossed.I suppose the idea behind warning both benches is to head off a fight/bean ball war before it starts. But do umpires and MLB as a whole really want to be in the business of keeping this type of stuff pent up? In old school baseball someone on the Orioles would have thrown over a Detroit player\xe2\x80\x99s head later in the game, and then\xc2\xa0both benches would be warned. Furthermore as Showalter said after the game, the umpires decided to judge intent on Bud Norris on Monday and they threw him out of the game. There had to be a thought that there was intent on Verlander\xe2\x80\x99s part given that they warned the benches \xe2\x80\x93 yet no ejection?However it\xe2\x80\x99s also very possible that Verlander did the Orioles a favor. Their bats, which hadCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportspreviously gone to sleep, seemed to wake up. Adam Jones and Chris Davis delivered with RBI-singles in the last of the fifth, and Nelson Cruz came back to the plate with two on. With the count at 1-2, Cruz took revenge on Verlander by smacking a three-run homer out of the park and in the process putting the Orioles right back into the game.The fact is that ultimately the O\xe2\x80\x99s dropped the game 7-5, and in the process were swept in the series. However that\xe2\x80\x99s the type of incident that could help the Orioles to win the war after losing the battle. The act of Verlander throwing behind Cruz, combined with the fire shown by Buck Showalter in going after umpire Tumpane could have been just what the doctor ordered. We won\xe2\x80\x99t truly know that until the Orioles play a few more games, but it seemed to work yesterday.Some people will probably question my commentary above in that it might come across as if I\xe2\x80\x99m advocating fighting. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the case; however keep in mind that more so than any other sport baseball has very old traditions. One of them is that you don\xe2\x80\x99t let other teams show you up or push you around. Traditionally, umpires \xe2\x80\x9cget this.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s Cole Hamels hitting Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Bryce Harper a few years ago. A few innings later Washington hit a Philadelphia batter, and\xc2\xa0then\xc2\xa0warnings were issued. That\xe2\x80\x99s good, traditional umpiring. Sure that\xe2\x80\x99s allowing and perhaps even advocating retaliation on my part, however that\xe2\x80\x99s a part of the game. It\xe2\x80\x99s always been a part of the game, and personally I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something that should always be a part of the game.The O\xe2\x80\x99s will now lick their wounds and head to Kansas City for a four-game set. The Baltimore Orioles remain in first place by a half game over Boston in the AL East, and of course they dropped two-of-three to Kansas City at the yard a few weeks ago. So this is an instance where the Birds really need solid starting pitching and for the bats to prove that they\xe2\x80\x99ve come around. Wei-Yin Chen will get the starting nod tonight, after being pushed back a night in favor of Gausman yesterday. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Yordano Ventura, who the O\xe2\x80\x99s remember all too well from the series at Camden Yards. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
05/16/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Beginning of the Zach Britton Era?', 'May 15, 2014; Kansas City, MO, USA; Baltimore Orioles relief pitcher Zach Britton (53) delivers a pitch against the Kansas City Royals in the ninth inning at Kauffman Stadium. Baltimore won 2-1. Mandatory Credit: John Rieger-USA TODAY SportsCould it be that a new era in Baltimore Orioles baseball was begun last evening in Kansas City? Zach Britton came on to set down the Royals 1-2-3 in the ninth inning and save a 2-1 victory. It was the first such ninth inning this year, and the first save opportunity for the Orioles after the recent Tommy Hunter implosion.Britton sure had the look of a great closer, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking about fastball velocity, a killer sinker, and aggressive approach. I am equally referencing the body language and pitching mound demeanor. From his first steps running in the from the bullpen to his walks around the mound between outs, there was a body language attitude of \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in control here, and you are not going to be running around the bases; pack your bat bag in the dugout, because we are going home soon.\xe2\x80\x9dBritton has not always looked this way. He never had the nervous fear of a Jake Arrieta or the sometimes overwhelmed confusion of Brian Matusz a couple years ago, but there were times you could see on his face that he was in over his head \xe2\x80\x93 that his stuff just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t working like he wanted, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do to fix it.Could Britton be a successful starter if stretched out into that role? My guess is that, yes, he could be that guy. But could his better role to help this club be what we saw last night? Well, on this date of May 16, 2014 I am going to say \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d to that. With his starter\xe2\x80\x99s stuff and background in pitching for longer periods, could Britton be a shut-down reliever who could pitch in a rather high number of games compared to most others, being brought in more frequently and even for occasional longer stretches than just a final several outs? If so, that is a hugely valuable pitcher. He could impact not only one game every five days, he could have an impact on up to nearly one-half of all games.Over the previous two seasons, Jim Johnson pitched in 71 and 74 games for the Orioles. If Britton were to be just a bit stronger with an ability to return to game after game in varied stretches of the season, it would not take that much more before he is impacting almost half of all Orioles contests. Johnson was 15th in MLB last year in 74 appearances. The highest was 80 games by Joel Peralta of the Rays \xe2\x80\x93 though Peralta only pitched one more inning than Johnson, and the two of them actually faced the exact same number of batters \xe2\x80\x93 291.For reasons we could explore in another article someday, the Baltimore Orioles get into an unusual number of close games in late innings that call upon relievers to shut down an opponent in the final couple of innings with no margin of error. Showalter referenced this very observation a couple of days ago, and since it happens, Zach Britton\xe2\x80\x99s skill could prove the most valuable commodity on this squad.Series Game One \xe2\x80\x93 Orioles 2, Royals 1Even though the Orioles struck out a total of 13 times \xe2\x80\x93 nine of which were against the powerful pitching of Royals starter Yorlando Ventura \xe2\x80\x93 they managed two runs on a walk and homer by Nelson Cruz. Wei-Yin Chen pitched well enough to maintain the lead with only a run given up in 5.1 innings, and the bullpen shut the door the rest of the way, capped off by Britton\xe2\x80\x99s ninth inning.Series Game Two \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Tillman vs. Jeremy GuthrieIn a matchup of a previous top starter versus the current staff leader, Chris Tillman will look to get a victory over former Oriole Jeremy Guthrie.Tillman will also look to get back to top form as displayed in his early games of the season. His most recent set of starts have been rough, making it through six innings only once in the past four. In his last outing against the Astros, Tillman issued five walks in five innings.This will be Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s first start against KC this year. Over his career of four starts against the Royals he is 1-2 with a 9.00 ERA. His one start at Kauffman Stadium lasted 3.2 innings and yielded eight runs on 10 hits. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to report those numbers early in the morning.Guthrie is 2-2 on the season with a 4.80 ERA. As with\xc2\xa0Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s season, both pitchers\xc2\xa0have had a very mixed bag of results: some of which are extraordinary, whereas half of the others were very, very hard work and quite mediocre.Guthrie has three career starts against the Orioles and has done well with a 2-0 record and 1.89 ERA over 19 total innings. The only decent numbers against him are by Nick Markakis at 3-for-8. Delmon Young is 4-for-27, Nelson Cruz 4-for-21, and J.J. Hardy 2-for-11. Chris Davis has a home run in 16 at-bats, but that is all, and Adam Jones is hitless in eight plate appearances.Putting all historic stats together, the Baltimore Orioles have no chance of winning this game. But, the stats don\xe2\x80\x99t play the game. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Game One Versus Royals Sets Template ...', 'Mandatory Credit: Joy R.

Zach Britton replaced Tommy Hunter as the closer for the night, recording his first career save.Britton successfully recorded the save through a 1-2-3 inning, which Hunter was never able to do in his 11 saves on the season.Nelson Cruz proved to be the offense for the Orioles again, recording his 12th home run and 34th and 35th RBIs. His offense alone was enough to secure the win behind one-run baseball through five and one-third innings from Wei-Yin Chen, who is now 5-2.Between the large ballpark in Kansas City and a strong pitching staff, the Orioles are going to have trouble scoring runs, despite their success on the road this season. Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s game was proof of this.The Orioles have never had major success in Kansas City, and the pitching is going to have to do well to compensate for the lack of offense.The current Orioles are a combined 10 for 51 with one home run against the next three starters for the Royals. Those starters at the time of this article are Jeremy Guthrie (6 for 26), Danny Duffy (0 for 1), and James Shields (3 for 24, 1 home run) for games two, three, and four of the series respectively.Buck Showalter mentioned the excellent pitching from Kansas City by sayings fans would not be getting discounts on pizza during this series. The local Baltimore-area Dominos give Orioles fans discounts when the offense puts up five or more runs in a win.If the pitching needed to improve, now is the time, because the inconsistent offense is going to have problems overcoming good pitching in a pitcher-friendly ballpark.The remaining Orioles starters, at this time, are Chris Tillman, Bud Norris, and Ubaldo Jimenez.This 2014 Royals team has not faced Tillman or Norris yet, but they did win 5-0 against Jimenez earlier in the season.Jimenez gave up six hits with four walks, while personally giving up three runs (charged with four given up by T.J. McFarland in relief).Tillman and Norris have to take advantage of the Royals having no first-hand experience against this season.If the Royals pitch as well as they can, one mistake by the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching staff could cost them a game. I do not expect an offensive showing by the Orioles, but I sure hope they prove me wrong.In the case of small leads, the bullpen has to maintain the streak it has generated lately. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99day and Troy Patton have been pitching very well, and they need to continue this success if the Orioles are going to get out of Kansas City with more than just one win.The Orioles won the close game on Thursday, and the pitching is going to have to pitch well again if the Orioles are going to continue to have success against the Royals.

(AP) \xe2\x80\x94 In the span of just a couple innings, the Baltimore Orioles went from struggling to break up a perfect game to having the winning run on second base with two outs in the ninth inning.They nearly turned a miserable night into a memorable one.Instead, Royals closer Greg Holland rebounded to strike out Nelson Cruz, preserving Kansas City\'s 1-0 victory Saturday night. It also made a winner of Danny Duffy, who had a perfect game going until Adam Jones sent a single up the middle with two outs in the seventh inning.""We found a way to get back in it in the ninth and had the right guys at the plate,"" said Orioles bench coach John Russell, who acted as manager as Buck Showalter attended his daughter\'s graduation. ""We still found a way to make it interesting.""Duffy (2-3) was pulled after another single in the eighth, but the Orioles were unable to build off it against reliever Wade Davis. Holland came in for the ninth and gave up a single and two walks to load the bases for Cruz, who struck out with the game on the line.Bud Norris (2-4) was the hard-luck loser, allowing four hits and a walk in 7 1-3 innings.The lone run he allowed came in the first, when Nori Aoki led off with a single, stole second and then scored on Butler\'s single to center. The hit ended a 0-for-10 slump, and gave Kansas City only its second run in the first three games of the four-game set.""Their guy was pretty tough tonight,"" Norris said. ""It was a tough one to lose. I\'m trying to put up zeroes. That\'s the ultimate goal.""Duffy missed most of last season while recovering from Tommy John surgery, and he began this season in the bullpen after losing the competition for a rotation spot in spring training. But he was forced back into the rotation a few weeks ago, when Bruce Chen landed on the disabled list with a back injury, and has pitched so well that he may have claimed the spot for good.After struggling with control most of his first three seasons, Duffy has finally started to harness his stuff. He allowed one run on two hits in four innings in his first start May 3 against Detroit, and one run on two hits in six innings last week in Seattle.He wound up losing both games when the Royals failed to score a run for him.Perhaps with that in mind, Duffy kept the Orioles off the scoreboard entirely. He never got close to allowing a hit until Caleb Joseph hit a liner at third baseman Mike Moustakas to end the sixth inning, and Alex Gordon made a spectacular diving catch on Nick Markakis\'s flyball to lead off the seventh. Duffy then struck out Manny Machado before Jones delivered his single.""I heard somebody say this is the type for, like, a perfect game,"" said the Orioles\' Caleb Joseph. ""Right after that, somebody said, \'Jonesy is about to rip one right here.\'""Asked whether he took any satisfaction in breaking up the perfect game, Jones replied: ""I don\'t care about all that. I just don\'t want to see it done against my team.""The crowd gave Duffy a standing ovation after the hit, and then another when he exited the game. Duffy sheepishly waved his cap in appreciation as he entered the dugout.""I was just trying to stay calm,"" Duuffy said. ""Mechanics will come through on their own if you trust your stuff, you don\'t overdo anything. And we were on the attack all day.""NOTES: Jones has a 12-game hitting streak. ...

Not enough to give Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans discounted pizza, but enough behind Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s start to bring home the win.Guthrie did limit the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 chances with runners in scoring position as they went 1-for-3.The offense successfully put up four runs, but did leave five men on base throughout the game. Even with the chances missed, four runs is the favorite number for the Orioles.With the 4-0 victory, the Orioles are now 14-4 when they score at least four runs. The Orioles scored four runs in attempted comebacks in three of the four losses.That does leave the Orioles with an 8-14 record in situations when they score less than four runs.When the Orioles can put up four runs in non-comeback situations, the pitching actually works with the offense to have a .933 winning percentage.When analyzing the 14-4 record deeper, later in the season, this stat could become clouded by bad pitching and failed comebacks.The key to focus on is when the offense scores four runs with the lead, the Orioles win. If the offense can maintain some consistency, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching has the track record to play well with the offense.As a fan who watched the Orioles during the bad years, this is a new type of play for them. The pitching had no real consistency, and did not complement the offense.Now, the numbers seem to say this, but I will hold off on saying this is for certain until later in the season. In the meantime, I will analyze the last two seasons to see how true my analysis is.But as of right now, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense needs to go for the number four.Danny Duffy is the next pitcher the offense will have to deal with. The Orioles faced Duffy as a relief pitcher in Baltimore.The Orioles scored one unearned run on Duffy as he only faced three batters. The last time Duffy faced Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 batters was in 2011 with many players no longer on the team.This is the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 chance to take another win away from Duffy, who has much less experience playing against Baltimore.However, that also means the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 batters have not faced Duffy much at all. There are only two players, Delmon Young and Jemile Weeks, who have more than five at-bats against Duffy since 2011.If the offense can reach the magic number of four, according to my numbers, the pitching should lead the Orioles to a win.

Gordon, who led the Royals with 20 home runs last year, had gone 134 at-bats without a home run.Gordon homered in his next at-bat, a three-run shot off left-hander Troy Patton in the seventh after Eric Hosmer walked and Butler doubled for his third hit.The Kauffman Stadium crowd then gave Gordon a lengthy standing ovation, calling him out of the dugout. Gordon said he had ""never"" had a curtain call.""I didn\'t know what to do,"" Gordon said. ""They told me just to go wave my helmet. They just started yelling at me. I was downstairs enjoying the moment. They told me to come up and give the crowd a wave. It was my first. Hopefully, it\'s not the last. It was pretty cool. It\'s something I want forget.""It\'s fun when we play like this and the crowd starts doing what they do. It makes it really exciting.""It was Gordon\'s third career multi-homer game. His six RBIs matched a Royals\' season high. His four hits matched a career high, the 10th time he has accomplished that.""Even though I was making good pitches, they found a way to hit the ball hard.  I felt really good and I made a lot of good pitches,"" Jimenez said. ""They had a good approach. I threw a lot of sinkers down and they found the hole every time. They had a really good game. There\'s nothing I can do but move on.""Gordon\'s second homer turned out to be necessary. Adam Jones hit a three-run homer off Royals reliever Aaron Crow in the ninth. It was the first runs Crow allowed in 20 relief appearances and 17 innings.Greg Holland got the final two outs for his 12th save in 13 appearances.James Shields (6-3) picked up his fifth win in six starts, holding the Orioles to three runs and nine hits over seven innings. Shields won back-to-back starts at Kauffman Stadium for the first time.Shields settled down after a three-run third when he gave up five hits, including four straight to open the inning.""The difference (was) I was getting my ground balls and they found holes,"" Shields said of the third inning. ""I was making my pitches, trying to get a double play that inning and they were just finding some good holes.""Jimenez, who was 2-0 with a 0.46 ERA in his first three May starts, was pulled after five innings. He permitted five runs on eight hits with one walk and seven strikeouts.""The pitch to Gordon was uncharacteristic,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""He had, really, just the one (bad) pitch to Gordon. He tried to go down and away, and it came back in and came into a sweet spot. He hadn\'t walked anybody to that point, either. Except for one pitch I thought he was good. After the first inning he was pretty crisp.""Nick Markakis singled home J.J. Hardy, who had three hits, and David Lough in the Orioles\' third. Manny Machado, who had three hits, had a sacrifice fly in the third to score Jonathan Schoop for the other run off Shields.Butler singled home Aoki with two outs in the first for the first Kansas City run. Lorenzo Cain\'s single in the fourth scored Gordon with the other Royals\' run.Notes: RHP Dylan Bundy, the Orioles\' top prospect and the fourth overall pick in the 2011 draft, is scheduled to throw an inning in extended spring Tuesday in Florida.

But they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the easiest path to get there.What if I told you Manny Machado spent a month on the DL, J.J. Hardy and Chris Davis both had DL stints and Matt Wieters hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played since May 11th, and may not play again this year.What if I told you the starting pitchers were a combined 14-17 with an ERA of 4.04? And that closer Tommy Hunter has already lost his job.Jonathan Schoop has as many home runs as Chris Davis, and more than Nick Markakis, Manny Machado and J.J. Hardy combined.Their leader in average, Wieters, is on the DL. Second is currently playing for Norfolk (Steve Lombardozzi) and third is a part-time starter (Delmon Young).David Lough is hitting .177. Ubaldo Jimenez is 2-5. Not exactly what you were looking for from those two acquisitions is it?Despite all this, the Birds are only half a game out of first place, and also the fifth best team in the American League, and tenth best in all of baseball.How is that the case? They are a few numbers to point to.One, the Orioles are once again the best defensive team in the AL, and that is even with their defense being worse than last year so far.The Orioles are back to having good numbers in one-run games, currently sitting at 10-4, tied with Milwaukee for the best in baseball.The Orioles also have been pretty good with runners in scoring position as a team, something they have struggled with previously.And although their stats aren\xe2\x80\x99t great, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Brian Matusz and particularly Zach Britton have formed a formidable group in the bullpen. Britton is now at closer, but these three helped keep the Orioles ahead in numerous games already.The best for the Orioles is yet to come. The hitters have not put it together for more than a couple games. The starting pitching has been very inconsistent, yet is starting to pitch much better.As the entire AL East (and much of baseball) is decimated with injuries, parity looks to be the name of the game this year in America\xe2\x80\x99s Pastime. For the Orioles, consistency can take them to the top. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles fall in part to three-run homers', 'It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say how Kansas City beat the Baltimore Orioles yesterday. Well, in truth it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty easy call \xe2\x80\x93 Alex Gordon\xe2\x80\x98s three-run homers (2). However in order to hit three-run homers, you have to get guys on base in front of the guy that hits the home run. The Orioles played every shift in the book yesterday (and really all series long); and in doing so it seems they played right into Kansas City\xe2\x80\x99s hands.The only shift that would have stopped Kansas City\xe2\x80\x99s players from getting on base was one that would have plugged the middle of the infield. They hit a lot of balls back up the middle of a hard infield that seemed catered for that exact purpose. That\xe2\x80\x99s partially my argument against playing all of these shifts \xe2\x80\x93 it probably does work most of the time. But when you get a team like Kansas City or Tampa who\xe2\x80\x99s entire goal is to hit-for-average and in effect play small ball, it can also play right into their hands.Ubaldo Jimenez struggled through five innings, in a park where he had previously pitched fairly well. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 8 H, 5 R, 1 BB, 7 K. Kansas City got to him immediately in the game, as Brett Butler sent an RBI-single down the line in right in the first inning to give them a 1-0 lead. However Jimenez settled down a bit in the second and third, and the Orioles struck back in the top of that third inning. Following singles by J.J. Hardy and David Lough, Jonathan Schoop loaded the bases with a bunt that was designed to move the runners over. Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x98 subsequent two-RBI single put the Orioles in the lead, and Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x98s sac fly-RBI put them ahead 3-1.Kansas City got to within one (at 3-2) in the last of the fourth on Cain\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single. However prior to that we had a bit of controversy as Perez hit into the shift up the middle, and the Orioles netted what appeared to be a force out at second base in erasing Alex Gordon (who later scored). However Kansas City manager Ned Yost challenged the play, and the umpires ruled that Gordon was safe. Granted we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the umpires in New York were seeing, however at the very least the call appeared to me to be inconclusive (meaning that the call on the field should have been upheld). Had Gordon initially been ruled safe and Showalter had challenged, I would have anticipated the same inconclusive result.With two runners on (one a walk and the other a Butler hit against the shift) in the last of the fifth, Gordon put Kansas City ahead for good with his first three-run homer of the day. The O\xe2\x80\x99s had the tying run at the plate with nobody down in the seventh however Adam Jones struck out, Chris Davis grounded out, and Nelson Cruz flied out.Following an Eric Hosmer lead off walk in the last of the seventh, Brett Butler once again came through with a double \xe2\x80\x93 putting two runners into scoring position. That brought Gordon to the plate again, and for the second consecutive time he smacked a three-run homer out of the park. Given the fact that Adam Jones attempted to bring the Orioles back in the ninth with a three-runCourtesy of Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sportshomer of his own, that in and of itself was probably the play of the game.Part of the problem is that Oriole pitchers were nibbling on the corners all day. One thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed over a long period of time is that umpires aren\xe2\x80\x99t so giving when it comes to called strikes when you try to nibble on the corners. Troy Patton was guilty of this in the seventh inning, as was Jimenez. Offensively, the O\xe2\x80\x99s went 3-for-10 with RISP. Given that the final margin of defeat was two, if even one more hit comes with one or more runners in scoring position, perhaps the result is different.Obviously Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s second three-run homer was the killer in a sense, regardless of what Adam Jones did in the ninth. However it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that for the second time in a week the Orioles had a call overturned in which it appeared that the evidence was inconclusive at best. We can\xe2\x80\x99t be too quick to criticize given the fact that unlike in the NFL, the umpires aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking at the exact same replays as we are. (And if you want to know how I know that, I asked an NFL ref on the field before a preseason game a few years ago \xe2\x80\x93 he said that FOX/CBS actually provides the replays to them from the TV feed.) Furthermore, the umpires on the field aren\xe2\x80\x99t physically making the calls, the umpires in NY are.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are off tomorrow, before opening up a two-game set in Pittsburgh. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see how Buck Showalter alters his lineup, as he\xe2\x80\x99ll lose a bat and his pitchers will have to swing the lumber.\xc2\xa0Going back to the shift failing the O\xe2\x80\x99s in this game, you also have to look at the flip side. Whenever Kansas City would shift it\xe2\x80\x99s infield, it would seemingly work. Again, Kansas City is a team that just wants to hit-for-average. While the power hasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily been there for the Orioles thus far, their aim is still to out-slug you. Which partially attests as to why the shifts always seem to work for their opponents. Teams like Kansas City practice hitting the ball the other way against the shift, whereas the Orioles figure that if they can hit doubles or hit the ball out of the ballpark the shift is pointless anyway. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Is the American League East a weak ...', 'I\xe2\x80\x99ve always said that the American League East is the de facto best division in sports. That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a debatable point, and quite frankly I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that some people would argue that the NFC West of the NFL is in the discussion \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly up there to say the least. However there can be little doubt that the AL East is one of the strongest divisions in sports. Or can there be \xe2\x80\x93 doubt, that is?In the past week I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard several people argue that the division is fairly weak. And seeing that New York is only 23-20 and in first place, I suppose that they have an argument. However I would submit that it\xe2\x80\x99s still quite the opposite. The Baltimore Orioles were in first place until yesterday when they were overtaken by NY. However they\xe2\x80\x99re still only a half game back. Ultimately Tampa is in last place, and they\xe2\x80\x99re still well within striking distance at five games back.I think that to say that the AL East isn\xe2\x80\x99t strong is in effect comparable with not looking past theCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sportstip of your nose. Granted there are also a lot of injuries in the division, including Matt Wieters of the O\xe2\x80\x99s. However generally when you see a division with teams bunched as closely as these five teams are bunched, it indicates that the division is in fact incredibly strong given the fact that they beat up on each other.This isn\xe2\x80\x99t an absolute science, and everyone\xe2\x80\x99s entitled to their opinion. However in the power-happy American League East, ask yourself how many other division winners would be competitive? Detroit would for sure, and I think many people would argue Oakland as well. However I think Oakland is much happier hitting for average in their massive ballpark than they are for power. But I think that many of the National League division leaders would be eaten alive.On the flip side, how many American League East teams would dominate in other divisions? For sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s very tough to say. The Orioles have struggled against the AL Central this year, but last place Cleveland is coming to town this weekend. Ultimately this isn\xe2\x80\x99t an absolute discussion one way or the other, however the fact is that in the American League East we see a lot of battle tested teams that know how to win.The big issue with playing in such a hotly contested division comes in the end when it\xe2\x80\x99s determined who goes to the post season. While division opponents beat up on each other, second place teams in the central and west can easily sneak up and into wild card contention \xe2\x80\x93 leapfrogging what might be a stronger team from the AL East. Again, some people will point only to the result and argue\xc2\xa0if they made the playoffs then they were obviously better.\xc2\xa0The records were better 5-10 years ago in a sense because it was only two teams (Boston & New York) competing for the division title each year. Now the entire division is in essence doing so, thus it stands to reason that top to bottom the American League East is the best division in sports. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

He grew up in Akron, Ohio; (No, he isn\'t pals with LeBron) the son of Dennis and Denise. I mean, come on! How adorable is that? Dennis (he goes by Denny) worked at a Goodyear plant that built race tires in Akron for forty years. Denise is, and has been for over thirty years, a cashier at a grocery store in town. In high school, Lough was a four sport athlete. He would play football and soccer in the fall, basketball in the winter, and baseball in the spring. His best sport? You guessed it...soccer! The future major leaguer was recruited by numerous division I programs for soccer. It was his passion. However, the family did not have a lot of money and none of these programs were offering enough in terms of scholarships. Smaller schools, like division II Mercyhurst, really liked Lough\'s abilities on the football field and baseball diamond. They offered a full ride if he would play the two sports.    He enrolled and became a business and accounting major. It was quite a different route from his siblings, Damon and Danielle, who both studied science. One became a high school physics and chemistry teacher. The other is a chemical engineer.    In the fall, he was the kicker, punter, wide receiver, and return specialist for the college\'s football team. After practices he would run drills for major league scouts. Sometimes, he would still be wearing his leg pads while taking batting practice or running sprints. In the spring, he was the starting outfielder and part of the ground\'s crew for the Lakers\'\xc2\xa0baseball team. The college baseball season starts in mid-February. In Erie, PA, where Mercyhurst is located, that is right in the heart of winter. Rather than allowing the snow to melt, Lough and his teammates were responsible for clearing off the baseball diamond with shovels, trash cans and anything else they could find.    Following his junior season he was named a third-team All-American and selected by the Royals in the eleventh round of the amateur draft. He signed and left school before finishing his degree. Don\'t worry, he went back in the 2012 off-season and earned a degree in sports marketing. In the minors Lough was never highly regarded. At his peak, Baseball America had him rated as the tenth best prospect in the Royals farm system. As he stewed away and played season after season at Triple-A Omaha his ranking plummeted before getting his first big league call-up in September of 2012. He had a 20 game-long cup of coffee with KC that year, which included a hit in his first career at-bat when he singled off of the Twins\' (and for a short-time an Oriole) Liam Hendriks.    2013 saw him spend the majority of the season with the Royals. It was a campaign in which he hit .286 with 17 doubles. His glove was superb. For that season, FanGraphs gave him a zone rating of 14.5. As a 27 year old rookie, he didn\'t receive much hype but\xc2\xa0did come in eighth place for the American League Rookie of the Year voting.

The offense was what fans expected, the defense was spectacular and the pitching was effective.Chris Davis had what may have been his game to get him out of his early season struggles. Davis hit three bombs to right center field, helping single-handedly lead the O\xe2\x80\x99s to victory.Nelson Cruz also had a solo HR in the game, going back-to-back in the fifth inning with Davis off Liriano.In fact, every starter had a hit except Caleb Joseph, who drew a bases loaded walk to give the Orioles the lead in the third. And Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s defense was more than enough to make up for not having a hit.Davis also helped turn several double plays, including a filthy one where Manny Machado laid out, quickly flipped to Jonathan Schoop and then Schoop one-hopped the throw to Davis, who scooped it out of the dirt. It was fabulous.Speaking of defense, Schoop also had a leaping catch that was quite good. Miguel Gonzalez fielded his position well on Tuesday night. But the best defensive play was by Caleb Joseph.The play by Joseph was in the first few innings, with Pirates on the corners and threatening. Miguel Gonzalez was struggling with his command, and threw a ball that bounced and was headed toward the outside of the opposite batter\xe2\x80\x99s box. Joseph somehow stopped the ball and saved a run.Miguel Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s pitching was also very good in this game. Miguel had 7 strikeouts, had several shutdown innings after the Orioles scored.The BAD: The bullpen was the only blemish in this game. Tommy Hunter came in and left up two singles before getting a double play. Zach Britton also struggled a bit before he got a double play.Those double plays helped get the bullpen out of some hairy situations, although the Orioles had a sizeable lead at that point.Overall, not a lot of bad coming out of this game, something that will make Orioles fans, players and coaches smile!What\xe2\x80\x99s NEXT: Weather permitting, the Orioles are supposed to be back at PNC Park on Wednesday at 7:05 p.m.Chris Tillman (4-2, 3.54) will face Wandy Rodriguez (0-2, 6.84).

For the record, it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily baseball people \xe2\x80\x93 as in league executives \xe2\x80\x93 that are saying that should happen. It\xe2\x80\x99s generally fans and in some cases writers.But this is going to sound a bit different from the normal DH discussion. Count me as a writer who\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0against the designated hitter. MiguelCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsGonzalez went 0-for-3 at the plate last night, however one thing that some people don\xe2\x80\x99t know is that Buck Showalter only has his pitchers practice their bunting for the most part. (Some guys do take some swings in the cage here and there, but their \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d BP is just bunting.)  Oriole pitchers only practice bunting during BP.  That in and of itself would be an argument in favor\xc2\xa0of the DH, in that having a pitcher swing the lumber takes away from the offensive element of the game.But baseball isn\xe2\x80\x99t an offensive game, or a defensive game for that matter. Part of the charm of the sport has always been that it\xe2\x80\x99s a thinking man\xe2\x80\x99s game. The best hitters, pitchers, coaches, etc. are also great thinkers. It\xe2\x80\x99s a game of strategy, and sometimes one of chess. Thus it would stand to reason that American League pitchers, who aren\xe2\x80\x99t as used to hitting as their National League counterparts, would only practice bunting. A ground ball in the infield could start a double play and run the team right out of the inning. So while some would argue that having pitchers almost exclusively bunt is a waste, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually strategic.But perhaps more importantly, the last time I checked pitchers were part of the nine on the field. The question posed should be why\xc2\xa0shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pitchers have to hit? Occasionally we hear pitchers complain about run support; that pitcher would bear some accountability for that if he had to hit.Speaking for myself, it would be tragic if pitchers league-wide didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to swing the lumber. It boils down to the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s a part of the game. Under National League rules, managers have to be much more strategic and think a bit harder when it comes to when to lift a pitcher and so forth. Why should American League managers not have to do the same? Granted, most pitchers aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best hitters in the world. But is that due to the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re pitchers or that they\xe2\x80\x99re in theory only hitting once a week or so?Go figure, on occasion we\xe2\x80\x99ve even seen pitchers that were darned good hitters. Recently, Carlos Zambrano and Dontrelle Willis could hit pretty well. He was a career .238 hitter that actually hit 24 home runs over the course of his career. In fact, his average probably would have been even better had managers not decided to send him up as a pinch hitter from time to time \xe2\x80\x93 he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the greatest pinch hitter in the world. (To compare, Oriole legend Mark Belanger retired with a career .228 average.) The Washington Nationals would also use Livan Hernandez as a pinch hitter from time to time.I understand why teams don\xe2\x80\x99t generally use their pitchers in pinch-hitting roles, however that opens up another point of discussion; what if a team runs out of bench players? Remember in 2012 when the Orioles played a 17 and 18-inning game? Everyone remembers Chris Davis pitching, but what if the inverse had occurred? Let\xe2\x80\x99s say a field player gets injured or ejected, and the team has nobody left on the bench. That should never happen, because there are four other (starting) pitchers on the bench that should be fresh. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be a luxury to be able to summon a starting pitcher to the plate and know that he has a chance at coming through?This is all well and good, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the AL ever getting rid of the designated hitter. In fact, I suspect that at some point the NL\xc2\xa0will adopt it, meaning that we\xe2\x80\x99ll never see pitchers at the plate. But to my real point here, if a player (pitcher or otherwise) is on the 25-man roster he should be able to hit. That\xe2\x80\x99s part of baseball.

Steve Pearce's first stint with the Orioles this year reflected the fact that he seemed redundant on the roster, one of three right-handed corner outfield bats (along with Delmon Young and Nelson Cruz).\xc2\xa0 Before he was temporarily cut from the team, he had all of seven plate appearances.\xc2\xa0 But shortly after Pearce was cut, Chris Davis hit the DL with an oblique injury, and the Orioles, lacking another natural first baseman, hastily re-signed him.\xc2\xa0 And a funny thing happened: Steve Pearce hit. In 45 PAs since Davis hit the DL (yes, yes, small sample size), Pearce went .293/.356/.561 with 3 HRs.\xc2\xa0 He stole the spotlight in a few games.\xc2\xa0 He played solid (if unspectacular) defense at first base.\xc2\xa0 And then Chris Davis came back on May 11th, and Pearce has gotten all of six PAs since. Delmon Young seems to be taking up the right-handed spot starts at DH or LF, and while his season numbers look OK, he's slashing just .240/.240/.240 in May.\xc2\xa0 This seems like the exact opposite of riding the hot hand, which is what you'd want and expect a team that's flirting with contention and in possession of some fungible roster spots to do.    The complete disappearance of Pearce also coincides with a period of rough offense from the Orioles, with top producers like Adam Jones and Chris Davis scuffling a bit, and Matt Wieters on the DL.\xc2\xa0 Why, finding themselves in that situation, would the Orioles not make space for a bat that was red-hot -- particularly against left-handed pitching, against which Pearce rakes (.265/.349/.458 in his career) and several Orioles regulars (Davis, Markakis), in the exact positions Pearce can cover, frequently struggle? Don't get me wrong - I don't think Steve Pearce is some magic bullet, nor is he a long-term fix, nor should he be considered any kind of part of the Orioles core.\xc2\xa0 I'm talking about tactics here, not strategy.\xc2\xa0 It's bizarre for the Orioles to let a hot bat languish, particularly when platoon splits would call for him to at least be making spot starts.\xc2\xa0 This mismanagement of hitting resources seems like part of a larger roster management problem that the team is having this year, much like the bizarre deployment of bad relievers (Evan Meek) in high-leverage situations, the decision to call up Kevin Gausman on three days' rest with just one start under his belt after catching pneumonia, or the constant attempts to stretch Wei-Yin Chen and Miguel Gonzalez into late innings after they start to elevate pitches. It's time for the Orioles to get Pearce into the lineup against lefties.\xc2\xa0 Give Davis a day of rest here and there - he was just on the DL, after all - or cede the platoon DH role to Pearce instead of Young.\xc2\xa0 Putting Pearce into full-blown disappearing act mode again is unjustifiable at this particular point in time.

""We didn\'t have a really good road trip. To start off this homestand and go 0-2 it wouldn\'t have been pretty. That\'s huge for me.""Andrew McCutchen went 3 for 4 with an RBI and his first two extra-base hits in more than two weeks for Pittsburgh, which won for only the third time in its past nine games. Marte and Ike Davis had three hits and two RBIs apiece for the Pirates.Bryan Morris (4-0) earned the victory after allowing the Orioles to tie the game in the top of the seventh.No biggie.Mark Melancon worked a perfect ninth for his seventh save, one that capped a weird night in which the teams combined for 14 runs in the first two innings while starters Wandy Rodriguez and Chris Tillman took turns getting hit hard.It ended in more orderly fashion after Marte led off the seventh with a bunt single, moved to third on a single by Davis and scored when Sanchez laced a Webb offering into right field.""It\'s a game-winning hit, he\'s got a few of them,"" Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said of Sanchez. ""He\'s got extreme confidence.""Nelson Cruz hit his 14th homer of the season and drove in three runs for the Orioles. Nick Markakis, Chris Davis and JJ Hardy had two hits and one RBI apiece but Baltimore left 10 men on base.""You had two early exits from starters and it became a game out of the bullpen and they pushed one across there late,"" Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. ""But our guys, we had a couple opportunities to score some more, but I can\'t fault the offense.""Pittsburgh began the night eight games under .500 in part because of a struggling starting staff that has hardly looked like the group that led the team to the postseason last fall.Things didn\'t get much better, but the bullpen briefly recaptured its touch.Vin Mazzaro\'s worked 3 1-3 innings of hitless relief to steady things after Rodriguez made a mess of things during 1 2-3 poor innings.The veteran left-hander has struggled with his command and his conviction all season and did little to convince Hurdle he was ready to turn the corner despite being spotted a 4-0 first-inning lead thanks in part to a two-run triple by Marte.The 35-year-old Rodriguez, in the final year of his contract, promptly gave the big lead away as Cruz led off the second a blistering solo home run and added a two-run double later in the inning to put the Orioles in front.Rodriguez\'s throwing error on a sacrifice bunt attempt by Tillman meant he was only charged with one earned run for his 1 2-3 innings of work, dropping his ERA from 6.84 to 6.75.Hurdle said it was too early to discuss whether Rodriguez would make his next start, though Rodriguez insists he\'s healthy after missing time early this season with a left knee injury.Tillman couldn\'t take advantage of the reprieve. Coming off a shutout win over Kansas City in his previous start, Tillman only managed to get three outs.He failed to retire a batter in the second as the first six Pittsburgh batters reached base. Brad Brach came on in relief to get out of the inning, but not until after the Orioles trailed 8-6.NOTES: Pirates closer Jason Grilli could return as early as Saturday.

05/22/2014,"[(""Baltimore Orioles' Pitching Compliments Offense When ..."", 'Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are no different from any other MLB team when it comes to winning games when scoring at least four runs.I have been digging into the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 seasons since 2011 to understand this stat when it comes to Baltimore.Through the first month and a half, the Orioles are playing very similar to their 2012 season, also known as the playoff season.Underneath all of the numbers, the Orioles season come down to the same things, and the small differences show the results of each season.In regards to scoring four runs, the Orioles were 58-39 for a .597 winning percentage in 2011. When removing failed comebacks which resulted in the Orioles scoring four runs, their record was 58-24 with a .707 winning percentage.Within the 58 wins, 35 wins came when the opponents scored less than four times. The other 23 wins came when the opponents scored four or more times.A key factor in that season was a 23-39 record when the Orioles scored four or more runs and allowed four or more runs. Even when removing failed comebacks, the Orioles still had a losing record.In 2012, the Orioles won 93 games and 72 of those games the offense scored four or more runs. Their overall record when scoring at least four runs was 72-17 for a .809 winning percentage.Analyzing each loss, eight of those games the Orioles scored four runs in a failed comeback. A 72-9 record is left with a .889 winning percentage.The Orioles scored four or more runs 46 times, while the pitching held the opponents to less than four runs. 26 times the opposing team scored four or more runs.The Orioles were 26-9 (excluding failed comebacks) in 2012 when both teams scored four or more runs.In contrast to the 2011 season, the Orioles pitching complemented the offense. The pitching was better compared to previous years giving the Orioles 21 wins when the offense scored less than four runs.A similar trend could be seen in the 2013 season, but with some differences.The Orioles, again like all MLB teams do, won 69 of 85 games when scoring four or more runs. However, that season the pitching was not as good as in 2012, so the Orioles lost 31 times when scoring four or more times.The Orioles won 24 times when they scored four or more, giving them a .436 winning percentage in that scenario. When accounting for failed comebacks, which often distort this stat, the winning percentage raises only to .558%.The overall record dropped from 2012 to .690 winning percentage when scoring four or more runs, or .784% when removing the distortion from the stats.The pitching\xe2\x80\x99s poor performance showed when both teams scored less than four runs, which stood at 16-14 for a .533 winning percentage.With all those stats of the recent seasons, the only stats that matter are the ones for this 2014 season.Through the first month and a half of the season, the Orioles are on the same track record of the last two seasons.The offense has currently scored four or more runs in 21 games, winning 15. Four of the six losses only come into this stat because of failed comebacks.The Orioles have lost two times when the offense has kept the game in reach. The pitching was just bad enough for good offense to be unable to overcome.In my analysis of the past three seasons and this current season, I put the blame on the offense, and not as much on the pitching.Before a revolt breaks out at this blasphemy, there is reasoning behind this madness. The Orioles offense has been good with the massive onslaught of home runs last season, and a powerhouse of a lineup.I take this from the record the Orioles have when both teams score four or more runs. The pitching keeps the Orioles in the games, but the offense leaves them hanging, which leads to a loss.The pitching is to blame for some games, such as Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 9-8 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates.However, this season, the offense has not been consistent to provide a complementary aspect to the pitching.When offense scores the magic number of four, the pitching complements it with a good outing, or keeps the Orioles in the game, most of the time. This has been true for the most part over the past two winning seasons.The Orioles have never been a great pitching team, and now that there has been an improvement, it is time for the offense to step up.If the offense can be a bit more consistent, the Orioles are going to start push away from the .500 mark, and become a better team.The lineup has the players to do it, but the consistency has not shown up yet this season. I am still waiting for the Orioles to take advantage of their magic number of four.

Last evening it was egregious \xe2\x80\x93 done with one out in sending that speedster J.J. Hardy home. Multiple other times this season there have been overly-cautious holds with two outs.

The Orioles have several proven major league hitters on their bench, but with the position players relatively healthy at the moment, Showalter has struggled to find them consistent playing time. Too many quality players is a good problem to have, but major league hitters need at-bats to keep their timing and be productive when called upon.Although he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shown anything at the plate this season, Ryan Flaherty has shown flashes of above-average power over the previous two seasons. However, with the immergence of Jonathan Schoop, Flaherty has only seen action in five games this month. Part of his absence is probably a result of his lack of production so far this season, but significant time between ABs isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to help his swing when he has to play. If the Orioles want to keep him on the active roster, they are going to have to find him at least some ABs.Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s greatest asset is that he can play virtually every position. As the Orioles have seen thus far this season, J.J. Hardy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the power-hitter they had seen in the past. Coming off an April where he was hampered by nagging injuries, the 31 year old slugger may benefit from more frequent off days. Giving Flaherty some starts at short could keep Hardy fresh in August and September.The most difficult issue on the bench may be Delmon Young and Steve Pearce. Both have shown the ability to hit at the major league level in the past and both were productive early in the season. However, the issue in finding them playing time is their similarities. Both get the majority of playing time against lefties and both play similar positions. However, the advantage would have to go to Pearce because he can play first base as well as the corner outfield positions.As Orioles fans saw in Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 absence, Pearce can be a productive hitter when given the opportunity. Although it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to sit some of our best hitters, guys like Davis and Markakis could also benefit from more frequent off days. The Orioles could even start Pearce in left, slide David Lough to center and allow Adam Jones an off day. The Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t losing too much at the plate with Pearce, and it would keep him sharp and others rested as the season goes on.Delmon Young may be the odd man out. Young hit over .300 for the Orioles in April, however he has only 10 Abs since May 7th. With the way the roster is right now, the Orioles may\xc2\xa0gain more from a player like Jemile Weeks or Steve Lombardozzi in that final roster spot. However, if the Orioles choose to go in that direction, they would probably lose Young to another team.The Orioles had five players play more than 150 games last year, more than any other team. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say if that contributed to the less than stellar September, but one could argue other teams may have had fresher legs down the stretch. With quality talent behind them, the Orioles should consider doing more to keep their stars rested for a stretch run. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
05/23/2014,"[(""Orioles and Indians play sloppiest game in history, O's ..."", "" The Orioles and Indians engaged in a back-and-forth game tonight that can only be described as ridiculous. Both teams had plenty of chances to score, both teams had multiple misplays in the field. No matter which team had won, the other team would have left the field feeling like garbage. In this case, the garbage team was the Orioles. If you take a glance at Wei-Yin Chen's pitching line (6 2/3, 8 H, 5 R, 0 BB, 1 K, 1 HR), you would probably think he pitched worse than he did. He did get into some trouble in the second and third innings, giving up a solo home run to Ryan Raburn and then allowing two more to come in on a single, a triple, and a wild pitch. But then he buttoned down and went into the seventh inning looking good. The Orioles had gotten him a two-run lead by that time. He gave up a one-out single, then 2B Ryan Flaherty botched not one, but two double play balls to keep the inning going. It pushed Chen into his danger zone pitch count, and he gave up a two-run single. Shame. Chen deserved better tonight. Justin Masterson was good for the first four innings of the game tonight, even though it was so long ago that I barely remember it. But he started the fifth inning by walking Steve Clevenger on four pitches and then hitting J.J. Hardy and Ryan Flaherty. That brought David Lough to the plate, who grounded into a 1-2-3 double play. Seriously. Masterson wasn't so lucky in the next inning, when he gave up a double, a walk, and two singles that resulted in two Orioles runs. He then, embarrassingly, gave up a three-run home run to Ryan Flaherty, temporarily giving the Orioles a two-run lead. Masterson was pulled from the game after walking David Lough.    We didn't even have time to bask in the glory of Flaherty's Earl Weaver Special before he was making us hate him via the shenanigans mentioned above. First he stepped directly in front of Hardy, who was about to field an easy ground ball for a double play, and then he dropped a ground ball right to him that would have been another double play. Brian Matusz had to replace Chen at that point, and after giving up a single, Asdrubal Cabrera hit a fly ball that looked for sure like a three-run homer. But David Lough proved that he does have some worth after all, with a\xc2\xa0fantastic catch to end the inning.    The Indians wanted to get in on the shenanigans, and made two fielding errors in the bottom of the seventh inning to set up a go-ahead sac fly by Nelson Cruz. That lead lasted about five seconds, because Darren O'Day gave up a home run in the 8th to Lonnie Chisenhall. No more runs were scored until the 13th inning, thanks in part to more Orioles shenanigans. These shenanigans included Flaherty striking out because he bunted with two strikes and it went foul, and Steve Clevenger bunting to move Nelson Cruz over, only to have Cruz thrown out at second.    Preston Guilmet pitched 2 1/3 great innings, and if the Orioles had won this game he would have been a prime candidate for MBP. But eventually he had to give way to someone, and that someone was Troy Patton. Here is a quick summary of what Patton did:  Here is what he actually did:  Pitching Change: Troy Patton replaces Preston Guilmet.  2.Michael Brantley singles on a soft line drive to center fielder Adam Jones.  3.Lonnie Chisenhall singles on a bunt line drive to second baseman Jonathan Schoop. Michael Brantley to 2nd.  4.Nick Swisher walks. Michael Brantley to 3rd. Lonnie Chisenhall to 2nd.

Lonnie Chisenhall scores. Nick Swisher to 3rd.  7.David Murphy walks.  8.Mike Aviles grounds into a force out, third baseman Ryan Flaherty to second baseman Jonathan Schoop. David Murphy out at 2nd.  The Orioles may have to get rid of a relief pitcher to have someone fresh tomorrow. It will probably be Preston Guilmet, but I pretty much hope that it's Troy Patton. Nick Markakis, after watching strike three in the bottom of the 10th and leaving five men on base over the course of the game, decided it was time for an FUHR in the bottom of the 13th. Some might say that it's not an FUHR in a two-run game, but trust me, it was.    Oh, and on top of it all, Manny Machado came out of the game with a groin injury.

It was more of a stiffness every time I started running, or that first step. And it just kept getting worse.""Showalter noticed that Machado appeared uncomfortable, asked him about it and promptly removed him from the game.""I thought it would be good to exercise a little caution there and see where we are (Friday),"" Showalter said. ""Sometimes, especially with young players, you just want to take it out of their hands.""Machado held out hope that he could return before the weekend.""See how it feels (Friday) and hopefully get back in the lineup,"" he said.After two hits and a walk loaded the bases in the 13th, Carlos Santana came to the plate against Troy Patton (0-1) with a .148 batting average. He pulled a sharp grounder inside the third-base line for a two-run double, only his third hit in 32 at-bats with two outs and runners on.Josh Outman (4-0) pitched two scoreless innings and Scott Atchison got three outs for his first save, despite giving up a solo home run to Nick Markakis.Ryan Flaherty also homered for Baltimore and Adam Jones had three hits.Baltimore used a five-run sixth inning to erase a 3-0 deficit, and after the Indians pulled even in the seventh the Orioles scored the go-ahead run in the bottom half without benefit of a hit.Shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera fumbled Machado\'s sharp grounder and Jones followed with a bouncer to third. Santana threw wildly to second base trying to start a double play, leaving runners on second and third with one out. After Mark Lowe issued an intentional walk to Chris Davis, Nelson Cruz hit a sacrifice fly to make it 6-5.Lonnie Chisenhall answered in the eighth with a pinch-hit homer off Darren O\'Day to make it 6-all. It was Chisenhall\'s second home run of the season, both in the past two games.Much earlier, Indians starter Justin Masterson induced three double plays over the first five innings while being pressed into action on three days\' rest.In the Baltimore sixth, after Steve Clevenger and J.J. Hardy delivered two-out RBI singles, Flaherty hit a 2-1 pitch over the 25-foot scoreboard in right field to make it 5-3.The advantage vanished in the seventh. With one out, Flaherty fumbled a potential double play grounder to second base, getting an out at first that resulted in an RBI for David Murphy.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles doubled-up on the Cleveland Indians with twice as many runs (8-4), twice as many hits (14-7) and twice as many home runs (2-1) Friday night.Orioles starter Bud Norris improved his record to 3-4 with six workmanlike innings, giving up four runs on six hits. Those four runs were all scored in the fourth inning, with three of them on a homer by Jason Giambi (He of the .125 batting average). But that was all the scoring the Indians would muster on this evening.The Baltimore Orioles offense seems to be finally awakening. Chris Davis hit the big blow with a two-run homer in the fifth inning that would give the Birds a 5-4 lead that they would not surrender. Davis had earlier doubled in two runs in the second inning for a total of four on the evening. Nick Markakis hammered out four hits to raise his average to .306, and Adam Jones had another multi-hit game with three.As has been stated in this blog and by many other Orioles writers, when the big guns in this offense are working, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are going to win a lot of games. The 1-3-4-5 spots in the order were a combined 10-for-15.Continuing to especially empower the Orioles attack was Nelson Cruz who opened the scoring with his 15th homer and 43rd RBI in the second inning. Cruz is on pace at this moment to hit 53 homers and drive in 151 runs. Anyone want to bet if he will get paid more than $8-million next year?Ryan Flaherty filled in at third base for the hopefully only slightly-injured Manny Machado, who will presumably return on Saturday afternoon.Certainly also returning to the lineup will be Steve Clevenger behind the plate, as the Orioles will be facing a decent right-hander in the Indians\xe2\x80\x99 Corey Kluber \xe2\x80\x93 4-3 with a 3.43 ERA over 10 starts this season.Kluber has pitched once against the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 starting and losing a game on June 27th of last season. He gave up seven runs on 11 hits in 4.1 innings. Matt Wieters and Flaherty had two hits each, with Wieters and Davis hitting doubles. So we might see Flaherty in the game at second base, even if Machado indeed returns.The Orioles will send Ubaldo Jimenez to the mound for his fifth start in May. After his wretched month of April, it seemed through the first three games of May that the old lights-out Ubaldo had arrived with the warmer weather. But then he gave up five runs on eight hits in five innings in Kansas City last Sunday.Since prior to this season Jimenez pitched in the National League for the Rockies and then for Cleveland, he has never actually pitched against the Indians.So it looks like a wide open sort of anything-can-happen kind of game on tap for Saturday afternoon.

And if you missed it, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll spare you the worst of it.For example, after the Orioles came back from a 3-0 deficit to take a 5-3 lead, it was immediately given back with lousy defense. Then, Lonnie Chisenhall broke that tie to put the Indians ahead with a homer over the right field wall off Darren O\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2Day. Later, with the game tied in the 13th, the same Chisehall set up the inning with a bunt single over the head of a charging Chris Davis. Yes, you read that correctly. It was that kind of game.I want to be annoyed with Ryan Flaherty for misplaying two consecutive balls and costing Chen and the Orioles two runs (and probably the game), but Flash hit a three-run homer to give them the lead that he gave back before the inning was over.And I want to be annoyed with David Lough for grounding into a 1-2-3 double play with the bases loaded and none out, but Lough would save the Orioles three runs with a great catch at the wall.Though the Orioles got great pitching from Zach Britton and Preston Guilmet, it was the totally lost hangers by Patton that killed them, along with Flaherty\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s muffs. I said it before; it is time for fresh air in another place for Patton. And it is difficult to imagine how Delmon Young could not stumble into far better production than comes from Lough \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c who has been a huge disappointment.More good news \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Manny Machado was taken out with some sort of groin aggravation.

The Indians defeated the Orioles 9-0. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are an average to slightly-above-average baseball team. As currently constructed and particularly as currently playing, this is a painful truth. And what is their record for the season? 24-23. Yep.There are a lot of explanations and justifications for this, most of which are legitimate; but they don\xe2\x80\x99t change the reality of the opening statement above.But the deal is this: the hopes were that the 2014 Baltimore Orioles could be a lot better than average and would be good enough to compete at the highest levels. And that is still possible in this season of quantum change in the AL East where TORONTO IS IN FIRST PLACE!It is all very, very weird.And the weirdness continued on Saturday afternoon with a 9-0 loss to the Cleveland Indians. Though the Orioles tallied eight base hits, they were sufficiently scattered to never really be a threat to score and get back into the game.Ubaldo Jimenez had another very poor outing. Though he held the Indians off the scoreboard for the first four innings, he had the characteristic elevated pitch count again, eventually giving up five walks. He was unable to get a single out in the fifth inning, as five consecutive batters reached base. Reliever T.J. McFarland was no better on this day, as two more reached and the Indians tallied five in that fifth inning. All those runs would be charged to the account of Jimenez, while four more Cleveland runs in the seventh inning would be credited to McFarland.So What Is The Problem?It is not a simple answer or a single issue. We could sum in up with three \xe2\x80\x9cins\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa61. InjuriesThough the Baltimore Orioles are far from alone in this category, they have indeed been affected negatively by the loss of a number of key players.We knew that Manny Machado would not really be replaced until he returned, and though he has brought back with him the great defense, not surprisingly his hitting and timing has been inconsistent at best.It has often been speculated as to what the cost in performance of the team would be if the Orioles did not have Matt Wieters. We may be finding that out right now, and we may be finding it out for a long time to come if this situation turns into a Tommy John surgery. Though Steve Clevenger and Caleb Joseph have provided very solid catching, their offensive production seriously pales in comparison to the wonderful start on the season that Wieters had put together at the plate. It is a shame that this injury has come at such a time.Chris Davis had his turn on the DL, though he looks to be returning to better form. J.J. Hardy avoided the DL, though he missed a good bit of time earlier in the year. And now Tommy Hunter is on the list.Again, everybody deals with this, though it was thought that the Baltimore Orioles had more depth built into the system to deal with this better than has been the reality. It is one thing to have Ryan Flaherty, Jonathan Schoop, and Clevenger or Joseph in the eighth and ninth holes with a performing lineup one through seven; but when too many pieces are missing or underperforming, the order loses a lot of its teeth.2. Inconsistent PlayIt has so often seemed that when the Orioles hit will, the pitching struggles; or just about the time the Birds get a one-run, seven-inning start, the offense puts up nothing. The Orioles actually have the second highest batting average in the American League, along with the third most hits. Their pitching statistics are also, in the big picture of things, right around the league average. For example, they have given up 4.30 runs-per-game, whereas the AL average is 4.33.One would expect a bit better overall record given the paragraph above, though again, the pitching and hitting has not been in concert on so many occasions.Also, there is the issue of the home/away record. They are 10-12 at home and 14-11 on the road. When have we ever seen this sort of disparity with the Orioles?3. Insufficient PerformanceWe don\xe2\x80\x99t need to look much beyond today to see insufficiency in performance. Ubaldo Jimenez has so far this season evidenced the validity of the reticence of the Orioles management to give large free agent contracts to pitchers. A record of 2-6 and 4.98 ERA is not what the Birds thought they were buying.David Lough has been a bust in left field, especially after looking so good in spring training. I cannot understand this, as there was every reason to believe he would really thrive in Baltimore.Also, the second base and utility infield production has not been what was anticipated and hoped for coming out of the spring.And everyone knew the starting pitching was somewhat likely to struggle with getting deep into games. This has been a mixed bag of performance, and just when it has seemed that perhaps a corner has been turned on this, we have the recent outings of Jimenez today and Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s recent one-inning start.Adam Jones has truly come alive at bat, Nick Markakis has answered many critics with his .300 average, and where would the Orioles be without Nelson Cruz? But this has not been enough.So, all in all, the bad news is that the Orioles are only a game over .500 at this point, though the good news is that the Blue Jays are the only team ahead of them, the Yankees have had an equal struggle, and the Red Sox and Rays are dredging the basement. It is not a lost cause, but this squad with all its talent needs to be better than slightly above average.

05/25/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: These games happen - Birds Watcher', 'Cleveland was obviously much more easily adaptable to the quick turnaround yesterday (early day game\xc2\xa0under the blonde sun\xc2\xa0after a night game) than were the Baltimore Orioles. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say why teams can look so good in a game, only to come back the next day and lay an egg. However it probably begins and ends with starting pitching, and Ubaldo Jimenez was unable to get out of the fifth inning yesterday. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4 IP, 4 H, 5 R, 5 BB, 3 K. Jimenez was strong for four innings, although he did allow a few runners. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t break until the fifth when his pitch count was creeping up.Cleveland put runners at first and second\xc2\xa0with nobody out in the fifth, and when JonathanCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsSchoop bobbled Sellers\xe2\x80\x99 infield single and allowed a run to score. Cleveland would proceed to load the bases, and then took a 2-0 lead on Aviles\xe2\x80\x99 RBI-single. A HBP, an RBI-single, and a GIDP later, and the Orioles trailed 4-0 with only two outs. Buck Showalter went to T.J. McFarland after Cleveland netted their second run due to Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s high pitch count, however the final two runs were charged to Jimenez as he was responsible for the runners.Raburn\xe2\x80\x99s two-RBI single gave Cleveland a 7-0 lead in the seventh, and to top things off Carlos Santana hit a pop fly to right that just carroed\xe2\x80\xa6and carried, and carried. It hit off the roof of the grounds crew shed and bounced into the stands\xe2\x80\xa6for a two-run homer. You know that it\xe2\x80\x99s not your day when your opponents are using the dimensions of\xc2\xa0your\xc2\xa0home park to their advantage. However let\xe2\x80\x99s not pin this entirely on Ubaldo Jimenez or the pitching staff. The O\xe2\x80\x99s couldn\xe2\x80\x99t muster any runs off of eight hits.Part of this was due to Corey Kluber\xe2\x80\x98s mastery on the mound.  Many people will question whether Kluber was good on this day, or if the Orioles were just impatient. Either way, he dominated a very potent lineup.  When the O\xe2\x80\x99s did get on base, they were unable to move runners over, or even go station-to-station. Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to explain how the O\xe2\x80\x99s can look so good one day and so off the next. But that\xe2\x80\x99s baseball. Lonnie Chisenhall has also killed Oriole pitching this series, going 2-for-5 with an RBI in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game.For the most part, these four-game series\xe2\x80\x99 end up getting split, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s have a shot at doing that today. Unfortunately they\xe2\x80\x99ll face Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s Trevor Bauer in the finale this afternoon, along with his 2.25 ERA on the season. However the Orioles also pulled quite a few of their starters in the later innings yesterday so as to give them some extra rest with the game out of hand. The Birds will send Miguel Gonzalez to the mound against Cleveland this afternoon.The big news of the day however was that the Orioles announced right as the game was beginning that they had made a trade. Troy Patton was sent to the San Diego Padres (along with cash) in exchange for catcher Nick Hundley. Hundley has had some injury problems over time, however he\xe2\x80\x99s a veteran catcher that handles pitching staffs well. Thus far in 2014, Hundley has been hitting .271 with a homer and three RBI for San Diego. He\xe2\x80\x99s making $4 million this year, and his contract includes a $5 million team option for 2015.This move calls to question what Oriole batteries will look like moving forward this year. This is just my personal opinion, however I suspect that Matt Wieters might not return in 2014. While Wieters still maintains that he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to rejoin the team later in the summer, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the Orioles would make a move like this only to have Wieters come back into the mix. Nevertheless, Caleb Joseph will probably be optioned back to the minor leagues so as to make room for Hundley at some point. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether he\xe2\x80\x99ll actually be in Baltimore for today\xe2\x80\x99s game, or if he\xe2\x80\x99ll join the team in Milwaukee on Monday.As for Troy Patton, he was aquired in a 2007 trade that sent Miguel Tejada to Houston. The Orioles more than got their money\xe2\x80\x99s worth out of him in that sense. Perhaps one of the most important but yet unspoken aspects of this trade from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint is that they\xe2\x80\x99re removing a player from the organization that\xe2\x80\x99s out of options. The bullpen has been a crowded place for some time, and Patton has almost been one of the \xe2\x80\x9cuntouchables\xe2\x80\x9d given that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t send him down without him clearing waivers. That would risk them losing him \xe2\x80\x93 and continuing to pay his salary.So it\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see what roster moves are made in the time between now and this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game given that things seem to be moving fairly\xc2\xa0quickly. Hundley is expected to be\xc2\xa0on the active roster in time for today\xe2\x80\x99s game.

Hardy (right) in the dugout before playing the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park. Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY SportsBaseball is an often unpredictable game. While the Orioles are hovering around .500 and remain in contention for the playoffs as many expected, the way they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been exactly as planned. Below are some of the most surprising things about the team up to this point in the season.J.J. Hardy is homerless.J.J. Hardy has hit more home runs over the last three seasons than other other shortstop in MLB besides Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s Troy Tulowitzki. This season however, Hardy has not gone deep once in 149 ABs. Hardy dealt with an injured hamstring in late April, but has steadily raised his average to the current .295 since his return. Despite the ability to make solid contact returning, Hardy still has been mysteriously zapped of his power, frustrating Orioles fans and fantasy baseball owners everywhere.Matt Wieters is injured.For the first time in his career, Orioles catcher Matt Wieters is seeing significant time on the disabled list as a result of a sore elbow. If it requires surgery, Wieters could be sidelined for at least the remainder of the 2014 season. The injury is completely new territory for Wieters, who played in more games last year than any other catcher that did not also play elsewhere in the field. Wieters appeared in 148 games in 2013, with only San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Buster Posey and Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Carlos Santana the only other catchers who played more.Nelson Cruz is on pace with 2013 Chris Davis.Actually, Cruz is exceeding Davis\xe2\x80\x99 pace, as his 15 home runs are one more than Davis had at this point last year. Cruz has been the most valuable addition for the 2014 Orioles and maybe the best acquisition of the entire offseason. It still boggles my mind to think the Orioles are only paying $8 million for this one-year performance. If Cruz keeps up this pace and remains healthy this season, he may be due for a $12 million raise \xe2\x80\x94 although it probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be from the Orioles.Zach Britton has a 0.7 ERA.Zach Britton has unquestionably been the best reliever in the Oriole bullpen. The recently installed closer has stabilized the shaky ninth inning duties that once belonged to Tommy Hunter and seems to have finally found his niche in the major leagues. Entering this season, it seemed the only reason Britton was guaranteed a roster spot was that he was out of minor league options. Since his inclusion, he has proven to be the most reliable piece in the pen and has gone the same failed starter to successful closer route as Hunter and Brian Matusz.Ryan Flaherty is not the starting second baseman.Many expected Ryan Flaherty to start at second base this year after manager Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s high praise of him throughout the spring. But, just as he did last year, Flaherty started slow and played his way into a utility role. That will be where Flaherty stays, as the Orioles now have three other more favorable second base options in Jemile Weeks, Jonathan Schoop, and Steve Lombardozzi.The Blue Jays are in first place and the Rays and Red Sox are struggling.Going into today\xe2\x80\x99s games, the Orioles find themselves in a position they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been in for some time. Baltimore is looking up at the Toronto Blue Jays and down at both the Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays in the AL East standings. Coming off of a five-game winning streak, the Blue Jays have emerged as a surprise contender for the division crown and a challenger to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bid for a playoff spot. Meanwhile, the Rays and Red Sox have had injuries that played a major role in temporarily anchoring them to the bottom of the division.\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles celebrate birth of baby Davis with 4-2 victory ...', ' Most days, Steve Pearce hangs out on the end of the bench for the Orioles. You sometimes have to wonder if Buck even remembers he is on the team as he stays on the bench behind someone like Delmon Young. Then he gets his chances, like on Sunday, with Chris Davis missing the game to be with his wife as she has their first child. Pearce made the most of his chance, turning in a 3-4 day as the Orioles beat the Indians 4-2, salvaging a split in the series. The game did not begin with such glory looking apparent. The top of the first inning looked like some kind of continuation of yesterday afternoon\'s mess. Orioles starter Miguel Gonzalez allowed the first three batters of the game to reach without recording an out, and you had to worry if he was about to turn in a dud outing one day after an ugly 9-0 shutout. Runs scored on two consecutive sacrifice flies, one by Lonnie Chisenhall and one by the Governor of Brohio, Nick Swisher. The Indians took a 2-0 lead and did not score for the rest of the game. The O\'s hitters faced off against Indians starter Trevor Bauer, the one-time Diamondbacks prospect who was traded because he wasn\'t Diamondbacks enough for them or whatever. In the MASN broadcast booth, Gary Thorne and Jim Palmer addressed this briefly. Apparently, Bauer is an introvert and rubbed the organization the wrong way. ""There\'s nothing wrong with being an introvert,"" Gary intoned, ""but there is something wrong with being a robot."" Palmer chimed in, ""Unless it\'s cleaning your floor while you\'re away."" Thanks for clearing that up, guys.    As for the actual person Bauer who was on the mound today, he showed flashes of good stuff, striking out eight Orioles batters, but he missed enough that they caught up to him for four runs on six hits in 4.1 innings.    Pearce led off the bottom of the second inning with a single, the first O\'s hit of the game. He stole second as J.J. Hardy struck out. Pearce stealing bases, why not? The stolen base proved important when he scored on a Jonathan Schoop single to put the O\'s on the board. It was Pearce who helped the Orioles pull the score to a 2-2 tie. Nelson Cruz stood on second after a two-out double and Pearce grounded a single into shallow right. The windmill that is Bobby Dickerson never wavered in sending Cruz on the play. He should have been out by a mile, and would have been if Indians catcher Carlos Santana\'s swipe tag into Cruz\'s chest didn\'t end up with the ball falling out. Pearce moved up to second on the throw, but Hardy struck out to end the inning.    The bats were quiet until the fifth inning. Machado led off with a home run that just barely cleared the out-of-town scoreboard, his second homer of the season. He also had two walks on the day. After Adam Jones struck out, Cruz followed with a home run into the Orioles bullpen, his 16th in the Orioles 48th game. One home run for every three team games would end you up with 54 over a 162 game season. That will do. Many people celebrate the birth of a child by smoking cigars. The O\'s hitters celebrated the coming birth of the baby Davis by hitting a couple of home runs. Isn\'t that a unique way to mark the occasion? It\'s amazing to look at Cruz\'s performance so far this season after what he endured on the free agent market. He was sitting there and anyone could have signed him for only a draft pick. Even after it became apparent that he would be settling for a one-year deal, someone could have had him. The Orioles got him for $8 million. Has anyone ever spent $8 million better? Maybe if you got in to Apple or Google on day one. I guess. Your stock portfolio isn\'t winning the Orioles any baseball games.    Anyway, the Orioles had a 4-2 lead after the pair of homers and that was all for Bauer on the day. Pearce greeted new pitcher Mark Lowe with a ground rule double to left center. Hardy added a single, but they would not get another run out of the remainder of that rally. They did not need one. While all this was going on, Gonzalez navigated his way through six innings. He only gave up four hits, but also surrendered four walks and hit a batter. That\'s a lot of runners for six innings, but after the first inning, the Indians only advanced a runner beyond first base one time. That\'s really too bad. The O\'s turned to the bullpen for the final three innings, getting a scoreless inning each from Preston Guilmet, Brian Matusz, and Zach Britton, who only allowed two runners to reach between the three of them. Guilmet went to 3-ball counts on his first two hitters, ending up with a one-out walk to ninth hitter Justin Sellers. He responded by striking out the next two batters to get out of the inning. Not bad for a guy who spent yesterday in roster limbo. As Britton plowed through the Indians lineup in the ninth for his second save, the only tense moment came when Britton fielded a Baltimore chop and fired to first base to retire pinch hitter Ryan Raburn. After he fired the throw to first, he looked to be wincing. The trainer came out to check on him. He remained in the game, not even having to throw any warm-up tosses. Whatever it was, he was fine. With two outs, Britton had to face Sellers, who had basically no chance against 96-97mph sinkers. Sellers struck out looking and the game was in the books.    The win was only the second Sunday victory for the O\'s on the season, and it brought their record in day games up to an abysmal 6-12. Still, a win is a win. They are now 25-23 on the season and sit in third place in the division, 2.5 games back of the division-leading Blue Jays. They now head off to face NL Central-leading Milwaukee, against whom they will hopefully perform better than they have against the AL Central. Game one of the series is Monday afternoon, starting at 2:10 Eastern. The enigma that is Chris Tillman starts the game for the O\'s, with Kyle Lohse taking the ball for the Brewers.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have often had a pattern over the past 10-20 years of losing an unusual majority of Sunday games. It was almost like some sort of religious quirk about playing on Sunday!But yesterday the Orioles put together a very fine all-around game and defeated the Indians 4-2.A criticism of the Baltimore Orioles of 2014 has been about inconsistent play and not putting together the pitching and hitting at the same time. So the flow of the game on Sunday was especially encouraging to O\xe2\x80\x99s fans \xe2\x80\xa6 to see fairly solid pitching supported by some critical hits and aggressive base running, etc.Miguel Gonzalez will never be a dominant pitcher, but he has some very plus pitches when they are working well and he is commanding the ball on the edges of the plate. He needs the catcher to frame pitches well and to get into a rhythm with the umpire\xe2\x80\x99s strike zone du jour. On the latter point, even Buck Showalter commented after the game that there was an \xe2\x80\x9cinteresting strike zone today.\xe2\x80\x9d It did float around a bit. Nick Markakis surely drove home fuming about the random strike zone and being rung up a couple of times on sketchy calls.But Gonzalez settled down after allowing two first-inning runs, pitching six innings and giving up only four hits, though he would walk four and hit a batter.Some very nice and aggressive base running by Steve Pearce and Nelson Cruz helped the Orioles claw out two tying runs, setting up game-winning home runs in the fifth inning by Manny Machado and Cruz (his 16th). Pearce had three hits on the day and is now batting .333.The bullpen contribution of an inning each from Preston Guilmet, Brian Matusz, and Zach Britton only allowed one hit (in the eighth inning) and preserved the victory. Britton was especially sharp and took to the mound with an aggressive \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in your face and coming after you\xe2\x80\x9d demeanor that was great to see. Has anyone else EVER seen a 97-mph sinker like he is throwing right now?TRADE \xe2\x80\x93 Patton for HundleyThe Baltimore Orioles secured the services of a veteran catcher over the weekend by trading reliever Troy Patton for Nick Hundley. I certainly applaud this move. Patton was a nice piece in the bullpen and has been worth his salt over multiple years since coming to the O\xe2\x80\x99s for Miguel Tejada. But \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d has happened off the field, while his \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d on the mound has been marginal. He was not as effective in 2013 and has had several very rough recent outings where there was nothing deceptive about his pitching. The off-field issue and suspension was not helpful, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wondered if he fits well in this clubhouse with what he presents as an aloof personality \xe2\x80\xa6 and I could be entirely wrong on that final point.There is no doubt from remarks by former Padres teammates Brad Brach and Evan Meek that Hundley will fit well on this team. They describe him as a strong people person and a very \xe2\x80\x9cintense\xe2\x80\x9d player \xe2\x80\x93 gotta like hearing that.He is currently hitting .271, though again, this is not a selection to provide offensive punch. He did hit .288 in 82 games in 2011. His career average is .238 over a total of 510 games. And he does have some power potential that may play better in Baltimore than in San Diego.Does this move tip off a belief (either known or feared) that Matt Wieters is headed for ligament surgery? Dan Duquette is the ultimate poker face about such things, but I really do not think on this occasion that a certain loss is pending. It is simply that the percentage chance of that is sufficiently high enough to seek out greater catching depth.Monday\xe2\x80\x99s Memorial Day GameThe Baltimore Orioles find themselves today in Milwaukee to open a 10-game road trip. The rare nature of playing the Brewers was simply brought home to me in the previous sentence where I had to check my accuracy of spelling \xe2\x80\x9cMilwaukee.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0It is something I don\xe2\x80\x99t do or write about \xe2\x80\x93 never been there, and when do the Orioles ever play these guys? Apparently not since 2008.The Birds will be facing a very tough customer in Kyle Lohse who is 6-1 over his 10 starts with an ERA of 2.67 and WHIP of 1.05.\xc2\xa0 He has already thrown 67.1 innings this year; he gives up something in every start, though never very much. His history against the Orioles is with his original team, the Twins, and is now a decade old and largely irrelevant.The Orioles will send either Jekyll or Hyde to pitch today. Will it be the Chris Tillman of the three-hit complete-game shutout, or the person who could not get more than three outs in his most recent start? He does not have to be the former, though the Orioles cannot bear the latter. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if God even knows which one will show up!\xc2\xa0 Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m not uncertain about that, though it seemed like a good sentence for this paragraph.Game time is 2:10. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Would the Orioles Use Walker in a Trade? - Birds Watcher', 'Mandatory Credit: Bruce Thorson-USA TODAY SportsIt is obvious the Orioles are having trouble with starting pitching. By\xc2\xa0Chris Tillman giving up six runs today, his ERA on the year\xc2\xa0is up to an unimpressive 4.69. If the Orioles want to make a run for the postseason this year, they are going to have to acquire a true ace.Baltimore needs a pitcher who can go at least seven innings every outing and someone who, when he is out there on the mound, makes everyone around him better from the bullpen to the utility players on the bench.I see the Orioles have two options that are realistic in obtaining.The first is David Price. With his ERA at the highest it has been since 2009, I truly believe the Rays are going to dump him.Price is a luxury the Rays cannot afford. Harold Reynolds said on MLB Network just last week that he would be shocked if Price was still on the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 roster by the All Star Break. With a need for more minor league talent, I foresee the Rays parting ways with their former Cy Young Award winner.The other option and an option the Orioles would be hard-pressed in passing by is the Cubs\xe2\x80\x99 ace, Jeff Samardzija. With his 1.68 ERA, which is second lowest in the MLB next to Adam Wainwright (1.67), the Cubs are going to have to trade him soon before his ERA goes up any more.Although he is their best pitcher in the organization, the Cubs still find themselves in last place. They need players who can hit and hit consistently. The Cubs also need to improve their bullpen as well.Obviously, the Orioles will not be able to obtain one of these pitching studs with just a second or first round draft pick in the upcoming years. These teams want somebody who is going to be a star for them and contribute almost immediately after signing his new contract with either the Rays or the Cubs.With that being said, it comes down to the Orioles asking themselves, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we willing to give up?\xe2\x80\x9d Due to how much of an impact he has been for the team this year, Nelson Cruz cannot leave Baltimore. However, there are some players in the line up that I believe the Orioles can move forward without.Nick Markakis. I know I will probably get a lot of flack for saying that but I think it is true. I see the Orioles as a team that can move Cruz over to right field and then bring up Francisco Peguero from Norfolk to play left. Although Markakis does have .295 average this year and just recently moved into eighth place for most hits all-time with the Baltimore Orioles, he does have his weaknesses.In the field, Markakis never appears comfortable moving back on the ball. Along with this, he is not a power hitter. He will mainly only get you singles. This is a player that, however unfortunate because he has been with the team for so long, is expendable.Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY SportsAnother player the Orioles may have to give up is one of their good relievers. I have not the slightest clue as to which one, but if the Orioles want Samardzija, they are going to have to give up a big name like Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day who has a 0.90 ERA and a 2-0 record this year.If the Orioles really want Price, I can see them also offering up their #13 prospect Christian Walker. Walker is on a tear this year with the Bowie Baysox in Double-A. Hitting .330 with a .390 on-base percentage this season, Walker is a very promising player. Also driving the ball for 14 \xe2\x80\x9cround trippers\xe2\x80\x9d already this season, Walker has proved to be a power hitter.In summary, if the Orioles want Price, I see them starting the trade talk by offering Markakis and Walker. If the Orioles want Samardzija, I see them offering Markakis and a top quality reliever like O\xe2\x80\x99Day for starts and other possible prospects like Mike Wright and Kevin Gausman to follow. If Baltimore was able to land one of these two pitchers, what they would be gaining would far outweigh would they would be giving up.

Just checking. What we saw yesterday was a game in which the concept of the \xe2\x80\x9cFighting Showalters\xe2\x80\x9d was typified. Most people now liberally use that term for a game in which the Orioles battled back and thus fought until the final out. Granted, that was the original meaning of the term. However while the Baltimore Orioles did trail early in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game, they were also coming off of a 9-0 loss to the same Cleveland team one day prior. There was a chance that it stood to reason they might not have much pop.That certainly appeared to be the case from the get go. Starter Miguel Gonzalez seemed to have a problem locating home plate umpire Alan Porter\xe2\x80\x99s revolving strike zone. When he did, it seemed that Cleveland bats found the ball. Gonzalez loaded the bases with nobody down, and the Orioles and Gonzalez were forced to go into\xc2\xa0stay out of the big inning mode. Oriole-killer Lonnie Chisenhall gave Cleveland a 1-0 lead with a sac fly-RBI, and former Oriole-killer (from his NY days) Nick Swisher ran the score to 2-0 with a sac fly-RBI of his own.So to his credit, Gonzalez did limit the damage. And in fact he managed to settle down after the first inning and turned in a decent outing. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 4 BB, 4 K. So after all the fuss in the first inning, Gonzalez ended up with a quality start. But the Fighting Showalters started to make their move in front of a big hometown crowd in the last of the third. With two down Nelson Cruz missiled \xc2\xa0a double to center.\xc2\xa0The consistent Steve Pearce sent an RBI-single to left, and the Baltimore Orioles had cut the Cleveland lead to 2-1.Two innings later Manny Machado led off the fifth with a deep shot towards the scoreboard in right field; the ball barely made it over, but bounced back into play \xe2\x80\x93 and was ruled a home run. When Cleveland manager Terry Francona didn\xe2\x80\x99t challenge, the score stood tied at two. LaterCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportsin the inning Nelson Cruz sent a fly ball towards the bullpen area that started carrying a good bit. The ball barely cleared the wall, and the Orioles led 4-2.Preston Guilmet, Brian Matusz, and Zach Britton combined to pitch three innings in relief, and gave up a base hit and a walk. This incarnation of the Baltimore Orioles seems to be somewhat similar to the 2012 team that went to the postseason in the sense that the bullpen closes the door. All of that however is contingent on the starting pitcher getting deep into the game; while the O\xe2\x80\x99s would like to see seven innings out of their starters, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s six innings from yesterday.Should fans read into anything in regards to the bullpen doors swinging open in the ninth yesterday and Zach Britton emerging? Tough to say for sure, although this was Britton\xe2\x80\x99s second save on the year. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning or arguing about until Tommy Hunter comes off the DL and is ready to play again. That\xe2\x80\x99s when the real question of\xc2\xa0who closes will come to be answered.In that vain, keep in mind that the O\xe2\x80\x99s can keep Hunter on a rehab assignment for 20 days or so. I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that they\xe2\x80\x99ll do that, however if Showalter is seriously considering Zach Britton as the full time closer, perhaps they\xe2\x80\x99ll keep Hunter down in the minors for a few extra days so as to get an extended look at Britton. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, but it\xe2\x80\x99s an option. The fact is that DL stints and rehab assignments can be easily manipulated in MLB.  It\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see if Hunter is the closer when he returns from the DL. The Orioles head to Milwaukee for a three-game set with the Brew Crew, starting this afternoon at 2 PM eastern time. Chris Tillman will take to the bump to open the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 rare visit to the state of Wisconsin. Milwaukee is a hot team right now, and should provide some stiff competition for the Birds. Furthermore the Orioles will of course have to surrender their DH this week given the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re in an NL park. Tillman will need to improve on his previous start in Pittsburgh in which he was chased in the second inning last week; as Tillman would be the first to admit, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about fastball command. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Milwaukee\xe2\x80\x99s Kyle Lohse.On behalf of Birds Watcher and the Fansided Network, I want to take a moment to wish all Americans a Happy Memorial Day today.

Tim has been a collegiate football coach since 1973. That is when he began as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, Western Oregon State. Since then, he has had stints as a position coach at Oregon State, UCLA, SMU, and the University of Washington. He is now the inside linebackers coach at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas (UNLV). As a result of this, the Hundleys moved around a lot when Nick was a kid. He was born while his dad was coaching at Oregon State. They made some well-known friends with all of this mobility. The biggest one has a Baltimore tie. That would be football coach Rick Neuheisel, the former quarter back coach and offensive coordinator of the Ravens.    Coach Neuheisel and Tim Hundley were at the University of Washington at the same time. They befriended one another and their families grew close as well. In fact, Neuheisel would invite them to his Lake Washington-adjacent home to ride jet skis.    As was a normal part of his nomadic childhood, Nick attended two different high schools but he finished up at Lake Washington High. There, he was a four-time letter-man on the baseball team and was named ""all-state"" following his senior season. This caught the interest of the Florida Marlins, who drafted him in the fifth round in 2002. He declined and instead enrolled at one of the few west coast universities that his father had not coached, the University of Arizona. Then came all of the collegiate baseball success. He was a ""Freshman All-American"" in 2003 and was named a second team All-American in 2005. He was again drafted in 2005, this time, by the San Diego Padres.    It would take Hundley parts of four seasons to reach San Diego. In two different years, he was lauded for his defensive prowess. Once in 2005, being recognized as the best defensive catcher in the Padres system. Then again in 2007 when he was named the best in the Texas League. However, in that time, he went from the number eight prospect in their system in 2006, to completely falling off the map in 2008, the year he would finally make his major league debut. That year of 2008 would continue to be lucky as Nick married his wife, Amy. The couple has been together ever since and now has a daughter, who was born last August.    Every holiday season, Nick and Amy have hosted ""Shop with a Jock"" at local Target stores in the San Diego-area. There, they help\xc2\xa0kids from a school for homeless children and let them pick out new shoes and clothes. By all accounts, Hundley looks to be one of the most likable guys in baseball. He is continually positive and up beat. I mean, he just oozes good vibes. Check out what he had to say after being traded to the O\'s: ""If there was one place I\'d want to be, it would be here,"" he said. ""When (GM Josh Byrnes) told me I was going to Baltimore, it was really, really exciting."" He then added this. ""The winning atmosphere, great tradition...Unbelievable park, the fans and city. A storied manager, a guy I know I can learn a lot from in terms of getting prepared and running games."" He seems cheesy, but I love this guy already. Some Favorites  animal: dogs outdoor activity: fishing sport(s) (besides baseball): swimming and racquetball  What\'s Ahead For the Orioles right now, Hundley appears to be the starting catcher of the moment.\xc2\xa0The reason is that Hundley is more of a classic catcher in that he can play some solid defense, but he is really not going to hit too much.    Over his career, he has thrown out 130 of the 470 stolen base attempts. That works out to a percentage of 27.7; not bad. Whereas Steve Clevenger has a career rate of half that; 13.3 percent. At the plate, he is mediocre, to be kind. Maybe I am just spoiled by Matt Wieters\' production in the early goings of the season, but some of Hundley\'s numbers are tough to look at, especially his on-base percentage. It is the same as his batting average. That\'s right, he has played in 33 games in 2014, and has yet to walk. Granted, that is only 59 plate appearances and many times he is coming into the game as a pinch hitter, but that is still ridiculous and not exactly a trait that the Orioles needed in another player. He is hitting .271, but he has been pretty lucky with a batting average on balls in play of .333. That is bound to fall back to his career average, just below .300, and when it does, so will his batting average. For his career, he is striking out 22 percent of the time, walking; seven percent. Both are sub-par. Though I\'m sure Buck will again stick to using the righty bat, Hundley, against left-handers, it will still not make much sense. Hundley has managed a .199 average against southpaws in his career. Overall, the move to get him was a necessary one and Troy Patton was expendable. However, this is not an impact bat. He is serviceable, can throw out some guys on the base-path, and is an upgrade at what the Orioles have currently, but he is no healthy Wieters.

Nick Hundley is the starter for now, allowing\xc2\xa0the O\xe2\x80\x99s to have someone with experience in the majors catch.But this is quite a move for Joseph, and has to be disappointing for Clevenger. But, remember that Matt Wieters is soon going to be a free agent. Allowing Clevenger to start every day in AAA and really see what they have in him could help the Birds decide what to do with Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 contract. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Fighting Showalters go to Wisconsin', 'Unfortunately, this column still starts the way I was planning on starting it prior to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s ninth inning; many Baltimore Orioles fans are now asking what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with Chris Tillman. If you compare yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game to his last start, you could say that there was marked improvement. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.2 IP, 7 H, 6 R, 4 BB, 7 K. However Tillman still struggled with his fastball command, and he struggled to find the strike zone for much of his outing. In fairness, he held Milwaukee scoreless in the second and pitched a clean fifth. However the question remains, why is Tillman struggling? Is he injured? Is there a mechanical problem?Unfortunately I don\xe2\x80\x99t have those answers for readers \xe2\x80\x93 right now. But it\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see how Tillman adjusts in his next start, which is Saturday in Houston. While Houston might come across as a \xe2\x80\x9cget well\xe2\x80\x9d type of game (and I say that keeping in mind that the Orioles cannot underestimate any opponent), if Tillman struggles again might the Orioles skip him in the rotation with an off day coming next Monday?The O\xe2\x80\x99s found themselves down 1-0 early as Jean Segura led off with a triple and he was doubled home by Ryan Braun. However in what would become a theme for the day, the Baltimore Orioles battled\xc2\xa0back. Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 two-RBI triple in the top of the third gave the Fighting Showalters the lead. Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-double would score Jones, and the Birds led 3-1.Milwaukee began chipping away, and they cut the lead to 3-2 on former Oriole Mark Reynolds\xe2\x80\x98 sac fly-RBI in the last of the aforementioned third inning. However Jean Segura would haunt Tillman yet again with a two-RBI double to seize the lead back for Milwaukee, who would also chase Tillman in the last of the sixth on back-to-back solo homers by Kris Davis and Lyle Overbay.However the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 the Fighting Showalters, that is \xe2\x80\x93 weren\xe2\x80\x99t quite done. Jonathan Schoop\xe2\x80\x98s bat came alive with a solo homer in the seventh to bring the Birds to within one. And the score remained 6-4 as the game went to the top of the ninth. Former Oriole Francisco Rodriguez came in to close things out for Milwaukee. To further infuriate Orioles fans, Rodriguez (who struggled after being traded to the O\xe2\x80\x99s last year \xe2\x80\x93 from Milwaukee no less) came in as the hottest closer in baseball. He was 17-for-18 in save opportunities. Sure thing, right? Not so fast\xe2\x80\xa6I said that this column started out in the same manner it would have otherwise begun prior to the ninth inning. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it ended the same way I had planned up to that point. After two quick outs, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 chances appeared to be dimming. However Jonathan Schoop picked a good time to net his second homer of the game, as he hit the first pitch he saw over the left field fence. Delmon Young followed that up with a pinch-hit single, and Buck Showalter promptly inserted David Lough as a pinch-runner. With his lightning speed, Lough scored without a throw on Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-double, and the game was suddenly tied at six.  As was written earlier on Birds Watcher, David Lough might be best utilized as a pinch-runner. Milwaukee put two runners on base with one out in the last of the ninth, however former Oriole Mark Reynolds came up big in a sense for his former team. He lined out to J.J. Hardy at short, who doubled the runner up at third base to end the threat. The O\xe2\x80\x99s may well have gotten some luck on that play, however a slight amount of luck is a big part of any comeback win.Courtesy of Benny Sieu-USA TODAY SportsIncidentally, J.J. Hardy began his career in Milwaukee. He received a nice ovation from the Miller Park crowd during pregame introductions. However what the fans probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect was that he would smack a clutch double with two outs in the tenth inning against his former team. That brought catcher Nick Hundley to the plate, who was making his Oriole debut after being traded to the Birds on Saturday from San Diego. Hundley sent an RBI-single to left field, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly had grabbed a 7-6 lead.Buck Showalter brought his left hand up to begin the last of the tenth, and Zach Britton emerged once again from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pen to close out the game. Britton recorded out number one on a ground out, but then proceeded to allow runners to reach first and second on a base hit and a walk. Milwaukee sent up Irving Falu as a pinch-hitter in hopes of him at least tying the game. However Britton induced a 4-3 double-play, ending the game and winning it for the Fighting Showalters.For a team that\xe2\x80\x99s had a few games get away from them which they should have won, this was a huge victory. Perhaps it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the biggest comeback of all time in terms of the number of runs made up, however I would submit it was the best comeback of the season thus far. Against great odds and a closer that had been clutch to that point, the Orioles typified the concept of playing until the final out. \xc2\xa0What happens from here remains to be seen, but this is the type of game one might point back to as one where things really got rolling.Wei-Yin Chen gets the ball in tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game two in Milwaukee, and he finds the Orioles in dire need of a long outing from a starter. Part of that is due to Tillman not going deep into yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game, however in truth it was also an extra inning game so that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not on Tillman. (In fact he found himself as the beneficiary of that.) Chen will be opposed by Matt Garza, with whom the Orioles are familiar based on his time in Tampa. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

A terrible season that resulted in a top 5 pick meant that you could actually get excited about getting one of the top names in the upcoming draft, someone who could immediately become one of the best prospects in the system, a name with a bright future in baseball. Or so it seemed at the time. As we look back on top 5 overall picks like Matt Hobgood or even Brian Matusz, we know that not even top picks work out how they\'re supposed to. The Orioles were not bad in 2013. Thank goodness for that. Still, that does make the draft a less exciting affair. Players who are going at the very top of the draft, like Brady Aiken, Carlos Rodon, and Tyler Kolek, will interest someone, but not Orioles fans. Thanks to the signings of Ubaldo Jimenez and Nelson Cruz, as well as the competitive balance pick sent to Houston in the Bud Norris trade, the Orioles won\'t even pick in the upcoming draft until the third round, at #90 overall. Not only can you forget about the big names, but you can skip right over the next Hunter Harvey, too. The awesomely-named Touki Toussaint? Forget about him. Max Pentecost? Nope. Just keep on going. One consequence of giving up those picks is that in MLB\'s new draft slotting system, the Orioles have the smallest bonus pool out of all teams. They will only have $2,204,400 available to spend on picks, which is the lowest by far. The team in 29th is the Yankees, who have almost $1 million more in their bonus pool. The possibility of signing earlier picks for below slot to go over-slot later is not likely to be available to the Orioles this time around. The slot value of the #90 pick is only $594,200.    Who will be there for them to take? Trying to do a three-round mock draft would be a foolish endeavor. You can at least get a sense of what kind of talent might be available by scanning assorted prospect lists to see who\'s there at #90. It\'s still not likely the Orioles will take exactly one of those guys at #90, but they\'ll probably get someone they see as a similar level of talent.     MLB.com - J.J. Schwarz, C, Palm Beach Gardens HS (Fla.)  Other ranks: 71st (Law), 54th (Baseball America), 49th (Minor League Ball) After taking three high school catchers with their first seven picks in the 2013 draft, it would be something of a surprise if the Orioles targeted a high school catcher with their first pick in this draft, especially since it\'s a third round pick. Then again, you can never have too many catchers, something the Orioles are discovering for themselves this year.    You also never know who might turn out to be better than what you\'ve got. In 2007, the Orioles drafted Matt Wieters in the first round. He was to be the vanquisher of all evil in Baltimordor. One year later, picking high, another catcher, Buster Posey, was available. The Orioles were never much linked to him. Why would they be when they had Wieters? Posey has gone on to win a Rookie of the Year Award, National League MVP Award, and has been a part of two World Series championship teams. The Orioles took Matusz one pick before the Giants selected Posey. Here is what MLB.com says about Schwarz: Schwarz is a solid defender behind the plate. His arm is slightly above average, and he is a steady receiver. Offensively, he has an advanced approach and a balanced, level swing. He creates good bat speed and projects to have at least average power. Well, that sounds like fun. There\'s also the underrated name aspect, in that his name would provide a vehicle for countless Spaceballs jokes. Since the other evaluators all have Schwarz ranked higher, it seems like some team will probably pop him before #90 comes along. He is committed to the University of Florida.    ESPN\'s Keith Law - Wyatt Strahan, RHP, University of Southern CaliforniaOther ranks: 98th (MLB.com), 93rd (Baseball America), 123rd (Minor League Ball) Strahan, the Friday starter for USC, looks to be a name much more likely to be on the board at pick #90. Of course, that\'s no guarantee the Orioles care the slightest bit about him. There are a lot of players out there and they only get to pick one. Most of these lists don\'t include any individual comment on Strahan. The 90th-best prospect in a given draft doesn\'t matter until he develops into someone who does. MLB.com, in that way that they can make anyone sound exciting, offers this:\xc2\xa0With a big, strong, durable frame, Strahan looks well built to eat up a lot of innings in the future. He\'s added velocity and touches the mid 90s somewhat consistently with a fastball that also features a good amount of sink. His hard curve has the chance to be an out pitch, and he shows good deception and sink with his changeup at times as well. He gets praise for his mound presence, though he does need to improve his control in the future. He is listed at 6\'3"", 225 lbs. on the USC website. That\'s a guy who probably eats more than just innings. They aren\'t kidding about the control, either. He walked 49 batters in 104.1 innings this season. Nickname potential: Wyatt Earp  Baseball America - Daniel Gossett, RHP, ClemsonOther ranks: 87th (MLB.com), 51st (Law), 128th (Minor League Ball)  If someone like Law thinks Gossett ranks as high as 51st, you have to figure at least one MLB team will have him in their top spot when they draft some time before pick #90. You never know, though. He could be the kind of guy sitting there, too.    The MLB.com optimism about him:\xc2\xa0Gossett often works in the low 90s with his fastball and tops out around 94 mph. He does a good job of commanding his heater, which is crucial because it\'s fairly straight. His best offering is a hard slider, and his changeup gives him a reliable third pitch. They also note the possibility that, at 6\'1"" with a thin frame, he could be more suited for relief in the big leagues rather than as a starter. While that was a disappointing outcome for a #4 overall pick like Matusz, getting a bullpen arm for a third round pick sounds fine to me. Nickname potential: Goose? There is already a Goose. This could get confusing.  Minor League Ball - Bobby Bradley, 1B, Harrison Central HS (Gulfport, Miss.)Other ranks: 60th (MLB.com), 58th (Law), 84th (Baseball America)  You are probably noticing the common pattern here, that these names will probably be gone before pick #90 comes up for the Orioles. There is not much point getting attached to a name that will either be gone or uninteresting to the Orioles. Our SB Nation compatriots are the lowest of the bunch on Bradley, who gets this glowing MLB.com capsule:\xc2\xa0Bradley has an extremely advanced bat for a prep player and the power to match. He has a sweet left-handed swing with plenty of bat speed, as well as a willingness to use the entire field. He focuses on making hard contact rather than selling out for home runs, though he still can hit the ball out of any part of any park.    Well, heck, when you put it that way, why isn\'t he going first overall? Probably because he has a bunch of flaws. By the time you get to #90, they all have flaws, meaning it\'s up to player development to polish them into something. The Orioles have such a great track record of developing hitters and pitchers in recent years. That was sarcasm just there. He is committed to LSU. Nickname potential: BB? If he ever took a walk, which, if the Orioles draft him, he probably wouldn\'t. With Troy Patton having been traded, Bradley would replenish the supply of O\'s players sharing a last name with a famous World War II general. ** Not even the Orioles know who they\'ll be taking at #90 in the upcoming draft, because there is no way to know what players will be available at the time they draft. If the Orioles had higher picks, we would not even notice or care who they took in the third round. Since this is the first one they get in the draft, it will feel more important than it would otherwise. The draft begins on June 5 with rounds one and two, but the Orioles won\'t even get to pick on day one. Do they still have to send someone to the studio? They will make their first selection on June 6, when rounds 3-10 take place beginning at 1 o\'clock in the afternoon.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The shot barely got over the left field wall.""I was screaming at it,"" Springer said. ""I was saying \'Go, go, go\' and it went. So thank you, baseball.""Springer\'s 10 home runs in May extended his Astros rookie record and tied him for the third most long balls by a rookie in May with Jose Canseco, Wally Joyner and Walt Dropo. Mark McGwire set the rookie record for home runs in May with 15 in 1987.""What a guy,"" Houston manager Bo Porter said of Springer. ""It\'s been pretty impressive. It\'s fun to watch. It\'s almost must-see TV.""Springer said he was happy to help the Astros continue winning and gave a lot of credit to the man hitting before him in the lineup, Jose Altuve, who had three hits.""The guy that\'s on base, and it\'s always Jose Altuve,"" Springer said of his late game poise. ""He\'s always on base, and with him on base, I understand that he\'s a threat. With him on base, if they miss, I have to hit it.""Your browser does not support iframes.Springer became the first Astros rookie to hit seven home runs in seven games and first Houston player to do it since Morgan Ensberg in 2006. Ensberg, however, hit his seven home runs over a six-game span.""He\'s an exciting player,"" Porter said. ""At any moment, he can change the game with one swing. It doesn\'t matter if he\'s 0 for 3 or 3 for 3, he has the ability to impact the game every time he steps into the batter\'s box.""Brad Peacock allowed a run on six hits with eight strikeouts in six innings. Peacock, who was scratched prior to his scheduled start May 24 at Seattle with forearm soreness, went six innings for the fifth straight start.Porter said it was the best Peacock had pitched all season.Peacock said it was the best he had felt all year, and he was able to locate his pitches.""I went out there, I wasn\'t scared,"" Peacock said. ""I threw my fastball, the team came up with some big plays. Springer got the homer and the team got the win. That\'s all you can ask for.""Josh Fields (1-3) threw two scoreless innings for the win, and Chad Qualls pitched the ninth for his fourth save.Ubaldo Jimenez allowed one run on three hits with eight strikeouts in six innings. Jimenez had struggled in his last two outings, allowing 10 runs in nine innings.""I was able to get a little bit deeper in the game and that\'s always good,"" Jimenez said. ""Hopefully I get deeper than that in my next game. I felt good. I was able to be there for the team.""Houston could not take capitalize with runners in scoring position, going 0 for 11 against Jimenez and finishing 1 for 15 with runners in scoring position with the lone hit being Springer\'s home run.Nelson Cruz remained hot, extending his hit streak to 10 games with two hits, including an RBI single in the fourth that tied it at 1. The Orioles losing streak reached three games.""It\'s not always going to click together,"" Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said of the Orioles\' inconsistency of late. ""You\'re hoping one part of the game is good enough to offset another and we have for the most part. I have a lot of confidence that our best baseball is ahead of us. Tonight we just didn\'t swing the bats well enough Ubaldo deserved a better fate.""Jason Castro scored from third on a wild pitch by Jimenez in the second on a close play at the plate to make it 1-0. After a 4 minute, 25 second review, the call was upheld \xe2\x80\x94 Castro was safe.Jimenez, who had loaded the bases with one out on two walks and a single before Castro scored, escaped the inning by inducing groundouts to Robbie Grossman and Jonathan Villar.NOTES: Baltimore right-hander Tommy Hunter, on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to May 21 with a left groin strain, has been throwing on flat ground for four days and feels good, Showalter said. \xe2\x80\xa6 Orioles catcher Matt Wieters, on the 15-day DL since May 11 with a right elbow strain, is expected to start doing light tossing Friday, Showalter said. \xe2\x80\xa6 Houston will send lefty Brett Oberholtzer to the mound Friday against Baltimore right-hander Miguel Gonzalez in the annual Major League Baseball Civil Rights Game.

05/30/2014,"[(""The Best 'One and Done' Orioles - Camden Chat"", "" Baltimore television and radio personality Mark Viviano posed an interesting question after Nelson Cruz hit his 17th home run of the season on Tuesday in Milwaukee.   Pondering Nelson Cruz 17 HR, 46 RBI. IF he's 1-&-done w O's could he be best 1-&-done ever for O's? Reggie 27 HR, 91 RBI in '76. Any better?\r \xe2\x80\x94 Mark Viviano (@MarkWJZ) May 28, 2014     Cruz has (as of Thursday) produced over 2 bWAR for the Orioles thanks to his MLB leading 19 home runs. He could well be on his way to a 5+ WAR season. It is likely that this will be his only season in Baltimore, as he will almost assuredly land the big dollar, multi-year deal he hoped to land this past off-season. So I figured I'd comb through the\xc2\xa0Baseball Reference archives in search of an answer to Viviano's question. The results were quite interesting and somewhat surprising. Reggie Jackson (1976) Viviano's assumption was correct. Reggie Jackson put up a pretty darn good season during his one year as an Oriole. After\xc2\xa0holding out over contract demands resulted in him missing the first 16 games of the season, Jackson would go on to produce 5.3 bWAR in just 134 games. He hit 27 home runs, good for a tie for 2nd in the AL, and led the AL in SLG% (.502) and OPS+ (155). As an added bonus, he stole a career high 28 bases, his 80% success rate ranking 5th in the AL that year. But his efforts would not be enough to help an Orioles squad in transition catch the AL East champion Yankees, as the Birds finished a distant 2nd with an 88-74 record. Jackson would, of course, go on to sign a lucrative free agent contract with those Yankees the following off-season, and win two World Series rings during his 5 years in the Bronx.    Somewhat surprisingly, Jackson is the only significant positional player to produce a very good '1 and Done' season for the Orioles. Center fielder Chris Singleton produced a 1.8 bWAR season for the O's in 2002 before being granted free agency after the season. And 3B Danny Valencia was worth 0.9 bWAR over his 170 plate appearances with the 2013 Orioles.    Kevin Brown (1995) Following 6 modestly successful season with the Rangers, Brown signed a 1-year contract with the Orioles after the ending of the 1994 player's strike. He looked to be the perfect complement to young starters Mike Mussina and Ben McDonald in the Baltimore rotation, and he produced to that effect. 172.1 innings pitched over 26 starts resulted in a 4.3 bWAR thanks to a 3.60 ERA (3.49 FIP) and a 133 ERA+. But much like Reggie Jackson's lone season in Charm City, the club was in a transition phase. Johnny Oates had been fired following a 2nd place finish in '94 and replaced by Cleveland Pitching Coach Phil Regan. The pitching staff flourished, allowing a 2nd best 4.44 runs/game, but the offense floundered, scouring a well below average of 4.89 runs/game. Brown would sign a multi-year contract with the Florida Marlins during the off-season and transform into one of the most dominant pitchers in the game over the following two seasons. He led the NL in ERA (.,89) and ERA+ (255) in 1996, and helped the Marlins win their first World Series in 1997. He actually took a near $1 million pay cut from his 1995 salary with the O's to his 1996 salary with the Marlins. Oh, what could have been if he had remained with the O's during the '96 & '97 season...    David Wells (1996) With the departure of Brown the Orioles needed to fill a large hole in their rotation. Who better to fill such a spot than David Wells! In the final year of his contract with Detroit, Wells was shipped to Baltimore for a couple of young outfield prospects. Wells didn't pitch well, putting up a 5.14 ERA and 97 ERA+. But he did eat innings; 224.1 over 34 starts to be exact. And those innings resulted in his compiling 2.9 bWAR. Combined with the contributions of Mike Mussina and Scott Erickson, Wells helped propel the Birds to the playoffs for the first time since 1983. Wells earned the win in the O's only victory during that\xc2\xa0tainted ALCS of 1996. Like Reggie Jackson 20 years prior, Wells would head up to Gotham following his one season with Baltimore and experience numerous career highlights, including pitching a Perfect Game and winning a World Series ring in 1998. Mike Torrez (1975) Torrez was involved in one of the better trades in Orioles history, coming from Montreal along with Ken Singleton in exchange for a soon to be out of baseball Dave McNally, young outfielder Rich Coggins, and a minor leaguer. A year later Torrez would be part of the package sent to Oakland in exchange for one Reggie Jackson. In between, he put up 3.5 bWAR over his 36 starts and 270.2 IP. In spite of a league leading 133 walks he managed to pitch to a 3.06 ERA and complied a 20-9 Win-Loss record. He would go on to have an even better '76 season with Oakland, thanks in large part to cutting his walk rate significantly. Early in the '77 season he would join Jackson in the Bronx via a trade, and would go on to earn two Wins in the World Series.    Mark Eichhorn (1994) Easily the most surprising name here. Eichhorn was a 33 year old middle reliever who had spent the bulk of his career with either Toronto or the Angels. The Orioles signed him to a 2 year deal prior to the '94 season, and he pitched exceptionally well during the strike-shortened season. 2.6 bWAR produced in just 71.0 innings pitched over 43 games is pretty impressive stuff. Particularly when he only struck out 35 in that span. Keeping the ball in the yard was his skill, and allowing just 1 home run allowed him to keep his ERA at a sparkling 2.15 for the season. \xc2\xa0He would have been a strong part of the O's 'pen in '95 but missed the entire season due to injury, thus a 1 and Done career with the Orioles for Eichhorn. Not Orioles related, but Eichhorn's 1986 season is rather bananas. A 25 year old with Toronto, he put up 7.4 bWAR in 157.0 IP with a 14-6 record, 1.72 ERA, and 166 Ks. What is remarkable is that he did all of this without starting a single game! 7.4 WAR strictly pitching long relief in 69 games. Mind boggling.

And secondly, that is as good as they are right now. About half of the time they have a well-pitched game, and half of the time they hit the ball decently \xe2\x80\xa6 so, put that together and you have a team giving you a .500 performance.Go ahead and think of me or call me negative, but this is the current reality.

Josh Stinson got the start for Norfolk. He went 4.1 innings and gave up four earned runs off of eight hits. Stinson also struck out eight in his outing as well.Although Xavier Paul went 0-4 on the night, on two separate occasions a wild pitch occurred when he was up to bat and two runs scored off these mistakes from the Lehigh Valley pitchers. One of these wild pitches came in the ninth inning with the Tides down 4-1. After a wild pitch with the bases loaded scored a run making it a two-run game, Chris Marrero stepped up to the plate with two outs.After Marrero worked the count to 2-1 with runners on second and third, he connected on a pitch up in the zone for a line drive single to center field. The runner from third scored easily making it a one run game, but Brett Wallace got the green light, rounded third and headed for home. Unfortunately the game ended there when Lehigh Valley\xe2\x80\x99s center fielder threw the ball \xe2\x80\x9con an invisible rope\xe2\x80\x9d to home where the throw beat the runner for the third and final out of the game.Although he got thrown out at home for the last out, Wallace had a good game at the plate, going 2-4 with two singles. He accounted for half of Norfolks hits in the ballgame as well. Steve Lombardozzi was one of six Norfolk batters who did not record a hit in the game; going 0-3 in the game. This lowers Lombardozzi\xe2\x80\x99s average to .284. The loss drops the Tides\xe2\x80\x99 record to 20-34 on the year and the team currently sits in fourth place of the South Division in the International League.Bowie BaysoxThe Bowie Baysox got crushed Thursday night, losing to the Akron Rubber Ducks by a score of 16-4. After Bowie\xe2\x80\x99s starter, Zach Davies, was knocked out of the game early only going 3.1 innings and giving up three runs. The Baysox bullpen was unproductive to say the least. Between the four Bowie relievers, a combined 13 runs off of 13 hits and 10 walks.In regards to the offense, there was a bright spot; however, insignificant it may be in such a brutal loss. Christian Walker went 2-3 on the night with an RBI single in the bottom of the eighth to score Bowie\xe2\x80\x99s final run of the night. This improved Walker\xe2\x80\x99s batting average to .330 on the year.Bowie\xe2\x80\x99s record on the year is now 29-24 and they currently sit in second place of the Western Division in the Eastern League.Frederick KeysThe Frederick Keys lost on Thursday night by a score of 3-6 against the Lynchburg Hillcats. This loss earned Lynchburg the sweep over the Keys in the three-game series.The Keys\xe2\x80\x99 starting pitcher, Brady Wager, pitched well as he went six solid innings giving up one earned run off of six hits in the process. Frederick was down 2-1 going into the top of the seventh inning. However, they took the leas thanks to the two-run double of Glynn Davis. This lead would be short-lived as \xc2\xa0the Hillcats scored the final four runs of the game off of right-handed reliever Miguel Chalas. Chalas gave up a game-tying home run in the bottom of the seventh and then allowed three more runs to score in the eighth inning.Davis\xe2\x80\x99 two-RBI double improved his batting average to .314 on the year. Four other Keys players each recorded a single hit, including Zane Chavez who also hit a double that scored a run in the game on Thursday.Frederick is now 21-30 on the year and sits at the bottom of the Northern Division in the Carolina League.Delmarva ShorebirdsThe Delmarva Shorebirds did something Thursday night none of the other Baltimore Minor League Affiliates nor could the Orioles do: Win. The Shorebirds picked up the win against the Lakewood BlueClaws by a score of 4-3.Down 2-0 early, the Shorebirds rallied back, scoring one in the fourth and another two in the fifth. All three of these runs were hit in by two Trey Mancini RBI singles. The Shorebirds added another run to their lead in the seventh inning with a sacrifice fly from Jeff Kemp scoring Mike Yastrzemski from third. Despite giving up a run to Lakewood in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Shorebirds were able to hang on and\xc2\xa0won the series opener.Mancini\xe2\x80\x99s two hit game improves his average on the year to .314.

He also walked two and gave up three hits (a single, a double, and a home run). Both runs he gave up were on a two-run home run in the first inning after a batter reached on an error by third baseman Buck Britton. The game was close until the eighth inning when relief pitcher Kelvin De La Cruz gave up four runs (two earned) in the eighth inning. The Tides defense was sloppy and they made two errors in the inning, one by catcher Steve Clevenger and the other another error by Britton. That's not to say De La Cruz was great, either. He did give up three hits in the inning. The Tides offense was offensive, taking a cue from their buddies at the big league level. They had just four hits and two walks in the game. LF Chris Marrero hit a solo home run and RF Quintin Berry scored on a ground out after reaching on a force out. Impressive.

Tyler Wilson started for the Baysox and his rough first inning included a single, a two-run homer, a walk, and a double. He went on to pitch eight innings without allowing another run and only gave up two more hits (both singles), but he also walked four to make things interesting. Jason Gurka pitched the top of the ninth inning and buried the Baysox hopes of a comeback with a terrible inning that saw him give up three runs on four hits and a walk.    The hitters could only score twice despite getting six hits and three walks against the awesomely named Jack Snodgrass. CF Dariel Alvarez was 2-for-4 with a double and a run scored. C Michael Ohlman was 1-for-3 with a walk and a run scored. 1B Christian Walker was 0-for-3 with a walk.    Frederick Keys 8, Wilmington Blue Rocks 1 Parker Bridwell was outstanding last night with 7 innings pitched and just one run allowed. He threw 98 pitches in the game with a ground out/fly out ratio of 8/3. He didn't walk a batter and he struck out nine. After a rough start to the season, Bridwell has gotten his act together over his last four starts. The lone run Bridwell allowed came after a lead off double. The runner moved to third on a fly ball and scored on a ground out. The Keys offense had a hit parade as only 2B Jerome Pena didn't get one (although he did draw the Keys' only walk).

I hope the BlueClaws crowd liked that excitement, because that's all they got.

Delmarva Shorebirds @ Lakewood BlueClaws, 4:05 pmShorebirds SP: Mitch Horacek  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles discover ""base on balls"" rules loophole, beat ...', ' Saturday afternoon, as they sought to break out of the mire of a four-game losing streak, the Orioles discovered a little-known loophole in the rules governing baseball. They learned that if a pitcher throws a batter four pitches that are outside of the strike zone, the batter shall be allowed to take first base. This obscure rule produces what is known as a ""base on balls""; the batter is safe at first even if he walks, without ever having to swing the bat. Orioles hitters took three of these bases on balls in a row in the top of the fifth inning, including two that came with the bases loaded. A base on balls with the bases loaded results in a run being forced home. This accounted for two of their runs in a 4-1 victory over the Houston Astros. It remains to be seen whether Major League Baseball will take action to close this loophole before it can do any more damage to the integrity of the game of baseball. After watching the Orioles flail away against the underperforming starting pitcher tandem of Brad Peacock and Brett Oberholtzer in the previous two games, there was little hope going in of the Orioles managing to solve one of the possible breakout aces of the 2014 season in Dallas Keuchel. This was not a predictable day of baseball. Noodle-armed Nick Markakis led off the game with a double. The play at second was close; Astros manager Bo Porter came out to stall for time, but declined to challenge the result. Replays showed on MASN indicated that Jose Altuve tagged Markakis before he was safely in to second base. An out later, Markakis would score on a sacrifice fly by Nelson Cruz, which gave the Orioles a 1-0 lead.    That sac fly represented the 50th run batted in of the season for Cruz, tying a record set by Chris Davis last year for most RBI before the end of May in franchise history.    Orioles starter Chris Tillman overcame some early shakiness to turn in a solid outing after some recent disasters. His problem inning was the second inning, in which he loaded the bases thanks to a double and a pair of hit by pitches. With one out, Robbie Grossman grounded a ball just along the edge of the grass down the first base line. Tillman was in position to field the ball, but opted to let the ball try to roll foul. The ball stopped right against the foul line in fair territory, scoring a run to tie the game 1-1 and keeping the bases loaded. This was not a good decision. Still, Tillman managed to escape without any further damage, getting a shallow pop-up from Marwin Gonzalez followed by a Jose Altuve flyout to right field. Altuve\'s ball was tailing away from Nick Markakis and looked like it was going to end up as a bases-clearing double, but Markakis managed to chase it down in the air to end the inning.    The score stayed knotted at 1-1 until the fifth inning, which was when the Orioles made their curious rulebook discovery. Manny Machado and Caleb Joseph each reached on singles while others made outs. With men on first and third and two down, Markakis was the first to take advantage of the newly-discovered ""base on balls"" loophole to load the bases. Perhaps inspired by this, left fielder Steve Pearce did not swing at some of Keuchel\'s pitches outside of the strike zone, allowing him to walk to first base as well. This particular ""base on balls"" meant that Machado scored. Cruz followed with another of these ""base on balls"", which forced in Joseph and gave the Orioles a 3-1 lead. Because some things never change, Adam Jones followed this radical back-to-back-to-back ""base on balls"" sequence by striking out swinging. Staked to this lead, Tillman pitched through 6.2 innings with what didn\'t look to be his best stuff. However, he kept the Astros from doing any more damage in the game, helped out periodically by his defense. Pearce made a sweet play on a line drive off the left field scoreboard from Marwin Gonzalez in the fourth inning, bare-handing the carom and firing in to second base to throw out Gonzalez trying to stretch the ball into a double.    In the seventh, Tillman walked leadoff batter Grossman, then induced a double-play grounder from Gonzalez. He had thrown 110 pitches. That was enough for O\'s manager Buck Showalter, who has shown too much faith in his starters at times. He brought in Ryan Webb for the last out of the seventh and left him in for the eighth. What a concept. Webb struck out two while not allowing a baserunner in 1.1 innings. Tillman\'s final line was one run on four hits and two walks in 6.2 innings. He struck out three. Some days, that\'s all you need. He was credited with a win for the game, improving his record to 5-2 despite a 4.63 ERA. Trade market starter Jeff Samardzija shakes his head. The Orioles tacked on an insurance run in the eighth inning thanks to a solo home run by Cruz, his 20th of the season. That\'s even more than the 19 Davis had at the end of May last season. Adding two RBI on the walk and the home run gave Cruz 52 on the season, meaning he now holds the Orioles record for most RBI by the end of May. Just for fun, he hit a ground rule double in the game as well. The guy is slugging .675. Wow. Zach Britton came on in the ninth to close out the game. He allowed a leadoff single to Matt Dominguez, but then he struck out pinch hitter Jesus Guzman on three pitches and got a double-play ball from pinch hitter Chris Carter to end the game and snap the Orioles losing streak. The win brings the Orioles back to a .500 record at 27-27. They are 4.5 games back of division-leading Toronto and 2.5 games behind the second place Yankees, both of whom won earlier on Saturday. Sunday afternoon, the O\'s will be back in action with a chance to salvage a series split against the recently-hot Astros. Wei-Yin Chen starts opposite former Oriole Scott Feldman in the 2:10 game.

Showalter is confident that Machado, who had two hits Saturday, will get back on track and thinks this move could help. ""We\'re just trying to be patient for him to work his way back into it, but that\'s a challenge,"" Showalter said. ""He gets frustrated. He hides it pretty well.

I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how many times I\xe2\x80\x99ve written\xc2\xa0it starts with pitching. That\xe2\x80\x99s far from an insightful piece of baseball knowledge, and in fact it\xe2\x80\x99s basically common knowledge for anyone that\xe2\x80\x99s around the game on a daily basis. Yet last night Miguel Gonzalez posted a quality start. In truth, he took a no-hitter into the sixth inning. However at the end all that matters I suppose is the bottom line\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and unfortunately that bottom line has Gonzalez on the losing end of a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s duel. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.2 IP, 5 H, 2 R, 2 BB, 4 K. Far from shabby if you ask me, and I suspect that Buck Showalter and the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense would say the same.  Showalter on Miguel[caption id=""attachment_12014"" align=""alignright"" width=""300""] Courtesy of Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports[/caption]Gonzalez: \xe2\x80\x9cHe deserved a much better fate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Many people criticized Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s decision to send Gonzalez out in the seventh inning; the fact is that his pitch count was not high. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it works with pitchers \xe2\x80\x93 sometimes in later innings they just lose it, no matter how good they were before.The Orioles took an early 1-0 lead in the second inning when Adam Jones doubled and was singled home by J.J. Hardy. And that lead stood up for some time. As Showalter also said after the game, Houston got a great quality start out of their pitcher as well. While it sounds redundant, the O\xe2\x80\x99s seem to have a knack for running into good pitching.However Adam Jones said it best after the game in that opposing teams are getting the clutch hits, and the Baltimore Orioles are not. Teams go through these types of stretches throughout the season, which is why we constantly hear the cliche\xc2\xa0it\xe2\x80\x99s a long season. However, frustration will often start to build on a team when you\xe2\x80\x99re constantly seeing balls drop in and clutch hits coming off of opposing bats.Jose Altuve recorded Houston\xe2\x80\x99s first hit of the game on an infield single to short in the sixth. And again, that really illustrates the type of stretch the Orioles are in. It\xe2\x80\x99s not always the hard hit balls or the deep shots that are undoing the O\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s the simple things in the game. Dominguez would lead off the seventh with a double, and he would be doubled home to tie the game by Grossman. Villar would then add an RBI-double of his own, and in a span of a few minutes the O\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly trailed 2-1.The Birds would put two runners on in the eighth, however Steve Pearce would fly out to left field to end the threat. Again, that illustrates how things are going for this team right now. Pearce hit the ball pretty well, but yet if it was just a little softer the game probably would have been tied. Adam Jones tried to bunt his way on base in the ninth, however the bunt went right up in the air and was caught.Chris Davis struck out to end the game, on a pitch that looked to be potentially borderline at best. The pitch was very high, and in my personal view it missed the strike zone. Davis and Buck Showalter share that thought \xe2\x80\x93 especially Showalter, who was not happy with the call at all.  After the game when talking about how the O\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t strike out too often in this game, Showalter said he specifically wasn\xe2\x80\x99t counting Davis\xe2\x80\x99 strikeout \xe2\x80\x93 since the last pitch wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a strike.  However again, those things will happen when you\xe2\x80\x99re scuffling at the plate at a team.So the O\xe2\x80\x99s now find themselves at one game under .500 for the first time since the beginning of the season. This is not a hole out of which they can\xe2\x80\x99t fight, and anyone with an inch of baseball savoir faire knows that every team will find themselves in a stretch like this at one point or another. Unfortunately for the Orioles, their bad stretch came\xc2\xa0at a time when a team in their division (Toronto) was winning nine straight games. While Toronto is now actually in a modest two-game losing streak, Jose Bautista last night threw out a runner at first base from right field (after what would normally have been a standard single) \xe2\x80\x93 for the second consecutive game.\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0how things go for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re riding high.The Orioles will try to end this losing streak this afternoon in a game that will be started by Chris Tillman, who\xe2\x80\x99s had a few poor outings in a row now. Does that trend continue, or does the law of averages at some point kick in and grant Tillman \xe2\x80\x93 and Oriole bats \xe2\x80\x93 a positive outing?

However that\xe2\x80\x99s not when you have to worry; you have to get concerned when things are going so amazingly that you can barely think straight (ie-Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s nine-game winning streak). Because either way the law of averages says that the pendulum swings back in the other direction.And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we saw yesterday, as the Baltimore Orioles ended their four-game losing streak by defeating Houston 4-1. Starter Chris Tillman had a nice bounce back start after two fairly poor ones (in which he was non-decisioned). Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.2 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 2 BB, 3 K. What\xc2\xa0we saw was a pitcher who did have a few control problems early on, but also one who was good enough to get himself out of trouble.  The nature of the position is such that pitchers will get themselves into some trouble in games. The good ones are good enough to get themselves out of it. Nelson Cruz hit a sacrifice fly following Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x98 lead off double in the first inning, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had an early 1-0 lead. Tillman needed nine pitches to get out of the first inning, but the second inning was a bit of a struggle. With one out and the bases loaded, Grossman dribbled a swinging bunt up the first base line. Tillman thought better of fielding it and in effect taking a sure out at first \xe2\x80\x93 and the ball died on the chalk. So not only did a run score (which was a given unless the ball had gone foul), but everyone was safe. In retrospect that was probably a poor decision on Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s part, however following a pop out Nick Markakis made a great catch on a ball that could have cleared the bases (off the bat of Jose Altuve) to end the inning.Courtesy of Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsThis game had the feel of one where an Oriole starter had a decent outing only to stay in for one or two hitters too many \xe2\x80\x93 similar to Friday\xe2\x80\x99s game. However that changed in the fifth inning when the Orioles loaded the bases after two singles and a walk. That brought Steve Pearce to the play, who also drew a walk and suddenly the O\xe2\x80\x99s were back in the lead. To add insult to injury (from Houston\xe2\x80\x99s perspective that is), Nelson Cruz also drew a walk and the inning ended with the Birds leading 3-1.Tillman seemed to get stronger as the game went on, and he overcame a few base runners here and there over time before leaving the game. Nelson Cruz would hit his big league-leading 20th homer of the season in the eighth inning to give the Orioles some extra padding on the scoreboard. Come the last of the ninth those bullpen doors swung open again and Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x98s left hand came up, summoning Zach Britton from the \xe2\x80\x98pen to close the game. And close the game he did, ending the four-game losing streak.I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard-pressed to argue that the bats came alive, however the fact is that the O\xe2\x80\x99s won this game by working counts and drawing walks. For a team that\xe2\x80\x99s last in the big leagues in walks, I do find it interesting that they in effect won the game due in large part to two bases-loaded walks.

He is quite dinger-prone, however. He's allowed 1 in each of his last 6 starts. On the plus side, he's walked just 1 batter in that same time frame, while K'ing 23.

Righties are teeing off on him though, to the tune of .296 / .348 / .519 over 181 plate appearances. whomp whomp. So he may not be a starter long term, but he does have the look of a guy who could be Baltimore bound at some point next year. Pretty good for a 50th round pick. The offense has gone into a bit of funk this past week, scoring just 11 runs over their last 5 games. Christian Walker was held hitless, but did draw a walk. Dariel Alvarez did hit his 10th HR to account for the Baysox lone run on the evening. Niuman Romero continues to have fortune favor him as he hit 12th double of the season and drew 2 walks. Why pitchers are pitching around him to get to Walker and Alvarez is a mystery to me. Michael Ohlman was 0-3 with a walk. But he did manage to throw out 1 of 2 base bandits.

After working a nifty 1-2-3 8th inning, Matt Hobgood allowed things to get interesting in the 9th when he allowed 2 ERs after a 1 out walk.    Pre-postgame fireworks were provided courtesy of Brenden Webb and Adrian Marin, who each belted solo home runs. Glynn Davis put up his typical line of going 1 for 4 with a double, run scored, and a strikeout. Delmarva 7 Lakewood (Phillies) 0 Did another O's pitcher manage to go 7 strong innings?

He is now 4 clear of a 3 way tie for 2nd which includes teammate Gregory Lorenzo. I really want to see a skills competition between Lil' Yaz and Dariel Alvarez.

It was a job he held until the day before he signed his first professional contract at age 17.\xe2\x80\x9cI go back far, back to my country, when I was a kid and working at my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s shop,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said before a game in Houston on Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to stay humble and stay in the present, you have to realize you\xe2\x80\x99re just another person and not to get a big head or anything.\xe2\x80\x9dCruz, 33, led the major leagues in home runs (20) and RBIs (52) through Sunday.

Through 55 games, he has driven in more than one-fifth of the team\xe2\x80\x99s total runs (22.2 percent).\xe2\x80\x9cHe\'s the same Nelson Cruz I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rangers manager Ron Washington, who managed him for most of his eight years in Texas. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\'s a guy who has power, and he\'s showing that. We\'ve seen it before, so I\'m not surprised to be seeing it again.\xe2\x80\x9cThey got a guy who can drive in big runs. They got a guy who loves to play the game.

The Orioles said he was day-to-day on Sunday, but Cruz was able to grip a bat Monday.The last time Cruz played in Arlington was Sept. 30, 2013, in the Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 postseason play-in game against the Tampa Bay Rays. It was his first game after serving the 50-game suspension for being part of the Biogenesis scandal.Before last season started, Cruz was first tied to the South Florida anti-aging clinic, so he played the first month with a cloud hanging over his head. In August, he was suspended and accepted the punishment, issuing a public apology and saying that a gastrointestinal infection before the 2012 season that made him lose 40 pounds had led him to seek out the assistance of PEDs.But from his first day with the Orioles in February, Cruz has said that he has put that in the past.\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the past,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember the stuff when people ask me about it, the fans yelling and screaming. But it\xe2\x80\x99s been a smooth ride this year. The rough part was last year, going through the process. From Day 1 in spring training, it was rough. During the season, every day, something new would come up, all the media, all the fans. This year has been easy. It\xe2\x80\x99s not even close at all.\xe2\x80\x9cI guess going through a tough process has made me a better player, a better person. It makes me realize I love the game. It\xe2\x80\x99s been good. As a player, you always want to have as smooth a career as you can, but unfortunately, that\xe2\x80\x99s not my case, and I have to live through that.\xe2\x80\x9dFitting in on a new teamThe Orioles welcomed Cruz from the beginning.

06/03/2014,"[('Get to know your Orioles: Ubaldo Jimenez - Camden Chat', ' He was once one of the premier pitchers in all of baseball. He has been to an All-Star games, came in third for the Cy Young Award and received a few votes in the MVP race. All the while his mommy was doing his laundry for him and cooking him dinner. This guy has got the life. Bio Name: Ubaldo Jimenez Jr. Number: 31 Born: January 22, 1984 (30 years old) in Nagua, Maria Trinidad Sanchez, D.R. Height: 6\'5""  Weight: 210 lbs Bats: RIght Throws: Right Signed: in 2001 as an amateur free agent by the Colorado Rockies Became an Oriole: signed a 4-year $50 million deal on February 19, 2014 Walk-up song: ""Rie Y Llora"" by Celia Cruz Family One of the most publicized aspects of Jimenez signing with the O\'s was that his entire family would move with him. That would be his father, Ubaldo Sr., mother, Ramona, and older sister, Leidys. That\'s right, ladies. He is a single, thirty-year-old, multimillionaire, who happens to live with his parents. From everything I have read, Ubaldo\'s ""mami y papi"" seem to be his entire world, and for good reason. The elder Ubaldo was in the military for 13 years and then took up two jobs, as a bus driver and a security guard, to support his family. Ramona was a nurse before having kids. After that, she sold homemade meals to get a little extra coin.    They did this to put Ubaldo and Leidys through school and to get them English lessons as children. Ubaldo would play baseball each day from 8 a.m. to noon, have lunch and then take a bus to Santo Domingo for three hours of lessons with his sister.    Even when Jimenez was being approached by scouts, his mother was there. In an anecdote Ramona shared with USA Today she said that the New York Mets offered a $20,000 bonus if Ubaldo would sign at the age of 16. His mother served as his agent and told them that her son would be finishing high school first. In fact, that was a condition under which he signed with the Rockies the next year for a $50,000 bonus. Ramona made sure he would be allowed to graduate before playing professional baseball. Now, the entire Jimenez clan is in Baltimore. Believe it or not, that is not strange for people from the Dominican. Ubaldo is not married and in Latin America, most people stay with their parents until they have a significant other. That is fine by the Orioles big righty. Who needs a personal chef or a maid when you have your mom? She cleans and cooks anything he wants, except for his favorite meat, goat. Apparently, it\'s hard to find in the U.S. Imagine that.    Quick facts   Hidden talent: Jimenez likes to dance. However, he refused to show off his moves at the Orioles ""Talent Show"" in the spring. ""I like to dance a lot. Latin dances, hip hop, everything, Merengue, you name it,"" said Jimenez in a recent Baltimore Sun article.  Favorite movie: For Love of the Game  If he wasn\'t a baseball player: He would be a doctor. His mother originally wanted him to pursue it as a career and his sister is currently studying to become one in the Dominican.  Favorite meal: Rice, chicken, and beans (I guess goat doesn\'t go well with the beans)  Off-season spot: back to the Dominican, where he also lives with his parents.  Prized possession: a picture of his niece, Crisley, and the Dominican Flag. (This guy is just a big, old teddy bear)  What\'s Ahead Jimenez has been far from the stabilizing force that many hoped for when he was given that big deal back in February. His ERA was hovering at or above five for much of the season. He doesn\'t light up the radar gun like he used to in Colorado. And he has moments where it seems like he has forgotten where the strike zone is altogether. However, he has the chance to be the saving grace for the Orioles in 2014. The internet was abuzz last week when the birds emerged as the ""leading team"" for the services of Jeff Samardzija. The rumor mill posted a bounty of two top pitching prospects for the righty. Come again? His career ERA sits just below four (FIP: 3.82). That\'s with his red hot start to the season. He averages eight and a half strikeouts per nine innings. And batters hit .244 off of him in his career. The Orioles have that exact same pitcher in Jimenez (career ERA: 3.96, FIP: 3.79, K/9: 8.28, BAA: .240), but with Ubaldo he has the upside and track record of surging late and propelling teams into the postseason. Samardzija? Well, he plays for the Cubs.    The Dominican native has thrown no less than 176.2 innings in each of the last six seasons. He knows what it takes to make it through the grind of a major league season and has pitched in the World Series. His experience is a priceless commodity on the staff and his track record speaks for itself. Patience, Camden Chatters, patience. How do YOU think Jimenez will pitch the rest of the way?

The O\xe2\x80\x99s have always been been a sum of the parts team.

Ubaldo Jimenez pitched much better than earlier starts with only allowing one earned run.His control was not perfect as he allowed four walks, but his pitching has improved over his recent starts.The bullpen allowed two runs, but they kept the game in control.

The starting pitching has only given up six runs of those 13.Over the past three wins, the starters have given up one run each, though only Jimenez did not receive a win because of the late-offense.The last three wins are what I consider complete team wins. The starting pitching holds the opposing team down below four runs, the bullpen keeps the lead, and the offense reaches the mark of four runs.Though the offense put up eight runs, I will be the person that points out the bad in the good.With those eight runs, the Orioles left 11 men on base. Before finishing the night 6-for-14 with runners in scoring position, the Orioles were 2-for-9 heading into the eighth inning.With three complete team wins, the offense left 23 men on base, while scoring 21 runs. There is still work to be done to score even more runs.Davis has had many chances to do so, but just cannot get the key hitI believe a good bit of the problem with leaving men on base is by having Chris Davis in the four and five spot in the lineup.He is not hitting right now, so he is not driving in runs when his spot comes up. Davis has had many chances to do so, but just cannot get the key hit.Even with that, the Orioles are still one of the top teams with runners in scoring position with a .285 batting average.Beyond the team wins, Buck Showalter has been managing games slightly different.Showalter pulled Jimenez from the game after just five and two-thirds innings with a single run given up. He did the same thing in the last game of the Houston series by pulling Wei-Yin Chen after just five and a third innings pitched.Chen only gave up one run on four hits.Showalter is recognizing that the pitchers may be doing well, but that has drastically changed with just one batter in the past. He is not taking chances by leaving starting pitchers in too long.I think this should be sending a message to those pitchers. Chen was extremely unhappy when he was pulled from the game.Not every pitcher is going to be as unhappy as Chen was, but I hope they realize that they need to improve to go deeper into games. Then, maybe, Showalter will give them the chance to close out an inning with two men on and two outs, instead of taking them out of the game.These past several games have been good signs, but the inconsistency of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 game-play makes me hesitate from believing they have it all figured out.With the Orioles riding a six-game win streak since last season against the Rangers, the next two games should give the Birds the lift they need before heading home.

On December 7, 1977, he was traded away to the Mariners where he held a 19-39 record in four years before he played his last Major League game at the age of 26 in 1981.Guinn never made it to the Major League level. He pitched two years for the Bluefield Orioles where he posted a 6.40 ERA in 104.0 innings pitched before giving up on his baseball dreams.However, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 third round draft choice turned out to be a \xe2\x80\x9cHall of Fame-caliber\xe2\x80\x9d pick.Murray made his debut with the Orioles in 1977. That year he hit 27 home runs, drove in 88 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s, and maintained a .283 batting average; all of which helped him win the American League Rookie of the Year Award that year.In the following years of his career, he proved to everyone that his first year in the Majors was not a fluke.Murray was one of the first switch hitters in the game of baseball who could hit and who could hit with power. And on September 6th, 1996, this statement was proven as fact when Murray crushed his 500th career home run in front of the home crowd at Camden Yards. This home run not only tied the game up at 3, but it also put Murray into a very elite group of ball players who could say they hit 500 home runs in their Major League career.  Murray has the third-most grand slams in Major League Baseball history with 19 total. Murray became a World Champion when he helped the Orioles win their third World Series title in 1983.In 13 years of playing in a Baltimore uniform, Murray was named to the American League All Star Team seven times. He won the Gold Glove Award three times and the Silver Slugger Award twice.When Murray\xe2\x80\x99s playing career in Baltimore came to an end, he finished with 2,080 hits (Orioles 3rd all-time), 1,084 runs (Orioles 3rd all-time), 343 home runs (Orioles 2nd all-time), and 1,224 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s (Orioles 3rd all-time).These numbers along with the numbers he acquired playing with the Dodgers, Mets, Indians, and Angels helped him reach his rightful spot in Cooperstown, New York as a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2003.That being said everyone should get excited when it is the Orioles turn to draft tomorrow in the third round because there may be another future Hall of Famer out there when the 90th overall pick rolls around.

Also, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe but if the season ended today the Orioles would be going to the playoffs. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of baseball left to play, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a good position to be in heading into June. With 57 games behind them the Orioles have seen the entire range of production from different players. Now with a little over a month left before the All-Star game, which players\xc2\xa0 will be rewarded with a trip to Target Field on July 15?Nelson Cruz is the obvious first to mention. His 21 homeruns and 55 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s have carried\xc2\xa0the club through a streak that saw several other players not playing up to their ability. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a question whether Cruz will be an all-star. The question the Orioles should be asking themselves is when they should start trying to extend him past this season. Cruz was a bargain at 8 million a year, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t be a bargain this offseason. The Orioles need to push for a long-term deal or they\xe2\x80\x99re going to see a lot of their offense walk away.Unless he completely falls apart in June, Zach Britton has to be an all-star. He has been the most valuable pitcher on the team, and one of the best relievers in all of baseball. He solidified a closer role that looked to be a major weakness in the first few weeks of the season. He\xe2\x80\x99s been dominate with an ERA of just 0.88, and opponents are only hitting .192 against him. Nobody probably would have predicted it in March, but Zach Britton will most likely be in the bullpen for the American League All-Stars.It\xe2\x80\x99s been lost a bit with all the attention Zach Britton has gotten, but Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day has quietly been dominant all season. In 24 innings this season O\xe2\x80\x99Day has 0.75 ERA, and in that time he\xe2\x80\x99s given up only two runs both on solo homers. He still dominates righties, but this season he has a 1.29 ERA against left-handers. If he keeps throwing this well he\xe2\x80\x99ll join Britton in Minnesota for his first All-Star game appearance.Adam Jones and Nick Markakis could both make the team if their production continues through June. Markakis is hitting .308 which is 9th in the American League, and also has an OBP of .366 which is 7th among outfielders. Adam Jones is hitting .296 which is good for 16th in the AL, and has also added 20 extra-base hits. His power numbers have been down this season so Jones could have a surge in power coming sometime soon.Orioles fans have seen in the past that it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to vote Orioles players in over the some of the larger market teams. However, with this talented of a roster it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say Baltimore will be well represented regardless. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

06/07/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: MLB Draft Summary for 2014', 'There was less draft enthusiasm for Baltimore Orioles fans this year than in any other in recent memory. This is the cost of signing free agents who had been given the qualifying offer, though O\xe2\x80\x99s fans will say that the early returns on the Nelson Cruz signing seem very much worth this cost. The jury is still out on a final judgment relative to Ubaldo Jimenez.The first selection for the Orioles would not come until the 90th pick overall. Like many other teams, the Birds were shopping for pitching. As with Matt Hobgood in 2009, Dylan Bundy in 2011, and Hunter Harvey in 2013, the Baltimore Orioles would select a pitcher for their first choice (this year in round three). In fact, the first five picks for the Orioles would be pitchers on this day.Round Three \xe2\x80\x93 LHP \xe2\x80\x93 Brian Gonzalez \xe2\x80\x93 Archbishop McCarthy HS, Ft. Lauderdale, FL Gonzalez is 6-1, 230 and throws, at age 18, into the low 90s. He excels as a control specialist as well, being truly more pitcher than raw thrower. Gonzalez comes from an elite program, having former MLB pitcher Alex Fernandez leading the baseball program at his high school.Though Gonzalez has a commitment to the University of Miami, it is believed he is very signable and anxious to begin his pro career.Round Four \xe2\x80\x93 RHP \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0Pat Connaughton\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 Notre DameAs a two sport athlete, Connaughton is also a big part of the basketball program at Notre Dame. A hard thrower, there are certain inconsistencies in his performance that are credited to the lack of singular focus upon baseball. He will be involved in extended baseball activities this summer, will finish one more year of basketball, and then dedicate fully to a baseball career.Round Five \xe2\x80\x93 RHP \xe2\x80\x93 David Hess \xe2\x80\x93 Tennessee TechAs a big power-throwing right-hander, Hess was 10-3 with a 3.24 ERA this year. He is a strikeout pitcher with a collection of plus pitches besides the fastball \xe2\x80\x93 changeup, curve, slider. Though he has another year of eligibility remaining, he will be signing with the Orioles.Round Six \xe2\x80\x93 LHP \xe2\x80\x93 Tanner Scott \xe2\x80\x93 Howard College, TXScott stands 6-2, 220 and was 7-4 with a 2.66 ERA this season. He has committed to Texas Tech, so it is not certain he\xe2\x80\x99ll sign with the Birds.Round Seven \xe2\x80\x93 LHP \xe2\x80\x93 Max Schuh \xe2\x80\x93 UCLA Schuh is a relief pitcher who stands 6-4, 210. He was a part of the UCLA football program as a quarterback, though never played in any games. Schuh posted a 1.55 ERA for the 2014 season.Round Eight \xe2\x80\x93 2B \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Wilkerson \xe2\x80\x93 Clemson A switch-hitting infielder, Wilkerson batted .317 this year with strong power numbers that included six homers. He also possesses good speed.Round Nine \xe2\x80\x93 3B \xe2\x80\x93 Austin Anderson \xe2\x80\x93 U. of Mississippi This left-handed batting infielder is having a great season that is still continuing with the college playoffs. He is hitting in the .330s or so with strong power numbers. He is finishing his senior season and looks ready to move on successfully.Round Ten \xe2\x80\x93 OF \xe2\x80\x93 Jay Gonzalez \xe2\x80\x93 University of Mount Olive, NCThe second Gonzalez selected on the first day of the draft, this one is a different sort of player with great speed and 51 stolen bases. He also batted .425, though it should be noted that this is a Division II school. He has been drafted twice before and also played earlier at Auburn, where he was suspended.Rounds 11-40The remaining rounds of the draft for the Baltimore Orioles were not surprisingly pitcher-dominated. Of these 30 picks, the Birds selected 18 RHPs and 4 LHPs, 2 CFs, 2 RFs, and one each of the four infield positions.An interesting pick for the Orioles was Brandon Bonilla \xe2\x80\x93 the son of former MLB star Bobby Bonilla (who played more than a year for the O\xe2\x80\x99s). They took him in the 25th round. He is a 6-4, 215 pound left-handed pitcher from Grand Canyon University in Phoenix. A power thrower, he has hit as high as 97 mph, while also throwing a splitter and slider.The Orioles selected a local high school right-handed pitcher in the 34th round by taking Garrett Pearson (of St. John\xe2\x80\x99s College HS) who is 6-6, 215. He is from Rockville and has an over-the-top style of delivery \xe2\x80\xa6 fastball only in the mid 80s, but he\xe2\x80\x99s a big guy who can maybe develop.Also of interest is that the Nationals selected Cal Ripken\xe2\x80\x99s son Ryan in the 15th round. The left-hand first baseman had originally gone to the U. of South Carolina, but he transferred to Indian River State College where he posted a .321 average this season. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles drop a game of inches - \\u2026', 'Be it cliche or not, all sports are games of inches. Perhaps this is most evident in football where you need ten yards to get a first down. However baseball is a game of inches also, and often times if you\xe2\x80\x99re off by one inch you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get beat. That can be taken literally or figuratively, but you get the idea. The Baltimore Orioles fell in game one of three to Oakland last night, 4-3 in 11 innings. Orioles fans can take solace in the fact that they battled with one of the best teams in baseball, however there\xe2\x80\x99s little solace in losing.Wei-Yin Chen started out a bit rocky \xe2\x80\x93 or did he? Certainly you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give up solo home runs, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to give up homers it\xe2\x80\x99s best to do it with nobody on base. Josh Donaldson smacked one out in the first inning, and Derek Norris followed suit in the second. That put the O\xe2\x80\x99s in a 2-0 hole, but other than that Chen managed to shut Oakland down. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.1 IP, 5 H, 2 R, 0 BB, 4 K. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s a fly ball pitcher who pitches-to-contact. So in that sense the two homers, zero walks, and only four strikeouts aren\xe2\x80\x99t surprising.This game wasn\xe2\x80\x99t without it\xe2\x80\x99s drama, however. Adam Jones grounded into a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice tCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportso end the third, and Oakland third baseman Josh Donaldson tagged Manny Machado out between second and third. However Machado took exception to what he deemed an overly hard tag, which admittedly sent him sprawling onto his backside. As he fell Machado slammed his helmet into the infield grass, and immediately got up and confronted Donaldson.Both benches and bullpens emptied, however order was quickly restored. My personal opinion was that while Donaldson did seem to go out of his way (and out of the base line) to tag Machado, the tag itself did not appear to be overly harsh.\xc2\xa0Ultimately, Wei-Yin Chen pitched Donaldson inside once and then hit him later in the at-bat later in the game \xe2\x80\x93 more to come, I suppose.Jonathan Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single in the second inning brought the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within 2-1, and Chris Davis tied the score at two in the fourth with a solo homer. Speaking of Manny Machado, he put the Birds in the drivers seat an inning later with a solo home run of his own. This of course followed a gold glove play at the hot corner in which Machado gunned down Derek Norris at first base in the fourth inning. Do we think that the incident with Donaldson didn\xe2\x80\x99t somehow fire Machado up?!With the Baltimore Orioles still leading 3-2, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day walked Coco Crisp to lead off the eighth.  \xe2\x80\x9cNothing good ever happens after a walk.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Rick Dempsey  Following a stolen base, Crisp would score to tie the game at three on a Cespedes RBI-double. J.J. Hardy would commit his fourth error in two days in the 11th, putting runners at the corners for Oakland. John Jaso scored on a Vogt RBI-single to left field, which ended up winning the game for Oakland.It\xe2\x80\x99s a game of inches; if not for that Hardy error perhaps Oakland ends up with runners at first and second and Jaso can\xe2\x80\x99t score on that single. Maybe he scores anyways; we have no way of knowing. If Chen doesn\xe2\x80\x99t miss his mark on one of those two home run pitches by an inch or so, maybe the ball doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave the ballpark. Again, we have no way of knowing.Perhaps the most bizzare play of the night came with two outs in the last of the tenth; the O\xe2\x80\x99s had Cruz at third and Adam Jones at second \xe2\x80\x93 with Chris Davis at the plate. On a two-strike count, Cruz was tagged out trying to steal home. Again, game of inches\xe2\x80\xa6right? A lot of folks had a problem with the attempted steal in that it takes the bat out of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 hands. However keep in mind that lady luck often smiles on daring ones. If nothing else, the Orioles are a pretty conventional team. Yet they play in an age where it seems that the unconventional is what\xe2\x80\x99s winning games. In that situation the last thing anyone would have expected would have been an attempted steal of home plate.Most second-guessing is done in all things based on results. So if Cruz is safe at home (ending the game), nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to say\xc2\xa0why in the world would he do that?\xc2\xa0Here\xe2\x80\x99s another thing; Josh Donaldson appeared to be giving Cruz one heck of a lead at third base. If anything, Cruz might have been able to get down the line further before he actually broke. While it does appear that the decision to steal was Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat opaque at the moment. So let\xe2\x80\x99s say that the steal sign was put on from the bench \xe2\x80\x93 did Oakland pick off that sign by chance?The series continues tonight in a game that will be televised by FOX at 7:15. The Birds had to send starter Miguel Gonzalez to the DL yesterday with soreness, so Kevin Gausman joined the team yesterday and will be activated to make tonight\xe2\x80\x99s start. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s Sonny Black.The Orioles also announced yesterday that Johan Santana\xe2\x80\x99s season is over. In what was to be his final extended-spring game (before being assigned to an affiliate for rehab), Santana tore his achilles tendon fielding a ball off the pitchers mound in Sarasota.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles had just about everyone on the team contribute in some form or fashion to an 11-inning loss to the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s Friday evening.In one sense the series opener was a fascinating game, as multiple, potential game-changing plays were decided by fractions of inches and fractions of seconds. Yet it was terribly frustrating for the Orioles, as most of the close calls went against them.In the end, Oakland pulled out a 4-3 win in 11 innings, wasting a quality start from Wei-Yin Chen who gave up only two runs on solo homers in his 6.1 innings. His pitches had decent movement and excellent velocity.The Baltimore Orioles did come back from a 2-0 deficit to take a 3-2 lead. A trio of singles by J.J. Hardy, Steve Pearce, and Jonathan Schoop scored their first run in the second inning. Chris Davis tied the game with a homer in the fourth, and Manny Machado gave the Birds a lead with a solo shot in the fifth inning. But that would be it for scoing, even though the Orioles did manage 13 hits in the 11 innings.The tying run was given up in uncharacteristic fashion, as Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day walked leadoff hitter Coco Crisp \xe2\x80\x93 a thorn in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 side for what seems like the past 30 years. Crisp would steal second where Yoenis Cespedes would score him on a double into the left-field corner.The best chance for the Orioles to win the game was in the 10th inning. With one out and Nick Markakis on second and Nelson Cruz on first, Adam Jones drove a single into right field. Markakis was thrown out in a play close enough to be challenged \xe2\x80\x93 though unsuccessfully. Should he have been sent with Davis on deck? I think so; it was worth the shot at winning the game. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been very critical of Dickerson\xe2\x80\x99s coaching and choices this year, but it was a legitimate good chance to win the game right there.The next play raises another question. With two out and Nelson Cruz on third base (and two strikes on Davis), Cruz attempted to steal home and was thrown out at the plate. I wrote in May about being at an Orioles game and how, in person, the over-shift against a left-handed pull hitter leaves a runner at third so free to get a huge lead. I opined then that someone should seek to take advantage of this. However, Cruz was actually not that much farther off the base than in a typical situation when he broke for the plate. So I believe the idea was a good one, but it simply was not executed in a way that would yield success.The Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s scored the game-winning running in the top of the 11th off Evan Meek \xe2\x80\x93 who does not seem to have \xe2\x80\x9cplus stuff\xe2\x80\x9d whatsoever these days. John Jaso doubled to lead off the inning on a ball where Adam Jones fell down before fielding and making the throw on a close play at second base.After a strikeout, Albert Callaspo hit a sharp grounder to J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s glove side. Hardy committed his fourth error in two days, as he clearly lifted his head before fielding the ball \xe2\x80\x93 looking to possibly make a play at third, which may well have been successful if he came up with it cleanly. Steven Vogt singled in the go-ahead run, breaking the O\xe2\x80\x99s back \xe2\x80\x93 as Davis, Hardy, and Pearce struck out in order in the bottom of the 11th.Did the difficult travel schedule and odd sleep patterns contribute to the loss? Would the fractional plays have gone the other way with a more rested team? The early season has been a grind if it has been anything, and the Orioles drop to 30-29 while the Jays win yet another game.Weird, weird season!Speaking of weird, another odd moment happened when Manny Machado took severe offense to the way he was tagged out at third base by the A\xe2\x80\x99s Josh Donaldson. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t see why Manny was that angry, as he was trying to get away from the tag and Donaldson was trying to put it on him. Machado fell backwards, throwing his helmet, and standing to get into Donaldson\xe2\x80\x99s face.Apparently Manny saw his own action as \xe2\x80\x9cgiving himself up\xe2\x80\x9d a bit more than Donaldson did, who seemed genuinely shocked that Machado was up in his face. Benches cleared, etc\xe2\x80\xa6 though the whole thing de-escalated quickly.More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterI don\xe2\x80\x99t fault the passion of Manny nor the fire to get into another\xe2\x80\x99s guy\xe2\x80\x99s face, even though I\xe2\x80\x99ve never really seen much of that fervor or attitude in him before. Actually, I like it. I often wish more of the mellow personalities on the Baltimore Orioles displayed more of this aggressiveness. I just think there was more smoke than fire in the actual precipitating incident.Donaldson was hit with an inside pitch by Chen in the top of the sixth inning. Though he threw some equipment in the air in disgust, again, smoke without a fire. It was the eighth pitch of the at-bat and was on a full count. Sometimes toward the end of the day for Chen, he loses his pinpointing abilities. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say he \xe2\x80\x9ctires\xe2\x80\x9d because, of those eight pitches to Donaldson, five were 94 MPH, one was 95 (the final pitch), and one was at 96.All in all, a frustrating loss, and the Orioles need to turn it around today \xe2\x80\xa6 check back for a preview and some other thoughts on the draft and Johan Santana.

They have only failed to sign a pick in the first ten rounds - which are the ones that contribute to the total bonus pool - once in those two years, when 2012\'s fifth round pick Colin Poche went to college at Arkansas instead of signing with the Orioles. 2014 Orioles Draft Picks    Round Player Position School Hometown DOB Height Weight Bats Throws   3 (90) Brian Gonzalez LHP Archbishop McCarthy HS Miramar, FL 10/25/95 6\'1"" 230 R L   4 (121) Pat Connaughton RHP Notre Dame Winchester, MA 1/6/93 6\'5"" 210 R R   5 (151) David Hess RHP Tennessee Tech Tullahoma, TN 7/10/93 6\'2"" 210 R R   6 (181) Tanner Scott LHP Howard College Mogarore, OH 7/22/94 6\'2"" 220 R L   7 (211) Max Schuh LHP UCLA Fresno, CA 3/13/92 6\'4"" 210 L L   8 (241) Steve Wilkerson 2B Clemson Roswell, GA 1/11/92 6\'1"" 185 S R   9 (271) Austin Anderson 3B Ole Miss Sorrento, CA 6/18/92 6\'0"" 200 L R   10 (301) Jay Gonzalez OF Univ. of Mount Olive Orlando, FL 12/11/91 5\'11"" 185 L L   11 (331) John Means LHP West Virginia Olathe, KS 4/24/93 6\'3"" 225 L L   12 (361) Nigel Nootbaar RHP Univ. of Southern California El Segundo, CA 3/24/93 6\'0"" 180 R R   13 (391) Matt Trowbridge LHP Central Michigan Mokena, IL 3/24/93 5\'10"" 225 L L   14 (421) Gerrion Grim RF Jefferson College St. Charles, MO 9/17/93 6\'2"" 190 R R   15 (451) Alejandro Juvier 2B Doral Academy (HS) Miami, FL 1/20/96 6\'1"" 180 L R   16 (481) Tanner Chleborad RHP Washington State Rapid City, SD 11/4/92 6\'5"" 190 R R   17 (511) Jean Cosme RHP Colegio Sagrada Familia (PR) Toa Alta, PR 5/24/96 6\'2"" 155 R R   18 (541) Matthew Grimes RHP Georgia Tech Hoschton, GA 9/4/91 6\'6"" 210 R R   19 (571) Connor Seabold RHP Newport Harbor HS Newport Beach, CA 1/24/96 6\'2"" 175 R R   20 (601) Zach Albin RHP UConn - Avery Point Bethel, CT 6/14/93 6\'2"" 195 R R   21 (631) John McLeod LHP Wake Forest Renton, WA 6/3/92 6\'4"" 220 L L   22 (661) Josh Walker RHP New Mexico Rio Rancho, NM 12/18/91 6\'2"" 175 R R   23 (691) Zeke McGranahan RHP Georgia Gwinnett \xc2\xa0College Durham, NC 1/3/91 6\'4"" 215 R R   24 (721) Lucas Long RHP Univ. of San Diego Minneapolis, MN 10/7/92 6\'0"" 195 R R   25 (751) Brandon Bonilla LHP Grand Canyon Univ.

The amount over $100,000, if any, would count against the bonus pool for a pick from those rounds. Maybe the next great Oriole of the future is somewhere on the above list.

The Athletics won 11-1. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe word has come down from Major League Baseball that Baltimore Orioles third baseman Manny Machado will be suspended for five games for the Sunday afternoon bat throwing incident against the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s. There will also be an undisclosed fine.The announcement was made by Senior Vice President for Standards and Operations for Major League Baseball, Joe Garagiola, Jr.Oakland pitcher Fernando Abad also received an undisclosed fine for throwing at Machado.The entire situation and furor that followed it from all over baseball and the sports world pretty much assured or demanded something of this nature. It all seemed very much out of character for the Manny that we as O\xe2\x80\x99s fans have seen over his brief time in the Bigs. In fact, the primary viewpoint has been to marvel at how well he has handled all that has come to him in such a short time and at such a young age.The appearance is that a lot of \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d has built up in him and it all came out in one small window of time. There is the \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d of the injury and surgery, the winter of recovery and work, and the return that has been a grind without the obvious high-level results of a year ago.So how will the Orioles play without him? Well, one would assume that Ryan Flaherty would take the position for this time with Jonathan Schoop at second base. It is likely that Steve Lombardozzi will also be called up from AAA Norfolk.However, later breaking news is that this will be appealed, and therefore the process would be delayed for any actual suspended time \xe2\x80\x93 whatever amount of time that may be. \xc2\xa0Machado is playing this evening for the Orioles in his normal spot \xe2\x80\x93 second in the order.I will opine that an appeal will not help the situation and Manny\xe2\x80\x99s reputation moving forward \xe2\x80\x93 better to take it and put it behind. Perhaps the much lesser punishment to Abad is a sticking point? The Orioles do lose a player for the duration of the suspension, and that is an issue of course.Frankly, Manny\xe2\x80\x99s play both in the field and at the plate has not been what it was in 2013 nor what it will be in 2015. With Machado in the lineup, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are 18-17, without him they are 14-13. This is manageable; but the Orioles do want to see Manny Machado get back to Manny being Manny \xe2\x80\x93 and that is not a reference to a previous Manny of the dreadlock variety.For an article on previous bat-throwing incidents and punitive actions related to such \xe2\x80\x93 along with a video of Manny reflecting on the situation \xe2\x80\x93 check this article and video from the Baltimore Sun.\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Get to know your Orioles: Kevin Gausman - Camden Chat', ' With the fourth pick in the 2012 draft, the Baltimore Orioles selected the latest in the long line of anointed ""future aces"". This guy they have now, has got all of the tools. His fastball flirts with triple digits. His personality is goofy enough to become the fan favorite. This guy is just the total package, which is why it may be even more heart-breaking if he can\'t make the grade. Bio Name: Kevin John Gausman Number: 39 Born: January 6, 1991 (23 years old) in Centennial, CO Height: 6\'3"" Weight: 190 lbs Drafted: 1st round (4th overall) by the Orioles in 2012 School: Grandview High School (Aurora, CO) Lousiana State University (Baton Rouge, LA) Contract: $502,500 in 2014 (Arbitration: 2017, Free Agent: 2020) Twitter: @KevinGausman Before the Orioles The Colorado native was born to parents Clair and Winifred. Clair is a former teacher and part time Pac-10 football referee. Winifred is a nurse at Porter Hospital in Colorado. Goose also has two older siblings; one brother, one sister, but there is almost nothing about them on the interwebs. His high school days were pretty much what one would expect from a wunderkind like Gasuman. He was an all-state selection twice, an Under Armour All-American and an AFLAC All-American; both in 2009. The guy was a stone cold stud.    At this time he was developing some rituals that have stayed with him. For example, he didn\'t have a locker room at Grandview so he had to get dressed on the go. He says, this led to the way he puts his socks on today. Let\'s just say, it\'s a laborious process. He will put on his right sock and take it off. Water break. He then returns to the sock and puts it on his right foot again. This time it stays on. Water break. Back to the socks where he now puts on his left one and immediately removes it. Water break. Then, he comes back and puts on the second sock. Woo! I don\'t want to know his process for putting on underwear.    Something that was widely publicized, but seems to be a thing of the past now, was his love for powdered donuts. He would have one before a start and then eat four between each inning of his starts. I feel bloated just typing that. However, he says he has kind of gotten away from that. That\'s probably for the better. And the final strange thing he has done in the past, but I am unsure if he does now, is that he began his warmups before an inning by sprinting towards the rubber, jumping, and throwing a fastball towards the catcher. What can ya say, he\'s a pitcher.    After high school he was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the sixth round of the 2010 draft. He declined and, instead, enrolled at Louisiana State University. While at LSU he wowed with his mid-90s fastball and above average off-speed stuff, drawing comparisons to former Oriole, and LSU Tiger, Ben McDonald. Gausman won numerous awards as a member of the Tigers, including a 2012 All-SEC and All-American selection. Another good thing for Gausman to come out of his time in Louisiana is his relationship with his girlfriend, Taylor North. It seems the two have been together for sometime now. She is an LSU cheerleader and is Goose\'s biggest fan. Look to her twitter feed for any off-field Gausman updates as the two are regularly together, even during the season.*    Favorites   Food: Not powdered doughnuts. He actually loves hibachi, not a specific food, but the entire experience of watching the food be cooked right in front of you.  Movie: Napoleon Dynamite  Music: Michael Jackson and Alan Jackson (no relation, in case ya didn\'t know). However, his first ever walk-up song at Aberdeen was ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" by N\'Sync.  Hidden Talent: He is modest and says that he has no other talents. However, this fella did play some saxophone in middle school.  Career if not a baseball player: An historian. Gausman was a history major at LSU and he really likes that show ""Ancient Aliens"" on History Channel.   Vacation Spot: Turks and Caicos Islands  Baseball team growing up: Colorado Rockies   Baseball player: Randy Johnson   What\'s Ahead Everyone saw his stellar outing against Oakland on Saturday night. He went seven strong innings, allowing one run and showcasing his immense potential. However, he has struggled to string positive outings together. At times his fastball looks flat and his offspeed pitches lack any deception. But the Orioles have guaranteed the big righty one more start. He is set to take the hill on Thursday against Toronto, a hot hitting lineup with possibly the best power hitter in the game right now. It is going to be a true test of his mettle. Can he hack it against the big boppers of the AL East? We will soon find out. When it comes down to it, Gausman is definitely one of the top five most talented pitchers on the Orioles roster. If talent directly translated to wins he may even be the ace of the club. But the LSU alum still has a lot to prove. Before the season began, Gausman was tabbed as the X-factor. If he emerges as a fixture in the rotation then the O\'s have a shot to go deep into the postseason. As it sits now, there is more talk about who this team needs rather than who they have, but the powdered donut eating phenom has the power to change that and, make no mistake, he will be the number one starter of this staff soon enough.

Standings The Orioles are at 32-30, second place in the AL East, 5.5 games behind Toronto and one game ahead of the Yankees. Their predicted finish is 83-79. Best Hitter / Worst Hitter Adam Jones led the team, and indeed all of baseball, with a 301 wRC+ this week (.483/.500/.931, 4 HR). He even walked once!  J.J. Hardy didn't look so good though. He posted a 35 wRC+ (.192/.241/.269) and made several errors in the field. Best Pitcher / Worst Pitcher In the rotation, Kevin Gausman put together a great start during his second callup this season. In seven innings he struck out six and walked one, giving up just one run on a solo shot. And this was against a red-hot Oakland team that leads the major leagues un runs scored per game.    In the bullpen, Zach Britton continued his run of success on the year. In three innings he struck out four and walked one. He gave up three hits but no runs. More about him later.    Clutch PA of the Week Against Texas on June 4th, the Orioles entered the top of the sixth tied at 5. Jonathan Schoop singled against Nick Martinez and David Lough walked. Caleb Joseph tried to bunt the runners over, but he bunted back to the pitcher who was able to force Schoop at third base. One out. Ron Washington brought in Aaron Poreda to pitch to Nick Markakis. On the first pitch, Lough and Joseph went for the double steal; Joseph was safe, but Lough was thrown out at third. Two out. Markakis came through, singling into left field to bring Joseph home easily and putting the Orioles up 6-5. The score would stay there for the rest of the game. As a side note, Markakis is doing really well this year, hitting .312/.369/.431 with 6 HR (121 wRC+). Note that offense is down league-wide this year, so Markakis looks better by that comparison. He's relying on his highest BABIP since 2010, which doesn't bode well for his average, but his walk and strikeout rates remain better than average. It's a good sign that he already has six dingers on the year, more than halfway to last year's total of 10 in a little over 1/3 the games. And having his high OBP at the top of the lineup doesn't hurt.    Clutch Relief Appearance of the Week As you might expect, Zach Britton recorded this week's most clutch relief appearance. On June 6th against Oakland, he came into the game in the top of the 9th with the score knotted up at 3. He struck out Brandon Moss and got Alberto Callaspo and Kyle Blanks to ground out. The Orioles couldn't score, so in the 10th, he struck out Nick Punto before giving up a double to Coco Crisp. Jed Lowrie flew out to right field and Josh Donaldson walked to add some intrigue. But Yoenis Cespedes struck out and Orioles fans everywhere applauded (until Evan Meek came in the next inning, that is). For what it's worth, Britton also recorded this week's second-most clutch appearance (June 4th against Texas). He has been so good this year. Upcoming Week The Orioles finish the series against Boston, remain in Baltimore to host the scorching-hot Blue Jays, then begin a quick AL East road trip in Tampa Bay (well, technically St. Petersburg).

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsLooking back now at some of the deals that Baltimore Orioles Vice President of Baseball Operations Dan Duquette did NOT do in the offseason makes him look a bit smarter at this moment.Orioles fans will remember (or should remember) what an offseason of discontent it was until a flurry of moves were made at the very end for Suk-min Yoon, Ubaldo Jimenez, and Nelson Cruz.Beyond this was the criticism for the \xe2\x80\x9csalary dump\xe2\x80\x9d of Jim Johnson with little in return, the embarrassing situation with Grant Balfour, and the non-effort to even speak with Brian Roberts.You might say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re giving Duquette credit for Jimenez? That\xe2\x80\x99s been a disaster!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Well, yes\xe2\x80\xa6 but Cruz has been a bargain \xe2\x80\x93 there\xe2\x80\x99s that! So, let\xe2\x80\x99s break this all down a bit.The Jim Johnson Situation \xe2\x80\x93 The Johnson of 2012 was an awesome asset, contributing as much as anyone to the great playoffs year and Orioles revival. The Johnson of 2013, more than any other single factor, cost the O\xe2\x80\x99s a chance to return to the playoffs.I for one did not grieve his loss whatsoever. But many did, and a few still do. Really? You would want a $10-million guy with a 6.46 ERA and WHIP of 1.986? He is giving up 5.3 walks per nine innings. For perspective, Jimenez is at 5.1.He is a great, nice guy who was a part of the turnaround of the Orioles organization after years of losing. That is now history \xe2\x80\x93 appropriately.The Grant Balfour Situation \xe2\x80\x93 You can\xe2\x80\x99t make up stuff like this. Guess what Balfour\xe2\x80\x99s ERA is right now \xe2\x80\x93 6.46 \xe2\x80\xa6 the same as Johnson in the exact same number of innings and appearances. He has given up the unbelievable number of 7.6 walks per nine innings, though his WHIP is better than Johnson at 1.648.Joe Madden has announced that Balfour is no longer the closer \xe2\x80\xa6 that the team is going to use a closer by committee approach. Sunday, the Mariners scored five runs in the ninth inning off him.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue Call to the PenZach Britton injury update: More forearm pain; sent for MRI FanSided10 things we've learned so far this MLB season FanSidedWhat made baseball fun this week: Aaron Judge digs the long ball FanSidedManny Machado mashes ball over Green Monster (Video) FanSidedDuquette and the Orioles were excoriated in the national sports and baseball press for pulling back on a contract for unspecified medical concerns. Even many O\xe2\x80\x99s fans were critical of Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s handling of it. Would anyone now want Balfour and his $12-million two-year deal?The Brian Roberts Situation \xe2\x80\x93 Roberts ended up signing with the Evil Empire to replace the loss of Robinson Cano with at least a veteran presence. That is a tall order, but it has not really worked out extra well for the Yankees.A leading Yankees blog is calling to throw Roberts overboard. Mike Axisa of River Ave Blues says of Roberts, who is batting .239, \xe2\x80\x9cLike Jeter, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear Roberts isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to provide much with the bat. He had a little hot streak a few weeks ago but even then that only raised him up to a .690 OPS for the season, the highest it\xe2\x80\x99s been since the third game of the year. Unlike Jeter, the Yankees can replace Roberts.\xe2\x80\x9dAxisa also said of Roberts in his article, \xe2\x80\x9cSomehow he\xe2\x80\x99s stayed healthy so far.\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, that is an improvement over the recent past.The combined effort of the varied players at second base for the Orioles through 62 games is at a .248 average \xe2\x80\x93 not awesome, but in total at least as good as what Roberts would have done. And this includes six homers, as compared to two by BRob.The Ubaldo Jimenez Situation \xe2\x80\x93 Actually, this could be called the veteran pitcher situation. In the mix were offseason discussions of getting one of the trio of A.J. Burnett, Bronson Arroyo, or Jimenez.Arroyo is 5-4 with a 4.50 ERA. He has pitched only four more innings than Jimenez, but has given up 14 more hits. Yes, there are far fewer walks. But Arroyo is far from lights out.Burnett is 3-4 with a 4.41 ERA. However, his walks per nine innings are almost as high as Ubaldo\xe2\x80\x99s. And Burnett has a 7.25 ERA over his past six starts.There is no doubt that Jimenez has had a rather poor first two months with the Orioles. Yet at the same time, there is no doubt that his stuff is nasty when commanded well. And that is the problem, for sure. If he can cut down on these walks and repeat his delivery \xe2\x80\x93 which I believe he will at some point \xe2\x80\x93 this is going to be a tough pitcher.Jimenez has vastly more upside potential than the other two options. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure he is worth the price, and I wrote that at the moment it happened \xe2\x80\x93 he is not now, and never has been, a person who can control pitch counts regularly and go deep into games. That was supposed to be the goal of getting a front-line starter \xe2\x80\x93 to obtain an innings-eater pitcher.Buyer\xe2\x80\x99s remorse aside, he will prove to be no worse than the other options and will likely prove to be better. This is the problem of free agent pitchers not named Tanaka.So, all in all, I know it is the thing to do in Baltimore to be critical of Dan Duquette. He is not going to be perfect, but I believe that objectively considered, he has done a decent job with the resources available. "", 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

His altercation with his wife is embarrassing. And he may be guilty of far more than what was shown on that famous Atlantic City video. But let us be realistic. The actual \xe2\x80\x9con paper\xe2\x80\x9d crime is considered pretty small. He will get a small suspension and this whole thing will be done. The \xe2\x80\x9csqueaky clean\xe2\x80\x9d life Ray Rice had before the incident must be put on track, as well as showing that he can run again. That last piece is probably the more difficult.\xe2\x80\x93 The next biggest incident in local sports was Manny Machado and his general attitude and the specific bat-throwing incident. No, \xc2\xa0he was not arrested like the others on the list, but the light is shown just as bright for an on-the-field incident, maybe even brighter. Sure his attitude has been poor, but we also tend to blame baseball players for not showing enough emotion. The Orioles just need to get him to tone it back and all is good. Let him use the five games off a time for reflection and to rest for the season ahead.\xe2\x80\x93 It is always troubling to see a Ravens player arrested. It is even more troubling to see a promising rookie who has not even played a game yet get arrested.\xc2\xa0Lorenzo Taliaferro is still to be considered innocent for the taxi window smashing incident. He may not even make the team as no one has seen him in a real game situation. So just hold on for this one.\xe2\x80\x93 Aside from Ray Rice, the most troubling of all the player problems has been\xc2\xa0Jah Reid\xe2\x80\x98s\xc2\xa0two misdemeanor counts of battery following an altercation at a strip club in Key West, Fla. He still has an upcoming June 13 court date. Seen as already being on the bubble, Reid chose poorly during this incident.

Nothing good happens there.\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0Deonte Thompson had been arrested and charged\xc2\xa0with felony possession of marijuana back in February.

He had gotten annoyed at strike calls more and more often, which shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be news to anyone paying attention.Friday night\xe2\x80\x99s incident in which he tumbled backward after being tagged out in the baseline, then bounced up and vented his displeasure with Josh Donaldson for tagging him too hard, was the start of a feisty weekend. The tag was not out of the ordinary and was not that hard, no harder than it needed to be. Machado fell backwards mostly of his own momentum from evading the tag.It sparked one of those Dancing With The Stars-like gatherings of both dugouts, with no punches thrown.  It sparked one of those Dancing With The Stars-like gatherings of both dugouts and bullpens, with no punches thrown. But Machado brought a little Showtime back on Sunday, hitting catcher Derek Norris in the head without turning to show him concern.Next thing you know, Machado comes up in the 8th, and Fernando Abad pitcher throws at Machado\xe2\x80\x99s knees twice. It\xe2\x80\x99s debatable whether the catcher called for those\xc2\xa0pitches, or the pitcher decided on his own to throw them.The second\xc2\xa0pitch brought more theatrics, as\xc2\xa0Machado swung with the ball already in the catcher\xe2\x80\x99s mitt, and the bat flew past third base. It\xe2\x80\x99s anybody\xe2\x80\x99s guess if he was aiming at the pitcher or Donaldson. But he should never have thrown the bat. You never do that.Monday brought a recorded apology\xc2\xa0from Machado on MASN, which\xc2\xa0gave him a forum\xc2\xa0on the team-owned cable channel without allowing questions from any other media members, thus spawning a controversy of its own.\xc2\xa0His 5-game suspension and accompanying fine (of an undisclosed amount) were the expected decision from MLB.It would be folly\xc2\xa0to think it\xe2\x80\x99s over. Machado has\xc2\xa0appealed. He\xc2\xa0already hit Boston catcher A.J. Pierzynski with his backswing again Tuesday night, leading one to believe\xc2\xa0it will probably happen again. This time he appeared to ask Pierzynski if he was okay, though, and no sparks flew.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 For much of the season, Baltimore Orioles starter Chris Tillman has avoided defeat in games in which he was terribly ineffective.So Tillman had no reason to complain after one of his finest performances of the season produced his first loss in nearly a month.Pitching through two rain delays, Tillman allowed only seven singles over six innings in a 1-0 defeat Tuesday night.In his previous start, Tillman gave up five runs and got only three outs yet didn\'t figure in the decision. During his winless run, the right-hander yielded six runs in one outing and eight in another, yet didn\'t take the loss.His run of luck took a turn in his one, when Tillman (5-3) was outpitched by Brandon Workman.Workman (1-0) gave up one hit in 6 1-3 innings, walked one and struck out four to earn his first win as a starter since last July. The right-hander held the Orioles hitless until Ryan Flaherty lined a soft single to center with two outs in the sixth.Baltimore\'s only other hit was a single by Steve Pearce in the ninth off Koji Uehara, who earned his 13th save.And Tillman? Well, he was better than last time but just not quite good enough in absorbing his first loss in five starts since May 11.""Yeah, I was able to executive pitches when I needed to when I got into trouble,"" he said. ""Later in the game I was executing most of my pitches. So it was good to see it coming. Especially felt better as I went, so that\'s promising.""Manny Machado started at third base for the Orioles despite receiving a five-game suspension and a fine for intentionally throwing his bat in Sunday\'s game against Oakland. Machado appealed the suspension, batted second and went 0 for 4, making the final out on a strikeout.Both rain delays occurred in second inning. The first stoppage took 15 minutes; the second lasted 1:18.Tillman got off to a rocky start following the second delay. Brock Holt led off the third with a single, David Ortiz walked and Mike Napoli delivered a two-out, opposite-field RBI single to right.""Unfortunate, because the run he gave up was on a flare to right,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""He didn\'t give up many hard-hit balls.""Boston used three straight singles to load the bases with no outs in the fourth. Tillman struck out Holt, then got Xander Bogaerts to bounce into a 6-4-3 double play.Over the first four innings, the Red Sox had seven hits and three walks but scored only the one run after stranding seven and hitting into two double plays.It didn\'t matter, because Workman was that good.He retired the first 13 batters before Nelson Cruz drew a walk. J.J. Hardy followed with a popup to second base, and Cruz apparently lost track of the ball or outs in the inning. He took off for second and was easily doubled up.""It\'s no excuse,"" Cruz said. ""I should know better. It shouldn\'t have happened.""Workman will have a hearing Friday on his appeal of a six-game suspension. He was suspended after the league determined he was intentionally throwing in the ""head area"" of Tampa Bay\'s Evan Longoria on May 30.If this was his last outing for a while, he sure went out in style. After retiring Nick Markakis to end the sixth inning, Workman got two straight outs in the seventh before being lifted.It was the longest outing of a 27-game career that includes seven starts.""He was outstanding, especially in light of the two different rain delays,"" Boston manager John Farrell said. ""He was able to stay loose with a couple of almost simulated innings in the batting cage.""NOTES: Red Sox GM Ben Cherington said before the game that an overhaul of the roster is not yet necessary for the struggling team. ""I\'m betting on the players we have in there,"" he said. ... Holt extended his hitting streak to a career-high 10 games. ... Wei-Yin Chen makes his 10th career start against the Red Sox in the series finale Wednesday night. He\'s 3-3 with a 5.26 ERA. Rubby De La Rosa will start for Boston. ...

06/13/2014,"[(""Orioles can't overcome five walks by Ubaldo Jimenez, or ..."", "" When I was a little kid, my parents would take me to the zoo in Baltimore. As we made our way through the various zoo exhibits, we would invariably end the day by going through the hippo house. It is the worst thing I have ever smelled, an enclosed space where the stench of hippos permeated completely. There was no skipping the trip in to the hippo house, because where else are you going to be in close proximity to a hippopotamus? You have to see the hippos while you can. I mention all of this tonight because Ubaldo Jimenez is the pitching equivalent of hippopotamus shit. Sometimes I might go into the hippopotamus house and not be as offended by the smell as my worst memory, but still, at all times, I was fully aware that I was being buffeted by the smell of hippo in a controlled environment. In much the same way, there are days where you can watch Jimenez and he's less terrible than the worst you've seen him, but you still can't escape the basic fact that he is what he is. The big difference between the hippopotamus and Jimenez is that the hippo is this exotic creature from a distant, not-easily-accessible ecosystem, where Jimenez is just a pitcher who looks terrible. We have seen plenty of those pitchers and we do not care to see more. The Orioles lost Friday's game to the Blue Jays by a 4-0 score. They were never in the game, would never be in the game. The hitters turned in one of their trademark pathetic performances, this time against Jays starter Drew Hutchison. And then, on the other hand ... Jimenez.    If you didn't watch him, if you're only checking the box score, you might not be aware of how bad he looked. If you saw those hippos through glass, you would not know the smell, either. Jimenez only gave up two runs in six innings, which is, on a results-based level, not so bad. That is a quality start, and it is not the bare minimum, 4.50 ERA.    The reason for that is that Ubaldo is a lucky man. He plays on the team that has turned more double plays than any other team in baseball. With guys like Jimenez pitching, they get plenty of chances with a man on first. They turned two in support of Jimenez tonight. This is the kind of thing you need to happen when your starting pitcher walks five batters in six innings. How does that even happen? The Orioles hitters are lucky to get five walks in 60 innings. They had no walks tonight. It was the fourth start of the season where Jimenez has walked five batters. You have to work to get that outcome.    In retrospect, the game was over after Juan Francisco homered off Jimenez in the second inning, immediately following a one-out walk to Brett Lawrie. The Orioles never scored in the game, so 2-0 would have held for the night. More on that in a minute. Right after giving up that home run, Jimenez walked the next batter. Why does he hate us? The defense bailed him out with one of the double plays, but the damage was done. Jimenez gave up only three hits in his six innings. The five free passes hurt. Even when a good-hitting team like the Jays swings at Jimenez's offerings, they had a hard time putting it safely in play. It's just, the free passes. They hurt. As for the Orioles hitters, well, you're probably going to lose most of the time when you go 1-11 with runners in scoring position, which is precisely what they did tonight. The lone hit with RISP was an infield single by Manny Machado. No runs were coming in from second on that play. In a particularly frustrating sequence in the seventh inning, J.J. Hardy led off with a double and never advanced. Machado and Jonathan Schoop flew out by hacking at garbage on the first pitch. It hurts so much.    Adding to the night's misfortune was an appearance by Tommy Hunter, who was determined to show why he was kicked out of the closing role. Actually, he got one scoreless inning, but then came out for the next one and things did not go so well. Hunter issued a walk to Anthony Gose, who ended up on third after Hunter could not field a grounder by Jose Reyes. The error on the play actually was charged to Schoop, who couldn't field Hunter's half-hearted deflection, but whatever. Gose scored on a wild pitch, which moved Reyes up to second. Reyes moved up to third on a groundout, in position to easily score when Jose Bautista floated a single to center. That gets us to our 4-0 final score. The best scoring chance for the Orioles came in the fourth inning. Adam Jones led off with a single and moved up a base on a groundout. Unfortunately, Jones then delivered a TOOTBLAN (thrown out on the basepath like a nincompoop), taking off for third on a grounder to shortstop. Reyes threw to third, where Jones was tagged out. Maybe if he was on third, then Hardy would have still singled and scored him. Instead, the Orioles got nothing. Four Orioles batters had multi-hit games, including a three-hit effort by Machado, and two-hit games by Hardy, Jones, and Steve Pearce. Every time Pearce plays, you wonder why he doesn't play more. The problem for the Orioles was that every other Oriole had a no-hit game. That's a good recipe for getting shut out. The series is even up at one game apiece. They continue Saturday afternoon at 4:05, with Bud Norris starting for the Orioles against R.A. Dickey of the Jays. A plague fell upon the Orioles knuckleballers on Friday, with minor leaguer Eddie Gamboa being suspended 50 games for a positive PED test, and UMBC product Zach Clark being released. Maybe some of that bad knuckleballer juju will mean a poor performance for Dickey.    Please exit through the gift shop. A portion of the proceeds from every sale will go towards the preservation of good starting pitchers in their natural habitat.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Dickey. They are both starting to hit again, which should help balance the offense.The Orioles scored only three runs, which is one short of my definition of a complete team win. The team went 1-for-7 with runners in scoring position, which resulted in missed opportunities.The Orioles are first in the American League and second in all of MLB in hitting with runners in scoring position at .281.When given the chance to score, the Orioles are able to drive in the runs, but the problem is the chances do not come.Small ball is something the Orioles do not play very much. When a player is on first base, the Orioles have 109 strikeouts, which is fourth most in the AL.When breaking down the stats to individual scenarios, the Orioles are batting .403 when there are runners on the corners. Third base is in scoring position, so this distorts the RISP stat with this high average.With runners on first and second base, the average drops to a shocking .150. The Orioles appear to have a good average with RISP, but the high number comes from being able to bring in runners from third base.This is not a bad thing, but the Orioles need to improve their numbers with men on second and third.The Orioles bat .245 when there are RISP with two outs. Even the stats show the Orioles to be inconsistent when it comes to the offense.With the offensive inconsistency, I am surprised the pitching has been able to remain consistent even over this stretch. The pitching has to come into every game not knowing if the offense will give them any support. The pitching has to come into every game not knowing if the offense will give them any support.It must be mentally taxing for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers to have to play like that.Unless the offense can provide some consistency, I am not sure how much longer the Orioles can pretend to be chasing the Blue Jays for first place.When the pitchers provide a quality start, the offense needs to come through with the magic number of four runs. Otherwise, the pitching is not always going to be as sharp as it has been the past six games.In the final game of the series and the homestand, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense will not bat against a pitcher they have had much success against.The Orioles have combined for 6-for-31, while scoring only two runs against Blue Jays\xe2\x80\x99 pitcher J.A. Happ, since the beginning of the 2013 season.The offense will try to support Chris Tillman who comes off a great outing against the Boston Red Sox in which he allowed only one run, but took the loss.

""We\'re playing some good teams. That\'s the beauty of it. The competitive level is rising and it\'s fun to see.""Tillman (5-4) allowed three runs and eight hits in seven innings. He\'s 0-4 with a 2.78 ERA at home and 5-0 with a 6.33 ERA on the road.""That\'s how it goes in baseball,"" Jones said. ""He threw the ball well today. Unfortunately, we were unable to score him some runs. We had a couple opportunities, but he can only do what he can control. Today he went out there and gave us everything he had.""Tillman didn\'t issue a walk or record a strikeout.""I\'m trying to make these guys put the ball in play as soon as possible,"" the right-hander said. ""If that\'s the way the way it\'s going to be, fine. I\'m going to take it.""Nelson Cruz had three hits and his major league-leading 56th RBI for the Orioles, who are 17-11 against division foes.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Nick Swisher homers in 11th; Indians top Red Sox 3-2J.A.

We made some good plays, we got some clutch hitting,"" Toronto slugger Jose Bautista said. ""A series split on the road against the second-place team is something to not be too upset about.""Edwin Encarnacion also had three hits for the Blue Jays, who had totaled 15 runs in losing six of their previous eight games. Led by Navarro, Toronto banged out 12 hits against Tillman and two relievers.Navarro had two doubles and a single.""I know people to expect the runs to come from the big boys,"" he said. ""You cannot always depend on the big dogs. You can count on the little guys sometimes.""Happ (6-3) gave up one run, seven hits and no walks in six-plus innings. He had lost two of his previous three starts, yielding 12 earned runs over 17 2-3 innings.""Happ was outstanding, he really was,"" manager John Gibbons said.

After Encarnacion doubled, Navarro blooped an RBI single to left field for a 2-0 lead.In the Toronto fifth, Anthony Gose snapped a 5-for-38 skid with a leadoff single, advanced on a double by Jose Reyes and scored on a fly ball by Melky Cabrera.Baltimore closed to 3-1 in the sixth when Jones hit a two-out double and Cruz singled him home.NOTES: It was the first time since May 27, 2010, against Oakland that Baltimore pitchers did not record a single strikeout. ...

Tonight was one of those nights, as he was brought in retire a left-handed pinch hitter in the eighth inning of a tie game. Once he came in, Rays manager Joe Maddon pinch hit for the pinch hitter, someone named Jerry Sands. Sands only had 11 plate appearances coming into the game, but he's a right-handed hitter. Because he is a right-handed hitter, he beat Matusz with a two-run home run to give the Rays a 5-3 lead. With only three outs to go, it was enough for the Rays, who won 5-4. Of course, it wasn't only Matusz who is to blame for the loss. There is never one player as we all know. If the offense had been able to get to starting pitcher Jake Odorizzi for more than two runs, the Matusz meltdown may never have had happened. If David Lough hadn't bunted J.J. Hardy to second base in the seventh inning to put him in scoring position for Ryan Flaherty and Caleb Joseph, who knows how the inning would have turned out. If Nelson Cruz could have managed more than an infield single in the eighth inning, or Steve Pearce's line drive to left field had been a foot to the right, the Orioles might have walked away with a win. But what we'll remember is Matusz, who is so awful at pitching to righties that he couldn't even retire a fella named Jerry Sands. Sands, a 26 year old with 77 career games in the majors but only 16 since 2011, got the best of Matusz. In his career, right-handed hitters .304/.370/.490 against Matusz. This year, despite years of data working against him, Matusz has somehow faced more righties than lefties, and those righties are OPS'ing .875. He's now given up 16 hits to right-handed batters, and 9 of them have gone for extra bases. So how is this allowed to happen? In some instances, Matusz has given up hits to righties that get hits off of everyone. Hitters like Andrew McCutchen and Dustin Pedroia, for example. Why is he ever allowed to face those guys? But he's also given up hits to Robinson Chirinos and Dioner Navarro and, now, Jerry Sands. And if he can't get out hitters like that, why is he on the team? I'm being harsh on Matusz, and possibly unfair. But it's very frustrating to know that any team with a righty on the bench can throw him up against Matusz and completely take away any advantage the Orioles were trying to get by bringing him into the game in the first place.    The underwhelming offense and blow up by Matusz overshadow the fact that the starting pitcher Wei-Yin Chen added to the O's run of quality starts, which now stands at eight. It was a classic Chen start, really. He gave up three runs on two home runs and walked only one, with a pitch count jacked up due to approximately 500 foul balls against him. He got through 6 2/3 innings, though, and kept his team in the game long enough for them to come back. And they did come back, once! Down 3-0 in the top of the sixth inning, Nick Markakis doubled ahead of Adam Jones, who hit his 12th home run of the year. The game was tied in the eighth when the Orioles loaded the bases with one out, but could only score one run on an RBI infield single from Cruz. Neither Hardy nor the pinch-hitting Pearce could knock in any more, though, squashing the rally. Pearce nearly had a bases-clearing double, but it hit just a little bit foul in left field, and he ended up grounding out to end the inning. After Brian Matusz happened, pinch hitter Delmon Young homered in the top of the 9th with one out. That made the score 5-4, but Markakis and Manny Machado both popped out to end the game.    The loss gives the Orioles a record of 35-34, and they fell 1/2 game behind the idle Yankees to fall into third place. They are back in action tomorrow with Miguel Gonzalez returning form the disabled list to face former Oriole Erik Bedard.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
06/17/2014,"[('Orioles Lose Game of Inches, and Matt Wieters', 'Jun 16, 2014; St. Petersburg, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Steve Pearce (28) breaks his bat after he hit during the eighth inning at Tropicana Field. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsIt is always said that baseball is a game of inches, and various plays for the Orioles in their 5-4 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays illustrated this truth on Monday night.After falling behind 3-0, but then recovering to tie the game at 3-3, the Orioles had a chance in the top of the eighth inning to break into the lead. Nelson Cruz had just tied the game with a bases-loaded Baltimore chop single, and Steve Pearce came in to pinch hit for David Lough. His line drive into the left-field corner went foul by inches before hopping over the wall. That would have been two runs and I\xe2\x80\x99d be writing about something different today \xe2\x80\x93 probably how clutch Peace is.And of course, every at-bat involves inches. Brian Matusz, who has been so good at stranding inherited runners, came on in the bottom of the eighth inning; and facing that power threat Jerry Sands, Matusz allowed a fastball too far over the plate. It of course went too far over the wall, scoring O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s leadoff walk and providing the eventual margin of victory. Delmon Young continued to add to the his case for getting more playing time by homering in the ninth as a pinch hitter.It is sort of anti-climatic to finally get the news that Matt Wieters is out for the season and having Tommy John surgery on the day this article is posting (June 17).\xc2\xa0 It is interesting to read how the recovery for a non-pitcher is shorter, which makes sense I guess.\xc2\xa0Without Wieters in the lineup at all the O\xe2\x80\x99s are 19-24.So just how valuable is Wieters to the Orioles? This may not be the whole story, but the fact is that they were 12-10 in games with Wieters as catcher, and they were 4-0 with him at DH. Without him in the lineup at all the O\xe2\x80\x99s are 19-24. It is sad that this happened after Matt had his best start ever in any season of his career.I was very interested in seeing Caleb Joseph getting a chance at last to make the majors and play. But it was pretty clear that the Orioles organization did not really believe that he could handle the defensive side of things sufficiently. But as just one more evidence of 2014 being an entirely upside-down season, Joseph has played great defense but looks often over-powered at the plate.But Joseph is not the only O\xe2\x80\x99s player looking overpowered and over-matched. Honestly, Chris Davis does in many at-bats. Frequently the ball is past him when he is swinging. In the spirit of the late Tony Gwynn \xe2\x80\x93 the most amazing hitting machine you\xe2\x80\x99d just about ever see (for those of you not old enough to remember) \xe2\x80\x93 he used a light bat to have total control and place the ball wherever he desired. Perhaps the time has come for Davis to drop a few ounces in his bat selection in order to have greater control.And could someone please tell J.J. Hardy to get up on the plate a bit more? He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cover the outside well and is often beaten on the corners of the zone.And again, in more \xe2\x80\x9cother news,\xe2\x80\x9d Clay Rapada is back with the organization and will report to AAA Norfolk. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say. If nothing else, he at least adds to the average size of Orioles pitchers.Tonight the Orioles will see the return of Miguel Gonzalez after a short time on the DL. There have been eight consecutive quality starts by O\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers. Can he keep it going?The Orioles will be facing their old \xe2\x80\x9cfriend\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mr. Personality himself, Eric Bedard. He is 3-4 with a 3.55 ERA. His seasonal game log looks a bit like Chris Tillman, in that he either has it together for a game or he gets hit pretty hard. Three of the last four games have been of the latter variety; however, in the five games prior to that he only gave up three runs over 28 innings.It is too painful to even imagine Bedard shutting down the Orioles and dropping them to .500, though honestly, right now that is what the Orioles essentially are \xe2\x80\x93 a .500 team with the untapped potential to be much, much better. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), (""Get to know your Orioles: Darren O'Day - Camden Chat"", ' A solid middle relief pitcher may be the most under-appreciated player on a Major League baseball team. For the Orioles, they may have one of the best in the game. His goofy personality, and on going competition with Tommy Hunter to see who can catch the most home run balls, has endeared him to fans. Bio Name: Darren Christopher O\'Day\xc2\xa0Number: 56Born: October 22, 1982 (31 years old) in Jacksonville, FLHeight: 6\'4""\xc2\xa0Weight: 220 lbsBats: Right\xc2\xa0Throws: RightDrafted: Undrafted, signed with Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim as an amateur free agentSchool: Bishop Kenney High School (Jacksonville, FL)University of Florida (Gainesville, FL)Contract: $3,200,000 in 2014 ($4,250,000 team option for 2015, $400,000 buyout)Became an Oriole: Selected off waivers from the Texas Rangers on November 2, 2011Walk-up music: ""Thickfreakness"" by the Black KeysTwitter: @DODay56 Personal It\'s pretty surprising to discover that a man named O\'Day is not Irish. In fact, according to an article in\xc2\xa0the Baltimore Sun last year, he is actually Polish. About forty years ago Darren\'s father, Ralph, and one of his uncles legally changed their name from Odachowski to O\'Day. It was done as a tribute to their mother, Darren\'s grandmother. She was left as a widow with three sons after her husband died in a car accident when Ralph was 13 years old. To make ends meet and put all of her boys through college she worked long hours. At work, it made things easier for her to shorten her name to Odach; the ""ch"" was silent so it sounded like what we\xc2\xa0pronounce\xc2\xa0now as ""O\'Day"".    To this day, Darren still has ""D. Odachowski"" stiched into the glove he uses in games.    Fast forward about thirty years when young Darren was going from high school to college. He was a good baseball player and always had a passion for it. He was no star, though. He only played varsity baseball his junior and senior years; not a four-year phenom. But still, some smaller schools had shone interest. He decided to go with his lofty academic expectations and attended the University of Florida, hoping for the best with baseball. His freshman year he tried out for the Gators as a walk-on and was cut. It was a bummer for O\'Day but he was looking towards a future in medicine. He was an animal science major and would later decide that he wanted to pursue a career as a plastic surgeon.    However, before giving up baseball forever he played in an adult baseball league with some friends. There, he showed off his new side-arm pitching motion. He mixed it in with his regular over-the-top delivery and had some success. The new motion plus extra time in the gym led to some increased velocity and he gave the Gators baseball team another go. This time, he struck out all of the walk-on hitters he faced and made the team, going on to pitch for four years and even earning a scholarship. While at Florida, O\'Day met his future wife, and fellow UF alum, Elizabeth Prann. She was a journalism student and a member of the women\'s club lacrosse team. Now, many may be familiar with her as a reporter for FOX News, making her the more famous one in the couple. The two were married on November 20, 2010 in Atlanta, GA.    After college, O\'Day toyed with the idea of leaving baseball behind once again and pursuing medical school. His grades were good enough to get in just about anywhere and Major League organizations weren\'t exactly knocking his door down. He went undrafted as a fifth year senior and his biggest suitor was former big leaguer Casey Kotchman\'s dad, Tom. He was a scout for the Angels. It would take some convincing. O\'Day spoke with Dr. John Poser, a former All-Big Ten pitcher for Wisconsin. Poser had been in O\'Day\'s position. He let his father convince him to stick with medicine. In turn, Poser told O\'Day to give baseball one more chance. So with that, and a $20,000 signing bonus, O\'Day became a member of the Angels organization. From there, his climb to the majors began and it was fast. It took three seasons before he made his debut with the Angels in 2008. That year, he made 30 appearances and pitched to a 4.57 ERA before tearing his shoulder in September and being removed from Anaheim\'s 40-man roster. That December he was selected in the Rule Five draft by the New York Mets. Hours before O\'Day made his debut for the Mets, he received word that a good friend of his in the Angels organization, Nick Adenhart, had been killed in a car accident involving a drunk driver. Several days after that, the Mets took him off of their 40-man roster and he was claimed by the Texas Rangers. He met the team in Toronto and, upon arriving at the Rogers Centre, he learned that they didn\'t have a jersey for him so he had to\xc2\xa0wear Kason Gabbard\'s jersey. The jersey wasn\'t lucky and O\'Day gave up a walk off single to Kevin Millar.    The Rangers then headed to Baltimore. After landing, Darren rented a car and drove to Adenhart\'s grave in Williamsport, PA. As a sign of respect, O\'Day writes Adenhart\'s initials on each of his hats worn in the game. After a few years of great perfomance, he caught the injury bug and couldn\'t stay off the DL. The Rangers placed him on waivers, the Orioles picked him up and the rest, as they say, is history.

For example, he pre-ordered the original iPad when he was with the Rangers. To mess with him, fellow reliver Darren Oliver stole the package before O\'Day received it and hid it from him. - In high school, O\'Day and his friends thought it would be funny if one of them hid in the trunk of their car. Then, they would drive down the road, stop, and have that friend jump out of the car to make it seem like a kidnapping. Unfortunately for them, a lady saw this plan in action and called the police with O\'Day\'s license plate number. The cops went to O\'Day\'s home, but nothing serious needed to be done. - At the University of Florida, O\'Day was convinced by his then-girlfriend, Prann, and the women\'s club lacrosse team to don a lacrosse uniform, including the skirt all of the girls have to wear.

The bottom of the order also provided some hits, with Manny Machado, Caleb Joseph and Jonathan Schoop each getting hits, and Schoop and Joseph each scoring.Speaking of Machado, he did a really good job defensively on Tuesday, including turning a double play.

This is exactly the sort of game you might think they will lose if only because they keep showing us they are a .500 team. But, they should still be better than the last place Rays, even so. Right? It's just that they get mysteriously shut down by pitchers who are awful this year like Jake Odorizzi. It's not mysterious. This happens because their approach collectively sucks.

Once what passed for an ace on some awful Orioles teams, Bedard has bounced around since being shipped to Seattle in that highway robbery. Velocity that peaked as high as an average of 92.6mph on his fastball is now down to 88.7 this year. He throws a cutter now. Whenever I hear about pitchers picking up a cutter, I think about Chris Tillman (part of that Bedard trade) trying to add a cutter to sacrifice velocity for movement and control. He got no movement and had no control. It all seems to work out better for Bedard, who is getting non-terrible results on a thus far terrible baseball team. He gets fewer ground balls than ever and yet is giving up fewer home runs than ever. Inducing weak contact, or one hell of a lot of luck? Maybe the difference is pitching at the Trop. Batters have a .219/.305/.289 against Bedard in 29 innings at the Trop this year. That is sub-Flahertian.    RHP Miguel Gonzalez, Orioles2014: 11 G, 58.1 IP, 4.17 ERA, 50 SO, 21 BB, .261 BAA, 1.37 WHIPLast start (at Astros): 6.2 IP, 5 H, 2 ER, 2 BB, 4 SO This is Gonzalez's first start after a trip to the disabled list for an oblique injury. I hate oblique injuries for Orioles players because it feels like they ruin everything. Maybe that's not true. Significantly for Orioles starters, they are working on a streak of eight straight quality starts in a row, which is the longest since they had nine straight between the end of the 2010 season and the start of the 2011 season. The Orioles are 4-4 in those eight games. That is stupid. It also shows that quality starts don't mean all that much as far as the team winning games if other areas of the team are full of failure, like batters and Brian Matusz. Still, it's better to get a quality start from your starter than not.    Gonzalez faced the Rays earlier this season, giving up no runs over five innings.

That was your #2 batter yesterday, and now he's batting seventh. Well, one reason might be that Bedard is left-handed, and Machado bats .204/.235/.306 this year against LHP. Of course, Machado only bats .248/.308/.356 against righties this year, so like... don't bat him second against anybody.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsYesterday\xe2\x80\x99s headline for the Baltimore Orioles and Tampa Bay Rays game from Monday night proclaimed that the O\xe2\x80\x99s lost a game of inches. Indeed, a bases-loaded line drive into the left-field corner by Steve Pearce went foul by a small margin. It would have been the difference in the outcome of the game.On Tuesday evening, a long fly by Chris Davis with the sacks jammed remained fair by inches, hitting the pole about 10 feet high and scoring four runs in one swing \xe2\x80\x93 even if it was delayed until a replay clarified what had happened.And Steve Pearce was able to provide the margin of victory in this game, hitting a two-run homer in the top of the seventh inning and adding what would prove to be the gap for the final score of 7-5.The two O\xe2\x80\x99s homers would make a winner out of Miguel Gonzalez and a loser of Eric Bedard. Gonzalez gave up two homers of his own, but both were third inning solo shots by Sean Rodriguez and Desmond Jennings.The win was a critical one for the Baltimore Orioles, avoiding a fall to .500 while also picking up a game on the Blue Jays \xe2\x80\x93 who were beaten by the Yankees. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterThe final series game this afternoon in Florida will match Kevin Gausman against Alex Cobb.

He told news outlets today that surgery was inevitable. He will begin the rehab process very soon in Atlanta, and he projects to be back in time for Opening Day next season.During Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 career, scouts have said he is the one player the Orioles can\xe2\x80\x99t lose. The team was 6-12 in its first few weeks without him, and overall, 17-20 without him as of the end of the Tampa Bay series. But in the Major Leagues, they don\xe2\x80\x99t cry about these things, they just decide on solutions and move forward.A combination of\xc2\xa0Nick Hundley\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Caleb Joseph\xc2\xa0keeps doing the best it can, with Joseph proving the better of the two defensively thus far and that fact earning him more playing time. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 recent stretch of 11\xc2\xa0quality starts in the last 13 games, and their 3.54 team ERA over the last two weeks, are testimony to Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s defense and game-calling skills, even though the club is still just 13-13 in its last 26 games. The team ERA is a less-than-thrilling 4.11 going back 28 days, according to\xc2\xa0baseball-reference.comSome days they look great, and some days they do at least one thing to\xc2\xa0shoot themselves in the foot somehow or other. The last two wins over Tampa Bay were an example of the former. Tuesday night, Miguel Gonzales almost gave back a 5-2 lead, but\xc2\xa0Steve Pearce\xc2\xa0came through with a late homer to pad the lead and provide the final margin. Today brought a gem of a combined pitching performance, from\xc2\xa0Kevin Gausman, to a hopefully revitalized\xc2\xa0Tommy Hunter, to a rock-solid\xc2\xa0Zach Britton.Gausman has a .95 ERA since joining the team June 7This was Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s (3-1) third fine outing in a row, and his escape from a bases loaded pickle in the first inning showed another step in his growth: How to recover\xc2\xa0when his pitches are getting squeezed. He has a .95 ERA since June 7, allowing two earned runs in 19 innings over that span. He got out of the first\xc2\xa0without giving up a run, and threw five more shutout innings before Hunter took over and retired six straight, easing a lot of worries over his more recent appearances.Britton was his usual, efficient self, finishing the Rays off 1-2-3 in the ninth, including two strikeouts. He\xe2\x80\x99ll go into this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s series at Yankee Stadium with tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s off day in which to rest. His saves have been so efficiently pitched that one off-day should give him enough rest.Crying isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only thing people don\xe2\x80\x99t do in the Major Leagues.

The Hall of Fame outfielder believed he developed cancer because of his years-long habit of using spit tobacco, although that was never medically confirmed.Whether Gwynn\'s untimely death and his stance against smokeless tobacco will curtail its use among players remains an open question.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Nightengale: Tony Gwynn was truly the greatestResearch by the Pro Baseball Athletic Trainers Society revealed the number of major leaguers who use spit tobacco has declined from about 50% to 33% in the last 20 years.However, that\'s still about 10 times the amount in the general population, according to the American Cancer Society, whose data from 2012 showed 3.5% of Americans 12 and older \xe2\x80\x93 or 9 million \xe2\x80\x93 use the highly addictive product.""It\'s definitely ingrained and something that\'s part of our baseball culture, but it\'s not exclusive to baseball,\'\' said Oakland Athletics first baseman Brandon Moss, a non-user. ""You would hope a figure like (Gwynn), something tragic like that happening, would be a wake-up call for everyone, not just those in baseball. \xe2\x80\xa6 But most guys are probably going to look at it as the loss of a great man and a great baseball player and leave it at that.\'\'Indeed, the stance among players seems to be that they\'re aware of the dangers but, like smoking, it\'s up to every individual to decide whether to use what remains a legal product.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Tony Gwynn was the purest hitter of an impure eraThe National Cancer Institute says in its website that smokeless tobacco contains at least 28 chemicals that have been found to cause cancer \xe2\x80\x93 typically of the mouth, esophagus and pancreas \xe2\x80\x93 and may also lead to heart disease, gum disease and oral lesions.""People understand the risks involved and still choose to do it,\'\' Texas Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said. ""We all do stupid things, whatever your vice happens to be. People may criticize these guys for dipping, and then somebody\'s texting and driving.\'\'And while Gwynn\'s passing was lamented throughout the game, it doesn\'t figure to be interpreted by many players \xe2\x80\x93 who are usually in their 20s or early 30s, with the concomitant sense of invincibility \xe2\x80\x93 as a cautionary tale.""It\'s one of those things that\'s scary and obviously you hope you\'re not the one,\'\' said A\'s catcher Stephen Vogt, who said he dips once in a while. ""I don\'t think it\'s good. I definitely don\'t advocate it, but at the same time, it\'s an adult decision.\'\'Baseball has taken steps to sway that decision, or at least make the practice less visible to minimize the impact on young fans.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } The San Diego Padres pay tribute to late legend Tony GwynnThe current collective bargaining agreement, in effect from 2012-16, bans players, managers and coaches from using smokeless tobacco during TV interviews and team appearances. And they have to keep tobacco products out of sight while fans are at the ballpark.In addition, MLB and the players union have stepped up educational efforts, and teams \xe2\x80\x93 which in the past freely distributed cans of dip in the clubhouse \xe2\x80\x93 can no longer do so and are now required to administer oral exams as part of the spring training physicals every year.Longtime TV announcer Joe Garagiola, who quit his smokeless tobacco habit in his 30s, made it his life\'s mission to warn other baseball folks about its dangers, making presentations during spring training alongside former major league outfielder Billy Tuttle, who died of oral cancer at 69 in 1998.""I don\'t think we talk about it enough anymore,"" says Atlanta Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez. ""I remember as a young A-ball manager, Joe Garagiola would always come around in spring training with Bill Tuttle.  It was scary.""And I still see people chewing tobacco. Not only in the big leagues, but you still see kids in junior high and high school.For me, it\'s not enough yet.

""So you see it. But at the same time, it\'s like an addiction thing. You do it for so long, you\'re going to want to keep doing it.\'\'Players say using smokeless tobacco provides a form of relaxation and becomes part of their routine in a daily sport with lots of down time.And with amphetamines now banned from baseball, the jolt of energy from the nicotine in the tobacco \xe2\x80\x93 absorbed during a longer stretch through dip or chew than by smoking \xe2\x80\x93 can help players navigate the season\'s six-month grind.Commissioner Bud Selig has expressed a desire to banish smokeless tobacco from the majors the same way MLB barred it from the minors starting in 1993. But the issue is subject to collective bargaining and the players association has declined, opting to protect personal freedoms and emphasize education.""The MLBPA discourages the use of smokeless tobacco products by its members or by anyone else. These products carry serious health risks, yet remain legally and widely available,\'\' union spokesman Greg Bouris said via e-mail.

Encina | The Baltimore SunST. PETERSBURG, Fla.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Caleb Joseph now can concede that there were several times during those late-night bus rides through the Eastern League when he considered calling it quits on his lifelong dream of making it to the major leagues.Joseph felt stuck in Double-A, a minor league proving ground for some and a glass ceiling for others, watching younger teammates as he grew older.That is what made Joseph\'s promotion to the major leagues May 7 from Triple-A Norfolk so satisfying. When the Orioles needed a catcher after Matt Wieters began experiencing discomfort in his throwing elbow, Joseph received his long-awaited call to the big leagues. var adSkipCounter = 0; ""It was very emotional,"" said Joseph, who turned 28 on Wednesday. ""I don\'t have any problem telling you that I couldn\'t finish my BP round [when he received the news]. I was in tears. It was so emotional because I felt like I knew I could play here. \xe2\x80\xa6 You think about all those moments when I almost gave this up. It\'s so much sweeter knowing that I really did persevere through a lot of stuff personally, mentally, physically and spiritually. I\'m a rookie and I\'m 28, but it\'s better late than never, I guess.""When the Orioles acquired veteran catcher Nick Hundley in a trade with the San Diego Padres on May 24, the club kept Joseph over Opening Day backup Steve Clevenger. And now, with Wieters out for the season following Tommy John elbow ligament reconstruction surgery, Joseph has become the club\'s primary starter behind the plate.It\'s a long way from where Joseph was in the offseason. After winning the Eastern League Player of the Year award last season with Double-A Bowie, he was left off the organization\'s 40-man roster and passed over by every other team in the Rule 5 draft in December.Joseph expected to open the season at Bowie for the fifth straight year. And he considered quitting before his newlywed wife, Brooke, nudged him to keep playing at least until he became a free agent at the end of this season. He started the year at Triple-A Norfolk.""When you play 400-something games at one level, you\'re getting into Crash Davis territory,"" Joseph said, referring to the career minor league catcher played by Kevin Costner in the movie Bull Durham. ""And being a catcher, some of the guys called me Crash. It was funny for a little bit, but after a while, you\'re like this is not how I envisioned my career and getting older and older. I felt like I was playing well, and then nothing happens. And you really have to think, \'Is this really what I want to do, need to do, should be doing, what I\'m being called to do?\'""I\'d be lying if I didn\'t tell you that, just about once a week, I thought about hanging it up a couple years ago. I went from somebody to nobody so many times, back and forth, back and forth.""Joseph was rejuvenated when he received an invitation to major league camp this spring. It was his third major league camp in four seasons, but it was an opportunity to show the club the strides he had made over the past year.Still, some in the organization had doubts whether Joseph could be a major league catcher.In his time at Bowie, Joseph also played first base and left field. He could call a good game, play defense well and frame pitches, but he sometimes struggled to block balls and had trouble getting his time on throws to second base under 2 seconds.\'That changed my game\'What doubters might have underestimated was Joseph\'s resilience and dedication to the game.Growing up in Nashville, Joseph\'s grandfather had season tickets for the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Joseph went to games often and always wanted to stay until the final pitch. The best babysitter was the family television, in front of which Joseph\'s parents could sit him, give him a box of Cheerios and let him stay there for hours to watch Chicago Cubs games on WGN and Atlanta Braves games on TBS.As a teenager, he was a clubhouse attendant for the Sounds. Joseph worked with Nashville when current teammate Adam Jones played against the Sounds as a member of the Seattle Mariners\' Triple-A Tacoma team.In his first full professional season playing for High-A Frederick, Joseph actually spent about 30 nights inside the Keys clubhouse.""My apartment didn\'t have a TV or cable or Internet,"" Joseph said. ""The clubhouse had Internet and cable. I\'d watch baseball all night and clean cleats and organize my locker and go through my stuff. I\'d blink and I\'d be there five hours after the game. I didn\'t want [the day to] end, so I found myself being there until midnight, 1 in the morning and I\'d just crash on the couch.""On the field, Joseph worked to refine his catching skills over the years.Current Orioles assistant hitting coach Einar Diaz played a large role in helping him with blocking when Diaz was a coach in Bowie. And Orioles minor league catching coordinator Don Werner was perhaps his biggest advocate along a path with many doubters.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:The old oyster R-month rulePriest at once defended, excoriatedArundel\'s Hibbs loses scholarship to Florida State after drug arrestA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

There was no reason why Kevin Gausman even should have been in the game \xe2\x80\x93 figuratively as well as literally. Gausman took 35 pitches to get out of the first inning, due mostly to what appeared to be a very tight (or non-existent) strike zone as well as a J.J. Hardy error.

He kept TampaCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sportsguessing and their hitters on their toes for much if not all of his six innings in the ballgame. When hitters were looking fastball, he\xe2\x80\x99d go to his changeup and either catch them looking or have them swing through it. When there appeared to be doubt as to whether he\xe2\x80\x99d throw that fastball, he\xe2\x80\x99d go after the hitter and induce a pop fly in the outfield.Unfortunately for the Orioles, Tampa starter Alex Cobb was almost equally as good. He held Oriole bats at bay for the most part. And the funny thing is that it\xe2\x80\x99s games such as this one that Tampa has normally won in the past. Keep in mind that Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s a team that values one run as much as anything else. Whereas if you have the bases loaded with nobody out and someone grounds into a double-play (yielding a run), Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s the type of team that still sees that as a net game \xe2\x80\x93 because the opponent then has to score at least two to beat them.The Orioles were able to take a 1-0 lead in the top of the fifth when Nick Markakis reached base on an error, and Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-double got him home. From that point onward, it was all Gausman and the Oriole bullpen \xe2\x80\x93 with one exception. Yunel Escobar sent a deep shot to center field in the last of the seventh, that appeared destined to tie the game at one. However Adam Jones made a leaping catch against the wall for the third out of the inning, saving a home run and preserving the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead.You never know when you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need an insurance run, so the Birds had no way of knowing that Tampa wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put nary a run across in the game. So when Nelson Cruz slammed his MLB-leading 22nd homer of the season in the eighth, it was a welcome moment. Backing up just a bit, many fans held their breath when Tommy Hunter came into the game in relief of Gausman in the top of the seventh. However Hunter pitched two innings of shutdown ball, which held the Orioles over until Zach Britton (who provided a 1-2-3 inning) came on for the ninth.With this win, the O\xe2\x80\x99s took two-of-three in Tampa. Many fans will grouse that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t sweep the series; however keep in mind that if you\xe2\x80\x99re taking two-of-three in any series you\xe2\x80\x99re doing okay. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will have a day off today in New York, however Manny Machado will presumably have his suspension appeal heard as well. It would probably be a good bet that Machado will be out of the lineup starting on Friday against the NY Yankees.Having said that, the Orioles do feel that they have a legitimate shot at getting at least one game lopped off of the suspension. The league allegedly suspended him four games for the Sunday game vs. Oakland (when he threw the bat), and one game for the altercation in the Friday night game (with Josh Donaldson). Seeing that Machado was never ejected in that spat, it would stand to reason that they might convince the powers-that-be that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t face discipline for those actions.

""I just felt confident that I was going to do something positive.""Beltran signed a $45 million, three-year contract with New York this winter after an All-Star season with the St. Louis Cardinals. But he has struggled with inconsistency and an elbow injury has limited him to the designated hitter role since early June. Beltran began the game batting just .221.But right after Brian McCann lined an RBI single, Beltran hit a drive off Zach Britton (3-1) far over the left-field wall. It was the first time this year that the Yankees won in their final at-bat at home, and it was their fourth straight victory overall.""It\'s been somewhat of a struggle then he got hurt. But you can just see him starting to square the balls up,"" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ""That was a tremendous at-bat.""The Yankees kept coming up empty with runners in scoring position until the ninth.

Then they fizzled, wasting three chances with the bases loaded and failing to capitalize on a career high-tying six walks from Ubaldo Jimenez.""We just couldn\'t seem to get the big hit when we needed it,"" Girardi said.Center fielder Adam Jones threw a runner out at home plate in the second and hit an RBI single in the sixth, helping the Orioles take a 2-1 lead.Nick Hundley doubled for the Orioles\' first hit off Hiroki Kuroda leading off the sixth and scored on Pearce\'s one-out double.Pearce had an RBI single in the ninth three batters after third baseman Yangervis Solarte made a fielding error to open the inning.The Yankees loaded the bases for the first of three times in the second but Beltran, who doubled leading off, tried scoring on Gardner\'s fly to medium center field. Jones\' throw reached Hundley on one perfect hop, and the catcher had plenty of time to apply the tag for the double play.Jimenez loaded bases in the fifth with three straight two-out walks. He needed one pitch to get out of the jam: Teixeira grounded to first base on the first pitch he saw, keeping it 1-0.The Yankees loaded the bases again with two outs in the sixth \xe2\x80\x94 a single and two walks \xe2\x80\x94 but this time Jimenez wasn\'t given a chance to quash the rally. T.J. McFarland was brought in to face Gardner.Second baseman Ryan Flaherty got the save, though, ranging deep behind second base to field Gardner\'s hard one-hopper and making a swift, backhand flip to shortstop J.J.

The Orioles won 6-1. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson)NEW YORK (AP) -- Nelson Cruz has been hitting homers all season. J.J. Hardy finally got in on the fun Saturday, against a likely opponent.Cruz hit his 23rd home run, Hardy connected for his first of the year and the Baltimore Orioles beat the New York Yankees 6-1 after starter Bud Norris left with tightness in his right groin.Adam Jones and Steve Pearce also went deep off struggling soft-tosser Vidal Nuno, helping the Orioles rebound after blowing a two-run lead in the ninth inning of a 5-3 loss Friday night.''Big win for us,'' Hardy said.Cruz and Pearce each had a two-run shot. Hardy ended a drought of 339 at-bats that dated to last September.''It definitely felt nice,'' he said. ''I felt like I forgot how to do it.''''I think it probably is a little bit of a relief. I started to question myself if I ever was going to hit one again,'' Hardy added.Mark Teixeira hit his 12th home run for the Yankees, who had won four straight and eight of 10, but that was all they managed against Norris and three relievers.During a pregame ceremony on the field, former New York first baseman Tino Martinez was honored with a plaque to be placed in Monument Park.Making his first start against the Yankees, Norris (7-5) allowed three hits in five innings and matched a career high by winning his fourth straight start. He warmed up on the mound for the sixth but was pulled for Ryan Webb, who pitched two scoreless innings.Tommy Hunter got the final five outs.Norris said he felt something ''kind of funny'' while throwing a fastball in the fifth.''It kind of grabbed on me,'' he said. ''I've had groin stuff before, especially my left one but not necessarily my right one. You've got to be real careful with those.''''I could see it getting a little worse and I wanted to be smart, but really, hats off to the offense for scoring and to the bullpen for picking me up,'' Norris added. ''Pretty sore right now.''Orioles manager Buck Showalter said Norris probably will pitch the night game of a split doubleheader Friday against Tampa Bay, but the right-hander said it was too soon to tell.''We've got other options, but I'm hoping we caught it in time,'' Showalter said.Pressed into the rotation because of injuries to CC Sabathia, Ivan Nova and Michael Pineda, Nuno (1-4) is having a hard time with the homer-friendly dimensions at Yankee Stadium. He was rocked in his previous outing in Oakland and is 0-4 since beating the Los Angeles Angels on May 7.''This is what we have. And as I said, it's not like there's just starting pitchers lying around out there,'' New York manager Joe Girardi said, explaining that Nuno will stay in the rotation. ''Right now, this is what it is.''The left-hander yielded five runs - four earned - and six hits in 6 1-3 innings. He allowed three home runs and has served up 13 in 39 1-3 innings this season at home, where he is 0-3 with a 7.09 ERA.''My fastball today, I just left it up too much,'' Nuno said. ''I trusted all my stuff today. No regrets and everything, but they just got to my fastball.''Jones hit a solo shot with two outs in the first and drew a leadoff walk in the fourth before Cruz connected. Cruz began the day one home run behind Toronto slugger Edwin Encarnacion for the major league lead.''He's carried us along a lot of the season,'' Hardy said.Pearce's drive made it 5-1 in the fifth, and Hardy went deep off Jose Ramirez in the eighth for his 159th career homer and first since Sept. 5, 2013, against Jose Quintana of the Chicago White Sox.''We like hitting home runs,'' Jones said.Back in the dugout, Hardy got the silent treatment. He threw sunflower seeds on himself and was doused with water by Cruz.The two-time All-Star shortstop has hit at least 22 home runs five times, including a career-high 30 with Baltimore in 2011.''Normally I just put my head down and run. This time I kind of watched a little bit to make sure that it got up,'' Hardy said. ''As I was rounding third, I looked into the dugout and no one had moved. So I kind of knew that they were going to sit there.''NOTES: Baltimore recalled reliever Brad Brach from Triple-A Norfolk. ... Nuno has allowed 15 homers in 67 1-3 innings overall. ... Pineda (right shoulder muscle) will get another week off after an MRI still showed ''a trace of inflammation,'' Girardi said. ...

"", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Orioles hit four home runs, including J.J ... - Camden Chat', "" J.J. Hardy's nightmare is finally over. In the eighth inning of the game, the home run drought came to an end when he blasted a pitch into the left field seats at Yankee Stadium. The run was meaningless insurance in a 6-1 victory over the Yankees on Saturday afternoon, but it meant everything to Hardy. In true Orioles tradition, his teammates gave him the silent treatment as he came into the dugout. Where teammate Chris Davis pantomimed giving high fives and elbow bumps into mid-air, Hardy showered himself with sunflower seeds to celebrate the occasion. The Hardy home run was the fourth that the Orioles hit on Saturday. All six of their runs came via the home run. It is at once the team's strength and weakness. When the power is there, they will destroy you. When the power is not there - whether through a skillfully-executed game plan on the part of the other team, or simply luck - they will be destroyed. Worry about that tomorrow when they face Masahiro Tanaka. For today, bask in the victory as the Orioles gained a game on the team immediately ahead of them in the standings. Even the Yankees got into the act, with their lone run scoring on a home run by Mark Teixeira in the fourth inning. O's starter Bud Norris pulled his favorite move of pointing at the popup, but it turned out that it was actually a home run. Oops.    That home run notwithstanding, it was a good outing for Norris, who allowed only three hits and two walks in five innings before departing the game due to what the Orioles described as right groin tightness. That seems to be an ongoing problem for the Orioles pitching staff this season. With 82 pitches thrown, Norris wasn't exactly on pace to throw a complete game. He did at least look to be going six innings, sparing the bullpen a bit of work.    Since Norris went at least five innings, he was given the win. That puts his record at 7-5 on the season. He now has a 3.62 ERA. For an Orioles starter, anything under 4 feels pretty good, given all the other things we've seen. The injury to Norris pressed Ryan Webb into service for two innings. Webb gave up a hit and a walk but allowed no runs. It's nice when a free agent reliever signing actually works out.    Webb was followed by Brian Matusz, who came into the eighth inning of a 6-1 game, faced three batters, and only retired one of them, because he's Matusz and that's what happens. Actually, though the box score says two hits, one of them should have been an error as Manny Machado misplayed a routine Derek Jeter grounder. It was scored a hit because Jeter's home scorer seems to like him more than the Fenway Park scorer likes David Ortiz. I'm so sad for Ortiz, really. One night after a vintage Yankee Stadium meltdown, there was good reason to fear Tommy Hunter coming on in relief of Matusz with two men on base. Turns out you didn't need to worry that much. Hunter finished off the last five outs without allowing a run. Keeping a safe lead safe. What a concept. This was a game that the Orioles needed to win to salvage something from this series. After Friday's blown game and the matchup of Tanaka against Chris Tillman for Sunday, they needed to be able to take at least one win this weekend. They took advantage of a soft Yankees starter, Vidal Nuno, to do so. Before today, Nuno had allowed 12 home runs in 61 innings. He allowed three more in 6.1 innings today. The Orioles beat the guy they were supposed to beat.    Adam Jones lit the keg of dynamite in the first inning, with a shot to left field to put the Orioles on the board 1-0. That was his 13th home run of the season. Nelson Cruz followed in the fourth inning with a man on base, muscling a home run the other way to the short porch in right - bringing him back into a tie for the MLB lead in home runs. Cruz and Edwin Encarnacion both have 23. Steve Pearce was the other Oriole to get in on the home run party today, because of course he was. He added a home run in the fifth inning, his sixth of the year, and had two hits and a walk on the day. He is now batting .333/.387/.579. Do yourself a favor and don't look at his BABIP. The Yankees brought in reliever Jose Ramirez for mop-up duty. In giving up the home run to Hardy, he showed why he is the mop-up duty reliever. Ramirez also showed his potential, though, throwing hard and striking out four Orioles in 2.2 innings. Neither team had a hit with runners in scoring position on Saturday. The Orioles went 0-5 in those situations, while the Yankees went 0-9. When you have home run hitters on your team, everyone is in scoring position all of the time, even the man at the plate, really. One other play that's worth mentioning came from Caleb Joseph, who helped to snuff out a potential first inning Yankees rally. Norris walked Brett Gardner to lead off the game. The fast Gardner was 15 for 16 in stolen base attempts heading into today. Joseph doesn't care about all of that. Gardner ran; Joseph made a fantastic throw and cut him down, erasing the leadoff runner.    That was the ninth runner Joseph has thrown out in 19 attempts. The league average caught stealing percentage for a catcher is 27%. Joseph has thrown out 47%. He is making the most of his big league chance. It's fun to see. Sunday is Old Timers Day at Yankee Stadium, which means a later start time of 2 o'clock while they do whatever it is they do as part of those festivities.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

They have to find a way and make it happen, and not just for this Old Timers Day Sunday in New York, but for the other series to come this year and in subsequent years.Throughout this season, good pitching has shut down the Orioles. That is a trend that has to also change. To be the best, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be able to beat the best \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe not every time, but with some frequency for sure.This will be the Japanese rookie\xe2\x80\x99s 15th start of the season. He is currently 11-1 with a 1.99 ERA.

The one loss is to the Cubs, of all people, on May 20th. And even that was a quality start, giving up three earned runs is six innings (or maybe it is not officially, as there was also an additional unearned run). Every one of his starts has been a quality start. Does that make him an ace? In fact, he has never given up more than three earned runs.One of Tanaka\xe2\x80\x99s two non-decisions (and the one that was a loss) was his early season game against the Orioles. He went seven innings and gave up that huge three-run home run to Jonathan Schoop. So, in the words of Dumb and Dumber, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m saying there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance.\xe2\x80\x9dAnd here is another reason to have at least a one-in-a-million hope, especially for a team that hit four home runs on Saturday: Tanaka will reach 100 innings pitched on his next out; he has given up 25 runs, and 13 of those have been on homers \xe2\x80\xa6 though eight of them were solo shots. The guy is good.Tying this together with another recent blog post about Ubaldo Jimenez \xe2\x80\xa6 if you take away the games started by these two pitchers for their respective teams, the Orioles are 35-23 while the Yankees are 27-32. That is an 8.5-game difference for those of you who can\xe2\x80\x99t figure it out because of Common Core math.The Baltimore Orioles will send their erstwhile ace Chris Tillman to the mound. Sometimes he can be an ace, and sometimes he\xe2\x80\x99s an \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 less than an ace. He has only given up four runs in his last 13 innings, but both games were losses. Tillman is 5-4 with a 4.82 ERA and WHIP of 1.49.Let\xe2\x80\x99s call this to be a 4-3 Orioles win that we will look back upon as a turning point moment of the season.

Sixty percent of their original starters have been on the disabled list since early May, yet the Yankees have essentially a league-average rotation ERA in late June.Masahiro Tanaka has been arguably the best starter in the American League. Rookie Chase Whitley has been a revelation. David Phelps and Hiroki Kuroda have been perfectly solid and occasionally terrific.But the fifth spot has been a problem, and the fact Vidal Nuno remains on turn to make his next start shows the Yankees really have run out of alternatives. Nuno allowed three home runs and lost his fourth straight decision in a 6-1 loss to the Orioles at Yankee Stadium on Saturday.BOX SCORE: Orioles 8, Yankees 0Granted, the Yankees offense didn\'t do much to support him \xe2\x80\x94 Mark Teixeira\'s solo homer was their only run \xe2\x80\x94 but Nuno\'s rough day was nothing new.Even so, he\'s going to start again.""This is what we have,"" manager Joe Girardi said. ""It\'s not like there\'s just starting pitchers lying around out there. We\'ve talked about that, and our guys have done a pretty good job. They really have. He\'ll continue to go out there and compete and we\'ll do the best we can.""GOOSE GOSSAGE: Hall of Famer gets Monument Park honorORIOLES TRADE: No players, just a Rolex for jersey numberThe Yankees have lost two of Nuno\'s past eight starts, but his 5.88 ERA is easily the worst in the team\'s patchwork rotation. Of his 15 home runs allowed this season, 13 have come at home.""Sometimes I leave (a fastball) up a little bit and they take advantage of it,"" Nuno said. ""Yeah, it\'s frustrating just knowing that I\'m not getting the job done, but overall how I see my stuff today is improvement of my other starts.""Nuno allowed five runs, four earned, through 6 1/3 innings.""A lot of nights that\'ll give you a chance to win the game,"" Girardi said. ""We just didn\'t score a lot of runs today, and it probably looks worse than it is.""It\'s also not an isolated incident. Nuno\'s lost his past two starts, and in between the Yankees had a four-game losing streak. Alternatives, though, are few and far between.The Class AAA bullpen is depleted by call-ups and underwhelming performances, particularly from prospect Shane Greene who had a breakout season in Class AA last year. Another top prospect, Manny Banuelos, has been underwhelming in Class AA.The best rotation alternative might be Adam Warren, but he\'s become a trusted setup reliever, and despite having worked as a starter all through the minors and occasionally in the major leagues, Warren is not stretched out enough to throw more than three innings at a time. He could be converted back to a starter, but it would take time and cost a valued reliever.So, for now it\'s Nuno, who gave up a solo home run to Adam Jones in the first inning, a two-run home run to Nelson Cruz in the fourth, and a two-run homer to Steve Pearce in the fifth.""Right now this is our rotation and this is what it will be,"" Girardi said. ""We\'ll just continue to plow forward, and hopefully (CC Sabathia and Michael Pineda\'s) rehabs get going and you get some guys off the DL that are coming back.""But right now, this is what it is.""Chad Jennings writes for The Journal News.BASEBALL NAMES HONORED AT YANKEES\' MONUMENT PARK:FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInLegends honored at Yankees\' Monument Park\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Mandatory Credit: Anthony Gruppuso-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles take the series from the New York Yankees with an impressive 8-0 victory.The Orioles are now tied for second place and sit only a game and a half behind the Toronto Blue Jays, who have not been playing as well as in previous weeks.Chris Tillman pitched an excellent game, while the offense came through to put the game away.One thing to note is that Caleb Joseph was behind the plate again for an excellent pitching performance.Fans questioned the decision to send Steven Clevenger down, while retaining Caleb Joseph. I was among the fans who did not understand the decision. Clevenger had the better batting average, and just appeared to be the overall better offensive player.

Now that he has started more than twenty games, the reasons are clear why he is the obvious replacement for Matt Wieters.The numbers are seen with the starters over the past two weeks. Joseph started most of these games, and the starters have put up an ERA of 2.45.Between the games Wieters, Clevenger, Joseph, and Nick Hundley have played, the pitchers have the lowest ERA when Joseph is behind the plate at 2.72.Joseph has directed Orioles pitchers to more than entire point lower ERA than Wieters, now that Caleb has surpassed 200 innings behind the plate this season. Wieters started 22 games before being placed on the disabled list, while Joseph now has 24.With numbers this low, the pitchers are beginning to warm up to Joseph, which I believe contributes as a big reason for the recent success by the pitching staff.With the low ERA, the opponents\xe2\x80\x99 batting average is below .250 also. Joseph has caught nine runners attempting to steal, which is six more than the next closest catcher who has played this season.I had\xc2\xa0noted several\xc2\xa0mentions by other Orioles writers that the reason for some of the poor pitching had been the absence of Wieters.Joseph most certainly will not give the Orioles the same type of offense as Wieters, but I believe he can manage the pitchers for the remainder of the season. \xe2\x80\x9dI believe he can manage the pitchers for the remainder of the season.\xe2\x80\x9d24 games is only a small portion of the season, but I believe Showalter needs to put Joseph in front of Hundley for the starting job.Hundley has not had as many opportunities, but with barely 100 innings behind the plate, pitchers have an ERA of 4.94. One more comparison is that Joseph has more than double the number of innings, and only seven more earned runs allowed by the pitchers.Overall\xc2\xa0in hindsight, I feel Hundley was a mistake to pick up, and Clevenger deserves to be in the majors with his offensive capabilities.I would pay close to attention to Hundley\xe2\x80\x99s starts to see how the pitchers perform. If they do not pitch well, which the stats say they do not, Joseph needs to begin to play five (if not six) out of seven games . ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Preview: White Sox Vs. Orioles \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Two of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s top home run hitters meet for the first time as Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s Baltimore Orioles take on Jose Abreu\xe2\x80\x99s Chicago White Sox. One difference between these right-handed sluggers is how they fare against left-handers, and that will be on display Monday night. Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Sale and Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Wei-Yin Chen will be on the mound to start a three-game series, as the White Sox look to avoid a fifth straight loss overall and eighth in a row on the road. Cruz is second in the majors with 23 homers while Abreu is third with 21. While Cruz is hitting .419 against left-handers for one of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s best marks, Abreu is much worse at .237. Abreu has never faced Baltimore (39-35) or Chen (7-2, 3.78 ERA). Cruz has a positive history versus Sale in going 3 for 8 with a homer. Sale (6-1, 2.20) is limiting hitters to a .171 average and enters after giving up three runs over six innings Wednesday to earn a 7-6 victory over San Francisco. His lone start against Baltimore came on the road Aug. 28, 2012. Sale yielded four runs over four innings in a 6-0 loss. The Orioles may want to bench Jonathan Schoop since he\xe2\x80\x99s a .197 hitter against left-handers. He has never faced Sale but came through in a big way Sunday with a homer off Yankees star Masahiro Tanaka in an 8-0 rout. J.J. Hardy capped a strong trip by going 2 for 4 with a three-run double. Hardy was 9 for 23 over six games, ending an 87-game drought without a homer in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 6-1 victory. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like a lot of balls have been getting through the infield, I have been pretty fortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d Hardy said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am trying to find that power stroke and hitting that homer yesterday was big for me.\xe2\x80\x9d Baltimore starters went 4-0 with a 2.29 ERA on the 4-2 trip and have posted a major league-best 1.87 ERA since June 9. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no rest for the weary because the big separator up here is the pitching you see,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see Sale tomorrow for the White Sox and if you dwell on it too long, there\xe2\x80\x99s another guy who\xe2\x80\x99s going to slap you back into reality.\xe2\x80\x9d The Orioles took four of seven from Chicago (35-41) last year and have won six of the last eight home meetings. Chen benefits from a 6.59 run-support average that is among the best marks in the majors. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost since May 3, going 4-0 with a 3.47 ERA in his last eight outings after giving up three runs over 6 2-3 innings last Monday in a 5-4 loss at Tampa Bay. The Orioles have won all three of Chen\xe2\x80\x99s starts against the White Sox, with the southpaw going 1-0 with a 2.60 ERA. He has held Adam Dunn hitless in six at-bats with three strikeouts. Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s woes continued with Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 6-5 loss at Minnesota. Abreu and Gordon Beckham each had two RBIs. \xe2\x80\x9cAnytime you sit there and pity yourself, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get buried,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Robin Ventura said. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody cares.

Heck, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that a game with a margin of victory like that should justifiably even have a turning point. However Brett Gardner\xe2\x80\x98s lead off double in the first inning might have indicated that it was to be a long day \xe2\x80\x93 and it was. Just not how we might have thought it was going to be.Having said that, Gardner made it to third base and was initially ruled safe. Buck Showalter challenged the call, which in my view at the time was an unnecessary risk. My personal opinion was that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough evidence to overturn the call on the field. But after further review the umpiring crew overturned the call and ruled Gardner out at third base. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say how the game would have unfolded had that call gone the other way. But needless to say it set the tone for the day.Chris Tillman turned in arguably his best performance of the season. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7 IP, 4 H,Courtesy of Anthony Gruppuso-USA TODAY Sports0 R, 4 BB, 2 K. Like in 2013, the key for Tillman was his off speed pitches, which he was able to get across when he needed to do so. Speaking of pitching, the consensus going into the game was that Masahiro Tanaka would dominate Baltimore Orioles bats. But that went out the window in the second inning when Jonathan Schoop hit a Tanaka pitch deep into left field to give the Birds a 1-0 lead.This is not to say that New York never amounted a challenge to Tillman and the Birds. Ellsbury led off the fourth with a double, and with two outs NY had runners at the corners. However Tillman induced a comebacker directly to his glove off the bat of Kelly Johnson, and that particular threat was done.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 1-0 lead in theory would have been safe given that Tillman and reliever TJ McFarland (who pitched innings) held New York off the board. However you never assume anything until the 27th out is recorded. So when Jonathan Schoop manufactured an RBI on a fielders choice and Caleb Joseph produced a sac fly-RBI, the Orioles suddenly found themselves leading 3-0 with a bit of breathing room.With one out in the 8th the O\xe2\x80\x99s had two runners in scoring position and New York opted to intentionally walk Chris Davis. J.J. Hardy came to the plate with hopes of replicating his first homer this season (which came on Saturday) with his second \xe2\x80\x93 which of course would have been a grand slam. Hardy was unable to do that, however he did hit a bases clearing three-RBI triple which gave the Birds a 6-0 lead. Hardy would run the lead to 7-0 when he scored on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single.So most of the drama was gone from the game as one could imagine, however catcher CalebCourtesy of Anthony Gruppuso-USA TODAY SportsJoseph decided to give Orioles fans one more thrill on the afternoon, as he launched his first big league home run into the left field grandstand, sending most of the Yankee Stadium crowd\xc2\xa0that remained\xc2\xa0to the exits.Many fans will complain that the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t sweep this series, and perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s a point well taken given that New York won with two outs in the ninth on Friday. However the fact is that if you\xe2\x80\x99re taking two-of-three in series\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99re doing fine. And let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that this is now two consecutive road series\xe2\x80\x99 in the AL East in which the O\xe2\x80\x99s have taken two-of-three. The win brought the Orioles into second place in the division, and to within a game-and-a-half of first place Toronto.Tonight the Orioles will open up a three-game set with the ChiSox, with Wei-Yin Chen on the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s.

Absalon, USA TODAY Sports)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Hours after reaching the low point of a disappointing and frustrating season, Chris Davis conjured memories of last year with one mighty swing of the bat.Davis interrupted a rare stint on the bench with a pinch-hit, three-run homer in the ninth inning to give the Baltimore Orioles a 6-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Monday night.Davis was excluded from the starting lineup after batting just .130 in his previous 14 starts. Called upon by manager Buck Showalter with runners on first and second and one out in the ninth, Davis launched a 3-2 pitch from Ronald Belisario (3-4) into the seats in right field.BOX SCORE: Orioles 6, White Sox 4""Any time you\'re able to deliver and come through for your team, it\'s big,"" Davis said. ""Like I said earlier today, I\'m working as hard as I can to get back on track.""Davis, who led the majors in home runs and RBIs last year, started the game in the dugout with a .216 batting average and 78 strikeouts in 218 at-bats. When it came time to deliver, though, he was ready.""There\'s no woe is me,"" Showalter said. ""He knows at some point the club\'s going to need a good at-bat from him and he prepared himself for it from about the fifth inning on.""POWER RANKINGS: O\'s on the riseDavis ended his night with a celebration at the plate, followed by a pie to the face from teammate Adam Jones during the post-game TV interview.""It was chocolate,"" Davis said.

Still, the White Sox were poised to win before Davis connected.""You got to be able to close it out,"" manager Robin Ventura said. ""It\'s not easy, especially when they got a guy like Chris on their bench.""White Sox starter Chris Sale gave up a career-high 11 hits in six innings but was in position to earn his seventh win after leaving with a 3-2 lead. The left-hander walked one, hit a batter and had a season-low three strikeouts.""My own manager was calling me Houdini,"" Sale said.Chicago trailed 2-1 until Abreu led off the sixth with a drive over the wall in center. Dayan Viciedo followed with a double and Conor Gillaspie chased starter Wei-Yin Chen with a run-scoring double.An RBI double by Abreu made it 4-2 in the seventh. The rookie ranks third in the AL in home runs and is tied for third with 60 RBIs.Joseph hit his second homer in two games, a solo shot off Zach Putnam in the eighth. The drive capped the rookie\'s first career three-hit game.That set the stage for Davis\' 13th home run. He hit 53 last year.Baltimore went up 2-0 in the first inning when Steve Pearce walked and Jones followed with a drive to center that bounced off the top of the wall, only the fifth home run allowed by Sale this season.Chicago got a run back in the third. Adam Eaton reached on an infield hit, Gordon Beckham doubled and Abreu hit a run-scoring groundout.In the bottom half, Sale struck out Delmon Young and J.J. Hardy after the Orioles put runners on the corners with one out. One inning later, Baltimore loaded the bases with one out before Pearce hit a short fly and Jones struck out.The trend continued in the fifth, when three straight singles filled the bases with no outs. After Manny Machado hit into a force at the plate, Jonathan Schoop bounced into a 4-6-3 double play.NOTES: Jones\' HR was his 151st with Baltimore, tying Chris Hoiles for 10th place on the Orioles\' career list.

Another year of giving the ""real prospects"" some live action practice. His name had been thrown around as a possible back-up in Baltimore but he would be a distant runner-up. As fate may have it, one mention of discomfort in Matt Wieters\' elbow and an underwhelming Steve Clevenger led to the unlikeliest of call-ups, making Joseph a 28-year-old rookie and, at this moment, the starter for the Baltimore Orioles. As you once wrote in someone\'s year book, what a long, strange trip it\'s been. Bio Name: Caleb Martin Joseph \xc2\xa0Number: 36Born: June 18,1986 (28 years old) in Nashville, TNHeight: 6\'3"" Weight: 180 lbsBats: Right  Throws: RightDrafted: 7th round by the Baltimore Orioles in the 2008 amateur draftSchool: Franklin High School (Tennessee)Lipscomb University (Nashville, TN)Contract: ($500,000 in 2014, rookie, free agent: 2020)Became an Oriole: draftedTwitter: @McGrattan17 Personal Caleb didn\'t want to go to Lipscomb University. It was a school right in his home town of Nashville. His father had attended the school in the 80s, playing baseball and basketball for the Bisons. His grandfather, on his mother\'s side, had played baseball there as well.    ""I wanted to try and go somewhere bigger,"" Joseph told MLB.com\'s David Wilson. ""I tried hard not to go there and I really didn\'t have any other offers.""    According to the Lipscomb University athletics website, it does seem that Arkansas, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt each took a look at Joseph. However, none were motivated enough to offer a scholarship. Lipscomb it was and it turned out to be a positive decision. After playing mostly shortstop in high school, Joseph switched to catching in college because it would allow him to play immediately. The shortstop at Lipscomb was Tadd Brewer, a young man who was two years older than Caleb and who would go on to be drafted by the Angels, but never make it to the big leagues.    In his final season at Lipscomb, Joseph led the team to it\'s first Atlantic Sun Conference Tournament and they won the championship, qualifying for the NCAA Tournament. After just three years, Joseph was drafted by the Orioles. It was no surprise as the Orioles showed the most interest, followed by the Diamondbacks. Back in 2008, Joseph\'s college coach said that the O\'s came to see him ""two or three times"" and that their ""cross-checker"" scout even gave him the OK. He was set to head to Baltimore. But that first game in an Oriole uniform was a long way away.    His career down on the farm began normally enough. He torched through short-season Aberdeen and high-A Frederick in two seasons. After 2009 he was named the Orioles tenth best prospect and the best defensive catcher in the organization. Onward he went to Bowie, double-A, the fast track for the majors. There he would spend most of the next four seasons, playing 428 games and breaking the club record for number of games played. Not exactly a number you want your name next to for a minor league squad. His only refuge was a 22-game stint with Norfolk in the middle of the 2012 season. However, he only managed to hit .202 there without a single home run. Back to Bowie it was. Those two years in Bowie, 2012 and 2013, were arguably the best of his minor league career. Especially 2013 where he hit .299 with 22 home runs, 97 RBI, made the Eastern League All-Star game, and won the home run derby at the event. He was even named Eastern League Player of the year. However, he still would not warrant even a September call-up. In fact, the Orioles left him off of the 40-man roster. But they were not alone in their indifference towards Joseph. No other team selected him in December\'s Rule Five draft in which the O\'s chose Michael Almanzar. It seemed that Joseph was set to stay at Bowie another year and was reaching his breaking point. That is where his wife, Brook stepped in.    In January, Joseph married Brooke\xc2\xa0at\xc2\xa0a ceremony in Nashville. The couple had met one another through mutual friends they knew from college. Caleb\'s proposal took place in front of friends and family at the Botanical Gardens in Maryland several months before the wedding. Brooke pushed Caleb to keep playing. He wanted to quit and get away from baseball. He felt his age and the uncertainty of a minor league baseball life was getting to be too much. ""I\'d be lying if I didn\'t tell you that, just about once a week, I thought about hanging it up,"" Joseph told the Baltimore Sun. Lucky for him, he kept pushing. And for that, he is quickly becoming a fan favorite and someone that the Orioles need to keep around, at least when Kevin Gausman pitches. Quick Hits  His catcher\'s ERA is 2.72 (league average is 3.79) Joseph is a baseball addict. He didn\'t have a favorite superhero as a kid because his parents would only let him watch sports. He would spend hours in front of the television watching the Atlanta Braves on TBS and the Chicago Cubs on WGN His favorite player growing up was Fred McGriff Joseph was once a clubhouse attendant for the Triple-A Nashville Sounds (Brewers affiliate). He once ran into Adam Jones at a Sounds game. Jones was playing for the Mariners affiliate, Tacoma. When Joseph was with Frederick, he would sleep in the clubhouse a lot of nights. His apartment didn\'t have a television or internet so he would watch games at the stadium and sleep on the couch.

The White Sox defeated the Orioles 4-2. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles, like many teams in this strange season of parody and surprises, have had the unusual experience of not consistently winning at Camden Yards. Who would have expected this?With the loss to the White Sox last night, the Orioles are now 17-18 at home and 23-18 on the road. Stated as relative to playing .500 baseball, they are home/road -1 / +4.\xc2\xa0 In 2013, it would be +11 / -3.\xc2\xa0 In 2012, it was +13 / +11.\xc2\xa0 And in 2011, the last of the horrible seasons, the Orioles were only three games under .500 at home.Oriole Park at Camden Yards should really favor a power team like the O\xe2\x80\x99s. So this is a weird statistic that defies easy explanation. Yes, the pitching has too frequently not been the best, but honestly, the Orioles have not hit and scored well at home either.The Baltimore Orioles have the second highest team batting average in the American League at .265. But this is about the only category where they are at the top. Even though they have had decent numbers with runners in scoring position, that has to be skewed by having many of those hits come in non-critical situations.When one studies and looks more deeply into the many metrics of offensive production (such as these advanced statistics), the Orioles are very much a middle of the pack team in most categories. For example, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are eighth in the AL in average runs scored per game \xe2\x80\x93 an admittedly important statistic, since that is what determines who wins or loses!Last night\xe2\x80\x99s game (Tuesday 6/24, 4-2 loss to the White Sox) illustrates some of the frustration in one small sample. They were 9-for-32 (.281) with four walks (OPB of .361), but were then 1-for-9 with RISP and hit into four double plays.

He visited 22 MLB parks and 17 minor league stadiums before his stop in Baltimore, and finally found what he considers perfection on Eutaw Street with a 60 out of 60.Lohr was a fan of the traditional Esskay hot dog from his other visits to the area, but part of what pushed the Camden Yards fare to the top was the specialty dogs available at the Stuggy\xe2\x80\x99s stand in center field. He tried a crab mac-and-cheese dog with the ballpark\xe2\x80\x99s executive chef, Josh Distenfeld, and had nothing but praise for it.But where Camden Yards distinguished itself was in its ballpark score.He said other ballparks, such as AT&T; Park in San Francisco, muddle the retro feel with gimmicks like kids areas and special attractions.Those parks try to be too much, he said, while Camden Yards \xe2\x80\x9cis a baseball stadium.

It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t try to be anything else.\xe2\x80\x9dTuesday\xe2\x80\x99s bargain night ticket prices, and the passion of the crowd on hand swung him to the highest marks possible.\xe2\x80\x9cI was kind of on the edge there with the fans that showed up,\xe2\x80\x9d Lohr said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were so enthusiastic that I had to give them that score.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Colorado Rockies\' Coors Field ranked highest as of the visit to Baltimore, with a score of 58. The Pittsburgh Pirates\' PNC Park and the Arizona Diamondbacks\' Chase Field both followed with scores of 57.5.Lohr also visited two other local ballparks on his way up to New York \xe2\x80\x94 Nationals Park in Washington, and Prince George\xe2\x80\x99s Stadium in Bowie, home of the Double-A Bowie Baysox.Nationals Park scored a 55 \xe2\x80\x94 26.5 for the hot dog, and 28.5 for the ballpark. Only the ambiance kept Nationals Park from matching Camden Yards as a ballpark. He likened the experience to \xe2\x80\x9ca baseball game [breaking] out in the warehouse section of Ikea.\xe2\x80\x9dMy friends in Bowie, unfortunately, didn\xe2\x80\x99t fare so well. The hot dog scored a respectable 25, but the ballpark was given a 19 because of the small Friday night crowd.I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a hot dog in Bowie before, but so as to distinguish myself from my media colleagues, I will not discuss the food in Bowie.jmeoli@baltsun.comtwitter.com/jonmeoli     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:The old oyster R-month rulePriest at once defended, excoriatedArundel\'s Hibbs loses scholarship to Florida State after drug arrestA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

The game was took so long to complete, 4 hours and 3 minutes plus a 1 hour, 9 minute rain delay, that by the time David Lough raced in with the inning run, the pathetic offensive display by the Orioles through the first seven innings and the uneven pitching performance by starter Ubaldo Jimenez were just hazy memories. They were washed away by Nelson Cruz's eighth-inning grand slam and Tommy Hunter's 12th-inning strikeout of Paul Konerko on all breaking balls. Going into the eighth inning, the Orioles had seven hits, all singles. It took them until the seventh inning to get a runner past first base, when they were losing four to nothing to Hector Noesi, a pitcher so bad that he's on his third team this season. They started the eighth with two more singles, knocking Noesi out of the game. And when relief pitcher Zach Putnam got Steve Pearce and Adam Jones to fly out, it felt like it would be another wasted chance. But then Chris Davis worked a walk to load the bases, bringing Nelson Cruz to the plate as the tying run. Cruz had grounded into two double plays in the game. It was his chance for redemption, and he took it. With the count 2-1 he went opposite field on a fastball. It was hit well, but looked like it would be a close play. Right fielder Moises Sierra, who had come in for defense at the start of the inning, tracked the ball. It looked like he might catch it. He timed it, leaped for it, and...missed it! That ball\xc2\xa0JUST got out of the park. The crowd was small tonight, just 20,000, but they went wild as the Orioles circled the bases to tie the game. Choruses of CRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUZ filled the air. In that moment, just as with Chris Davis' walk-off home run on Monday, all offensive troubles were momentarily forgotten. But would it be enough? We had to wait to find out, as after a quick ninth inning, the rains came, forcing a one hour, nine minute delay before the start of the 10th inning. It was a shocking turn of events, really. The Orioles had been playing woeful baseball the entire game. Just terrible. Since joining the White Sox rotation at the end of April, Noesi hadn't had a scoreless outing. He hadn't pitched in a game and not walked at least one batter. He had given up eight home runs in 56 innings and had a 4.47 ERA. And the Orioles couldn't do anything against him. And as for Jimenez, he at least teased us with the idea that he might be good tonight, which is more than we usually get from him.    Honestly, for the first six innings of this game Ubaldo Jimenez didn't look terrible. Nobody was going to mistake him for Felix Hernandez out there, but he looked much improved from the Ubaldo of recent past. He was keeping his pitch count down, he wasn't walking everyone in sight, and he racked up six strikeouts through the first four innings. The first run of the game scored in the fourth inning when Jose Abreu hit his 23rd home run of the year to lead off the inning. It was annoying because it felt like at the time like one run was enough to beat the Orioles thanks to the lifeless hitting, but really not upsetting. I mean, he's Jose Abreu. That's what he does.    Jimenez walked Alejandro De Aza to start the sixth inning, his first of the night. As is so often the way, that runner came in to score. Two batters after the walk, Adam Eaton hit a high fly ball to right-center field. It hung up for a very long time, but it looked like Nick Markakis was running in wet cement trying to get to it. Has he always been this slow? De Aza scored easily and Eaton cruised in to third base with a triple. He then tried to score on a ground ball to third base, but even he isn't that fast. Manny Machado threw home to Nick Hundley, who tagged him out easily. After a quick sixth inning, things fell apart for Jimenez in the seventh. He again walked the leadoff batter, Dayan Viciedo, then De Aza double to put two runners in scoring position for Tyler Flowers. Flower hit a ball over Steve Pearce's head in left field and while both runners scored, Pearce threw Flowers out at second trying to stretch his single to a double (he was originally called safe, but review showed that he was easily out). With the bases empty and one out, Jimenez gave up another hit and he was pulled from the game. Brad Brach came in to bail him out got two ground outs to end the inning.    The bullpen kept the White Sox off the board, and in fact did a very good job on the night. Brach, Darren O'Day, Zach Britton, Ryan Webb, Brian Matusz, and Tommy Hunter combined to pitch 4 2/3 scoreless innings to take the game to the bottom of the 12th. And finally, in the bottom of the 12th, they prevailed. Nick Hundley walked to start the inning, and was replaced at first by David Lough. Markakis lined a single to right-center field and Lough was off to the races. He wanted to score that winning run, but the center fielder Eaton cut the ball off before it got to the gap. Lough raced around third and it looked like third base coach Bobby Dickerson threw up a delayed stop sign. Lough couldn't stop himself though, and this was the outcome:  So with first and third and no outs, Steve Pearce stepped to the plate. Pearce is used to playing the part of the hero, but tonight he didn't have to. Webb through a wild pitch that catcher Tyler Flowers couldn't get a glove on, and Lough finally got to score his run.

The Orioles defeated the White Sox 5-4 in twelve innings. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe, but the Baltimore Orioles have played 77 games at this point, and by the time they finish their four-game set with the Rays this weekend, which includes a doubleheader on Friday, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will be right at 81 games.So, at the halfway point, what can we say about the Orioles? The O\xe2\x80\x99s right now are 1.5 behind the Jays, and that will soon be 2 games. But they are right in the thick of the division and also the wild card hunt.Hitting: BLet\xe2\x80\x99s first look at some numbers. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are third in the majors in batting average and third in home runs. Neither of those numbers are shocking, the O\xe2\x80\x99s were expected to be a good hitting team. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are right near average at on-base percentage, which is notable for the team of sluggers.Nelson Cruz has carried the offense so far this year. Manny Machado is struggling after coming back from his injury, and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t performed as expected. Adam Jones surged through June and is playing at his normal level. Nick Markakis is having his best season in a few years. Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 average is much lower than last year, and it has been a bit of a struggle for him as well, although it appears that is changing. Second base has been a bit of a struggle, but Steve Pearce has been a revelation for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Overall, the team needs to do a better job of manufacturing runs, as they are relying on the home runs too much, as usual.Starting Pitching: CEveryone questioned whether the Orioles could pitch their way to the pennant this year. And after the first two months, the answer appeared to be no. But in the last month, the O\xe2\x80\x99s starting pitching has done pretty well. The O\xe2\x80\x99s starters are one of the worst rotations as far as striking batters out, which is partly because their pitchers aren\xe2\x80\x99t strike-out pitchers. Their ERA is 22nd overall, but let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest, in the AL East that is not surprising.Ubaldo Jimenez has been the worst pitcher on the staff, Chris Tillman has been inconsistent, and so has Miguel Gonzalez, although not as drastically as Tillman. Wei-Yin Chen has been quite good, despite not going deep in games. Bud Norris has been fantastic, but is dealing with a groin injury right now. However, he has been excellent for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Kevin Gausman currently is pitching the way the O\xe2\x80\x99s expected him to, and if he can keep it up, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have a great chance.Relief Pitching: BI originally gave the bullpen a B, but then I remembered the early season closing struggles. Since Zach Britton became the closer and Tommy Hunter healthy and back in a 7th inning role, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen has been good. The Orioles have the 6th most innings pitched among relievers, and rank around the middle in every statistic. However, there are a few particular outings that have brought those numbers down a good bit.Now, the long relief continues to be an issue, but that is a problem many teams have. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day has been excellent and Ryan Webb has rebounded from his tough start. The O\xe2\x80\x99s pen isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly where it was in 2012, but it is better than 2013, and has been quite good.Fielding: B-This B-minus is not compared to everyone else; it is compared to the standard the Orioles have set for themselves defensively. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are third in fielding percentage, have the most double plays by quite a margin, and lead the majors in outfield assists.But J.J. Hardy has struggled for the Orioles compared to his normal Gold Glove level, and Manny Machado started slowly as well, although his defense is now back to normal. Nelson Cruz has been pretty good at LF compared to what many expected, and Caleb Joseph has been a revelation in place of Matt Wieters, showing the O\xe2\x80\x99s backups at catcher are not a black hole.Overall, missing Matt Wieters is going to hurt the O\xe2\x80\x99s as they move forward. But if they can get Manny Machado and Chris Davis trending back toward last year\xe2\x80\x99s numbers, it will be a good sign. But, it all hinges on the starting pitching, if they keep up what they have been doing, the team will likely be headed to the playoffs for the second time in three years.

Starting pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez was good \xe2\x80\x93 not great, but good. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.1 IP, 8 H, 4 R, 2 BB, 6 K. There were times when Jimenez found trouble, but yet other times when he was right on the ball. His walks were obviously down, but he allowed a lot of base runners with the eight hits. It may be a tough start to really gauge, but he did in fact give the O\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to win.Jose Abreu put Jimenez and the Birds in a 1-0 hole when he led off the fourth inning with a solo home run. An inning later De Aza\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-triple would give the ChiSox a 2-0 lead, on a ball that just hung, and hung \xe2\x80\x93 and hung a bit more in the air. However De Aza also helped Jimenez out a few moments later when Gordon Beckham shot a ground ball to third baseman Manny Machado. I was a bit taken back when De Aza broke for home on contact, however Machado threw to catcher Nick Hundley who applied the tag to get the Birds a key out at home plate. Flowers would send a two-RBI single to left field in the seventh and the Birds were in a 4-0 hole.This was another case of the Orioles not having patience at the plate. In fairness, many scouting reports on the ChiSox indicated that their pitchers threw strikes \xe2\x80\x93 often catching perhaps too much of the plate. But the scouting reports on the Orioles state that they\xe2\x80\x99re a free-swinging bunch. So Chicago pitchers were throwing pitches out of the strike zone \xe2\x80\x93 and that worked out well for them for the most part. Until of course it didn\xe2\x80\x99t.The Birds didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a base runner at second base or beyond until the last of the eighth inning, when Nick Markakis and Nick Hundley led the inning off with back-to-back singles. Chris Davis drew a two-out walk and the bases were loaded. On a side note, the Orioles for so many years were victims of wild moments in games whereby they might have a decent lead (such as 4-0) late in the game only to have to bear witness to big moments in games by their opponents. So now perhaps the shoe\xe2\x80\x99s on the other foot\xe2\x80\xa6Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sports\xe2\x80\xa6there did appear to be a certain energy in Oriole Park at Camden Yards as Nelson Cruz strode to the plate with the bases loaded. As thunder and lightning struck off in the distance indicating an arriving storm, the Camden Yards faithful seemed to sense that something magic was about to happen. And Nelson Cruz rose to the occasion, sending a grand slam off of the grounds crew shed in right field which tied the game.Short of a walk off home run (which we also saw from the Orioles in this series), you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have a more exciting moment than something like that in a game. As the last out was recorded in the ninth and the game went to extra innings, the umpires called for the tarp as the storm was about to hit. If Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s slam didn\xe2\x80\x99t wash away the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offensive ineffectiveness, it was certainly possible that the rain would.With neither team challenging too much in the first few extra innings, Nick Hundley drew a lead off walk in the last of the twelfth. Buck Showalter immediately inserted David Lough as a pinch runner for his speed, and Lough was able to go first-to-third on Nick Marakkis\xe2\x80\x99 subsequent single. As often happens in extra innings, one team waits for the other to make a mistake. And that mistake came in the form of Chicago reliever Daniel Webb\xe2\x80\x98s wild pitch, which allowed Lough to come in from third to score the winning run.The Orioles emptied their bullpen in this game, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re ever going to have to do that you\xe2\x80\x99d like it to be in a game going into an off day. Again, the stats and the ebb and flow of the game (until the eighth inning that is) indicate that the O\xe2\x80\x99s should have lost last night.

The Orioles defeated the Rays 4-1. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAYThe Baltimore Orioles split a doubleheader on Friday with the Tampa Bay Rays. Even though playing the team with the poorest record in all of baseball, it remains difficult to win both ends of a twin bill.Kevin Gausman was simply not sharp in the opener which the Orioles lost to the Rays by a final of 5-2. He was charged with all the runs scored on seven hits along with four walks. He looked like a guy who has been up and down from the minors and now was out of a routine. It clearly seems to be time for a regular rotation routine to be established for the second half of the season. His adversary \xe2\x80\x93 rookie Alex Colome \xe2\x80\x93 had the baseball day of his life thus far. He held the Orioles to one run on two hits through 5.2 innings. Again, the Birds seem unable to figure out a new pitcher or one who has some plus stuff working on that day.Manny Machado did get his fifth home run of the season in the seventh inning, but it is difficult to win games when a team only tallies a total of three hits.The evening game was a much more pleasant experience for the Orioles and their fans as the Birds pulled out a 4-1 victory. Chris Tillman performed at his most efficient best. He threw fewer pitches in four innings in this game than he tossed in the first inning alone of several other notorious outings this year. His final numbers were eight innings with only four hits and a single walk. Pounding the strike zone on the inside and outside of the plate \xe2\x80\xa6 this is the key to solid pitching. Hopefully all the others took note of this approach, though doing it successfully is probably where the devil is in the details. The O\xe2\x80\x99s had 3 hits in game one; Jones had 4 hits in game two!Each team scored a single run in the second inning, and so the score stood at 1-1 until Nick Hundley got all of a pitch in the bottom of the sixth inning for his first Orioles home run. And Nelson Cruz would double the score in the next inning, driving in Adam Jones who had doubled ahead of him for his fourth base hit of the evening. Yes the whole team had three hits in game one, and Adam Jones had four (out of 10 team hits) in the second game.And yes, Adam Jones was a steal for the Orioles when they traded for him after the 2007 season, giving up Erik Bedard as the major piece of the deal. So Bedard (3-5, 4.25) returns to the familiar confines of Camden Yards for today\xe2\x80\x99s 4:05 game three of the series.Bedard has not actually pitched in Baltimore since June 14, 2012 with the Pirates, where the Orioles lit him up for seven runs over 3.1 innings. Tommy Hunter was the starting pitcher for the Orioles that day \xe2\x80\x93 remember when he used to do that?Bedard\xe2\x80\x99s next most recent game against the Orioles was just 10 days ago in Florida where the O\xe2\x80\x99s beat him by scoring five runs in four innings, including a Chris Davis grand slam.The current Orioles lineup has a .275 average against Bedard, with Adam Jones the highest at 6-for-13. Nick Markakis is 5-for-12 with Davis 4-for-10. Nelson Cruz has the most at-bats with 23 that include seven hits and two homers. We certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t be seeing Delmon Young today \xe2\x80\x93 not after Buck sees that he is 2-for-21 over his career against the personality-deprived Canadian.The Orioles will start Wei-Yin Chen for the 16th time this year, and he enters with a 7-2 record with a 3.84 ERA.

We\'re down a man,"" Machado said. ""Obviously I don\'t want to put my team in that situation, especially five tough games.""Machado tossed his bat in the direction of third base during a plate appearance in which Oakland reliever Fernando Abad threw successive high-and-tight pitches. After the bat went soaring, both benches emptied. Machado and Abad were ejected.Abad was fined but not suspended.""I didn\'t throw the bat at the pitcher. I didn\'t harm anybody. And I\'m going to get five games,"" Machado said. ""I didn\'t charge the mound. I didn\'t get in a fight. ... This is an unfortunate event and I\'m going to have to deal with it.""In the opener of that series against the Athletics on June 6, Machado yelled in the face of Oakland\'s Josh Donaldson after the third baseman tagged him on the chest and caused him to lose his balance. Both benches emptied, but there were no ejections.Machado, 21, said he learned a lesson from the experience.""Don\'t do it again,"" he said. ""You don\'t want to be in this situation. No one wants to be in it. We\'ll just go from here and try to put this behind me and just go on playing baseball.""Orioles manager Buck Showalter hoped the five-game sentence would be lowered after the appeal, but was ready to move on after the punishment remained in place.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Mets\' David Wright won\'t go on DL, but will miss Braves series""It was surprising,"" Showalter said. ""We\'re not going to dwell on it. We understand the rules and why things are in place for different reasons. There are repercussions for actions in baseball as there are in life in general.  Hopefully, there will be some positive that comes out of it where Manny is concerned in the future and for all players, managers and coaches.""Machado missed the first month of the 2014 season recovering from offseason knee surgery and got off to a slow start at the plate. Just before Monday\'s suspension, however, he had 10 hits over an eight-game span to raise his batting average 15 points to .239, and he also hit three home runs in his previous four starts.That made the timing of the suspension even tougher to take.""Definitely. It just (stinks),"" he said. ""I was starting to feel a little better at the plate and here they come with that bomb, five games. It was going to come. It was just about time to come.

Initially, he was providing a big spark off the bench when they needed a pinch-hitter late in the game. Eventually, he would get on base nearly every other time he got the opportunity and he would become an every day player. He has hit .321 in 44 games this season with seven home runs and 21 RBIs. His OBP (.385) is fifth best in the American League. Due to the lack of productivity from Manny Machado, he has hit in the number two spot for almost a month now and he will continue to hit there unless someone proves otherwise.Next2 of 8PrevUse your \xe2\x86\x90 \xe2\x86\x92 (arrows) to browse  var tpsInstance;var tpsOptions = {""slideContainer"":""#tps_slideContainer_4665"",""nav"":["".theiaPostSlider_nav""],""navText"":""%{currentSlide} of %{totalSlides}"",""helperText"":""Use your \\u2190 \\u2192 (arrows) to browse"",""defaultSlide"":1,""transitionEffect"":""simple"",""transitionSpeed"":200,""keyboardShortcuts"":true,""numberOfSlides"":8,""slides"":[{""title"":""Baltimore Orioles: 5 Best Players Half-Way Through The Season - Page 2"",""permalink"":""http:\\/\\/thebaltimorewire.com\\/2014\\/06\\/30\\/baltimore-orioles-5-best-players-half-way-season\\/"",""shortCodeTitle"":null,""content"":""<div id=\\""attachment_4666\\""  class=\\""wp-caption aligncenter\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/steve-pearce-chris-davis-mlb-baltimore-orioles-tampa-bay-rays.jpg\\""><img class=\\""wp-image-4666 size-full\\"" src=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/steve-pearce-chris-davis-mlb-baltimore-orioles-tampa-bay-rays.jpg\\"" alt=\\""\\"" width=\\""850\\"" height=\\""589\\"" srcset=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/steve-pearce-chris-davis-mlb-baltimore-orioles-tampa-bay-rays.jpg 850w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/steve-pearce-chris-davis-mlb-baltimore-orioles-tampa-bay-rays-300x600.jpg 300w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/steve-pearce-chris-davis-mlb-baltimore-orioles-tampa-bay-rays-590x900.jpg 590w\\"" sizes=\\""(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\\"" \\/><\\/a>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\""fs-center-img\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\""wp-caption-text\\"" style=\\""width:850px;\\"">Jun 17, 2014; St. Petersburg, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Steve Pearce (28) is congratulated by first baseman Chris Davis (19) and teammates after he hit a 2-run home run during the seventh inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field.

Although he has only hit 134 home runs, he has also hit 637 RBI&#8217;s through his first eight-and-a-half years. He owns a career OBP of .360 and strikes out very infrequently. This year he has continued his consistent play, hitting .298 with an OBP of .358.<\\/p>\\n<p>The one knock on Markakis is that he hasn&#8217;t lived up to what he was supposed to be. When he came into the league in 2006, he was expected to be a constant 25+ home run hitter. Although he hasn&#8217;t been a middle of the lineup type of guy, he has done wonders for the Baltimore Orioles at the top of the lineup over the years, and I don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;re complaining about his lack of power.<\\/p><!\\u2014pageview_candidate\\u2014>""},{""title"":""Baltimore Orioles: 5 Best Players Half-Way Through The Season - Page 2"",""permalink"":""http:\\/\\/thebaltimorewire.com\\/2014\\/06\\/30\\/baltimore-orioles-5-best-players-half-way-season\\/5\\/"",""shortCodeTitle"":null,""content"":""<h2><strong>3. <strong><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/www.baseball-reference.com\\/players\\/b\\/brittza01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-thebaltimorewire.com\\"" target=\\""_blank\\"">Zach Britton<\\/a><\\/strong>, RP<\\/strong><\\/h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div id=\\""attachment_4738\\""  class=\\""wp-caption aligncenter\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/zach-britton-caleb-joseph-mlb-cleveland-indians-baltimore-orioles.jpg\\""><img class=\\""wp-image-4738 size-full\\"" src=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/zach-britton-caleb-joseph-mlb-cleveland-indians-baltimore-orioles.jpg\\"" alt=\\""\\"" width=\\""850\\"" height=\\""559\\"" srcset=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/zach-britton-caleb-joseph-mlb-cleveland-indians-baltimore-orioles.jpg 850w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/zach-britton-caleb-joseph-mlb-cleveland-indians-baltimore-orioles-300x600.jpg 300w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/zach-britton-caleb-joseph-mlb-cleveland-indians-baltimore-orioles-590x900.jpg 590w\\"" sizes=\\""(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\\"" \\/><\\/a>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\""fs-center-img\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\""wp-caption-text\\"" style=\\""width:850px;\\"">May 25, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles catcher Caleb Joseph (36) congratulates pitcher Zach Britton (53) after a game against the Cleveland Indians at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

He is the closest thing that the Orioles have to a five-tool player. Hes has a lot of power, always hits for a high average, has great speed for a power-hitter, and has one of the best gloves in the league. He has made the all-star game three years, has won three gold gloves, and has been named the most valuable Oriole three times.<\\/p>\\n<p>He has always been the leader and anchor of the team, hitting in the middle of the lineup every year, but last year was the best year of his career so far. He hit a career-high 33 home runs and 108 RBI&#8217;s with a .285 batting average. His career average is .281.<\\/p>\\n<p>However, the one problem that has loomed over Jones for his entire career has been his tendency to swing at pitches that shouldn&#8217;t be swung at. He has struck out over 110 times in each of the last four years and has walked over 30 times just twice in his career.<\\/p>\\n<p>This year he is on pace to have just as good of a season as last year. He has hit 14 home runs and 48 RBI&#8217;s while batting .301. However his OBP is at a very low .324 which is just 23 points higher than his average; not good. This is due to the fact that although he has 101 hits, he also has just nine base on balls. If Jones would ever improve on his discipline; there is a good chance that he would be one of the four or five best players in baseball. However, that is a big &#8220;if,&#8221; and I&#8217;m not sure that Jones will ever fix the bad habit that he has of swinging at balls out of the strike zone.<\\/p><!\\u2014pageview_candidate\\u2014>""},{""title"":""Baltimore Orioles: 5 Best Players Half-Way Through The Season - Page 2"",""permalink"":""http:\\/\\/thebaltimorewire.com\\/2014\\/06\\/30\\/baltimore-orioles-5-best-players-half-way-season\\/7\\/"",""shortCodeTitle"":null,""content"":""<h2><strong>1. <strong><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/www.baseball-reference.com\\/player_search.cgi?results=cruzne02,cruzne01&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-thebaltimorewire.com\\"" target=\\""_blank\\"">Nelson Cruz<\\/a><\\/strong>, DH\\/OF<\\/strong><\\/h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div id=\\""attachment_4740\\""  class=\\""wp-caption aligncenter\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/nelson-cruz-mlb-chicago-white-sox-baltimore-orioles1.jpg\\""><img class=\\""wp-image-4740 size-full\\"" src=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/nelson-cruz-mlb-chicago-white-sox-baltimore-orioles1.jpg\\"" alt=\\""\\"" width=\\""850\\"" height=\\""640\\"" srcset=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/nelson-cruz-mlb-chicago-white-sox-baltimore-orioles1.jpg 850w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/nelson-cruz-mlb-chicago-white-sox-baltimore-orioles1-300x600.jpg 300w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2014\\/06\\/nelson-cruz-mlb-chicago-white-sox-baltimore-orioles1-590x900.jpg 590w\\"" sizes=\\""(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\\"" \\/><\\/a>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\""fs-center-img\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\""wp-caption-text\\"" style=\\""width:850px;\\"">Jun 25, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles designated hitter Nelson Cruz (23) is handed a pie while being interviewed after a game against the Chicago White Sox at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

However, he has played better than a 22 home run hitter through the first half of the 2014 season.

He leads the league in home runs (25) and RBI&#8217;s (66) while posting a .284 batting average and a .351 on base percentage. He started off the year really hot but has understandably cooled down, just a little.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Orioles just wanted the Nelson Cruz from Texas. Instead, they got a Nelson Cruz that is hitting home runs left and right instead of just left. He has taken roles as a designated hitter and an outfielder, but has always hit in the middle of the lineup.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Steve Pearce hit two of Baltimore's four home runs off Joe Saunders and Ubaldo Jimenez ended a run of nine winless starts as the Orioles defeated the Texas Rangers 7-1 Monday night.Pearce put Baltimore ahead to stay with a two-run drive in the first inning and connected with a man on in the fourth. It was his first two-homer game during a career that began in 2007.Adam Jones and J.J. Hardy also homered for the Orioles, who hit a major league-leading 46 long balls in June. The four home runs provided Baltimore with a 6-0 lead in the fourth inning against Saunders , who came in 7-0 lifetime against the Orioles.Jimenez (3-8) allowed one run, none earned, and four hits with seven strikeouts in eight innings. The right-hander walked only one after issuing 30 free passes in his previous seven starts.Signed to a four-year, $50 million contract in February, Jimenez was 0-4 in nine starts since May 8 and 0-6 with a 6.28 ERA in eight starts this season at Camden Yards.Saunders (0-5) gave up seven runs and nine hits in five innings. The left-hander is 0-8 over 12 starts since beating Houston last August.The Rangers' 10th loss in 12 games left them 9-17 in June. Texas has dropped six straight on the road, its longest skid since an 0-6 streak in August 2010.Baltimore pounced on Saunders immediately. Nick Markakis drew a leadoff walk and Pearce followed with a drive to left. After Saunders got the first out, Jones hit a shot into the left-field seats.One inning later, Hardy made it 4-0 with his second home run of the season. The shortstop hit 25 last year.It was 6-0 before Texas got a run in the fifth on a throwing error by Chris Davis, who was playing third base for the first time since 2011. That's because the Orioles were without Manny Machado, who began a five-game suspension for intentionally throwing his bat toward third in a June 8 game against Oakland.Davis, who usually plays first base, drew Pearce off first base with a hurried throw while Leonys Martin scored from third with two outs.Caleb Joseph delivered a sacrifice fly in the bottom half.NOTES: The Rangers sent RHP Cory Burns to Tampa Bay on a waiver claim to make room for INF Adam Rosales, who was recalled from Triple-A Round Rock. ... Nick Martinez, who's winless in his last six starts, starts for Texas on Tuesday night against T.J. McFarland, whose previous 14 appearances this season have been in relief. ... The Orioles reinstated INF Michael Almanzar from the 60-day DL and designated the Rule 5 draft pick for assignment. ... Baltimore selected the contract of RHP Ramon Ramirez from Triple-A Norfolk and optioned reliever Evan Meek to the same club.

The Rays won 12-7. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt is generally understood that the American League East is, year in and year out, the most difficult division in baseball. This has created some major challenges for the Baltimore Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 given the spending habits of the Yankees and Red Sox, and the player development skills of the Rays.But it is difficult in 2014 to find the beast in the east. Who would have believed you if you said just three months ago that the Orioles would finish the first half of the season with a 42-39 record but be only 1.5 games out of first place?The combined records of the AL East teams are 9 games under .500. The AL Central is 1 game under, while the AL West is the best in all of MLB with 19 games above .500.In the National League, there is some consolation in knowing the NL East is even worse at 11 games under .500, the NL Central is 18 games above, while the NL West is the worst in all of baseball with 16 games below .500.Putting this all together, the combined records of American League teams are a total of nine games better than the National League.The Baltimore Orioles are on a pace at this moment to end the season actually a game worse than in 2013. This is not what we thought we were going to see in 2014. The good news is that the AL East has been uncharacteristically bad, along with the hopes that the powerful Orioles lineup will simply perform at a much higher level. It is certainly possible, even as the grievous truth is that a great opportunity to run away from the division early in the season has been squandered.Brief Reflections on Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s GameIt was simply a terrible pitching display for the Baltimore Orioles. There is no doubt that the Tampa Bay Rays lineup is among the poorest-hitting teams in MLB. The O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching staff made them look like the 1927 Yankees in giving up 18 hits, including six doubles and five home runs! Matt Joyce \xe2\x80\x93 who was 5-for-6 with two homers, a double, and four RBIs, has to be terribly sad that he is leaving Baltimore.Over and over the Orioles pitchers allowed balls that were up in the strike zone. Miguel Gonzalez set the pattern by only pitching for 14 outs \xe2\x80\x93 his third consecutive poor start since the DL experience. It is difficult to be angry with Gonzalez, who has given about as much bang for the buck as anyone the Orioles have. But I still believe he is a long reliever by talent.It is also difficult to be too angry with the bullpen staff. They have been stellar in the last week or so in giving up only one run in 30 innings. Something had to break.At play is the old domino effect. And Buck Showalter hit the nail on the head pretty well by saying in his post-game comments, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t keep running the same people out there night after night, and our starters know that and they take it very personal. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to execute well enough to get done what they wanted to get done. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a domino effect on a lot of different things. Plus, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve played basically three day games in a row and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got teams standing around on the field for that long, it affects a lot of people.\xe2\x80\x9dMonday Night \xe2\x80\x93 Game 1 with the Texas RangersThe Orioles will begin a four-game series with the Texas Rangers at the Yard tonight. Ubaldo Jimenez will throw against the old friend of the O\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 Joe Saunders.Saunders enters the game with an 0-4 record on the season and 5.19 ERA. This will be his eighth game since joining the Rangers. On June 3rd of this year in Texas, he gave up just two runs on 10 hits over six innings against the Orioles in a no-decision.A lot of the O\xe2\x80\x99s have good numbers against Saunders. Nelson Cruz is 11-for-35 with a double and two homers, J.J. Hardy is 3-for-11 with a homer, Nick Markakis is 9-for-32, Delmon Young is 4-for-13 with a double and homer, and Adam Jones also has a double and homer on 7-for-22.On the other hand Chris Davis is 4-for-21 with a homer, Steve Pearce is 1-for-5 (so play Young!) and Manny Machado is 2-for-10 \xe2\x80\x93 so maybe this would be a good first day to sit out with suspension time.What more can be said about Ubaldo than what we and everyone else has written? When he controls his walks, his stuff is good enough to keep him in most any game. And the Orioles need a long outing from him to give the bullpen a break. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be at the game also, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to not go crazy with wild pitching and a terribly late night. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

(Editing by Gene Cherry) ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Astros Ground Control leak shows anatomy of Orioles ...', ' The Orioles acquired Bud Norris from the Houston Astros at very nearly the last minute of the trade deadline last year. We didn\'t know it at the time, but the pursuit of Norris was a month-long chase involving a number of teams.\xc2\xa0Monday\'s leak from the Astros rumor database shows just how many irons were in the fire at the time, and just how different the final trade was from some of the initial discussions. The story is this: The Astros central database, part of a system they call Ground Control, was accessed and trade rumors from last year\'s deadline and offseason were placed on a leak website called Anonbin. It has not yet been determined whether this leak was internal, whether it was obtained by some kind of hacking exploit, or simply whether some poor sod had his dog\'s name as his password and someone accessed the database using that guess. Whatever it was, the result is that we get to enjoy this rare look into the anatomy of a baseball trade. The first Orioles-related entry in the leaked data is dated June 26, 2013, when Dan Duquette - referred to simply as ""DD"" - called Astros GM Jeff Luhnow to express ""continued"" interest in Norris. When that interest began is not in the leak. This is over a month before the trade was completed. It\'s no surprise that it took so long, given that Luhnow reportedly first asked for either Bundy or Gaussman (sic). Spelling and grammar mistakes are frequent in the database.    Gausman was a definite no, but according to the leaked information, Duquette said he had to check with his doctors on Bundy. That\'s probably because Bundy\'s Tommy John surgery was scheduled to take place on June 27, and presumably after it was completed without Bundy\'s arm accidentally being amputated, Duquette was no longer willing to entertain trading Bundy. Duquette is indicated as ruling out Bundy as a part of any trade on June 28, 2013.    A counter-offer presented by Duquette at this point was recorded as Mike Wright and Pedro Strop for Norris. Wright was a Double-A player at that time, in the midst of a solid season for the Bowie Baysox. Strop, out of favor and out of options on the Orioles major league club, ended up being sent to the Cubs less than a week later in the Scott Feldman trade. Over the next month, Luhnow had conversations with five other teams in which he proposed getting a top 100 prospect back in a trade. I guess it doesn\'t hurt to ask. Those teams who were reported to be at least somewhat interested in Norris to get in these conversations were the Pirates, Red Sox, Giants, Blue Jays, and Tigers. Juggling six teams for a month to pull off one trade sounds awfully complicated.    The idea of trading either Bundy or Gausman for a pitcher like Norris is laughable, and to fans of those other teams, the idea of names like Xander Bogaerts, Kyle Crick, or Aaron Sanchez having been included in a Norris trade probably is too. Little surprise that Luhnow whiffed in aspiring for that tier of prospect. A month to the day after that conversation about Bundy or Gausman, Duquette shows up in the database again, checking in to see whether there is any interest on the Astros side in having a trade that does not involve Bundy. The Astros said this was ""unlikely"", but that they\'d add to the trade to get Bundy. Nice try, Luhnow. Five days later, up against the deadline, the Bundy-less trade is exactly what happened. A July 25 conversation with Pittsburgh shows the Astros were interested in acquiring one of the competitive balance draft picks, with the #73 pick in this year\'s draft coming up in the midst of some unsuccessful haggling. The Astros end rejected a proposed Luis Heredia - the #53 prospect in baseball before last season, according to Baseball Prospectus - plus the #73 pick trade for Norris on July 28.    The rumors stop on July 29. There are no further tidbits about how the trade came down to being finalized. Were Duquette and Luhnow in frequent contact over the last couple of days, or did some scenario play out where Luhnow and Duquette got back in touch an hour before the trade deadline and frantically hashed out a trade, or the other way around? That will have to be left to the imagination. What\'s apparent is that there was some point where Luhnow realized he wasn\'t going to get anywhere with his aiming high. Teams didn\'t want Norris that much. Some may have moved on, like the Red Sox, who got Jake Peavy as part of a three-team trade where they gave up a young big leaguer but not a monster prospect like they deemed Bogaerts or Jackie Bradley. Norris was scratched from a scheduled start on July 30, 2013 in anticipation of a possible trade. Was he scratched with an Orioles trade in mind in particular, or were there still several teams in play? We can only imagine that as well. Given some of the names that Luhnow was asking for, it\'s a bit of a surprise to see what he actually received in return for Norris. A couple of the names that were linked with other teams were among their second-tier prospects, if not their top tier, and the Orioles didn\'t even really pony up a prospect at that level either. ESPN\'s Keith Law\xc2\xa0assessed the trade as the Astros getting ""a 4A position player who can get on base"" (L.J. Hoes) and ""a lottery ticket lefty with arm strength but a long ways to go"" (Josh Hader). Hoes has a .592 OPS in 32 games for the Astros this year. Hader is not regarded as one of the top 10 Astros prospects, though he\'s still getting results now that he\'s moved up to High-A in the Houston system at the age of 20. That\'s a way down from trying to get one of the top prospects in baseball, as the Astros tried to do throughout the saga.    Of course, the Orioles also offered the #37 overall pick, their pick in the draft\'s competitive balance Round A. Maybe that\'s what really pushed them over the top in getting Norris. They were unique among the suitors in being able and willing to offer a pick so high. The Astros used that pick to select University of Virginia outfielder Derek Fisher. Given how the Orioles offseason played out, they wouldn\'t have selected at #37 anyway; that pick would have been forfeited with the signing of Nelson Cruz if they hadn\'t already traded it. There were a lot of possible Norris trades out there. For any given trade, there are probably a lot of possible trades out there. Did desperation on the part of either the Orioles or the Astros lead to an unequal trade, or was it a fair trade? Good process can always have a bad result, so it\'s hard to say for sure. If Hader turns into the next Chris Sale, and Fisher is some kind of future Hall of Fame player, it\'s not going to look like a great deal for the Orioles in hindsight. If the young players flame out and Norris pitches key playoff games for the Orioles, it\'s not going to look like a great deal for the Astros, either. Norris wasn\'t exactly what the Orioles might have hoped in 2013, but through 14 starts in 2014, he\'s living up to the hope that he\'d be able to lock down a starting rotation spot for a couple of years. Norris has so far negated the platoon problem he experienced against lefty batters. If that proves to be a product of design rather than fortune, he should keep up his end of the bargain. Other teams still experiencing rotation struggles might then wish they\'d given up a little bit more to get Norris instead of the Orioles. Wouldn\'t that be something?    For now, it looks like the Orioles managed to get a useful starting pitcher in Norris while keeping their best pitching prospects. That looks pretty good. The Astros got a late-first round pick and a still-promising lefty, which probably also looks pretty good on their end.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Jeter emerged from the stands bloodied and bigger than life.\xe2\x80\x9cI met him on the dirt of the infield, and I kind of gave him a little slap, like, \xe2\x80\x98Great catch!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Sturtze, who threw the pitch. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he looked at me, like, \xe2\x80\x98What are you, an idiot? I\xe2\x80\x99m sore!\xe2\x80\x99 I was just so fired up about the catch.\xe2\x80\x9dThe play, of course, became a cornerstone of the Jeter legend, and it stands now as the last moment of the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 cosmic stranglehold over the Boston Red Sox.

Heck, last night\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles starter T.J. McFarland himself had been victimized on a occasion or two. However this year in spring training the Orioles did stretch him out a bit, knowing that there could come a day when they might need a spot start out of the bullpen. That day came last night. McFarland\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.0 IP, 7 H, 2 R, 0 BB, 2 K.Normally we\xe2\x80\x99d be here talking about\xc2\xa0another short outing by a starter, but the fact thatCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsMcFarland is generally the long man out of the pen for the Baltimore Orioles, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take a five inning outing. McFarland isn\xe2\x80\x99t a hard thrower, but he pitches-to-contact and records outs when need be.  As you can see by his pitching line above, McFarland only struck out two batters; hence he pitches-to-contact. The Orioles once again took an early lead, using two homers in the first inning to get ahead. Steve Pearce hit his third homer in two days, and Nelson Cruz hit his first in a few days to give the Orioles a 2-0 lead. However a single and two doubles in the second inning tied the game for Texas. But those would be the only runs that McFarland would give up on the night. And for the record, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had the lead back in the last of the inning when Caleb Joseph smacked a two-run home run.Perhaps \xe2\x80\x9cthe key moment\xe2\x80\x9d of the game occurred in the last of the fourth with one out and the bases loaded. The one benefit for the defense with the bases loaded is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a force out at every base. Caleb Joseph hit what should have been a double-play ball to Elvis Andrus at short. Andrus bobbled the ball, and Texas was unable to record even one out \xe2\x80\x93 and J.J. Hardy scored from third. The Orioles would tack on three more runs on Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x98 two-RBI double and Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had an 8-2 lead.For once it seems, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had an opponent make a mistake in a game and they were held accountable for it. The Orioles have often seemed to have someone open the door for them in games only to let them off the hook by grounding into a double-play, or flying out. Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 two-run double and the sac fly by Pearce were also good signs. The O\xe2\x80\x99s have been scoring runs exclusively on homers for a few games, so it was nice to see some manufactured runs last night as well.Texas would put one more across in the sixth on an RBI-groundout, however with the 8-3 win last night you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard pressed to argue that the Birds haven\xe2\x80\x99t dominated in the first two games of this series with Texas. McFarland really did a huge service to Buck Showalter and the Birds last night by bridging the gap in the rotation that was created with Bud Norris\xe2\x80\x98 injury. The Birds did blow through four other relievers (after McFarland) last night, however they each pitched one inning. Showalter threw Zach Britton in for the ninth just because he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t worked since Friday night.The Orioles will look to Chris Tillman tonight to continue the trend of beating Texas. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Miles Mikolas who will be making his first start of the season for Texas. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be greeted by some Oriole bats that will come in pretty hot.

07/03/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Former Orioles finding success', 'Photo: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard to believe, but last season the Orioles began play on July 3rd with a 48-37 record. The 2014 Orioles currently have a 45-39 record. However, the major difference is the Orioles are presently a game back of the Toronto Blue Jays for the division lead, whereas last season they were 3.5 games back. Most of the core players from the 2013 roster are still on the 2014 roster. However, like every off-season for almost every team, the Orioles had several departures between last season and this season. This is especially true for the pitching staff.Around this time last season, the Orioles made a deal sending Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop to the Cubs for veteran starter Scott Feldman. Arrieta and Strop were both exceptionally talented but had fallen out of favor with Orioles management, as well as Orioles fans, after an extended period of inconsistency. They seemed to be classic \xe2\x80\x9cchange-of-scenery\xe2\x80\x9d players and Feldman seemed a good fit for a rotation seeking a stabilizing veteran. The Orioles got what they wanted from Feldman in the second half of last season. He was anything but exceptional, yet gave the Orioles quality innings pitching to a 4.27 ERA in his 15 starts for the Birds. However, the Orioles lost Feldman to free agency when he signed a lofty three year, 30 million dollar deal with the Astros. Feldman started off the season hot but has recently cooled off, and currently holds a 3.92 ERA in his 14 starts this season.Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop have both seemed to find a home in the National League. Arrieta made headlines earlier this week when he took a no-hitter into the eighth inning. He currently has an ERA of 1.81 in his 11 starts this season. He has also only walked 17 batters this season. In comparison, he walked 17 in 23 innings with the Orioles last season. Strop also seems to be more comfortable in Chicago. He has an ERA of 2.93 in 31 appearances this season. However, control still seems to be an issue as he has walked 15 in that span. An important member of the 2012 rotation that drove the Orioles into the post-season, Jason Hammel struggled with constancy and health in 2013, eventually losing his spot in the rotation. In the off-season, Hammel signed a one-year deal with the Cubs. Like Arrieta and Strop, Hammel has also found success in Chicago pitching to a 2.98 ERA over his 16 starts this season. He also averages nearly nine strike-outs per nine innings. The biggest surprise of the former Orioles would be Francisco Rodriguez. In 2013 with the Orioles, K-Rod hardly resembled the closer that once saved 62 games. In fact, he pitched to a very mediocre 4.50 ERA in his 23 appearances with the Orioles. However, this season he owns a 2.34 ERA in 42 appearances with the Brewers, and even leads all of baseball in saves with 27.Baseball is impossible to predict and there is no way of knowing what these players\xe2\x80\x99 numbers would look like if they were still in an Orioles uniform. However, the Orioles made a decision to allow these players to leave and are now hoping that the changes to their pitching staff translate to more success in 2014 than 2013.

The Orioles clawed and scrounged their way to tie the game in the sixth frame, setting up Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s no-doubter bomb in the seventh.On various Orioles sites comment boards I often see Ryan Flaherty referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cFlaredog.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, this dog had its day with the home run, along with several very nice plays at third base.Flaherty is in my view a nice utility player to have around, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t now nor have I ever seen him as an everyday answer at any position. But he is a plus defender at any position and can give you some left-handed at-bats in the low .200s with some occasional power. He is going to have his dog\xe2\x80\x99s day once in a while, and it happened last night.The win kept the Orioles on pace with the Jays at a game behind \xe2\x80\x93 having the same number of losses, though two less wins. The Yankees are now 3.5 games behind the Orioles.This Texas Rangers team is clearly a fraction of what we are used to seeing with this franchise. Their starting pitching is really pretty rough and minimal, tough that changes tonight with Yu Davish taking the hill. Other than the 2012 playoff game, the Orioles have never faced him. He is currently 8-4 with a 2.42 ERA. He shut out the Twins over eight innings in his most recent start, though in his two prior outings he was touched for four runs by both the Angels and A\xe2\x80\x99s.Wei-Yin Chen will counter with his 7-3, 4.19 stats. His last outing against the Rays was not a good one at all, lasting only 3.1 innings. Of late, Chen has begun to leave too many pitches too high, and he has been paying for it.Though Chen has not pitched against the Rangers this year, his three previous starts have all been very good. In each he was the winning pitcher \xe2\x80\x93 giving up one run in each game for an ERA of 1.29.Against Chen, Elvis Andrus is 3-for-8 with a double, while Adrian Beltre has only a single in nine at-bats.The Rangers have lost eight consecutive games on the road and are now 10 games under .500.Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles lineup \xe2\x80\xa6 hoping the rain does not make it a late one \xe2\x80\xa6Nick Markakis RFSteve Pearce LFAdam Jones CFNelson Cruz DHChris Davis 1BJ.J.

The Orioles (45-39) moved six games over .500, equaling a season-high.""That was really impressive,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""That was one of the more impressive things I\'ve seen, to be able to bring that intensity into a game like that. The whole group, I was real proud of them tonight.""The game was delayed 1 hour and 38 minutes because of rain in the bottom of the eighth inning.Jones hit his 16th home run of the season and had three RBIs. Flaherty, who started at third base in place of the suspended Manny Machado, hit his fourth homer of the season and also made several nice defensive plays.Baltimore has homered in 12 consecutive games.Orioles right-hander Brad Brach (2-0) entered in the sixth and earned the victory by throwing 1 1-3 scoreless innings with two strikeouts. Zach Britton earned his 11th save with a perfect ninth.Texas\' Miles Mikolas was effective in his first major league start. He allowed three runs and three hits with four strikeouts and two walks over 5 1-3 innings.Texas (37-47) has used 11 starting pitchers this year, most in the American League. The Rangers have lost 13 of their past 16 games.""It was a lot of fun being out there,"" Mikolas said. ""I thought I pitched a pretty good game up until the fifth. Then, I had some trouble with some walks. Things kind of didn\'t go our way after that.""Staked to a 4-1 lead, Mikolas walked Nick Markakis and Steve Pearce with one out in the sixth. Jason Frasor entered and allowed a sacrifice fly to Jones and an RBI single to Nelson Cruz. He then walked Chris Davis before allowing a game-tying RBI single to J.J. Hardy.Flaherty provided the Orioles with their first lead, 5-4, hammering an offering from Neal Cotts (2-5) onto the flag court behind right field to lead off the seventh. Jones added an insurance run that inning with a two-out single.""It\'s sum of the parts for sure,"" Flaherty said. ""It can\'t be the same guys every night. And it\'s an opportunity for other guys to get in there and try to contribute and help the team win.""After winning his previous two starts, Baltimore right hander Chris Tillman struggled most of the game. He allowed four runs \xe2\x80\x94 three earned \xe2\x80\x94 and seven hits with two strikeouts and four walks over 5 2-3 innings.Texas took a 1-0 lead in the first on a two-out RBI single by Alex Rios. In 18 starts, Tillman has given up 16 runs in the first inning.""It was a grind,"" Tillman said. ""It wasn\'t good. I made some pitches when I had to. I had some stuff. I was consistently behind in the count. You have to make pitches on a consistent basis.""Cruz, who leads the majors with 26 homers, appeared to tie the game with a towering shot in the bottom half of that inning before Leonys Martin made a leaping catch over the fence in center field.""That was awesome,"" Rangers manager Ron Washington said. ""He beat the ball to the fence, timed it perfectly and brought it back. Nelson can just swipe the ball in this ballpark and it will go a long ways.""The Rangers added three runs in the next inning on a two-run double by Adrian Beltre and a run-scoring grounder by Rios that bounced of Tillman\'s lower leg.Jones\' homer in the fourth pulled the Orioles within 4-1.NOTES: Baltimore RHP Bud Norris (right groin strain) threw a bullpen session Wednesday and will throw again Friday. Norris, who is eligible to come off the DL July 7, likely will need a rehab start or simulated game before rejoining the rotation, Showalter said. ... Orioles RHP Suk-min Yoon, who is on the minor league DL, received a cortisone injection in his right shoulder to reduce inflammation and will be reevaluated after being shut down for a few days. ... Davis hit off the tee before the game with Showalter observing. He went 1 for 3, snapping an 0-for-21 skid with a single in the eighth. ... The Orioles will try to sweep the four-game series when LHP Wei Yin Chen (7-3, 4.19 ERA) faces Rangers RHP Yu Darvish (8-4, 2.42) on Thursday.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Orioles wake up against Texas bullpen after early Tillman ...', "" When the Orioles face a pitcher making his major league debut, as they did on Wednesday night against the Miles Mikolas of the Rangers, they seem to do poorly. That's probably because we only remember the failure, but still. They looked like they were going to be getting dominated early, at least until Orioles Magic happened and they eventually went on to a rain-delayed, but not denied, 6-4 victory. For five innings, it was not an impressive performance against Mikolas. He only allowed three hits, one of which was a home run by Adam Jones, putting the Orioles on the board in the fourth inning. They trailed 4-1 because Chris Tillman was not good. Other than that Jones home run, neither was the Orioles offense, at least not until the sixth inning. Sometimes, all you have to do is stand there and let a guy walk you. That's what Nick Markakis and Steve Pearce did with one out in the sixth. Rangers manager Ron Washington had seen enough, pulling Mikolas with only 77 pitches thrown to tap reliever Jason Frasor from his bullpen. The Rangers bullpen has spent this season at the corner of Suck and Failure, so that's something of a bold strategy on Washington's part. Maybe we would have had to do a lot of cocaine to understand. Actually, it's possible the rookie was losing it and that was time to get him out of there, but Frasor, it turned out, was not the right guy to come in tonight.    Frasor uncorked a wild pitch, which moved up both runners into scoring position, then allowed Jones to hit a run-scoring sacrifice fly. Nelson Cruz singled to score Pearce from third, moved up to second on a Chris Davis walk, then scored when J.J. Hardy singled. Just like that, the Orioles had tied the game. Frasor gave up two hits and a walk in only two-thirds of an inning. He was charged with only one run, but he also allowed two inherited runners to score.    The next man out of the Texas bullpen was Neil Cotts, a lefty. It's a good idea to put in a lefty when two of the next three batters are lefties. That's the theory, anyway, but in practice, Cotts went 3-1 to the first batter, Ryan Flaherty, then left a meatball out over the plate. What does Flaherty do with meatballs? He, uh... he eats them. That metaphor sounded better in my head. What I mean to say is Flaherty hit his fourth home run of the season, a pretty shot that flew out onto the flag court, giving the Orioles a 5-4 lead in a game they looked like they had no chance of winning early. Only 16 more to go to live up to Hardy's pre-season prediction for Flaherty. The next time that Flaherty came up to bat, Texas intentionally walked him. What?    Later in the seventh, Jones got his third RBI of the night when he singled to drive in Pearce, who'd reached on his second walk of the night. He scored both times. Imagine that. All of the runs were needed to paper over a shaky outing from Tillman. Many of his struggles have come in the first two innings of his starts. Going into tonight, 30 of the 46 earned runs he had allowed came in the first and second innings. Tonight it was more of the same from Tillman, who got himself into trouble from the game's first batter. Three first inning singles led to a run. Tillman sent the 7-8-9 batters down in order in the second inning, then got himself in trouble again to start the third by walking Shin-Soo Choo. A fluke play put another runner on base. A hit and run play saw Choo put in motion, and Tillman threw a pitch so bad that Elvis Andrus had to take an ugly emergency hack to foul it off and protect his runner.    Orioles catcher Caleb Joseph pounced to prevent a wild pitch and possibly throw out the runner, but Andrus' downward cut caught Joseph's glove. This was ruled catcher's interference, which is the letter, if not the spirit, of the law. Manager Buck Showalter came out in vain for a lengthy protest. In a perfect world, once your Opening Day starter gets two men on base, one by a fluke, he would bear down and limit the damage. We live in the world where that starter was Tillman. Adrian Beltre touched him up for a two-run double and scored two batters later on an infield single from Leonys Martin. He'd put the Orioles in a 4-0 hole, though only three runs were earned. Martin contributed both at the plate and in the field for Texas on Wednesday. On top of his two hits and RBI, he also robbed a sure home run by Nelson Cruz in the second inning. Cruz hit a fly ball to deep center. It hung for a long time, giving Martin time to dash to the fence, climb it, and grab the ball before it could land in the O's bullpen. He made it look easy. On the night, Tillman went 5.2 innings, giving up the earned runs on seven hits and four walks against two strikeouts. Most nights, that's not going to be good enough. He left the game with the bases loaded in the top of the sixth. Brad Brach retired Carlos Pena on a groundout to first to limit the damage, which proved to be crucial. Brach pitched a scoreless seventh, striking out two. Darren O'Day added a perfect eighth. There was a rain delay of an hour and 36 minutes in the bottom of the eighth. Rain delays are the worst. It didn't hurt the O's any tonight, though. Zach Britton pitched a drama-free ninth to end it after the long delay, recording his 11th save of the year in 13 chances.    The Orioles have now won three straight against the faltering Rangers. These are the games you want to win, especially with the Blue Jays winning earlier on Wednesday. The O's keep pace at a game back in the division. Thursday's series finale will have Texas starting Yu Darvish, so, you know. Don't expect a four-game winning streak, which you shouldn't have done regardless of who's starting because these are the Orioles. Wei-Yin Chen starts the 7:05 game for the O's.

Photo: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsTwo points made an impression on me during tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game, both negatively.In the third inning, Texas\xc2\xa0scored three runs to take a 4-1 lead, with two runs coming on a double\xc2\xa0by Adrian Beltre that went by Chris Davis down the right field line. Then Leonys Martin singled in Beltre with the Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 third run of the inning. The next thing I knew, the camera caught Davis having a very pleasant chat with Martin, whom\xc2\xa0he was holding at first base. The two were teammates with the Rangers prior to the trade that brought Davis and Tommy Hunter to the Baltimore Orioles in 2011.Having been teammates should not be a reason a player would catch up with an old friend, if he had just knocked in a run, and his team just scored three runs to take a lead. We can\xe2\x80\x99t know what was said. Maybe Davis told Martin\xc2\xa0a joke about the fact that he had robbed Nelson Cruz of a homer in the first inning.I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting Davis should hate his competitor for any\xc2\xa0reason, although some players do exactly that unabashedly. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s old fashioned to say\xc2\xa0that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the time or the place for a friendly chat.During the competition, he is not your friend, particularly not if he just drove in a run. Believe it or not, hotly Players of the past are not the only people famous for refusing to get buddy-buddy with the opposition competitive professional athletes, such as the Bob Gibsons and Frank Robinsons of the past, are not the only people famous for refusing to\xc2\xa0get buddy-buddy with the opposition. A junior high school Physical Education teacher of mine told that to the class during a wrestling instructional lesson. I agreed with it when Robinson and Gibson were known for it, I agreed with my P.E. teacher (not just because he was the teacher), and I agree with it now.The sentiment stands even though\xc2\xa0Davis\xe2\x80\x99 walk set up J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s game-tying single in the 6th inning. All was well that ended well, as the Orioles went on to survive a 1 hour, 38 minute rain delay and win. Ryan Flaherty had a solid night at third base in addition to leading off the bottom of the seventh inning with\xc2\xa0a home run that put the Orioles ahead to stay.The other item that made an impression on me occurred when the umpires called catcher\xe2\x80\x99s interference on an obvious foul ball by Elvis Andrus, and did not reverse the call despite conferencing for several minutes on whether the bat hit touched Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x98s mitt.A friend of mine pointed out that Orioles announcer Joe Angel had said if 50 percent of all calls are overturned by replay, apparently the umpires\xc2\xa0were not right 99 percent of the time, as most people normally give them credit for.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsBefore series between the Red Sox and Orioles, my colleague Pete Sonski at our FanSided site for the Red Sox \xe2\x80\x93 BoSox Injection \xe2\x80\x93 asks me to write up a little something as a preview. For a different touch than our previous Q&A thing, my creative friend suggested the following prompt for me:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve just received a phone call from Dan Duquette naming you interim manager for the 2nd half of the 2014 season. What are you going to do to lead the O\xe2\x80\x99s to the AL East Division Championship?\xe2\x80\x9d hey\xe2\x80\x93with my last name, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been called \xe2\x80\x9cBuck\xe2\x80\x9d beforeSo here is my answer that I sent to him that he has included on that site today:A first impulse is to just answer simply by saying \xe2\x80\x9cmore of the same.\xe2\x80\x9d It is difficult to be too terribly critical of Buck Showalter. Unlike the revolving door of his predecessors, I think Buck is indeed a great baseball guy who is very sharp and difficult to criticize much. Where the Orioles have not played well enough to gain more victories, it is not because Showalter did not pull the right levers. It is because players you would expect to be performing at a higher level were simply not getting it done (like Chris Davis batting .210 and $50 million-Ubaldo Jimenez with a 3-8 record).So there are only a few somewhat different moves I will be making now that I am in charge.Young Kevin Gausman will become a regular part of the rotation until such time as he proves he is not at all ready and capable \xe2\x80\xa6 but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is going to happen. The Orioles have had him up and down and up and down all season between AAA Norfolk and Baltimore. He has pitched several very fine games, and he is by talent the best arm on the team \xe2\x80\x93 throwing into the upper 90s deep into a game. So it is time to fully unwrap the present, take it out of its box, plug it in and see what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got. We will start this on Sunday in Boston.Starting pitching has been up and down for the Baltimore Orioles. It was presumed to be the Achilles Heel (or should I say the \xe2\x80\x9cAchilles Arm?\xe2\x80\x9d) for the O\xe2\x80\x99s this season, while the hitting was expected to be awesome. Honestly, though far from a group of aces, the pitching has done reasonably well on most occasions, while the offense has been the cause of more losses. Even so, the bats have come alive of late, as the Orioles led all of baseball with 46 home runs in the month of June.All of this is to say that, if I am going to promote Gausman to a regular turn in the rotation, someone has to be pulled out. That someone is going to be Miguel Gonzalez, who has really struggled since coming off the DL a few weeks ago from a groin injury (the ailment of the year for Orioles players). Over the past two years, Gonzalez has performed well and been a sweet deal for the amount of dollars being paid. But he does not have overpowering stuff, and he therefore needs to pitch on the edge all of the time. He has little margin for error; and when he tires in the fifth or sixth inning, he can go over the cliff quickly. I see him as a long reliever, though I will still have to start him one last time in Boston.That will leave my Orioles with a rotation of Chris Tillman, Ubaldo Jimenez, Wei-Yin Chen, Bud Norris (coming back from, what else? \xe2\x80\xa6 yes, a groin injury), and Kevin Gausman.It is going to be pretty much impossible to replace Buck in the clubhouse and in the hearts of the players, but, if they want to call me \xe2\x80\x9cBuck\xe2\x80\x9d it will be fine. With a last name pronounced \xe2\x80\x9cBuck-man,\xe2\x80\x9d it is not as if that has never happened before. However, I may prove to be a little bit less loyal than the former Buck.Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty on some occasions is a bit over the top, as he will stick with a player in a designated role or position in the batting order longer than is maybe deserved. His belief is that historic performance will, given some patience, generally return to a similar level. While this may be true more often than not, until it happens, Chris Davis may be batting lower in the lineup than fourth or fifth. For example, he just broke an 0-for-21 streak and is batting about .150 over the past month. And Manny Machado will have to come back from this five-game suspension and continue to prove that he has earned the #2 position in the batting order once again. His first game will be Saturday, but he was hitting the ball hard before this inconvenience came along.

This is a personal opinion more than an Orioles criticism, because, in fact, we may have one of the best situations in MLB for a \xe2\x80\x9ccloser\xe2\x80\x9d in Zach Britton. Since I was not named to this position until now, and if I had been in a decision-influencing role over the winter of 2012-13, I would have screamed loudly that I wanted Koji Uehara to be secured for the back of bullpen \xe2\x80\xa6 I wrote about it extensively at the time, but he ended up on this other team somewhere else! All to say \xe2\x80\x93 if the meat of the opponent\xe2\x80\x99s order comes to bat in the eighth inning and we are holding on to a one-run lead, Britton will be on the mound throwing his deadly sinkers then, and not being saved for the ninth.So, I thank my friend Pete Sonski for the wonderful opportunity to take the Baltimore Orioles to the AL East championship.Sincerely,\xe2\x80\x9cBuck\xe2\x80\x9d Buchman ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles sign two players to international free-agent deals ...', '/* Javascript deferred */var addthis_options = ""digg, twitter, facebook, stumbleupon, delicious, friendfeed, buzz, slashdot, reddit, mixx, fark, linkedin, aim, google, myspace, newsvine, technorati, tumblr, typepad, wordpress, more"";var addthis_exclude = ""print"";var addthis_pub     = ""archivedigger"";/* Javascript deferred */Orioles sign two players to international free-agent dealsJuly 04, 2014|By Eduardo A.

I\'ll try to update if any different news is announced.

A very late arrival into Boston, a day game following a night game, and an opponent that had not only not traveled the day before, but also had the day off. But that all got washed out with the weather, so now they\'ll just have to contend with Jon Lester.\xc2\xa0In addition to being the Orioles longtime nemesis, Lester is having a fantastic year. He has given up three runs or less in 14 of his 17 starts and has an ERA of just 2.92. His FIP is even better at 2.84. Lester has already faced the Orioles once this season on Opening Day. The O\'s won that game, but Lester was very good. He gave up just two runs in seven innings with eight strikeouts. If you\'ve been paying attention to the Orioles lately, you probably know that Miguel Gonzalez has had his troubles. He hasn\'t actually given up a large number of runs, but he can\'t pitch deeply into the game, he\'s giving up walks, and he just looks over matched. \xc2\xa0I hope he can get it together because I\'m a fan of his, but as things go right now it seems the bullpen is his destiny. Gonzalez has actually had success against the Red Sox in his short career, pitching to a 3.13 ERA over five games (three starts). He hasn\'t faced the Red Sox yet this season. As you might expect, not many Orioles have had individual success against Lester. Although it\'s impressive to me that Adam Jones has drawn eight walks! That\'s a 12.5% walk rate, which for Adam is unheard of. Also, it might be a good time to give Chris Davis the day off.

It\'s tough to have faith that he will, certainly. Jimenez vs the Red Sox seems like a terrible match up. Jimenez has walked 54 in just 96 innings pitched, and the Red Sox are third in walks in the American League (first in the A.L. East). He has already faced them twice this season and the Orioles have two losses to show for it. Jimenez ""only"" walked three in each game (for a guy who sometimes walks five or six, three doesn\'t seem so bad). Jimenez has made six career starts against the Red Sox with a 9.31 ERA and a .403 OBP against. Ouch.      And how about John Lackey? He\'s pitching well this season, but his last two starts were disasters. Against the Mariners and Yankees, Lackey went a combined 8 2/3 innings with 12 runs allowed. More of that, please! One of his worst starts this season did come against the Orioles, when he gave up six runs in 5 1/3 inning on April 18th. But he also shut them down in the first series of the season. Since this is Lackey\'s 12th year in the majors, some Orioles have racked up a decent number of plate appearances against him. Nick Markakis and Chris Davis have had success against him. J.J. Hardy...not so much.

They won\'t have any starters on regular rest, as the last time this place in the rotation came up it was taken by T.J. McFarland. The Orioles put Gausman through another one of those ridiculous one-inning outings in the minors on Wedensday, which means he should be well rested enough to make this start. McFarland was good enough in his start against the Rangers, and as of now he hasn\'t pitched again, but I can\'t imagine they\'ll give him another start. I say this mostly because it\'s high time the Orioles just stuck Gausman in the rotation and let him be. That and they\'ll probably need their bullpen to be full strength with the doubleheader.   Gausman has made five starts for the Orioles this year, three of which were outstanding. Those, of course, came when he was pitching regularly and on four days rest. If he starts on Sunday, he\'ll be on another screwy schedule. I still want to see him. Jake Peavy has been up and down for the Red Sox this season. He\'s been up more than down overall, pitching at least six innings in 14 of his 17 starts, and giving up three runs or less in 10. But he has more than his share of clunkers, two of which came against the Orioles earlier this year. He gave up five runs with five walks in 4 2/3 innings in April, then just about a month ago he lasted seven innings against the O\'s but gave up four runs, all of which were on home runs. And two of those homers were to Nick Markakis and Ryan Flaherty, so you know Peavy felt a little stupid. Peavy has given up a lot of homers this year, 1.5 per nine innings, and only three of his starts didn\'t feature a home run allowed. Peavy has been pitching since 2002, but with most of those years in the N.L. West, not many Orioles have seen him many times.       Name PA AB H 2B HR RBI BB SO BA OBP SLG OPS   J.J.

Mandatory Credit: David Manning-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have had a number of recent transactions about which we may catch up with some thoughts and comments \xe2\x80\xa6 doing so while game two of the Saturday doubleheader has begun. The first game was a 3-2 loss to the Red Sox with a walk-off blooper after an infield single and sacrifice \xe2\x80\xa6 geez! Of course, if the Orioles could score more than two unearned runs in nine innings, the situation would not have been present. Good pitching stops good hitting again\xe2\x80\xa6 more on all of this later.A big roster move of course is the return of Manny Machado in game two after his five-game suspension has now been served. The big concern was how the Orioles were going to manage being without him and playing with a 24-man roster. They were 4-1. So much for that big worry. But he is now back, and it will be interesting to see if he can continue with the hot hitting displayed in the series of games just prior to the suspension. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope so, as it would make a huge difference in the lineup. The need for the Orioles is not just to have Manny back from the suspension, but to also have him back to Manny 2013 form.More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterA pending resolution to the Nolan Reimold saga should be realized by the 10th at the latest. He has been designated for assignment after apparent attempts to find a trade partner failed. Any team who claims Reimold off waivers will be responsible for roughly one-half of his $1.025-million salary.Conventional wisdom has always been that Reimold would never pass through waivers \xe2\x80\x93 that he is good enough that someone will claim the former second-rounder and top 100 prospect. But perhaps the salary and injury history will be just enough to squeeze him through successfully? I do hope so. Readers of this blog will not remember my long history of being a Reimold advocate, even in the face of his sad health history. He would appear now to finally and truly be beyond the issues \xe2\x80\xa6 and yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that before, I know. If he goes, I guarantee a day will come when the O\xe2\x80\x99s see him down the road and he spanks our boys and we regret seeing him elsewhere. However, having written all of that, and given the surprisingly awesome situation with Nelson Cruz, Steve Pearce, and Delmon Young this year, there really is no better or different path that Dan Duquette should have taken. Reimold is a good guy, and I hope he can yet be an Oriole player at some point.Also being DFA-ed was Michael Almanzar \xe2\x80\x93 the Rule 5 draftee who has gone back to Boston after his long injury rehab. It never made even the least bit of sense to me why the Baltimore Orioles would have an interest in this guy, even with the yet-to-be-fully-recovered Manny Machado at that time. My guess is that we will not likely hear of this fellow again, though, with all young guys with a dream, I wish him well.As I write this, the Ubaldo Jimenez walk machine is working its poison tonight, but at least the bullpen was not used up in game one.Being recalled to the Orioles also for game two is Preston Guilmet. In his previous stint this year with the Birds he pitched in nine games. He was not scored upon in six innings covering his first four appearances. But then he gave up six runs in the next 3.1 innings of work. His numbers at Norfolk this year feature 27 innings with a 4-1 record and 4.60 ERA; but a good note is that his WHIP is an excellent 1.09.After the end of this second game, the current 26-man roster will need to see a reduction of one player. The most obvious choice would be Ramon Ramirez, so I would look for him to be used a bit before the night is over. Beyond this, another move will need to be made to get Kevin Gausman on the roster for Sunday. So Guilmet may well be gone on the shuttle back to Norfolk, whereas Ramirez would be a DFA.It seems to Baltimore Orioles fans that the Birds are continuously making these moves at a level beyond other teams. I believe this is true to some extent, though less this year than in the last two seasons.As a final unrelated note, the Fox announcers were just talking about what a tiny team is the Red Sox, meaning they have so many small players. It is so true. I remember in the last series pulling up their roster online while looking at the game to check out this very issue.

Many of my fellow writers might disagree with me a bit there given the fact that the press box is high atop the park, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re a fan paying admission to the game it\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad place to go.

Perhaps he is the best guy in the world who builds playgrounds for children in underprivileged neighborhoods and buys kitty litter for the local SPCA.But it is also a well-publicized fact that he divorced his wife during a time when she was going through a battle with breast cancer. From what I do for a career, I know that there is always more than meets the eye in any marriage breakdown. But still \xe2\x80\xa6 somehow Lackey saw himself as the victim in that scenario.

By any measure, he has been granted some grace, so surely there is room for such toward a person like Cruz who has been very open and humble about his transgressions.Lackey had a lot of image repair to be done in Boston over the past several years. After a disastrous 2011 season with a 6.41 ERA and the large contract, surgery took him out of all of 2012.

After designating the oft-injured Reimold for assignment last week because they had no room for him on the roster when he returned from his minor league rehab, they had ten days to trade, waive, or release him. Since they didn't work out a trade, they tried to sneak him through waivers so they could outright him to Triple-A Norfolk. The Blue Jays scuttled that plan by claiming Reimold, so he will be off to the Toronto organization. This is the second time the Blue Jays have tried to get their hands on an Orioles cast-off this season. Previously, they were looking for the services of Steve Pearce while he was in DFA limbo. Luckily for the Orioles, Pearce wanted to remain in Baltimore. Reimold, on the other hand, has no choice. Whoever claimed him, that's where he would be going. If this proves to close the book on Reimold's tenure with the Orioles, he finishes having played 286 games over parts of five seasons, only playing anything close to a full season in his rookie year of 2009. Over that time, he's batted .252/.327/.439, respectable but not great. He's never managed to be both good and healthy for long and, though it seems impossible, he is 30. He is long past the prospect improvement days.    I'll miss Reimold, who I've always irrationally liked ever since his rookie year. He was this unexpected bright spot on a terrible team, especially when he hit a walk-off extra-innings home run against those same Blue Jays. It's a better era for the Orioles now, where they don't have to wait around and hope for disappointing players. I'll miss Reimold, but it's better this way. Ordinarily, this is where I'd wish the former Oriole the best, but since he is going to the Orioles current closest competition for the division lead, well, I hope he shows the Jays why the Orioles DFA'd him.

Mandatory Credit: Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles left fielder David Lough was put into the game on Sunday against the Red Sox at Fenway as a defensive replacement. The Orioles had just scored four runs in the top of the seventh inning to take a 6-1 lead and it made sense to replace starter Delmon Young with the best fielder on the bench.The old adage is that you can never score enough runs at Fenway Park, and that proved to be true again as Boston plated five runners in the bottom of the seventh to tie the score at 6-6.The Baltimore bullpen, which has so often been so good of late, had a meltdown in the seventh inning. It was so bad that even David Ortiz got a hit off Brian Matusz! Yes, weird.Between the two teams in the seventh inning, a total of 18 batters would come to the plate, and 13 hits would be registered.But just as quickly as the bullpen broke down, it locked down from that point forward. Tommy Hunter had a scoreless eighth, while Brad Brach gave the Birds three scoreless innings to eventually get the win. And Zach Britton recorded the save in the 12th to join in keeping the Red Sox off the board.But the difference-making hit came from the defensive replacement David Lough who led off the top of the 12th with a long triple to center field. He would score on a single through the drawn-in infield off the bat of J.J. Hardy.But Lough\xe2\x80\x99s excellent inning was not yet over. After Britton struck out Dustin Pedroia to begin the bottom of the 12th, Big Papi drilled a ball off the Green Monster in left. Lough played the bounce off the wall perfectly and fired to second base to nail Ortiz going for a double. You live by the wall; you die by the wall. It was a big out of a big man \xe2\x80\x93 about the only big guy on the diminutive footie-sox team \xe2\x80\x93 and the truth is that the Sox are indeed bigger than an average little league squad, no matter how much it does not look that way.Zach Britton finished the game with a deserving strikeout of the annoying Mike Napoli, who is now officially the only player who looks back at umpires more than Derek Jeter. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t swing at that, therefore it is a ball; what is wrong with you?\xe2\x80\x9dIt was a good thing indeed that Britton did not allow the game to continue further. \xc2\xa0Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day was not really available and was the only person remaining in the bullpen.

The Rays have also won seven of their last 10, including a series win against the Orioles.The Orioles are beginning to play more and more consistent baseball.

Despite troubles, the pitching has found a way to keep the Orioles in games.The Orioles have their best chance to win the division earlier in the season for the first time in years. The rest of the division is playing poorly with the exception of the Rays, who could move up the rankings if Toronto and New York begin to lose more.The Blue Jays are dealing with injuries, and this is the perfect time for the Orioles to start to pull away. The Yankees are going to stay close, as they have the money to deal with any issues they have before the trade deadline.The Orioles have a 24-17 record against the AL East, while no other member has a record better than two games over .500.If the Orioles continue their dominance over their own division, they will begin to extend their lead upwards.There is only one series left in July that is against an AL East opponent, and that is the Yankees \xe2\x80\x93 to be played after the series with the Nationals.In August, the Orioles have series against the Blue Jays, Yankees, and Rays. Those series are going to be important to win to maintain a lead in the division before heading into September.

Each threw seven good innings, and each gave up a two-run homer \xe2\x80\x93 Strasburg to Nelson Cruz in the fourth inning, and Tillman to Anthony Rendon in the sixth.The Nats had a chance to win the game in the bottom of the ninth inning as Ryan Zimmerman hit a one-out double, but Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day pitched his way out of it with strikeouts of Ian Desmond and Wilson Ramos \xe2\x80\x93 sending the game to extra innings.

McFarland to hold down Washington in the 10th, the Orioles exploded in the top of the 11th. It all started with a broken-bat single by Cruz. And then the struggling Chris Davis came to bat \xe2\x80\xa6 yes, the first baseman who sat the bench yesterday, was 0-for-4 today, and whose average had fallen below .200 during the game. He caught one in the sweet spot, driving it deep into the stands to the right of center field, giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 4-2 lead.J.J. Hardy followed immediately with his third homer of the year. \xc2\xa05-2.Nick Hundley singled, McFarland sacrificed him to second base, and then Nick Markakis drove Hundley home with a double. 6-2.And finally, Manny Machado topped off the first 5-for-5 of his career with a home run to left field. 8-2, the final score, as McFarland finished the game and gained the win.This is the Orioles team that fans expected to see most days \xe2\x80\x93 a decent start, solid defense, explosive power hitting, and shutdown relief.The most gratifying moment for me was to see the Davis home run, and not just because it is good to see him bust out of a slump and make the critical offensive contribution. My brother \xe2\x80\x93 a Nats fan \xe2\x80\x93 was at the game and put the picture to the right on his Facebook page. I commented early in the game that Chris Davis would be hitting a ball to him at that spot at some point in the game.

Though Norris has been mostly solid the whole year, it is always scary to see a first start coming back from an injury.Norris is 2-0 in three starts against the Nationals, giving up eight runs on 21 hits over 19.2 innings. Half of the Nats have never faced him including Bryce Harper; and Jason Werth is only 2-for-14.

The other hit was a two-run homer by Nelson Cruz, his 28th of the season.""He\'s having a great year,"" Strasburg said. ""I need to do a better job of being smart with the location and not necessarily get into the whole challenge, challenge, challenge.""Cruz got the better of that confrontation, but Strasburg had no complaints after turning in a solid encore to his previous outing, when he allowed one run in 7 2-3 innings against Colorado.""I just wanted to go out there and try to build out the last start, just focus on the execution of the pitches,"" the right-hander said. ""We played great defense, but it was tough how it ended.""The Orioles came in ranked second in the majors with 107 home runs, and they padded that total with three in the 11th.After Cruz led off with a broken-bat single off Craig Stammen (0-4), Davis worked the count full before launching a drive into the center-field seats to end a 2-for-38 funk that had dropped his batting average to .198.""I really did not think he would be able to hit that pitch out,"" said Stammen, who had allowed one home run all season. ""He was right on it and he was looking for it. It was a little bit higher than I wanted it.""It was Davis\' 14th home run of the season, the first since a game-winning, pinch-hit shot against the Chicago White Sox on June 23.

Machado doubled with one out in the top of the first, and Strasburg singled on a 3-2 pitch in the third.In the fourth, Machado led off with a single and Cruz drove a 1-0 pitch over the wall in right-center. Cruz has already topped his home run total of last year, when he hit 27 during a season cut short by a 50-game suspension as part of the Biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal.Strasburg struck out the next four batters before Tillman grounded out to end the fifth.The Nationals didn\'t get a runner past first base until the sixth, when Denard Span hit a leadoff single and Rendon followed with his 13th home run, the first since June 24.

You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to look farther than some of the team\xe2\x80\x99s Eastern League All-Star selections -- outfielder Dariel Alvarez, first baseman Christian Walker, and left-hander Tim Berry -- to get a good idea in which players other teams might be interested.As I\xe2\x80\x99ve written multiple times this year, Walker and Alvarez are two of the best hitters in the system. Both got off to scorching hot starts, with Walker sitting at .206/.366/.536 with 20 home runs and 76 RBIs, and Alvarez at .310/.333/.497 with 14 home runs, 20 doubles, and 67 RBIs for the Baysox. var adSkipCounter = 0; Alvarez has developed some buzz in the scouting community for his quick bat and ability to generate power, with one American League scout calling him one of the biggest sleepers in baseball. Walker has the ability to barrel up a baseball, and he has found the power stroke required of a first baseman.My personal preference list would place Alvarez over Walker, though either could be a secondary piece in a larger deal. I doubt either would fetch a ton on his own. But the fact that they are among the top three or four hitting prospects in the system, yet are no more than the second piece in a big deal, is a bigger indictment of the system itself than the players.There are several young, interesting pitchers, headlined by left-handers Berry and Eduardo Rodriguez. Berry is a projectable 23-year-old with a low-90s fastball, a curveball and a changeup who was added to the 40-man roster last fall. He\xe2\x80\x99s 4-5 with a 4.04 ERA, and he still has intriguing upside if a team is willing to wait on him to fully develop.Rodriguez can locate a low-90s fastball and 83-84 mph breaking ball, and he has a feel for a changeup, but none of the pitches grade out as above average. Last year, he was considered in the same category with Dylan Bundy and Kevin Gausman as a player unlikely to be traded, and he still probably is considering he\xe2\x80\x99s in his age 21 season in Double-A.But while Bundy and Gausman would likely be the centerpiece in a big, major league deal, Rodriguez probably finds himself right on the fringe of A- and B-level prospect entering this deadline.jmeoli@baltsun.comtwitter.com/jonmeoli     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:The old oyster R-month rulePriest at once defended, excoriatedArundel\'s Hibbs loses scholarship to Florida State after drug arrestA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe same storm or storms that postponed the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals game to Monday, August 4th came through my home area previously, knocking out power and internet connections \xe2\x80\xa6 I think so. I say \xe2\x80\x9cthink so\xe2\x80\x9d because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know any details at all. I\xe2\x80\x99m cut off from the world with no power or connections. I can see that the internet provider is not operating. I simply heard a one-sentence announcement on the car radio that the game has been postponed.So, this is a challenge to write an article on battery power and candlelight. Late at night here on Tuesday evening, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the teams are planning to do about pitching assignments for Wednesday \xe2\x80\x93 if they will continue with the original plan just pushed back a day or what?I thought it might be interesting to look back to this week just two years ago and see what I was writing about the Orioles at the beginning of July. And it is really encouraging to review and see how far the Baltimore Orioles have indeed progressed from that time.More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterI wrote an article in the first week of July 2012 about what the Orioles needed to address for the second half of the season to be a success. And it certainly was! For the first half of the season the Birds were 44-37, but they then put up a record of 49-32 for the second half.The text that I include here in italics is excerpted from that article of just two years ago this week\xe2\x80\xa6To repeat an already worn-out theme: this is better than practically anyone would have expected in, say, March. Though everyone would acknowledge some good things have happened for the Orioles this year, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think most Birds fans have a confident sense of expectation for the rest of the year. Much of that is the \xe2\x80\x9c14-year history,\xe2\x80\x9d though more of it has to do with inconsistency of performance, the common RISP problems, and glaring defensive errors.If you recall from the spring of 2012, there were few people expecting the Orioles to contend. Most would have been thrilled with a simple .500 season. The O\xe2\x80\x99s had a great start in April, but then did not do as well in the second quarter of the year; and you can see from what I wrote that there was a lot of worry and lack of confidence that even the good first half of the year could be repeated. Inconsistent play and problems with RISP sometimes still continue to be an issue, but we may forget what incredible strides have been made defensively in the past two years. Not only was it successfully addressed for the second half of 2012, it became the foundation for setting all-time records in 2013. Who would have seen that happening just two years ago today?Right now, the Orioles have only about one-half of a regular line-up of high performers in the field and at the plate. Think about it!\xc2\xa0 That statement may have even been generous. There is Adam Jones in center and Matt Wieters at catcher. Sometimes J.J. Hardy, Chris Davis, and Wilson Betemit rise to high performance standards, and Nick Markakis is on the road back. But that\xe2\x80\x99s it \xe2\x80\xa6 everyone else is a fill-in at this point. The Orioles need to particularly have the latter four names pick it up and carry this team.At this point, the Orioles are only \xe2\x80\x9cfilling in\xe2\x80\x9d at catcher and second base. The catcher situation has been at least adequate and only exists because of the season-ending injury to Wieters. And Jonathan Schoop is growing and learning on the job; and it would not be a big surprise to see him suddenly turn the corner into a high level of performance.In 2012 I especially \xe2\x80\x9cwent off\xe2\x80\x9d on the issue of third base \xe2\x80\xa6This is a huge problem. There really is not a visible solution. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to evaluate any trade possibilities for such, as it seems too far into the speculative to comment upon. But the internal options are all rather poor defensively. This is becoming a top priority for the offseason.Of course this was still a few weeks before Manny Machado was moved to third in the minors for a few games, and then brought to the Orioles where the whole defense made a dramatic shift.I was also fretting about left field in 2012 \xe2\x80\xa6With Nolan Reimold out of the equation, insert Avery. He has the tools, will be a best choice on defense, and can maybe grow over the next 81 games to become a regular player in the major leagues. Now the Orioles have Nelson Cruz, Delmon Young, Steve Pearce and David Lough as options. That is quite a difference.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue Call to the PenZach Britton injury update: More forearm pain; sent for MRI FanSided10 things we've learned so far this MLB season FanSidedWhat made baseball fun this week: Aaron Judge digs the long ball FanSidedManny Machado mashes ball over Green Monster (Video) FanSidedAnd not only that, first base was even a concern at this point just two years ago \xe2\x80\xa6There are a number of choices (hopefully which do not include Nick Johnson). Actually, Mark Reynolds is the best defensively (I\xe2\x80\x99ll pause for a moment while the words \xe2\x80\x9cMark Reynolds\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbest defensively\xe2\x80\x9d sink in as having been used in the same sentence without a negative).\xc2\xa0 Chris Davis should be put here and worked with and worked with to make it a positive situation. He has looked so horrible at digging any throws out of the dirt, etc\xe2\x80\xa6 but the guy has the ability and his bat needs to stay in the lineup most days. He could be a star player if he can learn consistency at the plate. He\xe2\x80\x99ll probably always be a streaky hitter, but few people can spank a ball as he does. He has to play until he proves like Mark Reynolds has (imho) that, nice guy aside, he needs to take a train somewhere else.Yes, I was one of those who did not grieve the loss of Mark Reynolds, though he did play better after this article was written, especially defensively at first base. But look at how far Crush was from being considered an every-day player at that time.The leadoff position was unclear in the middle of 2012 with Brian Roberts injured yet again, and I am pleased to see how wise I actually was on this subject, even if I was pretty wrong on a couple of others \xe2\x80\xa6OK\xe2\x80\xa6 call me crazy on this one. Hey, I know the name coming up is not the quintessential leadoff guy \xe2\x80\xa6 I argued for this actually all the way back to early spring training \xe2\x80\xa6 OK \xe2\x80\xa6 here it comes: Nick Markakis. I know he is not the base stealing threat that is desired, but he works pitchers and gets on base at a decent percentage. And remember, this person only really leads off once a game most times.Markakis has proven to be a serviceable, if not approaching terrific, leadoff hitter for the Orioles this year. Few others hit at his pace. I would like to chart that for you, but that will have to wait for electricity to get to me.Complaining about the pitching rotation is a perennial Baltimore songAnd I was complaining about the pitching rotation as well, which is a perennial Baltimore song, but with good reason. But look at this paragraph and see if it does not make you feel better about where we are at here in 2014 at this point, compared to just two years ago.The Starting Rotation \xe2\x80\x93 How many in March would have predicted Jason Hammel and Wei-Yin Chen to be our 1-2 guys at the halfway point?\xc2\xa0 Brian Matusz and Tommy Hunter had to go down \xe2\x80\x93 where maybe someone there can help them the way someone somewhere helped Chris Tillman. So, let\xe2\x80\x99s go with Tillman for a while and hope for good things to repeat \xe2\x80\x93 but 97 mph in the 9th inning in not a fluke!!\xc2\xa0 Jake Arrieta is maddening. His ball has so much movement; how can he not dominate? And hopefully Zach Britton can be brought on to put together a solid second half. It is not crazy to imagine these five names being a winning combination.Of course, Tillman did really come through in a big way, as did an unknown fellow at the time \xe2\x80\x93 Miguel Gonzalez. Also, the bullpen was the strength of the team, which I commented upon positively in that piece.All in all, the Baltimore Orioles in July 2014 are in a much better place than were the Birds of 2012 in terms of personnel. Even so, it will be difficult to replicate a 49-32 second half, but they are off to a good start so far at 7-1. And unlike 2012, the rest of the AL East is not in the condition they were at that time. It is all very encouraging, even if it is still frustrating at times when men are left on base and starters don\xe2\x80\x99t get deep into a game. "", 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

Photo: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsHeading\xc2\xa0down the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut Tuesday\xc2\xa0on the way back from a weekend trip to New York, I hungered for some baseball talk. If I\xc2\xa0could just stumble upon some New York pundit\xc2\xa0talking about the Baltimore Orioles from a New York perspective \xe2\x80\xa6 I knew I could pick up The Fan in New York, and after a while, I found it: 660 on the AM dial.Mike Francesa\xe2\x80\x99s afternoon talk show on The Fan came through loud and clear. Although it is debatable\xc2\xa0he speaks for most of New York, he does have that job because he knows whereof he speaks most of the time.Francesa began discussing the AL East. He\xc2\xa0didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak of\xc2\xa0any team as\xc2\xa0the team to beat. He said Toronto was an unconvincing first-place team, and he knew the Jays were\xc2\xa0bound to\xc2\xa0sink sooner or later, even after their several week hot stretch and lengthy stay in first place.He did not cite Edwin Encarnacion\xe2\x80\x98s trip\xc2\xa0to the Disabled List as a reason for that. My own view is that if I were the Jays, I would even think about resting him for the remainder of July after he comes off the DL, because they\xe2\x80\x99ll need him healthy for the nine games they have remaining with the Orioles. They host Baltimore for three games during the second week of August.The Orioles, Francesa\xc2\xa0said, were \xe2\x80\x9ccatchable.\xe2\x80\x9d Reason? Starting pitching.

The term \xe2\x80\x9ccatchable\xe2\x80\x9d may have been the hopeful thinking of a New York fan, but most Baltimoreans know\xc2\xa0the pitching criticism to be true. He said Tampa Bay will be back in the hunt before it\xe2\x80\x99s said and done, or at least out of the cellar, and that the Red Sox will be the eventual last-place finisher. Sure enough, the standings going into Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s action have the Rays out of, and the Sox in, the cellar.He\xc2\xa0mentioned nothing of the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 impending, three-game series at Camden Yards this weekend. Masahiro Tanaka was placed on the 15-day DL Wednesday and will, of course, miss the Orioles series. Francesa couldn\xe2\x80\x99t know that yet, but it seemed to confirm any pessimism he already had about the Yankees.Ill effects of his suspension? What ill effects of his suspension?The Orioles spent the weekend climbing into first place on the strength of a 5-for-5 Saturday night by\xc2\xa0Nelson Cruz (with what was then his 27th homer) in a win at Fenway Park, and a 5-for-6 night by\xc2\xa0Manny Machado in an 11-inning win over the Nationals on Monday.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Ian Desmond had a night to forget in the finale of a memorable series.Desmond committed a key throwing error and got plunked in the right thumb with a fastball as the Washington Nationals lost to the Baltimore Orioles 4-3 on Thursday night.Steve Pearce homered and Adam Jones and Nelson Cruz drove in a run each for the Orioles, who built a 4-0 lead in the third inning and held on. Baltimore took two of three from the Nationals in this rain-shortened, home-and-home interleague showdown between division leaders.Baltimore\'s final run came when Desmond fielded an infield single by Cruz and threw wildly to third base from his shortstop position in an effort to get Jones drifting off the base. The throw soared over the head of Anthony Rendon, allowing Jones to score.That ended Washington\'s 13-game errorless streak, which matched the team\'s longest run since the franchise moved from Montreal in 2005.""I felt like I had a play at third,"" Desmond said. ""It was just one of those instinct plays. I think you\'ve seen me make that play before. That throw just got away from me. You take chances and sometimes you have to pay for the consequences.""In the eighth, Desmond was struck by a pitch from Darren O\'Day and left the game in the bottom half.""It doesn\'t feel good, but it\'s not broken,"" Desmond said.The Orioles won the opener in Washington, needing 11 innings to do so, before rain postponed Tuesday\'s game until Aug. 4. The Nationals used three homers to prevail on Wednesday before coming up short in the down-to-the-last-out finale.Although the teams are based only 40 miles apart, enthusiasm for the series isn\'t exactly Mets-Yankees or Cubs-White Sox. But there\'s still hope.""It was a good series. It was very well put together,"" losing pitcher Gio Gonzalez said. ""It showed that there\'s a lot of hope for a Beltway Series. They looked good and we looked good. Everyone had some fun.""Jayson Werth homered for Washington and Ryan Zimmerman had two hits and an RBI.Orioles starter Wei-Yin Chen (9-3) gave up three runs and eight hits in 5 2-3 innings, walking none and striking out six. The Taiwanese left-hander is 6-1 in 12 starts since May 3, and his nine wins are most on the team.After O\'Day worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth, Zach Britton got three outs for his 15th save, capping his 22nd consecutive scoreless appearance at home by retiring Werth with a runner on first.""That\'s a very good team,"" Jones said. ""We love the competition, and we love the fact that you never know what could happen in October. You could have a Battle of the Beltway when it\'s a little colder and bring the fans back out.""Gonzalez (6-5) allowed three earned runs and six hits in 6 2-3 innings. His streak of 22 consecutive scoreless innings ended when Pearce connected in the first.Gonzalez won his previous three starts without giving up a run and was unbeaten in four starts following a one-month stay on the disabled list with a shoulder injury.""I felt fine,"" he said. ""It\'s a tough lineup, all the way down to the last guy.""Pearce put the Orioles in front for good with a drive to left on a 2-0 pitch. It was his 11th home run, more than his previous three seasons combined.Following Baltimore\'s three-run third, Zimmerman hit a two-out RBI single in the fourth. Washington got runners on the corners with two outs in the fifth before Chen struck out Rendon on three pitches.The Nationals closed to 4-3 in the sixth. After Werth homered on an 0-2 pitch \xe2\x80\x94 his second long ball in two nights \xe2\x80\x94 Zimmerman doubled and Desmond chased Chen with an RBI double off the scoreboard in right field before Tommy Hunter retired Wilson Ramos on a groundout.Ramos later flied out with the bases full in the eighth.NOTES: Baltimore optioned RHP Bud Norris to Double-A Bowie and recalled RHP Preston Guilmet from Triple-A Norfolk. Norris pitched Wednesday and won\'t be needed against until after the All-Star break. ... The Orioles host the New York Yankees in a three-game series before heading into the All-Star break. Miguel Gonzalez (4-5) faces New York\'s Hiroki Kuroda in the opener Friday night. ... Washington closes the first half with a three-game series in Philadelphia. Jordan Zimmermann will start for the Nationals on Friday night. ...

The Yankees will not and cannot say that, but it is the truth. Masahiro Tanaka was the only player keeping this season from sinking, and now he has a partial tear in his ulnar collateral ligament.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are success stories,\xe2\x80\x9d General Manager Brian Cashman insisted in his conference call with reporters on Thursday, but success, in this case, would still probably mean failure for the Yankees. Even if the platelet-rich plasma injections work on Tanaka\xe2\x80\x99s right elbow, and he returns this season, that means at least six weeks without their ace in the heat of a pennant race.Yes, the American League East is relatively weak, and the Yankees could always make more trades. But they have now lost four starting pitchers, and their lineup is too old and brittle to muscle past opponents. The Baltimore Orioles, who have impact players in their prime, were the best team in the division at the start of the season, and they still are.The really important question is whether Tanaka can pitch in 2016. If the Yankees try this plan and still miss the playoffs, and Tanaka breaks down again next season ... well, it is easy to figure out. Recovery from Tommy John surgery takes at least a year. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Every player is different, Cashman said the doctors told him, and they are right, of course. But ask the Los Angeles Dodgers how this plan worked with Chad Billingsley.In September 2012, the Dodgers announced that Billingsley \xe2\x80\x94 then a 27-year-old former All-Star with six seasons of at least 10 wins \xe2\x80\x94 had a partial U.C.L. tear. Instead of having surgery, he underwent plasma injections and was back on the mound the next April. He started twice, needed Tommy John surgery anyway and has not pitched since. Last month he tore the flexor tendon in his pitching arm.That is the nightmare scenario. The Yankees are far from a hard-luck franchise, but they are now becoming used to such harrowing visions.

It has happened with the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 three highest-paid players \xe2\x80\x94 Alex Rodriguez, C. C. Sabathia and Mark Teixeira \xe2\x80\x94 and now Tanaka\xe2\x80\x99s immediate future is in danger.There were warning signs about Tanaka, the way there were for the Mets when they traded for Johan Santana in 2007 and signed him for $137.5 million. Both pitchers were durable and dominant for their former teams, the very definition of an ace. They started their New York careers exhibiting those same traits.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But Santana\xe2\x80\x99s durability quickly caught up to him, and shoulder trouble ruined his career.Tanaka, at least, has a more correctable issue. The Yankees knew about Tanaka\xe2\x80\x99s huge workload in Japan, but they still invested $175 million in him. Theirs was the highest offer, Cashman has said, but to be fair, other teams also made lavish bids for Tanaka, a polished star who is only 25.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees could not have known how much they would really need him. Sabathia, Ivan Nova (Tommy John surgery) and Michael Pineda were all gone by May 10, and the offense has gotten little from the newcomers Carlos Beltran and Brian McCann. The Yankees are 13-5 when Tanaka pitches and 33-40 when he does not.That record equates to a winning percentage in the neighborhood of the White Sox, the Twins and \xe2\x80\x94 how about this? \xe2\x80\x94 the Mets, who have played this season without their ace, Matt Harvey, who had Tommy John surgery last October.

Adams fell a homer short of a cycle. Anthony Vasquez was solid over six innings. He allowed eight baserunners and struck out six. Frederick Keys 5, Salem Red Sox 4 The Keys pulled out a close one, but the story was Dylan Bundy\'s rough outing. Bundy was pulled with no outs in the fourth after allowing five hits, two walks and three earned runs up to that point. He did strike out two batters in the second, though.    The top of the Keys lineup paced the attack with each of Glynn Davis, Mike Yastrzemski and Trey Mancini putting up two hit performances. Yastrzemski also picked up his 15th outfield assist of the season.    Delmarva Shorebirds 4, Lakewood Blueclaws 5 Nick Cunningham hasn\'t yet adjusted to life in the Sally League. His second start since being promoted from Aberdeen was a bust as he gave up five runs in five innings. He actually held his own until he ran out of gas in the sixth inning, when three of the runs scored. Nothing much to speak of on offense. 3B Drew Dosch went 3-for-4 with a walk and C Austin Wynns singled and doubled.    Aberdeen Ironbirds 4, Batavia Muckdogs 0 How does a team score four runs on just four singles and three walks? Rookie ball, man. It\'s ridiculous. In two innings the Ironbirds scored runs thanks to a combination of errors by the other team, walks, and a few hits. And in each of those innings the Ironbirds made the last out on the basepaths. Fundamentals, boys! Their last run was manufactured by CF Jay Gonzalez, who singled and stole two bases, then came in on a sacrifice fly. Bennett Perry pitched five scoreless innings with only one hit allowed, but walked four. Dariel Delgado had a very good night, finishing the game with three innings of nine up, nine down baseball.

They only scored two runs against a Yankees starter Hiroki Kuroda, who hit two batters and had three wild pitches, and they never walked. Their own starter, Miguel Gonzalez, gave up two home runs. Losses come in all shapes and sizes. So do wins. The Orioles overcame these insignificant details to take the game on a walkoff Nick Hundley single in the tenth inning, beating the Yankees 3-2 on Friday night. They all count just the same in the standings, even the wins where the team gets no hits from the third inning until the tenth inning and only five hits in total. The team only had five chances with runners in scoring position in the entire game, and most of those were the result of wild pitches. Sometimes the hows and the whys are unimportant, just that they did it, and on Friday night, they stole a game they might not have deserved. As we all know, deserve got nothin' to do with it. The heroics looked like they might end up being anything but. Manny Machado led off the tenth inning with a double to right field, but he was stuck there after #8 hitter Ryan Flaherty failed to get down a bunt. Flaherty's bunt attempt was a near disaster: He popped the pitch straight back, but substitute catcher Francisco Cervelli couldn't get there in time. Flaherty struck out instead, bringing up Nick Hundley. Why, with the winning run on second base, did Buck Showalter not pinch-hit for his light-hitting catcher in favor of someone like Delmon Young? This question does not matter either. Hundley drove a single into center field, easily scoring Machado and giving them a win that you have to feel like they stole. Or maybe good teams make their own luck. It was Hundley's second hit of the night, extending his hitting streak to eight games.    Kuroda pitched seven innings for the Yankees, surviving one wild inning where he hit two batters and gave up two wild pitches. The O's scored the two runs they got against Kuroda in the fourth inning, when they only got a lone hit, an Adam Jones single past Derek Jeter that advanced Steve Pearce, whose jersey was lightly grazed, to third base. Pearce scored and Jones took second on the first of the wild pitches, then Jones took third on another wild pitch. He scored the Orioles second run on a Chris Davis sacrifice fly.    Davis looked like he wanted to strike out, but he made contact and flew out deep enough to left that left fielder Brett Gardner didn't even bother to throw home. Those two runs tied the score at 2-2, with the Yankees having gotten runs on a pair of solo home runs, one in the second inning by former Oriole Brian Roberts and one in the third from ninth/designated hitter Kelly Johnson.    Roberts jumped on the first pitch he saw, a total meatball, to hit his fifth home run of the season in the stadium that was his home park for 13 years. The crowd barely had time to notice he was at bat before he homered. He was neither booed nor cheered. He was just there. The Yankees fans among the crowd of 45,389 - a significant percentage - cheered the home run. A shaky fourth inning for Gonzalez saw him give up a single to slow-footed Brian McCann, who couldn't score two batters later when Ichiro Suzuki doubled to right field. That cost the Yankees, who followed up with two weak fly balls that couldn't score McCann either. They only got one more baserunner against Gonzalez, an eighth inning hit-by-pitch of Johnson that may have been intentional. In the end, Gonzalez pitched eight innings, the second consecutive start where he has done so. The home runs were unfortunate, but half that outing was cruise control, too. His final line was eight innings with six hits, two earned runs, no walks, and five strikeouts.    The Yankees didn't threaten again until Gonzalez was out of the game. McCann led off the ninth inning with a single off of Zach Britton. Roberts attempted to bunt him into scoring position, but Davis made a great play and pounced on the ball to throw out the runner at second, despite Yankees manager Joe Girardi using a pinch runner. Then again, it was pinch running one catcher for another. A two-out walk to Yangervis Solarte moved Roberts into scoring position, but Britton got an easy grounder to third from pinch hitter and former Oriole farmhand Zelous Wheeler to end the threat. The game turned into a question of whose relievers would suck first. The Yankees deployed strikeout machine Dellin Betances for the eighth and the ninth inning, giving them the early upper hand in that quest. Betances came into the game having 65 of his last 128 outs being strikeouts, with a 13.67 K/9 for the season. That's actually ridiculous. The Orioles did not get any chances against Betances, either, with the lone baserunner across two innings being a Pearce HBP which may have possibly been a retaliation for the possible retaliation HBP of Johnson. Baseball players are weird. Betances struck out three of the seven batters he faced. He's struck out over 40% of the batters he has faced, which is also ridiculous. T.J. McFarland came on in the tenth for the Orioles, facing the top of the Yankees lineup: Gardner, Jeter, and Jacoby Ellsbury. The O's were undoubtedly the first team to deploy a reliever who makes you nervous. McFarland had an easy inning, though, getting three straight groundouts to keep the game tied.    Since they scored in the bottom of the tenth, McFarland gets the win to go to a 3-2 record on the year. The Yankees' Adam Warren took the loss after his tenth inning effort, falling to 1-5 on the season, though his ERA is a respectable 2.79 - almost half a run lower than McFarland's. By winning the game without hitting a home run, the Orioles have now had three of their last six wins come without home runs. That followed a streak of 33 straight wins where they recorded a home run, and they've now homered in 43 of their 51 wins. They've homered in 22 losses too, just for fun. Friday's win guarantees that the Orioles will have sole possession of first place in the division at the All-Star Break. They remain three games ahead of the Blue Jays, who beat the Rays on Friday night. The O's and Yankees will be back in action on Saturday afternoon, with Chris Tillman moving up to start the Saturday game against Shane Greene following the ankle injury to Ubaldo Jimenez. The game is scheduled to get underway at 4:05.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The Orioles defeated the Yankees 3-2 in ten innings. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsBetween the Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees on Friday night, there was only one hit the entire game by either side with a runner in scoring position. But fortunately for the Orioles, it was Nick Hundley who came through with that one-out hit after Manny Machado had doubled to lead off the bottom of the 10th inning. Baltimore won the game, 3-2.The O\xe2\x80\x99s only managed a total of five hits over the entire 10 innings \xe2\x80\x93 two singles by both Hundley and Adam Jones, and the set-up double by Machado. At the same time, the Yankees were only managing seven hits, including a pair of solo home runs off Miguel Gonzalez who went eight strong innings.More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterThe first run of the game was a second-inning solo blast by Brian Roberts. He saw a first pitch in his power zone and quickly re-acquainted himself with Camden Yards and the local crowd. Many had wondered what sort of reaction he would receive upon his first trip back to his home of 13 prior seasons. The welcome was rather quiet \xe2\x80\x93 just a smattering of cheers and boos. But there was nothing quiet about Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 quick swing.As excellent as Gonzalez was, Yanks starter Hiroki Kuroda was as good or better. The Orioles only managed three hits in seven innings. After his departure, the O\xe2\x80\x99s witnessed one of the most effective pitchers in baseball right now \xe2\x80\x93 Dellin Betances. His two innings added to his seasonal total of 55.1 over 40 appearances, with a 4-0 record and ERA of 1.46.Finally, the Orioles were able to get to Adam Warren with the two hits in the 10th inning. The RBI by Nick Hundley came on a 2-2 count, and the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 catcher did not miss it. He squared it perfectly between the shortstop and second base and the Orioles walked off with the series opening victory.The win drops the Yankees to an even .500 record and five game behind the Baltimore Orioles. The second-place Jays did beat the Rays to remain three games behind. They did it 8-5 with three runs in the top of the ninth to make a loser of Grant Balfour. I know this is going to shock you, but Nolan Reimold had to leave the game with a calf strain while running the bases.At least Nolan Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s latest injury was suffered while playing baseballYou may shake your head in amazement at yet another Reimold injury (he is day to day). But at least he did it playing baseball. Ubaldo Jimenez has been put on the DL by the Orioles for an ankle sprain suffered in a parking lot. Along with Troy Patton, he demonstrates the great danger zone that is to be found when walking across a parking lot or in a parking deck.Chris Tillman will now take the mound for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game two of the series, while Kevin Gausman will start on Sunday. Did I just hear you say that this sounds like a better arrangement than the original plan?Tillman now has a 7-4 record with a 4.11 ERA in 19 starts over 111.2 innings. The Orioles have won his last four games, and Tillman has a 1.95 ERA over those starts with opponents only hitting .198 since June 22. The first game in this stretch was an 8-0 win over the Yankees in his only start against them this year. Tillman went seven innings and only gave up four hits.That sounds a lot better than Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s career numbers of 5-4 against NY in 11 starts, with a 5.83 ERA. But then again, this current Yankees lineup does not look much like what we have seen over recent years from the guys in pinstripes.The Orioles will be facing Shane Greene in the 4:05 game. This will be his third career big league game and his second start. He was successful in beating the Indians this past Monday, giving up two runs on four hits in six innings. He was 5-2 at AAA this year with a 4.61 ERA and WHIP of 1.58. So the Orioles should beat him all over Camden Yards, right? One would think so. On paper, the boy (he is actually only seven months younger than Tillman) has no chance against the powerful O\xe2\x80\x99s lineup, except that the Birds have a reputation of being unable to hit a guy they\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen before. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles 0, Yankees 3: Shane Greene proves to be too much ...', "" The Orioles played nine innings of uninspiring baseball today as they were shut out by a rookie who wasn't even very good in the minors. Chris Tillman and two relief pitchers put together a decent game that on many days would have helped the Orioles win, but on this day the offense wasn't interested in doing its part. The O's hitters were just completely useless against starting pitcher Shane Greene, a fellow making just his second big-league start and who possessed a 4.61 ERA at AAA this season. In fact, Greene faced our own Norfolk Tides on June 5th and gave up eight runs in three innings. But in today's game against the team that the Tides are all hoping to get to, Greene didn't give up a hit until there were two outs in the fifth inning. After that the Orioles looked like they might finally do something against him, putting two runners on fifth and sixth innings. But ultimately they were unable to get the hit they needed with runners on base, and the kid that got lit up by the Tides one month ago pitched into the eighth inning without giving up a run. His final pitching line was 7 1/3, 4 H, 0 R, 2 BB, 9 K. Oof. Chris Tillman had what I'd call a middling day. He certainly did enough to keep his team in the game, but he was far from dominant. He walked three and threw a lot of waste pitches that didn't entice many swings. The damage could have been worse if the Yankees hadn't gotten two runners thrown out at the plate (though only one would have been charged to Tillman, in fairness). In the third inning, Mark Teixeira hit a two-out double down the right field line with Brett Gardner and Derek Jeter on base. Gardner scored easily, but Jeter, a 40-year-old man trying to score from first, was thrown out. In the seventh inning, which was Tillman's last, Kelly Johnson singled and moved to second base on a wild pitch, which made it easy for him to come in and score on a single by Jeter. Jeter went to second on the throw home, and that was the end of Tillman's day.    T.J. McFarland came in to pitch in relief, and it's kind of weird that he has become the go-to lefty in the pen. But when your best lefty has been designated as the closer and the only other lefty is Brian Matusz, I guess it makes sense. McFarland did not retire the lefty he came in to face, as Jacoby Ellsbury doubled to right field to knock in Jeter and make the score 3-0. McFarland then intentionally walked Teixeira to get to Brian McCann. That move worked out, but not in the way it was supposed to. McCann singled up the middle to Adam Jones, and Ellsbury was waved in to try and score. The throw to the plate wasn't even close Nick Hundley had the ball with plenty of time to spare. Joe Girardi came out to argue that Hundley was inappropriately blocking the plate (he wasn't, not even close). He waved at his players to stay on the field as the 7th inning stretch people got set up around them. Finally he chose not to challenge as someone began singing America the Beautiful behind him. He was still complaining about it to the umpire when we returned from commercial, because he is the worst. There was little action from either side after that, as Ryan Webb pitched two perfect innings for the Orioles and the Yankees used three relievers over the final 2 2/3, including a 1-2-3 9th from closer David Robertson.    So that game was a stinker, but tomorrow Kevin Gausman will take the mound as the Orioles try to wrap up the first half with a win. The game is on ESPN at 8 p.m.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

But necessity dictated that they pin their hopes on a 25-year-old whose background includes Tommy John surgery in college and a 15th-round selection by the Yankees in the 2009 draft.

These come across as very petty points in the moment during games.The Orioles went quietly in the ninth inning, and New York notched a 3-0 victory in game two of this series. Prior to the game the Birds made a roster move, sending Miguel Gonzalez down to triple-A Norfolk and recalling Baltimore-native Steve Clevenger.

The Yankees defeated the Orioles 3-0. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt has certainly been a pattern this season, and even stretching to previous years, that the Baltimore Orioles seem to have great difficulty with rookie pitchers or throwers they have never seen before.On Saturday afternoon at Camden Yards, the newest Cy Young-like rookie sensation was the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 Shane Greene, who shut down the Orioles for 7.1 innings on four hits along with nine strikeouts. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to end up ranting a bit here, but make no mistake about it, this young man was very, very good. At the end, the Yankees prevailed 3-0.Even though Greene was the Yankees organization\xe2\x80\x99s minor league pitcher of the year in 2013, his stats this season were not honestly that great. He was pitching to a 4.61 ERA at AAA, with a batting average against that was approaching .300.\xc2\xa0 The Orioles should be able to handle someone like this, right? Nope\xe2\x80\xa6 it is enough to make one wish that Masahiro Tanaka or C.C. Sabathia were back \xe2\x80\x93 those are guys the O\xe2\x80\x99s can handle and defeat!But Greene had some awesome stuff. I have to reluctantly, but honestly, say that it is one of the very best pitching efforts I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in recent years against the Baltimore Orioles. The kid was great. His slider was terrific \xe2\x80\x93 lots of late break that caught the strike zone at the last instant or darted under the bat on a swing.However, the Orioles helped him out a lot, not that he really needed it. Chris Davis looks as lost as any hitter I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in a long time. With 105 strikeouts on the season, he is making Mark Reynolds look like a contact hitter. Davis has a 32% chance of a strikeout when he steps to the plate. The batting average is down to .197.It also looks like there is some increasing reason for concern about Nelson Cruz. Like Davis, he also struck out three times in this game. Over the past week or so, Cruz has begun to chase low-and-away breaking pitches in the vein of Adam Jones over the years (though Adam has grown in his ability to resist these balls). Surely the scouts around the league are seeing this; therefore that is what Cruz is going to see. He will have to figure this out and make the adjustments.The 4-5-6 hitters for the Orioles were a collective 0-for-12 with nine strikeoouts!While we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about those who struck out three times today, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the next batter in the lineup \xe2\x80\x93 J.J. Hardy. So yes, if you are doing the math in your head, this means that the 4-5-6 hitters in the O\xe2\x80\x99s lineup were a collective 0-for-12 with nine strikeouts!! Hardy so often will swing at the worst pitch in any given at-bat. Today in his final appearance against Greene, he watched two balls break over the plate, and then he swung and missed a breaking ball over a foot outside.But I\xe2\x80\x99ve saved my worst vitriol for Ryan Flaherty. In the seventh inning, Greene was clearly about totally empty. This was the moment for the Orioles to get back into the game. With two outs (the second one being the Hardy strikeout described above), he walked Manny Machado on four pitches. He then threw two balls well out of the zone to Flaherty, bringing the pitching coach to the mound to buy time for the bullpen to warm up. Again\xe2\x80\xa6 doing that math \xe2\x80\x93 that is six consecutive balls. What should a batter do in this situation with the score 3-0? Maybe if your last name is Puig or Trout or Cano you get a green light \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe. Or maybe if you are even just a .250 contact hitter you get a green light \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe, but probably not. But really, do you swing at it if you are a platooned player batting .226?\xc2\xa0 No! Why? Because YOU MIGHT JUST HIT A GROUND BALL INTO THE SHIFT AND END THE INNING!More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterChris Tillman pitched a reasonably good game.

', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Orioles head into All-Star Break on wings of rain ...', "" When the Orioles called up Kevin Gausman to make Sunday's start, a complete game victory is the best thing that anyone could have hoped for. That's exactly what the Orioles got from Gausman as they beat the Yankees, 3-1, although the way it happened was not what anyone would have guessed. Thanks to rain, the teams only played through the top of the fifth. After a 2:20 delay the umpires finally ended it and let everyone head off to their All-Star Break plans. As one Baltimore writer quipped on Twitter, they were in danger of running into the first Home Run Derby where a player could not participate due to having a regular season game still going on. The delay lasted longer than the game itself. Things did not start out so smoothly in Gausman's latest return to the majors. He gave up a home run to Brett Gardner, the first batter he faced in the game, and ended up giving up hits to three of the first five batters he faced. It's a good thing for the Orioles that one of the hits did not result in a baserunner. Mark Teixeira hit a ball to the right field wall and decided to challenge Nick Markakis by going for a double. This was a poor decision in retrospect, as Teixeira was just slow enough and Markakis' throw in from right was just off the bag enough that J.J. Hardy came far off the bag to fetch the throw right as Teixeira was passing by.    With two outs, that ended the first inning, so when Brian McCann got a single himself, that was in the second inning. In fairness to Gausman, this single was the sole result of Manny Machado making a boneheaded play, giving up on a pop-up as it floated back into left field even though he appeared to signal to left fielder Steve Pearce that he'd caught the ball. The official scorer, generous as ever to hitters, scored the play as a hit.    Following that, Gausman retired 12 of the next 13 batters, with the lone hit being a third inning Derek Jeter single. Gausman did not walk a batter in this shortened outing. Those 13 batters took him to the end of the game, not that we knew it at the time. in Gausman's peculiar complete game, he went five innings, gave up four hits (but it was really only three), one run, no walks, and had two strikeouts. He threw 78 pitches. The Orioles didn't score until the fourth inning against Yankees starter Chase Whitley, who had a 14.80 ERA over his three previous starts. They loaded the bases in the second inning but it came with two outs, so a Jonathan Schoop fly ball to deep center did not have any material significance for the game's outcome. I heard that phrase on a World Cup game and just wanted to try it out, sorry.    The fourth inning breakout started, as many good things do, with a walk. It is, in general, a good idea in the year 2014 to maybe pitch around Nelson Cruz a little bit to get a chance to pitch to Chris Davis, who is real good at grounding into the shift. On a 1-1 pitch, Whitley threw a pitch around his shins and Davis went down and got it, driving it to the opposite field. Even this version of Davis is still a big, strong man; the ball flew to left and cleared the fence by a couple of feet for his 15th home run of the year. That gave the Orioles a 2-1 lead. Following the home run, Hardy went opposite field for a double. He would score two batters later on a single by Jonathan Schoop that went, you guessed it, to the opposite field - just over a jumping Brian Roberts. After the third Orioles run scored, Yankees manager Joe Girardi had seen enough of Whitley and pulled the plug. For once, the Orioles did damage to the guy they should beat.    The wind came during the pitching change, great gusts that sent garbage swirling across the Camden Yards infield. The radar was ominous, a lengthy delay was imminent. Markakis grounded out to reliever David Huff to send the game into the top of the fifth inning, after which the game would be official. You know this scenario almost never happens except in jokes. The team takes the lead just in time for the game to become official, then the rain arrives. On Sunday night, they had to get through one more half-inning, with winds blowing every direction at once. One wild pop-up in the top of the fifth looked like it changed directions three times on Markakis and he ended up falling over as he caught it. The flags in left-center billowed out, the flags on the flag court blew strongly to the right. It was wild. Every ball in the air was a reason to be nervous. Yangervis Solarte grounded out to third and with that, the game was official. Pearce led off the fifth inning with a walk, then the rains came in earnest. Though it took them a long time to get there, eventually, after midnight, the game was called and the Orioles were victorious. It's anticlimactic, but they all count the same in the standings. The rain-shortened win sends the Orioles into the All-Star Break with a 52-42 record and a lead of four games in the division over the second place Blue Jays, who lost earlier Sunday. The O's won seven of ten to close out the first half of the season. They needed every win they could get because they'll start off the second half of the season with a ten game West Coast road trip. Those are the good teams this year, and that's who the O's will have to beat on the road to maintain their place in the standings when the season resumes.    The next Orioles game is not until Friday at 10:05pm Eastern. Prepare yourself for the long haul. No one knows yet who's starting for the Orioles because like all of their starters are in the minor leagues, but O's hitters will be facing new Athletics acquisition Jeff Samardzija.

That was good for second place among the AL hitters in the round, ahead of Cespedes, Josh Donaldson, and Brian Dozier. The bottom two hitters in each league were dropped after one round.

07/15/2014,"[('Get to know your Orioles: Nelson Cruz - Camden Chat', ' All the pundits called it a ""steal"". Nelson Cruz for $8 million? There is no way this can go wrong. A thousand analysts can\'t be wrong. Oh yeah...they weren\'t. He has been a smashing success, second in the league in both home runs and RBI. But Cruz was no overnight phenom in the baseball world. It was a long windy road. Bio Name: Nelson Ramon Cruz Number: 23Born: July 1, 1980 (34 years old) in Las Matas de Santa Cruz, Dominican RepublicHeight: 6\'2"" Weight: 230 lbsBats: Rightt Throw: RightSigned: As an amateur free agent by the New York Mets on February 17,1998School: Monte Crisit, DOContract: $8,000,000 in 2014 (Free agent this offseason)Became an Oriole: Signed as a free agent on February 24, 2014Walk-up Song: ""Para Ti"" by: Juan Luis GuerraTwitter: @ncboomstick23 Cruz is from the north western part of the Dominican Republic; very close to the Haitian border. He shares his first name with his father. Together with Dominga, Nelson\'s mother, the elder Cruz raised three children: Nelson and his two sisters; Olga and Nelsy (man, they REALLY like the name Nelson). They lived in a rented home with three beds between the five of them. Both Dominga and Nelson Sr. were teachers; Dominga, elementary school; Nelson, high school social studies. Nelson\'s middle name comes from his grandfather, Ramon. He was a farmer who raised cows, bulls and rice. It had such an impact on Cruz as a child that he now owns a farm in the Dominican.    As a boy, Cruz would split time between school, his grandfather\'s farm and his uncle\'s auto shop. It was basically anything his father could get him to do to keep busy and out of trouble.    ""If you don\'t have free time, you don\'t have time to do wrong,"" Nelson Sr. recently told the Baltimore Sun. Despite all of this, the Orioles All-Star had time for sports. His favorite? Basketball. He chose hoops over hardball because he worked long hours, six days a week. When he was finally off it was dark out. The fields near him had no lights and no teams met on Sundays, his one day off. The courts, however, did have lights.    It wasn\'t until Nelson was a teenager, nearly out of school, that he played baseball regularly. It didn\'t take long for scouts to notice his ability. Mets\' scout Eddy Toledo approached Nelson and told him he wanted to see him play. The future Major Leaguer struck out three times the game Toledo attended, but it wasn\'t enough to keep him away. They got to work on a deal. The only thing that halted talks was Nelson Sr.\'s insistence that the younger Cruz finish high school before training with the Mets minor leaguers in the Dominican. They would work things out and put pen to paper, making Cruz a professional. After that, things got difficult for Cruz. In fact he wouldn\'t even leave the Dominican in a Mets uniform. He played there for parts of three seasons and, despite hitting .351 with 15 home runs in 2000, New York felt he wasn\'t progressing enough and sent him to Oakland in exchange for Jorge Velandia.    The Athletics organization really let him put his mark on minor league baseball, climbing from the Arizona Fall league to Triple-A Sacramento in parts of four years. However, he saw just four games of action in Sactown in 2004. It\'s possible that Oakland felt his development was taking a bit too long. Whatever the reason, he was sent to Milwaukee along with Justin Lehr in a trade for Keith Ginter. From there, he would tear through the Brewers double-A opponents and hit well enough in Triple-A to get his first cup of Major League coffee with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2005. But it was only eight games as a September call-up. He would start the 2006 season at Triple-A Nashville for the Brewers until the season\'s trade deadline approached. In a fairly big blockbuster move at the time, Milwaukee sent both Cruz and Carlos Lee to Texas in a swap for Laynce Nix, Kevin Mench, Francisco Cordero, and Julian Cordero. Cruz would get his first crack at a full time gig in the bigs. It wouldn\'t last as he showed big power but poor discipline at the plate. It caused him to yo-yo between the minors and majors for the next two seasons. He was too good for a farm team, but just couldn\'t hack it with the big club. I mean, look at this: the Rangers brought him up in 2007 for 96 games. While there he slashed .235/.287/.384 with 9 home runs, 34 RBI, 21 walks, and 87 strikeouts. With Triple-A Oklahoma City that same season he slashed .352/.428/.698 with 15 home runs and 45 RBI in 44 games. It was night and day.    Texas had lost so much hope that in 2008 he was placed on waivers. Any team could have had him for $20,000. No takers, and it\'s a good thing for the Rangers. Over the next season he would establish himself as a regular; a fixture in a team that would go to the playoffs three straight years from 2010 to 2012, winning the pennant twice. And then, 2013 happened. Cruz was tabbed as one of those involved in the Biogenesis scandal. The same investigation that nabbed Ryan Braun and Alex Rodriguez for lengthy suspensions. It was an unfortunate chain of events that Cruz claimed to be involved with to rehabilitate from a gastrointestinal infection that caused him to lose 40 pounds. Evidence to the contrary, such as an incongruent timeline of Cruz\'s purchase of drugs and his recovery, lead some to Whatever the case, it left Cruz as an unknown commodity come this past winter. Something that the Orioles took advantage off. If you are reading this, you are well aware of that. Aside from Biogenesis, Cruz appears to be very successful off the field. He has been married to his wife Solanyi for nearly five years. The two tied the knot on Christmas Day in 2009. They have two children; a son, 5-year-old Nelson (again with all these Nelsons), and a daughter, 1-year-old Jiara. The three live in a downtown apartment that they are renting for the season. They will all be cheering him on as he bats sixth for the AL squad in tonight\'s All-Star game, right in front of teammate Adam Jones.    Maybe this is the only season he will be in Oriole black and orange, but he is making it one to remember.

07/16/2014,"[('Here comes the hard part for the first-place Orioles ...', "" The Orioles finished out in a pretty good place going into the All-Star Break. \xc2\xa010 games above .500. \xc2\xa0Four games ahead in the A.L. East. \xc2\xa0The rest of the division falling apart. \xc2\xa0These were great times to be an Orioles fan. Well, I have some bad news. \xc2\xa0The hard part is about to start. Going by pre-All Star Break records, the Orioles won't even see a .500 team until they play the Yankees on August 11th. \xc2\xa0They won't see a sub-.500 team until they face the White Sox on August 18th. The birds kick off the season's second half with ten road games against excellent AL West teams, most of which start at 1 a.m. Eastern (which is annoying for viewers as well as players). \xc2\xa0Three in Oakland, three in Anaheim and four in Seattle. \xc2\xa0Those three teams are a combined 167-117 (.588) with a cumulative +291 run differential (admittedly, Oakland drives a lot of that). \xc2\xa0Only mildly comforting is the fact that the Orioles have been better on the road than at home so far.    The Orioles zip back from the west coast to play ... the Angels and Mariners, in Baltimore, from July 29-August 3. \xc2\xa0Then they squeeze in a makeup game against the Nationals (51-42) before shooting up to the great white north for a series against Toronto (49-47), then returning to Camden Yards to play the Cardinals (52-44) before getting to that Yankees series. That's 23 games. \xc2\xa023 brutal games. \xc2\xa0The Orioles only have 68 left to play, and the first 23 are that run of matchups, with only one off day. So, Orioles fans, buckle up. \xc2\xa0This team's not going to be able to skate by on a four-game lead to close out the season, not even with the rest of the division limping along. \xc2\xa0They're going to have to earn some tough wins against some quality competition.    If they can get out of that 23-game stretch with a lead in the A.L. East, though, they'll be poised to make a run. \xc2\xa0When that stretch ends, their toughest competition the rest of the way is the Cincinnati Reds. \xc2\xa0They mix up ample intradivision matchups (they're 26-18 against the division so far) with some chances against lesser teams like the Twins and White Sox. So mark your calendars. \xc2\xa0The Orioles' record on August 11th will probably be important.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles promote Mike Yastrzemski to Double-A Bowie ...', ' While the major league team has a few days off, the Orioles have bumped some of their prospects closer towards the big leagues. On Wednesday afternoon, the O\'s announced that outfielder Mike Yastrzemski has been promoted to Double-A Bowie. Yastrzemski started the season off at Low-A Delmarva and will now be playing at his third level of the season. This is an impressive leap within one season, although it is important to remember that the O\'s drafted Yastrzemski from Vanderbilt as a senior in the 14th round last year. That means that the 23-year-old, in prospect terms, has been old for every level at which he has played. Still, even for a fringe guy, to break out and earn two promotions in a year is something to hang your hat on. Yastrzemski was clearly ready to move on from Delmarva, batting .306/.365/.554 over 63 games. That includes double digit doubles, triples, and home runs. Wait a minute, it\'s possible for a guy to hit ten triples? In his 23 game stop at High-A Frederick, he batted .312/.364/.462, continuing to showcase speed. He is believed to be the only player in all of professional baseball with double digit doubles, triples, home runs, stolen bases, and outfield assists. A left-handed batting outfielder who has demonstrated some speed and arm strength and even a little power. What a concept. Yastrzemski is listed at 5\'11"" and 180 lbs.    It\'s still a long way from Bowie to the big leagues, and Yastrzemski will have to prove himself at this latest level in order to continue to move forward. The draft is littered with players whose professional baseball destiny will never take them higher than A-ball. That\'s even more true for senior signs, who, if they had much prospect hype left, would probably be drafted and signed as juniors. Yastrzemski actually was drafted as a junior, in the 30th round in 2012, but he turned down $300,000 from the Mariners to finish his Vanderbilt career. Seattle\'s loss is Baltimore\'s gain for now. Should he continue to perform with the Baysox, his name will start popping up in conversations as a future contributor for the big league club.

I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into detail about that situation as it\xe2\x80\x99s been well documented here on Birds Watcher, the fact that the teams are meeting again is noteworthy.The obvious question is whether or not there will be any backlash involving the two teams and/or Machado directly. On one hand, one might argue that it\xe2\x80\x99s the Orioles who have the ball in their court on that. After all, Machado was in fact the last player to be hit in the sequence of events. However let\xe2\x80\x99s also not forget that this is an Oriole team that\xe2\x80\x99s in a pennant race right now \xe2\x80\x93 as is Oakland.  Does it not stand to reason that both teams seemingly have a lot to lose? You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall a few weeks ago when Boston\xe2\x80\x99s John Lackey made a few veiled comments about Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s suspension for PED\xe2\x80\x99s. At the time, I\xc2\xa0tweeted\xc2\xa0that the Orioles needed to be careful not to get into anything with Boston. Bad teams will often try to start something with good teams so as to throw them off. In this case, both teams are good. However the fact is that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are in a much more precarious position than is Oakland given the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re on the opposite coast. This is a huge road trip for the Birds, and they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to have outside distractions.I would suspect that Manny Machado won\xe2\x80\x99t be received particularly well by the Oakland fans.

If I were the umpires for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game, I\xe2\x80\x99d consider doing that. Both managers would probably argue that it would take their pitchers\xe2\x80\x99 ability away to pitch inside, however it might also dissuade anyone from doing anything regrettable.And regardless of what anyone thinks of Machado coming out of that unfortunate incident, it should be noted that he handled himself as well as he could in the aftermath. Not only has he played well, but he also sat his suspension without opening his mouth further and left it at that. I would submit that there might well have been more than meets the eye in that incident. I can speak from experience in that I\xe2\x80\x99ve flung my share of bats at people in my life when I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to my wit\xe2\x80\x99s end about a given situation. By that I mean that I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to a point where I\xe2\x80\x99ve snapped and done or said regrettable things.

Not that this was the fault and/or problem of Josh Donaldson or anyone on Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s team, however I suppose what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that I recognize the symptoms. In terms of his play on the field, after that incident was over it\xe2\x80\x99s been like a weight was lifted off of Machado\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders.So my advice to the Orioles is to stay cool this weekend. Certainly if multiple Oriole batters start getting hit, that might need to be evaluated again, however I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that to happen (neither that nor the inverse). In fact if I were the Orioles I\xe2\x80\x99d tell Machado not to even talk to the media during this series, so as to not have anything misconstrued as a negative comment towards the opponent or even the fans. As I said, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be boo\xe2\x80\x99d royally this weekend, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to deal with. But the less that incident is brought up or referenced by Machado and the Orioles, the better. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles sign one last draft pick as deadline passes: 33rd ...', "" We were all sweating out the deadline to sign 2014 draft picks on Friday afternoon with the Orioles still having 33rd round pick Brandon Koch unsigned, but fret no longer. The Orioles signed the right-handed pitcher right around the 5pm deadline, giving them 31 signed draftees out of the 38 picks that they made in the draft. There was no immediate word about what kind of signing bonus Koch received. The O's could offer him up to $100,000 without any of the bonus counting against their draft bonus pool, with any amount over $100,000 counting against the pool. However, the Orioles reportedly used up nearly all of their pool money in signing their rounds 3-10 picks, so they probably didn't have much to offer Koch. Since 2012, then the hard slot value system was introduced, the Orioles have signed 30+ draft picks every year. They signed 30 of their 40 picks in 2012 and 31 of 41 picks in 2013. They signed all of their first 16 picks of this year's draft, starting with third-rounder Brian Gonzalez, who was the first player they picked this year. The most notable of their unsigned players is 25th round pick Brandon Bonilla, the son of former Oriole Bobby Bonilla.

Olesczuk CF Winthrop    Most all of these picks have already gotten their pro careers started with either the Gulf Coast League Orioles or the Aberdeen Ironbirds.    The Orioles signed only four high schoolers, but they picked only eight to begin with. The only high school player they picked in the top ten rounds was their third rounder, Brian Gonzalez. One simple truth of the draft is that most of these names will end up turning into nothing, because they're drafted largely with the intent of being organizational filler. However, you never know who might develop something new once they get into the professional ranks. Even Albert Pujols, the game's greatest player for several years, was a lowly 13th round pick. That's a longshot for any one player. The Orioles would probably be happy if one of these lower-round picks turns into the next Mike Yastrzemski, a 14th round pick who's jumped two levels just this season and is now tackling Double-A Bowie.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThere have been so many strange features about the 2014 season for the Baltimore Orioles. Among these is the difficulty the O\xe2\x80\x99s have faced with winning games at home. They finally put themselves in positive numbers over the final homestretch, as their 52-42 record breaks down to 26-23 at home and 26-19 on the road.Another strange feature is the number of times the Oriole were pretty much shut down effectively by young, rookie pitchers that they had not seen before. But the Birds were able to beat Masahiro Tanaka, Justin Verlander, Jon Lester, Clay Buchholz, R.A. Dickey, and Mark Buehlre among others.So, maybe it is a good thing that the Orioles start out the final 68-game push on the road, facing the best team in baseball (by current record) in the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s, doing so in their total crap stadium, and seeing Jeff Samardzija throw against them. (I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ve never typed his name before and I pasted it into the article! I wonder how old he was before he learned how to spell his last name.)Samardzija has, of course, recently come to the A\xe2\x80\x99s from the Chicago Cubs, after having had a tremendous start to his 2014 season. At the time of the trade, he was 2-7 with a 2.83 ERA. In his two games with Oakland he is 1-1, giving up only four runs on nine hits in 15 innings.However, over the six full seasons with the Cubs from 2008-2013, he was a combined 29-35 with a 4.19 ERA and WHIP of 1.355.\xc2\xa0 These are not terrible numbers, since they were done with, yes, a terrible team; but they are, at best, rather ordinary.So, the bad news is that few Orioles have ever batted against him. Nick Hundley is 1-for-7, while Steve Pearce is 0-for-4 and J.J. Hardy hitless in two attempts.But the news for Oakland batters against Baltimore Orioles starter Chris Tillman is not much better. They are a combined 7-for-49 (.143), and Tillman is 1-0 over 18.1 innings against the A\xe2\x80\x99s with 18 strikeouts. For the season, Tillman is currently 7-5 with a 4.11 ERA in 20 starts.More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterThe series will also feature the first reunion of Manny Machado with the A\xe2\x80\x99s since the infamous bat-throwing incident.

Alvarez doubled in four trips and Walker...uh, walked three times in five plate appearances. Getting in his work with the youngsters, Miguel Gonzalez pitched a workmanlike quality start. Nothin to see here. One of our regular commenters posted a nice first person account\xc2\xa0here. Bowie Baysox 8, Altoona Curve 5 Eduardo Rodriguez dug a hole for the Baysox and the offense climbed out. Rodriguez allowed five earned runs in 4.2 innings, but Mike Yastrzemski and Chris Marrero led mini rallies in the eighth and ninth to help the Baysox to their 51st win of the season. Though not a prospect, Marrero, the former first rounder doubled and homered, but the night belonged to AA debutante Yastrzemski. The thoroughbred from Vanderbilt went 4-5, including a triple and two runs. Garabez Rosa continued his solid season with a homer and a single. Johnny Ruettiger also had a a pair of singles and a steal. Ruettiger has only stolen seven bases this year after taking 44 last year and 28 the previous year.    Frederick Keys 5, Salem Red Sox 3 Brady Wager is not a guy that earns a lot of style points on the mound, but he's probably one of the best sinkerballers in the system. This season, Wager has pitched to a 57% groundball rate. The only time he's achieved a higher rate in his career, was in half as many starts at Delmarva last year. In his start against the Red Sox, Wager induced seven groundouts in five innings and allowed three earned runs. Dennis Torres, a relative newcomer to the Keys earned the four inning save shutting the Red Sox out the rest of the way.    It might be sort of damning with faint praise to say that Jason Esposito has had one of his best offensive seasons in the system this year. After all, the 2011 second round pick is nearly 24 and has logged almost 700 at bats at Frederick without breaking through. He's shown some value this season, though, as a bit of lefty masher, slashing .333/.383/.488 against lefties this year. On this night, Esposito doubled off of righty Pat Light. Wynston Sawyer also walked twice to raise his July OBP to .357 and Glynn Davis stole his 19th base of the year. Catching for the Red Sox, was Jordan Weems, brother of former O's farmhand Chase Weems.    Delmarva Shorebirds 5, Greensboro Grasshoppers 0 I still have no real idea who Luis Gonzalez is. I feel safe in saying, however, that he's good enough for the Sally League. Gonzalez has allowed two or fewer earned runs in eight of his ten starts. He doesn't seem to have an arsenal chock full of swing and miss stuff, but struck out five Grasshoppers and induced eight groundouts. Austin Urban and Big Jon Keller helped preserve the shutout. Keller has struck out 66 batters in 56.2 innings. Drew Dosch and Creede Simpson doubled while Austin Wynns had three singles. Wynns might be a sleeper catching prospect. Wynns has thrown out 35% of would be base thiefs and has only been charged with two errors. If you're a believer in baseball-reference's range factor, he rates well there, too (8.81). He's had a really nice July at the plate (.457/.524/.486) and his .329 OBP on the year is a nice improvement over his .284 2013 season. Aberdeen Ironbirds 4, Tri City ValleyCats 6 The Veloz giveth and the Veloz taketh away. Young Hector doubled, walked twice an stole a base, but also was charged with two errors and ruined an otherwise decent outing by Pat Connaugton.

Jamill Moquete was 3-3 with a steal and Jay Gonzalez stole his ninth base and walked three times. Rookie League Notes    Break 'em up! A day after scoring 23 runs, the DSL O's Dos scored 16 runs.

Phelps was the offensive hero of the night as he had three hits, including a solo home run that accounted for the Tides' other run. CF Dariel Alvarez and 1B Christian Walker each singled in four plate appearances. Josh Stinson started for the Tides and gave up both runs, though just one was earned. He struck out two and walked two in six innings. Brock Hutzinger pitched two scoreless innings and Robert Coello (a newcomer formerly of the Scranton/WB Rail Riders), pitched the final inning . Bowie Baysox 0, Altoona Curve 3 The Baysox got just one hit last night. It was a double from Mike Yastrzemski, because of course it was. Kid can hit! Keyong Kang also walked and Niuman Romero reached on an error. Anthony Vasquez gave up three runs in five innings. He walked three, which isn't great. Jake Pettit and Mychal Givens pitched three scoreless to finish the game.    Frederick Keys 4, Salem Red Sox 2 Parker Bridwell gave up just four hits in seven-plus innings, but he also walked four. He started the game shaky but then retired 12 batters in a row leading up to the eighth inning. He started the eighth with a walk and a single and was pulled from the game. The walk came around to score. So an up-and-down night for Bridwell to say the least.    On offense, SS Adrian Marin had three hits and CF Glynn Davis doubled and singled. LF Michael Burgess also doubled. Delmarva Shorebirds 8, Hagerstown Suns 3 The Shorebirds had 17 hits in the contest, and it was something of a singles party with only two extra base hits, both doubles. 2B Josh Kemp had three hits, SS Jared Breen went hitless with a walk, and every other batter in the lineup had two hits. That includes DH Chance Sisco, C Austin Wynns, and RF Anthony Vega.    On top of all that, it was Hunter Harvey night! Harvey was awesome, as is so often the case. In five innings pitched he threw 71 pitches and gave up no runs on just two hits. He didn't walk a batter, he struck out eight, and he had a 5/1 groundout to flyout ratio. Someone promote that kid!

There won't be any waiting for us to get over it, though. The Orioles are back in action at 9:05 Eastern time. All we can do is hope that it's not last year's Arizona series all over again. The O's are starting out in a better place in the standings than they did with that Arizona series, to be sure. But losing all three of these games would still be quite deflating.

On the whole, Hammel has been looking more like the surprise guy from 2012 in Baltimore than the awful one from 2013 in Baltimore. Even better, really, because he's been pitching to inferior National League lineups for most of his starts this season. That was enough to make him a tantalizing trade piece, and now here he is in Oakland, pitching against his former team. This will actually be Hammel's first start against an AL team since the trade, because his first start in an Oakland uniform came against the Giants. Wherever you go, there you are.

Though the Oakland stadium is a cavernous expanse, that doesn't stop good hitters from launching mistakes, or even good pitches, far into the seats, as we discovered last night, with eight of the game's nine runs scoring across four home runs. No one on the Athletics has faced Chen more than nine times. Derek Norris and Josh Donaldson have both homered off Chen in their limited action against him.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsYesterday, the Baltimore Orioles took a two-run lead into the bottom of the ninth against the Oakland Athletics. Given that Zach Britton \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0the former club\xe2\x80\x99s closer \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0had a 1.30 ERA prior to the All-Star break, many fans on the East coast went to bed, for they expected the game to end with the score static. These fans (of whom I am one) woke up to a rude surprise: Britton allowed a three-run home run to Josh Donaldson, leading to a 5-4 Baltimore loss.As is generally the case following a blown save, the irrational section of the fanbase will demand changes. Because said blown save occurred during trade season, many of these demands will come in the form of suggestions for hypothetical deals \xe2\x80\x94 in this instance, for a relief pitcher. In the past few days, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen two contenders make upgrades to their bullpens. On Wednesday, the Texas Rangers shipped Jason Frasor to the Kansas City Royals; then yesterday,\xc2\xa0the Los Angeles Angels received Huston Street from the San Diego Padres. If the Orioles wish to fend off the Toronto Blue Jays in the race for the AL East crown, they\xe2\x80\x99ll need every advantage they can get. But do the Orioles have to import an arm, and if so, whom should they import?As it stands right now, Baltimore has two elite relievers: Britton, and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day.\xc2\xa0Yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meltdown notwithstanding, Britton has pitched exceptionally this year, with a 1.86 ERA in 48.1 innings. O\xe2\x80\x99Day has been even better, as his ERA sits at an unfathomable 1.11 in 40.2 innings. Britton has peripheral improvement to support this, as his 2.07 SIERA ranks 16th-best out of 152 qualifying relievers; while O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s peripherals aren\xe2\x80\x99t as astounding (his 2.69 SIERA ranks 38th), he has made a career out of overperforming, and I see no reason why he should stop now.Behind those two, though, things become a little shaky. Ryan Webb has had his ups and downs in his debut season in Baltimore; the net outcomes, while respectable (3.18 ERA, 2.92 SIERA in 39.2 innings), are nothing particularly special. Tommy Hunter\xe2\x80\x98s performance has fluctuated even more, as he has bounced from closer to mop-up man to middle reliever; as with Webb, his stats (3.82 ERA, 3.29 SIERA in 33.0 innings) don\xe2\x80\x99t turn any heads. Brad Brach and T.J. McFarland have subpar peripherals (3.93 and 3.88 SIERAs in 33.0 and 31.1 innings, respectively) to accompany decent results (3.27 and 3.16 ERAs respectively), and Brian Matusz has melted down (4.68 ERA, 4.08 SIERA in 32.2 innings) after a successful 2013.So the Orioles could probably use some help in the bullpen, especially considering the ineffectiveness of their starting rotation. But for which pitchers can they trade?Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the options. The most prominent candidate is Jonathan Papelbon, whom the Philadelphia Phillies would like to unload, along with the rest of his 4-year, $50 million contract. He wants out, too, and the Orioles have expressed interest in him. On the surface, he has dominated this year, to the tune of a 1.21 ERA in 37.1 innings. However, that number belies a more mediocre 3.18 SIERA\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 not much of an upgrade from the MLB-wide relief average of 3.42. The latter number is no fluke: Papelbon has seen his velocity decline for several years now, which has caused his advanced stats to suffer. ERA and other basic metrics don\xe2\x80\x99t show it yet, but Papelbon isn\xe2\x80\x99t significantly better than the average reliever; for $12.5 million in this year and next, the Orioles should stay away at all costs.Other, more reasonable options do exist. While the Padres and Rangers have already sent relievers to World Series hopefuls, they have more chips\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 namely, Joaquin Benoit and Joakim Soria. Both have excelled this year: Benoit has a 2.04 ERA, to go along with a 2.42 SIERA, while Soria\xe2\x80\x99s 1.61 SIERA substantiates a 2.59 ERA; moreover, neither has a ridiculous contract to hinder any potential movements.\xc2\xa0However, the Orioles might have to focus solely on Soria, as Benoit could stay put.\xc2\xa0The Padres have said that they want to keep either Street or Benoit; since they dealt the former, they will probably hold on to the latter.Soria is an interesting case. He has had a career year thus far for the worst-in-the-majors Rangers, as the aforementioned 1.61 SIERA blows his previous career low (2.37 in 2009) out of the water. He has struck out an obscene 34.2% of the batters he\xe2\x80\x99s faced, while only walking a measly 3.3%; plus, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0nor has he ever had \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0a platoon split to speak of. As such, many teams have expressed interest in acquiring his services. If the Orioles can get their hands on him, he would certainly assist them in their hunt for October.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 phenomenal relief pitching sparked their surprising 2012 season and subsequent playoff run. In 2013, the bullpen was more average, as it has been so far in 2014. Obviously, swapping out Matusz or another scrub for Soria can only improve matters, but trades for one-year wonders haven\xe2\x80\x99t worked well for the Orioles in the recent past. We all remember the disastrous Francisco Rodriguez trade of last year, in which Baltimore sacrificed a solid prospect for a reliever with a hot start that melted down upon arriving in Charm City.In general, most baseball cognoscenti agree that trades for relievers don\xe2\x80\x99t end well; peraps, for this reason, the Orioles should stay pat, or at least spend their resources elsewhere.All statistics courtesy of Baseball-Reference\xc2\xa0and FanGraphs.

Granted, the O\xe2\x80\x99s managed to blow a 5-1 lead that day in the last of the ninth inning which is much different than what we saw Friday, however it was still a dramatic loss that probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened. Not that things were going that great prior to that day, however I\xe2\x80\x99ve always felt as if that game really set the tone for the struggles that the Birds ended up having that year.Every team in baseball is going to lose games in walk off fashion. When it happens that team is challenged to put it out of their minds so that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t turn into another loss, another after that, and so forth. The best way to avoid something like that snowballing is to win your next game out. Last night, the Baltimore Orioles answered that call as they defeated Oakland 8-4. Wei-Yin Chen only made it through five innings, and while I suspect he still had something left Buck Showalter wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to run that risk. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, \xc2\xa0H, 3 R, 1 BB, 4 K. Chen produced several long fly ball outs which might have been interesting at Camden Yards, but in a park like Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s ended up in outfielders\xe2\x80\x99 mitts.The Baltimore Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t wasting any time in\xc2\xa0answering the call\xc2\xa0last night; they started right up from the get go. Nick Markakis led off with a single in the first, which was followed by a Steve Pearce walk. That brought Adam Jones to the plate, and he promptly gave the BirdsCourtesy of Bob Stanton-USA TODAY Sportsa 3-0 lead with a home run to left field. Later with two outs in the inning, J.J. Hardy added a solo shot and after a half inning the O\xe2\x80\x99s led 4-0.Chris Davis would add an RBI-double in the third, and suddenly the O\xe2\x80\x99s had chased their former teammate Jason Hammel from the game. Hammel of course was traded to Oakland from the Chicago Cubs a few weeks ago. However keep in mind that Oakland is a team that believes it\xe2\x80\x99s never out of a game, similar to the Orioles. So for the entire game the O\xe2\x80\x99s were seemingly on edge in hopes that they could record the third out in the ninth inning before Oakland somehow came back \xe2\x80\x93 and with good reason, as Brandon Moss cut the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead to 5-1 with a solo homer in the last of the third.However again, these Orioles truly answered the call last night. In the wake of Oakland thinking they had gained some momentum back, Adam Jones came up with one out and two runners in scoring position in the fourth. In recording his fourth and fifth RBI of the night, Jones sent a two-RBI single to center field and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were on top 7-1. But what did I say above? \xe2\x80\x93 Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s a team who thinks they\xe2\x80\x99re never out of it. Lowrie\xe2\x80\x99s two-RBI double in the last of the inning brought the Oriole lead back to four at 7-3.As I alluded above, Buck Showalter lifted Chen before he could tire out and get himself in any trouble. The short outings are one frustration that the O\xe2\x80\x99s have with Chen, although while he was in the game he was fairly solid. \xc2\xa0But the Orioles also got two incredibly solid innings out of Brad Brach, who gave up one run on another Lowrie RBI (single) in the sixth.One thing we haven\xe2\x80\x99t always seen from these O\xe2\x80\x99s this year is insurance runs, but Chris Davis provided that with a solo home run in the top of the ninth, running the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead to 8-4. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day recorded two outs in the last of the ninth, before things got just a bit interesting. He issued a two-out walk to Brandon Moss before giving up a \xe2\x80\x9cbroken bat dying quail\xe2\x80\x9d single to Stephen Vogt. Sound familiar? When you\xe2\x80\x99re a team like Oakland and you\xe2\x80\x99re at home in front of your fans (who seem to pride themselves in staying loud by way of a Brazian soccer-syle samba party every game), if you get a couple of runners on in the ninth inning you start to believe. However Zach Britton came on to record the final out, which he did by striking out Nick Punto.Again, this is a big win for the Orioles because they managed to get the foul taste of Friday night out of their mouths. When you\xe2\x80\x99re in a pennant race as tough as that in which the Orioles find themselves, you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to drop several games in a row. The entire division won yesterday also, thus the Birds didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose any ground.Kevin Gausman will start the series finale this afternoon for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s Sonny Gray. The Orioles will have to make a roster move at some point after today\xe2\x80\x99s game, probably optioning a reliever to the minors. Bud Norris is scheduled to start tomorrow night in Anaheim, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll need to be recalled in order to do so. Incidentally, the O\xe2\x80\x99s weren\xe2\x80\x99t happy in the least about the three hit batsmen on Friday night; it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go unnoticed that two of the players that were hit (Jones and Hardy) each went yard in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles bounce back with 8-4 win over Athletics; Adam ...', "" The best way to get over a tough loss is to win. The Orioles came out on Saturday night firing with both barrels, scoring four runs between a pair of first inning home runs off former Oriole Jason Hammel. They added on runs as the game went on, runs they'd end up needing, ending up with a deceptively close 8-4 victory over the Athletics in the second game of the series. Revenge is a dish best served 23 hours later. The O's had much to avenge on Saturday, the tough loss being only one part of it. There was also the fact that they were hit three times by pitches on Friday, including one pitch to J.J. Hardy's head and another that hit Adam Jones in the shoulder, very near to his head. The best way to get even for something like that is, contrary to faux-macho doctrine, not plunking someone else, but on the scoreboard. Jones and Hardy had their revenge before the first inning was even over. Jones batted with two men on and none out and he crushed a ball to left field to open up the scoring festivities. That was the 17th home run of the year for Jones, giving the Orioles a 3-0 lead. Two batters later, Hardy launched one to left field as well, a solo shot for his fourth homer of the season. The O's led 4-0 after the first half frame. For the second straight night, the team teed off for home runs against Oakland's prized starter acquisitions. Hammel in particular looked more like 2013 Jason Hammel than the version who'd been pitching in Chicago all season. It's almost like when you take an NL pitcher and put him in the AL, there are going to be adjustments to be made.    Things were even worse for Hammel than for Jeff Samardzija on Friday. Hammel was chased from the game without recording an out in the third inning. It was a starting pitching performance reminiscent of Tommy Hunter in that role in one key area: Five Runs, All Earned. An RBI double from Chris Davis chased Hammel from the game. A's reliever Dan Otero stranded runners at second and third with none out to limit the damage.    As the batting order turned over, the O's showed Otero who was the boss, and it wasn't Tony Danza. A single from Nick Markakis, who ended up 4-5 on the night, followed by a double from Steve Pearce, once again set up second and third. This time, however, the batter was not Nick Hundley, who ruined the third inning chance with a GIDP. It was, instead, Jones, whom you know, if you've been paying attention, is the man. Jones's shoulder was not yet avenged. He cracked a single up the middle, scoring two runs and giving him five RBI for the game. That set the Orioles to a 7-1 lead, more than they would ultimately need, although it did come closer than it needed to in the end. Just for laughs, Jones stole second base, although he did not come around to score.    Staked to such a lead, you might hope for a deep outing from the Orioles starter, but alas, this was Wei-Yin Chen's night to start. His effort was enough to win if only because the Orioles batters hammered Hammel. Chen gave up a solo home run to Brandon Moss for the first Oakland run, and allowed two more runs in a long Oakland fourth inning that pushed up Chen's pitch count. After five innings, with Chen having allowed three runs on five hits and a walk, and more importantly, with his pitch count entering the Chen Danger zone at 86 pitches, that was enough for O's manager Buck Showalter, who summoned Brad Brach to hold the line. Brach was good for two innings, giving up a run thanks to a double from Josh Donaldson, who came around to score on a single by Jed Lowrie. That was Lowrie's third RBI of the night. That's cute.    In all, the Orioles had 13 hits in the game, and, unusually for them, they walked five times. In addition to Markakis, the O's got multi-hit games from Pearce (3-4), Jones (2-4), and Davis (2-4). The top six batters in the lineup each had at least one hit. One advantage for the Orioles in chasing Hammel so early is that they increased their chances of bringing the game into Jim Johnson territory. During the 2012 season, you wanted every game to get into Johnson territory. Those days are long gone. His awful performance this year has led him to be the most garbage of garbage men. Johnson quickly showed why, giving up a leadoff homer to Davis, then walking Hardy. The insurance run was enough that Showalter did not automatically summon Zach Britton at the top of the ninth inning, preferring to try to have Darren O'Day, who'd pitched a scoreless eighth, finish the game. O'Day got two outs into the ninth before his fortune ran thin. A walk to Moss and a single to Stephen Vogt later and O'Day was out of there. If the lead was 7-4, you would have sweated more with what would have been the tying run at the plate, especially when Britton opened up with a 3-0 count on Nick Punto. Britton dialed it up and Punto looked at a couple of strikes before swinging through the third strike to end the game, with the tying run stuck on deck. It was a less comfortable 8-4 win than most, but after Friday night, we know not to get greedy about wins. The rest of the division all won on Saturday, so the O's hold their place four games up on both Toronto and New York.    Sunday will bring the rubber game of this three-game series, with a 4:05 Eastern scheduled start time. Kevin Gausman starts for the O's, with Sonny Gray getting the ball for the Athletics.

""There were six replays today. We got them all right.""That\'s been the mantra and the rationale from the beginning: Get the call right.The consensus midway through the first season of using replay for much more than disputed home runs is that baseball got \xe2\x80\x94 or at least is getting \xe2\x80\x94 it right.The system itself remains under constant review, though Selig says, ""We had no right to expect it would be this good this fast.

Just more than half of the calls are being reversed. And the average time of review has gradually declined to less than two minutes.""They prepared us that there might be a hiccup or two and to kind of bear with it,"" says Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona. ""And I think they\'re constantly trying to see how they can make it better. I think it\'s been pretty good.""Managers had challenged 606 calls in heading into the All-Star break \xe2\x80\x94 that\'s once every 2.35 games. Of those, 52% (318) were overturned.Joe Torre, Major League Baseball\'s executive vice president of baseball operations, cites a 47.7% overturn rate, but that includes reviews initiated by umpires, mostly the home run disputes.One statistic not included in the detailed data MLB keeps is how often a manager walks onto the field to indicate he might want to challenge, then changes his mind during the 30 seconds or so he is informally given to await a signal from his own video reviewer as to whether the call is worth disputing.Torre says adding those close calls \xe2\x80\x94 which the team is admitting the umpire got right \xe2\x80\x94 would bring the overturn rate down to 21 or 22%.The process hardly has been perfect, nor without its critics.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Padres\' Despaigne loses no-hitter in the 8thIt has to MLB altering the transfer rule \xe2\x80\x94 determining the difference between a fielder not making a catch or losing control of the ball after taking it out of his glove. Replays also have been in the middle of ongoing clarification of a new rule designed to eliminate home-plate collisions between catchers and baserunners.""I didn\'t like it in the beginning, and I don\'t like it now,"" says Todd Frazier, the Cincinnati Reds All-Star third baseman whose team has been successful on three of its 12 challenges. Only the St. Louis Cardinals\' 14% success rate is worse. By comparison, Miami Marlins manager Mike Redmond has been the most effective user of replay, getting 14 of 17 (82%) challenges overturned.""I know it\'s a learning experience,"" Frazier says. ""But if they\'re going to show it on the Jumbotron and you see a guy is blatantly out or blatantly safe and it doesn\'t get overturned, it\'s very frustrating.""Much of the frustration expressed has been about feedback \xe2\x80\x94 not knowing for sure the reasons for a ruling from the command center. Managers regularly communicate with the MLB offices, and players can get feedback after the fact even on specific plays, but that doesn\'t alleviate the immediate anger.***Covering all anglesTony Clark, executive director of the players\' union, fields players\' complaints just as Torre hears from managers. Clark has spent time in the Replay Operations Center, talking to umpires and watching the process.""What the ROC sees oftentimes is different than what\'s shown on the scoreboard,"" Clark says. ""One angle may look like the call should be this way, and that may be the angle that everyone sees on the scoreboard. But there may be an angle that (fans in the stadium) haven\'t seen.""All camera angles are immediately available to the ROC as well as each team\'s video coordinator sitting at a console in the clubhouse.It\'s up to the team\'s coordinator to quickly select the angles to help determine whether a review is prudent.That\'s one reason the rate of overturned calls has risen slightly through the season. Teams are becoming more adept at making those decisions and not wasting their two challenges a game.""Slowly but surely, the cooperation between baseball, the players and umpires has led to the rough edges being smoothed out,"" Clark says.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Werth\'s double in 9th helps Nats beat Brewers 5-4The umpiring crews who rotate through the video center in Manhattan, N.Y., have three options: overturning a call, confirming it as correct or ruling it stands, meaning the video evidence wasn\'t clear enough to merit changing the call. At that point, further on-field arguments result in automatic ejection.There have been more stands than confirmed (192 to 153), and the difficulty of those calls is indicated by the average 2:22 review time when stands is the ruling, compared with 1:22 for those confirmed and the 1:50 average overall.Torre says the pace of games, which was probably the most widely expressed concern when the system was announced, could be improved by streamlining the decision process for managers.""Some of the managers have abbreviated it by stepping out of the dugout just to indicate he may challenge while waiting for the bench coach to tell him,"" says Torre, who\'s against the NFL\'s red flags thrown by coaches.""In certain cities we\'d have a whole laundry bag coming on the field,"" he says.

Hardy said. ""And we\'re right there with them.""Maybe.

Oakland had 15 hits and chased starter Kevin Gausman (4-3) in the fifth before beating up Baltimore\'s bullpen the rest of the way.""We\'re all ready to get back into a routine for the rest of the season,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""It\'s a matter of sticking around and seeing if we can get a chance to roll the dice in September and October.""Gray (11-3) gave up two runs, one earned, two hits and two walks in 6 2-3 innings.

Jaso crossed the plate after a wild pitch by Gausman to give the A\'s a 2-0 lead.Oakland added another run on a weird blunder by Baltimore in the third, when center fielder Adam Jones \xe2\x80\x94 and several Orioles players \xe2\x80\x94 started trotting to the dugout after he caught Donaldson\'s fly for the second out. Cespedes jogged home from third, and Jones stopped and dropped his shoulders after realizing his mistake.Donaldson said he even questioned whether the scoreboard was correct when Jones began his trot to the dugout. Both managers said they were surprised, too.No matter.Jaso singled to drive in another run in the fourth that extended Oakland\'s lead to 4-0. The A\'s added three runs in the fifth, getting help on a throwing error by Machado \xe2\x80\x94 who continued to get booed for his bat-throwing incident against Oakland in Baltimore last month \xe2\x80\x94 at third base, and scored three more in the sixth.Eric O\'Flaherty tossed 1 1-3 scoreless innings, and Sean Doolittle pitched a perfect ninth as the A\'s closed out the Orioles.NOTES: Orioles RHP Ubaldo Jimenez, on the disabled list with a sprained right ankle, threw a bullpen session and will continue to work his way back before making a rehab start in the minors. ...

07/21/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: No Need to Panic', 'Jul 20, 2014; Oakland, CA, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Kevin Gausman (39) throws a pitch against the Oakland Athletics during the first inning at O.co Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Ed Szczepanski-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles dropped a Sunday game to the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s 10-2, losing the weekend series 2-1 and the season series 4-2. They also lost a game in the standings to everyone else in the AL East. Over the weekend, the AL East was 12-3, with the other four teams 11-1. The O\xe2\x80\x99s now head south to Los Angeles to play another team almost as good as the A\xe2\x80\x99s.Is it time to panic?No, not yet. The Orioles still maintain a three-game lead over the Jays and Yankees. But at the end of the day (and hopefully at the end of the regular season), this Orioles lineup is as good as any in the AL East. And even without pitching staff modifications, this staff can compete in this injury-riddled division. I know there are alternate opinions out there \xe2\x80\x93 beliefs that the O\xe2\x80\x99s and Dan Duquette need to make a dramatic move to compete and win. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two words for you if you think an acquisition or trade is sure to make a difference \xe2\x80\x93 Ubaldo Jimenez Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s an opinion, this is an opinion \xe2\x80\xa6 and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two words for you if you think an acquisition or trade is sure to make a difference \xe2\x80\x93 Ubaldo Jimenez.Regarding the weekend series with the A\xe2\x80\x99s:\xc2\xa0 This is a good team. I really can say I enjoyed watching these games and this Oakland team. They make the most of opportunities. And honestly, the Orioles should have come out of the weekend with a 2-1 record. And though the A\xe2\x80\x99s have twice blown out the Orioles this year, just a couple differences in the other two losses would have and should have made them Baltimore wins.The Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s are not categorically better than the Orioles. However, they sure looked like they are on Sunday. The yellow and green guys hit anything thrown over the heart of the plate\xe2\x80\x94tallying 15 hits to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 three and taking the game 10-2.I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to write about it in any detail, and you probably don\xe2\x80\x99t want to read any more about Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game. In summary, Kevin Gausman was not sharp, and he did not get away with any mistakes at all. His opponent Sonny Gray had excellent stuff\xe2\x80\x94as he has had in recent outings, hence having now an 11-3 record\xe2\x80\x94and there was little the Orioles could do to get to him. It was a great day for the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s, but again, it only counts as one win.There is little relief going down the coast to open a three-game set with the Angels. The Angels\xe2\x80\x99 34-16 record at home is the best in MLB. Los Angeles won two-of-three over the Mariners this past weekend, and they have won 12 of their last 14 games. You know the old saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just who you play, but when you play them?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Yep. The Yankees are 4-2 against the Angels, while the Jays are 4-3. Most of those games were played when the Angels were struggling to break above .500 earlier in the season. If it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for bad luck, the Orioles would have no luck at all.Bud Norris will make the start for the Orioles, as he continues to look to come back from his time on the DL. He is currently 7-6 with a 3.96 ERA.Of the big guns of the Angels against Norris: Albert Pujols is 7-for-36 with 3 doubles (.194), Mike Trout is 5-for-12 with 3 doubles, David Freese is 7-for-18 with 2 doubles, and Josh Hamilton is 4-for-12 with a double and homer.Also Chris Iannetta is 2-for-7, Erick Aybar is 2-for-9, and Howie Kendrick is 1-for-11.The Orioles will be facing yet another good rookie pitcher in Matt Shoemaker who is 7-2 with a 4.38 ERA.\xc2\xa0 Though he is a rookie, he is approaching age 28.

07/22/2014,"[('Get to know your Orioles: Chris Davis - Camden Chat', ' The 2014 season has been one of disappointment for the Orioles first baseman. He has struggled with inconsistency and injury. His average has dipped below .200 several times this season and fans have called for him to be moved even farther down the order. Through all of this, he is still one of the great power threats in all of baseball and not someone easy to bet against improving in the second half.

It is\xc2\xa0his humor. Whether it is\xc2\xa0goofing around during a preseason photo shoot, or\xc2\xa0high-fiving teammates that aren\'t there or his affinity for the man hug; like\xc2\xa0this and\xc2\xa0this.\xc2\xa0It is something that, his mother says, he has been doing his entire life. Chris is the son of Lyn and Karen and the little brother of Jennifer. When he was young, Chris would perform Will Ferrell skits from Saturday Night Live for his family. In high school he would regularly wear fuzzy, pink slippers to school, just because.    Davis comes from humble enough beginnings. His father works at a furniture store and his mother is an adjuster for Farmer\'s Insurance. The couple divorced when Chris was in high school.    It is also of note that the man they call ""Crush"" today was always destined to become the behemoth he is. He weighed in at 9 lbs as a newborn. And in middle school he would squeeze tennis balls to build his forearms. A funny story that his mother\xc2\xa0shared with ESPN last year was that when Chris was 11 years old he broke his ankle rollerblading. He had recovered just in time for Little League season. In the first game, without weeks to prepare like the other kids, he smacked a game-winning home run.    At Longview High School in Texas, Chris was both the starting shortstop and the ace of the Lobo\'s staff. He was bringing 94 mph cheddar on the mound and was maybe only a few pounds lighter then as he is now. He earned the nickname ""Biscuit"" from his varsity coach because he had told Davis that he was ""one biscuit away from outgrowing shortstop."" It wouldn\'t be his frame but his arm that actually moved him from the position as he suffered an injury his senior year. Despite the arm injury he still put up massive numbers, breaking Longview\'s school record by hitting 13 home runs in 30 games. It was enough for big league scouts to take notice. The New York Yankees selected him with the third to last selection of the 2004 draft. He would decline and attend the University of Texas on a baseball scholarship. However, things didn\'t go well at Texas. He was there during the fall of 2004. He worked out and practiced with the Longhorns, but he didn\'t see himself getting any playing time. Then, the decision was made to transfer to Navarro College, a community college two hours away from his high school.    At Navarro his reputation grew; the Angels selected him in the 35th round of the 2005 draft. He spurned the pros again in favor of his final year in junior college. Then, in 2006 he was named a pre-season JUCO All-American by Baseball America, hit 18 home runs for the Bulldogs and was chosen by his hometown Texas Rangers in the 5th round. After this, he tore through the minors in two seasons and made his debut at the age of 22. He played well, hitting .285 in 80 games and looked every bit like the next big thing in Texas. They like big things down there. But things were not meant to be. He struggled to keep his spot on the Rangers club. He would be shuttled between Texas and Triple-A for each of the next three seasons. His average in a major league uniform had taken a dip, his home runs were non-existent, and his strikeouts were astronomical. In 2010, Davis hit .192 in 45 games for Texas with one home run, 15 walks and 40 strikeouts. The Rangers were losing patience. It was at this time that Davis decided to take a look at his life. He was struggling professionally, but he believed that it had to do with things off the field. He didn\'t consider himself an alcoholic but he would drink, a lot. He recently told Baltimore Magazine that he had gotten into the routine of heading to the ballpark, playing the game, going straight to the bar afterwards and going to bed. It was the same thing every single day and he attacked it in the same manner he does many things in his life; full bore. He drank and drank hard.    Davis seeked the guidance of a well documented recovering addict and teammate, Josh Hamilton. The two are each very religious and would have long discussions on their lives. Hamilton helped the first baseman realize that baseball is not a guarantee, He needed to have his mind right if he were to reach his ultimate potential. As a result, Davis got out of the bar and stayed in the gym. He was also lucky enough to meet his future wife, Jill Meyer, at this time. They first met one another at a Tex-Mex restaurant in 2010. They began dating, and when Davis was assigned to the Domincan Republic for off-season training Jill came with him and stayed for an entire month. After a year of wooing, Davis proposed to Jill on the beach in Maui while the two enjoyed a candlelit dinner together. They were married in 2012 and just had their first child, Ella, in May. Jill was a support system for Chris is that final year in Texas. He had grown worried about his future in baseball.

He could reach 3 fWAR, which is no slouch when you consider the penalty imposed by his shoddy defense, time at DH, and home park. Over the next two months, we\xe2\x80\x99ll likely hear a lot about whether the Orioles will extend him\xc2\xa0and, if they do, what they should pay. Other teams will be on the hunt, given the league-wide decline in offense and his selection to the All Star Game, which proves that Cruz still resonates with fans despite his Biogenesis connection. One thing that\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that if the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t extend him, he\xe2\x80\x99s likely gone. Teams who don\'t extend free agents rarely end up re-signing the player. If he reaches the market, his primary competition will be Jonny Gomes, Corey Hart, Chris Denorfia, Rajai Davis, and Michael Morse. These players are all right-handed hitters in their mid-30s who primarily play a corner outfield spot or DH. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a quick summary of what these guys have done since 2011, in descending order of fWAR:    Name G PA AVG OBP SLG HR wOBA wRC+ BsR Off Def WAR   Chris Denorfia 467 1490 0.275 0.331 0.394 24 0.319 106 4 15.4 6.4 7.2   Nelson Cruz 488 2021 0.266 0.324 0.502 108 0.355 120 -9 36 -45.5 6.0   Corey Hart 327 1368 0.268 0.336 0.483 61 0.354 122 -3.8 31 -25.3 5.1   Jonny Gomes 404 1299 0.238 0.345 0.422 51 0.338 112 2.5 21.2 -19.4 4.6   Michael Morse 431 1694 0.276 0.325 0.483 76 0.349 123 -11.4 32.6 -59.6 2.8   Rajai Davis 421 1467 0.260 0.306 0.380 21 0.302 85 24.1 -1.3 -30.5 1.7      I was surprised to see that Chris Denorfia is the most valuable player in this group. He\xe2\x80\x99s a slightly above-average bat playing in pitcher-friendly San Diego, meaning his hitting line would see a boost in OPACY. He also plays much better defense than Cruz and is more of a threat on the bases. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any rumors of an extension, but his name is coming up in trade rumors because everyone thinks the Padres are entering fire sale mode.    Not that I expect Denorfia to provide much competition on the free agent market. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s name has much more cachet; he\xe2\x80\x99s played on two World Series teams, his name was splashed across the front pages this year due to the scandal and his contract status, and he\'s been an All-Star several times, including this year. Denorfia doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hit a lot of home runs and plays on the dreadful Padres. He probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get recognized on the street outside San Diego; oh, and he\'s hitting .239/.289/.322 right now.    Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s next-closest competitors are Corey Hart and Jonny Gomes. Both come with concerns. Hart was great in 2007 and good from 2010-2012, but he missed 2013 season when he had surgery on his left knee. He\xe2\x80\x99s on a make-good contract and he\xe2\x80\x99s not doing that well (-0.7 fWAR in Seattle). Gomes has been used in a platoon role because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hit righties well; he owns a career 91 wRC+ against them vs. a 137 wRC+ against lefties. So Cruz shouldn\'t worry about a team using Denorfia, Hart, or Gomes as a negotiation tactic to get him to lower his price. He has fewer red flags than either Hart or Gomes, and fairly or not, the name ""Nelson Cruz"" will make executives\xe2\x80\x99 and fans\xe2\x80\x99 hearts beat a little bit quicker than ""Chris Denorfia"". (Sorry Chris.)    The only real restriction on Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s contract is that NL teams probably won\xe2\x80\x99t bid for him. His defense in the outfield is bad and will only get worse over the course of any multi-year contract. That leaves only American League teams, and even then there are only a few that make sense for him. Keep in mind that Cruz will likely have a draft pick attached to him again.  The Mariners are one possible bidder. They have a poor offense and yet are in contention. If they hope to stay that way in 2015, they might make a run at Cruz. They reportedly offered him 5 years and $75 million in the offseason, but he turned them down. Now that they are contending this year, they\'d have a stronger case to sign him. The Royals are in a similar situation: dreams of contending despite a below-average offense. Their DH Billy Butler has declined each of the past few seasons and could be a free agent this offseason if the Royals don\xe2\x80\x99t exercise his option. Their right-fielder, Norchika Aoki, is also a free agent this offseason. The Rangers? It\xe2\x80\x99s possible. They have a rotating cast at DH and even have a need at first base. Their corner outfield spots are filled, though \xe2\x80\x94 Alex Rios has a 2015 team option which is why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t consider him above. Their 2014 is lost already but they may be counting on returning injured players to give them a push in 2015. The Twins are nowhere near contending, but Josh Willingham, their full-time left fielder, is a free agent after this season. He\xe2\x80\x99s two years older than Cruz and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t project to be a good player going forward. Their DH is Kendrys Morales, who is also a free agent after this year. The Indians could be a fringe player. They have a good offense and their corner outfield spots are filled, but they are contending and their DH (Ryan Raburn) is hitting terribly. And of course there\xe2\x80\x99s the Yankees, who seemingly never tire of mid-30s position players.  So that\'s the market for Nelson Cruz. He\xe2\x80\x99s not the best mid-30s right-handed corner OF/DH bat available, but he will command the most money in free agency. About four teams could sensibly bid for him, another two could if the stretched their logic. I know I said no NL teams would bid on him, but you should never count out the Phillies when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an aging slugger who can\xe2\x80\x99t run or field. What\xe2\x80\x99s he worth to the Orioles? This year and next, a good amount. The team\'s at the point on the marginal win curve where every win counts. All the key players, except for J.J. Hardy and possibly Nick Markakis, are on board through at least 2015. And Cruz isn\xe2\x80\x99t blocking any prospects in the minors.    A final consideration is that we\xe2\x80\x99re in an age of declining offense. League-wide wOBA has decreased from .316 in 2011 to .312 so far in 2014. OBP has dropped from .321 to 316 and SLG has dropped from .399 to .391 (even if it rose slightly in 2012). This environment makes OBP and power, of which Cruz provides more than nearly everyone else on the Orioles, scarcer and thus more expensive. I think he\'s worth at least a two-year extension. I would go as high as two years and $30 million. That\'s not much of an overpay -- the free agent market values a win at about $7 million, and it\'s not a stretch to think Cruz could be worth 2+ wins next year. He probably won\'t be that good in 2016, but again, the Orioles should go all-in while their window is open. That goes double when it means signing a mid-OBP, high-power guy in an era when pitching is ascendant. If Cruz wanted a third year, I might go as high as 3/36. That contract would seriously enter his decline phase, but if that\xe2\x80\x99s what it takes to get him for 2015, I\xe2\x80\x99m on board. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go beyond three years unless the AAV dropped to $8 million or so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Cruz will go that low, but maybe after his harsh offseason last year, he is looking for his ""forever home"". We all know it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time an aging slugger joined the Orioles for a farewell tour. The team has two negotiating tactics to get Cruz\'s offer down this low: make him a qualifying offer, which would make him less attractive to other teams, and make noise about signing Chris Denorfia, Corey Hart, and/or Michael Morse. But these are just my thoughts, Camden Chatters. How would you handle Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s situation? Would you let him walk? Just make him a qualifying offer? Or would you sign on for 2+ years of him? Tell us your thoughts in the comments.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
07/23/2014,"[('The Baltimore Orioles Fan Base is a Win-Sensitive One', 'Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAccording to a recent study, Baltimore Orioles fans are the second-most win sensitive fans in all of baseball. In other words, Baltimore has the second-worst tolerance for their team losing in the MLB. This can be seen on Orioles fan pages and chat rooms after a game.If the Orioles win a game, everyone is fairly happy with the exception of a few \xe2\x80\x9cnit-pickers\xe2\x80\x9d out there. Yet, if the Orioles drop one game, fans come out in large numbers saying how Showalter does not know how to manage a ball club, they should trade for an ace, and how mediocre the team is (even though the Orioles are in first place by four games).I will be honest here. I, myself, contribute to this study that called\xc2\xa0the Orioles fan base a win-sensitive one. When Miguel Gonzalez struggled early on this season, I remember loathing him and wishing the Orioles would send him down to the Minors or just trade him away. And after his past three outings, Gonzalez has become my favorite pitcher in the Orioles rotation.Although I believe this study adequately describes Orioles fans as a whole, I have to ask the people who were in charge of collecting the data, \xe2\x80\x9cCan you blame us?\xe2\x80\x9dUntil the Buckle Up Birds in 2012, Orioles fans were forced\xc2\xa0to watch 14 consecutive years of losing baseball. They (rather, we) had to suffer through watching players like Larry Bigbie, Brook Fordyce, and\xc2\xa0Luis Matos struggle at the plate and pitchers like Buddy Groom, Mike DeJean and Jorge Julio lose countless games for the Orioles coming out of the bullpen. All of these players were being managed by the likes of Mike Hargrove, Lee Mazzilli, and Dave Trembley\xc2\xa0who all made fans pull their hair out.In those years of losing, it seemed like a pattern arose after awhile. The season would start off with manager and players both saying they have a good ball club and fans should look out for them. This always got the fans\xe2\x80\x99 hopes up as did the beginning of the season when the Orioles would start off great and everyone thought the same thing: \xe2\x80\x9cHey maybe this will be our year.\xe2\x80\x9dUnfortunately, this just led to heartbreak year after year when the team could not sustain their winning habits and slip far away from playoff contention and out of relevance in the MLB.Then in November of 2011, a new Executive-Vice President for Players Operations came into town by the name of Dan Duquette. He said he wanted to bring a championship team back to Baltimore and at that point all of Baltimore probably rolled their eyes acknowledging that it was the same story, different day.Yet, this time, Baltimore was not let down but rather they were picked up by the team in 2012 and carried into the Postseason for the first time since 1997. And after back-to-back winning seasons in the books, it is safe to say Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette have gotten Baltimore excited about baseball again.This third season with the Duquette and Showalter duo is proving to be their best one yet. The Orioles are currently 55-44 sitting atop the American League East with a four game lead on the Yankees and Blue Jays. Even with the struggling Chris Davis and Matt Wieters having to sit out the rest of the year after having Tommy John Surgery, the Orioles continue to defy the odds and win baseball games.Why are there \xe2\x80\x9cbipolar\xe2\x80\x9d fans still in Baltimore if the team is so good you ask? I think it is because, since this city has not seen winning baseball in so long, now that they have it they do not believe it, including myself.There is a part of me and a part of all Orioles fans that worry this team will slip back into their losing ways after blowing a save or losing a couple of games in a row. This winning thing seems too good to be true. It may be something that can be fixed with an American League East Division Title.Until that comes into fruition\xe2\x80\xa6 Stay Hungry Baltimore!

When you lose the third game (even after winning the first two) like the Baltimore Orioles did last night in Anaheim it comes across almost like dropping the series.Obviously we all know that\xe2\x80\x99s not true, however I\xe2\x80\x9dm just saying that after you gather your belongings, get on the bus, get to the airport, and start flying to the next city, you\xe2\x80\x99re kind of leaving that town with a bad taste in your mouth.

Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s issue was once again going deep into counts, although he was able to get strike one fairly consistently. The two walks and three strikeouts are good signs, as that means he\xe2\x80\x99s pitching to contact and getting people out in doing so.Anaheim got on the board first after Mike Trout hit an infield single to third base, followed an Albert Pujols RBI-single. And that shows you how quick Trout is, as he scored from first base. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest; when Trout first came into the league I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like him too much because I though he was a bit of a show boater. But I also feel like he\xe2\x80\x99s calmed down a bit, and there\xe2\x80\x99s never been any question about the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s a great player (the same caliber of Manny Machado and Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Bryce Harper) and that he\xc2\xa0always plays hard.Anaheim would threaten again with two outs in the second and runners on first and second base. However catcher Chris Iannetta (who was on second) was caught napping. J.J. Hardy very slowly and very quietly got behind Iannetta and when Tillman threw the ball to Hardy the runner was out by a mile. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even close; the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to wait for the umpire to call the runner out, they just started running towards the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 dugout.Ryan Flaherty, who was once again playing third base in place of Machado, smacked a one-out double in the third inning. He advanced to third on Nick Hundley\xe2\x80\x98s fly out, and he would later score on Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-single to tie the game.

David Lough, who garnered a rare start last night, got aboard with a one-out single. Lough, who\xe2\x80\x99s fast as lightning, proceeded to steal second base. Lough would score on Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 subsequent RBI-single, and suddenly the Orioles had a 2-1 lead.It\xe2\x80\x99s little things like that which can win you games. Lough is normally a late-inning defensive replacement, however he possibly earned some extra playing time here and there with that steal last night. Whether or not he cracks the starting lineup more often remains to be seen, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me to see him inserted more often as a pinch runner when the O\xe2\x80\x99s need a boost here and there.Unfortunately, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 night however. Tommy Hunter came on in the seventh, and in the eighth he allowed a lead off single to Josh Hamilton, followed by an RBI-double to Alex Aybar which tied the game at two. Later in the inning (with Brian Matusz pitching) the O\xe2\x80\x99s intentionally walked Navarro to load the bases, however Matusz ended up issuing another walk to Calhoun which gave Anaheim the lead back and the game at 3-2.People can second guess the decision to load the bases all day long. The fact is that strategy like that has won Buck Showalter more games than it\xe2\x80\x99s lost him. The two wins thus far that the Orioles have against Washington came about because Showalter ordered Bryce Harper intentionally walked with first base open. If it induces a righty/righty or lefty/lefty matchup, fans should have no issue with it because you have better odds in those circumstances. In this case Brian Matusz walked in the go-ahead run, but I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a chance you have to take.So the Birds got out of Anaheim with two-of-three, which is certainly to their advantage. Keep in mind that Anaheim had been playing very well at home this season; even given the loss last night, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are playing good baseball at a clutch moment in the season.

The Orioles hitters didn\xe2\x80\x99t do nearly as much, but they got some knocks when it counted. Down 1-0 in the top of the third with one out, Ryan Flaherty knocked a ground rule double. He tagged and advanced to third on a Nick Hundley flyout, then scored when Nick Markakis poked a single past a diving Howie Kendrick.  In the top of the sixth, the Orioles took the lead. Nick Hundley fouled out and Nick Markakis grounded out, but David Lough singled for his first hit of the night. Jered Weaver, threw over to first several times, trying to keep Lough close, but threw a curveball at the wrong time and Lough motored into second base easily. It proved to be a great steal, as the next batter Adam Jones juuuuuust barely dunked a single into right field. With two outs, Lough was running on contact and scored to make it 2-1 Orioles.   Tillman finished his six innings of work and turned it over to the bullpen in the seventh. Tommy Hunter came in and got Kole Calhoun to fly out. He walked Trout, who took off for second on a hit-and-run, but Pujols grounded the ball right back to the mound. Hunter gloved it and fired to second to nail Trout and start the double play.  No such luck in the eighth, though. Josh Hamilton started with a bloop fly ball to shallow right field. It was within reach of Schoop, who was playing in the shift, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a good read on it and started off in the wrong direction. By the time he realized where the ball was going, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get there and it fell for a single. The play proved costly when Erick Aybar smacked a line-drive double; Hamilton was running all the way and scored easily to tie the game at 2. Hunter then struck out Howie Kendrick and David Freese on some nasty curveballs, although Aybar stole third while Freese was at the plate.  With two down and the go-ahead run on third, Buck Showalter elected to walk left-handed hitter Efran Navarro. Although he owns a .346 career wOBA and bats left-handed, Navarro has 82 PA in the big leagues and so I question Buck\xe2\x80\x99s decision to issue the pass here. At any rate, it backfired when Hunter walked the right-handed Chris Ianetta, the Angels\xe2\x80\x99 #9 hitter. That loaded the bases for lefty Kole Calhoun. Whom do you bring in when you need a left-handed hitter retired? Brian Matusz, that\xe2\x80\x99s who. But Matusz couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the zone tonight. He walked Calhoun to bring in the go-ahead run and make it 3-2 Angels. Then all of a sudden the best player in baseball was standing at the plate with the bases loaded in a one-run game. But Ryan Webb got Mike Trout to fly out harmlessly to left field.  It was a brand-new ballgame, only this time the Orioles were on the short end of it. They went down quietly against new Angels closer Huston Street, with only Chris Davis managing to get on base via a walk. What else ended the game but a swinging strikeout by Jonathan Schoop.  Although they did win the series, the loss drops the Orioles to 55-45 and reduces their lead over the Yankees and Blue Jays to three games. The Angels move to 60-40, 1.5 games behind Oakland, although as I write this the A\xe2\x80\x99s are up 9-5 on the Astros in the 8th.  The Orioles fly to Seattle tomorrow where Wei-Yin Chen will face Hisashi Iwakuma.      "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
07/25/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles Among Teams Interested In Catcher Kurt ...', 'According to Jon Heyman of CBS Sports, The Baltimore Orioles and the St. Louis Cardinals are among several teams that are interested in Minnesota Twins all-star catcher Kurt Suzuki.orioles and cardinals are among teams looking at catcher kurt suzuki. story up on @CBSSports\xe2\x80\x94 Jon Heyman (@JonHeymanCBS) July 25, 2014After losing all-star catcher Matt Wieters for the season to an elbow injury which required Tommy John surgery, the Orioles were looking for a replacement at catcher. The team recently acquired Nick Hundley from the San Diego Padres. The seven-year veteran has hit two home runs and ten RBIs in 24 games with the O\xe2\x80\x99s while owning a .213 batting average.The Orioles have also used catchers such as Steve Clevenger and Caleb Joseph. Although they have shown some spurts, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t really been productive at all. Joseph has hit to a .195 batting average with three home runs and 12 RBIs while Clevenger posted\xc2\xa0a more respectable average of .240, but has hit zero home runs. And his defense was suspect. As you can see, it has been quite a problem.It was a really unfortunate time for Wieters to suffer his injury as he was off to a career-year start. He played 26 games this season while hitting to an average of .308 with five home runs and 18 RBIs. He has never hit for an average of over .262 in any year that he has played at least 100 games in his career. Acquiring Suzuki would be a huge boost for the Orioles, as he is hitting .308 on the year and was selected to the 2014 all-star game.With that being said, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that this move is required. Sure it would be nice to upgrade at a position that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen much production so far this season, but there is no reason to force a trade that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to occur in order for the team to make a deep run in the postseason. If the right offer is put forth, then go ahead; but don\xe2\x80\x99t give up any valuable assets. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Hall of Fame weekend: Are there any present day Orioles ...', ' Baseball\'s Hall of Fame induction ceremonies are coming up this weekend and, unlike last year, there will be three of the game\'s all-time great players being enshrined in Cooperstown. Orioles fans haven\'t had much reason to get excited about Hall of Fame weekend since Cal Ripken Jr. was inducted in 2007, and until the baseball writers get their heads out of their behinds and appreciate the greatness of Mike Mussina, that will continue to be the case. After Mussina makes it in, or not, it\'s a bleak picture for O\'s fans wanting to see one of our own make it into Cooperstown. A lost decade will do that to a team. The greatest Oriole of the 00s was, what, Brian Roberts? He played on terrible teams, made two All-Star teams, received MVP votes exactly one time, never won a Gold Glove, and currently has 1,526 hits, just over halfway to that magical 3,000 hit mark in his age 36 season. Maybe if he\'d kept performing at the level he did in 2009 (.283/.356/.451 with 56 doubles) every year beyond that, he might have a chance. That\'s generally not how aging baseball players work, barring some kind of possible chemical enhancement that helps you sustain performance and destroy dugout phones. And anyway, Roberts, whose name showed up in the Mitchell Report, would have all of that PED baggage with voters who won\'t even elect Jeff Bagwell, even if Roberts had the career numbers. He was a great Oriole on some bad Orioles teams, but Cooperstown? Not even close.    One year ago, I posed the question of whether there was a future Hall of Fame player currently on the Orioles. About 82% of readers answered yes in the poll, which is still crazy. As Hall of Fame weekend rolls around again, it\'s time to revisit the landscape and see what it would take for our current Orioles icons to build Hall of Fame cases for themselves.    This post is mostly about whether O\'s players have a chance of reaching certain ""automatic"" benchmarks like 3,000 hits or 500 home runs or 300 wins. It\'s possible that more lenient standards will evolve as the electorate changes and recognizes that things have changed, particularly in the PED testing era. Walks may start to matter more, for instance - not that this would help a member of the Orioles anyway. Nick MarkakisAge: 30MLB seasons: 9 Once, Markakis had the calling card of hitting lots of doubles. When it comes to doubles, 600 is something of a benchmark in the sense that every player who has ever hit 600+ doubles is either in the Hall of Fame or happens to be Pete Rose or Barry Bonds. Only 14 players have ever recorded 600+ doubles in the history of baseball.    Markakis opened up his first full MLB season at age 23 by racking up 43 doubles and 23 home runs. That\'s pretty good, and yet he would have still had to fire off another 14 seasons just like that to get to 600 doubles. That\'s no easy task. Two years later, the home runs tapered off, and two years farther, even the doubles started to fade. He currently has 309 career doubles, with 20 so far this year. If he hits another 10 in 2014, he\'ll need 28 doubles a year for the next decade to get to 600. It\'s not happening. Adam JonesAge: 28 (turning 29 on August 1)MLB seasons: 9    If you think of the face of this Orioles team, you\'re probably thinking about Adam Jones. He deserves the recognition, a charismatic player who\'s embraced Baltimore and has a level of great performance on the field to back up when he decides to pop off to reporters by saying things like, ""Why don\'t you ask Tanaka what it\'ll be like to face me?"" As far as his chances of hitting a magic Hall of Fame number, he\'s probably looking at 500 home runs as his ticket in. He\'ll be 29 in a matter of days and he has 159 home runs to date in his career. That is a long climb. If he equals adds another 10 home runs this year - 19 so far in 101 games - he\'d only need to hit 33 home runs a season for the next decade to get himself to 500. That would put him at age 39 at the end of his journey. Not likely. One thing working in Jones\' favor, though, is that he\'s actually developed power as a hitter as his career has gone on. He probably doesn\'t have any 50 homer seasons in him to shave time off the back end. Father Time will come for him eventually. Still, what if the Orioles continue to be a good team for the next five years, Jones continues to be the best player on those good teams, and they eventually win a World Series? That would be something. Jones has it in him to get some of the postseason heroics that voters love, if the rest of the team can keep getting him there. Four All-Star teams, three Gold Gloves, at least one top-10 MVP season and possibly more coming. Voters love that stuff too. A long shot, but not a no-shot. Manny MachadoAge: 22MLB seasons: 3 Winning the first ever Platinum Glove for best fielder in the American League in his age 20 season certainly doesn\'t hurt for Machado, because double-digit Gold Gloves is just the sort of thing that gets you Hall of Fame steam. Does Machado have that in him? He might not add another this year since he missed a lot of time, but once he got back up to game speed, he looks to have the same brilliance in the field, just mind-blowing transcendental defensive talent.    He stands something of a chance as a hitter too, if his bat grows the way that we hope. Machado, at his young age, has already gotten himself 308 hits in his career. He is getting about a hit per game played this year; if he adds another 60 by year\'s end, that would leave him needing 2,632 hits to get 3,000, a fortuitous number for Orioles fans. If Machado chips away at that number over 15 years, leaving him ""only"" 37 at the end of it, that would be about 174 hits per year through 2029. No big deal, right? Machado\'s still young enough that we can dream about how his bat will develop, but as Markakis shows us, sometimes that never really happens. Machado hit 51 doubles last year, for instance, about one for every three games played, but he only has 10 through 66 games this year. If he gets better and stays better for a long time, and stays healthy, he could be a player with a strong case for multiple facets of his game. Then, we\'d still have to hope he spent all of that time on the Orioles to get elected as an Oriole. Also a long shot, if only because so much can go wrong over 15 years. Chris DavisAge: 28MLB seasons: 7 This was worth talking about briefly last year as Davis went on to hit 53 home runs. He\'s now batting .203/.312/.392, a full 300 points of OPS below where he was last year. Davis has 146 career home runs. He\'s even behind Jones, though he\'s a year younger. Davis has hit about one home run for every five games played - let\'s say he\'s good for another 12 this year, putting him at 158 career homers. He\'d only need 34 home runs a year for the next decade from that point. It\'s hard to even imagine him playing for another decade.    Chris TillmanAge: 26MLB seasons: 6 300 wins? Tillman had 32 career wins heading into this season. At this time last year, he was on a pace to win 20 games on the season, making it briefly worth considering, well, what if he kept up that pace. This year, he\'s on pace to win 10. Thanks for playing, Chris. He has one 200-inning season under his belt and is not on pace to get another one this year. Perhaps in a year\'s time, Kevin Gausman will be wowing us enough to shift our wild pitcher extrapolation dreams to him. ** Let\'s get crazy and say that Jones plays out his career with the Orioles, has a few years where he\'s solidly in the second tier behind Mike Trout, wins a World Series, and crawls over the 500 home run plateau when he is 39 years old, then retires. The year is now 2024, meaning that, if Jones somehow got in on the first ballot, he would be inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2030. I will turn 47 later that year. All things are possible in this crazy new world of Orioles baseball, make no mistake. But when it comes to one of these guys getting into the Hall of Fame, it would be a good idea not to hold your breath.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The up-and-coming first baseman has made use of every chance he has gotten this year and his 29 plate appearances with the Norfolk Tides has been no exception.Since coming up to Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Triple-A affiliate, Walker has batted .345 with six runs batted in. Despite not recording a home run yet with the Tides, his batting average and on-base percentage (.475) are signs that this young player is ready to play at the Major League level.Another Tides player to make note of is Jimmy Parades. The Orioles signed him to a Minor League deal earlier in the week. In his first game with the Tides on Friday, Parades went 2-4 with a double and a two-run single which helped give the Tides a 5-2 victory over the Columbus Clippers.Parades is a career .233 hitter in the Majors and is primarily a utility player. \xc2\xa0If he were to get a call up to the Orioles, he would more than likely be a player to come off the bench much like David Lough and Delmon Young have been to the team so far this season.Also, Mike Wright recorded his second win of the 2014 season. In a year where good things are hard to come by for Wright with a 2-9 record and 6.16 ERA, last night\xe2\x80\x99s performance was one of them.

Yaz improved his batting average in Bowie to .342 and his on-base percentage to .390. The question is, if he continues to hit the way he has been and playing great defense, could Yastrzemski see another promotion this season from Double-A to Triple-A.If so Yastrzemski would have started 2014 in Single-A Delmarva and ended it in Triple-A Norfolk.

But visiting the home parks of each of the three Baltimore-based members of the Cal Ripken League should have been easier than it was. The Baltimore Redbirds offered a fun experience, while the Baltimore Dodgers need some work to engage the fans. And all of the Baltimore teams pale in comparison to the fan experience offered by the DC area-based teams of that same league, especially the Bethesda Big Train, who I also visited recently.So I finally saw a game for Youse\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles as they played the Silver Spring-Takoma ThunderBolts. This team plays out of the Bachman Sports Complex Park in Glen Burnie. That complex has a variety of softball fields to go along with the single baseball field. There are not many seats at this field, but it is clear that it is a well-maintained facility; but it really could use a scoreboard. Fans are often friends or family of the players, with some locals stopping by on the way to softball games. They are knowledgeable. Games are free and a concession stand can be found over by the softball fields.The Youse\xe2\x80\x99s Maryland Orioles is a longstanding team and organization. Started in 1952, it gets its name from\xc2\xa0Walter Youse, who managed the team from 1957 until his death 9 years ago.

Reggie Jackson, Al Kaline and Steve Clevenger\xc2\xa0are just a few of the players to have played for this team before making the major leagues.\xc2\xa0Clevenger has, of course, has been sent down to Norfolk as the Baltimore Orioles have a bit of a jam at catcher currently.The team recently pulled out of the 2014 AAABA championship as their roster has been depleted by professional signings and the lack of enough in-state players. The\xc2\xa0AAABA rules state that at least 50% of your roster must be local.

Based upon that (putting the Ray Rice suspension into account), we can project which players on the \xe2\x80\x9cbubble\xe2\x80\x9d will slightly make the roster and which of the players will just miss it.First Four OutDeonte Thompson, WRSep 29, 2013; Orchard Park, NY, USA; Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Deonte Thompson (83) runs against the Buffalo Bills during the first half at Ralph Wilson Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kevin Hoffman-USA TODAY SportsAlthough Thompson hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the most productive player with the Ravens, he is a very familiar name to Ravens fans. He has been on the team for three years and has seen playing time in each season. However, he never blossomed into the receiver or the kick return man that they envisioned him to be. In my opinion, this will lead to his departure and he will not be included in the 53-man roster. Also note that the Ravens drafted wide receiver Micheal Campanaro and picked up undrafted free agent Jeremy Butler.Phillip Supernaw, TESupernaw won\xe2\x80\x99t miss the roster due to a lack of displayed talent on the practice field. In fact, he impressed the Ravens very much this past offseason. Rather, he will miss the roster due to the fact that there just simply isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough room. The Ravens recently acquired Owen Daniels who will immediately be inserted into the second slot. The team also drafted Crockett Gilmore in the third round of the 2014 draft, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t draft a player in the third round only to kick him off the team three months later. You can not have four tight ends on a roster which means that although Supernaw has impressed the Ravens throughout, he will likely not be a part of the 2014 Ravens.A.Q. Shipley, CShipley played dreadfully last year when he got the chance, perhaps even worse than Gino Gradkowski. Although both Centers performed very unimpressively last season, I think that Shipley will be the one that misses the cut.Jeromy Miles, FSAfter going undrafted in the 2010 draft, Miles signed with the Cincinnati Bengals. He was released in September of 2013 and was claimed off waivers\xc2\xa0by the Ravens just a couple of days later. He actually did participate with the team last year, but mostly on special teams. He ended the season with ten tackles. After signing a one-year deal with the Ravens, he has made the case to perhaps make the roster once again. However, I think that Anthony Levine, who has a very similar role to Miles, will grab his spot instead and Miles will find a home on the practice squad unless needed on the active roster.Next1 of 3Prev postUse your \xe2\x86\x90 \xe2\x86\x92 (arrows) to browse  var tpsInstance;var tpsOptions = {""slideContainer"":""#tps_slideContainer_6188"",""nav"":["".theiaPostSlider_nav""],""navText"":""%{currentSlide} of %{totalSlides}"",""helperText"":""Use your \\u2190 \\u2192 (arrows) to browse"",""defaultSlide"":0,""transitionEffect"":""simple"",""transitionSpeed"":200,""keyboardShortcuts"":true,""numberOfSlides"":3,""slides"":[{""title"":""Baltimore Ravens Roster: First 4 Players Out, Last 4 Players In"",""permalink"":""http:\\/\\/thebaltimorewire.com\\/2014\\/07\\/27\\/baltimore-ravens-roster-first-4-players-last-4-players\\/"",""shortCodeTitle"":null,""content"":""<p>When training camp and preseason comes around, there&#8217;s a concept called the &#8220;bubble&#8221;.

In my opinion, this will lead to his departure and he will not be included in the 53-man roster.

07/28/2014,"[('Angels-Orioles Preview - Yahoo', 'The Los Angeles Angels and Baltimore Orioles have boasted two of baseball\'s better offenses this season, but they\'ve relied on excellent pitching more of late.Los Angeles is hoping Mike Trout\'s road dominance can be the difference in what could be a low-scoring matchup Tuesday night at Camden Yards.The Angels (63-41) come off three straight home victories over Detroit after dropping Thursday\'s series opener. Their pitchers yielded two runs and 13 hits in those wins, and the bullpen continued its dominant run.Their relievers own a major league-best 1.78 ERA over the last 21 games after ranking 25th with a 4.13 mark for the season. Closer Huston Street hasn\'t allowed a run in four appearances and converted all three of his save opportunities since being acquired from San Diego.""If you can go five and keep us in the game, it\'s almost a guarantee they\'re going to come in and put up a zero,"" starter Hector Santiago said after limiting Detroit to one run in 5 1-3 innings of Sunday\'s 2-1 victory. ""We used to be scared if we left guys on base. Now it\'s like we just sit back and watch the rest of the game.""Los Angeles, which ranks second in the majors with 4.9 runs per game, averaged just 3.0 runs during its 6-4 homestand, but has won six of seven on the road while averaging 7.1 runs and hitting .312.Trout was 4 for 26 over the last seven games but he\'s batting .430 with nine homers, eight doubles and 26 RBIs over his last 20 road contests. He leads the majors with a 1.040 OPS on the road and has seven homers in his last 13 games versus Baltimore.The Orioles (58-46) went 6-4 on their 10-game road swing and took two of three in Anaheim last week to improve to 6-2 in their last eight against the Angels. Baltimore starters posted a 1.77 ERA over 20 1-3 innings versus the Angels and a 2.92 mark on the road trip, picking up an offense that has scored more than four runs just once in the last 15 games.Chris Tillman (7-5, 3.92 ERA) gave up one run in six innings without a decision in last Wednesday\'s 3-2 loss at Los Angeles.""They\'ve got a good lineup,"" Tillman told MLB\'s official website. ""They are going to battle all night long ...It never felt like you had the game in hand. They grinded me out tonight, put some real good at-bats together.""Tillman is winless in five straight starts despite a 3.09 ERA, touting a 2.53 run-support average in that span. He won his previous two career starts versus the Angels, though, and has limited them to four runs over 20 2-3 innings in three matchups.Jered Weaver (11-6, 3.36) gets the nod for the Angels, having gone 4-0 with a 2.68 ERA in his last seven starts. He improved to 5-2 with a 2.28 ERA in his last seven matchups with Baltimore last Wednesday opposite Tillman, limiting the Orioles to two runs over eight innings.""My fastball command has been pretty good the last couple of games, and I feel like I\'m getting stronger every time out,"" Weaver said. ""So I just want to keep working on it and keep establishing it because it sets up everything else.""Nelson Cruz is second in the majors with 29 homers but is just 15 for 69 (.217) versus Weaver, and his 22 strikeouts are the most of any player against the right-hander.

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles completed a successful West Coast road trip of 10 games in 10 days with a 3-2, 10th-inning victory over the Seattle Mariners. All in all, O\xe2\x80\x99s fans have to be pleased with a 6-4 record over those games against some of the best pitching in MLB.The strength of opponent pitching is evident in the fact that the Orioles only batted .201 over the 10 games. Winning six contests in light of that is pretty amazing\xe2\x80\x94attributable to the 3.17 ERA of the pitching staff.The Orioles came out of the All-Star break with a four-game lead in the AL East over both the Jays and Yankees. The Jays have picked up one game, while NY remains four games behind. The Rays have won nine of the last 10 to get now to 7.5 games behind the Birds. The Red Sox appear to be falling off the edge of the earth \xe2\x80\xa6 oops, there they go \xe2\x80\xa6 gone! Have a happy fall \xe2\x80\x93 without baseball this year.On this Sunday afternoon, the Orioles managed to come away with a win in a game they did not necessarily deserve to win \xe2\x80\xa6 not that they deserved to lose, but it was one that could have just as easily gone the other way. The Orioles squandered a number of opportunities to add runs and build some margin. And as always, good defense was an additional asset for the Birds.Manny Machado was the probable MVP of this game \xe2\x80\x93 getting two hits and two RBIs, including a final sac fly game winner on an 0-2 pitch in the top of the 10th inning.Miguel Gonzalez did his typical contribution of hanging around and holding the Orioles in the game long enough to eventually have a shot at winning. Over six innings he allowed eight hits and two walks, all of which is enough to get a pitcher into more trouble than giving up only a single run. And that is all he allowed. He competes. Gotta love him for that.The Orioles return home for six games \xe2\x80\x93 three each against the Angels and Mariners. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking more about matchups in posts this coming week, but one quick note is to say that the Orioles will not have to face Felix Hernandez. He will be pitching on Wednesday. They will likely have to face Hisashi Iwakuma next Sunday.After the six games at home, the Baltimore Orioles will hit the road for a single game in Washington, followed by three in Toronto. After that is five home games against the Cardinals and Yankees. So, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will be playing 25 consecutive games after the break against teams with winning records, before finally seeing the Indians\xe2\x80\x94who are at this moment only one game under .500.Hopefully the Orioles players remember how to get to Camden Yards. The last game there was on July 13th, so it will be 16 days between games in Baltimore. What a schedule this has been this year.The Orioles have again now played more games on the road versus at home\xe2\x80\x9455 to 49. The Orioles are three games over .500 at home, but have an excellent 32-23 road record. Only the Detroit Tigers have been better on the road. If the Orioles could sweep this six-game home series, they could match their road record \xe2\x80\xa6 now there\xe2\x80\x99s something to shoot for!The 58 wins by the Orioles is exceeded in MLB only by the A\xe2\x80\x99s, Angels, Brewers, and Dodgers.The Birds are also 35-12 in extra innings wins over the past three seasons. That is a statistic about which to be particularly pleased.There are no especially good trade rumors out there to comment upon. The most common name mentioned a bit with the Orioles is catcher Kurt Suzuki. It would be great to have his bat in the lineup, but there is the issue of gaining comfort with the pitching staff. So this sort of falls into the category of \xe2\x80\x9cif it ain\xe2\x80\x99t broke\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9dApparently Dan Duquette is disinclined to part with young pitching talent, and I think most O\xe2\x80\x99s fans would applaud that position. The entire Ubaldo Jimenez situation may have quelled the fanbase\xe2\x80\x99s regular criticism of wanting to make bold moves, but being disappointed in what is accomplished. The best overall situation for the Baltimore Orioles at this point may be to go to war with the army they currently have.

Mandatory Credit: Ed Szczepanski-USA TODAY SportsOn Friday, Kevin Gausman started for the Baltimore Orioles. He continued what has been a largely splendid season, as he limited the Seattle Mariners to one earned run over 6.2 innings.\xc2\xa0While another obligation prevented me from watching, I did take a gander at Twitter, to see this humorous observation:Gausman is 4-0 in wins and 0-3 in losses? No way.. pic.twitter.com/u5kL8491Du \xe2\x80\x94 connor (@connorgucci69) July 26, 2014The pointlessness of a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s win-loss record notwithstanding, this inconsistency struck me as odd. I decided to look into it, to see if Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0peripherals were this fickle.As it turns out, they are. Gausman has started nine games this year, with an overall SIERA of 4.44; if he had enough innings, that would rank 84th out of 93 qualifiers. In other words, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t pitched that well overall. However, on a start-by-start basis, I saw something interesting: He has never come close to that figure in any one outing.In four of Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s starts\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 June 18th against the Tampa Bay Rays, July 20th and June 7th against the Oakland Athletics, and July 6th against the Boston Red Sox\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 his SIERA was at or below 3.40. That mark would rank 26th in the majors, and would be better than the likes of Adam Wainwright and Julio Teheran. By contrast, in the other five starts\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 July 13th against the New York Yankees, July 25th (Friday) against the Mariners, June 12th against the Toronto Blue Jays, May 14th against the Detroit Tigers, and\xc2\xa0June 27th against the Rays\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s SIERA was at or above 4.97. That mark would rank 91st in the majors, and would be worse than the likes of Travis Wood and Eric Stults.What has driven these dichotomous results? Primarily, strikeouts. In the four good games, Gausman fanned at least 21.7% of the batters he faced; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t top 11.1% in any of the other five.\xc2\xa0His K%s and SIERAs have an R^2\xc2\xa0of .916, indicating a very strong correlation. While his walk, ground ball, and fly ball rates correlate decently to his SIERA (with\xc2\xa0R^2s of .308, .279, and .259, respectively), we should attribute most of his SIERA variability to punchouts.Let\xe2\x80\x99s shift our focus to those, then. We can take them seriously, as Mike Podhorzer\xe2\x80\x99s xK% equation proves their legitimacy. Indeed, the relationship\xc2\xa0between his xK%s and his SIERAs is actually stronger, with a correlation coefficient of .924. Furthermore, correlating the individual components to his strikeout rates, we see that S/Str% (the percentage of strikes that are swinging) accounts for most of the K% variability, as its\xc2\xa0R^2\xc2\xa0sits at .454.So, to summarize all of that: Gausman has had four superb games, and five terrible games. He derived most of his success from strikeouts, and he derived most of his strikeouts from whiffs. To determine the cause of the latter, we\xe2\x80\x99ll delve into PITCHf/x data.For the year as a whole, Gausman has accrued most of his whiffs on two pitches: the splitter, and the four-seamer, which account for 36 and 33, respectively, of his 81 total swings-and-misses. The former excels via its quality (it has a 24.5% swinging-strike rate against); the latter, via its quantity (he throws it 69.2% of the time). Location-wise, he generally has the most success with the splitter when he paints the lower left portion of he plate with it\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6while his four-seamer does well when it goes to the upper middle part of the plate:If we break this down on a start-by-start basis, a pattern emerges. In the five bad starts, he did one of a few things wrong: He didn\xe2\x80\x99t utilize the splitter enough; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t locate it properly when he did; or, if he did the former two, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t locate the four-seamer properly.Let\xe2\x80\x99s go through on a start-by-start basis \xe2\x80\x94 starting with the poor ones:In the Detroit start, he threw only seven splitters (8.1% of his total pitches), and all to the lower right of the plate.He made a similar error in the New York game, as he used it a mere five times (6.4%), and put it in the middle-to-upper left of the plate when he did.Pitching in Toronto, he implemented it 10 times (9.9%), but only four of those were in the bottom left.His second outing in Tampa actually saw him use it even more, at 21.1%; plus, most of those were in the lower left. However, he placed the four-seam fastball in the middle left, for whatever reason.The Seattle game was even worse: While he fulfilled the first two conditions handily, he threw the four-seamer seemingly everywhere but up.Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the splendid ones:In his first bout in Tampa, he pounded the lower left with the splitter, and did so often (26.1% of his pitches).His second Oakland game was virtually analogous, with a 23.9% splitter rate to accompany a heavy focus on the lower left.The first time around the bay had him using it less (15.9%), but eschewing the top and middle, as well as the right and center.While in Boston, he threw it less too (14.4%) and drifted toward the middle left when he did; nevertheless, a top-heavy approach with the four-seamer bailed him out.So the method to Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s madness thus far? Throw the splitter to the lower left, and good things happen; don\xe2\x80\x99t, and bad things happen. It might sound overly simple, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the way it is. If he can just realize this, he could tap into Dr. Jekyll every time out, instead of Mr. Hyde.All statistics courtesy of\xc2\xa0Baseball-Reference.

The Baltimore Orioles defeated the Los Angeles Angels 4-2. Mandatory Credit: Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY SportsThe post-All-Star break road trip all Orioles fans were dreading turned out to be pretty positive. Ordinarily, the Orioles on the west coast is a recipe for disaster, but Baltimore managed to go 6-4 for the trip, and 5-2 for the week, on the back of excellent starting pitching.Oddly enough, the Orioles managed to lose ground in the AL East on the road trip. They had a four-game lead at the All-Star break over the New York Yankees, and now have a three-game lead over the Toronto Blue Jays, a four-game lead over the New York Yankees, and a seven-and-a-half-game lead over the resurgent Tampa Bay Rays.Despite a shrinking lead, the Orioles really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have expected \xc2\xa0too much more out of the road trip and should be happy the divisional situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t worst.Their hitting was non-existent for a majority of the road trip and it was only because of their starting pitching and bullpen performances that they are still in first place.Since coming back from the All-Star break, the Orioles have batted a combined .196, good for dead last in the AL.Steve Pearce and Nelson Cruz cooled off, Chris Davis continued to struggle, Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s hot hitting was interrupted by a three-game injury hiatus, forcing Ryan Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s cold bat into the lineup.Their pitching, however, saved the day. Specifically, Wei-Yin Chen (11-3, 3.92), Miguel Gonzalez (5-5, 3.91) and Chris Tillman (7-5, 3.92).It is a theme that has become prevalent in the 2014 season. Hitting disappears, pitching shows up.It is also this theme that brought the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 2012 playoff run to an end in New York during the ALDS.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers carried the team on their backs (with the exception of then-closer, Jim Johnson), but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough.If the Orioles want to make a prolonged playoff push in 2014, they really need to fix the inconsistencies in their lineup. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s through adjusting the order, adding a player via-trade, or just taking extra reps in the cages, Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 brass can\xe2\x80\x99t cross their fingers and hope the hitters aren\xe2\x80\x99t cold come October.As for right now, things are going right for Baltimore despite some glaring offensive issues.Offensive player of the week: Delmon Young. With just two games played over the week, Young made his limited playing time count. Going four-for-eight with a home run, a double, and three RBIs, Young provided an \xc2\xa0important spark for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup. It will be interesting to see how his playing time changes now that Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s bat has cooled.Pitcher of the week: Miguel Gonzalez went 1-0 for the week in his two starts. He combined to pitch 13.2 innings, allowing just three runs. He went from being potentially the odd-man out with the trade-deadline approaching, to being one of the hottest pitchers in the league. He now has pitched four consecutive quality starts.Coming up: The Orioles will get a much needed day off after a long flight back to Baltimore, and will resume play on Tuesday against the Anaheim Angels (Tuesday through Thursday) and then again against the Seattle Mariners (Friday through Sunday).A feeling of d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu, the Orioles again will face off against AL West teams before hitting the road again.Probable pitcher:Tuesday (7 P.M.

Lester is the kind of pitcher who would represent an unambiguous upgrade for the Orioles rotation. This is not debating whether Jorge de la Rosa will do better outside of Colorado or whatever. This is talking about renting a strong left-handed starter, who\'s dialed in for his contract year. Lester, in particular, is striking out about a quarter of all batters he faces, while he walks only about 5%. Those are very un-Orioles starter-like numbers. So\'s his 2.52 ERA, and so is the fact that he averages nearly seven innings per start. He\'s been so good that you almost can\'t even imagine him being on the Orioles because the Orioles, as a rule, don\'t get pitchers this good.    Of course, saying the Orioles have ""contacted"" the Red Sox about Lester isn\'t telling us very much. For all that we know, the conversation consisted of Dan Duquette asking the Sox if they had gone insane and decided to give away Lester just for laughs, and the Sox then hung up on him. It could have just as easily been Duquette calling up the Boston front office, hearing what they wanted back, and then moving elsewhere in his discussions.    The non-waiver deadline is Thursday at 4pm Eastern. When considering baseball rumors, one important thing to keep in mind is that the sheer volume of rumors is such that most of the time, a given rumor will amount to nothing at all. That doesn\'t mean it\'s false - although many of them probably are, even from respected reporters - just that the information it offers amounts to nothing. It could be true that the Orioles contacted the Red Sox about Lester and this fact could be completely and utterly meaningless in the scheme of who the O\'s do or don\'t acquire.    What would the Red Sox ask for two months of Lester? Probably more than the Orioles would be willing to give up, although I guess you never know. Barring an injury, he\'ll make another 10-12 starts, plus any that he might make in the postseason, should the team that trades for him get their way into the postseason. Lester is also due in the vicinity of $4.3 million for the remainder of the season. It\'ll probably never happen, but it\'s worth getting excited for a minute thinking about it. Now that the moment has passed, let\'s sit back and prepare ourselves for disappointment when Tim Berry is traded for two months of Kurt Suzuki.

', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Orioles trade targets: Daniel Murphy, Chris Coghlan ...', "" The 2014 Orioles are a good team. But they are also a flawed team (as is pretty much every baseball team in some way). Production from 2B ranks as 3rd worst in the majors in terms of Fangraphs' WAR calculation. Catching has been\xc2\xa09th worst, with Matt Wieters' replacements having combined for 0.0 fWAR. The rotation has accumulated the\xc2\xa06th lowest fWAR in the majors thus far, the 6th fewest innings, and the 3rd lowest K/9 rate. While the bullpen has been\xc2\xa0above average overall, that is largely built upon the fantastic seasons from Zach Britton, Darren O'Day, and Ryan Webb. The remainder have been near replacement level or, in the case of Brian Matusz, worse. One additional area of concern is the heavy right-handedness of the lineup. The Orioles currently carry four left-handed hitters: two starters and two options on the bench (David Lough & Ryan Flaherty) who are defense-first type players. So those are the areas the Orioles could stand to address as they look to make a run at winning the division for the first time sine 1997. Fortunately, there is an ample supply of talent at each of these positions who could be available via trade.    Certainly, it would be exhilarating if the O's could fix their 2B issue & upgrade the rotation via one trade by acquiring David Price and Ben Zobrist, or Cliff Lee and Chase Utley. But each of those pie-in-sky ideas would cost significant amounts of money and prospect talent.    Could it be worth it? Certainly, if the O's brought a 4th World Series championship to Baltimore. But winning the World Series is more a crapshoot than an equation to be solved. So here are a few more realistic trade ideas that could address multiple issues for the Orioles and help them at least better their chances of making the playoffs, which would then give them basically as good of odds of winning the World Series as any other team. Target #1: New York Mets' (2B) Daniel Murphy & (RP) Dana Eveland  I love Jonathan Schoop. His defense is great and I still believe in the future potential of his bat. But his bat has been abysmal this year (save for when he's crushing Earl Weaver Specials in New York). And this year is what matters since there are no guarantees the Orioles will be a similar situation next year. Daniel Murphy is a player who was\xc2\xa0rumored to have been checked in on by Orioles GM Dan Duquette during the off-season.    Heading into his age 29 season, Murphy had just put up a career high in home runs (13) with a solid triple slash line of .286 / .319 / .415 and he would be under team control through the 2015 season. So far this season Murphy has been just as good, slashing .287 / .335 / .406. Even more enticing is that he has hit lefties even better than righties so far in 2014 (.818 OPS vs. .718 OPS). You may remember Dana Eveland from the 2012 season, when he made two less than inspiring spot-starts but was otherwise decent out of the bullpen. He spent all of 2013 in Korean baseball, but returned this season when the Mets offered him a minor league deal. He's pitched in just 15 games so far, but has pitched very well, putting up a 2.16 ERA and 14 Ks to 3 BBs. With the way Matusz has pitched this season, Eveland could represent a more sturdy LOOGY option for Buck Showalter. Other potential targets on the Mets: (SP) Bartolo Colon, (OF/DH) Bobby Abreu    Target #2: Chicago Cubs' (RP) Wesley Wright & (OF) Chris Coghlan  The 29-year-old Wright has been great for the Cubs this season, putting up a 2.28 ERA & 2.92 FIP over 27.2 innings. The bulk of that success has been due to his limiting hard contact, as he has put up career rates for HR % (0.9%) and XBH % (3.5%) along with a solid 1.39 GB/FB ratio. So long as the regression monster doesn't get him, he could be a tremendous weapon out of the 'pen. Chris Coghlan is a former Rookie of the Year winner ('09) and was born in Gaithersburg, MD. He struggled in parts of four seasons with the Marlins post-RoY award before getting non-tendered this past off-season. He signed on with the Cubs to a minor league deal and has found some decent success as a platoon bat vs. RHP with a season slash line of .273 / .355 / .472. His defense is, well...the defensive metrics are not kind, let's put it that way. But his bat could give the O's a significantly more formidable pinch hitting option vs. righty relievers. Other potential targets on the Cubs: (INF) Luis Valbuena, (LHP) James Russell Target #3: Cleveland Indians' (SP) Justin Masterson & (INF) Asdrubal Cabrera  Both more well-known names, each is a free agent after the season. Both have also lost a lot of their shine as once impact players. Masterson has been beset by knee injuries this season, his fastball is down below 90 mph average velocity, and he gets absolutely clobbered by lefty batters. But if the scouts potentially see signs of hope in a mechanical tweak or that he is recovered from his injuries then he has the potential of being a strong front-end starter coming down the stretch. ZiPS is optimistic regarding his rest of season potential as well, projecting a strong pull-back in his babip & BB/9 leading to a drop in his ERA of a run and a half. Cabrera has played shortstop primarily, but does have previous experience at 2B, where the defensive metrics view him much more favorably. A switch-hitter, he would provide the O's offense with another left-handed bat, which could make them less vulnerable to righty slider monster bullpen arms. His splits show him to be slightly better from the left hand side (.711 OPS) than from the right side (.679 OPS).    Going after these two would be a huge 'high risk / high reward' move. But the 1.6 fWAR that ZiPS projects them to combine to produce over the remainder of the season doubles what ZiPS forecasts for Miguel Gonzalez and Schoop. This could well be the difference between the O's making winning the AL East and getting an early start to their off-season. Other potential targets on Cleveland: (OF) Chris Dickerson, (RP) Marc Rzepczynski It's clear the O's have areas where they could upgrade significantly. While it would be exciting to see Duquette make a big move for an All-Star caliber player, it does not strike me as being his modus operandi. But one of these combination moves for less heralded players could serve the Orioles well as they make a push for a second playoff berth in 3 seasons.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles pitcher Kevin Gausman has a rare arm. You can\xe2\x80\x99t teach 98-mph fastballs in the seventh inning. You can teach placement, sequence, and secondary pitches that will make the fastballs even more unhittable. And all of this is what young Kevin Gausman is learning.Before his last call-up to the Orioles, my friend Blaine Beatty \xe2\x80\x93 the pitching coach at AA Bowie \xe2\x80\x93 sent me a text message with a picture of the two of them. He simply entitled it, \xe2\x80\x9cOur future.\xe2\x80\x9d Blaine is one of those in the organization who has worked with Gausman to encourage the development of his secondary stuff. And when it all comes together \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 it is regularly going to look like it did Wednesday night in Baltimore.\xc2\xa0For the first 14 Angels batters, Gausman was in total control. None reached base; nothing was hit particularly hard. Gausman was living on the corners and his secondary pitches were salted and peppered into the sequence in a fashion that kept everyone completely off balance.This could become a regular experience. Teams around Major League Baseball know this, and Dan Duquette is probed continuously about Guasman\xe2\x80\x99s potential availability at times such as this trade deadline.It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen. DD is not going to mortgage the future in any event. And why give away the future when the future is today? What was seen Wednesday night is as good as most anything that could be secured in return. Gausman is very quickly learning on the job. Becoming a successful major league pitcher has a learning curve \xe2\x80\xa6 along with learning a curve.Becoming a successful major league pitcher has a learning curve \xe2\x80\xa6 along with learning a curve. (Did you catch that? I went figurative on you before I went literal.) Lessons were learned on this evening \xe2\x80\x93 Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s 15th career start in the big leagues \xe2\x80\x93 on the way to getting a 4-3 win and pushing his record to 5-3 for this season.Orioles broadcaster Rick Dempsey is famous for saying that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing good happens after a walk.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, if that is true, then it is three-times as true that nothing good happens after three consecutive walks.With 14 consecutive Angels having been sent back to the dugout, Gausman walked three batters in a row to load the bases with two outs in the top of the fifth inning. Two run-scoring hits immediately followed and the O\xe2\x80\x99s 4-0 lead was reduced to 4-3. Mike Trout was at the plate with runners at second and third. Gausman threw five fastballs ranging from 96-99 mph before fanning him with an 88-mph forkball to end the threat and put out the fire.If the truth be told, Gausman should have been out of that inning before any hits were registered. He did not get calls on the corners several times. And telling the truth on this matter means telling the truth (from my six decades of avidly watching this sport) that plate umpires in MLB are worse not than they have ever been. Variation from ump to ump is understandable, but the inconsistencies are inning-by-inning realities.Gausman fell into a pattern over this series of five batters that reached base where he attempted to be just a little bit too fine, rather than trusting his stuff. He got out of rhythm with the umpire as he was suddenly throwing more balls out of the zone. No umpire (except the most grandiosely arrogant) want to draw all the attention to themselves by ending a big rally with giving the pitcher a strike call on the black. Gausman should have been out of the inning.

In the process, he saved the bullpen while getting the Orioles to Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day in the eighth inning and Zach Britton in the ninth.

There is no way he will be pitching for anyone else before he becomes a free agent well into the future.The Baltimore Orioles have really played their cards well with Kevin Gausman. Duquette is not exactly a wizard\xe2\x80\x94as that designation is for the GM of a different sort of bird in the Baltimore Harbor area. But the decision to limit Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s innings early in the season so as to have them available for the final two months is \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 looking at this point as the calendar turns over into August to be a very, very wise decision. "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Duquette probably not done', 'Photo: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe trade deadline is a confusing time for any baseball G.M. On the one hand, contending teams want to add talent that could push them into the playoffs and potentially a World Series. This is especially true in an era where players leaving during free agency is so common that keeping a core group of players together for a multiple years can be difficult. Because of this G.M.\xe2\x80\x99s know that the window for a World Series run is most likely small.However, on the other hand when it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious some core players may be lost to free agency, it can be dangerous trading away the young talent that could one day replace them. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to find the balance between win now and build for the future.If the season ended tonight the Orioles would join Oakland, Los Angelos Angels, Detroit and Toronto in the playoffs. Out of those teams it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious Oakland and Detroit made the most headlines at the trade deadline. However, just because the Orioles failed to close any of the numerous headline-grabbing deals they were linked to doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 G.M. Dan Duquette is giving up trying to make the team better for the playoff run.It\xe2\x80\x99s true that teams are always looking to acquire pitching, specifically a front of the line starter. However, there is a large market for starting pitching which means a lot of teams to outbid. A cheaper option may be to add a veteran position player into one of the weaker spots in the lineup, which would be second base and catcher.Ryan Flaherty and Jonathan Schoop have played excellent in the field and have both collected key hits. However, combined the two are hitting .211 with 117 strikeouts and 12 homeruns. Flaherty would probably do better in a full-time utility role and Schoop would probably benefit from some at-bats in AAA. If the Orioles could add a Gordon Beckham or Brandon Phillips type player it would do a lot to lengthen the lineup, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cost the team a top prospect.Catcher may be the most difficult move to make. Throwing even a veteran into handling an entirely new pitching staff mid-way through a season is a lot to ask, and the platoon of Caleb Joseph and Nick Hundley has been terrific defensively. However, the Orioles have gotten almost no production offensively from the position since Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 injury. Joseph is hitting just .192 while Hundley is hitting .209 since becoming an Oriole. Teams tend not to part with good catchers, but the Orioles could find a veteran in even the second-tier of catchers that would be an upgrade.Anyone who has followed the Orioles knows Dan Duquette doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shy away from a deal, and the Birds did get better today by adding Andrew Miller. Just because the trade deadline has come and go doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the Orioles are done making moves. Duquette is well aware of his team\xe2\x80\x99s short comings, and is probably on the phone with teams right now.

But thankfully Wei-Yin Chen was there to cheer you up with another outstanding starting performance. Through the first three innings of the game, the only baserunner that that Mariners had reached on an infield single by Robinson Cano. With two outs in the first inning and the infield shifted to the right side, Cano hit a ball on the ground towards third base. Machado managed to get to the ball and even make a throw, but he just couldn't get Cano at first. Chen wasn't fazed as he went on to retire the next eight batters before he let Cano reach again, this time on a solid single to left field. When the Orioles got a run in the third inning of tonight's game, I thought maybe they would go on to score a bunch more and make us all feel better. Delmon Young, who was playing left field tonight (more on that in a minute), led off the third inning with a double, and after Caleb Joseph and Jonathan Schoop struck out, it looked like he might be stranded. But Nick Markakis hit a ball about halfway between third base and home plate that died on the grass (and maybe had a little help from catcher Mike Zunino, who picked it up before it stopped rolling). Young moved to third base on the infield single, then came in to score on a line drive back up the middle by Machado. Nice! That put two runners on for Adam Jones, but the birthday boy struck out on one of the ugliest swings I've seen in awhile. Unfortunately the Orioles didn't get to enjoy their lead for too long. Chen struck out Dustin Ackley for the first out in the fourth, but then the previously mentioned Cano single put a runner on base. Kendrys Morales hit a ball down the left field line that Delmon Young did not play well. Morales would have had a double no matter what, but the Mariners third base coach had begun motioning for Cano to stop at third. But when he saw Young moseying after the ball in left field, he changed his mind and waved him in. Young threw in to the relay man and Hardy's relay throw home was almost perfect. If Joseph had held on to the ball it could have been interesting, but it trickled away from him. I think he would have been safe either way, but it would have been very close.    That tied the game, which sucked, but Chen got right back to being awesome, which did not. He retired Kyle Seager and Chris Denorfia, then cruised through the fifth, sixth, and seventh innings with little trouble. Ackley did reach third base in the sixth on a single and two ground outs, but Chen struck out Seager to strand him.    So while Chen was mowing down the Mariners, the Orioles were laying an egg against Mariners' starter Roenis Elias. They found themselves with two on and just one out in the fourth inning after Nelson Cruz doubled and J.J. Hardy walked, but Young hit into a 6-4-3 double play to end the inning. Curses! Wasting a Cruz hit AND a Hardy walk is just a shame. (Although to be fair, Cruz's double was mostly a misplay by center fielder Austin Jackson, but since Cruz had been 0 for his last 21, we'll cut him some slack) In the sixth inning the Orioles got another leadoff double, this one from Machado. They got lucky on the next play, when M's shortstop Chris Taylor fielded a ground ball from Adam Jones. Manny ran to third on contact and Taylor thought about going to third base to try and tag him. Taylor hesitated, dropped the ball, and couldn't get anyone out. Manny looked far enough from third that a good quick throw probably would have gotten him, but at the very least Taylor should have had the play at first.    Just like in the third inning, the Orioles had a runner in scoring position with no outs, only to see the next two batters strike out. This time it was Cruz and Chris Davis. Sigh. At least Joseph and Schoop have the excuse that \xc2\xa0they are Joseph and Schoop. Cruz and Davis are, in theory, the heart of the order. They both struck out looking, and while Cruz\xc2\xa0should have been ashamed of himself, Davis at least had\xc2\xa0a right to some beef  with the umpire. Thankfully for those two jokers, Hardy wasn't in the mood to play any more extra innings. He hit a sharp single back up the middle that went past a diving Cano, resulting in a 2-1 Orioles lead on an unearned run. Roenis was pulled from the game with two on and two out, and Young grounded out on the first pitch from relief pitcher Tom Wilhelmsen to end the inning. Finally given another lead, Chen didn't let this one get away. He pitched a very quick seventh inning and started the eighth with 94 pitches. That's the danger zone for Chen, but Buck Showalter had new Oriole Andrew Miller warming in the pen. Chen got Chris Taylor to pop up for the first out, but then walked Austin Jackson. Buck pulled him then, at exactly the right time in my opinion. The crowd of 39,487 gave Chen a huge ovation as he walked off the field, and he deserved it. Well done, Wei-Yin Chen!    Just as the roar for Chen died down, it picked up again as the Ryan Wagner introduced Andrew Miller to the crowd. It was a nice warm welcome to the newest Oriole, and he almost got his team out of the inning immediately with a ground ball to second base. Schoop went to Hardy at second for the first out, but the relay throw wasn't in time. The ball just wasn't hit hard enough and Ackley beat it out. Ackley then took off for second base with Cano at the plate, and Joseph made a rare defensive miscue, throwing the ball past second base and into center field. Ackley raced to third base. Once Ackley got off of first base, it looked like Miller didn't mind pitching around Cano. Can you blame him? Cano went to first with a walk, and Miller got a ground ball to shortstop from Morales to end the inning. Welcome to Birdland, Andrew Miller! An insurance run would have been nice at that point, don't you think? Sure, Zach Britton is a shut down closer, but things happen. Machado singled to start the bottom of the eighth and things looked promising. It was Manny's third hit of the night! But then after Jones flew out, Manny ran on a ball hit in air by Cruz. It was hit kinda hard, and kind of towards the gap, but some on, Manny. Ackley made the catch in left and easily doubled Manny off of first to end the inning. Just for that he's not going on the MBP ballot! That'll teach him. Thankfully they didn't need the insurance run, because Britton made it look easy in the ninth. A ground ball to shortstop, a ground ball to second base, and a fly ball to left and the game was over. O's win! Good night.

08/02/2014,"[(""The Baltimore Orioles - Not Buck Showalter's First Rodeo"", ""From 1998 to 2012, the Baltimore Orioles were one of the most disastrous franchises in baseball. After making the playoffs in 2012 and winning 85 games in 2013, they have recently\xc2\xa0become one of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s premier teams. A\xc2\xa0reason, perhaps the biggest reason \xe2\x80\x93 Buck Showalter.They failed to end the season with a winning record in any year from 1998 through 2011 and only eclipsed the 70-win mark once. In 2012, they came out of nowhere and made a magical playoff run. The team won 16 extra-inning games in a row, the closer Jim Johnson saved 51 ball games in 54 attempts; they went 29-9 in one-run games and got career-years from multiple players.In 2012, they ended the year 93-69 and made the playoffs as a wild card team. They upset the favored Texas Rangers in the first-ever American League Wild Card game before extending the New York Yankees to five games in the American League Divisional Series. The O\xe2\x80\x99s won 85 games the following year, proving to the baseball world that the Baltimore Orioles are back on the map.The main reason for the sudden turn of events was the Manger of the bullpen by the name of Buck Showalter. He has a history of turning losing teams into winning ones in the blink of an eye.Starting with Yankees: He took over as manager in 1992 when they finished the season with a 76-86 record. They won less than 75 games in each of the last three years as well. In 1993 \xe2\x80\x93 one year after Showalter took over the team \xe2\x80\x93 the Yankees won 88 games finishing second in the American League East division, which contained seven teams at the time.Live Feed Buck Showalter10 things we've learned so far this MLB season FanSidedBaltimore Orioles execute a weird triple play on Boston Red Sox FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck Showalter The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Buck Showalter's Most Memorable Ejections The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles Clicking on All Cylinders The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: A hot start for Chris Davis could offset a trend of missed postseason appearances The Baltimore WireThe next year the Yankees won the division with a 70-43 record in a strike-shortened season. In Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s final year with the Yankees (1995), they finished the year with a 79-65 record, which means \xc2\xa0he lead a team that had losing records in four straight years to having winning records in three straight years.After a a three-year absence from the managerial position, he made similar magic with the Arizona Diamondbacks. After winning 65 games in his first year there, the D-Backs all of a sudden won 100 games in 1992, earning the division crown. After another three year absence, he was signed by the Texas Rangers and did the same exact thing to them, except it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite as impactful. After winning 71 games in his first season with the Rangers (2003), he lead them 89 wins in 2004.After laving the Rangers in 2006, he served as a baseball analyst on ESPN for a few years, before being signed by the Orioles at the end of the 2010 season. After leading the worst team in baseball to a 34-23 record in the last 57 games of the season, the O\xe2\x80\x99s won just 69 games in 2011. However, all it meant was that his magic would be delayed by just one year as the O\xe2\x80\x99s won 93 games in 2012, 85 in 2013, and have gone 60-47 through the first 105 games in his fifth season with the Orioles.Here are his career managerial stats:RkYearAgeTmLgWLW-L%GFinishWpostLpostW-L%post1199236New York YankeesAL7686.46916242199337New York YankeesAL8874.54316223199438New York YankeesAL7043.61911314199539New York YankeesAL7965.54914525199842Arizona DiamondbacksNL6597.40116256199943Arizona DiamondbacksNL10062.61716217200044Arizona DiamondbacksNL8577.52516238200347Texas RangersAL7191.43816249200448Texas RangersAL8973.549162310200549Texas RangersAL7983.488162311200650Texas RangersAL8082.494162312201054Baltimore OriolesAL3rd of 33423.59657513201155Baltimore OriolesAL6993.426162514201256Baltimore OriolesAL9369.574162215201357Baltimore OriolesAL8577.525162316201458Baltimore OriolesAL6047.5611071It makes you wonder why no teams gave him a chance in the 11 years he was free for.The knock on him is that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to maintain any of those teams as he has never had longer then a four-year stint with any specific club. However, that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the case with the Orioles. He has already been with the team for four and a half seasons and will be with the team at least through the 2017 season as they signed him to a three-year extension last year.I\xe2\x80\x99m a big fan of saying: coach\xe2\x80\x99s don\xe2\x80\x99t win games, players do; but there are few exceptions and Showalter is one of them. In 2012, the Orioles did nothing to upgrade on roster from the 69 wins in 2011, yet they still won 34 more games. How do you explain that?\xc2\xa0 "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: A win for Wei-Yin Chen and for Taiwan', 'Wei-Yin Chen said something after last night\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 victory that really struck me. He told Steve Melewski of masnsports.com of a tragedy that had occurred in his hometown back in Taiwan:Unfortunately back in my hometown, there was a horrible accident \xe2\x80\x93 a gas explosion which took away thousands of lives.\xc2\xa0Today, this win I would like to give out to my home people and I want to send out my best wishes. Hope everyone is all right there.I echo Chen\xe2\x80\x99s sentiments; I hope that that all of the affected people are doing as well as can be expected. I think that sometimes we take for granted how difficult it might be for someone like Wei-Yin Chen to have to come to America and not only be expected to pitch at the highest level but also to learn our culture and be so far from all of the people he knows and loves. \xc2\xa0Ultimately, baseball\xe2\x80\x99s just a game. What happened in Chen\xe2\x80\x99s hometown is real life. In a game that he dedicated to folks back in his homeland, Chen didn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line:Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sports7.1 IP, 5 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 8 K. Those eight strikeouts were a career-high for Wei-Yin Chen, who seemed to mix his pitches very well throughout his outing last night. He\xe2\x80\x99s never been the hardest thrower in the world, but the way Chen gets hitters out is through late movement in the strike zone, which if applied correctly can be deadly. Seattle saw that first hand last night.Unfortunately for the Baltimore Orioles, Seattle starter Roenis Elias was almost just as good. He stymied Oriole bats for most of the night. Seattle has one of the best starting staffs and bullpens in the league, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be overly concerned about Oriole bats. In fact, it should be duly noted that the Orioles won this game without the benefit of the home run ball.The O\xe2\x80\x99s took a 1-0 lead in the third when Manny Machado singled home Delmon Young from third base. Young had led off the inning with a double, and he went to third on Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x98 infield single. However Seattle came right back in the fourth. Robinson Cano reached on a one-out single, and he was doubled home by Kendrys Morales. There was a close play at the plate, and for a split second it appeared that the Orioles might have Cano nailed at home. However catcher Caleb Joseph dropped the ball, and the game was tied.Machado led off the sixth with a double off the scoreboard in right field, which came mere feet away from leaving the yard. However Machado also got a pass in a sense when he made a mental mistake a few moments later. On a grounder that was hit by Adam Jones to Machado\xe2\x80\x99s right, he broke for third. However shortstop Chris Taylor misplayed the ball, allowing Jones to reach (on an error) and allowing Machado to get to third. Base runners are taught to stay on second base if a ball\xe2\x80\x99s hit to their right side; it\xe2\x80\x99s also very possible that Taylor was so surprised to see Machado in motion that he misplayed the ball.Either way, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had runners at the corners after Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s error. J.J. Hardy ran the count full (with two outs) before singling up the middle into center field. Machado touched home, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s held a 2-1 lead.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 newest acquisition, Andrew Miller, recorded the final two outs in the eighth inning to bridge the gap to Zach Britton in the ninth. Miller received a great ovation from the faithful at Camden Yards, which really took him for a ride if his postgame comments are any indication. He seemed to really appreciate the fact that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans were happy to have him on the team for the rest of the way; these types of situations can be awkward (coming to a new team mid-year) especially given the fact that Miller came from a division rival, but Miller seems to have had no trouble fitting in thus far.Britton sent Seattle down 1-2-3 in the ninth, and the Orioles had themselves a 2-1 win over Seattle. Boston also beat NY while Houston beat Toronto, putting the Orioles back up by 2.5 games in first place. The series continues this evening with Miguel Gonzalez taking to the hill for the Birds. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by James Paxton.Before yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game the Orioles also announced that they had signed LHP Joe Saunders (a former Oriole in his own right) to a minor league contract. Saunders formerly pitched for Texas, but was released earlier this year. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how, if at all, the O\xe2\x80\x99s plan on using Saunders (at the big league level, that is), but either way it\xe2\x80\x99s a move to shore up organizational depth. Furthermore, if Dan Duquette had been considering trading for a starter on waivers this month, the signing of Saunders might in effect fill that gap and save the Orioles a prospect.

The two other American League division leaders added aces at the nonwaiver trading deadline on Thursday, with the Oakland Athletics trading for Jon Lester from Boston and the Detroit Tigers acquiring David Price from Tampa Bay.

Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY SportsFollowing up on a season in which Chris Davis hit .286/.370/.634, won the Silver Slugger Award, finished third in MVP voting, and smashed a MLB-leading 53 home runs and 138 RBI was going to be difficult. No one expected a repeat performance. However, no one expected this type of regression, either.In 2014, Davis has been a liability at the plate when he used to be one of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 biggest assets. We knew he had the potential to be an all-or-nothing type of batter, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing\xe2\x80\x9d meant a sub-.200 batting average while still leading the team in strikeouts and placing ninth on the team in slugging percentage.That\xe2\x80\x99s not the Chris Davis we fell in love with last year. It\xe2\x80\x99s not even the extremely solid .270/.326/.501 power hitter he was in 2012.No, this is a new Chris Davis. A, dare I say, bad Chris Davis. And because of that, it\xe2\x80\x99s also a Chris Davis who deserves to see the field less.Orioles manager Buck Showalter always expresses patience with his players \xe2\x80\x94 often saying that if they can play defense, he\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for the bat to come around.Chris Davis can play defense. This year, he\xe2\x80\x99s posted his highest fielding percentage ever as a first baseman \xe2\x80\x94 a gold glove potential .997. His big frame and uncanny ability to stretch and scoop balls in the dirt provides a forgiving target for Orioles infielders.But the time has come to lessen the impact of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 struggles. The Orioles have other options at first base in Steve Pearce and Nick Markakis. Putting Pearce or Markakis at first allows the hot-hitting Delmon Young to see the field in a corner outfield position and improves the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense. The offensive improvement Young brings overcomes the advantage Davis holds over the other first base options on defense.Davis has hit .193/.267/.376 vs. left-handed pitching this year. Meanwhile, Young has hit .255/.255/.400 against lefties this year and holds a .301/.337/.467 career average against them.When the Orioles face a lefty, it presents the best opportunity to get Davis out of the lineup and give Young a few more at-bats.Until the Orioles are confident that Davis can get back to where he was in 2012 or 2013, other players give the team a better chance to win than he does. With the Orioles only 2.5 games ahead of the second-place Toronto Blue Jays in the AL East, every at-bat counts. When Chris Davis is up, Baltimore is giving away those precious at-bats in hopes that the Davis of yesteryear reverses a trend that has gone on far too long.

The Mariners defeated the Orioles 6-3. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsMany years ago I played on the golf team for my high school. My coach was a colorful personality filled with great one-liners. And when I would leave a putt a foot short of the hole, he would say, \xe2\x80\x9cRandy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that it is statistically true that 95% of putts that are left short of the hole don\xe2\x80\x99t go in?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Indeed. True statement.The same is true in baseball with runners in scoring position (RISP). When a team does not get a hit in that situation, it is virtually impossible to win the game \xe2\x80\xa6 probably not 100% as on the golf green, but nearly that bad.Until Ryan Flaherty delivered a pinch hit two-out RBI in the ninth inning on Saturday night, the Baltimore Orioles were 0-for-11 with RISP. The Birds simply could not get runners home, in spite of opportunities throughout the game.The first Orioles run was delivered by Adam Jones in the bottom of the first inning on a ground out to second, and Caleb Joseph hit a solid homer into the left-field corner. That was about it for scoring, as the Baltimore Orioles dropped the second game of the series to the Seattle Mariners 6-3.Miguel Gonzalez simply did not have his good stuff on this evening. His command was loose, and his balls did not have the late movement that so often makes him difficult to hit.Gonzo yielded a solo shot in the third inning to Dustin Ackley, but the big blow of the game was a fifth inning three-run bomb by Robinson Cano that gave the Mariners a 4-1 lead at that point. The Orioles have historically been killed by Cano, and they have been fortunate so far this season to have kept him under control \xe2\x80\xa6 until last night.As I wrote in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s article about the final third of the season, the Mariners statistically have the best pitching staff in the American League, even slightly better than the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s.But somehow the Baltimore Orioles have got to find some more offense. Where is it going to come from?Back on July 25th I wrote an article entitled \xe2\x80\x9cIs Nelson Cruz becoming a Hole in the Baltimore Orioles Lineup?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Well the answer is in; and the answer is \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He struck out three times last night and is flailing wildly at low and outside pitches.In his last 20 games, Cruz is 8-for-82 (.097) with one home run and two RBIs.

But on June 24th, the O\xe2\x80\x99s beat him 4-0 on the particular strength of a three-run homer by Delmon Young.How about if Buck gives Cruz a day off and lets Young DH, with David Lough in left field? I support that \xe2\x80\xa6 gotta shake up something with this offense.The Orioles will need another Chris \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Davis \xe2\x80\x93 to carry them on Sunday afternoon.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWhenever I hear Joe Saunders brought up into a conversation about baseball, my mind always drifts back to that day in October of 2012 when he pitched 5 2/3 innings of work in the American League Wild Card Game. He helped the Orioles advance to the ALDS to face the Yankees by allowing just one run and striking out four batters during his start.Since then he has pitched for the Mariners in 2013 and the Rangers this season where in eight games he posted a 6.13 ERA and an 0-5 record. Most recently, Saunders has been playing for Kansity City\xe2\x80\x99s Triple-A \xc2\xa0affiliate where he had an even more unimpressive 6.75 ERA in four starts with the ball club. Because of this performance he was released by the Royals earlier last week.The last time he posted good numbers from the mound were in 2012 with the Buckle Up Birds when he had a 3.63 ERA over seven games with Baltimore. You could say Saunders had Oriole Magic pumping through his veins that year.In an attempt to get that Oriole Magic back in his arm, the Orioles signed Saunders to a Minor League contract on Friday. He will report on Monday to the Norfolk Tides. He will report to the Tides however not as a starter, but as a relief pitcher.This is a low-risk, high reward move by Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter. There are no promises that Saunders will turn things around with the Tides and be Major League-ready come September when the Orioles call up many players for their final push to the Postseason.However, the Orioles have made a habit of turning unreliable starters into great relief pitchers. Just looking at Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s current roster alone, there are two pitchers that come to mind. Tommy Hunter was a starter in 2011 and 2012 for the Orioles where he had a combined 10-11 record with a 5.26 ERA. In 2013, Hunter made the switch to the bullpen and saw immediate improvements. Last season he had a 2.81 ERA. Although he struggled in the closer role early this season, Hunter settled in nicely as a set-up man and now has a 3.86 ERA.Zach Britton, after three seasons with over a 4.60 ERA, has been \xe2\x80\x9clights-0ut\xe2\x80\x9d in 2014 as a reliever and as a closer. With 22 saves under his belt this season, Britton has become one of the more reliable closers in the Majors.\xc2\xa0Could Saunders be yet another starter-turned-reliever in the Orioles organization?

08/04/2014,"[(""Orioles' bats break out in 7-3 win over the Nationals ..."", "" The Orioles bats finally broke out tonight as they scored seven runs in support of Kevin Gausman, who lasted six innings despite clearly not having his best stuff. It turned out that all the O's bat needed to get back in action was some NL pitching, as they scored more than four runs for only the third time since the All-Star break. Gausman was shaky throughout the entire game, but as Caleb Joseph said in his postgame interview with Gary Thorne and Mike Bordick, he threw just enough good fastballs to stay out of major damage. In his six innings pitched he didn't have a single 1-2-3 inning and gave up a total of eight hits and two walks. Gausman gave up back-to-back two-out singles in the first inning, but struck out Ian Desmond to strand the runners. But the Nationals got on the board first in the second inning on a solo home run from Wilson Ramos. The Orioles had a good chance to score in the top of the second, when Chris Davis walked and J.J. Hardy singled with one out, but Davis had a major TOOTBLAN, being doubled off of second base easily after Ryan Flaherty flew out to center field. Oh, Chris. You make me so sad. It was a nice night at the plate for Joseph, and he tied the game at 1-1 in the top of the third inning. He hit a solo home run, his 5th, to left field. It was a no doubter, and I have to ask: Is there any player on the Orioles more fun to see succeed than Caleb Joseph?    Gausman really played with fire in both the third and fourth innings as the the Nationals put runners on first and third with no outs in each. But in each inning, Gausman limited the damage to just one run. In the third he gave up a sacrifice fly and in the fourth he allowed a run to score on a double play ball.    The way the Orioles have been scoring runs lately, a 3-1 deficit felt less like two runs and more like 10. But they got one back on a home run by Nick Markakis in the fifth inning, then broke out for three in the seventh to go ahead for good. The Nationals started Tanner Roark tonight and the word on the street is that he's a good pitcher. He looked ok early on, but by the time he was knocked out of the game, I didn't see what the fuss was about. Back-to-back doubles by Hardy and Flaherty (Flarht's was THIS close to being a homer) tied the game, and after Joseph moved Flaherty to third with a bunt, pinch hitter Delmon Young singled up the middle. That made the score 4-3, but the Orioles weren't finished. Ross Detwiler replaced Roark but wasn't much better. Both Markakis and Manny Machado singled to load the bases.    Adam Jones then stepped to the plate, the 7th batter of the inning. Adam to that point had been 0-for-August, but it ended with an RBI single. The O's looked ready to really break out as they still had the bases loaded with just one out, but the Debbie Downer we know as Nelson Cruz grounded into a double play to end the inning. Those runs put Gausman in line to get a win, though he struggled for it. While he didn't give up any more runs after the fourth inning, he did allow a single in the fifth inning and two more baserunners in the sixth. He was pinch hit for by Young in the top of the seventh inning and replaced on the mound by Brad Brach in the bottom of the inning. His final pitching line was: 6 IP, 8 H, 3 R, 2 BB, 3 K, 1 HR, 107 pitches/60 strikes. He battled, as they say. Brach was outstanding in relief, pitching two perfect innings with two strikeouts. His reward was getting to bat for himself in the top of the ninth, and he gave the ball a ride to center field, but sadly it was an easy out for Denard Span. Brach has really been a pleasant surprise this season, don't you think?    The O's last two runs came in the eighth inning on a two-RBI single by Joseph. He knocked in Davis, who had singled just through the shift in right field, and Hardy, who was on base with his fourth hit of the day. Though Brach had just batted for himself, Darren O'Day still came in to pitch the ninth. He was awesome, as usual. He retired all three batters he faced on a total of nine pitches, and he struck out Danny Espinosa swinging to end the game. O's win! They gain 1/2 game on the idle Blue Jays and will head into Toronto with a four-game lead in the American League East.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

His current ERA is pretty nice, but his peripherals suggest some luck involved, as he has a career-low BABiP (.279) and an above-average strand rate. Buehrle this year looks more like the pitcher Toronto thought they were getting after their big trade with the Marlins in the '12-'13 offseason. His current ERA is impressive, but even someone who has such a track record of defying his peripherals probably can't keep the gap quite so large all year. Buehrle throws three fastballs (four-seamer, sinker, and cutter), plus a curveball and changeup. He pitches lefties and righties pretty similarly, using his fastballs nearly two-thirds of the time and his change a little more than his curve. The main difference is that he goes to his sinker as an out pitch against righties, while he prefers his changeup late in the count against fellow lefties. Maybe hot: Nick Markakis (1.154 OPS, 50 PA), Delmon Young (1.108 OPS, 50 PA)    Likely not: J.J.

Oddly enough, he hasn't made a start against Toronto since late 2012. Chen's FIP-ERA difference might suggest he's benefited from some luck, but his HR/FB% is still a little high (12.7%). His xFIP, which adjusts FIP based on a league-average home run rate, is 3.70, in line with his ERA.    Hutchison lost part of 2012 and most of 2013 to Tommy John surgery, not seeing any time in the majors last year. His peripherals this year are decent (strikeout and walk rates right around the league average), but his ERA isn't, despite the usual indicators of luck (BABiP, LOB%, HR/FB%) suggesting nothing out of the ordinary. The righty throws mostly four-seam fastballs a little over half of the time to all hitters, adding the occasional two-seamer. Against righties, he'll also turn to his slider in all counts, while against lefties, he saves it for when he's ahead in the count or has two strikes, mixing in changeups instead in other counts. Thursday, August 7, 7:07 ET: Miguel Gonzalez @ J.A. Happ      Gonzalez Happ   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 171.1 107.2 92.2 95.1   ERA 3.78 3.93 4.56 4.34   FIP 4.45 5.30 4.31 4.25   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .243/.300/.413 .274/.343/.469 .250/.333/.401 .270/.337/.430      Gonzalez has managed two quality starts in three outings since the All-Star break, giving up three runs over 13.2 on the West Coast but allowing four runs in five innings at Camden Yards on Saturday. All things considered, that's pretty good, since he's struck out only seven and walked just as many over that span. Gonzalez's FIP frightens me, folks. Like Chen, he's perhaps had some tough luck with home runs (13.5% HR/FB, 4.65 xFIP), but a lot of his apparent success this year is in his well-above-average strand rate (81.9% LOB).    After suffering some lower back issues and starting off the season in Toronto's bullpen, Happ's been a fairly typical back-end starter. His numbers aren't great, and he averages less than six innings per start, but he's stuck in the rotation since early May. The Orioles saw him back in June and managed only one run over six innings. Happ throws lots of fastballs, mostly four-seamers, but some sinkers and cutters, too. Fellow lefties see offspeed stuff just 10% of the time, and while righties see changeups more often, Happ still throws over 75% fastballs to them.

The good news is that only one of those hits went for extra bases, an RBI double in the 3rd where the runner scored from 1B. 5 runners allowed to reach base on Wright's watch would score, but just two of those would be considered 'earned'. A Jimmy Paredes throwing error led to the first of the 3 unearned runs by allowing a batter to reach 1B. But Wright compounded the problem by walking the next batter before allowing back-to-back singles. (LF) Quintin Berry helped Wright's cause out by throwing out a runner at home plate. This would mark the end of Wright's time in the game, but Brock Huntzinger would come on in relief an allow both inherited runners to score.

Many teams that come to play the Nationals make trips there, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s have stopped in many times in the past during the Battle of the Beltways. The O\xe2\x80\x99s came away impressed by the wounded soldiers that they saw there, as well as with the level of care that they were seeing at Walter Reed. Again, that was probably the most important part of the day, hands down \xe2\x80\x93 and then they played the game.Anyone who saw the game probably came away with the idea that Kevin Gausman struggled. And while he certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t have his best stuff, he\xe2\x80\x99s credited with a quality start. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 8 H, 3 R, 2 BB, 3 K. One area where Gausman got in trouble was throwing strike one\xe2\x80\xa6in that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it very often. He got behind in counts and he nibbled at the strike zone, although there were times when it might have been fair to wonder where the strike zone was actually located. But in fact, Gausman allowed a run here and there and while he bent on Washington\xe2\x80\x99s offense, he never broke.Washington took a 1-0 lead in the second when catcher Wilson Ramos homered to right center. But the Baltimore Orioles battled back, in what would be theme for the night; Caleb Joseph wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be outdone, and he sent a solo homer of his own over the left field fence in the third. However as I said, Gausman bent but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t break; Ian Desmond\xc2\xa0would put Washington ahead 2-1 in the last of the inning as he scored a run from third on a GIDP. Ramos would come up again in the fourth and do the exact same thing. Washington led 3-1 and Gausman seemed to be struggling, however the fact that he traded those two runs for four outs ended up being huge.Nick Markakis brought the O\xe2\x80\x99s back to within 3-2 with a fifth inning solo blast, his second in as many games. J.J. Hardy led off the seventh with a double, and he was promptly doubled home by Ryan Flaherty which tied the game at three. After Joseph sacrificed Flaherty to third, Buck Showalter sent Delmon Young to pinch-hit for Gausman. A moment later, the Baltimore Orioles had an abrupt 4-3 lead when Young sent an RBI-single to center field.Later in that seventh inning the Orioles had the bases juiced after a couple of short singles. Adam Jones came to the plate and sent an RBI-single to left field and giving the Birds a 5-3 lead. An inning later Caleb Joseph came to the plate with two runners in scoring position, and he sent a two-RBI single to center field.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe O\xe2\x80\x99s of course went to the bullpen after the sixth inning since they pinch-hit for Gausman, who at that point was in line for the win. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to write about Orioles games at this point and not talk about how solid the bullpen is. Brad Brach was solid for two innings, which bridged the gap to Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day who pitched the ninth inning. He retired Washington 1-2-3, giving the Orioles a well-earned victory. Overall, the Baltimore Orioles won the Battle of the Beltways in 2014 three games to one.The \xe2\x80\x9cbeltway champions\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0now head to Toronto for an all-important three-game series. Bud Norris will take to the bump tonight for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Mark Buehrle. With Toronto idle and the Orioles winning last night, the Birds now have a solid four-game lead over Toronto in the AL East. So even if the Orioles somehow get swept, they\xe2\x80\x99re guaranteed to leave Canada in first place. Incidentally, last night\xe2\x80\x99s game also provided a victory of a different sort.

The Orioles defeated the Nationals 7-3. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAfter a series of 16 games in which the Baltimore Orioles had the good fortune to win 10 of them when only scoring 53 runs, everyone knew the O\xe2\x80\x99s bats had to come to life \xe2\x80\xa6 that the great pitching of late could not be depended upon interminably.And come to life again is exactly what the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 offense did on Monday night in Washington, led by Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s home run, single and three RBIs. The Orioles pounded out 14 total hits, with J.J. Hardy having four of them in his first 4-hit game of the season. Additionally, the Orioles went 5-for-10 with runners in scoring position \xe2\x80\x93 tallying five total runs in the seventh and eighth innings to overpower the Nationals 7-3 and take the season series 3-1.The first two Baltimore runs came on solo home runs off Tanner Roark by Nick Markakis in the fifth inning and Joseph in the third inning. For the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 catcher it was his fifth homer this year. The make-up game against the Nationals was Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s 50th of this season \xe2\x80\xa6 and his career. He is putting it together offensively and maximizing his short, quick swing. Joseph is 11-for-34 with two homers over his past 10 games.The rap on Joseph\xe2\x80\x94who was not even protected from the Rule 5 Draft over the offseason\xe2\x80\x94was that he had lots of potential offensive ability, but that his defense was terribly suspect. However, in the absence of Matt Wieters, Joseph has had his chance to play and demonstrate that his catching skills are actually at a very high level.Lagging for Joseph in Baltimore has been his hitting. But just imagine what this guy has had to absorb and produce in a short time. He has been called upon to handle the pitching staff, know the strategy of pitching against all players from other teams, while also holding their running game to first base. Along the way, he is also supposed to contribute offensively. It is a lot to put together in a short time. \xc2\xa0For perspective, Caleb Joseph and Delmon Young are the same age.But is all has to be very encouraging for the young man, who is actually \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 not that young as rookies go. He turned 28 in June. By way of reference, he is currently the same age as Delmon Young\xe2\x80\x94only nine months younger.Caleb Joseph was very discouraged last year in the minor leagues. He was age 27 and had not played higher than AA Bowie. He had success, yet at the same time, there did not seem to be a path forward for advancement. But all of that has changed with the drifting trade winds of circumstance and opportunity.In the after-game interview, Joseph said, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I can hit at this level and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t shown it yet. The more confidence you get\xe2\x80\xa6 Sometimes, hitting is all confidence and you get a little confidence and it breeds more confidence and you kind of get on a roll and then kind of get settled in.\xe2\x80\x9dAlso paying dividends for the Orioles is that Joseph had minor league experience catching and working closely with Kevin Gausman. The young O\xe2\x80\x99s pitcher did not at all have the stellar stuff as in his most recent previous outing. But he worked his way through six laborious innings\xe2\x80\x94holding the Nationals to three runs on eight hits and two walks.It was a struggle; Gausman was in trouble most of the night. But he worked through each situation by limiting the damage and holding the Orioles in the game until the offence could explode. For his efforts he gained his sixth win against three losses, aided again by the bullpen\xe2\x80\x99s 9 up / 9 down effort.The victory put the Orioles up by four full games over the Jays, whom they fly to Toronto overnight to face in the first of three on Tuesday evening.\xc2\xa0 Of the challenge this presents, Showalter said after the game, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s part of what we have to go through to get what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get done. We\xe2\x80\x99ve still got to go back to BWI to get on a plane. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough\xe2\x80\xa6 These guys get to sleep around 5 or 6.\xe2\x80\x9dThe opening game will have Mark Buehrle going against Bud Norris.Buehrle has not been pitching well of late. Though 11-7 with a 3.11 ERA on the season, he is 1-6 / 4.45 over the past 10 games, including a loss to the Orioles on June 12th.A number of the Orioles have good stats against him, including Delmon Young who is 19-for-48 with four homers, so I am looking to see him in the lineup at DH\xe2\x80\xa6 especially since Nelson Cruz is 1-for-17! Adam Jones is 10-for-28 with a homer, Chris Davis is 6-for-19 with two homer, and Nick Markakis is 20-for-46 (.435) with two homers.Budd Norris is 2-0 against the Jays in 23.2 innings, with a 2.66 ERA. Not bad.Let me suggest a lineup for tonight that drops Cruz, given his deadly slump.

Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsThe elements of success for the Baltimore Orioles baseball team are to daily provide sufficient pitching, relentless offense, and stellar defense. Putting all three of those elements together on one evening has been the challenge for the 2014 Birds. Though the defense seldom breaks down, often the hitting or pitching struggles to hold up their end of the deal.But it all came together on Tuesday even in Toronto where the Orioles opened a critical three-game series against the second place Blue Jays, scoring a 9-3 victory.Though Bud Norris was not at the top of his game, he held the Jays to two runs in 5.1 innings of work. The bullpen allowed only one additional score in their 3.2 frames. Every batter in the Orioles lineup contributed with a hit, including three home runs; and the defense bailed out the pitchers with double plays at critical moments on three occasions.Add it all together and you have a classic Baltimore Orioles type of win.The Jays scored their two runs off of Norris with a home run by Colby Rasmus \xe2\x80\x93 a rather ordinary baseball player who somehow seems to hit the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching pretty well. But the two runs were offset by solo blasts from Caleb Joseph and Jonathan Schoop on two of the prettiest swings you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever see. \xc2\xa0 Even Cruz and Davis contributed \xe2\x80\x93 that is how well this game went for the Orioles!And to summarize here with a sentence unimaginable at the beginning of the season: The Orioles had the offense cooking so well that even Nelson Cruz and Chris Davis had a pair of RBIs each \xe2\x80\xa6 both plating runs with sac flies. Chris Davis also powered a long home run, while Cruz finally caught a break with a ground single slicing through the infield.Delmon Young justified his inclusion in the cleanup spot by getting a pair of hits and two walks in his five at-bats. Also having two hits on the evening for the Orioles were Schoop, Nick Markakis, Adam Jones, and J.J. Hardy \xe2\x80\x93 who drove in the first run with a long double.All totaled, the Orioles tallied 14 hits and eight walks over the game. Even so, the Jays put up 12 hits and never went down 1-2-3 for the entire contest.The victory opens up a five-game lead over Toronto in the standings. If the Orioles could take the next two games, along with the Jays actually being six games behind in the loss column, it could put a severe beating upon the hopes of Toronto realistically being able to catch the O\xe2\x80\x99s.The pesky Yankees, who may well get Masahiro Tanaka back this season, also lost a game in the standings by dropping a 12-inning affair to the Tigers \xe2\x80\xa6 so they are six games behind.Game two of the series will have Wei-Yin Chen (12-3, 3.76) squaring off against Drew Hutchinson (7-9, 4.62).Chen has been pitching some of the best baseball that Orioles fans have seen from him over his three years in Baltimore. Hutchinson, on the other hand, is 3-6 with a 6.22 ERA over his past 10 games. However, one of those three wins was over the Orioles where he shut them out through seven full innings.

Again just to show that baseball is truly about results more than anything else and that perception can often times be off, one would tend to think that Norris was leaps and bounds better than Gausman on the previous night.Yet Gausman was credited with a quality start because he pitched longer into the game. But the only stat that really matters is that both pitchers and the team were credited with wins.The Birds left a small army on base in the first two innings, including leaving the bases loaded in the first. However just as suddenly as they appeared on the previous night in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital, we saw Oriole bats show up north of our borders. With the O\xe2\x80\x99s already leading 1-0 on a J.J. Hardy RBI-double, Caleb Joseph hit his second homer in as many nights in the fourth. That was followed by an immediate Jonathan Schoop home run, and Delmon Young would add an RBI-single later in the inning and the O\xe2\x80\x99s led 4-0.Colby Rasmus would get some runs back for Toronto with a two-run homer, just in effect to remind the Orioles that this was a pennant race. However unfortunately for them someone forgot to remind Toronto of that as well. Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x98 bat got back on track with a solo homer of his own, in the sixth Nelson Cruz singled Manny Machado home to put the Orioles ahead 6-2.Toronto did threaten to spoil the party in the seventh when they loaded the bases with nobody out. Tommy Hunter induced Jose Bautista into a sac fly-RBI, and he then pitching the Orioles into a tailor-made double-play which ended the inning. That ended up being the climactic moment of the night for the Birds, and possibly the anti-climactic moment forCourtesy of Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsToronto. It was sink or swim time \xe2\x80\x93 and the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen chose the former.Just for good measure, the Orioles loaded the bases themselves in the top of the eighth. They got that surrendered run back on Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI, however Adam Jones and Delmon Young also were both able to move into scoring position. J.J. Hardy singled both runners home, capping off the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 9-3 victory north of the border. And for the record, this was a victory in which every player in the order had a base hit, and six of the nine batters had an RBI. Top to bottom, that\xe2\x80\x99s as balanced as you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get.The O\xe2\x80\x99s also blew through five different Toronto relievers, as starter Mark Buehrle only was able to go four innings. That bodes well for the O\xe2\x80\x99s for the remaining two games this series. We also saw Andrew Miller allow a couple of base runners but ultimately get through the eighth inning. The trade for Miller might well be one of the more unsung aspects of this season.

If he could swing like that every time, he'd be back on the way to 50+ home runs. The rest of the team spent the night stinking up the joint. There's not much better of a way to put it. After the Davis home run, Hutchison retired the next 22 batters he faced, all the way through until there were two outs in the ninth inning and he walked Nick Markakis. With Hutchison at a season-high 115 pitches thrown, Jays manager John Gibbons opted for caution over the complete game, bringing on Casey Janssen for the game's final out. Hutchison entered the night with a 7.71 ERA in his home starts, a 4.62 ERA on the year in total. He was averaging fewer than six innings per start for the year, giving up three walks per nine innings. He had only turned in seven quality starts out of 22 games started. Unfortunately, three of those starts have come against the Orioles, and in throwing a near-complete game against them Wednesday, he added a fourth. It was a sad and pathetic effort as they sought to win their fourth straight game.    They needed some offense. Orioles starter Wei-Yin Chen did not have a good night on the carpet. The Rogers Centre carpet was part of the reason why, as a series of fast grounders just out of the reach of Orioles fielders led to four hits and two runs in the bottom of the first inning. The O's were down 2-0 just like that, although at least Chen managed to strike out the pesky Munenori Kawasaki with the bases loaded to hold the damage there.    That first inning was bad BABIP luck in a place that's designed for such. The second inning, well, there wasn't much bad luck about Jose Bautista launching a two-run home run halfway up into the second deck in left field. He must have gotten the right signal from the man in white for that pitch. No, not really. Well, maybe. Who knows with that shady cast of characters. Either way, it was Bautista's 22nd home run of the season. He finished off the night a triple short of the cycle. Chen ended up with a five and dive, giving up four runs on eight hits and two walks in his five innings. He struck out six, which will never win you many awards, but there are nights where it can be good enough for the team to win. Either of the last two games, it would have been good enough, in fact. Chen had the misfortune to start on the night when the Orioles hitters folded up the tents after their outburst the last two games. Chen took the loss to fall to 12-4 on the season, with Hutchison's win raising his record to 8-9.    The Jays hit 5-11 with runners in scoring position for the game. That's a good way to scratch out five runs. The Orioles never had an at-bat with a runner in scoring position all night, and did not have an at-bat with a man on base until the game's final batter. If they were facing a Cy Young-caliber pitcher, this would make sense. But Hutchison? What is this team's deal? A 0.98 ERA in four starts! He has a 5.30 ERA against the whole rest of baseball. The Orioles might be single-handedly saving Hutchison from banishment to the minor leagues. Not much to be done except show up and try to do better tomorrow. Maybe they'll hit better, maybe they'll pitch better. Maybe they'll do both. Their lead has shrunk to four games in the AL East after this loss to their closest competitor.    In Thursday's rubber game, the Orioles will send Miguel Gonzalez onto the carpet against Toronto's J.A. Happ. A win will bring them back up to a five game lead. A loss in the game and series would see the division lead shrink back down to three games. Better up by three than down by three, but even better up by five.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

With this frustrating city having slipped into another cycle of summer shootings \xe2\x80\x94 one of them ending the life of a 3-year-old girl \xe2\x80\x94 I guess we turn to baseball for communal relief from all that\'s awful, all that makes us angry and weary.Having the Orioles in first place helps.And, further, it helps to hear a pleasant fellow named Mike Cataneo tell why his father bought four season tickets to Orioles games 60 years ago, for the team\'s inaugural season here. It wasn\'t only because he wanted to schmooze with his customers. There was more to it.The elder Cataneo, known as ""Big Mike,"" certainly was a baseball fan. Three years before Baltimore joined Major League Baseball, he had taken his son to Yankee Stadium to see the great DiMaggio in his final season. And, of course, Big Mike was excited that a group of businessmen had managed to move the hapless Browns from St. Louis to Baltimore in 1954. var adSkipCounter = 0; But he also saw money spent on the Orioles as a civic investment.""I always tell people that my father had a sixth-grade education, but he had a Ph.D. in common sense,"" says Mike Cataneo, who is 75 and still a season-ticket holder. ""And he had a sense of responsibility to his city. He cared very much about Baltimore, and he thought buying the season tickets to the Orioles would be a good thing for the city.""The Cataneos had a family business, Cataneo Line Services, in Baltimore\'s busy port, and Big Mike certainly scored points with shipping agents and other customers by sharing his tickets to box seats near the Orioles dugout at Memorial Stadium.But he was a local businessman, rooted in the waterfront, and Big Mike believed baseball would be good for the regional economy and lift the community\'s spirits in spring and summer, if not always in fall.Who can say he was wrong to think that?His son is one of a rare bunch \xe2\x80\x94 holders of season tickets every year since 1954.""There are 29 accounts that have been with us for all 60 seasons,"" reports Jeff Lantz, the Orioles\' manager of media relations. And all but three will be represented Friday night when the team salutes its longtime customers during a pregame ceremony at Camden Yards. It\'s part of the Orioles\' 60th anniversary commemorations.Mike Cataneo ran the family business, later renamed Cataneo Inc., until 1993. But he\'s kept Big Mike\'s season tickets all these years, including the last 22 in Camden Yards.His favorite moments: 1958, when the All-Star Game came to Memorial Stadium and he got to see Willie Mays, among others; and 1966, when the Orioles, led by Frank Robinson and Brooks Robinson, won the World Series, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers in four games.""The biggest disappointment was 1969, when the Orioles lost the Series to the New York Mets,"" he says. ""But I was there for just about all the big events \xe2\x80\x94 Brooks\' last game, when Cal [Ripken] broke Lou Gehrig\'s [consecutive games] record. All the World Series games ... ""Of course, the Orioles have not been to the World Series since 1983. Cataneo says he never thought about letting the season tickets go even when the team suffered through 14 losing seasons. ""That never occurred to me,"" he says.Nathan Goldberg held on through the good and bad, too. At 95, he\'s among the oldest members of the 60-year club.His father, Harry A. Goldberg, was an electrical contractor who, starting in 1916 \xe2\x80\x94 and just four years after his graduation from Polytechnic Institute \xe2\x80\x94 built a business that helped Baltimoreans convert from gas light to electricity.He purchased six season tickets in 1954. ""Third and fourth rows behind the visitors\' dugout,"" says Nathan Goldberg, noting that, after some negotiations with the Orioles in 1992, his family\'s seats in Oriole Park ended up being comparable to those in Memorial Stadium in every way but in price. ""I think my father only paid about $600 for a season ticket back then.""Something comparable nowadays costs more than $4,000.Nathan Goldberg and his brother, Paul, ran the family business for five decades after World War II. Their father, Harry, died five days short of his 99th birthday in the 1980s. The family business closed in 1996. Paul Goldberg died eight years ago. But Nathan Goldberg kept the Orioles tickets in the family.His most memorable moment: same as Cataneo\'s \xe2\x80\x94 the \'66 world championship.The change that most annoys him: fans who chronically arrive two or three innings late for games.Nathan Goldberg doesn\'t get to as many games as he used to, but don\'t worry, he\'ll be on time Friday night with his wife of 73 years, Lucille. They\'ll both attend the ceremony, then watch the Orioles-Cardinals game from the same box seats they\'ve had all these years.

The Orioles say that money is critical to maintaining competitiveness and affording quality players.A judge in the New York Supreme Court Commercial Division for New York County issued a temporary restraining order Thursday in response to a Mid-Atlantic Sports Network petition to block the league decision. A hearing on a permanent injunction is scheduled this month. var adSkipCounter = 0; Judge Lawrence Marks\' order also prohibited the Nationals or the league from ""taking any action to terminate MASN\'s license."" MASN, which is controlled by the Orioles, argued that it faced irreparable harm because of a threat that the Nationals could prevent it from continuing to show Washington\'s games.The judge rejected the league\'s request to seal the record, meaning that documents filed by the Nationals and MASN will be open to the public. In documents filed with the court, MASN accused the league of botching the process used to determine television rights fees and of improperly influencing the arbitration procedure aimed at settling the clubs\' differences.There was no response Thursday from the Nationals, but Major League Baseball issued a statement noting that ""the court made no determination regarding the merits of MASN\'s and the Orioles\' claims but merely instructed the parties to maintain the status quo until a further hearing can be conducted later in the month.""We remain committed to working with both clubs to reach an amicable resolution,"" it concluded.Commissioner Bud Selig, who is retiring in January, had hoped that the fight over the MASN financial split would not be decided in court. He urged the parties to settle their differences and threatened sanctions.But the parties remain far apart. On May 30, the Nationals sent MASN a default notice contending that the club was not receiving fair-market television rights fees. The ballclub later told MASN it reserved the right to terminate the network\'s license to broadcast Nationals games.The dispute began several years ago but only proceeded to court in early July, when the clubs filed petitions that could be considered precursors to full-blown lawsuits. Marks\' order prevents the league\'s decision from taking effect until the matter can be heard by the court.MASN is contesting a June 30 decision by the owners of the New York Mets, Pittsburgh Pirates and Tampa Bay Rays. The panel, called the Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee, was selected by Selig to resolve the TV rights dispute between the Orioles and the Nationals.At the heart of the dispute is how much the Nationals should receive in television rights fees. The club received $29 million in 2011 \xe2\x80\x94 the last year for which figures were available \xe2\x80\x94 plus more than $6 million for the team\'s small but growing equity stake in MASN.The Nationals sought a television deal many times higher \xe2\x80\x94 reportedly up to $120 million \xe2\x80\x94 on par with the lucrative long-term deals that other clubs have signed in recent years.The committee\'s decision, released to the parties last month, has not been made public but would increase the TV rights fees paid to the Nationals and the Orioles. It would divert a substantial portion of MASN profits into rights fees. That would be a blow to the Orioles because 85 percent of MASN\'s profits flow to Baltimore and 15 percent to Washington, based on their ownership share of the network. Washington\'s share will climb by 1 percentage point a year up to 33 percent.In arguing against the temporary restraining order, attorneys for the Nationals noted that the MLB committee had concluded that Washington\'s fair-market rights fees should be ""tens of millions of dollars closer to the amounts advocated by MASN than the amounts the Nationals argued should be awarded.""MASN has argued that there should be no dispute over rights fees because a 2005 agreement calls for using a formula developed by Bortz Media & Sports Group, a Colorado consulting firm.The 2005 agreement with the league gave the Orioles a majority stake in the network that the team said was necessary to ensure its viability after the Nationals arrived from Montreal, taking a large swath of what was once Orioles territory.The agreement set up MASN\'s divided ownership structure and called for the rights fees to be reset at ""fair market value"" every five years to account for ratings and other considerations. The teams divide the rights fees evenly.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:The old oyster R-month rulePriest at once defended, excoriatedArundel\'s Hibbs loses scholarship to Florida State after drug arrestA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

If Selig thought he was going to scare Orioles owner Peter Angelos out of suing to get an outcome that Angelos thinks he deserves, it brings to mind a classic Bugs Bunny cartoon: ""He don\'t know me very well, do he?"" Eric Fisher of the Sports Business Journal\xc2\xa0reported on Twitter that MASN has received a temporary restraining order in New York State Supreme Court (which is not, despite its name, the highest court in New York) against the initial arbitration decision handed down by an MLB panel. That is pending the result of a hearing to be held later this month, according to Fisher. It\'s no guarantee that they will win the later hearing, but MLB would have preferred the suit to be dismissed entirely, so the fact that things are moving on is a blow to Selig. No one has ever done this before, so no one can be sure what is going to happen as a result. The genesis of the dispute lies in the favorable terms given to Angelos in creating a regional TV network as part of the agreement that he would allow the then-Montreal Expos to take up residence in Orioles territory. To offset the lost revenue from that second franchise in the territory, the Orioles were given a significant stake in the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network, declining by 1% per year until they would eventually have a 66% stake. That\'s not for another 20 years - the Orioles currently have an 86% stake in MASN.    That initial settlement, according to last week\'s Hollywood Reporter story, provided that the Nationals would have their rights fee set at ""fair market value"" in 2012. MASN - that is, the Orioles, who own most of it - has been keeping that fee lower than it should have been, according to the Nationals. They argue it\'s significantly lower, in fact:\xc2\xa0a Washington Post article from 2013 indicated that the Nationals would receive a $37 million rights fee for that year. The Nationals are seeking a rights fee in the range of $100-120 million, which could triple the amount they currently get. In the current contract, according to the Post, the Orioles are to be paid the same rights fee as the Nationals. So what\'s the problem? If the Nationals make $70 million more, so do the Orioles. That sounds pretty good. The answer to that lies in the ownership stake. If money from MASN\'s current profit has to go to paying the Nationals, that\'s less money that the O\'s get from their stake in the network. If the Orioles were getting 86% of that $70 million that could go to the Nationals, that\'s nearly $60 million per year less in the Orioles coffers. A secret MLB arbitration panel consisting of one representative each from the Rays, Pirates, and Mets had previously ruled in favor of the Nationals wanting more money, which MASN has refused to pay to this point. In the Hollywood Reporter story, a lawyer for MASN was quoted in a letter indicating the arbitration panel had a ""lack of procedural fairness"" and that it was not binding on the Orioles.    It\'s all very complicated, and now it\'s in court, which is where people get paid a lot of money to argue such complicated things. Maybe the Orioles are in the right as far as the law is concerned, in which case they will win. Maybe the Nationals are in the right, in which case the Orioles will lose. Maybe now that the Orioles have demonstrated they are willing to go to court and have won the preliminary hearing for an injunction on the arbitration award, they will secure a more favorable settlement from MLB in order to drop the pending case before the court. Selig has failed to keep the matter out of court. That\'s too bad for him. It could end up being good news for the Orioles.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

', 'www.foxsports.com'), ('Orioles-Nationals MASN Dispute: The case ... - Camden Chat', ' When MLB and the Orioles hammered out the settlement that would allow the then-Expos, owned by MLB, to move into what was previously the sole territory of the Orioles, the Orioles were explicitly given certain sweet financial perks in order to compensate for the lost revenue anticipated. One of those perks was the ability to take in the lion\'s share of the region\'s television revenues. Both parties agreed to this. Yet MLB never planned for this deal to last for long. They communicated to prospective buyers of the Nationals franchise that the television revenue would be redistributed in spite of the prior agreement with the Orioles. Major League Baseball has been planning for years to go back on this sweetheart deal now that it\'s no longer convenient for them. At least, that\'s what MASN has to say about it,\xc2\xa0charging in a petition to a New York Supreme Court that baseball engaged in a scheme that ""knowingly and intentionally deprives MASN and the Orioles of their promised compensation, assets, and rights."" This petition was filed despite the threats of baseball commissioner Bud Selig to levy the\xc2\xa0""strongest sanctions available"" should a franchise take this dispute to court. The intent of the petition is for the court to vacate a recent arbitration decision that decreed that MASN should pay between $60-90 million in additional rights fees to the Nationals per year. In essence, Selig is playing the part of Darth Vader in\xc2\xa0saying to the Orioles, ""I am altering the deal. Pray I don\'t alter it any further.""    Note that, despite what it seems like, this court case is not Orioles owner Peter Angelos suing Selig in open court. The petitioner in the case is TCR Sports Broadcasting Holding, LLP, which does business as the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. It was news to me that MASN isn\'t really MASN, too.    Of course, the Orioles - that is, the Baltimore Orioles Limited Partnership - own 85% of the network, so it\'s safe to say that MASN would not be suing the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball nor the Commissioner of Major League Baseball if O\'s majority partner Angelos did not wish it so. Still, Angelos himself isn\'t filing suit or going to court, funny as it would be to picture it. MASN is represented in the case by the New York law firm of Chadbourne & Parke LLP. They are based in the famous 30 Rockefeller Plaza building. The lead attorney on the petition is Mr. Thomas J. Hall, co-head of the firm\'s commercial litigation practice,\xc2\xa0whose biography boasts of 40 trials to verdict and arbitrations to award. Well, that sounds impressive enough.    How did things get to where MASN was filing suit against Baseball? In the original agreement between the Orioles and Baseball, the television rights fees for the nascent Nationals franchise would be set by MASN until 2012, at which time the Nationals fees would be adjusted to ""fair market value."" The Orioles would further receive the same amount of fees as whatever the Nationals would receive in any agreement. When the time came to determine that market value, MASN secured the services of the Bortz Media & Sports Group, which, according to the petition, has set the value of any disputed television contract for the last decade and a half. By their agreement, baseball\'s committee - the Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee (RSDC) - is required to use this methodology to render any rulings. In 2012, MASN proposed a $34 million rights fee, set to increase by 7.7 percent annually,\xc2\xa0according to the Washington Post. If that has continued to be the case, they would be getting about $40 million this year.    The Nationals objected to this plan, believing they were entitled to $100-120 million in rights fees. This dispute went to the RSDC, which was made up of one representative of ownership each from the Rays, Pirates, and Mets. Despite being required to use the Bortz methodology, which MASN had already consulted, the committee ruled in June, as we only found out a week ago, in favor of the Nationals. MASN\'s petition charges that the arbitration panel acted outside the scope of its authority granted in the Settlement Agreement. This is how refer to the deal that let the Nationals set up shop in Orioles territory in the first place. The Orioles agreed that the Expos could settle in their territory. Further, the petition charges that the RSDC panel was impossibly tainted by a conflict of interest. An increase in the rights fees for the Orioles and Nationals means that more money goes into the revenue sharing pool. Baseball collects 34% of local television revenues as a tax to put in the revenue sharing pool. Profits from an ownership stake in a network - which the Orioles have enjoyed explicitly as a compensation for losing sole access to their territory - are not taxed in this way. Both the Rays and Pirates are franchises who receive revenue sharing money. The petition also charges that the Chairman of the panel made statements during the hearing confirming an interest in receiving more revenue sharing money. Even beyond this, there is the argument made in the petition that Baseball had a financial stake in the outcome of the arbitration, as it had privately given the Nationals money, secured from a third party loan, in both 2012 and 2013 in advance of an expected windfall when the arbitration case was handed down. Therefore, Baseball, which convened the committee, as well as two of the three committee members, stood to benefit financially from a ruling in favor of the Nationals. The panel in essence began with an outcome pre-determined - which was disadvantageous to the Orioles - and did everything to live up to that outcome.    Or at least, that\'s what MASN argues. The New York judge who received the petition felt it had enough merit to issue a temporary restraining order against either Baseball or the Nationals doing anything to enforce the award from this arbitration panel. The Nationals had been arguing for Selig to declare the Orioles in default for payments they were supposed to make according to this biased arbitration panel. MASN wants a new arbitration hearing with an unbiased panel that will act according to the terms of the Settlement Agreement. A full hearing on the matter of an injunction will be held later in August, and if things escalate beyond that, a trial will be set for an undetermined later time. It\'s not just conjecture by MASN that the RSDC ignored the Bortz methodology. The Managing Director of Bortz stated in an affidavit that the RSDC ""improperly ignored facts and intentionally ignored other applicable reports that applied the established methodology"" - all in order to find in favor of the Nationals, which, as far as MASN/the Orioles are concerned, it had planned to do for years, going back to when MLB was selling the Nationals franchise. One way that the RSDC juked numbers to rule in the Nationals\' favor, MASN lays out in its petition, is that the RSDC considered as a baseline numbers from the 2007 season, which, as the first year of MASN\'s existence, are not representative of how it has performed in any year since and particularly not in the present. In 2007, MASN had a 5% profit margin; since, it has run on a 20% profit margin, which is, according to Bortz, the industry norm. That 20% profit margin has been applied in every single other case except for this dispute and is considered a reasonable profit. The RSDC used these 2007 numbers to justify ruling that a 5% profit margin was reasonable for MASN going forward despite the fact that it had never done so before, and was expressly bound in the Settlement Agreement to use the Bortz methodology.    By shifting money from MASN profits to the rights fees, the Orioles suffer in two ways. One, they lose the 85% of money that they would have collected from what would be shifted to the Nationals rights fees. Two, they would lose 34% of money shifted to their own rights fees as part of the revenue sharing tax. If the result of the arbitration is that both the Orioles and Nationals make $60 million more in rights fees, that\'s potentially $71 million annually that now goes to the Orioles that would be lost if this arbitration award is forced upon them. There is a further question of whether MASN could even continue to exist in its current form if it was forced to have another $120 million in expenses over what it now possesses. It seems unlikely that it could. Baseball and the Orioles made a deal when the Expos came to town. Baseball no longer likes the deal and is trying to finagle out of it. One wonders if Selig arranged things so he could buy Angelos\' cooperation for a few years, only to turn around and take him to the woodshed later. If so, he forgot who he was dealing with. Now, Angelos, through the MASN entity, has taken Baseball to court to protect the 2005 agreement. This is a man who won a multi-billion dollar settlement from tobacco companies. He\'s probably not afraid of whatever baseball can throw at him. Whether this all will go to a trial is not even a sure thing. The trial will not be under seal, which means that any documents introduced about the finances of baseball or its individual teams, would be open record. Baseball has fought very hard to avoid ever doing this, probably because then the players will see how much money the teams are hiding with sleight of hand. It could be that now that MASN is on the path to a trial, Baseball will suddenly be much more conciliatory in trying to broker a settlement, rather than trying to force them into a disadvantageous award from a biased arbitration panel. Baseball could beat MASN/the Orioles and still lose in the long run if the players are armed with more accurate information for the next round of labor negotiations.    What seems like fairness to a layperson does not always go hand in hand with what the law says. Hardball Talk\'s Craig Calcaterra, one of the many lawyer-bloggers floating around,\xc2\xa0notes how difficult it is to have a court set aside an arbitration decision, regardless of how screwed up that arbitration may have been. And the Nationals and Baseball will have their own high-powered lawyers to argue that the decision was fairly reached and, therefore, binding on MASN, who would then have to pay the Nationals a lot more money. In turn, the Orioles would in turn receive a lot less money. Of course, the whole agreement was constructed to be unfair to the Nationals to begin with, offsetting the unfairness of the Orioles losing the sole access to its own territory. Without the initial agreement being advantageous for the Orioles, Angelos would have gone to court when the Expos came to town. This agreement was the price of his silence. Little surprise that now that baseball no longer wants to kick in that money that Angelos is no longer silent about it. It\'s impossible to know what will happen next because nothing like this has ever happened before, with a team waging a court battle by proxy against another team and the league in general. Uncertainty over the outcome of this process could go a long way to explaining why the Orioles have been more cautious with payroll than outside observers think they should be. With tens of millions of dollars of annual revenue potentially going up in smoke, they simply don\'t know what they\'ll be working with in five or even two years. Until then, we wait. On the field, outside of any of these legal concerns, the 2014 Orioles have played their way to a five game lead in the American League East. The future may hold any number of problems, but for today, things are looking pretty good. The rest is up to a New York judge. This article has been edited to clarify legal terminology that was inexpertly used by this layman. Thanks to resident CCer kba26 for the explanation.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Justin Masterson may well end up contributing heavily to the St. Louis Cardinals in their bid to reach the postseason.At this point, however, the right-hander is not offering the kind of production the Cardinals envisioned when they got him from Cleveland the day before the non-waiver trade deadline.Masterson (1-1) gave up two of Baltimore\'s six home runs and didn\'t get out of the third inning in the Cardinals\' 12-2 loss Friday night.Masterson allowed five runs on seven hits. He also issued three walks, hit two batters and threw a wild pitch while getting only six outs.""This is not the best thing you want to do when you come to a new team,"" he said. ""It\'s really just a lot of minor things. It just needs to click that little bit.  A lack of location and the sinker flattening out.""The sinker never sunk, and the Orioles were all over it.""When he elevated the ball, they elevated it as well,"" manager Mike Matheny said. ""That\'s not the kind of outing Justin wants. You\'re not going to see this coming from him too often.""Masterson won his first start with St. Louis despite allowing five runs in six innings. Now he\'s got an 11.25 ERA.""He couldn\'t find the plate tonight and when he did, his pitches were more elevated than they were last time out,"" Matheny said.On a night in which the team wore 1954 throwback uniforms to mark the 60th anniversary of its arrival in Baltimore, the Orioles administered an old-fashioned whipping on the Cardinals, a franchise they shared a stadium with decades ago.J.J. Hardy hit a solo shot and a three-run drive for his 11th multihomer game. Manny Machado, Adam Jones, Chris Davis and Ryan Flaherty also connected as Baltimore (66-49) reached double figures in runs for the first time since April 24.""This is baseball. This happens,"" Matheny said. ""Sometimes it doesn\'t matter what you do. One of those nights.""Chris Tillman (9-5) gave up two runs and four hits in 6 2-3 innings. He was pulled after a two-run drive to A.J. Pierzynski made it 12-2.It was Baltimore\'s first win over the Cardinals in 11 years. The Orioles \xe2\x80\x94 who were the St. Louis Browns before relocating \xe2\x80\x94 went 1-2 in St. Louis in 2003 and were swept in three games at Camden Yards in 2011.A three-run drive by Machado and Hardy\'s first home run helped Baltimore go up 5-0 against Justin Masterson (1-1) in the third. That was enough to propel the AL East-leaders to their ninth win in 12 games.Hardy connected with two on in the fourth off Nick Greenwood for an 8-0 lead. At that point, every Orioles starter either had a hit or scored a run.Baltimore leads the majors with 144 home runs and has at least one in seven straight games. The Orioles are 55-25 when they homer.TRAINERS ROOMCardinals: Reliever Jason Motte (0-0, 4.91 ERA) was placed on the 15-day DL, retroactive to Aug. 1, with a lower back sprain. Greenwood was recalled from Triple-A Memphis.Orioles: RHP Ubaldo Jimenez (sprained right ankle) comes off the DL on Saturday for his first start since July 5. He declared himself 100 percent, saying, ""When I get on the mound I don\'t have to worry about the ankle.""ON DECKCardinals: John Lackey (1-0, 2.57 ERA) makes his second start with St. Louis on Saturday. He went 14-7 against Baltimore while with the Red Sox and Angels.Orioles: Baltimore will likely option a pitcher Saturday to make room for Jimenez on the roster. It might even be a starter, because Jimenez expanded the rotation to six.INTERLEAGUE INTRIGUECardinals: St. Louis fell to 7-11 in interleague play, and has struggled against the AL East. The Cardinals took two of three from Boston before coming to Baltimore, but they dropped three of four to Tampa Bay and two of three to the Yankees. They did, however, win two of three from Toronto.Orioles: Baltimore improved to 8-4 against NL foes.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Orioles won 12-2. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe night of August 8, 2014 will be and evening that goes down in Baltimore Orioles lore as one of the most wonderful and magical events in franchise history. A packed house at Camden Yards saw the O\xe2\x80\x99s blast six home runs on the way to a 12-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Next followed an incredible multimedia show and tribute to the 60 years of baseball in Baltimore.I am not an easily-impressed guy. For example, I drove up to Mount Rushmore a few years ago, got out of the car and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it? That\xe2\x80\x99s as big as it gets?\xe2\x80\x9d I expected somewhat WAY bigger. It was a great disappointment.In fact, much of the beauty of the West is lost on me, and I agree with the quote from the famous movie \xe2\x80\x9cDumb and Dumber\xe2\x80\x9d about the Rocky Mountains\xe2\x80\xa6Harry Dunne: I expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little rockier than this.Lloyd Christmas: I was thinking the same thing. That John Denver\xe2\x80\x99s full of crap, man.All to say, I\xe2\x80\x99m not often blown away by exceeded expectations, but the tribute show after the ballgame was absolutely incredible. The warehouse was used as a backdrop screen for projection with some phenomenally amazing graphics and video. The text for the program was perfect and the soundtrack simply awesome!Thank you, #Birdland for making our 60th Anniversary Celebration so special. #Orioles60 pic.twitter.com/5JYNcsHzRS\xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) August 9, 2014Baltimore Orioles players from the past 60 years were brought to the field one by one as memories were re-lived by many \xe2\x80\xa6 well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many remember all of them, but, I do!It all began with Milt Pappas \xe2\x80\xa6 tonight, and \xe2\x80\xa6..The day was May 2, 1964 and I was in 3rd grade. It was my first big-league ballgame and Pappas was the starting pitcher. I was amazed by the spectacle of it all, and even though the O\xe2\x80\x99s lost that game to the Indians in 13 innings, a love was born in me and I was hooked for life.Over the years, every one of those honored tonight I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen play in Baltimore, including being at the 4th and final game of the 1966 World Series, won by the Orioles 1-0 on a Frank Robinson home run. I was pretty far away by the right field foul pole to see the homer particularly well, but the seats were perfect for watching Paul Blair bring a Dodgers home run ball back into the park with a grand leap at the center-field wall.I saw Don Buford hit that opening home run in the \xe2\x80\x9969 Series and then died within when the Mets won it all.But a year later, I skipped out of my high school cross country practice after school to go to the one office in the building that had a little TV so that I could see the Orioles beat the Reds in the final game on a weekday afternoon. I got in lots of trouble with the coach, but it was worth it.So the entire show was a trip down my personal memory lane of baseball, and it has been a great ride with the Baltimore Orioles \xe2\x80\xa6 capped on this day by a magical evening.And it is a joy to come on here daily with you friends in what is for me, I presume, nearing the final innings of my personal game, and to share my thoughts and perspectives. Some days there are hundreds of you, sometimes there are a few thousand, but in any event it is a privilege that I trust gives you even a fraction of the joy it provides me in writing about it.Buck Showalter expressed his hopes earlier in the day that the team would put on a show worthy of the occasion. Check! Imagine being an Orioles player like Brad Brach or Jonathan Schoop \xe2\x80\x93 coming out on the field at the end of the celebration to mingle with the greats of the past, including multiple Hall-of-Famers. Awesome indeed!And I wondered too what it must have been like to be one of the Cardinals \xe2\x80\x93 after getting totally pasted, and then being in the locker room with the stadium shaking from the crowds, the fireworks, and the show. It might have been akin to being a Parthian warrior captured by the Romans, awaiting from within the bowels of the Coliseum for your turn with the lions in the arena.Okay \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe that was a bit over the top as a picture, but it was a great night and show in every way. I hope you all got to see it either in person or on MASN.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAs quietly as a team possibly can, the Baltimore Orioles are playing the best baseball in the Major Leagues.No, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the best record in their last 10 games, which goes to the Kansas City Royals, who are catching the Detroit Tigers. Keep this in mind, because let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget those Tigers are one of the teams the national media has deemed to be in the ALCS.No, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a major trade for a starter at the trade deadline, either to pitch or play the field. The aforementioned Tigers, Athletics, Red Sox, Braves and others made those moves.

The team has won seven series in a row, all against teams contending for the playoffs in the Cardinals, Blue Jays Nationals, Mariners, Angels, Mariners and Angels.Their last series loss was to the Oakland Athletics, and one of those losses was on a rare blown save from Zach Britton.Before that, series wins against the Yankees, Red Sox, and Rangers. 10 out of 11 series won, against teams they have struggled against in the past, or who are fighting for the playoffs.The O\xe2\x80\x99s have the largest division lead in baseball at six games. And they are doing it with a tried and true formula for success.In 2012, the Orioles won on an otherworldly statistic in close games and a negative run differential.Noticeable in their recent run, but actually true since sometime in June, the Orioles have been winning with solid starting pitching, a shutdown bullpen, and timely offense. Up until recently there were not a lot of blowout victories.This team is hard-nosed, fun to watch and has a penchant for the long ball. And for Orioles fans, if the team keeps playing like they have recently, those long balls may be headed into the stratosphere deep into October.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWhen Baltimore Orioles general manager Dan Duquette and manager Buck Showalter constructed the 2014 roster, they likely imagined the cornerstone producers \xe2\x80\x94 Adam Jones, Chris Davis, and new addition Nelson Cruz \xe2\x80\x94 would be the bats carrying them into the postseason.While that trio has certainly made its contributions, the biggest difference maker for the Orioles in the last 30 days has been the play of Caleb Joseph, Delmon Young, and David Lough.In all 94 games before the All-Star Break, Joseph, Young, and Lough hit a combined .230 with eight home runs, 31 RBI, 39 runs scored and 5 steals.In only their last 30 games, that trio is batting a combined .320 with seven home runs, 18 RBI, 15 runs scored, and two steals. Joseph, Young, and Lough are leading the Orioles in some order in batting average, OBP, and OPS during that timeframe.The production from the bottom of the lineup came while slumps by Cruz (.135), Davis (.178), and Jones (.212) threatened to cripple the club offensively.Instead, the Orioles fought through the slumps with much improved pitching and the contributions from role players, going 19-9.One of the most important qualities of good teams is finding several ways to win. Since the All-Star break, the Orioles have shown that even when their biggest bats are quiet, this team can rely on other pieces to keep it competitive.Despite today\xe2\x80\x99s 8-3 loss to the Cardinals, the Orioles remain 6 games ahead of New York and at least 5 ahead of Toronto for first place the AL East. That is the largest margin between the first and second place teams in any division in baseball. The depth that Duquette and Showalter have created has proven invaluable as pieces like Lough, Joseph, and Young have helped propel the Orioles to their 67-50 record and a probable playoff birth.

You know, the question that everyone and their brother is thinking about, but the one that nobody wants to ask for fear of a \xe2\x80\x9chigh jinx.\xe2\x80\x9d That aside, the question at hand is whether or not this is the year\xe2\x80\xa6you know what\xc2\xa0I mean. First off, five years ago asking if it was the year probably would have been asking if the O\xe2\x80\x99s might break .500. How quickly things change.To speak to the question, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you if this is the year. We won\xe2\x80\x99t know that until the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 season is over \xe2\x80\x93 whenever that is. But needless to say we\xe2\x80\x99d be remiss of we didn\xe2\x80\x99t take note of how things seem to be shaping up well for the Orioles. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not even talking about the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 season; I\xe2\x80\x99m also talking about the things that have happened around them. It seems that a lot of other contenders are having issues such as injuries right now, including Toronto, New York, and the LA Dodgers. Obviously the one team that\xe2\x80\x99s given the Orioles problems this year has been Oakland, and they seem to be just as healthy.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsHowever each time the Orioles have had a stretch of games whereby the \xe2\x80\x9cexperts\xe2\x80\x9d figured their backs would get broken, they\xe2\x80\x99ve seemingly answered the call. Granted once again that they struggled in Oakland; however they took care of business with Anaheim and Seattle twice, and have now handled Toronto and St. Louis. I would submit that St. Louis might be the best team in the National League, yet they\xe2\x80\x99ve looked like mince meat in the hands of the Baltimore Orioles.Again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say whether or not this is the year for the Orioles. But I will say that\xc2\xa0I think they have a smaller window than most teams in their position. The likes of Wieters, Davis, and others are only under team control for one more season. Obviously the O\xe2\x80\x99s will have an opportunity to re-sign all of those players, however I think everyone knows that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be tough. To shrink the window even more, Nelson Cruz is a free agent after this season \xe2\x80\x93 so\xe2\x80\xa6is the window truly this year or bust?Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s really difficult to gauge how true that might or might not be. We also don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 or Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s plans are after the season. They might have a barrel of money earmarked to keep Cruz long term for all I know. But the point here is that there is some uncertainty that surrounds this team after 2014, and potentially even more after 2015.\xc2\xa0 So if in fact the window is that small, this is a season that they should take advantage of. As I said, the cards seem to be lining up in their favor in a sense \xe2\x80\x93 at least to this point.And this is not to say that anything short of a World Series title would be a failure for this franchise. At this point I think they\xe2\x80\x99re far enough along to where if they somehow missed the post season that would be a failure, but for instance losing in the ALCS in my view would not be shameful or a failure. However one might submit that if they don\xe2\x80\x99t win a title in the current window it might take some time to get back to this level. This is not to say that they\xe2\x80\x99d go back to winning 70 games a year, but they might have to build their way back up just a bit.So with all of this said, is there anything left that the Orioles can do to try to get towards that goal? August can often be as busy as July when it comes to trades; players traded in August of course must first pass through waivers. (Trades after August 31st are even allowed, however any player traded after that date is ineligible to be on a post season roster.) Granted the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching has been about as clutch as could be of late, however it might not kill them to add another starter to the mix. Might they be able to work a deal with San Diego for Ian Kennedy? In that vain, it\xe2\x80\x99s also worth mentioning that Miguel Gonzalez will return to the Orioles after his demotion yesterday on September 1st at the latest when roster expand.So the question is whether or not this is the year \xe2\x80\x93 what do I think? Do I personally believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see a parade on Pratt Street this autumn? It\xe2\x80\x99s still too early to tell \xe2\x80\x93 far too early at that. But keep in mind that there are a lot of \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d teams out there, but starting in the middle of August is when the few \xe2\x80\x9cgreat\xe2\x80\x9d teams start to pull away. In a sense, the cream always rises to the top.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThere is so much for the fans of the Baltimore Orioles and their third baseman Manny Machado to be excited about. Most professional players his age would be working their way through the minors at about the A-level, if they were even in pro ball and out of college.He was the #3 overall pick in the 2010 draft. Though Bryce Harper was #1, the second pick (by the Pirates) was RHP Jameson Taillon, who is a career 16-21 and recovering from Tommy John surgery. And the next pick after Machado (by the Royals) was infielder Christian Colon, who has played a total of eight games in the major leagues.When have we ever seen a third baseman like this? For such a young man it is simply beyond imagination. He has the glove of Brooks Robinson, but there really is no one else with whom to compare his arm. I have never seen anything like it.He is a plus hitter, again, especially for a man his age. Machado has made such great advances this year after missing the offseason training and all of the spring up to his first appearance on May 1st. For May and June he batted .239; but for July and August it has been .348.His reflexes and eye-hand skills are simply amazing\xe2\x80\x94rare air sort of stuff. They don\xe2\x80\x99t just give away Gold Glove and Platinum Glove awards.This is a franchise cornerstone sort of player.But here is the bad news: He has ugly knees.On Monday night in Baltimore, he was essentially carried off the field with a knee injury for the second time in his short career. Of course, at the end of the 2013 season, Machado suffered a devastating knee injury on the bag at first base in Tampa Bay, resulting is major surgery.The Orioles announced Monday night that Machado suffered a sprained right knee and will be re-evaluated on Tuesday. That does not sound too bad, but the look of it at the moment it happened gave an appearance of something much worse. In a swing with a high level of torque, where it also looked like his ankle collapsed under him, he simply went down into a heap, grabbing his knee.Machado runs with a terribly awkward, knees-knocking sort of gait. Long before the first knee injury, I feared the very situation/situations that had/have developed. As a long-time running coach in cross country and track, I have to say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to offer as a suggestion for it. It is simply his natural bio-mechanical disposition. What I am really saying is that it is not a fixable sort of thing.

08/12/2014,"[('Preview: Orioles Vs. Yankees \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles have baseball\xe2\x80\x99s most homers while the New York Yankees have surrendered the most in the AL. That combination worked in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 favor to open this three-game set that may not continue Tuesday night because of a murky forecast at Camden Yards. It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear whether Baltimore will get a chance to create more distance between itself and one of its closest pursuers in the AL East with the status of two Orioles infielders also uncertain. The Orioles (68-50) pushed the third-place Yankees a season-high seven games back by winning 11-3 on Monday. Chris Davis, who replaced an injured Manny Machado, hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the fifth inning, Nelson Cruz added a two-run shot in the seventh and No. 9 hitter Jonathan Schoop delivered a three-run blast in the eighth. Baltimore now has 150 homers while New York (61-57) has surrendered 126. The Orioles have outscored the Yankees 55-28 while winning seven of 10 meetings. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s tough,\xe2\x80\x9d New York manager Joe Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know they swing the bats extremely well. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of power in their lineup.\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi emphasized that his club had to capture this series to maintain realistic hopes of winning the East. Now the Yankees would have to take the last two games \xe2\x80\x93 if they\xe2\x80\x99re played. There is reportedly a 90 percent chance of rain Tuesday night in Baltimore. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like tomorrow looks too good,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot can change in 24 hours. I have not been clued on if we do get rained tomorrow what we would do.\xe2\x80\x9d Machado sprained his right knee and limped off the field in the third inning Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll just wait for the results,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said in front of his locker, where a pair of crutches stood. \xe2\x80\x9cHopefully it is on the good side other than the bad.\xe2\x80\x9d He will have an MRI on Tuesday morning to determine the severity of the injury. Davis, batting .197 for the worst average among qualifying hitters, went 2 for 3 with his 21st homer. Shortstop J.J. Hardy, who has 11 hits in his last 23 at-bats, sat out a second straight game with a sprained left thumb. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating no matter what it is, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to play, it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the thumb or anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Hardy said. The Yankees, who remain without catcher Brian McCann due to a concussion, have totaled four runs and 15 hits during a three-game slide. New York will start rookie Shane Greene (3-1, 2.89 ERA), who threw a gem the only time he faced Baltimore by striking out a season-high nine in 7 1-3 innings in a 3-0 road victory July 12 in his second career start. The right-hander enters after another scoreless effort as he went eight innings to earn Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 victory over Detroit. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Wei-Yin Chen (12-4, 3.90), who posted a 2.53 ERA in winning five straight starts before allowing four runs over five innings Wednesday in a 5-1 loss at Toronto. The left-hander is 2-3 with a 5.76 ERA in eight starts against the Yankees. Jacoby Ellsbury is 6 for 13 against him.

Following a seemingly innocuous ground ball to shortstop, Manny Machado was curled up in the batter\'s box, clutching his right knee. What\'s worse, this was not the same knee injured less than a year ago in Tampa Bay. This time, fans of the orange and black don\'t have to guess how life would be without the 22 year old manning the hot corner. They already know the grim reality. Name: Manuel Arturo Machado Number: 13Born: July 6, 1992\xc2\xa0(22 years old) in Hialeah, FLHeight: 6\'2"" Weight: 180 lbsBats: Right Throws: RightDrafted: 1st round (3rd overall) in 2010 by the\xc2\xa0Baltimore OriolesSchool: Briot Miami Private School (Miami, FL)Contract: $519,000 salary in 2014 (Arbitration eligible, Free Agent: 2019)Walk-up song: ""Otis"" by Jay Z Personal How much can be said about Machado\'s professional baseball career? He is the most exciting and accomplished young man to don an Oriole uniform since Cal Ripken Jr. in the early 80s. He is a first round draft choice that was pegged to make All-Star games, lead a team to the playoffs and win awards. He has done all of those things in under five years of pro ball. He gives a lot of the credit to his upbringing. Machado was raised by his mother, grandmother, aunt and uncle, Gio Brito, in the inner city of Miami. He also has an older sister, Yasmine, who is about 10 years his senior. His mother, Rosa, worked two jobs and usually only spent time with Manny on Saturdays, but eventually that would be the day of the week that Manny\'s baseball games were. So, it was nice to have the other helping hands around. Uncle Gio was Manny\'s baseball coach from an early age. Every day, he would wait for Uncle Gio to get off work. When he did, the two would play catch. They did so nearly every day until Manny was old enough to be in a league.    Back in April of 2013, Brito shared a story with MLB.com\'s Brittany Ghiroli that when Manny was 9 years old he told Uncle Gio that he needed to be taken out of the game. He went and threw up to the side of the field. With no towels present, Brito told him to take his socks off to clean everything up. Then, Manny asked to be put back in the game, and he was. He played the remainder of the day with an upset stomach and no socks.    Perhaps Manny\'s biggest baseball influence was his late grandfather, Francisco Nunez.. He taught Manny to stay humble and to always work on the basics of the game. Nunez stressed the art of bunting and staying down to earth. Unfortunately, Nunez passed away on Christmas Eve, 2009 before he was able to see Manny be drafted or play in a professional game. To this day, Manny traces the letters ""FN"" in the dirt before every game. Growing up in Miami, Manny has become friends with several players who are from the same area. He has a well publicized relationship with Alex Rodriguez. As many kids born in the late 80s and early 90s did, Machado idolized A-Rod. When he was drafted, he looked to the infamous Yankee third baseman for guidance in the transition from amateur to professional athlete. However, his best baseball buddy is San Diego Padres first baseman Yonder Alonso.    The two met when Manny was an upperclassman in high school in 2009. He was being recruited by many schools; chief among them was the University of Miami (Fla.). \xc2\xa0He received a call from one of the Hurricanes stars, Alonso. It wasn\'t just a recruitment. Alonso offered Machado a friendship, asking if he needed anyone to workout or train with. After Manny was drafted, the two became tight. Manny would come over Yonder\'s house nearly every day. The two would talk baseball but also play video games and talk the way young guys do. Making the duo into a trio was Yonder\'s younger sister, Yainee. In the winter of 2011, all three of them went to Spain on a vacation. When they returned, Manny revealed to Yonder that he viewed Yainee as more than a friend and asked if it would be alright if he asked her out. In a 2013 interview with USA Today and Bob Nightengale, Yonder said that he told Manny the following:    ""As long as you respect her and be there for her, and whatever happens, just know if something happens between you guys we\'re still friends. We were friends before, and we\'ll be friends afterward,"" But that ""something"" never happened. Instead, the two fell in love and actually bought a dog together (a big sign that it\'s meant to be). It is an Alaskan Klee Kai named ""Kobe"", much to the shagrin of Manny, a Miami Heat fan. Yainee and the entire Alonso crew are Los Angeles Lakers supporters. Yainee is a former member of the Miami Marlins Mermaids cheer-leading squad and has a pre-med degree from the University of Miami. She plans to become a physician\'s assistant. The future Mr. and Mrs. Machado got engaged on February 6 of last year but, according to that same USA Today story, it was no easy task for the Orioles third baseman. They drove to South Beach to spend a night together. While there, the kitchen sink in their room broke, something caused their dinner to be delayed a few hours and the spot where Machado planned to pop the question was occupied by a snoozing homeless man. On top of that, Manny struggled to pry the ring out of his pocket and when he did, Yainee didn\'t hear him ask the question.    ""He\'s on his knees and talking, saying sweet things,"" she told USA Today. ""I didn\'t hear him propose."" Eventually she got the gist of what was going on and responded in the affirmative. The two have set their date as December 6 in Paris. Much of this article is meant to be on a lighter note and to take a look at things off the field. But the fact remains that events on the field can effect a person\'s life beyond baseball. So this is to hoping that Manny recovers swiftly and safely for his own good. Get well soon, 13.

08/13/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Shifting Sands of a Baseball Season', 'Jul 23, 2014; Anaheim, CA, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Chris Tillman (30) in the first inning of the game against the Los Angeles Angels at Angel Stadium of Anaheim. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY SportsAt the beginning of every baseball season, fans and writers who follow teams like the Baltimore Orioles ponder over who will comprise the 25-man roster for opening day. At that point, the composition of the team looks very much \xe2\x80\x9cset.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 There might be a couple of changes imagined, and everyone knows some injuries are likely to happen, but the amount of upset and change that occurs over the course of 162 games is completely outside the realm of imagination at that point.The shifting sands of the Baltimore Orioles continue all about them. It is a constant juggling act that Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette orchestrate on a daily basis to put the best possible lineup on the field when the schedule and the weather allow them to actually play.The schedule and the weather have conspired against the Orioles again, with the game yesterday being rained out and rescheduled for September. Along with the injuries to J.J. Hardy and Manny Machado, there is some more lineup shuffling going on.Cord Phelps is being brought up from Norfolk to likely join the O\xe2\x80\x99s and add some infield depth. Would you have believed me a week ago if I told you that Cord Phelps would be on the 25-man roster on August 13th?\xc2\xa0 Several other names would have come to mind before this one, so there must be a story behind this that is not generally seen.The rainout also shifts the pitching matchup. The Orioles will keep Chris Tillman on schedule while pushing back Wei-Yin Chen. This plays to the strengths of each.The Yankees have decided to not use Shane Greene, but to rather skip him and send Michael Pineda to the mound instead. He has not pitched since April, when he was found with pine tar and suspended\xe2\x80\x94during which he was injured pitching a workout.This strikes me as a desperate move on the part of the Yankees so as to not lose another game on the Orioles. They are currently seven games behind, while Toronto has fallen to 6.5 after a loss to Seattle last night.

The Orioles were totally shut down by Greene the last time they saw him. And who knows what to expect from a pitcher in his first game after an extended layoff?My guess is that Chris Davis will be at third base tonight, with Ryan Flaherty at shortstop and Yankee killer Jonathan Schoop at second. Did you ever see a happier baseball player than Schoop was after his first home run at Oriole Park? Steve Pearce will likely be picking the ball at first base.It would be a great opportunity for the Orioles to win this game and drop the Yankees far enough behind that they need to only be thinking about stealing a wildcard spot.

The Nationals own the other 15 percent, a share that rises by 1 percentage point each year and will top out at 33 percent.The New York Supreme Court for New York County granted MASN\'s request for a temporary restraining order Aug. 7, blocking the league from implementing the committee\'s decision. The court has scheduled a hearing in the case Monday.The dispute stems from a 2005 agreement brokered by Major League Baseball under which the Orioles allowed the Montreal Expos to relocate to Washington and become the Nationals, taking a piece of what had been Orioles territory. The agreement left the Orioles in control of MASN as compensation, but called for the TV-rights fee to reset every five years under a formula.Several years ago, the Nationals took issue with the rights fees \xe2\x80\x94 now about $40 million a year \xe2\x80\x94 they receive from MASN. The team requested $118 million, according to court documents. The matter ended up before a committee of three major league owners who determined that the annual fees should rise, effectively lowering MASN\'s profit margin.For months, Selig \xe2\x80\x94 who is retiring in January and whose successor is expected to be chosen at the baseball owners meeting this week in Baltimore \xe2\x80\x94 has urged the parties to resolve the dispute amicably and reserved the right to impose sanctions if they went to court.Frustrated when the teams turned to the New York court in July, Selig told the parties to attend an Aug. 6 hearing to discuss sanctions.But the Orioles challenged Selig\'s authority to sanction them in the case, balked at appearing at the hearing and threatened new litigation. The team argued that Major League Baseball\'s constitution, which says final authority for disputes between teams rests with the league, does not extend to MASN.""In light of the pending New York litigation and the possibility of further litigation if the commissioner attempts to impose sanctions, we must advise you that our clients do not intend to appear at the sanctions hearing,"" lawyers for MASN and the Orioles wrote in an Aug. 5 letter to the league\'s attorneys.Major League Baseball canceled the hearing. Selig has not indicated who might be sanctioned or what the penalties could be. Sanctions could include suspensions or fines.The Aug. 5 letter raised the possibility that Orioles majority owner Peter G. Angelos might be sanctioned.Asked Tuesday about the possibility of sanctions, Selig said: ""I don\'t want to discuss my correspondence with the clubs. They know what the rules are, and I know what the rules are. We\'re having actual constructive dialogue with both clubs.""Recent letters from Selig have asserted his jurisdiction over disputes between MASN and the Nationals. The letters were sent to Angelos and Nationals owner Theodore Lerner, according to court documents.League spokesman Patrick Courtney \xc2\xa0said Wednesday that he had no comment on the canceled sanctions hearing.Separately, MASN filed the arbitration claim seeking compensation if the league committee\'s decision is enforced, court documents show.A July 31 letter to the American Arbitration Association from an attorney for the Orioles said MASN and the club are seeking ""not less than $800 million in lost asset value"" from the league.The claim was filed with the independent arbitration association, which was designated under the 2005 agreement to settle certain disputes between the Orioles and the league.Attorneys for the Orioles and the Nationals declined to comment Wednesday, citing the pending litigation.The attorneys for MASN and the Orioles asserted in the Aug. 5 letter that their clients had a right under federal arbitration law to seek court redress. They said the league should not be able to make decisions about economic issues in which it has a stake. Major League Baseball receives a share of local TV rights fees.""Ultimately, it is our deepest hope that the commissioner will redouble his efforts to guide all parties to an amicable resolution of this unfortunate dispute,"" the attorneys wrote.jebarker@baltsun.comtwitter.com/jebarker     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:The old oyster R-month rulePriest at once defended, excoriatedArundel\'s Hibbs loses scholarship to Florida State after drug arrestA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

They used Chris Davis, a slugger who entered the day with a sub-.200 average and 139 strikeouts, in the No. 2 hole. They did not reach base against Michael Pineda until the fifth inning and looked helpless against reliever Dellin Betances.It made perfect sense, then, for Jonathan Schoop, who carried a .216 average into the game, to make a bold prediction to a teammate on the bench in the eighth inning.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to do something special here,\xe2\x80\x9d Schoop said he told Machado. \xe2\x80\x9cI might take this guy deep.\xe2\x80\x9dHe did, of course, because that is how this summer is going for the surging Orioles. That home run tied the game, and Adam Jones soon ripped a three-run shot to carry the Orioles past the fizzling Yankees, 5-3, at Camden Yards.

Remember, the Yankees won seven of eight games after the All-Star break to leave the .500 mark behind. Now they are sliding back to it.For the second year in a row, Manager Joe Girardi is getting more from his team than the numbers say he should. But the Yankees (61-58) are not catching the Orioles, and they also trail three teams for the second wild-card spot. Nothing suggests they are exceptional.On some level this must delight the 29 other owners, who are here this week to vote for a new commissioner. The outgoing Bud Selig has preached the virtues of competitive balance \xe2\x80\x94 hope and faith in every market, like a chicken in every pot \xe2\x80\x94 and the Yankees for years stood in the way of that goal. They made the playoffs every season but one from 1995 through 2012.

Tanaka is trying to avoid elbow reconstruction, still limited to easy games of catch.

Their performance has been uneven, but at least they have not had to deal with the insufferable act of Alex Rodriguez. Selig and his likely successor, Rob Manfred, sent Rodriguez away for this season as punishment for his latest drug dalliance, and the game is better for it.Alas, Steinbrenner acknowledged that Rodriguez would be back next season.

08/15/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Able Now to Beat Poorer Teams?', 'Aug 11, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles third baseman Chris Davis (19) throws over to first base to get out New York Yankees third baseman Chase Headley (not shown) in the ninth inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles defeated the Yankees 5-3. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt may seem like a silly question to ask if the Baltimore Orioles with their 69-50 record and largest divisional lead in all of baseball are able to beat the poorer teams they play. But when one digs into the numbers, you see that it is a fair question.There is no doubt that the Orioles are able to defeat the better teams. The strongest division in the American League this year has been the West. \xc2\xa0The O\xe2\x80\x99s have the best record in the league against the AL West with their 21-12 mark. By percentage, that is even better than the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s 27-20 record in their own division.As well, the Baltimore Orioles have the best record in the league against their own division, currently at 30-19 in the AL East.However, the Birds have the absolute worst record in the American League against the Central Division at 9-14. That is strange!So can the Orioles win against this mighty powerhouse division? They had better! Ten of their next 17 games will be against AL Central teams \xe2\x80\x93 three each with the Indians and White Sox, and four with the Twins. So it is not like they are playing the powerhouse Tigers or the red-hot Royals.The other seven games in this 17-game stretch feature three against the White Sox and four against the Rays. All of these teams have losing records except for the Indians \xe2\x80\x93 who are an even 60-60.Everyone was wondering how the Baltimore Orioles would fare against the three tough West Coast teams, opening the second half of the season on a long road trip versus the top three squads. After that trip and with six more at home against the Angels and Mariners, they were 10-6; and the O\xe2\x80\x99s have additionally been 7-2 since then \xe2\x80\xa6 all of this adding up to 17-8 since the break. If a team could sustain that pace for a whole season, it would equal a record of 110-52. Yes, the Orioles have been playing good baseball.It would seem that everything is aligned for the Orioles to run away with the divisional title by beating up on poorer teams and expanding their current 7.5-game lead over the Jays and 8-game margin on the Yankees. But this has been an upside-down year in every way, and easy and expected things are not what has happened.

Just two months ago on June 16th, the Baltimore Orioles were 35-34 and five games out of first place. Since then, over a period of 50 games, they have been 34-16 \xe2\x80\xa6 yep, that is 17-8 over two consecutive 25-game stretches both before and after the break.So, who else has as much of a \xe2\x80\x9cteam of destiny\xe2\x80\x9d look about them right now? Maybe the A\xe2\x80\x99s? Any other? Not really. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Preview: Orioles At Indians \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' By TOM CASTRO STATS Senior Editor (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles are pulling away in the AL East, but extending their winning ways Friday night could be a tall order against Cleveland Indians ace Corey Kluber, the hottest starting pitcher in baseball. Wei-Yin Chen had also been on an impressive roll before his latest outing, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get back on track and deliver a third straight win for hot-hitting Baltimore as it opens a three-game series in Cleveland. The Orioles (69-50) finished a two-game sweep of their rain-shortened set against the New York Yankees on Wednesday, rallying for a 5-3 victory as Jonathan Schoop and Adam Jones homered in a four-run eighth inning. Offense has been the key of late for Baltimore, which has scored seven or more runs five times in the past nine games and reached double figures in three of those. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we\xe2\x80\x99re down by one we always feel we\xe2\x80\x99re just one pitch away,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said. The Orioles, 7 1/2 games up in the division, haven\xe2\x80\x99t lost two in a row since June 28 and 29, going 27-11 in that span. Baltimore leads the majors with 152 home runs, is 35-10 when hitting more than one and 58-25 when going deep at least once. Making Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s win all the more impressive was the fact that the club played without infielders Manny Machado \xe2\x80\x93 placed on the disabled list with a sprained knee prior to the game \xe2\x80\x93 and J.J. Hardy, leaving the lineup with a final five of Delmon Young, Steve Pearce, Ryan Flaherty, Schoop and Nick Hundley. Hardy hopes to return in this series and his team could use him against Kluber (13-6, 2.46 ERA), who\xe2\x80\x99s had little trouble shutting down every lineup he\xe2\x80\x99s faced over the past three weeks and rarely gives up home runs. The right-hander has allowed one earned run in his last 31 1-3 innings. He won his third straight start and sixth in seven outings Saturday, throwing six innings of four-hit ball in a 3-0 road win over the Yankees. He struck out 10 for the fourth time in seven starts. \xe2\x80\x9cJust stick with my same approach. Maybe just executing a little better,\xe2\x80\x9d Kluber said of his recent success. Kluber has given up 10 homers in 171 2-3 innings and none in his previous five starts. He has faced Baltimore twice, most recently pitching seven innings and striking out nine in a 9-0 road win May 24. Chen (12-4, 3.90) had also been on a roll prior to his last start, coming into it having won a career-best five straight with a 2.53 ERA.

The Indians (60-60), though, still haven\xe2\x80\x99t established any extended consistency after their three-game winning streak ended in a 1-0, 12-inning home loss to Arizona on Wednesday. They are five games out of the second wild-card spot and need to pass three teams to reach it. The club\xe2\x80\x99s offense will get a needed boost Friday with the return of outfielder Michael Bourn, who\xe2\x80\x99s been on the DL since June 6 with a hamstring injury. Nelson Cruz is 3 for 9 with two doubles and a homer off Kluber, while Michael Brantley \xe2\x80\x93 batting .412 in his last 13 games \xe2\x80\x93 has gone 3 for 5 with a triple and a double against Chen.

After bruising negotiations and the threat of litigation by the Baltimore team, baseball reached an agreement with the Orioles giving the club control of the regional television network it shares with the Nationals as compensation for the loss of territory.While the deal was supposed to settle the matter, the Nationals bridled under the agreement and now seek to level the economic field by demanding more in television rights fees from the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. As attorneys head to court Monday for an important hearing in the brewing case, the Orioles\' demeanor in court documents resembles that of an unapologetic whistle-blower. The attorneys use words like ""corrupted,"" ""fraud"" and ""bias"" to describe the baseball procedures it is challenging. var adSkipCounter = 0; Lawyers for MASN argued in a New York court memorandum filed Wednesday that the process baseball employed to try to resolve the television dispute contained ""pervasive conflicts of interest, intolerable self-dealing, and fraud.""Because the court declined Major League Baseball\'s request to seal the record, all of the charges and countercharges are available publicly.""In general, the league and the teams despise having their differences aired in open court,"" said Rich Brand, an attorney and media rights expert who chairs the sports practice group at the firm Arent Fox. ""No league would be happy about this stuff.""At issue is a June 30 decision of three club owners arbitrating the rights fee disagreement between the Nationals and MASN, which broadcasts both the Orioles\' and Washington\'s games. The Orioles hold a majority stake in MASN, which says the decision would force it to distribute excessive rights fees to the Nationals, decimating the network\'s profit margin. That would leave the Orioles with less money as well.Rights fees can pay for player salaries, provide funds for new facilities and, generally, be the difference, Brand said, ""between a team doing very well or not so well.""In documents, the Nationals counter that the Orioles continue to benefit from the ""immensely favorable terms"" of the 2005 settlement agreement.The Orioles own 85 percent of MASN, while the Nationals own 15 percent, a stake that is growing by a percentage point each year until it tops out at 33 percent. As a result, most MASN profits flow to the Orioles.The Nationals, who receive about $40 million a year in annual rights fees, requested an increase to $118 million that they said represented fair market value, according to court documents. The arbitration panel would boost the fee \xe2\x80\x94 which is the same for both clubs \xe2\x80\x94 to about $60 million, court documents show.Attorneys for MASN and the Orioles seem to be not only challenging the decision but also the authority of retiring Commissioner Bud Selig, who says the dispute should have remained internal.""The MLB constitution says the owners put their trust in the commissioner and agree he is the person who has final authority to resolve any dispute among the owners,"" said Stephen F. Ross, a Pennsylvania State University professor who specializes in sports law. ""The commissioner could say, \'[Orioles owner] Peter Angelos, you are not acting in the best interests of baseball and I\'m going to suspend you.\' ""MASN argues that it has the right under federal arbitration law and the 2005 agreement to seek recourse outside the commissioner\'s office.According to court records, Selig sought to convene an Aug. 6 hearing on possible sanctions, but lawyers for the Orioles and MASN said they would not attend, and the hearing was canceled.The commissioner has said he is focused on reaching an amicable settlement. Selig and his aides have declined comment while the matter is litigated.The case is unfolding in the New York Supreme Court for New York County, which issued a temporary restraining order Aug. 7, blocking baseball from imposing its decision and the Nationals from withdrawing TV rights from MASN. At Monday\'s hearing, the court will hear arguments on whether to make the injunction permanent.Meanwhile, MASN filed an arbitration claim against Major League Baseball with the American Arbitration Association, seeking at least $800 million in damages for breach of contract if baseball\'s decision is enforced.The Orioles argue in the arbitration claim that baseball did not use the proper methodology in determining the rights fee, according to documents filed in the New York court. The correct standard, the club\'s lawyers say, is a formula developed by Bortz Media & Sports Group, a Colorado consulting firm.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:The old oyster R-month rulePriest at once defended, excoriatedArundel\'s Hibbs loses scholarship to Florida State after drug arrestA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWith their win last night the Orioles are now 7.5 games up on the second place Blue Jays, which is the largest lead of any division leader in all of baseball. With only 43 games remaining in the season the division title seems almost evitable. They also improved their record to 69-50 which is currently the third best record in baseball. However, despite their success there are still a number of skeptics around baseball.For most of the season the majority of MLB analysts have been quick to brand the Orioles as a powerful offensive team whose biggest weakness remains their starting pitching. However, for those who have followed the Orioles closely this season that simply hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the case. It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that with their lineup the Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to struggle to score runs, but it\xe2\x80\x99s their starting pitching that has been the key to their recent surge.The first example of this would have to be opening day starter and assumed staff ace Chris Tillman. With another strong start last night Tillman has now allowed three runs or less in 13 straight starts. In his last ten starts he has an ERA of 2.60 and has an ERA of 1.74 in three starts in August. It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to note his last eight starts have come against teams with winning records.The two most consistent starters have been Bud Norris and Wei-Yin Chen. Norris has had a sub-4.00 ERA in every month since April, at 10-7, he has been the quality starter at back of the end of the rotation the Orioles have been missing in recent years. With 12 wins Chen has gotten his share of run support this season. However, he has also pitched well enough to deserve his good fortune. He has allowed 3 runs or less in eight of his last ten games.Despite being sent to AAA last week Miguel Gonzalez may have been having one of the best seasons of all the starters. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed more than four runs since his first start of the season and has failed to go five innings only twice. He also seemed to be heating up for the stretch run with an ERA of 1.82 in July.The two wild cards in the rotation are Kevin Gausman and Ubaldo Jimenez. Gausman has the best stuff on the team and has shown flashes greatness since he broke into the rotation going 6-4 with a respectable 3.90 ERA. If he could polish his talent into being a more consistent starter he could be the most important pitcher in the playoffs.Ubaldo Jimenez has been a really expensive frustration so far for the Orioles. However, he did have the second-best ERA in the second half of last season. While that can give the Orioles some hope he can turn the season around, if he can\xe2\x80\x99t the Orioles have enough options to be successful without him in the rotation.Several of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters began the season slowly, but mid-way through August the Orioles now have five starters with ERAs under 4.00. It\xe2\x80\x99s true names like Gonzalez, Chen and Norris don\xe2\x80\x99t carry the star-power of the Tiger\xe2\x80\x99s Price, Verlander or Scherzer, and that could be partially responsible for the national media\xe2\x80\x99s skepticism. However, anyone watching the Orioles closely this season realizes the Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t winning games in spite of their starting pitching. In fact, of late it might be their biggest strength.

Orioles starter Ubaldo Jimenez offers a close replica, though. The Orioles had not lost back-to-back games since June 28-29. After a tough loss on Friday night, the O's had Ubaldo pitching in Saturday's game. The story of the end of that streak practically writes itself, and that's exactly what it did. Ubaldo bumbled his way through the game until he was mercifully lifted, but by then the Orioles were in a 6-0 hole that held up as the game's final score. At no point in the game did you have any reason to feel good about Jimenez. This happens all too often with the Orioles' marquee addition from this past offseason. He went ahead and walked the first two batters he faced in the game, because he's Ubaldo and that's what he does. That was followed with a one out, three-run home run by Carlos Santana, putting the Orioles in an early hole from which they never had a chance to emerge. Orioles hitters were kind enough to prevent Jimenez from having a monopoly on causing Orioles fan misery. They were lost the entire night, mustering only four hits across the game's nine innings, never drawing a walk. That came against seven innings of Cleveland's Carlos Carrasco, who is no one who ought to be shutting out the Orioles, and therefore the most likely pitcher to shut out the Orioles. It was an ugly performance. The O's sent the minimum three batters to the plate in seven of the game's nine innings. They never had multiple base hits in the same inning. There was absolutely nothing positive to hang your hat on about their performance. They went 0-4 in their few opportunities with runners in scoring position. They had 1-2-3 innings every inning from the fourth through the eighth.    Jimenez also continued to be ugly. He may have tricked a few people by settling down for three innings after a disastrous first, but he went right back to a nuclear reactor meltdown in the fifth inning, giving up another three runs, including a two-run home run to Michael Brantley, his 18th of the year. Brantley's actually having himself a good season, so it's not like serving up the walkoff dinger to, say, Mike Aviles. Jimenez gave no reason to be charitable towards him, though.    In bombing his way towards his ninth loss of the season, Jimenez lasted only 4.1 innings, giving up six runs on five hits and three walks, while striking out five. He allowed the two home runs. Carrasco, on the other hand, pitched seven strong innings of three-hit ball, improving his record to 5-4. Carrasco was a big part of the reason why O's batters had a .133 average on the night. T.J. McFarland, Brad Brach, and Tommy Hunter were the garbage time trio who closed out the game for the O's with no further damage allowed.    Nick Markakis had two of the Orioles' four hits, including a leadoff single in the top of the first. Unfortunately, no one else brought their bats to the field. All his first inning hit did for him was put him on base when Adam Jones grounded into an inning-ending double play. The Orioles will try to stave off the sweep in a scheduled 1:05 game on Sunday afternoon. Kevin Gausman is tasked with arresting the slide as the O's starter. He'll be opposed by Cleveland's Danny Salazar, who sports a 4.88 ERA and is therefore a prime candidate to hang another shutout on the Orioles.

Sometimes it does.It seems to me that this experiment has run its course for this year. The Orioles have five starters who are better than serviceable. Yes, it is sad that the O\xe2\x80\x99s spent so much money on this guy and did not get what they paid for.

This vehicle cost me more than any in my lifetime, and now that I have had it for a few weeks I discover that I don\xe2\x80\x99t really like it. It is nothing like I expected. There were features listed on the sticker that do not actually exist. The car was in the shop this week for an alignment (and other issues), and it comes back only slightly repaired. So I have decided today to name my car \xe2\x80\x9cUbaldo\xe2\x80\x9d because it was very expensive and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really work correctly.At some point I\xe2\x80\x99m going to need to cut my losses, just as the Baltimore Orioles are going to need to determine how to deal with their bad investment. Perhaps \xe2\x80\x9cFresh Eyes\xe2\x80\x9d can concentrate over the offseason on getting things aligned and tweaked, hoping the investment pays off another year. It is too risky right now to depend upon Jimenez.It is difficult to win a divisional title and have realistic hopes of going beyond when you have on your roster the #1 pitcher in walks in the league, as well as the #1 hitter with strikeouts.I saw on a comment board where someone wrote of Jimenez that he should be named \xe2\x80\x9cA-box-o Chocolates\xe2\x80\x9d because you never know what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterTo be fair, it would not have mattered if Jimenez pitched a perfect game, as the best he could have hoped for was a tie.

The O's hitters finally broke out in Cleveland as they tried to stave off a sweep at the hands of the Indians. On Sunday afternoon, the Orioles notched more hits (12) than they did in the rest of the series combined in a 4-1 win over their hosts. A day after their first back-to-back losses since late June, the Orioles came out looking to avoid their first sweep since late May. Tasked with holding the line was Kevin Gausman, who responded to this challenge by walking two of the game's first three batters. Oh no! Here we go again. Except it was okay, because Cleveland was kind enough to bat an Izturisian infielder second in the form of Jose Ramirez, who bunted to give up an out. Gausman escaped the jam, despite a double steal, after a foul popup and an easy groundout. Initially, the offense did not do a whole lot to help their cause. They came into the game having not scored a run since the eighth inning on Friday night. They blew their first promising scoring chance. Chris Davis, dumped down to seventh in the order, led off the third inning with a double off the left field wall. An awful throw in from left by Michael Brantley allowed Davis to get away with a belly flop slide. The Orioles' luck quickly turned, as Nick Hundley scorched a liner that was caught after a leap by second baseman Jason Kipnis. Davis was doubled off. You couldn't even get mad about it. Despite Jonathan Schoop getting to second on a two-base error and a Nick Markakis walk, the Orioles could not add to the two-out rally to score in the inning.    The Indians got on the scoreboard first in the fourth inning, taking advantage of the fact that Delmon Young was manning left field to start the game. Carlos Santana hit the kind of double that's only a double when hit in Young's direction. One batter later, Kipnis dropped a single in front of a charging Adam Jones. Cleveland's third base coach aggressively sent Santana, which paid off after a wide throw from Jones couldn't be handled by catcher Nick Hundley.    That put the Indians on the board 1-0. They would get no runs, or even any hits, for the whole rest of the game. The Orioles broke out of their scoreless streak in the sixth inning. Steve Pearce led off the inning with a double crushed to center. Jones was hit by a pitch, putting two men on with none out. That was enough for Indians manager Terry Francona to pull his starter, Danny Salazar, in favor of the graybeard Scott Atchison. The next two Orioles batters made outs. With two outs, J.J. Hardy had two strikes on him. Here's where they were about to blow it, only they didn't: Hardy drove an outside fastball into right, getting the O's even on the scoreboard at 1-1.    They were not done yet. Davis muscled a double down the left field line, scoring Jones easily, although Hardy had to stop at third even though there were two outs and the ball went deep into the left field corner. Well, whatever. The run didn't matter. The Orioles' 2-1 lead was all they would need to win the game. After his offense got him the lead, Gausman sent them down 1-2-3 in the sixth inning. He was pulled after that with 91 pitches thrown. It was not a great outing for Gausman, who also walked a pair of batters in the fifth inning, but he bailed himself out by fielding a comebacker for an inning-ending double play. Across his six innings, he gave up only a run on two hits, but he also walked four and struck out only two. Winning without your best stuff is part of pitching. Following Gausman's departure, the Indians did not get another base runner until the ninth inning, when closer Zach Britton issued a one-out walk before getting a game-ending 4-6-3 double play from Kipnis. Darren O'Day and Andrew Miller each also pitched a scoreless inning out of the Orioles bullpen. Miller struck out all three Indians he faced. That's pretty good, right?    After Salazar's departure, Francona employed a parade of relievers for no discernible reason. He used six pitchers over the game's final four innings. Two of them ran into problems, by which I mean homers. Pearce crushed a pitch from Chen-Chang Lee to the gate beyond the left field fence in the seventh inning, his 12th of the season. The next inning, Jonathan Schoop victimized reliever Kyle Crockett, unleashing a display of raw strength as he drove a ball over the fence in deep center. That was also Schoop's 12th homer, and it set up the game's 4-1 final score. Five Orioles had multi-hit games: Pearce, Jones, Hardy, Davis, and Schoop. For being on the mound at the right time, Gausman was given the win, raising his record to 7-4. For his reliever allowing inherited runners to score, Salazar took the loss, dropping to 4-6 on the year. Britton's save was his 26th. Elsewhere in the division, the Yankees beat the Rays, 4-2, while the Blue Jays fell to the White Sox, 7-5. That leaves the Orioles with a seven-game lead over second-place New York, and 7.5 games up on Toronto. The O's still hold the largest division lead in MLB.    The road trip moves on into the Central time zone as the Orioles will spend the week in Chicago. First up are the White Sox on Monday night for a scheduled 8:10 start. Bud Norris will take the mound for the Orioles, while the O's hitters will be up against ace Chris Sale. Sounds like a real even matchup. The Orioles don't face a team that currently has a winning record again until September 12. They ran the gauntlet without getting tripped up. Now it's time to do the cakewalk without getting eaten by all the cake.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles, Ubaldo Jimenez struggle in Cleveland', 'It\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly difficult to put one\xe2\x80\x99s finger on why there are some games in which teams struggle to score runs, and then in others they come in bunches. Many people callously say that the Baltimore Orioles can only score when they\xe2\x80\x99re hitting the ball out of the ballpark. That might partially be true, however I would also submit that it\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat overstated. One thing is certain however, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the fact that you can\xe2\x80\x99t win if you don\xe2\x80\x99t put any runs on the board\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and your starting pitching struggling certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help. Ubaldo Jimenez was roughly welcomed back to Progressive Field by Cleveland hitters who seemed to know what he was throwing before he did. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.1 IP, 5 H, 3 BB, 5 K. Jimenez opened the game by walking the first two batters, the second of which came on a full count. And that right there set the tone for the game given the fact that Jimenez threw 33 pitches in the first inning.Caleb Joseph also got crossed up with one down and two on in the first, which allowed both runners to move into scoring position. Carlos Santana sat on a fastball on 2-2, which is exactly what he got \xe2\x80\x93 and suddenly Cleveland had a 3-0 lead. And perhaps Jimenez and the Orioles allowed Cleveland to think backwards there a bit too much. A count like 2-2 will\xc2\xa0generally dictate that a fastball is coming. However with first base open, Jimenez didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have to throw a fastball. While you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to load the bases if you can avoid it, the idea is to stay out of the big inning. (So if you load the bases you might have a possible double-play to end the inning.) Instead Santana hedged his bets that Jimenez would throw a fastball, and he was right.In fairness to Jimenez, he did settle down after that first inning. In fact for awhile it seemed like all the Orioles had to do was put a fewCourtesy of David Richard-USA TODAY Sportsruns on the board and they\xe2\x80\x99d have a fighting chance. The O\xe2\x80\x99s once again put up some poor numbers with runners in scoring position (0-for-4), however the fact is that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to get any runners in scoring position nary a few times. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it easy to win games, and while Ubaldo Jimenez had his struggles it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have really mattered anyways.Cleveland added a Ramirez RBI-single in the fifth, along with a Jeff Brantley two-run homer to run the final score to 6-0. The one silver lining once again was the bullpen, which combined throw 3.2 innings giving up only three hits (spread over three relievers).  In assessing Jimenez after the game Buck Showalter said that if Jimenez was going to be removed from the rotation, he (meaning Jimenez) would be the first to know, and that word would come from Showalter. Showalter also alluded to the fact that Miguel Gonzalez would be available to make the start in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game against the ChiSox in Chicago, which is interesting. That would mean someone would have to come out of the rotation, either \xc2\xa0going to the DL, a trade, or someone being sent down. I do think it might be possible that the Orioles have a deal of sorts in the works for a starting pitcher. While I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it does seem reasonable that something might be in play if they\xe2\x80\x99re looking at Gonzalez re-joining the team. It\xe2\x80\x99s also worth mentioning that if a player (most probably a reliever) is optioned on Wednesday, they\xe2\x80\x99d end up staying in the minors the necessary ten days before being eligible to come back up in September when rosters expand.So if I\xe2\x80\x99m off base and there\xe2\x80\x99s no trade in the works, I could see someone like McFarland or even Brad Brach being sent down for a period, and Jimenez going to the bullpen. But time will tell. Quite a few fans tweeted me last night during the game suggesting that the Orioles should send Jimenez to the minor leagues. First off let me say that I understand the sentiment. However let me be clear; if they did that, Jimenez would have to clear waivers. That means that any other team would have the option of claiming him, While many people\xe2\x80\x99s response to that is\xc2\xa0would that be such a bad thing?, what fans should know is that Jimenez would then be that team\xe2\x80\x99s property and he\xe2\x80\x99d still be on the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 payroll for the final three years of his contract.That would be an incredibly poor decision from a business standpoint for the Orioles. So if the team appears stubborn in terms of not wanting to send Jimenez to the minors, that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why.The Orioles will try to salvage one game this afternoon in Cleveland, with Kevin Gausman getting the start for the Birds. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s Danny Salazar, who\xe2\x80\x99s never faced the Orioles. While pitchers that have never faced them have been able to shut them down in the past, you have to hope that the bats wake up a bit starting this afternoon. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

He's kept the O's within striking distance, but if you add up three of his last four starts, he's surrendered nine runs over just 15.1 IP. On the plus side, he had that gem of seven scoreless innings against the Angels on July 31, and despite being unable to get deep into games, he's struck out 21 over 22.1 IP in his last four. Despite losing about a month in April/May to an elbow strain, Sale is continuing a great season, striking out 30% of batters he faces and walking under 5%. The O's managed two runs over six innings against him in late June (and eventually won that game on Chris Davis's dramatic pinch-hit homer). Sale throws fastballs roughly half of the time to batters of both handedness, about 40% four-seamers to 12% two-seamers. Against fellow lefties, Sale throws his slider most of the rest of the time once he gets ahead in the count, and he'll occasionally use his changeup when behind. Versus righties, the changeup is his main secondary offering, and he'll use it in any count, while using the slider sparingly. Tuesday, August 19, 8:10 ET: Chris Tillman @ Jose Quintana      Tillman Quintana   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 206.1 156.2 200.0 154.2   ERA 3.71 3.68 3.51 3.14   FIP 4.42 4.21 3.82 2.88   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .241/.303/.427 .240/.304/.380 .247/.300/.395 .246/.299/.337         Tillman's pitched quite well of late, with just one non-quality start in his last eight games. In his last three outings, he's given up just four runs over 20.2 IP. He's also walked two or fewer batters in each of his last six starts, and one or fewer in five of those.    Quintana went on quite a roll from mid-June through July, giving the White Sox better-than-minimum quality starts in seven of eight outings. That stretch included a seven-inning, one-run, eight-strikeout performance at Camden Yards on June 24. Quintana's last few starts haven't been quite as good, but he seems to have been victimized by unfortunate sequencing (four runs in 6.2 IP against the Giants despite allowing only six baserunners) and poor defense (five runs, two earned over 10.2 IP against the Mariners and Twins). Quintana uses fastballs for about 60% of his pitches to both right- and left-handed hitters, and even more often when he gets behind in the count. Against fellow lefties, he goes to his curveball the rest of the time, while against righties, he throws his curve and changeup in equal numbers. Wednesday, August 20, 8:10 ET: Wei-Yin Chen @ Hector Noesi      Chen Noesi   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 137.0 136.1 27.1 126.1   ERA 4.07 3.76 6.59 4.84   FIP 4.04 4.14 4.36 4.69   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .272/.321/.440 .272/.305/.446 .353/.414/.521 .272/.334/.432         Chen's had a solid run of late, managing seven-plus innings and one or fewer runs in three of his last four games. He's just two outs from reaching the innings mark he set last season, making now an interesting time to compare his peripherals. Chen's strikeout rate is essentially the same (2013: 18.2%; 2014: 18.0%), but his walk rate is greatly reduced (6.8% -> 4.2%). He's also managed to increase his groundball percentage (34.4% -> 41.1%), so while he's surrendering more home runs when the ball gets into the air (9.9% -> 12.9%), he may be getting unlucky in that regard this season (3.66 xFIP). Noesi has already played for three different teams this year, beginning the season as a Mariner before spending ten days in the Rangers organization and finally being claimed by Chicago in late April. The White Sox are the only team that's used him as a starter in 2014, and he's settled down into an acceptable back-end rotation piece. He's pretty inconsistent, having put together three quality starts in a row only once this season, but he did hold the O's to two runs over seven innings in late June. Noesi throws fastballs about 60% of the time, mostly four-seamers, though he does occasionally add some sink or cut. His main offspeed offering is a changeup, and lefties will see some curveballs as well, while fellow righties get nearly as many changeups but sliders rather than curves.

Scenarios are possibly the most confusing concept in sports, solely because there are just way too many of them.This year is no exception when it comes to the American League playoff run. Teams aren\xe2\x80\x99t sure whether they want the third seed, the second seed, or the first seed. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll play a better team if we get the number one seed, maybe not.\xe2\x80\x9dThis thought is what is running through the mind of the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 organization right now. With the Oakland Athletics and Los Angeles Angels currently tied atop the American League, the Orioles trail both teams by just two games at 70-52. The O\xe2\x80\x99s could make a legitimate run at the number one seed, but the question becomes; do they really want to? I\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure if they do.The reason is very simple yet very confusing. If the Orioles were to snatch the number one seed in the AL, then they would have to face the winner of the first-round wild card matchup. As it stands today, that matchup could very well involve the Detroit Tigers and the Oakland Athletics (the Tigers are just a half-game back of the second wild card). If the season were to end today, and the Os finished with the number two seed, then they would face the Kansas City Royals.

Call to the PenHowever, the one hole in this is that the Tigers are only 1.5 games back of the Royals for the American League Central Division lead and the Royals are on a crazy hot streak. They have won 20 out of their last 25 games and just had their nine-game winning streak snapped a couple of days ago. They are bound to go on a losing streak and I find it hard to believe that the Tigers won\xe2\x80\x99t win this division. However, the current standings would beg to differ.Confused yet? Good, because I\xe2\x80\x99m just getting started.If the Tigers were to regain the division lead, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean that the O\xe2\x80\x99s would want the number one seed, and here\xe2\x80\x99s why: If that previous scenario were to occur, then the wild card matchup would feature the Royals and either the A\xe2\x80\x99s or the Angels. What are the odds of the Royals beating one of those teams? Not very good. If the O\xe2\x80\x99s were to get the number one seed and the Tigers were to win the AL Central division, then the O\xe2\x80\x99s would be relying on the Kansas City Royals, a team that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been to the postseason since 1985 (the 28-year playoff drought is the longest current drought in baseball) to beat one of the best teams in baseball.The Seattle Mariners, however, might be mad at this article so far because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t mentioned their name once. They are currently a half-game up on the Detroit Tigers for the number two wild card in the American League. However, to not make things more confusing for you, let\xe2\x80\x99s just assume that the Mariners are the same as the Royals in that they both have long playoff drought (although the Royals drought is way longer).To clear things up a bit, here are the American League wild-card standings:AMERICANWLPCTGBHOMEROADRSRADIFFSTRKL10LA Angels*7250.590\xe2\x80\x9341-2331-27574487+87Lost 15-5Oakland*7351.589\xe2\x80\x9340-2133-30597436+161Lost 53-7Seattle6756.545\xe2\x80\x9334-3233-24490391+99Won 18-2Detroit6656.541.533-2933-27556522+34Lost 14-6NY Yankees6359.5163.529-2934-30481518-37Won 25-5Toronto6461.512433-2631-35558549+9Lost 13-7Cleveland6261.504537-2425-37534521+13Lost 15-5Tampa Bay6163.4926.528-3433-29492469+23Lost 26-4Chicago Sox5965.4768.531-2928-36532587-55Won 14-6Boston5667.4551129-3327-34475531-56Lost 16-4Minnesota5567.45111.526-3229-35515556-41Lost 14-6Houston5273.4161629-3623-37501592-91Won 15-5Texas4876.38719.523-3825-38494629-135Won 13-7In a nutshell (I know you guys are relieved to hear those words), the Orioles would love if the season ended today because then they would face the Kansas City Royals in the ALDS with home-field advantage. Who would have thought that this would have been a possibility before the season?However, right now the Orioles should only have one focus in mind, and that\xe2\x80\x99s winning the division.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles-Nationals MASN Dispute: Judge issues \\u2026', "" After a Monday hearing in a New York court over the dispute over MASN rights fees, the judge issued an injunction preventing baseball from taking any action to compel MASN to pay the Nationals additional rights fees. That injunction will be in place pending a full trial in the case. This is still not a permanent victory for the Orioles, who would stand to lose tens of millions of dollars in yearly revenue if the MLB arbitration is forced upon them. However, it is unambiguously a victory for the O's and a defeat for the Nationals. The Baltimore Sun's Jeff Barker was in New York to report on the hearing and ruling:  Judge: MASN successfully raised question of whether MLB arbitrators were truly neutral in deciding TV rights fees for Nationals\r \xe2\x80\x94 Jeff Barker (@sunjeffbarker) August 18, 2014        MASN argued that\xc2\xa0the panel was not neutral in three ways. First, two of the members of the panel - the Rays and Pirates - would stand to gain financially from the arbitration's ruling. Second, the firm representing the Nationals, Proskauer Rose, had represented MLB and all three clubs on the arbitration panel in the past. Third, MLB itself, under whose auspices the arbitration took place, had a direct financial stake in the proceedings, given that it loaned the Nationals at least $25 million that was potentially expected to be paid back by anticipated extra rights fees.    The Nationals had been attempting to force MASN to pay $15 million immediately, with another $5 million by September 1. They were also seeking to terminate MASN's license to broadcast Nationals games. The judge has barred the Nationals from taking any such action while the TV rights fee dispute is resolved in court. With the case now going to trial without MLB having the ability to force MASN to pay money, the leverage in the case may have swung into the Orioles corner for one key reason: Baseball is widely believed to not want any financial information in open court, which would occur in this case. If they're serious about preventing that, it may now be in their best interest to settle with the Orioles to get them to stop making noise about it - not unlike the agreement that allowed the Nationals into Orioles territory to begin with.    Another reporter at the hearing, the Sports Business Journal's Eric Fisher, elaborated on why it was a big victory for the O's:  In other words, MASN scored a big legal victory not even using today all of its argumentative ammo spelled out in its prior filings\r \xe2\x80\x94 Eric Fisher (@EricFisherSBJ) August 18, 2014     He noted that MASN spent more time arguing the potential legal conflicts of interest rather than any of the monetary issues with the revenue sharing pool, and that the judge seemed to mostly issue the injunction due to the tangled relationships between Proskauer Rose and MLB and the panel members.    Barker reported that the judge accepted an offer from MASN to put up a bond of $20 million so that, should the rights fee dispute go against them in subsequent proceedings, that money is guaranteed to be paid to the Nationals. So if they win, they will get paid, but the Nats can't force any action in the meantime.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Jon Durr-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles right fielder Nick Markakis just about decapitated White Sox starter Chris Sale with the leadoff hit in the game Monday night. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the hardest-hit ball of the evening for Nick. After Jonathan Schoop broke open a 3-2 game with a two-out, bases-loaded double in the top of the eighth inning, Markakis totally turned on a slider and hit it about as hard as is possible for a two-run shot to right field.The ball was about 20 feet higher than a ball hit toward Markakis in the bottom of the previous inning. With the Orioles clinging to a 3-2 lead with the Sox having a runner on base with two outs, Conor Gillaspie hit a ball to the fence that Nick timed perfectly to bring it back into the park. Within the space of one inning of play, Markakis single-handedly accounted for a four-run swing in the score.The Orioles prevailed in the end 8-2, using a five-run eighth inning to break open what was a close game and beat one of the best pitchers in the American League.The entire game was among the finest the Orioles have played this season.The trademark power was there \xe2\x80\x93 with home runs by J.J.

Orioles pitching has now given up just five hits in the last 18 innings.The trademark outstanding Orioles defense had Chicago fans applauding in appreciation for the talent displayed. Not only did Markakis make the aforementioned highlight reel catch, he will be joined on it in sports programs by an amazing sliding catch by Nelson Cruz. And a caught-stealing throw by Caleb Joseph should be shown on films of baseball fundamentals about catcher footwork in a stealing situation. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterThere is simply nothing to criticize about this game or any plays or efforts of any of the Baltimore Orioles.The Birds picked up a half-game each on both the Blue Jays and Yankees who were each idle.For the second game in the series, Chris Tillman (9-5, 3.68) will go against Jose Quintana (6-9, 3.14).

That was the first thing to pop into many a fans mind when Cord Phelps was called upon to take Manny Machado\'s spot on the Orioles roster for the time being. He is no Manny but is one of those ""happy to be here"" kind of guys that, upon further review, I think I\'m happy to have on the team. Ya know, until Manny is back. Name: Robert Cord Phelps Number: 38Born: January 23, 1987 (27 years old) in Santa Barbara, CAHeight: 6\'1"" Weight: 210 lbsBats: Both Throws: RightDrafted: 3rd round in 2008 by the Cleveland IndiansSchool: Santa Barbara High School (Santa Barbara, CA)Stanford University (Palo Alto, CA)Contract: $500,000 salary in 2014\xc2\xa0Walk-up song: ""It\'s a Long Way to the Top"" By: AC/DC Personal It\'s quite possible that, in Phelps, the Orioles have just added their smartest player to the club. (I\'m sure Darren O\'Day may beg to differ). He grew up in the Golden State and attended Santa Barbara High School. There he was ""the nerd"" and ""the jock"" all rolled into one. In the classroom he would take home honors such as National AP Scholar and National Merit Scholar as well as awards from Bank of America and his high school for academic achievement and had a GPA of 4.83. But he was only his class\' salutatorian, so he could have done better. As with most future big league players he excelled on the the diamond in high school. Throughout his career he was named to all-league and all-division teams. In the summer after his junior year he played games with the St. Louis Cardinals scout team. His senior year he led his team in nearly every offensive category including batting average (.415), RBI (24), on base percentage (.581) and a slew of other things. The combination of his success in the field and on the report card earned him his school\'s Scholar-Athlete award. Despite an outstanding high school career, Phelps did not garner huge recognition from professional scouts. He went undrafted and was set for college. So, where do you go in California if you are incredibly smart and a gifted athlete. There are many options; maybe USC or UCLA, but for Phelps, one stood out above them all; Stanford University.    ""You can\'t beat the quality of the baseball program and the academics,"" he told GoStanford.com.    As a freshman, Phelps played in about half of the Cardinal\'s games but would only post a .196 batting average as he adjusted to NCAA play. He split his time between second and third base, an ability that would eventually help him in professional baseball. He would do the same the following season, even adding innings at shortstop. His junior season was where he stood out. He was named the Most Improved Player at Stanford and selected to the All-Pac-10 team. He did so by smashing 13 home runs and 58 RBI and managing the highest fielding percentage of his collegiate career (.975).    This was enough to beckon a call from the professional ranks. The Indians selected him with their third round selection. He decide to forego his senior year in exchange for a chance at the big-time, signing with Cleveland. He was sent to the Gulf Coast League for one day; that\'s not an exaggeration. He had one start and three at-bats there. He went 0-for-3 and was then sent to short season Mahoning Valley where he raked for 35 games, hitting .312 with 10 doubles and two home runs in 25 games. The following season he began at High-A Kinston and that is where he would stay all season as he struggled to find his way. The power he had shown at short season was gone. Depite playing a full season there, he only managed four home runs, equating to a .363 slugging percentage. However, he was getting on base at a decent clip of .386.    Even with the struggles he was still moved up to double-A Akron and this where his talents started to show real promise. Phelps split that 2010 season between Akron and Triple-A Columbus. In Akron had a line of .296/.346/.397; not bad. But he really shined in Columbus, slashing .317/.386/.506. The success continued in 2011 as he did well again in Triple-A, earning promotion to Cleveland in June of that year. He wasn\'t so hot there, managing to hit just .155 in 71 at-bats and sat on the bench for much of his time in the majors that season. Despite this he was still named the Indians\' 15th best prospect; his highest ranking ever. He would continue to bounce between Cleveland and Columbus for the next two seasons; always playing much better for the Clippers than the Indians. At different points, Baseball American recognized him as one best defensive second basemen in the Indians system, as well as having good discipline at the plate. This past November, the Indians were trying to clear space on the 40-man roster to protect certain players from the Rule 5 Draft. In this process, Cleveland had to designate Phelps for assignment. Five days later, the Orioles claimed him off waivers the same day they grabbed Brad Brach from the Padres. Phelps has spent almost all of 2014 with the Triple-A Norfolk Tides. There he has batted just .258 but in the three weeks leading up to his recent promotion he had found his minor league swing, averaging .329 with three doubles, a triple and a home run in that span.    On top of that, he was recommended to Orioles manager Buck Showalter by scouts and Tides manager Ron Johnson. Not to mention Phelps is a solid defender who provides depth at each infield position and could probably play some outfield in the bigs too if given the chance. And he has pulled the Chris Davis times three; the Tides have made the call to the bullpen for Phelps on three different occasions. He sounds like the type of guy that Birdland could become very fond of right away. He is out of options and will likely be the one moved once Machado is ready to return, but Showalter and Dan Duquette have been known to do crazy things. With September just around the corner, things can only get crazier.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles beat another strong White Sox lefty with a 5-1 win ...', ' One night after facing a Cy Young contender like Chris Sale, the Orioles were tasked with another difficult matchup, a tough lefty in White Sox starter Jose Quintana. Still conditioned to expect the worst when the Orioles face the league\'s best, I did not anticipate good things. I forgot who we were talking about, though. These are the 2014 Orioles. Their opportunities were few, but they delivered in the clutch, driving to a 5-1 victory over Chicago on Tuesday night. That win, coupled with Yankees and Blue Jays losses, means the Orioles gain a game on each of their divisional competitors, now leading New York by 8.5 games and Toronto by nine. There are 38 games left to play and the Orioles lead is closer to double digits than zero. They are 20 games over .500. This is not a dream. This is reality. Buoyed by the pre-game news that Ubaldo Jimenez has been jettisoned from the starting rotation - actually, I don\'t think he was buoyed, but I sure was - Chris Tillman, who started the game, turned in a gem. The best thing to be said about Tillman tonight is that he made it a boring game. Over eight innings, he only gave up one run on three hits and a walk. The one run came on a first inning mistake to White Sox slugger Jose Abreu, who crushed a baseball into the seats in left center for his 32nd home run of the year. Tillman never faced more than four batters in a single inning and he never faced a batter while there was a runner in scoring position in the whole game. He struck out nine batters. That is ho-hum dominance, the kind of thing you\'re just not expecting to see from Orioles starters. Tillman lowered his season ERA to 3.55 as he picked up his 10th win of the year.    ""The curveball was there for me tonight,"" Tillman told MASN\'s Gary Thorne in his post-game interview. We\'ve all seen those games where he can\'t find the strike zone with it for anything. When it\'s on, though, you get games like tonight. Any Orioles starter who goes eight innings while only allowing one run is going to have a pretty good chance of winning the game.    For Tillman, it was his 12th quality start in his last 14 outings. He hasn\'t allowed more than three earned runs since his one inning mess on June 5 against Texas. As a team, the Orioles only had nine hits over the whole game. That\'s much less than some of the double-digit barrages they have unleashed in recent wins. They only scored a single run by a home run. There are a lot of ways to win a baseball game. The Orioles are finding many of them. On Tuesday, it was timely hitting that brought them to victory.    They got things started from the top of the first inning. Steve Pearce proved he isn\'t quite yet turned into a pumpkin by hitting a ground rule double over the left field fence. Pearce scored easily on an RBI single delivered by Adam Jones, who collected his 76th RBI of the season in the process. That gave the Orioles a 1-0 lead after half an inning, although the Abreu home run in the bottom half meant it didn\'t last for long. Quintana locked them down for a while after that, sending the Orioles down in order in innings 2-4 and allowing only a single to Nick Hundley in the fifth inning. Hundley also somehow stole second base before the inning ended. Catcher speed! Orioles bats will only stay quiet for so long. Sometimes they slumber for whole nights, but sometimes they wake up before the game ends, and if their starter has kept them close, then the game is afoot. Tuesday\'s game was the latter sort.    Whether Quintana tired or the Orioles simply figured something out in the third time through the order, they were able to break through in the sixth inning. Jones got himself on base with a one-out double. One batter later, it looked like he might score on a silo shot from Nelson Cruz, but the ball stopped carrying and died on the warning track. He just missed the mistake pitch. That doesn\'t matter, because the Orioles have a bunch of guys who can get you. Delmon Young gave the O\'s a 2-1 lead with a single into center, easily enough to score the high-1954-socked Jones. The stripes give you extra speed, don\'t you know. They were not done there, either. The flurry of hits continued with a single by birthday boy J.J. Hardy, moving Young up to third. Sub-Mendoza Chris Davis even got in on the act, clearing the bases with a double that split the outfielders in right-center. The 4-1 lead was all they would need, but just for fun, Hundley added a solo homer in the seventh, his third Orioles homer of the season, fourth overall. Why the heck not, right? In one of those stats that only could excite Jim Hunter, it turns out that the Orioles are 9-1 in games where Hundley has an RBI. They are also 1-0 when he steals a base. Hey, whatever works. Tommy Hunter pitched a scoreless ninth. Just about the only downer for the Orioles was that Nick Markakis had a hitting streak halted at ten games. He did his part last night. Others did theirs tonight. This team is 20 games over .500. They\'ve won 72 games this year, something they only did twice from 2001-2011. No team in the division has allowed fewer runs than the Orioles. They are not messing around. The Orioles go for the sweep against Chicago on Wednesday night for a scheduled 8:10pm game. After beating Sale and Quintana, they\'ll probably lose to Hector Noesi. That\'s life. Wei-Yin Chen starts the game for the O\'s. If nothing else, they\'re back to winning a series.

I\xe2\x80\x99m here to answer one of those for you.This move wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so hard for the Orioles to make due to the fact that the roster expands to 40 for the month of September. However, as September winds down, The Orioles will have a problem on their hands, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily a good one.The reason being that the Orioles signed Jimenez to a four-year deal worth $50 million in the offseason. It looks a little foolish putting him in the bullpen in the first year of that big contract, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? However, this can also be considered a good problem in that the Orioles have too much depth at the position to make room for Jimenez.Putting that aside, let\xe2\x80\x99s get back to the original question: Will Jimenez make the playoff roster?One thing I will tell you is that there is a 99 percent chance that he won\xe2\x80\x99t make the roster as a starting pitcher. However, making the roster as a relief pitcher is certainly a possibility, though not definitive. The reason it\xe2\x80\x99s not definitive is because the Orioles have a lot of depth in the bullpen that they are going to be hesitant to leave off the postseason roster.Live Feed ubaldo jimenezBaltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Fun facts as the first trip to Yankee Stadium gets underway The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles Clicking on All Cylinders The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: What to Make of Recent Stellar Starts by Jimenez, Miley The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: What's next for Ubaldo Jim\xc3\xa9nez?

Brad Brach has performed very well for the Orioles this season, posting a 4-0 record with a 2.61 ERA in 29 games. He has allowed just three home runs on the year. If those are the numbers of your fourth-best reliever, then you\xe2\x80\x99re in good shape.When the team traded for Andrew Miller, most fans probably thought that fellow left-handed reliever Brian Matusz would be sent down to the minors due to his struggles, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case. Matusz has stayed on the active roster and has done a decent job at times, but for the most part continues to struggle with an ERA of 4.10. There is also T.J. McFarland, but he will likely be moved down once Miguel Gonzalez returns from the disabled list.With that being said, it looks like Jimenez will take up Matusz\xe2\x80\x99 spot in the bullpen; and as for Matusz, who knows what will happen to him?To answer the question here: yes, Jimenez will most likely make the playoff roster, but it\xe2\x80\x99s almost solely due to the fact that he got such a big contract. To sign a player to a contract that large and even consider he might not be worthy of the postseason roster is pretty sad, but that\xe2\x80\x99s baseball.

The Orioles won 9-2. Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles hold a strong lead in the American League East, and there are some strong keys in their play that look toward a divisional crown for the first time in years.Along with already doing these things, if the Orioles continue to do them, I believe the division is well in their hands.1. PitchingThe Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starting and relief pitching has been excellent, and has helped push the AL East lead to eight and a half games above the second place team, which has been the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays at different points.Despite Wei-Yin Chen being atop my rankings for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters, the Orioles need Chris Tillman and Bud Norris to keep pitching as well as they have recently.In 13 starts since the All-Star break, Tillman and Norris are a combined 7-1 with an ERA of 2.52 between the two pitchers. They have a combined WHIP of 1.01.Both pitchers have been dominating and have certainly led the charge for this strong Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching staff.There is one key to continue this success, which the Orioles had no choice to follow until recently, and that is to not allow Ubaldo Jimenez to start. \xe2\x80\x9cJimenez is only hurting the Orioles as a team\xe2\x80\x9dHe may have $43 million contract, but he is not worth the money. Jimenez is only hurting the Orioles as a team, and is not helping the bullpen with his short starts.As of now, the Orioles have moved Jimenez from a starting role to the bullpen. Before this, an injury kept Jimenez from starting, and in that time, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers began their current stretch of dominance.Unless he proves he can be consistent while in the bullpen, he should not be allowed to start again this year.2. OffenseThe Orioles offense has been hitting the ball well with 44 home runs since the All-Star break, which leads all of baseball.However, as much as I do not like to say it and see them rely upon it, the Orioles need to continue to hit the home run ball.

These extra-base hits not only score runs, but keep runners on base to keep pressure on the opposing pitchers.They may not be using small ball to score runs, but the Orioles have been hitting more doubles and running the bases well. The home runs are a big part of the offense, but the other extra-base hits are showing up more and more.A sign of a strong team has been aggressive base running. The Orioles are scoring from first on doubles and scoring from second on singles, because they are aggressive and recognize who the outfielders are so they can successfully do this.3. AL East DominanceThe Orioles have had a consistent dominance over their division rivals, and with the 27 games against them through the rest of the season, this trend will secure the Orioles the division crown.14 of those games are against the Yankees or Blue Jays, which as they are both more than eight games back, the Orioles can easily knock them out of contention.The Orioles have a 30-19 record against the AL East with 56 home runs while allowing 52. The offense has scored 217 runs against their own division, with only the Blue Jays scoring more runs than the Orioles in the season series so far.The Orioles pitching has an overall 3.42 ERA against the AL East. The Blue Jays are the only team that the Orioles have an ERA higher than four against. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no way they cannot take the division\xe2\x80\x9dIn the search for the division crown, if the Orioles win a majority of their games against the AL East, there is no way they cannot take the division.These three things have allowed the Orioles to begin to run away with the AL East. And if they continue to do them, the Orioles are well on their way to the divisional crown.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAt this point, the AL East title is a foregone conclusion for the Baltimore Orioles. MLB.com\xe2\x80\x99s playoff odds (via Baseball Prospectus) give the team\xc2\xa0a 96.0% chance of winning the division; FanGraphs, while marginally more pessimistic at 94.5%, still believes the same. This comes as no surprise to Baltimore fans, who have witnessed the team\xe2\x80\x99s post-All Star Break hegemony and contemporaneous mediocrity from Toronto and New York. No, what the Oriole faithful care about now is how well this club will do once it reaches the postseason. That performance will hinge on several players, one of whom dominated last night.For the season as a whole, Chris Tillman has been lucky. His 3.55 ERA overshadows a 4.32 xFIP and 4.39 SIERA; the former number ranks 47th out of 94 qualified pitches, but the latter two come in at 80th and 81st, respectively. In yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game against the Chicago White Sox, however, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t derive his success from luck, but from skill: Striking out nine South Siders while only walking one, he supported his 1.13 ERA with a 2.20 xFIP and a 2.07 SIERA in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 5-1 victory.This was no fluke for Tillman. In his past five starts, he owns a 2.14 ERA, with a 2.79 xFIP and 2.78 SIERA to go along with it. Compare that to his previous 22 outings, in which he posted a 3.92 ERA, 4.71 xFIP, and 4.78 SIERA, and you see that he has made notable \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0and legitimate \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0improvements to his game. Should this trend continue, it would bear well for the Birds come October. Digging a little deeper, we see that there\xe2\x80\x99s evidence to suggest it will.Strikeouts and walks have actuated Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s step forward; whereas earlier, he\xc2\xa0fanned 14.6% of opposing batters while issuing free passes at a 9.0% rate, now he has bettered those numbers to 25.0% and 2.4%, respectively. Pinning the former two rates at 14.3% and 9.1%, respectively, Mike Podhorzer\xe2\x80\x99s xK%\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0xBB% formulas substantiate his initial struggles. Those equations don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as confidently about his recent achievements, as they think his strikeout and walk rates should be 21.0% and 6.2%, respectively; nevertheless, those still significantly exceed his theretofore rates. Moreover, looking into those statistics shows the causes of his improvements: He has accrued more swinging strikes (14.5% S/Str%, as opposed to 10.1% before) and has thrown more strikes as a whole (65.8%, as opposed to 62.2% before).Now, this is where the trends come in. As I said earlier, regular season output doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make all that much of a difference to the Orioles right now. They only care (or, at least, they\xc2\xa0should\xc2\xa0only care) about what will happen after the season\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion. So they, presumably, would like to know if Tillman has actually turned the corner, and if they should give the ball to him in Game 5 of a postseason series.Obviously, Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s aforementioned xFIP and SIERA marks give credence to his ERA, and his xK% and xBB% marks do the same for his xFIP and SIERA. But why has he seen an increase in efficacy as of late?Tillman hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gained any noticeable velocity or movement, nor has he momentously altered his pitch location. He has decreased his changeup usage a bit, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like enough to cause all this. Instead, I feel as though something else is behind this: his delivery. Look at these screenshots of him \xe2\x80\x94 first, from\xc2\xa0Opening Day\xe2\x80\x99s win over the Boston Red Sox:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Source)And, by contrast, from August 8th\xe2\x80\x99s rout of the St. Louis Cardinals:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Source)They seem fairly analogous, right? Look at Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s feet. The delivery hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, but its location has\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 he now throws further to the right of the rubber than he ever has. The data back this up too, as the following chart shows:PitchAverage Horizontal Release Point (1-22)Average Horizontal Release Point (23-27)Fourseam-2.02-2.49Sinker-2.11-2.66Changeup-2.08-2.53Curveball-2.18-2.55Cutter-2.28-2.68Does a move to the right grant someone greater ability to deceive? If the first eight years of this millennium\xc2\xa0were any indication, it does. In all seriousness, though, this strikes me as the most plausible explanation for Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s recent success, since there don\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be any others. I\xe2\x80\x99m far from an expert on the matter, but this also seems like something that Tillman can easily maintain; if he does\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 and if it continues to bring him the same results\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 he could be a weapon for the Orioles going forward.All statistics courtesy of Baseball-Reference.

Before their three game series in Chicago on Monday, the Orioles had just finished a tremendous stretch playing 36 games against above .500 teams since July 7. In that time the Orioles went 22-14. Now the Orioles have 20 consecutive games against teams with losing records, and don\xe2\x80\x99t play another winning ball club again until the Yankees come to Camden Yards on September 12. This could be an ideal time for Orioles really build some momentum to carry into the playoffs. The biggest concern for the Orioles between now and the playoffs is getting and staying healthy. The obvious example of this is Manny Machado. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take an expert to see that when Machado\xe2\x80\x99s on the field the Orioles are a much better team. He\xe2\x80\x99s a Platinum Glove winner and his extra-base power lengthens an already strong lineup. Chris Davis has done a decent job at third so far, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t replace the best fielding third-baseman in baseball. Also, Steve Pearce is a decent first baseman, but Davis has turned into one of the best fielding first-baseman in the game so having Machado on the D.L. weakens both corners of their infield. But the Orioles are going to be sure he\xe2\x80\x99s 100% before he comes back. He\xe2\x80\x99s the future face of the franchise so they have reason to be cautious. Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans hoping for a speedy recovery are probably going to be disappointed. One of the greatest strengths of late has been the starting pitching, and one of the main factors of their success has been health. The Orioles have used only 7 starters this season, including the one start T.J. McFarland made, in comparison the Yankees have used 13. The only issue could be because the starters have made the majority of their scheduled starts every starter could be at or over their career highs in innings going into October. Just to be sure everyone is fresh going into the playoffs, Buck could give certain starters extra days of rest by giving T.J. McFarland or even Steve Johnson some starts in September. The biggest issue the Orioles could have is monotony. With 37 games left and a nine game lead over the Blue Jays and Yankees the division race is relatively over. If the Orioles only win 19 of their remaining games the Yankees would need to go 29-8 the rest of the way. That\xe2\x80\x99s just not going to happen. Buck\xe2\x80\x99s challenge will be to keep the team from falling asleep at the wheel and backing into the playoffs after a lackluster month.

08/22/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Buck Showalter for Manager of the Year?', 'One thing that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard much talk about thus far in 2014 is the Manager of the Year award. The fact is that William Nathaniel Showalter is quickly gaining \xe2\x80\x9cscomaint status\xe2\x80\x9d in Baltimore for how he\xe2\x80\x99s turned around the Baltimore Orioles. That in and of itself isn\xe2\x80\x99t grounds for him getting Manager of the Year.  However in submitting his name out there for consideration, I suppose my question would be \xe2\x80\x9cWHY NOT Buck Showalter?\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter almost won the award in 2012 when he led the Orioles to the promised land (post season) for the first time in 14 years. He was beaten out by Oakland manager Bob Melvin by one vote if I recall. Many people felt he was robbed, and in a certain sense I did as well. However Melvin was just as deserving of a candidate, and for very similar reasons. So while it was a shame for Buck that he lost, he lost out to a very deserving candidate.But this year I would submit that it\xe2\x80\x99s a little different. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how many people had the Orioles finishing where it looks like they\xe2\x80\x99re going to finish. (For the reecord, I predicted 92 wins \xe2\x80\x93 although I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say in what place in the standings I thought the Orioles would finish.) But the fact is that some pundits had the Orioles finishing fifth\xe2\x80\xa6yeah, dead last! While most people are going to tell you that the AL East is over and done as of right now, I would still say to be careful with that. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead is very solid for sure; however it\xe2\x80\x99s not over until it\xe2\x80\x99s over.But that aside, I would submit to the voters for the Manager of the Year award that what Showalter has done this year has been about asCourtesy of Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sportsnoteworthy as any manager in any season. He\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly stayed ahead of the curve in the sense that he has the uncanny ability to manager several at bats and in some cases several innings in anticipation. He seems to match up in terms of bullpen relievers and hitters better than anyone in the game, and he knows how to ride the hot hand until just prior to it being gone.However perhaps more than any of those factors, Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s among the very best leaders in the game and in sports. He would tell you that part of it is having good players, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a very valid point. However all of the pieces have to be stirred together correctly, and seemingly every button he\xe2\x80\x99s pushed has brought the elevator to the correct floor.This is not to say that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t other deserving candidates out there. But for a team that was expected to take a step backwards this year to be finishing where it appears they\xe2\x80\x99re going to finish, it just seems to me that Buck Showalter is the most deserving. On the flip side of course, if you listen to many pundits talk now it seems that suddenly the AL East is a \xe2\x80\x9cweak division.\xe2\x80\x9d So perhaps the O\xe2\x80\x99s are poised to win the division merely by default. Luckily, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that most of the so-called experts have said about the 2014 Baltimore Orioles that has rang true as of yet.The Orioles will switch sides of Chicago this afternoon as they make a rare three-game visit to the Friendly Confines of Wrigley Field to play three games with the Chicago Cubs. One thing of note, the Birds will play three afternoon games at Wrigley this weekend, starting at 2:20 EST this afternoon. The O\xe2\x80\x99s of course famously don\xe2\x80\x99t always play well under the afternoon sun, which is something that will have to change if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to conti.nue to see success in Chicagoland this weekend.Kevin Gausman will get the start today, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by former Oriole Jake Arrieta. One also has to expect to see former Oriole Pedro Strop coming out of the Chicago pen at some point this weekend as well. The Birds of course traded Arrieta and Strop to Chicago last year for pitcher Scott Feldman and catcher Steve Clevenger.Arrieta has had a great season thus far with the Cubs, and one that included a near no-hitter in Boston earlier this summer. So did the Orioles get rid of him too early? Personally I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so; he was a classic \xe2\x80\x9cneed a change of scenery\xe2\x80\x9d guy when he left Baltimore.

This is not good news for the Orioles, even with the largest divisional lead in baseball.The incident happened on a swing in a game on August 11th, where Machado went down in a heap in the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box. The appearance at the time was not good, and this news of a pending surgery is actually not that surprising to be quite honest. The Orioles have spoken over the past 10 days of hopes of resuming baseball activities and seeing Manny back on the field, but between the lines, nothing sounded like any specific progress toward such healing was taking place.There are two questions that arise quickly from this:First \xe2\x80\x93 What are the Baltimore Orioles going to do for the rest of the season without him and how does this affect their chances?There is no doubt that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are a better team with Machado than without him.

With him in the order their record is 47-35 (.573), and without him it is 26-18 (.590).Secondly \xe2\x80\x93 What does this say about Manny Machado and his long-term prospects for a healthy career? I believe there is substantive reason for concern. As a retired running coach of many years, I wrote an extensive piece on this topic last week, and you may see that HERE.The surgery on Machado\xe2\x80\x99s right knee will be performed by Dr. Neal ElAttrache \xe2\x80\x93 the same doctor who did his surgery last year.What a weird year this has been for injuries throughout baseball! And football is supposed to be the sport with all the physical damage. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles predictably beaten by Jake Arrieta, Pedro Strop in ...', "" Just like they drew it up a few years ago, Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop locked down a meaningful August Orioles game. Too bad for the Orioles that they are now pitching for the other team. Thwarted by some stellar infield defense and a couple of dingers, the Orioles had their winning streak halted by the Cubs Friday afternoon in a 4-1 loss. One seemingly constant hallmark of Arrieta's time in Baltimore was when bad luck - a blown call, an error, a misplay - turned into a meltdown. The BABIP dragon was on his side on Friday's game, however, starting from the game's second batter, when Steve Pearce lined a rocket right into the path of the leaping third baseman Luis Valbuena. Our old friend Jake made the most of this good fortune all through the game. Arrieta held the Orioles perfect through four innings, just long enough to make you nervous that it might happen, but thankfully Chris Davis hit a one out single in the fifth to put an end to that. J.J. Hardy followed with a rare walk - rare for Hardy and for the National League incarnation of Arrieta, whose success I can't help but enjoy except for this uncommon occurrence of him pitching against the Orioles. With two men on and two out, O's catcher Caleb Joseph blooped a single to right field. The windmill in the form of the third base coach waved Davis home on this shallow blooper, which was fielded perfectly by Cubs right fielder Ryan Sweeney, who fired in to home. There, catcher John Baker caught the ball and tagged out Davis with plenty of time to spare.    On MASN, Jim Palmer immediately erupted that this was a case of the plate being blocked in circumvention of the new anti-collision rules. Manager Buck Showalter must have thought the same and he persuaded the umpiring crew to initiate a crew chief review of the play. There is nothing clear about the plate blocking rules. People see what they want to see. Gary Thorne disagreed with Palmer, saying that the catcher left the back of the plate open. I didn't agree with either one of them; I thought Baker caught the ball so early it didn't matter where he blocked.    In any case, the umpires in New York upheld the call on the field, so Davis was out and the O's got nothing. Maybe Davis got a terrible jump on the play, or maybe he's slow and should have never been sent on a ball so shallow. The opportunity was denied. By this point, the Orioles trailed 2-0. Starter Kevin Gausman got himself seven strikeouts in five innings, which sounds pretty nice. It wasn't a good day for Gausman, though. He only threw first pitch strikes to seven of the 21 batters he faced, and while he didn't walk anyone, he wasted plenty of pitches, and made his share of mistakes, for which he was made to pay. Valbuena broke the scoreless tie in the bottom of the fourth on a mistake pitch for his 12th homer of the season.    Another mistake to shortstop Javier Baez in the fifth inning resulted in another home run. Baez can essentially only hit mistakes. Gausman hung a slider and Baez crushed the ball a long, long way, out onto the street beyond the left field bleachers at Wrigley Field. He was visibly frustrated, with MASN's cameras catching him unleashing probably the most strenuous F-bomb seen from an O's player this season. Better frustration than resignation, but better a strikeout than neither. Instead it was Baez's sixth homer of the year, giving the Cubs a 3-0 lead. Gausman's final line was three runs on six hits in five innings, adding the seven strikeouts, which tied his career high. On the other hand, against his former team, Arrieta pitched seven innings, giving up only a run on four hits and a walk, while striking out five. The only damage they inflicted against Arrieta came in the seventh inning, when Nelson Cruz fired a laser just over the left field fence, his MLB-leading 34th home run of the season. That's also a new career high for Cruz. Too bad nobody else wanted to get in on the party.    Strop came in to pitch the eighth inning, looking like the good Strop of early 2012 rather than the Strop vs. the Yankees of late 2012. Actually, he allowed a couple of baserunners, giving up a walk to Ryan Flaherty and a single to Pearce, but then he was bailed out when his second baseman, Chris Valaika, made a great diving stop on a Jones grounder that was trying to sneak into right field. On another day, that might have gone through. On Friday, no chance. It was an annoying loss, but then, aren't they all? If they looked like this every night, that would be bad. They do not. Most nights, a pitcher is not going to look as good as Arrieta did on Friday, nor will most teams' defense rob as many would-be hits from O's batters. At the worst, the O's will end the night eight games up in the American League East. The Yankees are still to play the White Sox, with the Blue Jays taking on the Rays in Friday night action. One or both of the underdogs might come through. The O's will be back at it again on Saturday afternoon at 2:20pm Eastern, taking on Chicago's Kyle Hendricks, who just sounds like the kind of guy who will annoyingly dominate the Orioles. Bud Norris gets the start for the O's.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

He also walked a pair of batters, and two of the hits were home runs. His ERA at the level stands at 3.57. Suk-min Yoon, who could be the next Tsuyoshi Wada, allowed a run in 1.2 innings, while Joe Saunders, the possible Brian Matusz replacement of my dreams, pitched two scoreless. Tides hitters only mustered three hits in the whole game. One of these was an RBI single hit by Dariel Alvarez, who also walked. Double-A: Richmond (Giants) 3, Bowie 0 Against the #7 prospect in the Giants system, Clayton Blackburn, the Baysox weren't able to do a whole lot. While Bowie got seven hits in the game, only one of them was good for extra bases. Mike Yastrzemski had two hits, as did Niuman Romero, who had two hits including the lone Baysox double. They only had three at-bats with a runner in scoring position all game. The Baysox starter was Zach Davies, the #8 prospect in the O's system according to MLB.com. He didn't do so well as Blackburn, although he did strike out seven batters while allowing only two earned runs in 5.1 innings. More impressively, he had eight groundouts to two flyouts. Maybe the defense did him in. Davies, who's just 21, has a 3.03 ERA in his first taste of the Eastern League.    High-A: Potomac (Nationals) 4, Frederick 3 (10 innings) It was an error-riddled night for the Keys, which is probably what you expect from the Carolina League. They had five on the night, including two by third baseman Jason Esposito. The winning run scored due to a throwing error made by Esposito.    For the Keys, Sebastian Vader allowed a run in six innings and Matt Hobgood gave up one earned run in three innings pitched. Trey Mancini, Jerome Pena, and Wynston Sawyer all had multi-hit games, with Sawyer delivering a two-run homer to give the Keys a temporary ninth inning lead. It was his fourth home run for the Keys. Low-A: Asheville (Rockies) 3, Delmarva 0 The Shorebirds also ran into a top pitching prospect for a franchise and didn't make out too well. The Tourists' Kyle Freeland is rated the #3 prospect in the Rockies system. He held them to three hits in five innings and struck out six. Those were the only hits that the Shorebirds got in the game.    Delmarva's starter was Bennett Parry, a 40th round pick from 2011. Parry gave up three runs, two earned, on four hits and two walks, striking out ten Asheville batters in the process. Williams Louico added three scoreless innings, while Towson University product Nik Nowottnick threw a scoreless ninth. Short Season-A: Aberdeen 5, Lowell (Red Sox) 2 We have a winner, at last! The Ironbirds made the most out of seven hits, going 4-for-7 with runners in scoring position to take down the Spinners. Shortstop Stephen Wilkerson and catcher Tanner Murphy both had multi-hit games with an RBI each. Austin Anderson and Jamill Moquete also drove in a run each for Aberdeen. The Ironbirds got a five-inning effort from 2014 11th rounder John Means, who found that he was justified by the ends as he notched five strikeouts and gave up two runs on five hits and a walk.    Gulf Coast: GCL Orioles 12, GCL Rays 3 The GCL Birds scored seven runs in the game's first inning and went on to record 17 hits in the game. That's something of a thumping, to say the least. The big rookie-league O's performer was second baseman Ronarsy Ledesma, who went 2-5 and drove in three runs.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles demonstrate many ways to lose a baseball game in 7 ...', "" There are a lot of ways to lose a baseball game. The Orioles dabbled in many of them on Saturday, falling 7-2 to the Cubs in a game that was interrupted by a rain delay of over three hours. All that did was prolong the misery before the O's lost their second straight game. One way you lose a baseball game is bad luck. The Orioles experienced this as the Cubs batted in the second inning, managing to load the bases and score a run on three straight singles, none of which were hit hard. What made it even more unfortunate is the fact that two of the plays were ground balls in the direction of third that you just knew Manny Machado would have made, because he's awesome. Instead, it's Chris Davis over there. That doesn't work out as well. That's a recipe for grounders to sneak through, or infield bouncers to not be able to be fielded and fired to first in time. BABIP luck on ground balls is going to go less in your favor when you replace Machado with Davis. The Cubs ended up scoring four of their seven runs in that inning, none of which would have scored with their usual top notch third baseman. Another way you lose a baseball game is making a bad pitch in the wrong situation, which the Orioles also experienced in the second inning. Starter Bud Norris found himself in a bases loaded, two out situation as a result of that chicanery, and in the end he surrendered all of the runs by leaving a pitch in the wrong place to Cubs left fielder Chris Coghlan, who lined a ball that bounced in air territory and rolled into the ample Wrigley foul ground. So, yes, the Orioles could have avoided most of those runners, but once they were on base and they had to be dealt wit, it was up to Norris to do something about that and he failed in his task.    That unfortunate second inning left the O's in a 4-2 hole. They had previously gotten the two runs by stringing together some base hits in each of the first and second innings. Adam Jones doubled home Steve Pearce in the first inning, while Norris plated J.J. Hardy with an infield single in the second inning. The AL starting pitcher getting an RBI is the kind of thing that might make it seem like your day - at that time, with the O's winning 2-0 after their half of the second inning, it was. That changed in a hurry.    Following the second inning, there was a rain delay of 3:09, a source of misery for most fans. Unlike the other night's Wrigley Field tarp mistake, the rain actually continued for quite some time. The ocean shook, the sky went black, and the captain quailed. They placed the tarp correctly and it just kept raining and raining. The rain chased both starters, Norris and the Cubs' Kyle Hendricks. With the O's getting five hits in two innings off Hendricks, they might have been able to get even more, so the weather was not especially on their side in that regard.    Norris was replaced after the rain by Ubaldo Jimenez in his first relief appearance since 2006, all the way back when he made his major league debut. You probably just cringed there, but actually he wasn't too bad, all things considered. Jimenez held the fort for four innings, more or less, allowing a run on three hits and a walk. He also struck out five batters. Jimenez probably would have kept pitching for another inning except his spot in the order came up after a seventh inning single by Nick Hundley. Trailing 5-2, that was a good time for the O's to have a real hitter come up to the plate. The pinch hitter was Cord Phelps, so whether he counts as a real hitter is another story. In any case, Phelps grounded into an inning-ending double play, so that was that. After the rain chased Hendricks from the game, the Orioles only got two more hits in the game's final seven innings. One of those hits didn't even result in a baserunner; Adam Jones tried to stretch a single into a double in the eighth inning and was thrown out. He tried a little too hard to spark something. It's hard to get too mad. It just didn't work out.    The other reason the Orioles lost was that Tommy Hunter sucked. Relieving Jimenez to start the seventh, he immediately gave up an opposite field shot to Cubs rookie masher Javier Baez, who is an absurdly strong dude but also swings and misses at nearly every off-speed pitch. Hunter gave up a couple more hard-hit balls in the eighth and ended up allowing two runs on four hits over two innings. So basically, even if the Orioles had Machado and prevented those four second inning runs, they still would have lost the game if everything else played out the way it did. They scored no runs after the second inning and gave up three more. They were unlucky and they were also bad, and they did not in any way deserve to win a baseball game on Saturday. Unfortunately for the O's, both of their chasing divisional rivals, the Yankees and the Blue Jays, won earlier on Saturday, meaning the O's lead in the division has been cut to seven games over New York and eight over Toronto. That's still the largest division lead in MLB, but they can't keep losing to bad teams if they want that to last. The O's will try to avoid the sweep on Sunday afternoon with a scheduled 2:20 Eastern game against the Cubs. Miguel Gonzalez looks to hold the line for the O's, while O's hitters will come up against one-time busted Orioles free agent signing Tsuyoshi Wada, who somehow has a 2.75 ERA. The National League is ridiculous.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
08/24/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Rain and Pain on the North Side of Chicago', 'A big lead in your division in Major League Baseball is made for days like Saturday\xe2\x80\x94a day where it was predetermined from the foundations of the world that absolutely nothing was going to go well for the Baltimore Orioles.This Birds were facing a tough, young pitcher in Kyle Hendricks, but they put together five hits in the first two innings to get a pair of runs. That usually portends a good day for the Orioles, especially when the starting pitcher gets credit for the second RBI.But in the bottom of the second, when Bud Norris failed to hit his spots, he gave up a walk. Then he hit his spots and gave up three junk singles. And finally, a very poor 3-2 pitch with two outs and the bases loaded was lined into the right-field corner for a triple by Chris Coghlan\xe2\x80\x94a player who was previously 0-for-16 off Norris.At that point, the weather completely joined the conspiracy against the Baltimore Orioles. The fog rolled in, the day turned to night, and the field became a pond.The best thing the Orioles could have done at that point was acknowledge that this was a day they were the bug and not the windshield, and simply forfeit the game to come back and play another day\xe2\x80\xa6 just go get some sleep, beat the Cubs on Sunday, and go home happy from a long nine-game trip.But no, they had to play it out.

Some might have expected the downpour to turn into a total hurricane at that point, but Jimenez pitched reasonably well for four innings\xe2\x80\x94giving up only one run on three hits, and only adding one walk to his league-leading total.Tommy Hunter would give up two more runs over two innings, and the offense never got back into the game at all\xe2\x80\x94tallying only two hits in the last seven innings. The final score was 7-2.And on a day like this, nobody needed to look at the scoreboard to know that both the Yankees and Blue Jays would win and draw to within seven and eight games respectively.One might ponder if the Manny Machado season-ending surgery news cast a pall over the mood along with the gloomy weather.

Mandatory Credit: David Richard-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have lost their second key position player for the season, as Manny Machado will have surgery on Wednesday on his knee. This is the opposite knee from last year, and hopefully this time Manny can get everything resolved before spring training.But, in the interim, the Orioles need to decide what to do to replace him.The easy answer is to continue to use Chris Davis and Ryan Flaherty at third base. Davis has looked good at third, although no one will replace Machado\xe2\x80\x99s platinum glove. Flaherty is also a very good defender at third.However, it is the hitting that is concerning. Flaherty does not provide a lot of offense, although I believe if he was starting frequently, it is possible he could heat up.Davis continues to be mired in a season-long slump, despite hitting HRs, still has a terrible batting average.The options from the minors include Cord Phelps, who I don\xe2\x80\x99t think is overly qualified to be in the majors. Remember, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about the rest of the season, but also the playoffs.Other options include two more intriguing players, Alexi Casilla and Steve Lombardozzi. Casilla has just finished rehabbing from an injury, and is known as a plus defender with speed. His hitting isn\xe2\x80\x99t probably any better than Flaherty, though.Steve Lombardozzi can certainly hit, but the fact he is in the minors has made it clear the O\xe2\x80\x99s don\xe2\x80\x99t trust him defensively. I think he could provide a decent bat at third.Another option is Jimmy Paredes, a guy the Orioles claimed not too long ago who can play all over the field, but is listed as a third baseman. He is a plus speed guy who is hitting .246 in Norfolk, but .287 for the season between Norfolk and Omaha.As far as acquiring a player, yes, I know Adrian Beltre is available. But, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he is the answer. Beltre would be expensive, is having a down season and is 35. Would he improve the offense? Yes, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean putting him there solves all the issues.As I type this, Jim Palmer and Gary Thorne are talking on the MASN broadcast about this very topic.

Probably most of you were not so fortunate.Catching up on the highlights of the game did not take much time. The actual highlights reel only had five seconds of tape on it: a long home run by Steve Pearce.Who knew that the Cleveland Indians and Chicago Cubs were secretly the best teams in baseball? The Cubs really do have some good pitching, at least for now.This Chicago game and series makes it impossible to not bring up an old theme from this season: the too-often AWOL offence of the Baltimore Orioles. Everyone worried about pitching before the season began, trotting out the old mare from the barn of baseball expressions of \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll go where the pitching takes us.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, yes\xe2\x80\xa6 that is sort of the nature of the game.

And it is true that a team is going to get shut down by some good pitching here and there. After all, the #1 stud horse in the barn of baseball expressions is, \xe2\x80\x9cgood pitching stops good hitting.\xe2\x80\x9d But does it have to stop the Baltimore Orioles so frequently?It is a surprising, but true, fact that even before this late run of quality O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching since the All-Star break \xe2\x80\x93 looking back to 2013 and 2012 even \xe2\x80\x93 more Orioles losses could be laid at the feet of anemic hitting than pitchers blowing games (even with Jim Johnson last year!).But let\xe2\x80\x99s just look at this year and consider the Orioles losses. So much talk this year has been focused upon the \xe2\x80\x9cmagic number four\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 four runs and you should most often win a game.

The answer is 17, and the last time that happened was in a 12-inning game on July 29th.The truth is that, apart from the league-leading home run total, the legend of the over-powering Orioles offense is a myth, one that preceded the loss of two regular players (though that does not help matters at all). They are #7 in the American League in batting average, 8th in runs scored, 11th in doubles, 14th in walks, and dead last by a mile in stolen bases. Jose Altuve has 15 more stolen bases than the entire Baltimore Orioles roster; Jacoby Ellsbury individually has three more.But the counter argument to all of this is that the Orioles have a six-game lead in the AL East on August 25th. And that carries a lot of weight, even as we also note that the current record of 73-55 would have had them 7.0 games out of first place on this date last year, 3.5 out in 2012, and 5.5 behind in 2011.But here is some good news to counter the gloomy mood after getting swept by the Chicago Cubs, the Baltimore Orioles come home for a three-team homestand, and 21 of the remaining 34 games are at Camden Yards.

However, relief was in the air when his X-rays came out negative and it was revealed to be just a sprain. Manny was placed on the 15-day disabled list. The thought was that he might not return for the regular season, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll for sure be ready to roll come playoff time. Right?Wrong.News broke late Friday afternoon that Manny Machado indeed suffered a partial tear in his knee that will require surgery and end his 2014 campaign \xe2\x80\x94 this coming a year after he partially tore a ligament in his other knee in a late-season game against the Tampa Bay Rays.At the time that the news was revealed, the O\xe2\x80\x99s were 21 games over .500 and held a nine-game lead on the second place Yankees which was the largest division lead in baseball. With that being said, it was hard for Orioles fans to really be disappointed at this point in time as they are on the verge of grabbing their first division crown since 1997. However, fans found ways to get upset.That\xe2\x80\x99s where I come in. I\xe2\x80\x99m here to cheer you up by telling you a few good reasons as to why Machado\xe2\x80\x99s injury wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the worst thing that could have happened:More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterWhen Machado returned from his injury in the second month of the season, his bat was, for a lack of a better term, slow. From May to mid-July, his average was hovering around the .210 mark. In 2013, he finished the season with a .283 average and hit a league-leading 51 doubles, so this was particularly upsetting. However as July progressed into August, his bat came alive. Slowly but surely, his average raised to .220, then .235, to .250, and all of a sudden it was at a very respectable mark of .278.When you look at his stats at the end of his career, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a nice .278 average for Machado in 2014. However, for the most part, he was a non-factor in the first four months of the season. Sure he helped the Orioles gain some separation in the East, but they maintained a record of ten games over .500 without his bat.Another reason not to panic is because his replacement has had a career year. With Chris Davis permanently moving to third base, Steve Pearce will take over his position at first. Before the year, if you would have told me that Steve Pearce would be starting, I would have thought this year were to be a disaster. However, that is not the case.If the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t win the World Series this year, it most likely won\xe2\x80\x99t be due to Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s injuryIn 80 games this year, Pearce is hitting to a .287 average with 14 home runs and 35 RBIs. All those numbers top Machado\xe2\x80\x99s and Manny played 82 games. Delmon Young, who has seen increased playing time due to Machado\xe2\x80\x99s injury, has hit a .300 average this year in 66 games played (190 at bats).I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that Steve Pearce or Delmon Young are better players than Manny Machado, not one bit. All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that the production for the remainder of the season is still there, and Machado\xe2\x80\x99s injury is no need to panic.The one place that the O\xe2\x80\x99s will miss Manny is on the field. His glove and arm are irreplaceable. However, if the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t win the World Series this year, it most likely won\xe2\x80\x99t be due to Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s injury. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles destroy Rays with pitching, defense, and five \\u2026', "" After the Orioles were swept by the last-place Chicago Cubs to complete their first losing road trip of the season, they needed a win like tonight. Everything worked well for them in this game. But while they got the home runs tonight, and they got the pitching, what people will be talking about is the catch made by Adam Jones in the sixth inning. He not only robbed Evan Longoria of a three-run home run, he also threw out Matt Joyce trying to tag up and go to second. It was a thing of beauty. So before we go any further, let's have a look: Your browser does not support iframes. Are you finished swooning? OK then, let's move on. Jones made that catch in support of starting pitcher Chris Tillman, who had been pitching a strong game but started the top of the sixth inning a little rusty. Prior to that he had looked good through five innings, though his defense had let him down in the third as he gave up his only run of the night. In that inning Yunel Escobar reached on an infield single that would have been a fantastic play by J.J. Hardy if first baseman Steve Pearce could have hung on to the ball. And on the next play, Jonathan Schoop muffed a catch at second, again thrown by Hardy. That error put runners on first and third with no outs for the Rays. Tillman induced a double play ball from Sean Rodriguez that allowed the unearned run to score from third. The Orioles didn't allow the unearned run to matter for long. In the bottom of the third inning Nick Markakis broke an 0-for-21 skid with a two-run home run into the Eutaw Street seats. And the next batter, Pearce, hit a no-doubt bomb to left field to give the Orioles a 3-1 lead.    Jake Odorizzi, who started for the Rays, wasn't sharp at all tonight. The O's broke the game open in the fifth inning as they sent ten batters to the plate and scored six runs. The highlight of the inning was back-to-back-to-back jacks that started with an Earl Weaver Special from Delmon Young followed by solo homers from Hardy and Chris Davis. When the dust cleared, the Orioles had a 9-1 lead and had knocked Odorizzi out of the game after just four innings plus five batters.    As you would imagine, a ten-batter inning in which six runs are scored takes awhile. As such, Tillman had quite some time on the bench while the offense was racking up hits. That brings us back to Tillman's rustiness, which brings us back to Jones's catch. Pinch hitter Brandon Guyer singled to left field, the third hit allowed by Tillman and the first to leave the infield. Tillman followed that with a walk to Matt Joyce, and while the game didn't feel in danger on account of the eight-run lead, it was starting to look like Tillman might not last much longer. That especially seemed true when Longoria hit a ball to center field that looked like it might get into the O's bullpen for a three-run home run. The amazing catch by Jones and even more impressive throw to second base to tag out Joyce thwarted the rally. Tillman got a ground out from James Loney to end the inning, then pitched a perfect seventh inning to end his night on the mound.    With only 84 pitches thrown, Tillman surely could have gone at least one more inning. But with neither Zach Britton or Darren O'Day appearing in the series against the Cubs, Buck Showalter opted to give each of them an inning of work to close out the game. They did so without drama. The feelgood win halts a three-game losing streak and while they didn't increase their division lead (the Yankees also won), they did shave their magic number to 28.

Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.1 IP, 6 H, 2 R, 0 BB, 3 K. Gonzalez pitched a great game, needless to say. However his mound opponent, former Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 farmhand Tsuyioshi Wada, pitched just a bit better. Wada had a no-hitter going until the seventh inning. However I would submit that Wada only really did one thing better than Gonzalez last night/; he took advantage of the large strike zone. Home plate umpire Dan Iassongna has a reputation as being a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s umpire.Courtesy of Jon Durr-USA TODAY SportsIn effect, Wada pitched to what the zone actually was as opposed to Gonzalez who pitched to what he and most people thought the zone should have actually been. Wada also had some very striking late movement on his pitches, which seemed to fool Oriole hitters all day long. Having said that, Gonzalez kept Chicago bats at bay for most of the game as well. So in writing this I also want to be very clear in that the Orioles couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have asked for more out of Gonzalez coming back to the big league level than what he gave them yesterday.Chicago took a 1-0 lead in the fifth on an Alcantara solo homer, to which Rizzo would add an RBI-double in the last of the sixth. Steve Pearce would smack a homer into the left field grandstand in the seventh inning, which attests for the lone Oriole hit on the day. The fact is that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 achilles heel has been afternoon games, and games against pitchers and teams against whom they have little to no history.

The loss of Machado makes the road a lot tougher for sure. But keep in mind that the O\xe2\x80\x99s do have a winning record without Machado in the lineup this year. Furthermore, even if they don\xe2\x80\x99t make a deal this week for some infield help, rosters will expand one week from today and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to bring some guys up from the minors to help as well.The Birds begin a four-game series at home tonight against Tampa.

08/26/2014,"[('Get to know your Orioles: Brad Brach - Camden Chat', ' Relief pitchers can be some of the most forgettable names on a Major League roster. They are constantly being called up, sent down and designated for assignment. For players drafted in the 42nd round, the chance to be called up even once is a downright impossible dream. Brad Brach has beaten the odds to not only make it to the bigs, but stick on a playoff-contending roster. Name: Brad Brach Number: 35Born: April 12, 1986 (28 years old) in Freehold, NJHeight: 6\'6"" Weight: 215 lbsBats: Right Throws: RightDrafted: by the San Diego Padres in the 42nd round of the 2008 draftSchool: Freehold Township High School (Freehold, NJ)Monmouth University (West Long Branch, NJ)Contract: $509,500 in 2014 (Arbitration Eligible: 2016, Free Agent: 2019)Became an Oriole: Traded on November 25, 2013 by the Padres to the Orioles in exchange for minor league pitcher Devin JonesTwitter: @BradBrach35 Boyhood Fandom Freehold, NJ is about an hour away from the Big Apple. So Brad was raised as a big New York Mets fan. Unfortunately, the Mets kinda stunk when he was a kid (believe me, I understand you, Brad). So, in addition to his squad, he decided to root for the team that would beat the Yankees. If we travel back to the early and mid 90s, that team was the Baltimore Orioles. Brach followed the everyday movement of the O\'s and became a huge Cal Ripken Jr. fan. If you sweep through his twitter feed you can find a picture of\xc2\xa0him and his family at Camden Yards and one of him, horizontally, wearing a Ripken jersey.    ""(Ripken) played hard every single day and was someone I aspired to be like,"" Brach told Padres360.com last year. ""He was an All-Star when I was growing up and was out there every single day.    A World Without Baseball Brach told MLB.com\'s Britt Ghiroli that if he weren\'t fortunate enough to be a big leaguer that he would likely become a teacher. He has a degree from Monmouth University in history education. He would like to get a position at a high school so that he could teach and coach both basketball and baseball. He was named second-team all district in basketball as a high school student. And his profile on the Monmouth University sports page informed us that he amassed 147 rebounds and 86 three-point field goals. I have no clue how good that is but the dude is 6\'6"" so I\'m sure he can play some b-ball.    Friendly Competition The Brach family is pretty into this whole baseball thing. While we all know by now that Brad is major league reliever, it is also of note that his little brother, Brett is a professional baseball player too, kind of. The younger Brach was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 10th round of the 2009 draft after he attended Monmouth like his brother. Unfortunately, things haven\'t gone quite as well for Brett. He has been out of affiliated ball since July 10 when he pitched for the Nationals double-A team, Harrisburg, against the Baysox. The two crossed paths once this season. Brad was down with Norfolk when Brett\'s Columbus Clippers (Indians affiliate) came into town. The teams split the series and Brett never made an appearance. Brad threw 1.2 innings and gave up three runs.    Nashville Party In the offseason, Brach does not return to his childhood home of New Jersey. Nor does he head to Arizona, where his parents now live. He goes to the homeland of country music, Nashville. This is where he owns a house with his wife, Jenae Cherry. The couple met there in August of 2011 when Brad was in Tennessee with the Triple-A Tucson Padres to play the Nashville Sounds. He went out to a little bar where Cherry was strumming her acoustic guitar and crooning to the country tunes. He asked her out to lunch and the rest is history. At one time, Cherry thought she wanted to become a nurse but after one year of school at Northern Illinois University traded her stethoscope for a guitar; a pink guitar. She plays five nights a week in Nashville and Brad is there every night he can be in the off-season. If you want to learn more about Jenae and her music, which I know you do, check out\xc2\xa0her website. There is a piece by MLB.com\'s Corey Brock that is a good introduction to the couple. But if ya don\'t want to, here is the synopsis: They inspire one another, they have a dog; a Dachshund/Lab mix named Belle, and they put up a pink tree at Christmas time. Quick Facts -Favorite food: Pizza or ice cream-Favorite movie: Remember the Titans-Brad has made his own CD. He recorded a rap with two of his friends growing up but he is apparently not very fond of it. He will let his wife be the musically inclined one in the house.-Prized possession: His wife\'s first album (what a nice guy!)-He shares his birthday with Brennan Boesch, Justin Ruggiano and Hisashi Iwakuma-Brach attended the same high school as Val Majewski. Remember him? In 2004 he played in nine games with the Orioles and batted .154. At one point, he was the O\'s fourth best prospect, according the Baseball America. An injury in 2005 derailed his career.-Brach made his Major League debut as a Padre on August 31, 2011 as a 25 year old against he Dodgers. He threw one and on-third inning, striking out three and giving up two hits and one walk but no runs. Current Oriole Nick Hundley also made an appearance in that game as a pinch hitter for San Diego    Overview Very little could have been expected from Brach when he was traded for back in November. He had struggled to stick with San Diego, a team that plays in one of the most pitcher-friendly parks in the game. A switch to the bandbox that is Camden Yards seemed insurmountable. However, his immediate excitement about the move was encouraging. He went right to Twitter to explain how enthralled he was with the chance to be an Oriole and his performance has made fans just as excited to have him. In his last 10 appearances he has allowed two hits, four walks and no runs while striking out 14. He is a bullpen arm. One who is lights out today, may be gone tomorrow, but he seems like one of the good guys in the game and I\'m happy to have him.

The lovable losers of the north side of Chicago \xe2\x80\x93 the Cubs \xe2\x80\x93 took a three-game series from the Orioles with relative ease. So let me explain why it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter much:History. The Orioles were only playing their second series ever at Wrigley Field in the 100 years history of the iconic ballpark. Sure some of the players had played there before, such as Nelson Cruz (who played there last year with the Rangers) and Steve Pearce (with the Pirates). But the team seemed to be intimidated by the small bandbox. The bullpen is practically in the field of play, fans are right on top of the players and the place really seems to be a stadium out of time.

Throw in the erratic Pedro Strop and the Orioles were just not welcomed by their old teammates.Long Road series. It was a long time to be away from home. First Cleveland, then a week in Chicago playing in two different stadiums. It certainly had to make the team homesick near the end.

08/27/2014,"[('Manny Machado knee injury: Surgery a success, \\u2026', "" The Orioles announced on Wednesday afternoon that the surgery on Manny Machado's right knee was successful. Manager Buck Showalter told O's reporters in his pre-game comments that the timetable is such that Machado is expected to be fully available for spring training. Machado suffered the injury in the process of swinging during an at-bat in a game on August 11. The injury was diagnosed as a partly torn ligament in his right knee. He returned to the same surgeon who operated on his other knee last October, Los Angeles-based Dr. Neal ElAttrache. The procedure was expected to be much the same, including a correction of an abnormality in Machado's knee that was present in his left knee. Wednesday as the ligament was addressed, they worked on the abnormality as well. Showalter told reporters that Machado will spend three weeks in Los Angeles following the surgery. After that, he'll either head to Sarasota or join up with the Orioles to get his rehab started. When Machado got his surgery done last October, both he and the Orioles maintained that he would be back for spring training and the regular season, which did not quite end up happening. There are two big differences this time around. The ligament is not fully torn, and even if the surgery has the same recovery time, Machado has gotten the surgery six weeks sooner this calendar year.    This season, Machado made his return to the MLB team on May 1. He didn't start getting hot at the plate until the end of June, although whether that was connected to either needing to fully recover or missing out on spring training as a chance to get back to game speed is not something we can know. At the very least, if it takes the same amount of time for him to play again, he'd have about two weeks of spring training to get up to speed in 2015. If the partial tear shortens the recovery time, he should get most or all of spring training. However far the Orioles get in the 2014 season, they'll have to get there without Machado.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAfter a long road trip, the Baltimore Orioles are so glad to be at home that they pulled out a 4-2 victory over the Rays by getting three outs at home!Did you follow that?If you were able to watch the whole game on Tuesday night, you were able to see three of the best plays at home plate by a catcher as could be imagined in a single game. Caleb Joseph has had an amazing season defensively for the Orioles since he joined the team upon the season-ending injury to Matt Wieters.The three plays to Joseph were:In the first inning \xe2\x80\x93 a 5-3-2 play from Chris Davis to Steve Pearce on a ground ball while Desmond Jennings attempted to take home on the throw. It was a very close play, but the throw and tag were flawless, as was Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s positioning at the plate.In the second inning \xe2\x80\x93 an 8-2 play, as Ryan Hanigan attempted to score from second base on a two-out single by Desmond Jennings. Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 low bouncing throw came right to Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s glove on the sliding Hanigan.In the seventh inning \xe2\x80\x93 a 5-2 play with a bare-handed grab by Chris Davis of a slow bounder toward third. Joseph short-hopped the catch for a bases-loaded force out.But not only did Caleb Joseph protect home, he brought home the first two Orioles runs in the fourth inning with a line drive to center field that just barely fell in. With two outs, this was a huge hit, putting the O\xe2\x80\x99s ahead 2-1. \xc2\xa0The Orioles are 14-1 when Joseph has an RBI in a game.And again in the bottom of the sixth inning (and again) with two outs and Chris Davis on first base, Caleb Joseph extended the inning with a solid single. This too proved to be a big hit, keeping the inning going for Jonathan Schoop to follow with another single to drive in the tie-breaking run that would prove to be the game-winner.This sixth-inning damage was done off Grant Balfour, who was the eventual losing pitcher. He is now 1-6 with a 5.54 ERA.\xc2\xa0 Remember when Dan Duquette and the Warehouse were criticized for not signing Balfour. Instead it was a relative no-name like Brad Brach who ended up in the O\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen \xe2\x80\x93 where tonight he improved his record to 5-0 with a 2.47 ERA.Though a big win for the Orioles who pick up a game on the Yankees, it was a deliberative, methodical, and even tedious game that lasted 3.5 hours. Each team ran lots of deep counts and extended at-bats. Rays starter Alex Cobb was out of the game after four innings, having already thrown 92 pitches. Wei-Yin Chen also had command troubles, though he pitched out of a lot of trouble on an evening he did not have his best stuff.Game three of the four-game series will continue on Wednesday night with Kevin Gausman going against Drew Smyly.This will be Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s 15th start of the year. He is 7-5 with a 3.81 ERA. He pitched two games against the Rays in late June with opposite results \xe2\x80\x93 winning one by giving up no runs in six innings, while getting hit hard on the second occasion with five runs on seven hits in five innings.Combined between Detroit and Tampa Bay, Smyly is 8-10 with a 3.42 ERA. Two of his eight wins this year are against the Orioles. The first of these was through three scoreless innings of middle relief in the third game of the year for the Tigers.

In their previous two Sunday Night Baseball games this season, the Orioles have gone 1-1, losing a barf-worthy walk-off in Boston on April 20 and winning a rain-shortened five inning game on July 13 against the Yankees. Can we get on ESPN on a Sunday night without either the Yankees or the Red Sox being involved? Apparently not.     "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Problems with good pitching', 'As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all season long, good pitching will generally shut down good hitting. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it all season long, and it\xe2\x80\x99s generally been the case since the beginning of time in baseball. We saw it again last night with the Baltimore Orioles, as they fell 3-1 to Tampa \xe2\x80\x93 who\xe2\x80\x99s starter Drew Smyly seemed to dominate the Orioles and in effect shut down everything they tried to do. The issue of course is that once they get into the postseason, the Birds will be seeing that caliber of pitching in every game.Kevin Gausman was done in by a 34 pitch first inning, in which he yielded two runs. In typical Tampa style, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t hit the ball hard, or too far (for the most part). And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of what frustrates teams about Tampa overall; it\xe2\x80\x99s almost more acceptable to lose to a team that\xe2\x80\x99s tagging pitch after pitch. But when you lose to guys who are just barely getting dropping the ball over the infielders\xe2\x80\x99 heads for base hits, it\xe2\x80\x99s borderline embarrassing. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4 IP, 6 H, 3 R (2 earned) 0 BB, 4 K. Again, the 34 pitch first inning was the key for Gausman, who after the game insisted that he\xe2\x80\x99s not starting to tire.  And I would tend to agree with him; as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s hitters wear out your pitching with the number of times they foul pitches off, take pitches, and just hack at balls just to stay alive. (In turn, their pitchers seem to wear out your hitters when they\xe2\x80\x99re at the plate.)Tampa scored in the first inning when Matt Joyce grounded to Jonathan Schoop with Ben Zobrist on third. Schoop, I suppose recalling howCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsoften Tampa runners had already been nailed at the plate in this series, opted to throw home instead of taking the sure out at first base. Zobrist slid in under Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x98s tag, giving Tampa a 1-0 lead. That\xe2\x80\x99s a rookie mistake on Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s part, as eventually he\xe2\x80\x99ll learn that you can\xe2\x80\x99t try to force plays as such. Evan Longoria followed suit with a single, as did James Loney\xe2\x80\xa6at which point Longoria returned the favor with a bone headed play of his own. On Myers\xe2\x80\x99 single Tampa held their runners as as not to test Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x98 arm. Longoria apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the memo, and was tagged out at third base \xe2\x80\x93 where of course Joyce was already standing. Will Myers would add an RBI-single before the innnig was over to give Tampa a 2-0 lead, which an inning later would run to 3-1 on a Ben Zorist sac fly-RBI.The lone Oriole run came on a Chris Davis line drive homer in the last of the second, which also closed out the scoring for the day overall. So you can look at it from the perspective that a bad two innings did Gausman and the Orioles in. And when you produce the caliber of pitching that Tampa seems to produce, you can afford to take the attitude that in scoring one run that means the other side has to score two to beat you. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re a frustrating team to play.The series concludes tonight at 7 PM with Bud Norris on the hill for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s Jeremy Hellickson. The good news for the O\xe2\x80\x99s is that New York plays at 1 PM today, so they\xe2\x80\x99ll already know the result of that game going in. For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, New York will head to Toronto for the weekend, while the O\xe2\x80\x99s will welcome in Minnesota. Prior to the game the Orioles sent Wei-Yin Chen down to the Gulf Coast Orioles, and recalled catcher Steve Clevenger from Norfolk. Chen will be eligible to be recalled on September 1st when rosters expand, so call this merely a move on paper. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Possible September call-ups for the Orioles - Camden Chat', "" September is right around the corner, and the last month of regular season baseball is played under a different set of rules from the first five. In September, the O's can have anyone on the 40-man roster active for the games, instead of just 25 on the active roster. Any player on the 40-man roster who are currently not on the active roster could join the team in September barring any injury, even though they would almost definitely serve as the reserves of the reserves. Which of them can the O's expect to contribute in September and possibly in the playoffs? Scanning the O's 40-man roster, the standout among the group is definitely Ryan Webb, who has been banished to the minors since Andrew Miller's arrival. The other possible contributors have not been in the majors as much as Webb has, so here is a list of those who have performed well in the minors this season and who can hopefully provide a boost for the O's. Jemile Weeks made a brief appearance with the O's in April that lasted a grand total of three games. Weeks has spent the majority of the season at AAA, where he has combined a low strikeout rate with a high walk rate for an OBP of .391. The power has been predictably lacking, and his SLG is only one point higher than his OBP. But the overall package is a wRC+ 122 hitter in the minors. As Jonathan Schoop has continued to struggle at the plate, there is definitely an opportunity for Weeks to gain some playing time at second base, especially against right-handers. The injury to Manny Machado also presents another lineup in which Weeks can start. Schoop can move to third, while Chris Davis, Steve Pearce and Nelson Cruz return to their natural positions. This lineup would be a huge upgrade defensively over the current lineup, though it may sacrifice an equal amount offensively. Even though Steve Clevenger was called up yesterday, I am still considering him a September call-up. As\xc2\xa0I have mentioned before, Clevenger's biggest advantage over Caleb Joseph or Nick Hundley is the side of the plate he bats from. While Joseph has broken out offensively (relatively), Hundley has remained dismal from the plate. Meanwhile, Clevenger has also cooled down considerably in AAA. His triple slash line now stands at .305/.366/.389, down from .393/.433/.525 two months ago. However, he is still likely a better hitter against right-handed pitchers than both Joseph and Hundley. While Joseph's offensive and defensive breakout has more than earned him the job as the primary catcher, I would much rather see Clevenger's name in the lineup when Joseph takes a rest.    Preston Guilmet has made several appearances with the O's this season. This is understandable given that he has struck out 27.4% of the batters he faced and only walked 5.4% of them in 45 innings in AAA. Unlike Weeks and Clevenger, Guilmet would not have anything close to a crucial role in the majors due to the depth of the bullpen. There are at least five names above him when it comes to high leverage situation. Despite this, there is never a problem with too much bullpen depth, and Guilmet adds to the O's strength. Finally, there is former Oriole Joe Saunders. Signed to a minor-league contract at the beginning of August, Saunders has been working in relief in Norfolk for the first time in his career. He could really help the team against lefties out of the bullpen, as he has always had a very good platoon split against them even in years when he wasn't a very effective starting pitcher. I am leaving out Evan Meek's performance for the fear that Buck would put him in a tied game in the ninth inning if called up. For the rest of the group, I hope that they take on larger roles than typical September call-ups, and that may not be a bad thing for the O's.

The Orioles defeated the Rays 9-1. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWhat will it take for the Baltimore Orioles, or any other team for that matter, to win it all? The answer to this question can be defined in sabermetrical terms, though I want to speak of it more generically and defer most of the statistics for analysis at another time.To win short series we know it takes good starting pitching, timely hitting, and shut-down bullpens. But even some of the best teams with rosters brimming with players such as these will sometimes not breeze through to championships.What is needed is for a majority of players on a team to be performing at the top of, or above, their historic statistical average level of play.Look at the 2013 Red Sox. It was a nice roster, though certainly it was not one that would have been selected by many to have the season that they put together, culminating in the World Series Championship. But a number of the players had career years, and they cumulatively put together a strong effort toward the end of the season.This is true when looking back at each of the past four World Series champions, examining the records over their final 20 and 30 games of the regular season \xe2\x80\xa6TEAM\xc2\xa0 Final 20 Games \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Final 30 Games2013 Red Sox\xc2\xa0 12-8\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa020-102012 Giants\xc2\xa0 14-6\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa020-102011 Cardinals\xc2\xa0 15-5\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa021-92010 Giants\xc2\xa0 12-8\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa020-10\xc2\xa0Can the Baltimore Orioles be a team like this? They actually have been for some time now. Over the past 20 games they are 14-6, and over they have a record of 33-17 over the past 50 games. But the O\xe2\x80\x99s are going to need to sustain this pace and not simply limp home with a narrow divisional title.And are the Orioles a squad with a strong majority of players performing at the top of their historic mid-range performance, or even definitely above average? Let\xe2\x80\x99s think it through\xe2\x80\xa6Starting Pitching \xe2\x80\x93 It is certainly true that, particularly over the past two months, the starting pitchers have performed above the level of their historic numbers. Chris Tillman is now throwing at a level equal to his best season last year. Miguel Gonzalez, Budd Norris, and Wei-Yin Chen are generally all pitching somewhat above historic norms. Of course, Ubaldo Jimenez is another story altogether, and Kevin Gausman is essentially learning on the job.Relief Pitching \xe2\x80\x93 Without doubt, the bullpen is performing at an extremely high level. Exceptions might be Tommy Hunter and Brian Matusz, though they are not regular liabilities. Brad Brach and T.J. McFarland have given some very effective length and bridged the gap from a weak start on many occasions. And Andrew Miller, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, and Zach Britton are throwing at the very best levels of their respective careers. This bullpen has not been overused, nor will they now be with the addition of arms in the expanded rosters.Hitting \xe2\x80\x93 It is hit and miss (get it?). Yes, way too many misses in several situations. How many Orioles hitters are having career years? Steve Pearce is for sure. Can you name another? Producing in line with historic numbers would be Adam Jones, Nick Markakis, J.J. Hardy, and Delmon Young when he plays. I did not include Nelson Cruz. He had a career first half of the season, and it likely saved the Orioles from early destruction; but he has not hit anywhere near his historic average for many weeks now. Not to dump on Chris Davis, but even a .250 average over the rest of 2014 would make a huge difference in what has been a precipitous drop-off from 2013. And we can put Jonathan Schoop and Caleb Joseph in the same category as Gausman in terms of learning on the job. \xc2\xa0 More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterThough no one can predict the future with certainty, there is reason to believe that the total pitching component of the Orioles will stay competitive through to the final game.

A lefty batter, Johnson has a .212/.290/.354 slash line over 87 games this season. Over his career, he hasn't displayed much of a platoon split, although he's actually hitting lefties better this year than righties. Also, even that bad batting line is better than Ryan Flaherty has done this year. It's another move of tinkering on the margins for Duquette. Since he has been acquired before September 1, Johnson will be eligible for the Orioles postseason roster, should they make it into the postseason.    Almanzar was selected by the Orioles over the winter in the Rule 5 draft. He spent a couple of months on the disabled list with a knee injury, but the Orioles had to return him to the Red Sox when they activated him and didn't have room for him on the 25-man roster. Weeks made it into three games for the Orioles but spent most of his time in Norfolk after being traded for Jim Johnson over the offseason. We'll always remember that triple. As Weeks was on the 40-man roster, this is a 40-man neutral move, but the Orioles will need to send someone off the 25-man roster for a couple of days if Kelly Johnson is active for Sunday's game. DeJesus Jr. played shortstop for Norfolk and you probably have no reason to think about him unless you are related to him.     "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Tampa Bay Rays defeated Baltimore Orioles 3-1. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAs the Orioles close-in on the postseason, standing eight games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees in the AL East, here are three keys to this team maximizing their potential and making a deep playoff run.Starting PitchingSince the All-Star Break, Orioles starting pitchers have posted a 3.28 ERA, good enough for sixth-best in the American League. Before the break, starters pitched to a 4.09 ERA, which was 11th in the league. The Orioles record before the All-Star Break was 52-42 (.553). After the break it was 26-14 (.650). Coincidence? Probably not.For the Orioles to have success in the playoffs, starters like Chris Tillman, Wei-Yin Chen, and Bud Norris must continue to give the Orioles a chance to win in every game. There are no Felix Hernandez or Clayton Kershaw-esque talents on this team, so winning a 1-0 game is unlikely. However, if Orioles pitchers can keep the team competitive, allowing the bats to make the difference and win the game with four or five runs, they would be doing an adequate job.Steve PearceSteve Pearce has become a key player for the Orioles as injuries and lack of production on the field have forced him into the lineup at various points this season. With the most recent injury to Manny Machado, Pearce and slugger Chris Davis have shouldered the biggest responsibility for picking up the slack the superstar talent has left. With Davis moving to third to fill-in for Machado, Pearce has played an impressive first base, picking balls out of the dirt and making more than just routine plays. Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s bat has also been one of the best on the team in the last 30 days, leading active Orioles in OPS (.928). An MRI revealed yesterday that an injury to Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s midsection is not serious and he is considered day-to-day after missing Saturday and Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s games.BullpenThe Baltimore bullpen has been one of the best pieces of the Oriole machine this year, despite some shaky ninth performances before Zach Britton was named the closer. Oriole relievers have pitched 427 innings before today\xe2\x80\x99s game, eighth most in the majors. Their ERA is 3.03, which is also eighth in the majors. However, some of the individual pieces are what makes this unit special. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day has the second-best ERA (0.91) of any MLB reliever who has pitched more than 20 innings. Zach Britton also maintains a ridiculously low ERA (1.92), has logged more than 30 saves, and induces ground balls at a 77% rate. With tools like O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Britton, as well as longman Brad Brach and big lefty Andrew Miller, there are several capable pitchers the Orioles can turn to to help win closely contested, high-intensity playoff games.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt is a beautiful thing to wake up on Labor Day, September 1st, and see the Baltimore Orioles leading the American League East by nine games! Even if nothing else goes well today, there is that!On Sunday afternoon, the Baltimore Orioles produced what is probably their second-best offensive-explosion game of the season, scoring 12 runs against the Minnesota Twins on a total of 18 base hits in a 12-8 victory. Back on April 8th against the Yankees, the Orioles tallied 14 runs on 20 hits. Just three weeks ago the O\xe2\x80\x99s had another 12-run game against the Cardinals, though with only 15 hits.All nine batters in the Baltimore Orioles lineup contributed at least one hit, with Caleb Joseph accounting for four hits personally. Nick Markakis and David Lough had three hits apiece.But the bulk of the Orioles scoring came on the home run, as it so often does. Nelson Cruz scored the first run of the game with a solo shot, and Ryan Flaherty followed with a three-run homer onto the flag court.\xc2\xa0 And J.J. Hardy appeared at the time to have broken open the game with a grand slam that was part of a seven-run sixth inning that opened to an11-2 lead.But it was simply a hitters\xe2\x80\x99 day, and the Orioles bullpen had an uncharacteristic meltdown. The Twins put together a total of six runs over the last three innings, even loading the bases and requiring the fire extinguishing talents of Zach Britton to get the final out\xe2\x80\x94one that represented the tying run.

Well, they can add more to that after Sunday, gaining six runs to only one from the Orioles.One would think that such a large lead would be safe in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s hands, even Ubaldo Jimenez. But coming on in relief and pitching just one-third of an inning, he set the forest ablaze with three walks and a hit. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve written before, he makes \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Chaos\xe2\x80\x9d Kevin Gregg look like a precision pitcher.Where can Ubaldo be safely used?\xc2\xa0 Probably only in a game where the O\xe2\x80\x99s have already been blown out, and that practically never happens. I\xe2\x80\x99d say to just shut it down, try to address it in the calm of the offseason, and then come back next year as a different person.The win leaves the Orioles with an incredible record of 79-56 and on pace to win 95 games. August was a great month for the O\xe2\x80\x99s as they finished it 19-9. During July they were just as good at 17-8 (June \xe2\x80\x93 16-12). In the month of August, the Orioles outscored their opponents 135 to 87. \xc2\xa0 This winning summer of baseball is what it felt like to be an O\xe2\x80\x99s fan in 1969-1971The win percentages of July and August are reminiscent of the pace of wins enjoyed by the great Baltimore Orioles teams of 1969-1971. This is what it felt like to be an O\xe2\x80\x99s fan at that time. But our more recent comparison and memory is to 2012. On the first of September just two years ago, the Orioles were 73-58. Of course, they would go 20-11 from that point to the end of the season.Also reminiscent of the 2012 Orioles is the way that new and unheralded players step in and get critical hits. The first person to come to mind from the past is Taylor Teagarden\xe2\x80\x94whose average was very anemic, but who got all of his RBIs when most needed.We are seeing that again in this season\xe2\x80\xa6 like Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s home run Sunday, the contributions of Jimmy Paredes over the past three games, David Lough getting a start and tallying three hits in the two hole, and the continued contributions of Caleb Joseph.One could almost bet that when Alejandro De Aza and Kelly Johnson step into their first Orioles game they are going to do something game-changing.

Photo: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt was one of the most unconventional ways the Baltimore Orioles have ever begun or ended a game, but it got the job done. Coming on a night of a Yankee loss to Boston, last night\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0win \xe2\x80\x93 which got more interesting than anybody cared\xc2\xa0to see it get \xe2\x80\x93 pushed the lead over the Yankees to 9 1/2 games and reduced the Magic Number to 17. That is, if you like thinking about magic numbers this early.Tonight, the Orioles got enough runs quickly and were able to hold on. But even in the process of going 23 games over .500 and having the largest lead of any division leader in baseball, concerns have cropped up. Even in the process of trading for Alejandro De Aza, and adding more speed to the postseason roster in the person of Quintin Berry and Jimmy Paredes, third base has already started to revert to the pre-Manny days of sticking out like a sore thumb. The left field situation is similar.Paredes, even though his bat provided a huge boost in Saturday night\xe2\x80\x99s win, has rough edges in his defensive game. Kelly Johnson, who also arrived in the De Aza trade,\xc2\xa0asked to play third\xc2\xa0late in tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game, also let one get by. The furthest thing from anybody\xe2\x80\x99s mind was that\xc2\xa0any backup third baseman would be in Machado\xe2\x80\x99s league defensively. The deals made at the trade deadline and the September call-ups have added depth at all the infield positions.But it is a defensive dropoff, and that results in an opposing hit that should have been an out, a baserunner who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been there, a runner on second or third who should have been held at first, more pitches needed to get out of an inning, an early exit for the starter, and a fried bullpen. It\xe2\x80\x99s the reason Andrew Miller was acquired\xc2\xa0for late-inning relief\xc2\xa0help.Little things add up, and it could cost a game here or thereBut it\xe2\x80\x99s living the old way. It led indirectly to Jay Bruce\xe2\x80\x98s grand slam off Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day in the 8th inning last night, even though Zach Britton held the fort after that.Little things add up, and that has the potential to cost a game here or there, show up in the won-lost record, and\xc2\xa0translate into losing home field to the L.A. Angels \xe2\x80\x94 or just losing the playoffs and seeing the dream season end.Until then, don\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s stupid to watch the dream keep unfolding. I\xe2\x80\x99m just pointing to warning signs. The Orioles are 80-57, the only team other than the Angels with 80 or more victories. There are 25 games left, and going only 15-10 gets them to 95. It continues to astonish me the Orioles have achieved what\xc2\xa0they have without Wieters, without Machado for chunks of the year, including the rest of it, and with Chris Davis hitting well under .200 since late July.When Steve Pearce comes back from his strained\xc2\xa0abdominal muscle, he goes back to first base, returning Davis to third, which had\xc2\xa0recently started to look like an acceptable arrangement. Having to live like\xc2\xa0that the rest of the way might\xc2\xa0mean not having to look away from the screen\xc2\xa0when grounders are hit to third.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsA second inning solo home run by Jonathan Schoop with the Baltimore Orioles leading 4-0 proved to be the winning run in what was a 5-4 victory for the O\xe2\x80\x99s over the Cincinnati Reds.But Schoop not only damaged the Reds with his bat, he made three terrific defensive plays to keep Cincinnati from gaining additional scores, particularly on the final play of the game.After a two-hour rain delay, the Baltimore Orioles came to bat in the bottom of the first inning and did something we seldom see from this team: they strung together a series of five singles to score four runs.After Nick Markakis AGAIN led off a game with a single, the new Oriole in the lineup\xe2\x80\x94Alejandro De Aza\xe2\x80\x94would get an infield hit to put the first two runners on base. They were followed by RBI singles by Nelson Cruz, Chris Davis, and Caleb Joseph. Jimmy Paredes also knocked in a run on a groundout in that sequence.If I had told you even a month ago that De Aza would be in left field and Paredes at third base for the Orioles in September, would you have believed it? But again, even as predicted yesterday in this blog, a Dan Duquette acquisition would come through in his first game with critical hits. De Aza would get a second hit in the fifth inning, but would be caught attempting to steal third base.Bud Norris and the Orioles seemed fully in control of this game. Norris had excellent stuff with all his pitches and gave up zero runs in six innings. But it again, as in recent days, was the bullpen who demonstrated some signs of rough edges. The incredible and unhittable Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day allowed the bases loaded in the top of the eighth inning on a walk, throwing error on Paredes, and HBP. This brought Jay Bruce to the plate and a grand slam that made the pending laugher into a one-run game.In giving up four runs (three earned) in two-thirds of an inning, O\xe2\x80\x99Day saw his ERA go from 0.91 to 1.34. This is why a somewhat high ERA of a reliever doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always tell everything. One or two bad days can blow it up in a hurry\xe2\x80\xa6 not that 1.34 is blown up.But the excitement wasn\xe2\x80\x99t over. Zach Britton got the first out, but then gave up a double to Ramon Santiago. And an infield chopper by Billy Hamilton put runners on the corner. Todd Frazier then hit a hard ground ball to Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s glove-side, where he tagged Hamilton and threw to first for the double play \xe2\x80\xa6 game over. Earlier, Schoop had made a diving stop and throw to first to rob Frazier of a single; and he also made a great running catch behind first base. Schoop really was the difference-maker on this evening.If I were a Cincinnati Reds writer rather than an Orioles blogger and editor, I would be coming out of my skin about the stupid base-running play in the ninth inning by Billy Hamilton. To simply run into the second baseman fielding the ball is to literally run into a double play. Yes, he attempted to avoid the tag \xe2\x80\x93 unsuccessfully \xe2\x80\x93 which is the way it always is if the fielder is in the direct line of the basepath. Here is the play\xe2\x80\xa6The correct play for the baserunner at that point is to stop dead in his tracks. This makes the second baseman either come and tag him, and thus fail to get the runner at first; or if the infielder throws to first, the runner can likely gain second base before the throw and tag.On this evening, it disallowed the tying run to score and gave the win to the Orioles. Thank you Mr. Hamilton, though a professional player should know the game better than that; but he is not the first I have seen make this blunder.The victory gives the Orioles a 9.5-game advantage over the Yankees who lost to the Red Sox 9-4 on Tuesday night. At 70-66, the Yankees might have a better chance of finishing below .500 than catching the Birds.In the MASN postgame program\xe2\x80\x94probably missed by most folks who had to be in bed\xe2\x80\x94a statistical graphic was displayed that illustrated how all five O\xe2\x80\x99s starters are under an ERA of 4.00.\xc2\xa0 The last time this was true for the Orioles in the month of September was 1984!\xc2\xa0 That is an amazing stat.Game two of the series, and game 10 of the homestand (now 7-2), begins tonight at 7:05 with the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Miguel Gonzalez (7-7, 3.61) going against Dylan Axelrod (0-1, 1.64).

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWith their impressive win last night the Orioles move to 81-57 and 9.5 games up on the second-place New York Yankees in the American League East. Now just two games behind the Angels with just 24 games remaining, the Orioles primary focus for the rest of the regular season will be finishing with the best record in the American League and earning home field advantage through the ALCS. However, Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter will have some interesting roster decisions to make come October, particularly in the starting rotation. Although they would never say it, the rest of September will partially be used to help shape how the starting rotation will be lined up going into the playoffs. How effective or ineffective each starter is in their remaining 3 or 4 starts could determine their role in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first playoff series. There is no doubt any post season rotation will include Chris Tillman, Miguel Gonzalez and Wei-Yin Chen. The only question will be in which order. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to consider when laying out the rotation for the post season. The first could just come down to who is on normal rest. Also, who the Orioles play and whether or not they have home field advantage. Even the time of the game could factor into the decision.However, there is something special about pitching the first game of the post season, and its obvious Buck will want to go with his hottest hand. With his performance last night, Miguel Gonzalez is doing his part to get the nod. Gonzalez may have pitched the best game of his career going all nine innings and allowing only five base runners for his first career shutout. However, it was no fluke. Since June he has allowed more than 3 runs only once, and has failed to go at least 6 innings only once. Chris Tillman was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 opening day starter, and would be the obvious choice to start game one in any playoff series. He has also had an impressive recent stretch. Tillman hasn\xe2\x80\x99t given up more than three runs since June 5, that\xe2\x80\x99s a 16 game span. He also gave up a ridiculous 6 runs in 6 starts in August. While Tillman and Gonzalez have been impressive of late, it\xe2\x80\x99s Wei-Yin Chen that has been the most reliable pitcher all season. He has failed to go at least 5 innings only twice all season, and currently leads the team with 14 wins. He has also only walked 28 in his 26 starts this season. Back of the rotation starters Kevin Gausman and Bud Norris could have their roles dependent on the playoff schedule, and what the series score is heading into the fourth and fifth game. If the Orioles are down going into the fourth game, they may choose to stick to a three-man rotation and use Norris and Gausman out of the bullpen. The Orioles could use a three-man rotation throughout the playoffs. However, over their careers both Gonzalez and Chen have seemed to benefit from more extra rest in between starts. So off days and travel schedule could dictate how often Buck wants to use them. It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to note that all five starters could be over or near their career highs in innings pitched going into October.There are a lot of factors that go into the how to set up a playoff starting rotation, and the Orioles will have some tough decisions to make. However, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t a lot or any managers in baseball that are as prepared as Buck Showalter, and there is no doubt he will have his players in the best position to win.

Actually the Orioles are not just good, they are incredibly great. Never before has a team relied so heavily on the long ball and has seen as much success as the Orioles are having. The question is: How are they doing this?Other than Nelson Cruz, nobody in the lineup is leading the Majors in any batting category. And despite the starting pitching lacking a Clayton Kershaw or Felix Hernandez, the Orioles starters still give their team the best chance to win. To put it in blatant terms, the Orioles just work well as a unit.Like the city of Baltimore that sometimes has a underdog mentality, this team performs at a high level and continues to win games despite what the critics at ESPN and MLB Network say. By doing this, they are not only running away with the American League East, they are arguably the best team in baseball.For as long as I could remember, the Baltimore Orioles had trouble scoring runs; their pitching was horrendous; and it would be considered a good year when the team reached the 70-win mark.Then some point along the line, something changed. Since 2012, this team has slowly but surely changed the entire demeanor of this team and city. The Orioles are no longer the laughing stock of the Majors; rather they are doing the laughing with the largest division lead in all of baseball.Some would say the hiring of Dan Duquette was the leading cause for the Orioles success. Others would say it was the hiring of Buck Showalter. For me, it was the changing of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 logo back to the cartoon bird.In 1998, the year after the Orioles won their last division title, the Orioles changed their logo for the fourth in the ball club\xe2\x80\x99s history. The team decided to change the bird on their hats and helmets to more of a \xe2\x80\x9clifelike\xe2\x80\x9d bird from the ornithologically correct bird. During the 14 years of the bird sitting atop the players hats and helmets, the Orioles not only never made it to the playoffs but they also never hit the 80-win mark.\xc2\xa0Then in November of 2011, the Orioles announced they would be bringing back the cartoon bird to the Orioles uniform. This is the same bird that graced the team\xe2\x80\x99s uniforms when they won the World Series in 1966, 1970, and 1983. With the new bird on their caps, the team immediately saw improvements. In 2012 and 2013, the team won 93 and 85 games games respectively. And if things keep going the way they are this season, the Orioles will reach the playoffs for the second time in three years.I am not saying the old logo was ugly, but with how this team is performing in the past three years, I would keep this cartoon bird around for a while. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Have the Orioles gotten another top 10 MVP season from ...', "" The Orioles have not had someone win the Most Valuable Player award since Cal Ripken did so for a second time in 1991. As long as Mike Trout is ensconced in Anaheim, doing Mike Trout things, it's not looking like there will be another MVP brought to Baltimore, or at least not this year. Still, even knowing they are not going to win, it's nice as an Orioles fan when the team's best players are recognized farther down the ballot. In the losing years of 1998 to 2011, the O's only had one top 10 MVP finisher: Miguel Tejada's fifth place finish in 2004. Since Cal's win in 1991, the Orioles have only had eight players come in the top 10 of MVP voting. Three of those came within the last two seasons. When Adam Jones placed sixth in the 2012 voting and when Chris Davis came in third place while Manny Machado finished ninth last year, these were great moments, more signs that things were getting better for the franchise after so many dark, lost years. There's still nearly a full month of baseball left to be played, but the contours of that race can be seen. Will Jones or any other Oriole find their way into the top ten this year? As things stand before Wednesday's games, it's looking like Jones is the only Oriole with a chance to place so high. Currently, Jones sits eighth among AL position players with a 4.8 Fangraphs Wins Above Replacement (fWAR), which isn't a perfect measurement of a player's value, but it's not a bad starting point for discussion.    The next highest Oriole is Steve Pearce, who remarkably has 3.8 fWAR in only 85 games played. A player with such little playing time is probably not going to get any serious consideration. J.J. Hardy, with 3.4 fWAR, is #23 among qualifying batters, also probably not enough to get him anywhere near the top 10. He should get another Gold Glove to add to his collection, though.        Jones is good, if not great, at all facets of baseball - except for taking a walk.  Through 137 games, Jones has a batting line of .284/.318/.468, a respectably above-average line that nonetheless leaves him shy of the upper echelon of hitters in the league. His 24 home runs through Tuesday's games are 10th in the AL, and for those who get excited about RBI (which includes many BBWAA voters), Jones' 81 are only good for 13th. Fangraphs rates him at +4.9 runs on the basepaths, eighth in the AL, and +9 runs of defensive value, which is 14th in the AL. One big difference for Jones compared to past years is that he is rated positively for defense. Whether that's actual evidence of improvement or just of the mercurial nature of defensive statistics, we can't say. But, the idea of Jones doing better defensively does pass the eye test based on what we've seen this year. He is good, if not great, out there. Jones is good if not great at all facets of baseball except for taking a walk. He does all of this while playing center field, one of the crucial up the middle positions on the diamond.    As the best player for a team that could win its division, Jones would benefit from that kind of narrative. That may be enough, if he doesn't crater over the last month of the season, to place him in the 6th-8th place range. Though Jones is eighth among position players, there are pitchers to consider, too. Hurlers like Felix Hernandez, Jon Lester, and Corey Kluber are all in the midst of great seasons that are worthy of recognition. It's a bit harder for pitchers to get MVP recognition, almost like some voters consider the Cy Young the pitchers version of MVP. Among those, probably only Hernandez will contend for a top 10 spot. The seven position players ahead of Jones through Tuesday's games: Trout, Alex Gordon, Josh Donaldson, Robinson Cano, Kyle Seager, Michael Brantley, Jose Abreu. The four players behind him, who round out a top 12: Adrian Beltre, Ben Zobrist, Ian Kinsler, Jose Bautista. Players like Detroit's Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez, defensive liabilities who are having good offensive seasons on a possible playoff team, may also wind up in the mix.    Trout, Donaldson, and Cano are all players who are having great seasons for possible playoff teams, and they've all been recognized as top 10 MVP candidates in recent years as well. A good way for everyone to recognize you for being good is if they already recognized you for being good. Baseball awards are not unlike the Emmy's in that way.    Another good way is by having a good story to go along with playing well. Gordon's exact value is debatable given that his position on the WAR list is heavily influenced by a large amount of defensive value, but one thing he has going for him regardless is being the best player on a resurgent Royals team that's contending beyond anyone's preseason expectations. This is the kind of thing that powered Jones to a sixth place finish two years ago. Abreu, the rookie Cuban slugger sensation, also has a great story going for him, slugging over .600 in his first full MLB season. He is almost certainly the Rookie of the Year and he also deserves to be high up in the MVP consideration. In a just universe - which this one is not always - that's probably your top five. Or should Seager, with his 21 home runs (more than teammate Cano) and better defensive metrics, supplant one of these? The Mariners could be a good enough team to warrant two players in the top five or six. The last of those ahead of Jones is Brantley of the Cleveland Indians, who has put up a .311/.371/.495 batting line in a strong effort for a decent Indians team that went into Wednesday's games five back of the second wild card spot. Add in 17 stolen bases against only one caught stealing and that's probably another player who is ahead of Jones, if the voters remember Cleveland exists. It's hard to predict the BBWAA. This is the same body that, through its voting, made the straight-faced assertion that Cabrera was more valuable than Trout over the past two seasons, and that Derek Jeter was the seventh-most valuable player in the AL in 2012. You never really know with them.    On Wednesday's MASN broadcast, Gary Thorne even tossed out teammate Nelson Cruz as a player who should get consideration on the strength of his career-high 36 home runs. An .840 OPS for a DH-type isn't going to cut it for MVP, not even in the diminished offensive environment of 2014. Or at least, it shouldn't, just like Cabrera's .869 OPS shouldn't get him very far. The BBWAA voters do love RBI, though. Through Tuesday's games, Cruz had 91, with Cabrera at 94, both top five in the AL. Is anyone below Jones in fWAR going to jump up and pass him? Based on past years, we can guess that those who are near Jones in fWAR who are based heavily on defense and the positional adjustment - Zobrist and Kinsler - will probably not be leapfrogging him. Those players have yet to get much down-ballot attention for so-so offense and good defense at second base.     The Orioles are lucky to have Jones. Orioles fans are lucky he's on our favorite team.  The likes of Beltre and Bautista have both produced significantly more offense than Jones. Bautista's OPS is fourth-best in the AL, while Beltre's is sixth-best. Offense often equals value to those voters, but it's often only offense on a playoff team that they really care about. With a month still to play, maybe Jones is as high as sixth. Maybe he could be tenth or lower. Wherever they vote him, it doesn't change the fact that Jones is one of the best players in baseball this year. The Orioles are lucky to have him. Orioles fans are lucky he's on our favorite team. As for getting the franchise a sixth MVP trophy, well, maybe next year. But hopes for a fourth Orioles World Series championship are still alive. Jones is a big part of why.     "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Royals (AL-C), 4. Athletics (WC #1), 5. Mariners/Tigers (WC #2). Aside from the Mariners falling 1/2 game back of the Tigers, that seeding has stayed the same. There was some movement within the standings, though, as both the Orioles and Angels pulled away from the second-place team in their respective division and the A's had a terrible week that sent them tumbling further from the Angels in the west and cutting their wild card lead by three games. Here are the updated standings:    Division Leaders Record Games + Change from 8/29   E - Orioles 82-57 9.5 +2.5   C - Royals 77-61 1 -0.5   W - Angels 84-55 5 +3   Wild Card Race Record Games +/- Change from 8/29   Athletics 79-60 +2.5 -3   Tigers 77-63 -- --   Mariners 76-63 -0.5 -0.5   Yankees 72-66 -4 -1   Blue Jays 72-67 -5 +1   Indians 71-67 -5 -1    The Yankees, Blue Jays, and Indians are pretty much out of it, though it's certainly not unprecedented for a team to come back from a large deficit in September (just ask the 2011 Red Sox). The Indians had a big chance to make their move last week, but couldn't get the job done. They came within three outs of a three-game sweep of the Royals before the last game was suspended due to rain, then they lost three of four to the Tigers. The Blue Jays, on the other hand, have won five games in a row in an attempt to creep back into our consciousness. But really, the race for the wild card is between the Athletics, Mariners, and Tigers. Here is what they have going on this weekend:    Athletics vs Astros The A's are reeling. They were swept in a four-game series by the Angels last weekend, and spent this week losing two out of three to the Mariners. Their once seemingly ironclad postseason spot is in danger. They play a weekend series against the Astros, which might seem like sweet respite. But the Astros just took three of four from the Angels so anything could happen.    I'm rooting for the Astros in this one. I think it would be interesting for the A's to continue to fall, plus I always root for bad teams. It's in my blood. Angels @ Twins The Angels are just two games ahead of the Orioles for the best record in baseball. Previously I was against the Orioles getting the #1 seed because I thought they'd have a better chance against the Royals than the winner of an A's/Mariners wild card game. My feelings have changed, though. I want the best record in baseball. The Twins are bad, though, so it's unlikely the O's will gain any ground over the weekend.    Mariners @ Rangers Man, the AL West is really slumming it this weekend. The Rangers are the only team who have been officially eliminated from all postseason play. I'm still rooting for the Mariners to make the postseason over the Tigers, and they shouldn't have too tough of a time getting wins this weekend. Tigers vs. Giants Speaking of the Tigers, they'll have a tougher task this weekend. The Giants are the current first wild card team in the NL league, and are just two games behind the Dodgers in the NL West. I'll be rooting for the Giants, but if you have an NL rooting interest I guess you might not be. Yankees vs Royals The Royals go to New York fighting for their playoff lives. They've been clinging to first place for awhile now, and it would be nice for them to get some breathing room ahead of the Tigers. I think I speak for us all when I say go Royals!

The Orioles defeated the Reds 9-7. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles of 2014 are lovable winners, not lovable losers. This is a team that is easy to like, not just because of the number of wins they have registered that gives them the largest current divisional lead in baseball, but for the personalities and character that make this a great outfit.It goes practically without saying that the clubhouse meteorologist is Buck Showalter. He sets the atmosphere that has resulted in not only a great place to play for the athletes, but also a great team to watch for the fans of the Orioles.It all started back at the end of 2011, where the Baltimore Orioles went 34-23 after Showalter took the helm. The atmosphere was evident at FanFest in the winter of 2012. There was a palpable sense that a new wind was blowing; this clubhouse was filled with guys who liked being together and who had a vision for a new era of baseball in Baltimore. I wrote about it at the time, but I was far from the only O\xe2\x80\x99s writer to make note of the change.So what are the components of the likeable Orioles?Leadership at the Top \xe2\x80\x93 This speaks of Buck Showalter primarily, but also of the relationship he has with Dan Duquette and the moves they have made together. No GM is going to make perfect moves every time, as some will work out better than others, and a few will prove to be rather poor decisions. The bulk of Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s transactions have been wisely made, and even his slowest and most vocal critics are having to acknowledge his skills. To be fair, some of the key components on the current Orioles date back to the era of Andy MacPhail \xe2\x80\x93 particularly Adam Jones and Chris Tillman from the trade for Eric Bedard, and Chris Davis and Tommy Hunter for Koji Uehara, and claiming Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day off waivers. MacPhail was not a terrible GM, he just never had a manager bound for success like Showalter \xe2\x80\x93 until it was too late personally. There is no locker for \xe2\x80\x9cDrama\xe2\x80\x9d in this clubhouse.Showalter is the prototypical players\xe2\x80\x99 manager. He puts himself in their cleats and cares about them not only as players but as people. The players know they are going to get a fair shake from a guy who wants nothing more than for them to succeed. This eliminates a lot of \xe2\x80\x9cdrama.\xe2\x80\x9d There is no locker for \xe2\x80\x9cDrama\xe2\x80\x9d in this clubhouse. Beyond his people skills and perhaps over-developed sense of loyalty, Showalter is truly a good baseball guy. He is detailed and thoughtful about every decision. J.J. Hardy said of him just recently that it seems Showalter knows what is going to happen before it happens.Clubhouse Leadership \xe2\x80\x93 Adam Jones is regularly considered the face of the franchise and the leader of the team. He is continually competing with great hustle, is positive at all times, and has a short memory that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cry over spilt milk \xe2\x80\x93 just \xe2\x80\x9cget \xe2\x80\x98em tomorrow\xe2\x80\x9d when things go wrong. That is contagious. Out in the bullpen it is Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day who is spoken of as the leading voice. While keeping it light (along with Tommy Hunter), he also keeps the guys engaged and focused upon the roles they may be called upon to play. These are the noisy leaders.

He is one of those people who appear to only have a budget of about 250 words to use in a day. But he is all business, and he needs to say little to be the leader by example. There are multiple excuses he could have used over the 2012-13 seasons to account for some performance drops, but he said nothing. And the O\xe2\x80\x99s feature a number of other quiet leaders \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Tillman, Matt Wieters, Hardy, etc.Although the general public does not know exactly what was said behind the scenes with the Manny Machado bat throwing incident, the overall sense was that not a lot needed to be said after the players in the clubhouse were done dealing with it.Generational Development \xe2\x80\x93 For a lot of years \xe2\x80\x93 too many years \xe2\x80\x93 Orioles fans had little to look at in terms of players who were developed in the system. This has changed with the arrival of Machado, Jonathan Schoop, Chris Tillman, Matt Wieters, Kevin Gausman, and most recently Caleb Joseph. And there are more to come. As they arrive, it is common to see TV shots in the dugout where the veterans are working with the younger players to talk about the game and what needs to be done in varied situations. It is great to pick up a free agent like Nelson Cruz, but as Duquette has rightly said, the future strength of the organization has to come through the system. Seeing players come through the farm system is a great encouragement to fans and adds to the interest in the team.The Renaissance \xe2\x80\x93 The Baltimore Orioles have become known as a place of opportunity and career renewal. Though no longer with the Orioles, a prime example is Nate McLouth who totally revived his career. The story of Steve Pearce and the year that he has had is absolutely amazing. Delmon Young is glad to be in Baltimore this year and to put up some very good numbers for the amount of playing time he had received. Consider others like Bud Norris, Evan Meek, and Brad Brach \xe2\x80\xa6 and maybe even Joe Saunders?

Having not made it in the Red Sox and Angels organizations, Dan Duquette found him in Mexico; and after a time getting established in the minors in 2012, he came up in the middle of the season and has been a mainstay ever since. It is such an enjoyable story from a fan\xe2\x80\x99s point of view \xe2\x80\x93 totally different than, say, a NFL rookie who has never been anything but THE big man on campus his whole life. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99 experience is far more like that of the typical fan who has to work hard to make a living.The Reformation \xe2\x80\x93 There are not a lot of cities, organizations, and clubhouses that would welcome Nelson Cruz after his history and suspension. But coming into town with a spirit of humble contrition, Cruz was embraced early by the team and organization. The leaders in the clubhouse strategically initiated the entire conversation surrounding his arrival, and the results have been stellar.Under the Radar \xe2\x80\x93 Not many baseball writers selected the Orioles to be the AL East champions or to be a serious playoff contender. The team embraces the underdog role, and proving the experts wrong adds to the fans\xe2\x80\x99 satisfaction and pleasure.All in all, it makes the O\xe2\x80\x99s a team of lovable winners.

When Tampa hitters were able to reach, Chen was able to either strike someone out to end the inning or get the hitter to pop/ground out. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s issue continues to be his pitch count however, as he was lifted after throwing 107 pitches over six innings. However that\xe2\x80\x99s also due in part to the opponent; that\xe2\x80\x99s just what Tampa does.This game was scoreless going to the last of the eighth inning, as Ryan Webb came on in relief for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. He allowed two runners to reach on base hits before Evan Meek was summoned from the bullpen in relief of Webb. Meek would load the bases with a walk, and then allow an RBI-single to Yuniel Escobar to give Tampa a 1-0 lead. Hanigan would come up later in the inning with the bags still juiced, and deliver a two-RBI-single. Tampa closer Jake McGee took to the hill in the ninth and sent the Birds down 1-2-3, snapping the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 three-game winning streak.Obviously you can\xe2\x80\x99t win them all, and nobody\xe2\x80\x99s expecting that. But it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to have a shot when you don\xe2\x80\x99t score any runs. But again, good pitching will shut down good hitting most of the time. And keep in mind that the same is true on the flip side of the coin. Oriole pitching was great last night as well. That 3-0 score is not in any way indicative of how this game unfolded. Even after the O\xe2\x80\x99s surrendered the runs, Joe Saunders was able to come in and close Tampa down in the inning to send the game to the ninth to give the O\xe2\x80\x99s one last shot at tying the game.With all of this said, there was one thing I found very interesting in this game. Buck Showalter indicated that there were a few relieversCourtesy of Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sportsfrom which he wanted to stay away last night. The O\xe2\x80\x99s of course had to use several relievers on Thursday against Cincinnati (although the bullpen wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used on Wednesday night at all). You notice that Showalter went to the likes of Webb, Meek, and Saunders in the eighth inning last night as opposed to some of the usual suspects \xe2\x80\x93 O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Hunter, and Miller.Was Showalter punting the game in a sense? Not in the least so far as I know. However the fact that the Baltimore Orioles have such a wide lead in the AL East combined with the fact that they now have quite a few more relievers on the expanded roster gives the Birds a bit more flexibility. This is not to say that there was no faith in the likes of Webb and company, however it prevents the O\xe2\x80\x99s from using their key relievers in a game that while important was far from a must-win. I suspect that going into this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game most of the bullpen would be available, so if in fact that\xe2\x80\x99s the case Showalter may well have at the very least been willing to lose one minor battle to win the war.  There will be fans who don\xe2\x80\x99t like that concept in the least, and I can understand that. However it\xe2\x80\x99s really no different than running out of pinch hitters in a National League game and having to send a reliever up to bat. At the end of the day assuming that the Orioles win the AL East is it really going to matter who won this specific game? (Furthermore, odds are that O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Hunter, and Miller would be on the post-season roster while Webb and Meek might not be. It pays to keep guys as fresh as possible.)The series continues this afternoon in a game that\xe2\x80\x99ll begin just after 1 PM \xe2\x80\x93 and nationally televised by FOX at that. Keving Gausman will get the start for the Orioles, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Drew Smyly. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

The team shuffled through six managers in that time frame, none of whom lasted more than three years until Buck Showalter. The revolving door took in and spit out the likes of Ray Miller, Mike Hargrove, Lee Mazzilli, Sam Perlozzo, and Dave Trembley.Baltimore was also more like a stop-over on a cross-country flight than a permanent job for several head baseball executives.

09/08/2014,"[('Orioles release 2015 schedule - Camden Chat', "" One good thing about sitting in first place in the division with a 9.5 game lead in September is that there is not a need to look to next year. We can do it because we want to, because it's a Monday afternoon and we're bored, not because there's nothing left to look forward to in the current season. The 2015 schedule was released on Monday afternoon - so, the Orioles are in first place right now and there's a cure for boredom. That's a win on both ends. As far as the 2015 season itself, for the Orioles, it will span from Opening Day on April 6 (a Monday) through the final regular season game on October 4, which is a Sunday. After opening the season at home this year, they will instead open on the road next season, getting the campaign underway with three games against the Trop. They will, however, close out the season with a seven-game homestand, with the final three games coming against the Yankees. The home opener will take place on Friday, April 10, against the Blue Jays. Once again, the O's will find themselves playing in Boston for the Patriots Day game on April 20. For interleague opponents next year, the Orioles will face the National League East. That means that their customary series against the Nationals will be back to three games in each city. The O's will host the Nats from July 10-12 and head to the Washington mallpark from September 21-23, a very late-season interleague matchup that could be crucial if both teams perform the way they have this year. The July Nats series is the last series before the All-Star Break.    They'll play the Mets and Phillies for two games in each team's park and two games at home. The Phillies games are consecutive (June 15-16 in Baltimore, June 17-18 in Philadelphia) while the Mets games are split apart. They play the Mets on May 5-6, which will be followed by a four-game series against the Yankees in New York. The Mets come to Baltimore on August 18-19.    The O's will also host the Braves July 27-29 and head to Miami from May 22-24 to wrap up their interleague play for the season. Unless they make the World Series, of course. Once again, the Orioles will come out of the All-Star Break with a long road trip, heading to Detroit, New York, and then Tampa Bay from July 17-26. Their annual West Coast expedition will run from August 3-12, and they don't have to make any further trips that far for the remainder of the year.    The longest road trip of the season will run ten games from September 17-27, spanning a series against the Rays, Nats, and Red Sox. May will be the most active month at Camden Yards, with 18 of the 27 games that month coming at home. By contrast, it will be the emptiest in July, when 17 of 27 games are on the road. They'll be at home more in the first half (48 games) than in the second half (33 games). If the O's can win on the road next year like this year's team, there won't be much to worry about there, although having fewer late-summer game dates is unfortunate if O's fans won't get as many chances to bask in a winning team. You can check out the full schedule for yourself\xc2\xa0here.    It's hard to say whether this schedule counts as easy or hard because nobody knows how all of the teams they'll face will be next year. We don't know who will be on any of those teams yet, or who will be on the Orioles. No one would have expected the defending champion Red Sox to be a weak team this year, but here we are. And the Orioles are plenty capable of beating any good team or getting swept by any bad team. That's baseball.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Prospect season in review: Dylan Bundy - Camden Chat', "" Dylan Bundy's story so far is well-known to many Orioles fans, but let's do a quick rehash to bring everyone up to speed. Considered the best pitcher in the 2011 amateur draft, the Orioles selected Bundy in the first round, fourth overall. He wowed scouts with not only his otherworldly performance on the mound in his senior year of high school (71 IP, 0.20 ERA, 158 K, 5 BB) but also with his intense workouts and work ethic. Bundy breezed through the low minors in 2012, promoted from low-A Delmarva after making eight starts without allowing an earned run. He demolished high-A batters for 12 starts and had made three starts for the double-A Bowie Baysox when the Orioles called him up for a taste of the big leagues in September. It was Bundy's goal to pitch in the\xc2\xa0 majors before he turned 20 years old, and the Orioles obliged. He made two appearances out of the bullpen before he was shut down for the season, and when he showed up for spring training in 2013 everyone had high hopes. That's when the pain started, and after three months of trying to rehab, Bundy underwent Tommy John surgery on June 27, 2013. He spent the rest of 2013 and half of 2014 resting and rehabbing, and was finally ready to start a professional baseball game on June 15, 2014. Bundy's 2014 debut was with the short-season Aberdeen Ironbirds, and he spent three starts there before he was moved up to pitch for the high-A Frederick Keys. The Orioles kept him on a pitch count of 75 during these starts, and if you were following him through the box scores you may not have been impressed. But after spending a year away from competitive baseball, the fact is that Dylan Bundy had to re-learn how to pitch. His fastball velocity before his injury was in the upper-90s and he spent much of his 2014 season in the low-90s, only\xc2\xa0 starting to touch 95 towards the end of his season. He had to work on location and on secondary pitches and get his surgically repaired elbow back into game condition. In nine starts between Aberdeen and Frederick between June 15th and August 5th, Bundy pitched 41 1/3 innings. He struck out fewer batters than he had before his injury, walked more, and didn't throw as hard. But while it's almost always the case that you can't evaluate minor leaguers by their stats alone, it is especially the case for a pitcher returning from major arm surgery. The results don't matter. His health matters. On August 15th, Bundy was shut down with two weeks left in the minor league season due to a strained lat muscle. It's not the best way to end a season, but it's not an elbow or shoulder injury, so it's not worth worrying about.    Thanks to his injury, a bit of shine has come off of Bundy as a prospect. Ranked by most reputable sources in the top five of prospects in all of baseball before the 2013 season, he dropped to 15-30 prior to 2014. ESPN analyst Keith Law ranked Bundy at #31 prior to the start of the 2014 season, but in his mid-season review bumped him all the way up to #12 based on his observation that he is most of the way back from TJ surgery. Tucker Blair of Baseball Prospectus and Orioles Nation saw Bundy pitch in July and gave a rave review, saying that Bundy is one of the most polished pitchers in the minors and that all of his pitches grade as plus or potentially plus. 2015 will be a big year for Dylan Bundy. He will have had a healthy off-season to prepare for spring training, and he'll have to prove that he's all the way back from his surgery and ready to help the Orioles at the major-league level. Even if he doesn't break camp with the Orioles at the start of the 2015 season, you have to hope to see him in Baltimore sooner rather than later.

09/09/2014,"[('Prospect season in review: Adrian Marin - Camden Chat', "" When the Orioles drafted Adrian Marin out of a Miami area high school in the third round of the 2012 draft, the young shortstop was so excited that he posted a picture of himself in an Orioles hat, signing his contract, before it was even official. He still had to take the legendary Orioles physical. He passed. It's hard not to like someone who displays so much exuberance about joining the organization. You want them to beat the odds and turn into the next star or even superstar. Marin, still only 20, spent his second full season in the organization playing for the High-A Frederick Keys in the Carolina League. He was nearly three years younger than the average player in that league. That's the kind of thing that is important to keep in mind when considering a player's performance that, on paper, looks pretty underwhelming. They can't all be fast-moving marvels like Mike Trout or Manny Machado. If that was Marin's level of talent, he would have been a first rounder, not #99 overall. The reminder about being young for his league is important because it was not a banner year for Marin when it came to hitting. Over 430 plate appearances in 115 games for the Keys, he batted only .232/.271/.341, showing some respectable speed with 30 doubles and 12 stolen bases, but little in the way of power or ability to make contact. That followed on the heels of a .667 OPS he hit for in Delmarva last year. Though young for both leagues when he played in them, it still seems fair to figure that offense is not going to be a calling card for Marin. Nor does it need to be, given that he plays a middle infield position. However, he'll need to get up to at least some bare minimum level to be able to make it farther up the system, let alone to the big leagues.    In the prospect rankings on MLB.com before the season, Marin was considered the #11 prospect in the system - a name worth knowing, but not anyone who would be in line for any immediate impact. By season's end, that same list ranked him as the #13 prospect in the O's organization. That's not exactly falling off the radar, but it means he didn't grow like the team had hoped, either. Other players passed him while he stayed in place.    Before the season, Marin was also considered the best defensive infielder in the Orioles system\xc2\xa0by Baseball America, although that may be a reflection of a lack of competition more than anything. He made 15 errors while playing short for the Keys this season. That sounds bad, although you shouldn't judge a minor leaguer by his errors. After all, Machado had 19 errors between Delmarva and Frederick in 2011 and committed 23 errors in Bowie in 2012 before his MLB call-up where he helped the Orioles into the playoffs with his amazing defense. That's not to say that Marin is going to turn into Machado out there, either, but you shouldn't write him off yet. That said, there are questions about whether he'll be able to remain at shortstop in the long run. Baseball Prospectus' Tucker Blair\xc2\xa0reported on Marin back in April and made note of a fringe arm that could ultimately be destined for second base. A solid defensive second baseman who's a bit light with the bat can still have value, although of course it's no sure thing that Marin could even develop into that.    With the way he performed this year, it wouldn't be a surprise to see Marin start out the 2015 season repeating in Frederick. He'll still be just 21, which is young-ish for that level, especially for a player who was picked out of high school. If the O's agree with the idea that his future may not be at shortstop, he may have to get adjusted to a new position on the diamond as well. Every year is an important year for a minor leaguer. The nature of the system is that there are always new people pushing up from below you. It's especially going to be important for Marin to keep himself moving forward. Before long, if he doesn't get better, he might find himself in the level of player who gets shuffled off to another team in a Dan Duquette August trade. I'll be rooting for him. The dream is not dead yet. How can you not cheer for this guy?

First, the Athletics inked Yoenis Cespedes. A few months later, the Cubs snapped up Jorge Soler. And on July 6, 2012, the Orioles signed Henry Urrutia for\xc2\xa0a signing bonus of $778,500. He was, without question, the least flashy of the trio. Urrutia was making his second defection attempt out of Cuba. He failed once before back in 2010 and was suspended for the entire 2011 season in Cuba as a result. Then, after the O\'s penned him, he ran into visa issues when he tried to come to the United States to be assigned somewhere in the Orioles minor league system. He managed to get things figured out in the early goings of the 2013 season. He was initially assigned to double-A Bowie, but was able to earn his way up to Triple-A Norfolk and, eventually, all the way to Baltimore. He showed a knack for hitting singles the opposite way and earned a spot as the Orioles seventh ranked prospect, according to Baseball America, following the season. Prior to the start of the season, Baseball America had Urrutia listed as the best hitter for average in the O\'s farm system. You wouldn\'t guess that by looking at how his 2014 worked out.    In spring training there was talk that he may battle with David Lough and Francisco Peguero (among others) for time in the outfielder on the big club. Maybe he could get some swings at DH. But, he showed little improvement in the areas that the team was concerned about.    In 17 games he hit one home run and five doubles, which amounted to an OK slugging percentage of .452. However, he had seemed to lose his ability to hit for average, posting just a .262 batting average and one walk. And the Orioles did not see enough change in his work with the glove to put him on the opening day roster. His fielding has long been an issue of contention for some. Following the 2013 Futures Game, in which Urrutia went 0-for-3 at the plate,\xc2\xa0Baseball Prospectus\' Zach Mortimer said "" I\xe2\x80\x99ve already made up my mind on Urrutia defensively, and if he\xe2\x80\x99s not stinging it at the plate, I\'m not especially interested.""    Fair enough, he is a corner outfielder. Their defense can be forgiven if they put up offensive numbers. We all know that rings true for the Orioles as much, as any other team, in left field. Unfortunately for Urrutia, he has been doing anything but ""stinging it"" in 2014. His year began with Norfolk. There, he was pretty awful for the first month of the season. After April 27, here is what his slash line looked like: .220/.250/.293. Those kind of numbers aren\'t even really passable as a middle infielder, let alone a left fielder who isn\'t especially adept with the leather. The left-handed hitting outfielder then missed all of May and June with a sports hernia injury. He returned to the field on July 5 as a member of the Gulf Coast Orioles and was just as bad there, hitting .230 with an on base percentage of .255. He walked three times in the whole month of July.    On August 1, he headed back up north to the Tides and things began to look up. His return was a three-hit performance where he also stole a base; one of his two swiped bags on the season. Urrutia hit better all around once he came back from his elongated rehab stint with Gulf Coast. The Tides season ended on September 1. In that final month, the 6-foot-3 Cuban hit .310 with an on-base percentage of .317 and slugging of .370. It helped improve his final slash line to .270/.284/.338. In Triple-A this season, he had 12 doubles, 17 RBI and zero home runs in 51 games. We could give him the benefit of the doubt and talk about how he went on the DL a month into the season and was likely hurt before that. That could have led to him not being able to get as strong as he would like. But wait, back in January the Baltimore Sun\'s Eduardo Encina\xc2\xa0reported that Urrutia had added nearly 20 pounds of muscle to his lanky frame. He was tipping the scales at 201. So, what happened? It certainly was not reflected in his play on the field. Maybe his body just can\'t handle more muscle. This apparent combination of poor defense and the inability to hit home runs just doesn\'t seem to fit on this Oriole roster any time soon. But Baltimore isn\'t about to give up on him. He needs to get a fully healthy season in and, even then, he would have to be at least third in the pecking order of left field candidates who are set to return behind Alejandro De Aza and David Lough (Delmon Young and Nelson Cruz are on one-year deals).    2015 is set to be a make or break type of year for the Cuban as it could be with so many other Oriole prospects.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles beat Red Sox 10-6; Wei-Yin Chen picks up 15th \\u2026', "" Watching the Red Sox as the Orioles beat them 10-6 on Wednesday afternoon was like peering into a mirror and seeing a darker past. A disinterested team putting out a lineup full of players who are either checked out of the season or probably not major league level talent to begin with. We've seen that story before, not so long ago really. It's so much better being on the other end of that. The Wednesday win temporarily gives the Orioles a 10.5 game lead in the American League East, pending the evening's action. The Yankees are in action at home against the Rays, while the Blue Jays host the Cubs. The magic number to clinch the division is now 8. This is not a drill. This is not a dream. This is not a joke. Things were so much in the Orioles favor that they were even able to pull off a win in a day game started by a Red Sox pitcher, Brandon Workman, who came into the game with an ERA near 5. These things often work against the Orioles, but in this game nearly everything came up Birdland.  The Orioles' magic number is now 8. This is not a dream.  It helps when you bat around in the third inning of the game. That's exactly what the Orioles were able to do. The party got started with a Ryan Flaherty infield single. Things looked calm enough then, but after a brief interruption from a Jonathan Schoop popout, the Orioles offense - helped out by the Red Sox inability to field - fired into high gear. Following that popout, the next eight Orioles reached base, spraying hits all over the field. There was even a bases loaded walk issued to Steve Pearce.    They smoked hard-hit balls past Sox third baseman Carlos Rivero, like an Adam Jones double that drove in two runs. They hit little bloopers at him that a real third baseman would have caught. They even benefited when he committed an error on a Nelson Cruz grounder that should have been a routine out. When all was said and done they had six runs on six hits. Schoop made two outs in the inning.    Being staked to a six run lead was more than enough for Orioles starter Wei-Yin Chen, who carried a perfect game into the sixth inning before allowing a one out double to Sox catcher Dan Butler, a ball that ricocheted off the Green Monster about halfway up the wall in left center. This was Butler's first major league hit. Good timing. It wasn't really that long of a perfect game in progress, long enough that you notice but not long enough that you really start getting excited. In the end, there was no need to lament a lone hit. Chen pitched seven innings, allowing three hits while striking out four. Chen lost the shutout on a leadoff home run by Xander Bogaerts in the seventh inning. He'd only thrown 93 pitches when he was pulled, but why work him harder than needed in a blowout? Chen is a guy who seems to benefit from extra rest when he gets it.       Unlike some games where the Orioles score early and then go quiet at the plate, they piled on as the game went on. Caleb Joseph hit a home run off the top of the Green Monster wall, driving in two runs. The ball actually bounced back into the field of play, leaving a confused Joseph at first base until he realized the umpire signaled a home run. It was Joseph's ninth home run of the year and his first since his streak of five straight games with a homer. The O's even tacked on a couple more in the ninth inning, with defensive replacement Kelly Johnson driving in a run on a double and Flaherty driving in another on a double of his own. For Flaherty, it was a banner day, going 4-5 with two RBI from the #8 spot in the lineup. Joseph was another star, going 3-5 with three RBI. Adam Jones also had a multi-hit for the game, going 3-5 with a pair of doubles and two RBI.    The extra runs proved to be important as garbage time reliever Joe Saunders was a disaster in the ninth inning, giving up five runs in only a third of an inning as he failed to close out a game he entered with his team up by nine runs. The mess was capped off by giving up Rivero's first major league home run, which brought home three runs and forced O's manager Buck Showalter to burn a reliever who matters in the game. That reliever was Tommy Hunter, who was supposed to close the door. Instead, he and the fielders behind him combined to make things even more dramatic. A pop fly for the second out was nearly bungled by the outfield tandem of Quintin Berry (ninth inning replacement) and Alejandro De Aza. They bumped into one another and Berry juggled the ball before making the catch. Hunter then walked Mookie Betts, and Showalter decided to use another reliever who matters to try to get the game's last out. All of the ninth inning tomfoolery created a save situation for Darren O'Day. Bogaerts hit a sharp grounder to Johnson at third, who fielded it and stepped on third for the force to bring the game to a close. A win is a win. Even if it's more interesting than it needed to be. Chen picked up the win for the game, raising his record to a surprising 15-4. The save was O'Day's third. Workman got the loss for Boston, dropping to 1-9. The O's get an off day back home on Thursday before playing a split doubleheader against the Yankees on Friday. The day part of the doubleheader has a scheduled 1:05 start. Brandon McCarthy and Kevin Gausman are the probable starting pitchers.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

But Baltimore finished off a sweep in Boston.That\'s a torrid 44-20 for the Orioles since June 30, which would be remarkable if not for the Angels\' 45-20 over the same period \xe2\x80\x93 which explains why Baltimore is still chasing Los Angeles for the American League\'s best record.The Nationals are a mere 39-24 over the same period, still good enough for best in the NL during that stretch and tops in the league \xe2\x80\x93 barely over the Dodgers \xe2\x80\x93 for the full season.Officially, neither East Division is over but trust Harang.And listen to Yankees manager Joe Girardi: ""We have to win every day.""Translation: ""I\'m not allowed to say what you\'re all thinking until it\'s mathematically impossible.""The magic numbers are eight for Baltimore, 10 for Washington. (And those pesky Angels are sitting there at nine for the AL West.)So, go ahead and have a race to the first clinch.Hey, it\'s better than trying to decipher the Nationals and Orioles\' ugly legal snit over the proceeds from the regional TV network they share. Or Orioles manager Buck Showalter\'s attempt to pull out a zinger this summer that would fit in any respectable (or otherwise) political campaign:""You realize how big an area this was for the Orioles before our owner was kind enough to let them have a team here,"" Showalter said before a game in Washington.His next visit could be Game 3 of the World Series.That, of course, requires the Nationals to finally win a playoff series \xe2\x80\x93 and one more after that; for the Orioles to win a round \xe2\x80\x93 their 2012 Wild Card Game notwithstanding \xe2\x80\x93 for the first time since 1997.Realistic?Both teams can put the belt in Beltway:The Nationals have gotten steadily healthier through the second half and it shows in an offense that\'s missing only Ryan Zimmerman, whose torn hamstring might be good enough by October to make him a significant threat off the bench if not a part-time starter.The Orioles have survived a year-long struggle by 2013 homer champ Chris Davis and season-ending injuries to Matt Wieters and Manny Machado.The real way through October, though, usually revolves around pitching.Washington solved some bullpen questions with what manager Matt Williams calls a committee but has looked a lot like Drew Storen in ninth innings this week.Williams cites Storen, Tyler Clippard, Matt Thornton and (temporarily, at least) deposed closer Rafael Soriano as experienced closers. Depth? Embarrassment of riches? Potential controversy once Soriano has worked out some mechanical issues?Or a chance for Storen to relive or live down that moment that has defined the Nationals\' existence for nearly two years \xe2\x80\x93 a stunning ninth-inning turnaround in the decisive game of the 2012 Division Series against St. Louis.Baltimore\'s mystery is its rotation \xe2\x80\x93 the Orioles\' internal ""Who\'s No. 1?"" question \xe2\x80\x93 not to mention No. 2, No. 3, etc. Maybe it doesn\'t matter.While Detroit and Oakland were busy trading to match up elite rotations -- and exactly what are their magic numbers? \xe2\x80\x93 the Orioles have cruised along with five guys all with earned run averages between 3.32 and 3.92. None of Chris Tillman, Wei-Yin Chen, Bud Norris, Miguel Gonzalez and Kevin Gausman has a losing record.As Showalter says, ""We have a chance to roll the dice in October. I\'d feel real good about rolling the dice with this group.""***\xc2\xa0(Photo: Joy R. Absalon, USA TODAY Sports)PENNANT PRIMERDays left in season: 18   Wednesday\'s big mover: Brewers.

But anyone who saw yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game knows that the score is probably not indicative of how the game unfolded. Some folks will probably say that the slight hiccup by the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen in the ninth inning could signify problems down the road \xe2\x80\x93 and this is not to say that it might not. However Joe Saunders was the pitcher who came on to close out the game, and he was the one who gave up the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of the runs late. As soon as Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day came out of the bullpen, the game was quickly over. O\xe2\x80\x99Day almost certainly will be on the post season roster; Saunders probably will not.Wei-Yin Chen gave the Orioles a strong effort in a starting role yesterday, in a game which featured 5.1 innings of perfect baseball before Chen allowed a double. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 0 BB, 4 K. While the \xe2\x80\x98pen ended up playing a larger role in the end, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not Chen\xe2\x80\x99s doing; having a starter going deep at this point in the season where the Orioles are in the standings is huge. Especially when you have a bullpen as strong as that of the Orioles. The fresher they are for those crisp October evenings, the better.The\xc2\xa0Boston Massacre\xc2\xa0moniker probably comes from the third inning, when the O\xe2\x80\x99s did much of their damage. Alejandro De Aza continued his dominance over Boston pitching with an RBI-single, and he would come into score on Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 two-RBI double. Later in the inning, Steve Pearce would draw a bases loaded walk, which gave the Baltimore Orioles a 4-0 lead. Caleb Joseph and Ryan Flaherty would each add RBI-singles, as the O\xe2\x80\x99s batted around in the inning and gave themselves a 6-0 cushion.Througout this series, the Orioles seemed to be playing for a purpose where as Boston seemed to be \xe2\x80\x9cmailing it in\xe2\x80\x9d (this according to ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Sportscenter last night). And I say that as someone who knows what it looks like to mail it in come September. To draw a comparison, the O\xe2\x80\x99s never really stopped playing for the post season last September. The ended up with lots of tired bats and lots of guys who just ran out of gas. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they ever faced a mismatch similar to what we saw from Boston in this series.In his next turn at the plate in the fifth inning, Caleb Joseph would add a two-run homer to run the lead to 8-0 in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 favor.Courtesy of Greg M. Cooper-USA TODAY SportsBoston\xe2\x80\x99s Xavier Bogaert\xe2\x80\x99s would add a solo homer in the seventh to get the BoSox on the board, but two RBI-doubles (one from Flaherty and one from Kelly Johnson) in the top of the ninth would run the lead to 10-1. Boston would push out the aforementioned rally in the last of the ninth with a two-RBI double by Daniel Nava and a Rivero three-run homer off of Joe Saunders. However again, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day ended the game when it needed to be ended, sending the Orioles home.The Birds will now head home where they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a day off today, and one in which several of the players will attend tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Ravens/ Steelers game.

Writers eager to find Spring Training stories to file jumped at the chance to have some fun at his expense after Orioles manager Buck Showalter related that Hart was less than well-versed as to the accomplishments of Frank Robinson. Headlines spread out across the interwebz such as 'Orioles, Buck Showalter give Josh Hart a history lesson', or 'Orioles prospect doesn't know who Frank Robinson is', etc...It was a mildly amusing lede, and, of course, an embellished one. Hart took the attention in stride, produced the 1 page report on Robinson that Buck requested, and showed himself to be mature beyond his 19 years. Following his selection with the 37th overall pick in the 2013 MLB draft, Hart made brief stops at the Orioles' Sarasota complex in the Gulf Coast League as well as with the Short Season-A Aberdeen Ironbirds. Prospect lists had a wide range of opinion concerning Hart's pre-season ranking, with\xc2\xa0MLB.com placing him 6th in the O's organizational hierarchy,\xc2\xa0Baseball Prospectus slotting him in at 10th, and John Sickels placing him at 16th. The consensus view was that Hart exhibited tremendous potential as a defensive center fielder and a possible speedy lead off hitter with very little power, but that he would face a long journey in translating his athletic abilities into specific baseball skills. He was assigned to the full season Low-A Delmarva Shorebirds at the start of the 2014 season; a rather aggressive assignment considering he would be facing competition on average 2 years older than him. And the difference in experience showed as Hart's bat, not necessarily struggled but was certainly overmatched at the start of the season, compiling a line of .266 / .301 / .273 with 7 walks to 37 strikeouts over 154 plate appearances and 6 stolen bases out of 8 attempts through late May. In spite of his offensive scuffles he never let his defense go into a funk, making\xc2\xa0spectacular diving catches such as this.    Then came his first taste of injury at the professional level. On May 26th, in the 2nd game of a double-header Hart tore the meniscus in his right knee. Viewed as a 4-6 week injury, he would ultimately miss just one month of action, returning for a rehab assignment with the Orioles GCL affiliate on June 26th. After a week in Sarasota he proved himself ready to return to action with the Shorebirds. Over the final 2 months of the season he would amass a slash line very similar to his first 2 months: .246 / .302 / .295 with 14 walks to 49 strikeouts over 199 plate appearances and 5 stolen bases out of 8 attempts. He was showing particular statistical improvement over the last month of the season, going .276 / .344 / .333. Baseball Prospectus' Tucker Blair was suitably impressed with Hart's development after seeing him play in late July. In\xc2\xa0his report he wrote  The consistent, short stroke from Hart works often, although the production remains hollow at this time. Hart makes a ton of contact, but he is still learning the in's and out's of the game. I can see the development from early April simply from his approach at the plate. He is progressing even though there has been little evidence. Hart is going to see production once he gets more acclimated with professional ball. Some of his best AB this series was against Giolito, where he showed progression and refinement from his first AB to the last.   Hart will turn 20 years old in October. It's reasonable to expect that he will begin the 2015 season in Delmarva again. He would still be a year younger than the average competition, it would allow him to demonstrate any adjustments he has made to that level of competition, and possible provide him a chance to build some early confidence in his offensive skills before possibly earning promotion to High-A Frederick.    As for where he will rank come prospect list time, he's not yet even close to sniffing a top-100 overall list. But one will likely find him on the back end of most every Orioles specific Top-10 list. In terms of Orioles positional prospects he likely will trail the likes of the more advanced Christian Walker, Mike Yastrzemski, and Dariel Alvarez. While Chance Sisco's massively successful offensive season with Delmarva will catch a ton of attention, his ultimate defensive home is still an open question. Any potential ranking is still heavily dependent on one's view of his ultimate potential, but he did nothing to dissuade one from believing he could be the heir to Adam Jones as the Orioles center fielder come 2018.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Who should the Orioles have in their bullpen during the ...', "" A few days ago, Tyler\xc2\xa0went through the options the O's have in the rotation come playoff time. While the playoff rotation clearly has five candidates fighting for four spots, there are many more names to consider for the 8 spots in the bullpen. Let's run through each of the likely candidates by where they stand in the race. Locks: Demoted Starter, Zach Britton, Andrew Miller, Darren O'Day There is no question that the demoted starter would serve as the long man out of the bullpen. Whoever that may be, he could be able to provide more innings at higher quality than T.J. McFarland, who served in this role during the regular season. The trio of Britton, Miller and O'Day will unquestionably be included on the playoff roster unless injured. They represent the strength of the back end of the O's bullpen and there should be no argument about their inclusion. Near-Locks: Tommy Hunter, Brian Matusz Both Hunter and Matusz have been shaky at time this season. However, their overall numbers do not deviate wildly from their numbers last season. Hunter has an ERA of 3.27 after posting an ERA of 2.81 last season. Meanwhile, Matusz's ERA has risen slightly from 3.53 to 3.61. Their peripherals have also remained relatively stable. Moreover, both of them have a huge career platoon split, so their strength can be emphasized by putting them in the right situations, which should be a point of focus in the playoffs where every matchup is critical. On the Bubble: Brad Brach, T.J. McFarland, Ryan Webb Most likely, the two remaining bullpen spots will come down to Brach, McFarland and Webb. Brach and McFarland are the safe bets given they were the choices made by Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter following the acquisition of Miller. I am including Webb here primarily out of the hope that he will replace either Brach or McFarland. Both serve as multiple inning relievers, and there will be another one in the bullpen in the playoffs in the form of the demoted starter. Moreover, McFarland does not exhibit a strong platoon split, and he has allowed a higher wOBA against both right-handed and left handed batters this season than Webb and Brach.    Longshot: Ubaldo Jimenez, Evan Meek They are here for the sake of completeness. Jimenez has not appeared in a close game since his demotion from the rotation. On the other hand, Meek has spent the majority of the season in the minors, though he has made appearances in some of the most critical situations for the O's when he is in the majors. Meek is the last guy I want to see included on the playoffs roster, especially given Buck's propensity to use him.   The ideal bullpen in my mind would consist of the demoted starter, Britton, O'Day, Miller, Hunter, Matusz, Brach and Webb. I do not believe that this is the choice the O's front office and coaching staff will make, but I would feel comfortable with their choice as long as Meek is not part of it.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAs the Baltimore Orioles host the New York Yankees today in a doubleheader that is the first half of a four-game weekend series, the opportunity is now to fully establish an entire categorical separation from the New York Yankees.It could well be argued that a current 10.5-game lead is plenty separation. Yes, I suppose \xe2\x80\xa6 but I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about something very definitive regarding head-to-head competition as well.This year, the Orioles are 8-3 versus New York. In 2013 it was 9-10. In 2012 it was 9-9, or, counting also the playoffs it was 11-12 (but move a Nate McLouth fly ball one inch to the left and it would have been 12-11).The Orioles have eight of their 17 remaining games against New York. It would be great to win five or six of them and finish this season either 13-6 or 14-5 against the Evil Empire. Even a die-hard Yankees fan could not in any way say that the Orioles backed into a championship. Well \xe2\x80\xa6 yes \xe2\x80\xa6 probably they still would, but, there is no help for that mental condition.This series of course marks the final trip of Derek Jeter into Baltimore. That is amazing. I remember him playing in my town of Hagerstown as a visiting member of Greensboro in the South Atlantic League. Even then, one could see that the talent was very special.Actually, I don\xe2\x80\x99t entirely hate the NY Yankees, and a lot of that is because of Derek Jeter. He is an amazing ballplayer. And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve often said to others over the years, I swear that Jeter is batting about .450 in the hundreds of at-bats that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him play at the Yard or on TV.Of course, a lot of those hits that I have witnessed were against the Orioles. His career batting average against the Birds is .299 over 284 total games. He has hit 68 doubles, nine triples, and 24 home runs against Baltimore. His on-base percentage is .368 against the O\xe2\x80\x99s.Actually, Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s career average is .310 and OBP is .378, so the Orioles have done better against him that most. I was surprised to see this. Discounting inter-league play against NL teams (although he is .364 against the Mets is 88 games!), the AL team he has most worn out is the Angels \xe2\x80\x93 .333 over 167 games. He is also .331 against the Tigers and .327 versus the Rangers.The single most distinctive mental picture I have of Derek Jeter \xe2\x80\x93 that many people have as #1 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure \xe2\x80\x93 is the diving catch of a foul ball several rows deep into the stands a few years ago. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to love and respect that sort of competitive spirit.

The gaze appears to me to communicate, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know who I am? I\xe2\x80\x99m Derek Jeter. If I did not swing at that pitch and get a base hit, it is because it is a ball. Who do you think you are calling a strike against Derek Jeter? You\xe2\x80\x99ll be telling your grandkids that you umpired while Derek Jeter was batting; heck, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know your name right now!

It was devastating news because the 25-game suspension extends well into the postseason, where the Orioles seem destined to play.Still, just a few hours later, the Orioles were jumping and dancing on the infield grass at Camden Yards. As it turned out, Friday\xe2\x80\x99s events were even more devastating for the Yankees, who lost in crushing fashion and certainly do not appear headed to the playoffs.The Orioles, despite the loss of one of their most dangerous hitters, were celebrating because they had come from behind to beat the Yankees, 2-1, in 11 innings when pinch-hitter Jimmy Paredes lined a two-out, two-run double off Adam Warren, leaving the Yankees looking stunned and helpless as they walked off the field.But that was only the beginning. In the second game, the Orioles won, 5-0, to record their first doubleheader sweep of the Yankees since 1984. In 20 innings over roughly nine hours, the Yankees struck out 25 times and scored only once, as their already-slim playoff hopes dissipated even further.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s extremely frustrating,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Joe Girardi said after the first loss, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got some momentum after the way you\xe2\x80\x99ve won the last two games. But we weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to hold on to it.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Yankees were hoping \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps even expecting \xe2\x80\x94 to carry the momentum of Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s victory into Friday\xe2\x80\x99s doubleheader. They even had the benefit of a crucial 11th-inning home run from Chris Young, the charmed outfielder whose three-run blast the night before had secured arguably the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 most thrilling win of the season.But they could not capitalize on the momentum and now can only envy the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 October prospects, even given Davis\xe2\x80\x99s suspension.

He previously held a therapeutic use exemption, but it ran out and he did not have clearance at the time of testing. He is not appealing the suspension.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cI apologize to my teammates, coaches, the Orioles organization and especially the fans,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cI made a mistake by taking Adderall. I had permission to use it in the past, but do not have a therapeutic use exemption this year. I accept my punishment and will begin serving my suspension immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d Photo       The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Chris Davis in 2013, when he led the majors in home runs and runs batted in.

Division series are best of five; the American League Championship Series is best of seven. If the Orioles swept their first two series, Davis would still have to sit out Game 1 of the World Series.

I know Chris is too. It is what it is. So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to try to deal with it and move on. The timing is never good, but it\xe2\x80\x99s one of those challenges. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have this in place, and we\xe2\x80\x99re fully supportive of it. These are the things everybody knew about beforehand, and it\xe2\x80\x99s another way we want the fans to be able to trust a lot of things.\xe2\x80\x9dShowalter said Davis had telephoned him about 8 p.m. Thursday to notify him of the suspension. He was not at Camden Yards to address the situation Friday morning.

I know he called some of the players last night.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Davis is normally the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first baseman, but he recently moved to third base after Manny Machado sustained a season-ending knee injury. A year ago, Davis hit 53 home runs, knocked in 138 runs and had 370 total bases, all major league highs. He batted .286 that year with a 1.004 on-base plus slugging percentage. This year his numbers have declined. He has 26 home runs and 182 total bases and has struck out 173 times, the most in baseball. His O.P.S., so impressive last season, fell to .704 this year.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But the Orioles did just fine in their first game without him, even though they did not score until after Young\xe2\x80\x99s home run, his third in three games. On Thursday, the Yankees were trailing the Tampa Bay Rays by two runs in the bottom of the ninth when Young hit his three-run homer, and it appeared that his bases-empty shot would be enough on Friday, too.But the Orioles, held scoreless by a combination of Brandon McCarthy, Dellin Betances and David Robertson, did their damage against Warren. Girardi elected to use his best relief pitchers, Betances and Robertson, to get out of jams in the eighth and ninth, with the hope that Warren could close the game.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But he walked the leadoff batter, Nelson Cruz, and it would cost him the game. Cruz was replaced by pinch-runner David Lough, who was sacrificed to second. Warren then hit J. J. Hardy with a pitch and struck out Kelly Johnson for the second out. But he walked Steve Clevenger to load the bases.Then on the first pitch, Paredes lined a ball into right field, scoring Lough and Hardy to complete the comeback and start the celebration with most of the Orioles players, except for Davis.The Orioles lost a crucial member of their team Friday morning, but they were the ones smiling Friday afternoon.

Why? Anyone who loves the Orioles should be glad he\xe2\x80\x99s retiring,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt should be more like, good riddance. He has been a thorn for a long, long time.\xe2\x80\x9dShowalter, who was Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s first manager in the major leagues, back in 1995, could not have said it better. During most of Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s career, Jeter and the Yankees used the Orioles as their personal American League doormat. Example: Game 1 of the 1996 A.L. championship series.

Maier reached over the wall and grabbed the ball, and what might have been a long fly ball out was ruled a home run. The Yankees won the game, then the series.The thorn otherwise known as Derek Jeter would not soon be forgotten in this city.Some longtime Orioles fans on Friday described Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s home run in 1996 as heartbreaking, a killer, devastating, a back-breaker \xe2\x80\x94 and also used some colorful adjectives that cannot be printed here.Larry Beaver, a Baltimore firefighter and lifelong Orioles fan, gave me the stink eye from his seat next to the Yankees dugout when asked about Jeter and his unforgettable home run.

At the same time, about 200 miles northeast, the Yankees and Jeter, their young superstar, were loudly celebrating their successes, about to win their second of four World Series titles in five years.Again and again, for a little more than a season and a half\xe2\x80\x99s worth of games, the Orioles were forced to face Jeter and endure his tough play. Entering this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s series, he had put up solid numbers against the Orioles, hitting .299, with 68 doubles, 24 home runs and a .368 on-base percentage.

In a 5-0 loss that completed a doubleheader sweep by the Orioles, Jeter struck out once and grounded out three times.

First off let me state that I\xe2\x80\x99m a huge fan of the concept of the Sunday night game, and thus Baltimore Orioles fans should be honored to see the Birds being showcased like this. The idea of course is that most teams play afternoon games on Sundays, save for the one \xe2\x80\x9cgame of the week\xe2\x80\x9d which airs on national TV in prime time.\xc2\xa0Photo courtesy of ESPNNevertheless, I had the opportunity to speak over the telephone with the aforementioned Dan Shulman, who of course is \xe2\x80\x9cThe Voice of Sunday Night Baseball.\xe2\x80\x9d I feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s good for Orioles fans to get a national perspective on the team, as I suspect that many folks are tired of hearing people like me talk and write about them! However national pundits such as Mr. Shulman will always have a wider view of any team and/or players, so it\xe2\x80\x99s always interesting to hear their opinions. Below is an outline/summary of my conversation with Mr. Shulman:Domenic: With Chris Tillman on the mound for the Orioles tonight, how does he stack up compared to most of the \xe2\x80\x9caces\xe2\x80\x9d that you see league-wide?Dan Shulman:\xc2\xa0Tillman doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the career accomplishments of a Max Scherzer or Justin Verlander as of yet for sure. But he\xe2\x80\x99s a guy to whom you can give the ball on a weekly basis and get a good quality start. Based on his statistics of late, he\xe2\x80\x99s as much of an ace as any of those guys.Domenic:\xc2\xa0Do you feel that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that the Orioles need to do to make themselves a more complete team prior to the postseason?Dan Shulman: The Orioles have had a great season,\xc2\xa0 and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten enough credit for how things have gone. When you combine the fact that Davis hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been what he was expected to be, Machado\xe2\x80\x99s injuries plus suspension, Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 injury, etc, they\xe2\x80\x99re a very good team and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t received the credit that they deserve to this point. If there\xe2\x80\x99s one concern out there it might be their reliance on the home run ball to score so many of their runs, but they\xe2\x80\x99re finding ways to win and the fact is that they don\xe2\x80\x99t get enough credit for that.Domenic: In going around the league each week with Sunday Night Baseball, how do you feel that Adam Jones stacks up compared to some of the other center fielders league-wide?Dan Shulman: Similar to the team overall Adam Jones doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get enough credit for being the great center fielder that he is. I think that he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best players in baseball.\xc2\xa0Domenic: With the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen being as strong as it is, how big of an advantage can that be in a post season series?Dan Shulman: Everyone knows how important a decent closer is, and the Orioles have a good one in Zach Britton. But I think that the 7th\xc2\xa0and 8th\xc2\xa0inning guys are equally if not more important to a team. A bullpen of their caliber is a huge advantage in October. Andrew Miller was a great acquisition and it\xe2\x80\x99s solidified their pen moreso than it already was. That combined with the likes of Hunter, O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Britton, and Matusz makes them very formidable, espcially with the three lefties.Domenic: What are the odds of seeing a Beltway World Series?\xc2\xa0Dan Shulman: It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly very possible. Washington is probably the best team in the National League and they have a great roster. The Angels and Dodgers are certainly another local matchup that could occur, as are the Giants and A\xe2\x80\x99s. You never know what happens once you get into October and how things shake down, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a huge surprise.On a personal note, I watch Sunday Night Baseball every Sunday evening after my duties for Birds Watcher are complete; so this was a thrill for me to speak with Mr. Shulman, and on behalf of Birds Watcher and the Fansided Network I really appreciated the time that he gave me.Obviously this conversation took place prior to the announcement of Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 suspension, but obviously that would have worked right into his commentary of how the Orioles are underrated based on the number of big-name players who are missing. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stress enough how complimentary he was of the O\xe2\x80\x99s; when I asked if there was anything that they needed to improve upon overall he almost struggled to come up with something! In fact my response to him was that I thought the bit about relying on home runs was a fair criticism, and he was very quick to correct me and say that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t being critical \xe2\x80\x93 just offering commentary!His views on the bullpen were also very interesting to me. He was very complimentary of the arms that Buck Showalter has out there, as well as how they\xe2\x80\x99re used. My overall takeaway from the conversation was that he really likes and respects the way the Orioles play. The word\xc2\xa0underrated came up several times, both in relation to Adam Jones and in the team overall.I also want to mention that Curt Schilling will make his 2014 debut in the booth tonight with Dan Shulman, John Kruk, and Buster Olney after battling cancer for some time. As the son of a cancer survivor, I tip my cap to him and wish him well. The game of course begins at 8 PM, and will be preceeded by Baseball Tonight Sunday Night Countdown at 7 PM with Karl Ravech and Hall of Famer Barry Larkin. Once again, my thanks to Dan Shulman for being so gracious and taking the time to speak with me.

Hardy (2) after hitting a solo home run in the sixth inning against the New York Yankees at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Yankees won 3-2. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt may seem like an absolutely ridiculous question to ask if the Baltimore Orioles have enough offense to be a seriously competitive playoffs team. After all, this is the American League team with close to 30 more home runs on the season than the nearest competitor.However, it is not an infrequent occurrence that the Orioles struggle to score many runs and are shut down rather effectively by quality pitching \xe2\x80\x93 the category of pitching sure to be seen in the playoffs. The last three games against the Yankees are an example. It was nice to have scored five runs in the nightcap of the doubleheader, but only two runs could be mustered in each of the other two games. The O\xe2\x80\x99s were fortunate to get the timely hit by Paredes (after Yankees pitching loaded the bases) and escape the 11th inning Friday afternoon with a win.Adding to this question is the recent loss of Chris Davis due to his suspension. Though .196 is a sickly-looking batting average, and though the Orioles are 16-5 in his absence this year, he did account for 26 home runs and 72 RBIs. He remained a fearsome figure in the O\xe2\x80\x99s lineup that could haunt a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s psyche about what could happen with one swing of the bat. \xc2\xa0There is nothing quite like trying to win a world championship with three All-Stars out for the season!And beyond Davis is the continuing cumulative loss of Manny Machado and Matt Wieters. Nothing quite like trying to win a championship with a team that is missing three All-Stars! Without doubt, it would make for a great storyline \xe2\x80\xa6 which is my great hope as a writer.So what about the question that I pose? I recently have put a couple of articles on a site called \xe2\x80\x9cReddit.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m still not quite sure I understand the site, but it is an open forum to be highly criticized if it is anything. I entitled a recent article \xe2\x80\x9cHas Nelson Cruz Carried the Orioles in 2014?\xe2\x80\x9d And a commenter there went off on an academic discussion about how questions asked in titles of articles are known to anticipate answers in the negative.I am truly asking the question without a definitive answer in mind. I am not suggesting that the Orioles do not have sufficient scoring punch, even in light of the personnel losses. But it is true that the good O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching since early June has likely done most to boost the Orioles to a current sum of 88 wins with 14 games to play.Within the American League, it would probably be accurate to rate the overall Orioles offence as about #5 or #6. While they have the most home runs, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are lowest in team speed and triples. They are 10th in doubles and 13th in walks. In a number of categories the Orioles rank fifth overall \xe2\x80\x93 such as in average runs per game, total runs, hits, and batting average. Again, it altogether sums up as about fifth, or maybe sixth in the league.There is certainly enough talent on this roster to take 13-14 quality hitters into the rounds of the playoffs. However, the primary players are going to be needing to perform at a high level, and the \xe2\x80\x9cfiller\xe2\x80\x9d players will be called upon to contribute sufficiently to keep the lineup turning over.I think we could identify five primary players who will need to be the backbone to carry this offence: Nelson Cruz, Adam Jones, Nick Markakis, Steve Pearce and Nick Markakis. The Baltimore Orioles will need most of these five to be hitting well going into the playoffs. So how are they doing over the past 20 games? \xc2\xa0 More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterCruz \xe2\x80\x93 .304 \xe2\x80\x93 with five home runsJones \xe2\x80\x93 .263Markakis \xe2\x80\x93 .153Pearce \xe2\x80\x93 .290Hardy \xe2\x80\x93 .261Though none of us would have imagined this just a few weeks ago, the best of the rest would appear to be Alejandro De Aza. Since joining the Orioles he has played nine games and is 13-for-37 (.351). His speed is an asset, as well as his defense and left-handed bat. He will be in the lineup.Filling in the holes at second base and third base will be some mixture of Jonathan Schoop, Ryan Flaherty, Jimmy Paredes and Kelly Johnson. Schoop is currently in a pretty serious funk at only 3-for-35 in his past nine games (.210 on the season), whereas Flaherty has picked it up lately and has 10 hits over his past 24 at-bats. Paredes has played well since coming to the Orioles (11-for-28), though his career numbers are not stellar, as is true also of Johnson.Caleb Joseph has struggled more of late, though he is the better defensive catcher. Nick Hundley has hit much better over the past month. They will likely continue to split time into the playoffs, but the Orioles need offensive contributions from them to be successful.We are in an era with decreased offensive production, and playoffs offense is generally even less per game than in the regular season. Can the Orioles produce enough, while hoping also that the pitching holds on to its current level of quality performance?What do y\xe2\x80\x99all think?

East leaders, and five teams were ahead of them in the wild-card standings. The odds were long and the skepticism of the fans high, but the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 manager, Joe Girardi, said they had conceded nothing yet.\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have any other choice but to keep fighting,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said before the game. \xe2\x80\x9cOther teams are having their issues, and why not? You run off a streak, and you\xe2\x80\x99re back in it. Yesterday was physically a hard day and emotionally and mentally a hard day, but this team has bounced back before, and I expect them to do it.\xe2\x80\x9dOn Saturday, they did, beating the Orioles, 3-2, behind a strong performance from starting pitcher Shane Greene, a critical save by David Robertson and more innovative scoring from Chris Young, a Mets castoff who has reinvigorated the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 moribund offense.

As soon as he started running and Orioles catcher Caleb Joseph threw to second, Young took off for home, and he beat the return throw back to Joseph. Young, who has 130 career stolen bases, said he had stolen home before \xe2\x80\x94 maybe once.\xe2\x80\x9cIt definitely doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen every day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNormally they don\xe2\x80\x99t throw the ball with a guy like Antoan on first base, but I was happy they did.\xe2\x80\x9dOn Friday, Young had what would have been the winning hit in the first game of a doubleheader \xe2\x80\x94 an 11th-inning home run \xe2\x80\x94 if only the Yankees had held on to win.

Brian McCann had started the inning with a home run, and Mark Teixeira, who walked, scored on Richardson\xe2\x80\x99s single. The Yankees had their allotment of runs. Now it was up to their pitching to make it hold up.Greene, an unflappable rookie who struck out nine and improved to 4-0 on the road, let the Orioles score in the third when Nick Markakis, who had singled, ran home from second on a base hit by Nelson Cruz. Greene also allowed a double to Steve Pearce before setting down J. J. Hardy, the first of eight straight batters he retired, five by strikeout.The run ended with Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s bases-empty home run with one out in the sixth, which signaled the end for Greene.

[Editorial]Our view: At age 200, the national anthem still speaks to a nation\'s perseverance, pride and gratitudeSeptember 14, 2014Whether ""Baltimore \xe2\x80\x94 Birthplace of the Star-Spangled Banner"" is destined to become the city\'s official motto, as the City Council recently endorsed, is less important than a troubling bit of information that arose during the council\'s debate over the matter. Polls suggest only about one in five people living in Baltimore know of the city\'s link to the national anthem and even fewer are aware of it outside this state.This weekend\'s festivities may change that \xe2\x80\x94 although probably modestly so given that the PBS\' Great Performances series doesn\'t exactly have the ratings of a ""reality"" TV show, let alone a major sporting event. That a 35-year-old lawyer named Francis Scott Key wrote a poem 200 years ago today as a tribute to what he had witnessed the day before \xe2\x80\x94 the day-long barrage of Fort McHenry by shells and rockets during what would later be known as the Battle of Baltimore \xe2\x80\x94 deserves greater recognition.As national anthems go, ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" is not ideal. It\'s notoriously difficult to sing; the range required is too great and the lyrics too difficult for some to remember. The battle it commemorates is a forgotten one in a war about which there are ambivalent feelings. At best, the War of 1812 reaffirmed American independence. It is a conflict upstaged in the history books by the Revolutionary War before it and the Civil War after. var adSkipCounter = 0; But that is no excuse for the average denizen of this city to know the national anthem only as the song in which one expresses pride in the Baltimore Orioles baseball team by shouting, ""O!"" in the second-to-last verse, as in, ""O! say does that star-spangled banner yet wave."" The Star-Spangled Banner is Baltimore\'s. It was written here. The battle it commemorates was fought here. Even the giant flag that Key saw that day was created here by a 29-year-old widow named Mary Young Pickersgill. It ought to be as closely identified with Charm City as steamed crabs and cold beer.Americans sing this song frequently, but do they listen closely to it? The tune itself is a hand-me-down, derived from an uplifting, slightly bawdy little ditty called the ""The Anacreontic Song"" written for an exclusive gentleman\'s club (a place for the affluent to drink and sing, mostly) in London and adapted frequently by others including in America. Mr. Key\'s words are what really matter. After the devastating bombardment he had witnessed, he was obviously stunned to see the young nation\'s flag still flying the morning of Sept. 14.This is why the anthem can still inspire, not merely because it celebrates a little-known battle in an often-forgotten war but because it speaks to the American character. We overcome the adversity thrown at us, we persevere, we stand united, we do not retreat in the face of danger and we should be grateful for our blessings. ""O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand/Between their loved home and the war\'s desolation,"" the author\'s infrequently heard fourth verse observes. ""Blest with vict\'ry and peace, may the Heav\'n rescued land/Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!""In an era when threats are far less certain than British ships on the Patapsco, such a message of determination and resolve still resonates exactly 200 years later. Such a nation can overcome terrorists, whether they come from Iraq or Syria or closer to home. It can stand up to dictators and despots. It can set a shining example of freedom and democracy to the world. This is the inspiring message of the anthem, and it ought to be forever remembered not only by the citizens of Baltimore but by an entire country, and with great pride.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:The old oyster R-month rulePriest at once defended, excoriatedArundel\'s Hibbs loses scholarship to Florida State after drug arrestA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

The Orioles defeated the Yankees 3-2. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAs a nearly life-long Baltimore Orioles fan, I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually hate the New York Yankees. Yes, there are a few players here and there that are a bit distasteful, and a manager whose ego could only fit in NYC. And then there is the money spending thing that upsets the equilibrium of the game, although that activity may be catching up with the franchise at this point of history.As a baseball fan and purist, what I have always admired about the Yankees over the years \xe2\x80\x93 even as it was annoying in the extreme to watch \xe2\x80\x93 was the ability to come from behind at the end of a game. They did not always come back and win a game in which they were trailing, but they always put a guy or two on base and made a legit run at pulling it out. It was the Yankee way; they knew they were going to do it, and you knew it was going to happen also.

After a scoreless game until a Yankees solo home run in the top of the 11th, the Birds worked counts into getting the NY pitchers to load the bases for a two-out hit by Jimmy Paredes to win the game.And on Sunday night, it was consecutive doubles by Nelson Cruz, Steve Pearce, and Kelly Johnson that brought them back from the 2-1 deficit that had opened on them in the top of the inning by the Brian McCann homer.This is a \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s it going to be tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d sort of clubhouse, where anyone on the team can be the guy to make the difference in a game. And that is the character of a winning outfit. \xc2\xa0Imagine watching Endy Chavez and Wilson Betemit combining to beat the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the 9th inning!Imagine what watching Pearce and Johnson beat them must feel like for the Yankees! Johnson hit .219 for them in 77 games, and Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s average in NY was .160.\xc2\xa0 As an illustration, I think it would be like watching a rival team come to town and have Endy Chavez and Wilson Betemit engineer a come-from-behind victory over the O\xe2\x80\x99s.While singing the praises here of the offense in the ninth inning, it is still a bit scary that the Orioles only managed a total of 12 runs in four games and 37 innings against the Yankees. However, the O\xe2\x80\x99s were able to get three wins by holding the Yanks to a mere six runs in 38 innings of play. That is impressive, even though admittedly the NY offense is not that daunting right now.There is every reason with this Orioles team to stay in your seats at Camden Yards until the final out is registered. It is not like the old days where you might get a head start on the traffic by leaving after the eighth inning with the O\xe2\x80\x99s trailing. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), (""The Baltimore Orioles Just Don't Lose"", 'What a run it has been for the Baltimore Orioles here in 2014. With not very high expectations being put upon them prior to the season, they have far\xc2\xa0exceeded them and have surprised everyone.Forget about that fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re without three of their best players, it\xe2\x80\x99s still amazing that they\xe2\x80\x99re currently 30 games over .500 at 90-60. On top of that, they have been without starting catcher Matt Wieters for almost the entire season, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have starting third baseman Manny Machado on the team for over half the season, Chris Davis missed about two months and is in the midst of a 25-game suspension, and shortstop J.J. Hardy has missed many games this year as well.If I would have told you all that before the season and also would have told you that the Orioles would have the second-best record in baseball with all that occurring, you would have thought I was a little off?However, the more players they lose, the more they win. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense.More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterWieters goes, then\xc2\xa0Caleb Joseph emerges as a spectacular defensive catcher with some power at the plate. They lose Hardy and Machado, and Steve Pearce turns into Ted Williams. Chris Davis gets injured, then Delmon Young comes in and\xc2\xa0records a hit nearly ever third time he steps to the plate. Their $50 million man \xe2\x80\x93 Ubaldo Jimenez, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t contributed at all to the team\xe2\x80\x99s success. How are they winning and how is this occurring?The answer is very simple and that\xe2\x80\x99s their rotation. The five men on the current staff consist of Chris Tillman, Wei-Yin Chen, Kevin Gausman, Bud Norris, and Miguel Gonzalez. This rotation has looked almost as good as the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 rotation in the 70\xe2\x80\x99s, when they had Jim Palmer, Dave McNally and Mike Cuellar. The first group of names aren\xe2\x80\x99t quite as known as the second group.However, they look pretty close to it. Not a single pitcher on the starting staff has an ERA higher then 3.80 at the moment, and three of them have ERA\xe2\x80\x99s lower than 3.50. They have undoubtedly been carrying this Baltimore Orioles team this season.Over the last two months, the Orioles just can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to lose, no matter who they do loseOver the last two months, the Orioles just can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to lose, no matter who they do lose. Despite missing their starting third baseman who led the league in doubles last year, their starting first baseman who led the league in home runs last year, and their starting catcher who has hit the second-most home runs for a backstop\xc2\xa0over the last three years, they are still rolling.They have over double as many wins as losses, as they have maintained a 37-18 record since the All-Star break. Perhaps an even more impressive number is that they are 18-5 on the season without starting first baseman Chris Davis in the lineup. If they would have missed Chris Davis for 23 games last season, their record would have been 5-18 in those games.Will Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 suspension hurt? Yes. Will they miss Manny Machado in the infield? Yes. Would they desperately have rather had\xc2\xa0Matt Wieters in the backstop than Caleb Joseph or Nick Hundley? Absolutely. But with the way the pitching has been performing, they can still be serious threats to win a championship.The only question that remains is if this shut-down pitching will carry into the playoffs. If it does, the Orioles will be well on their way to the 2014 World Series.

Right now, his FIP is equal to last year\'s, but he\'s of course getting there differently, walking fewer while surrendering more home runs. Some of the more complex ERA estimators, such as xFIP (3.76) and SIERA (3.85), which factor in HR/FB% and ball-in-play types, respectively, suggest that his ERA isn\'t just lucky. Stroman began his rookie season in Toronto\'s bullpen before switching to starting full-time at the end of May. He started off well, with nine of his first eleven starts being ""quality"" ones, but then had a messy August, giving up five-plus runs in three of five games. His last start was a gem, though, as he shut out the Cubs for his second complete game, limiting them to three hits and striking out eight. Stroman throws lots of fastballs, roughly 40% four-seamers and 15% each sinkers and cutters to all batters. His curveball is his out pitch, again regardless of batter handedness, and he throws it 16% of the time. Lefties will also see changeups early in the count, while fellow righties will get the odd slider regardless of count. Tuesday, September 16, 7:05 ET: Ubaldo Jimenez vs. Drew Hutchison      Jimenez Hutchison   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 182.2 114.1 - 169.1   ERA 3.30 4.96 - 4.36   FIP 3.43 4.81 - 3.78   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .239/.317/.367 .252/.360/.401 - .246/.307/.410         Jimenez will be making his first start since August 16, and he\'s only pitched twice since then. In a closer race, I\'d be questioning Buck\'s judgment here, but with a large division lead and little chance of passing the Angels for MLB\'s best record, there isn\'t much to lose in turning to Jimenez over McFarland, Brach, Saunders, or someone not currently on the active roster.    Hutchison\'s been on a bit of a roll lately, recording four straight quality starts, and giving up just five runs in those outings while striking out 32 in 25.1 IP. Of the Orioles with fifteen-plus plate appearances against him (Markakis, Jones, Hardy, and Cruz), all have a sub-.550 OPS. Hutchison throws 50% four-seam fastballs, but otherwise takes different approaches against lefties and righties. The former get about 20% each sinkers and changeups, plus about 10% sliders, mostly once Hutchison\'s already ahead in the count. Fellow righties see 35% sliders and 10% sinkers, with little variance depending on count. Maybe hot: Colby Rasmus (1.155 OPS, 29 PA) Likely not: Jose Bautista (.279 OPS, 26 PA) Wednesday, September 17, 7:05 ET: Bud Norris vs. J.A.

In the three starts before that, he twice gave up four runs in six innings to the Rays, but shut out the Reds for six in the other. Happ\'s most recent start was his best in a while, a one-run, seven-inning, seven-strikeout affair. Prior to that, he hovered around the line for quality starts for three outings, giving up ten runs over nineteen innings. Happ throws a lot of fastballs, using offspeed pitches just 12% of the time against fellow lefties and 23% of the time versus righties. He uses his four-seamer most often (51% vs. R, 63% vs. L), and his sinker and cutter another 25% of the time (lefties see an even mix, while righties get mostly sinkers). Righties get occasional changeups in all counts, and both get curevballs about 12% of the time, mostly as an out pitch.

While mathematically they\xe2\x80\x99re still alive for a playoff spot and they certainly have to play every game as such, if you look at the math is stands to reason that the end is near. The Baltimore Orioles on the other hand are playing for the division. Going into last night\xe2\x80\x99s game before a national television audience the magic number was four. A win would knock it down to three, with the team that they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to eliminate (Toronto) coming to town this week.The O\xe2\x80\x99s got a solid outing from Chris Tillman, who helped to solidify his ace status before the eyes of the entire nation in prime time last night. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.2 IP, 5 H, 1R, 1 BB, 6K. Tillman had one tough inning, which was the second. Martin Prado homered to lead off the inning and to put the O\xe2\x80\x99s in a 1-0 hole. New York would proceed to put runners at the corners with nobody out, but Tillman would find a way to strike out two and to induce a fly out to get out of the inning.And from that point on there were lots of zeros across-the-board that were put up. On occasion someone would get on base, and perhaps even into scoring position. But this was a pitchers duel between Tillman and NY starter Hiroki Kuroda, and both starters held up their end of the bargain. However the Birds finally broke through and tied the game in the sixth. Alejandro De Aza knotched a one-out single, and he scored on Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-double to tie the game.As generally happens in the AL East, this game went down to the end \xe2\x80\x93 which featured a flurry of action. Again, this game was almost meaningless in the sense that NY has as tough a road as anyone to make it to the post season, and it appears to only be a matter of time before the Orioles clinch. So Orioles fans shou.ldn\xe2\x80\x99t have felt horrible when Brian McCann homered in the top of the ninth to give them a 2-1 lead. New York fans in attendance seemed to think it was a huge clutch moment, however in reality McCann could do that every game for the rest of the season and New York still might end up missing the playoffs. But they all forgot one thing\xe2\x80\xa6home team bats last.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsNY closer Dave Robertson was brought in for a third consecutive day, and it was immediately evident that he was somewhat fatigued. Nelson Cruz led off the inning with a double to left, putting the tying run in scoring position. He was immediately lifted for pinch runner Quentin Barry, who scored to tie the game on Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-double. That brought \xe2\x80\x9cMr. AL East\xe2\x80\x9d himself, Kelly Johnson, to the plate with the chance to win the game for his new team against one of his old teams\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and what did we think was going to happen?! As the song tells us,\xc2\xa0every game has a different star. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single scored Pearce from second and sent the Camden faithful into a late-night frenzy as the Orioles defeated NY 3-2. Moments like that are special, especially at the end of seasons that could be shaping up to be special.  However that combined with the fact that it was in prime time on Sunday night make it all the more impressive for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Keep in mind that teams like New York and Boston would routinely do that type of thing to the Orioles for so long. So by creating that moment, the Orioles also put the entire nation on notice that there\xe2\x80\x99s a new sherrif in the American League East. And sherrif with a little magic up his sleeve to say the least\xe2\x80\xa6Orioles Magic at that.Before the game the Orioles presented retiring NY Yankee Derek Jeter with a check for his foundation, along with a bushel of crabs and a crab mallet that was presented personally by former Oriole Boog Powell. Overall the Orioles fans were incredibly respectful of the fact that it was Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s last game at Camden Yards. While Jeter broke many Camden hearts over the years, there are certain players who transcend the lines of fandom, and he\xe2\x80\x99s one of them. There are few players who did it as well and with as much class as Jeter, who\xe2\x80\x99s a sure first-ballot hall of famer.While Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day got the win, Andrew Miller\xe2\x80\x98s 1.1 IP were as important as anything else last night. As ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Dan Shulman told me in my discussion with him last week, the 7th and 8th inning guys are just as if not more important than the closer. Miller\xe2\x80\x99s been one of the best in-season aquisitions that any team has made this year, and he\xe2\x80\x99s very quietly fit in very nicely in the clubhouse and on this team.The O\xe2\x80\x99s open up a three-game set with Toronto tonight at the yard, with the magic number once again being three. A win tonight and tomorrow night would clinch the AL East crown and thus a playoff spot for the Orioles. Wei-Yin Chen is on the mound tonight, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Marcus Stroman of Toronto. Game time is set for just after 7 PM.

Other pitchers have thrown more. Roger Clemens had more than 4,000 innings \xe2\x80\x94 all in Major League Baseball \xe2\x80\x94 while he was still 40, and Hideo Nomo recorded 3,0272/3, including 9761/3 in Japan.

He threw seven strong innings, allowed only one run and walked none, and did not get a win.

His career earned run average of 3.47 would normally indicate a better won-loss record, but Kuroda has often suffered from lack of run support, going back to his days in Los Angeles.

He has also been a hard-luck pitcher much of the time.Thirty of his 79 losses going into Sunday had come in so-called quality starts, where he allowed three or fewer runs in at least six innings. He has also lost out on 23 potential wins in games that were lost by the bullpen when he was in a position to win it. Four of those have come this year.On Sunday, Kuroda was pitching on a knife\xe2\x80\x99s edge throughout. The Yankees scored first on Martin Prado\xe2\x80\x99s second-inning home run, and Kuroda made it stand for four innings until the Orioles finally broke through.

There was still only one out.

He also discussed his recent slump (he went 0 for 4 and is hitless in his last six games).\xe2\x80\x9cThe only result I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned about is us trying to win today,\xe2\x80\x9d he said before the game. \xe2\x80\x9cTrust me, I want to do probably better than most people every single time that I play.

First the pitchers actually tried to get Jeter out instead of letting him reach base, and the living legend went 0-for-4 on the night. Then they rudely scored two runs in the bottom of the ninth to win the game and send Jeter and his Yankees home sad, having lost three out of four games in the series. Did no one tell the Birds that this was Derek Jeter's special day? Seriously, though, this was one heck of a game that looked like it wouldn't end up in the O's favor. But then, all of the sudden, it did. Both Chris Tillman and Hiroki Kuroda pitched a heck of a game, limiting the opposing team to just one run. It ended up being a game decided with relief pitchers on the mound, and while both made mistakes, the O's got the last laugh. Let's start with Tillman. After an easy first inning, Martin Prado led off the second with a home run to left field. Replays showed that Alejandro De Aza probably should have made the catch. The ball landed in the first row as it sailed right next to De Aza's glove. John Lackey would call that a Camden Yards home run. It looked like the wheels might fall off for Tillman after that, but he got it together. Two batters after the home run the Yankees had runners on the corners with no outs thanks to two singles and a throwing error by De Aza (it was not the best inning he's ever had). But Tillman didn't allow another run to come in, sandwiching two strikeouts around a pop up to strand the runners. Tillman cruised through the next four innings, allowing just two baserunners. In the fifth inning, Stephen Drew hit an infield single against the shift, and in the sixth inning Prado singled on a ground ball that just evaded second baseman Jonathan Schoop. The Yankees just were not getting solid hits against him. Tillman hasn't been much of a strikeout pitcher this season, but he got six tonight, all of which were swinging. He definitely had the curve ball walking tonight.    Unfortunately, Kuroda was matching Tillman pitch for pitch. Through the first four innings, the Orioles had just one baserunner thanks to a J.J. Hardy double. Their second baserunner was also Hardy, who reached on an infield single in the fifth. With two outs, Nick Hundley blooped a single into right field, but Jonathan Schoop grounded out to strand them.    Finally in the sixth inning, the Orioles got on the board. De Aza singled to center and then came in to score all the way from first on a double down the left field line by Adam Jones. Pearce also reached base in the inning but one run was all they got. Tillman started the seventh inning and issued his very first walk of the game with one out. He walked Chris Young on a full count and then threw an absurd wild pitch that bounced way in front of the plate. Young went to second base, then to third on a ground out. Tillman looked pooped, and Buck Showalter pulled him in favor of Andrew Miller. Miller came in to face pinch hitter Carlos Beltran. Miller should have struck Beltran out looking on three pitches, but the umpire was so busy flinching at the nasty movement on Miller's slider that he missed the call. No matter, Miller just got Beltran out swinging on the very next pitch.       After Miller pitched an equally nasty top of the eighth, the Yankees countered with their own excellent relief pitcher. Dellin Betances came in to pitch in relief of Kuroda, and the Orioles couldn't do anything with him. Betances struck out both Nick Markakis and Adam Jones and got a fly ball out from De Aza. Betances looked outstanding, but thank goodness for the Orioles, Joe Girardi's binder says that David Robertson pitches the ninth inning. Both Zach Britton and Darren O'Day were warming up as the tie ballgame went into the ninth inning. It was O'Day who got the call, and it turns out that was maybe the wrong decision. He did strike out Prado, but then gave up a home run to Brian McCann. That gave the Yankees a 2-1 lead and made me sad. O'Day also looked sad, but he got out of the inning without any more trouble. The great thing about this team is that they're not out of the game until the 27th out is made. And the lucky thing for the Orioles was that Girardi pulled Betances for closer David Robertson, who had already pitched on the previous two days. Robertson looked like he was going to walk Nelson Cruz, but on a 3-1 count Cruz went to left field with a leadoff double. Quintin Berry replaced Cruz at second, then Steve Pearce hit a double of his own. Cruz probably could have scored on that, but it's fun to see Berry run really fast.    With the game tied, J.J. Hardy tried to move the runner up but failed, hitting a fly ball out to right field that Pearce could not advance on. But that's OK, J.J., because Kelly Johnson has your back! Johnson launched a ball into the right-center field gap that easily scored Steve Pearce. The O's ran out onto the field to mob Pearce at home plate and Johnson in the field. O's win! O's win! Never count this team out, guys. Tomorrow the Blue Jays come to town for a three-game set. If the Orioles can win the series, they'll clinch the American League East. I love baseball.

09/16/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles Win the American League East Championship', 'Sep 16, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles clinch the AL East championship after a game against the Toronto Blue Jays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles defeated the Jays 8-2. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are the American League East Division Champions. After thousands of articles written about the Baltimore Orioles over a period of years, I am finally able to write that glorious sentence!The O\xe2\x80\x99s took it to the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday night by defeating them 8-2, making Ubaldo Jimenez the unlikely winner of the clinching game in a season filled with unlikely heroes.Yes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe parade of the unlikely\xe2\x80\x9d continued at Oriole Park, with the indomitable Steve Pearce giving the Birds the lead with a three-run homer in the bottom of the first inning. Jimmy Paredes \xe2\x80\x93 having played most of the year in the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 farm system \xe2\x80\x93 added another run with an opposite-field solo shot. And the revived White Sox castoff Alejandro De Aza tripled home three runs in the seventh inning to drive a stake through the heart of the Jays and the AL East.When the Orioles win, as fans, we all share in it in some fractional way. Like me, I am sure that most of you are known in your families, communities, workplaces and associations as O\xe2\x80\x99s fans. You wear the gear; there is no doubt that it is a value to you. So when the team wins, you win.This website \xe2\x80\x93 The Baltimore Wire \xe2\x80\x93 is part of the FanSided Network. We write from the passionate perspective of the fans of our teams. So yes, when our team wins, we have a big part in the joy of the experience.It is right to celebrate, because it is very hard to win big things. As a much older-than-average Orioles blogger, let me give you a personal perspective.I like almost all sports, but I fell in love with baseball as a little boy in the 60s. By good luck, I was able to be in the stands for the fourth and final game of the 1966 World Series. It was an awesome experience for an 11-year-old.In my high school years, the Baltimore Orioles were the dominant team in baseball, winning the American League in 69, 70, and 71 \xe2\x80\xa6 along with the Series in 1970. I thought it would always be this way forever \xe2\x80\x93 the Orioles were clearly a dynasty.In my college years, the Orioles won a pair of AL East titles. But it was beginning to slip a bit. And then while I was in grad school in Texas, it was painful to watch the Pirates in 1979 beat them in the World Series.While I was busy building my first house and trying to get it done before winter, I took some time away to see the games in 1983 as they won their most recent Series.And then came the gaps\xe2\x80\xa6 14 years until 1997 \xe2\x80\x93 the most recent AL East championship \xe2\x80\xa6 and then the long 14 losing seasons until the wild card team of 2012. A full generation and more of Orioles fans have had little reason to be cheerful. For many of us, our children had no memory of a championship outfit.But a few years ago, I saw some young players who were intriguing; I liked what I was seeing, started a blog to write about it to anyone who would read it, later joined this network, and watched and wrote about more developments with the team. Adam Jones became the face of the organization with Nick Markakis as the foundation. The Orioles got a real manager who was a true baseball guy. Quality pieces were added from all over the world. The atmosphere had changed.Yes, here we are. We are a part of it. Celebrate in these days, for it is difficult to win. You cannot assume it will surely happen again soon.There is more work to do yet this year. The Orioles are one of 10 teams with a shot to win it all; it will be difficult. But it can be done. We\xe2\x80\x99ll think about all of that later.Right now FanSided Orioles followers, celebrate. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Prospect season in review: Hunter Harvey - Camden Chat', ' When the Orioles selected Hunter Harvey with the 22nd overall pick of the 2013 draft, he was just another name on the board. He wasn\'t exactly a diamond in the rough late-round pick; Harvey was seen as a consensus late first-round pick and, without any four year college commitment, there were no signability concerns with him. Anyone could have had him. He wanted to play pro ball. After mowing down Gulf Coast and New York-Penn League players for eight starts last year, Harvey got more attention on the prospect radar. One publication, Baseball Prospectus, rated him as the #58 prospect in all of baseball before this season. ESPN\'s Keith Law was even more aggressive in ranking Harvey,\xc2\xa0putting Harvey at #38 in his own list with the belief that Harvey could end up as a #1 or #2 starter, depending on the development of a changeup. Getting such a fast rising prospect at #22 overall is something most teams would dream about. The 2014 season was Harvey\'s first full season in professional ball. The 19-year-old Harvey spent the whole year pitching for the Low-A Delmarva Shorebirds. He was nearly three full years younger than the average player in that league. He did not look like it. Through 87.2 innings, he struck out 106 batters while holding up a 3.18 ERA. Harvey pitched so well that, in Law\'s midseason prospect ranking update, Law had moved Harvey up to\xc2\xa0the #13 prospect in all of baseball, with Law wondering why the Orioles had not moved Harvey up to Frederick or even Bowie. He believed that the South Atlantic League just couldn\'t challenge Harvey enough for him to develop that crucial changeup any further.    Unfortunately for Harvey and for the Orioles, he suffered an injury that became apparent during a start on July 25. He returned to Baltimore for an MRI that revealed what was alternately referred to as\xc2\xa0elbow inflammation and\xc2\xa0a flexor mass strain in his pitching arm. If they might have had any plans to challenge him at a higher level for the last month of the minor league season, they were scuttled by that injury.    The particular description of the flexor mass strain is something that will remain worrisome until Harvey is back and pitching and clearly healthy again. The injury suffered by Dylan Bundy that ultimately required Tommy John surgery was first diagnosed as\xc2\xa0flexor mass tightness. One key difference for Harvey is that he was not prescribed a platelet rich plasma injection; he was only told to rest and rehab the injury. That meant he was shut down for the rest of the minor league season from then on. It would be a huge disappointment if things go that direction with Harvey, but at least so far there\'s no indication that it will. That\'s just me being paranoid. I\'m going to stop being a downer.    Here\'s some video taken by Baseball America from a May 29 start against Wilmington: <object width=""425"" height=""350"" class=""mceItemFlash"">   <param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/mz7MO8Zyu3Y""></param>   <param name=""wmode"" value=""transparent""></param>   <embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/mz7MO8Zyu3Y"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent""     width=""425"" height=""350""></embed> </object> Hunter Harvey \xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore Orioles (via Baseball America)    Yeah, those are Low-A hitters, but look at him mowing down those guys. The curveball is a beautiful thing to see. These poor guys have no chance when he\'s getting that thing in there. It\'s the curveball that has created even more excitement about Harvey. In an August assessment of Harvey at fellow SB Nation blog Minor League Ball, Harvey has gone from ""a chance to have a Major League average curveball ... to discussion of whether Harvey\'s curveball is one of the better curveballs in the minor leagues."" After viewing Harvey in July,\xc2\xa0BPro\'s Tucker Blair pegged Harvey for a 2016 arrival in MLB, which would really be something. Blair liked, among other things, that Harvey has ""a quick delivery and works fast on the mound."" As Jim Palmer always says: Work fast, throw strikes, change speeds. Harvey has a chance to be able to do all of that. If he can develop a changeup the way that prospect evaluators seem to think he can, he\'ll be able to work with three speeds. When it comes to throwing strikes, Harvey has some more to work on that front at this point. He walked 33 batters in his 87.2 innings this year, which is on the higher end of what you\'d like to see, if not quite into Kevin Gregg or Ubaldo Jimenez territory. The minor leagues are there for learning, anyway.       It\'s always important to remember not to put too much stock in minor league numbers, good or bad. A player might look bad due to spending time working on a particular pitch during an outing. Good numbers could be due to accumulating gaudy stats against inferior competition. Still, it\'s not just the stat lines that are impressive for Harvey. People who make their livings evaluating prospects find much to be excited about with him. He was as high as #13 in Law\'s estimation at midseason. Perhaps he\'ll find himself just as high on next year\'s prospect list.    As long as he stays healthy, he should find himself starting out the season in Frederick and if he does well, maybe he\'ll end up the year in Bowie.

The A.L. game is first, on Sept. 30, and the N.L. game is the next night.

The Dodgers\xe2\x80\x99 Clayton Kershaw leads the majors in victories with 19; he has two starts left to win 20, despite missing April with an injury.

Mitchell Layton/Getty Images/AFP (AFP Photo/Mitchell Layton)More- After 17 years, the Baltimore Orioles are back on top of Major League Baseball's American League East division.Steve Pearce and Jimmy Paredes both homered to help the Orioles beat the Toronto Blue Jays 8-2 on Tuesday and clinch the AL East division crown for the first time since 1997.Baltimore's Ubaldo Jimenez overcame a shaky start and pitched five innings, allowing two runs on two hits with four walks and six strikeouts.While the Orioles won at home, the Washington Nationals secured the National League East division title in hostile territory \xe2\x80\x93 at defending champions Atlanta.Ian Desmond hit a two-run homer and Tanner Roark pitched seven scoreless innings as the Nationals beat the reeling Braves 3-0.AFP "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Hearts of champions - Birds Watcher', 'I thought long and hard all night about the title of this piece today; I\xe2\x80\x99m still not sure that I got it right. But come to think of it, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure there are words that could do justice to what we witnessed last night. A team that had stepped up big all year did it one more time to get through to the end in order to be crowned as champions. AL East champions to be exact \xe2\x80\x93 there\xe2\x80\x99s still some work to be done this year. However to the Baltimore Orioles themselves as well as to the people of Baltimore, it was a moment a long time in the making.Many fans were flabergasted to hear that manager Buck Showalter was starting Ubaldo Jimenez in a potential title-clinching game. First off, it was pretty simple; the Baltimore Orioles needed a spot starter. However while Jimenez had struggled all season without a doubt, there had to be a reason why he was brought to Baltimore. And we saw that reason unfold last night. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 2 H, 2 R, 4 BB, 6 K.Make no mistake about the fact that Jimenez struggled in this start. But he probably struggled less than he had in many other starts over the course of the year. At various points it appeared he was not long for the game. But the heart of a champion is a relentless one, and Jimenez hung in there. As did Showalter when it came to sending Jimenez back out in the fifth.  As I told many people yesterday: as much of a struggle as this year\xe2\x80\x99s been for him, if he wins this one game he\xe2\x80\x99s a hero tomorrow. With Toronto already leading 1-0, Steve Pearce stepped to the plate in the last of the first with two runners already on. Not one to be dwarfed by the limelight, Pearce delivered a three-run homer to thrust the Orioles into the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, 3-1. Toronto would net one more run in the second on a Reyes RBI-single, however the Birds would get that run back in the last of the inning on Jimmy Paredes\xe2\x80\x98 solo homer.The score stood at 4-2 through several scoreless innings. However there was still an uneasy tension in the air, as a two-run lead isn\xe2\x80\x99t much in MLB these days. With the bases loaded in the last of the seventh, Alejandro De Aza smacked his third triple in a week \xe2\x80\x93 this one of the bases-clearing variety. That gave the Birds a 7-2 lead, and effectively ended the competitive portion of the game. Nick Hundley would add \xc2\xa0a sac fly-RBI in the eighth, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s cruised to their first AL East title in 17 years with an 8-2 victory.What unfolded after the final out is a moment that will probably rank up there as one of the top moments in Baltimore sports history.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWhere as most teams pile on each other on the field to celebrate a championship and then go into the clubhouse for a champagne/beer soaked party, the O\xe2\x80\x99s proceeded to bring those beverages back onto the field to celebrate with the city and the fans. I suppose when you haven\xe2\x80\x99t clinched anything at home since 1969 and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been AL East champions since 1997, you\xe2\x80\x99re afforded that opportunity!A few takeaways so to speak: Adam Jones pieing fans, players celebrating with their kids, Nick Markakis (the longest tenured Oriole) realizing that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to the promised land for the first time in his career, and the Orioles fans getting to witness a moment so many years in the making. I suppose that the scene of the night would have to be Adam Jones running around the field with the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 champions flag gesturing towards the fans.As often as we see athletes engaging in so many ill activities (and of late no doubt), this Oriole team is a feel-good story. They\xe2\x80\x99ve re-captured the hearts and minds of Baltimore along with perhaps a few other folks nationwide. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve done so with the heart of a champion. Through so many losing seasons and embarrassing moments, this town and this franchise survived. So you can look at the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 story as perhaps synonymous with that of the city of Baltimore itself. They\xe2\x80\x99re a tough blue collar team that\xe2\x80\x99s managed to survive, and is now poised to go onwards and upwards. None of us knows where that journey ends \xe2\x80\x93 yet. However one thing is certain; it won\xe2\x80\x99t be in this month.The one thing that marred an otherwise unbelievable evening was the continuation of theatrics from Toronto pitchers. Nick Markakis was hit square in the back by Aaron Loup in the seventh inning (he was one of the runs that scored on De Aza\xe2\x80\x99s triple). It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear why Toronto seemingly has a problem with the Orioles, or even if they do at all. Keep in mind that Toronto is the team that the Orioles eliminated last night to take up their mantle of champions. So if that\xe2\x80\x99s their way of not going quietly into the night, they might want to take a look in the mirror and ask themselves what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing. Having said that, enough finally became enough in the eighth when Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day hit Jose Bautista, and both benches were warned.I would expect Buck Showalter to start giving some players games off with the division secured, and that may well start tonight. Piggybacking on what I just wrote above, the last thing the Orioles want is to have one of their regulars hurt if Toronto decides to start throwing at people again.

09/18/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Will Chris Davis be an Oriole in 2015?', 'Photo: Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY SportsA day after securing their first division title since 1997, Orioles fans got some more excitement when the organization promoted top hitting prospect Christian Walker. The move could just be the team rewarding Walker for an outstanding season. However, with slugger Chris Davis being suspended and lacking production for much of the season, the Orioles could be using the last two weeks of the season to showcase his future replacement. It would have been impossible to imagine after finishing 2013 with 53 homeruns that less than a season later his job could be in jeopardy, but his performance in 2014 has made it a conversation. Most Orioles fans are well aware of the numbers, and they are ugly to say the least. His .196 average is worst in the league and his 173 strikeouts are most in the league. Anyone would live with the strikeouts when you\xe2\x80\x99re hitting 53 homers and hitting .286 like he did in 2013, but not with his numbers this season. In Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 defense he has now missed games three times this season; once for an oblique injury, once for the birth of his son and now his amphetamines suspension. All together he was only available to play in 126 games. In his abbreviated season he did hit 26 homeruns and drove in 72 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s. So it would be hard to argue he had no production, but the Ks and average are a lot to overlook.Christian Walker on the other hand had an incredible year in the minors hitting 26 homeruns and driving in 96. There is no doubt with those numbers Walker can hit at the minor league level, but as baseball fans know that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always translate to the majors. Some people may have forgotten, but Lou Montanez once won the triple-crown in AA and Matt Wieters hit .355 in his only full season in the minors. Davis also has competition with the emergence of veteran Steve Pearce. The former utility man is now batting .297 and has hit 20 homeruns in only 97 games. The league has seen many players have successful seasons only to be unable to repeat them the following season, and that could easily be the case with Pearce. However, it is impossible to imagine watching everyday this season. Now with the acquisition of left-fielder Alejando De Aza, Pearce maybe limited to only first base. This season could just be an aberration and Davis could resemble the 2013 version of Chris Davis next season. However, with the emergence of Steve Pearce and prospect Christian Walker knocking on the door, Davis will have to show something special in spring training or his days in Baltimore could be numbered.  ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles call up Christian Walker - yahoo.com', 'Baltimore plans on auditioning the 23-year-old slugger over the final 11 games of the season.With Chris Davis\xc2\xa0now gone for the remainder of the season, the Baltimore Orioles have decided to call up first base prospect Christian Walker from Triple-A.\xc2\xa0As Roch Kubatko of MASNsports.com notes, Walker\'s promotion will enable the Orioles to give Steve Pearce some much-needed rest for the postseason.The loss of Davis has severely crippled the Orioles\' corner infield depth, and with the AL East division title already wrapped up, there is little risk in bringing up Walker to give Pearce some time off and see if he can hold his own at the highest level. The Orioles were in a similar situation last year, calling up Jonathan Schoop for a trial run in September. Surprisingly, Schoop made the Opening Day roster this season, and has been with the club ever since. The one questionable part of Walker\'s call-up is that he doesn\'t need to be placed on the 40-man roster until next year, though Davis\'s extension opens up a spot on the 40-man, so the Orioles don\'t have to risk losing anyone by adding Walker.The Orioles\' fourth round pick in the 2012 draft, Walker was rated by\xc2\xa0Baseball America as Baltimore\'s 18th best prospect entering the year. Scouts noted his gap-to-gap power but suggested the didn\'t have ""the power associated with the first-base profile."" Walker seems to have defied those comments this season, as he blasted 26 home runs and hit .288/.357/.489 in 599 plate appearances at Double and Triple-A. Some believe that he profiles as an average regular at the big league level.More from sbnation.com:MLB\'s best contracts: 10 deals that seem too good to\xc2\xa0be\xc2\xa0trueWhich teams can go worst to first in\xc2\xa02015?James Shields free agency\xc2\xa0previewThese contracts could cost their teams shot at MLB\xc2\xa0PlayoffsRed Sox 2014: Four reasons it all went\xc2\xa0wrongMax Scherzer free agency\xc2\xa0preview ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles &amp; Toronto Blue Jays: Ruffled Feathers', ""Sep 15, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter (26) argues with umpire Ted Barrett (65) after the sixth inning of the game against the Toronto Blue Jays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Baltimore Orioles defeated Toronto Blue Jays 5-2. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsA lot of feathers were flying over the past several days of the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 three-game sweep of the Toronto Blue Jays at Camden Yards.From what I know of the natural world of ornithology, if a blue jay and an oriole got into a bird fight, the jay would beat the crap out of the little orange bird.But that is not exactly what happened in Baltimore since the beginning of this week. The Baltimore Orioles took three straight by scores of 5-2, 8-2, and 6-1. That adds up to 19-5 and quite a pile of blue feathers to sweep up on this off day before the Red Sox come to town to finish the home schedule. \xc2\xa0Live Feed Steve PearceBlue Jays' Pearce finally showing life with the bat Jays JournalFantasy Baseball 2017: Early Waiver Wire Pickups Ahead of Week 2 Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBlue Jays releasing Justin Smoak not a viable immediate solution Jays JournalBlue Jays\xe2\x80\x99 front office shows again its ability to act quickly Jays JournalToronto Blue Jays: First Base and Left Field Tip of the TowerBlue Jays: Still in on Angel Pagan for left field? Jays JournalSurely there is also more residue to clean up from Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s AL East championship-clinching celebration that went from the field, to the locker room, and back to the field again.Though kudos could be shared throughout the Orioles roster for significant contributions that led to this title and this series sweep, but particular commendation goes to Steve Pearce. Over the three games, Peace was 5-for-9 with three walks. He hit three home runs with a total of seven RBIs. So yes, he himself outscored the Jays 7-5. It was impressive.But among the post-series plumes on the field are some orange and black feathers as well. These quills came loose particularly with some high and nasty fastballs, including three of the nastiest head-hunter pitches you will ever see.Marcus Stroman began it on Monday evening by slipping a 93-MPH four-seamer just behind Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s head, apparently in retaliation for the offence taken earlier in the game by Jose Reyes \xe2\x80\x93 who perceived Joseph to be blocking the plate on a head-first slide and stepping on his hand.Major League Baseball determined it to be intentional with a six-game suspension, which Stroman has appealed. Has anyone ever admitted that they did it? It would seem good to me if the Orioles can avoid seeing this loose canon again this year. Even if his appeal is not settled before the end of the season, and if the Jays stick to a strict five-man rotation, Stroman would appear to pitch again against the Yankees on Sunday and then the Mariners next Thursday before the final three games of the season. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens.Speaking of loose canons, another is Jays reliever Aaron Sanchez, who nearly decapitated Steve Pearce with a 96-mph heater, after earlier hitting Jonathan Schoop. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterAnd in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s clinching game, Nick Markakis managed to turn his back to a chin-high screamer from Aaron Loup, clearly taking a terribly nasty hit that knocked the wind out of him.I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how Buck Showalter managed to hold himself together as well as he did. Probably the only actual intentional pitch was likely the first of these by Stroman; but whether on purpose or not, the season-ending potential can be the same.

Haddix pitched in the majors for 14 seasons, his final two with the O's in 1964-5. On this day in 2012, Taylor Teagarden had a pinch-hit RBI single in the 18th inning to give the Orioles a 4-2 lead over the Mariners. Shockingly, Jesus Montero did not come back in the bottom of the inning to hit a walk off and the Orioles won the marathon game. (As always, thanks to\xc2\xa0Baseball Reference for the birthdays and history lessons)  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: AL East champs sweep Toronto', 'As if to add insult to injury, the Baltimore Orioles decided to further make their point by earning a series sweep against Toronto with last night\xe2\x80\x99s 6-1 victory. In doing so, they put the post season hopes of their division rival further and further from their grasp, which I suspect is much appreciated in cities like Kansas City and Oakland. Nevertheless in their first game since becoming champions of the east, the Birds found a way to win \xe2\x80\x93 even with a lineup that featured some reserves, including Christian Walker (who was called up from Norfolk to play first base in his big league debut).As we know, it all begins and ends with starting pitching. Bud Norris was better than his number indicate, however his pitch count prevented him from going deeper into the game. One thing that Toronto does well is take pitches, and a lot of Norris\xe2\x80\x99 offerings were fouled off last night. Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 5.1 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 5 BB, 4 K. Now those aren\xe2\x80\x99t horrible numbers, however Norris and Buck Showalter probably envisioned him going deeper into the game. The Orioles ended up using three relievers, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t horrible. And if there\xe2\x80\x99s ever a day where you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind using some extra relievers it\xe2\x80\x99s one immediately prior to an off day.The Orioles broke a scoreless tie in the last of the third when Steve Pearce sent a home run over the left field wall. Two innings later he would return for an encore performance with a three-run blast, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were off to a 4-0 lead. Toronto added one in the seventh when Jose Reyes grounded into a double-play which scored a runner from third base, however the Birds weren\xe2\x80\x99t in a mood to have someone come back on them \xe2\x80\x93 even in a quasi-meaningless game. Jimmy Parades grounded into a fielders choice which scored a run in the last of the inning, which gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 5-1 lead. Tack on a David Lough solo home run in the eighth, and the Birds crused to a 6-1 victory to sweep Toronto out of town.In that seventh inning, Christian Walker also notched a double for his first big league hit. I would submit that it\xe2\x80\x99s rare for a team in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 position to call up a player to make his big league debut. Most of the time a team does that at this point of the season they\xe2\x80\x99re well out of contention and just trying to see what they have in a player within the organization.Courtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Orioles have really ridden on the bat of Steve Pearce this week given that he hit a couple of homers against New York, along with a big one on Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s clinching game as well as last night. While Adam Jones is without a doubt the leader of the team, I would submit that Steve Pearce is one of the many unsung hero\xe2\x80\x99s this year for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. The story of Pearce choosing not to go to another team (that happened to be Toronto) because he was promised by the Orioles that they would bring him back is something that won\xe2\x80\x99t be forgotten for some time in these parts. Needless to say, I think that both parties have been rewarded for their loyalty.Today is an off day for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, the final scheduled day off of the regular season. Buck Showalter also announced before yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game that the team will have a full day off on Monday, September 29th, with workouts on Tuesday, September 30th and Wednesday, October 1st. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will begin post season play on Thursday, October 2nd.Showalter also reiterated that the Orioles are wary of being caught for the second seed in the playoffs by Detroit/Kansas City. While the O\xe2\x80\x99s certainly would love to have the #1 seed if they could overtake Anaheim, it appears that the priorities for the franchise going forward will be getting guys some rest and ensuring that they don\xe2\x80\x99t fall to the third seed.\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles Fever Spreading After O\\u2019s Clinch A.L.

The last time fans saw the Orioles clinch a division title was back in 1997. Now, 17 years later, they all say it\xe2\x80\x99s time to get pumped up for the playoffs. The magic from the night the Baltimore Orioles clinched the American League East championship continues Thursday as the team kicks off a series of citywide parties aptly named the \xe2\x80\x9cWe Won\xe2\x80\x99t Stop\xe2\x80\x9d pep rallies. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going all the way.

The Inner Harbor\xe2\x80\x99s Hard Rock Cafe hosted the first pep rally. Free t-shirts were a thank you gift to fans, the O\xe2\x80\x99s bird graced many pictures and former O\xe2\x80\x99s center fielder Al Bumbry inked items from fans. He says if the team keeps playing like champs, they\xe2\x80\x99re going far this year. \xe2\x80\x9cThey find a way to win, they\xe2\x80\x99re always in ball games. And if their starting pitching continues to do as well as it\xe2\x80\x99s done, I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine,\xe2\x80\x9d Bumbry said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been an Orioles fan my entire life.

At this point, the O's are three games behind the Angels for the best record in the league. Assuming, the O's do not leapfrog the Angels, they will face the winner of the AL Central, which remains a close race with the Tigers leading the Royals by 1.5 games.\xc2\xa0 Who should the Orioles root for in the final two weeks of the regular season to become their opponent in the ALDS? Rotation The Tigers have perhaps the most dominant rotation in all of baseball, with only the Nationals and the A's coming close in my mind. When Justin Verlander might be the odd man out of the rotation in the playoffs, you know that your rotation is in very good shape. That might indeed be the case, as the foursome of David Price, Max Scherzer, Anibal Sanchez and Rick Porcello have outpitched Verlander significantly this season, though Sanchez's injury has clouded the situation. On the other hand, the Royals' rotation is similar the O's in a lot of ways, consisting of roughly league-average starters at all spots. There is not much difference among Yordano Ventura, Jason Vargas and Danny Duffy, the likely starters for the second, third and fourth games of the ALDS if they can line up their rotation. The key difference between the O's and the Royals is that the Royals have a legitimate front-line starter in James Shields. Against the Tigers, the O's would face a lopsided pitching matchup in every game of the series. Against the Royals, Shields is the only opponent the O's would be worried about. Advantage Tigers. Bullpen The strength of the Royals' pitching staff lies in its bullpen. Their top relievers in terms of innings pitched, Wade Davis, Kelvin Herrera and Greg Holland, have an average ERA of 1.31 and an average FIP of 1.96. The bullpen collectively has an ERA of 3.39 that only ranks 12th in the league, but that is still miles ahead of the Tigers which ranks 27th in the league in terms of bullpen ERA with 4.23. The Tigers have struggled to find a consistent reliever all year, with Joe Nathan floundering in the closer role with a 5.10 ERA. The other top relievers in terms of innings pitched include Joba Chamberlain with a 3.64 ERA, Phil Coke with a 3.70 ERA and Al Alburquerque with a 2.53 ERA. Against the Tigers, there is a much higher chance of coming back from behind, and that is necessary given the rotation of the Tigers. Advantage Royals. Lineup The Tigers have the fourth best lineup in the league in terms of wRC+ at 112. This comes amid a down season from Miguel Cabrera Among the eight position players with the most PA (the ninth being Austin Jackson who has been traded for Price), only Nick Castellanos has a wRC+ lower than 100 at 98. Victor Martinez has been the third best hitter in baseball by wRC+ at 163, behind Mike Trout and Jose Abreu. Miguel Cabrera, even in a down season, ranks 12th in wRC+ at 146 among qualified hitters. JD Martinez has been an even better hitter than Cabrera this season with a wRC+ of 156. Meanwhile, the Royals rank 23rd in wRC+ at 92. Among the nine position players with the most PA, only Alex Gordon and Lorenzo Cain have wRC+ above the league average of 100. The Royals are a singles-hitting machine, having the second-most singles in the league behind only the Tigers. Unlike the Tigers which also possess plenty of power, the Royals have the lowest ISO in the league, coupled with the lowest walk rate and the lowest strikeout rate (I know, it's hard to imagine a team walking less the O's). Singles are just not that threatening, and the Tigers' power is much more worrying.    Advantage Tigers. Defense The Royals rank third in the league in UZR behind the O's and the Red Sox. They rank 7th in DRS (the O's rank second behind the Cardinals). Meanwhile, the Tigers rank 28th in UZR and 29th in DRS. This point doesn't need further elaboration. Advantage Royals.   Overall, the Royals seem like a very similar team to the O's. Both teams rely on their superior bullpen and defense to support their average-ish rotation. The O's have a better lineup, which is why they have won nine more games than the Royals. The Tigers have superior talent and the shinier names, but the Royals make up for their deficit by employing a dynamite bullpen and one the best defenses. Nevertheless, talent wins out majority of the time, and the pitching advantage the Tigers have over the O's would be especially difficult to overcome. I will be rooting hard for the Royals for the rest of the regular season, so the O's can have an easier road to the World Series.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsNow that the Baltimore Orioles have clinched the AL East, I thought I would take a few minutes before the final home series with the Red Sox begins to look back at predictions about the Orioles and the division from all the experts just before the beginning of the season.Here are the current records \xe2\x80\xa6Baltimore\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 92-60New York\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 78-74Toronto\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 77-75Tampa Bay\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 74-79Boston\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 66-87Most baseball writers at the end of March this year did not really give the Orioles much of a shot beyond maybe \xe2\x80\xa6 just maybe \xe2\x80\xa6 being a challenger. I wrote at the time that this was rather curious relative to the last several years, the powerful season of 2013 by Chris Davis and others, the historic team defense, and especially the free agent acquisitions from late in the offseason.But I suppose it is difficult for national writers to move away from being enthralled with the ever-present force of the Yankees, the aberration that was the 2013 Red Sox, and the pitching of Tampa Bay. But, in their world, Toronto is as easy to trash as the O\xe2\x80\x99s are.Looking back, I am proud to report that of all the \xe2\x80\x9cexperts\xe2\x80\x9d I put in my preseason article, I was the closest and most accurate. While on one hand I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised at that, it is really nothing too great to be so proud of \xe2\x80\xa6 for several reasons.I actually picked the Orioles to finish second behind the Rays who would win 95 games, with the Orioles winning 92. So, if the Birds finish the season 0-10, I will have been perfectly correct.Nobody making predictions could have foreseen the numbers of injuries that befell so many teams, including the Orioles, though Tampa Bay may have been hit by them the worst. While the Blue Jays turned out to be better than the improved basement team I predicted, I was correct about the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 age and suspect infield catching up to them and that the Red Sox simply had an experience in 2013 where a collection of players had a career year at the same time. I did not see them falling all of the way into the basement, but, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wear the shame of that with a smile.The writer who was closest to my predictions was Steve Melewski of MASN. Our forecasts were only a game or two different for all five teams, as he had the Orioles finishing second to the Rays with 91 wins.Richard Justice, a columnist for mlb.com put the standings in the following similar fashion: Favorite: Rays.\xc2\xa0 Challengers: Red Sox, Orioles.\xc2\xa0 Darkhorse: Yankees.\xc2\xa0 Never say never: Blue Jays.\xc2\xa0 The Yankees, a darkhorse?

The one time the righty has faced Boston this season was back on July 6 at Fenway Park. That day, he went 5.1 innings and allowed one run on four hits and two walks while striking out seven.    It seems as though he has to be a lock to make the postseason roster in some capacity. Will it be as a starter or reliever? With the rest of the rotation performing so well, he would seem to be the odd man out.

The rookie was part of the Dodgers-Red Sox mega-deal that went down in 2012. Entering the season, he was ranked as Boston\'s fourth-best prospect by Baseball America. Right now, MLB.com has him listed at number three behind Xander Bogaerts and Jackie Bradley Jr. The 24-year-old out of Greensboro, North Carolina features three pitches. His fastball has an average velocity of 91.9 mph, his silder averages 84 mph and his changeup is just below that at 83.5 mph.

The Birds would go onto defeat the Seattle Mariners in the ALDS, but lose to the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS. However most fans probably felt that the franchise was in a good place in terms of winning moving forward. The likes of Rafael Palmeiro, BJ Surhoff, Brady Anderson, Roberto Alomar, and of course the great Cal Ripken Jr. were all still in place moving forward. However one day after being named AL Manager of the Year, Davey Johnson resigned as the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 skipper, which began a series of events that would haunt the Orioles for years to come.Whether it was PED accusations, free agent money not spent, free agents who turned into busts, injuries, poor coaching decisions, or anything else, the O\xe2\x80\x99s flailed in the wind for a long time \xe2\x80\x93 too long for some. Owner Peter Angelos of course opened the purse strings for slugger Albert Belle, however he retired after two seasons due to injuries. However the Orioles kept him on the roster for three seasons so as to collect insurance on his contract, and at a certain point they became hesitant to go after free agents due to that experience. The likes of Palmeiro went away and returned, only to embarrass the franchise with a PED suspension (which to this day has never been explained from Palmeiro\xe2\x80\x99s side).Cal Ripken Jr. ended his consecutive games\xe2\x80\x99 streak in 1998, and he retired after the 2001 season. That\xe2\x80\x99s when it seemed the mass exodus of fans began, as there was no superstar or big name to pay to see. Subsequently you had the likes of Sidney Ponson being knighted in his native Aruba, and then arrested on several occasions (once in Baltimore). There were times that it seemed that the franchise could do nothing right, including normal personnel moves. The likes of Lee Mazzilli, Sam Perlozzo, and Dave Trembley came and went. Heck, Mazzilli had a first place team in June and July of 2005, only to be out of a job by the end of August. Tough times had fallen on the yard, and yet it seemed that the Warehouse was above the cries of pain from their most loyal of supporters.Perhaps the most poignant aspect of those days were the consistent takeovers of Oriole Park by NY and Boston fans. It often seemed that those two franchises\xe2\x80\x99 success was directly tied to nadir after nadir for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. When either of those franchises would come to town, their fans would come with them. There were stories of fans waiting anxiously by the phones for the specified day and time for Oriole tickets to go on sale so that they could buy up series\xe2\x80\x99 worth of tickets to see their team play on the road in Baltimore. Because ultimately a trip to Camden Yards complete with food, travel expenses, and game tickets had better value than seeing their team play at Yankee Stadium or Fenway Park. Go figure that.The \xe2\x80\x9cHouse that Jeter Built\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFenway South\xe2\x80\x9d shirts that were sold over time became staples at Oriole Park. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 team store on Eutaw St had to resort to selling Boston/NY caps and shirts so as to have the opportunity to make a buck during those series\xe2\x80\x99. In my view the absolute worst moment was in May of 2008 when Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Manny Ramirez hit his 500th career home run at Camden Yards on a Saturday night. The place went absolutely nuts, and to add insult to injury the giddy Ramirez was all too happy to take a curtain call \xe2\x80\x9cfor his fans\xe2\x80\x9d in a visiting ballpark.In 2007 however things began to change. Owner Peter Angelos hired Andy McPhail midway through the season, and as we all know he put into place a core that we see on the team today. His most celebrated move of course was the trade that sent Erik Bedard to Seattle in exchange for Adam Jones, Chris Tillman, and George Sherrill. However also keep in mind that he drafted the likes of Matt Wieters and Manny Machado, all while bringing in the likes of J.J. Hardy, Chris Davis, and others. McPhail would relieve manager Dave Trembley of his duties in June of 2010, and by August of that year there was a new sheriff in town: Buck Showalter.Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAnd we all know the story from there; the 2011 Orioles completed a somewhat disappointing season with the greatest closing act of all time, the upstart 2012 team returned to the playoffs for the first time in 14 years, and just the other night the 2014 Baltimore Orioles won the AL East title \xe2\x80\x93 by beating Toronto. So it\xe2\x80\x99s been a long and curvy road with many toils and snares to get to this point in time, and thus a long time coming for this city, these fans, and this franchise. However while the journey of the 2014 Orioles is far from over, the \xe2\x80\x9clong road home\xe2\x80\x9d has been traversed.And that journey came to an end in a sense with the celebration we saw on the field on Tuesday. And you really have to tip your cap to the O\xe2\x80\x99s with how they included the fans in the celebration. They were acutely aware of how much suffering had gone on here over so much time.

The last-minute decision involved a re-writing of the lineup and the insertion of rookie Christian Walker \xe2\x80\x93 who had made his major league debut in the previous two games.Chris Tillman had one of his patented rough first innings and allowed a two-run homer to David Ortiz. Adam Jones tied the game with the same feat in the bottom of the third.Walker led off the bottom of the fourth inning by lining a 1-2 pitch over the center-field wall for his first career home run. It would prove to be the winning run, as the Orioles would go on to defeat the Red Sox 7-2.Boston starter Rubby De La Rosa was clearly upset when the umpire failed to call out the following batter Ryan Flaherty on what was indeed a clear strike.

It was perfectly executed by Jonathan Schoop. What is encouraging about this \xe2\x80\x93 beyond the fact that it was the first time it was done this season \xe2\x80\x93 is that Schoop made it happen. Back in April, Schoop was clearly completely lost on any capacity to bunt.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 As the AL East-champion Baltimore Orioles move closer to the postseason, one question that must be answered in the next week or so is: What to do with rookie Kevin Gausman?Gausman left with a blister after throwing five innings Friday night in Baltimore\'s 5-3, 10-inning loss to the Boston Red Sox.The right-hander hasn\'t won a game in six starts since mid-August, which hasn\'t exactly enhanced his stature on a solid pitching staff.""Honesty, I don\'t know what my role would be,"" Gausman said. ""It\'s one of those things where I\'m going to pitch when they tell me to pitch. Whether I\'m in the bullpen or starting, either way it\'ll be fine and it will be awesome.""Gausman gave up two earned runs and seven hits in five innings, the most damaging blows successive home runs by David Ortiz and Yoenis Cespedes in the fourth""Obviously, I never like to give up back-to-back homers but those are two really good hitters,"" he said.Finally, a blister ended his night.""We originally thought that my nail was coming up,"" Gausman said, ""but then when we finally looked at it after the game, kind of found a blood blister under my nail.""Although the Orioles are still in the running for home-field advantage throughout the postseason, manager Buck Showalter rested several regulars, including Adam Jones, J.J. Hardy and Nick Markakis.The Red Sox, who reside at the opposite end of the AL East standings, long ago stopped playing meaningful games. But this one carried some significance for Ortiz, now in his 12th season with Boston.He hit a solo shot in the fourth inning and added a two-run drive in the 10th off Darren O\'Day (5-2), his sixth multihomer game of the season and 47th of his career.Ortiz now has 34 homers and 102 RBIs, the club-record eighth time he has had a 30/100 season \xe2\x80\x94 passing Ted Williams. At 38, Ortiz is the oldest major leaguer to go 30/100 since Frank Thomas did it at the same age in 2006.""I don\'t know if you can say enough positives or accolades about David Ortiz, not just about what he did tonight but what he\'s done over an incredible career,"" Boston manager John Farrell said. ""Considering how many RBIs and how many home runs he has contributed this year, who knows where we\'d be without him?""Ortiz also moved into a second-place tie with Jim Rice for 100-RBI seasons with Boston, one behind Williams, who had nine.""It\'s a big compliment to be mentioned with him. It\'s something I have done with a lot of consistency and hard work,"" Ortiz said. ""I have to come in and do my best every day regardless of how the team is playing.""This is one of those years in which the Red Sox are faring poorly, despite Ortiz\'s impressive numbers.""It\'s too bad that we have had the kind of season where we aren\'t in it,"" said Ortiz, who moved into a tie with Dave Winfield for 33rd on the career home run list with 465.In the race for best record in the AL, Baltimore fell three games behind the Los Angeles Angels, who faced Texas later Friday night.The most prominent starter in the lineup was Nelson Cruz, who had three hits, as did Alejandro De Aza.Junichi Tazawa (4-3) worked the ninth and Edward Mujica got three outs to secure his seventh save and end Boston\'s five-game losing streak against Baltimore.Down 3-1 in the seventh, the Orioles used a two-out double by De Aza, a pinch-hit triple by Delmon Young, and a throwing error by shortstop Xander Bogaerts to tie it.Young is 10 for 20 as a pinch hitter this season.TRAINER\'S ROOMRed Sox: It will take some time before INF Brock Holt (concussion) is ready to return. ""There are still some important steps he has to complete,"" Farrell said.Orioles: Markakis missed a second straight game with a sore shoulder. He was struck with a pitch on Tuesday.""It was not a glancing blow,"" manager Buck Showalter said before the game. ""Nicky\'s pretty sore today, but he\'s available.""UP NEXTWinless in his last six starts, Red Sox right-hander Rubby De La Rosa (4-7, 4.31 ERA) tries to break the cycle Saturday night against the Orioles, who will start Chris Tillman (12-5, 3.29), their likely choice to pitch Game 1 of the playoffs.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

If somehow the Orioles could win all seven, they would finish with identical 50-31 records at home and away. Why not be greedy?

That's probably because it didn't matter. Sunday afternoon, the first place O's lost to the last place Red Sox in a game that didn't matter. They still almost won, only losing 3-2. All that matters now is everyone being healthy for the postseason. Of course, they're all professionals and they always want to win, but it doesn't do much good if they hit the postseason and no one has anything left in the tank. Nick Markakis was out of the starting lineup for a fourth straight game with shoulder pain resulting from being hit by a pitch in the Toronto series. Steve Pearce sat for a second straight game with right wrist soreness that may have occurred when he tumbled into an awkward slide on Friday night. Adam Jones started out on the bench. These are luxuries you can take when you've got 93 wins and a division title already clinched even though there's seven games left to play. It wasn't much of a show for the 38,329 fans who came out for the regular season home finale, but even the fans know it's not the end. This is just the second time in Camden Yards history where the Orioles have finished their home schedule knowing the playoffs will still be coming to Baltimore. The Sunday crowd took the O's season total to 2,464,473, their highest draw since the 2005 season. That was over only 80 dates due to rain compressing two Pirates games into a single admission doubleheader.    As for the game itself, the word ennui comes to mind. I wouldn't say it was lazy, because there were not any plays by either team that seemed to be the result of laziness. But it wasn't full throttle either. It had the feel of spring training - lots of reserves, not much difference whether they won or lost. It was a different sort of meaningless game than we've gotten used to in September.    O's starter Miguel Gonzalez got the game underway by allowing a leadoff home run to Sox second baseman Mookie Betts, the first leadoff homer of his career. That was also the fifth leadoff home run that Gonzalez has allowed in 26 starts. That set the tone for the day. Gonzalez labored through that first inning, also allowing two men on base with singles before getting Rusney Castillo to ground out and end the inning. That set up the Sox with a 1-0 lead. They held on to the lead for the rest of the game. The Orioles offense did a whole lot of not much for the first five innings. The most exciting thing about those early innings was Delmon Young beating out an infield single in the first and then stealing second base. You should all be embarrassed for allowing that to happen, Boston. Sox catcher David Ross looked like someone ran over his dog after Young was called safe. After that, the O's went down 1-2-3 in three of the next four innings. Snooze button.    Another Red Sox run came across in the fifth inning courtesy of a Yoenis Cespedes single with two men on base. They added their third and final run with two outs in the sixth inning as Orioles manager Buck Showalter tried to get a six inning start out of Gonzalez. It didn't work; he gave up a home run to Ross on an 0-1 count and was lifted from the game, one out short of his seventh straight quality start. Over his 5.2 innings, Gonzalez gave up three runs on eight hits and two walks. He struck out seven but allowed two home runs. Not a great day, and certainly not the kind of day you'd want to see from him against a team in the playoffs. Victor Martinez and Miguel Cabrera loom. For the O's hitters, the sixth inning was the only scoring inning. Alejandro De Aza led off with a walk and scored from first on a double hit by #2 batter David Lough. A deep fly ball to center by Young moved up Lough to third, where he was able to score on a groundout by newly-minted Most Valuable Oriole Nelson Cruz, his 106th RBI for the season.    Two-out rallies in the eighth and ninth amounted to nothing. Young and Cruz had seeing eye singles in the eighth, but both were stranded when J.J. Hardy struck out. In the ninth, pinch hitter Steve Clevenger was left hanging by pinch hitter Kelly Johnson to end the game. You're not going to win many games where the other team gets twice as many hits as you. There were good moments, there were a couple of clutch hits, but mostly they got few chances and that's not going to cut it. Joe Kelly has been good for Boston - we may yet curse the Cardinals for being dumb enough to give up a breathing human being for John Lackey (4.50 ERA for STL). Maybe it was just the Orioles B-team in a game that didn't matter. Whatever the reason, they lost the home finale, and it doesn't much matter, because the postseason is coming to Camden Yards. Young had a good day in the losing effort, racking up two hits and one assist in the outfield. In the top of the seventh, Cespedes hit a line drive and brief-tenured Oriole Jemile Weeks kept running as if there were two outs. There was only one; Weeks was doubled up in embarrassing Casillan fashion. The Royals beat the Tigers on Sunday afternoon, keeping the Orioles seven games ahead of the Tigers for the #2 seed in the league with seven games to play. Any Orioles win or Tigers loss sews it up. They may yet face the Royals, who trail Detroit by 1.5 games.    Next up for the Orioles is a four game series against the Yankees in New York starting on Monday night.

The Orioles defeated the Red Sox 7-2.Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are able to set a new 25-man roster at the beginning of each of the rounds of the playoffs \xe2\x80\x93 for the American League divisional round (ALDS), the championship round (ALCS), and the World Series.Honestly, the bulk of names to be a part of the roster are not difficult to name easily. It only comes down to a final 2-3 names to complete the 25 slots beyond the obvious choices.A big question will be if Buck Showalter chooses to keep 11 or 12 pitchers, affecting the number of position players to be retained. For most of the season, the Orioles have carried 12 pitchers. But I am going to assume for purposes of this discussion that it will be 11 who are on the playoffs roster.These are shorter series, and I would think that Buck would want more matchup potential at the plate and on the bases to deal with what are likely to be very close games. But it would not be a giant surprise if the Orioles choose to carry 12 pitchers.Pitching (11)Starters (4) \xe2\x80\x93 There is only a need for four starters. The first two are quite obvious: Chris Tillman and Wei-Yin Chen. I would guess that the competitive Bud Norris would be third and will pick Miguel Gonzalez as fourth. This allows the upper 90s power arm of Kevin Gausman to come out of the bullpen, providing a specific option or length.Relievers (7) \xe2\x80\x93 There are five obvious choices who have been with the team all along: Closer Zach Britton, set-up men Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Andrew Miller, and match-up relievers Tommy Hunter and Brian Matusz. Add Gausman and left-handed T.J. McFarland for length. If Showalter chooses to go with 12 pitchers, look for Brad Brach to be the extra arm beyond the names listed.Position Players (14)Catchers \xe2\x80\x93 (2) \xe2\x80\x93 Caleb Joseph and Nick Hundley \xe2\x80\x93 the two-man catching rotation continues.Infielders \xe2\x80\x93 (6) \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Pearce\xc2\xa0and J.J.

Clearly Alejandro De Aza will be there, as will be the pinch-hitting guru Delmon Young. With anticipated close games, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will want to have some extra base-running speed, and I am calling for the playoffs-experienced Quentin Berry to be kept for this purpose. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterThis scenario leaves out David Lough, who has been with the team all season.

Lough and others can be kept active for possible changes in successive rounds.The question of Chris Davis joining the Baltimore Orioles for the World Series is one that, of course, needs the team to get that far. I would render the opinion that bringing him back cold at that point, after the difficulties and total picture of this season, would not be a good move. I suspect many would disagree with this view, probably including Showalter and Duquette. Some of this may be determined by how well Paredes and Johnson hit in the American League playoffs.

Buck Showalter said that both Steve Pearce and Nick Markakis would play this week in New York, which is a good sign.

Baserunning is one of these elements, and many people simply don\xe2\x80\x99t consider it. That\xe2\x80\x99s a shame, because it can really add up. Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me?

The players are Carlos Beltran and Paul Konerko, respectively, and the discrepancy comes as the result of one thing: baserunning. Since debuting in 1998, Beltran has been worth 64 runs on the bases, which only four players can top; on the flipside, Konerko has cost his clubs 69 runs on the basepaths, the lowest in the majors since 1997\xc2\xa0(his rookie year). With equal performances when they step up to bat, this duo only separates once the at-bat has ended.Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s move to more Oriole-centric news. The Baltimore Orioles, in case you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard, will make the postseason! The position players, who have churned out the third-most value in baseball, should receive most of the credit for that; the best player of the group happens to have his name featured in the title of this post. Yes, Adam Jones has posted another superb season for the Birds, just as he did last year. In fact, since the beginning of 2013, his 9.5 WAR ranks 10th in the American League. Most of that has come from his offense, as he has accrued 38.2 Offensive runs \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa013th in the AL. However, his hitting, while decent, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t supply as much as you might expect: By wRC+, he\xe2\x80\x99s only the 24th-best hitter in the league.If Jones doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mash, how does he have so many runs to his name? You guessed it: baserunning. By Ultimate Base Running (or UBR, on which I\xe2\x80\x99ll elaborate in a moment), he has been 9.2 runs above average for these past two years, a hair behind Austin Jackson for third in the AL. This represents a huge step forward for him, since he only had 12.7 of those runs to his name before 2013. As Birds Watcher\xe2\x80\x99s Domenic Vadala noted prior to the season, Jones\xe2\x80\x99s recently-aggressive approach on the bases has served the Orioles well.Does Jones derive that success from blazing speed? Hardly: His Spd \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0a number that measures, well, speed\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 over that time sits at 4.6. As a point of reference, league-average is 4.4. Unsurprisingly, no one else in the top 10 for UBR has a Spd below 5, which means Jones\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments are pretty impressive. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t steal bases, with a meager 1.6 wSB in 2013 and 2014. No, his improvement stems from a finer craft, of underappreciated dashes and darts, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time they received their due.Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at UBR. What goes into it? According to Mitchel Lichtman, its creator, it incorporates several factors, including (but not limited to):Taking an extra base on a hit by another batter (e.g., going from first to third on a single, scoring from first on a double, etc.);Taking an extra base on a fly ball;Advancing on a ground ball hit by another batter (e.g., going from second to third on a grounder to shortstop, etc.); andNot getting thrown or tagged out while doing the above.So how has Jones fared in these regards? The statistical oasis known as Baseball-Reference can give us some answers. It has a tidy number for the first part: Extra-Base Taken rate, or XBT%. In 2013 and 2014, the MLB averages for those stood at 39% and 40%, respectively; Jones topped those by a healthy margin, with 43% and 52% figures, respectively. That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t caused his change, though, as he\xe2\x80\x99s put up better numbers in the past: From 2006 to 2012, he had a 50% XBT%.Moreover, Jones doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to have made significantly safer decisions in his baserunning, since he still makes outs at about the same rate. In the first seven years of his career, he got Out On the Bases (OOB) 23 times in 3118 plate appearances, whereas years eight and nine have seen those numbers change to 9 and 1362, respectively. Both numbers sit below the major-league-average marks, but the latter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t diverge notably.Thus, Jones\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite UBR comes from the second and third aforementioned parts of his game. He frequently seeks to take extra bases\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 he has 20 Bases Taken (BT) in the current campaign, to accompany 21 from the prior one. By contrast, he only had 59 in every season before those; plus, those came in almost two-and-a-half times as many trips to the dish. Paired with his out-avoiding ability, his uptick in aggression has even more value: Among the 33 MLB players with 20 BTs in 2014, for instance, a mere 10 others have run into as few as three outs. This combination doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come along all that often.Annoyingly, B-R doesn\xe2\x80\x99t break down TB further, so this is where my analysis will have to end. Luckily, though, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 season won\xe2\x80\x99t end for a while, and Jones will most likely play a large role in keeping it alive. He might do that by smacking a home run (or two), or by preventing someone else from doing the same. Or, he could support the team in a more subtle manner. If you watch more closely, the breadth of Jones\xe2\x80\x99s excellence might surprise you.All statistics courtesy of Baseball-Reference.

The Orioles defeated the Yankees 5-4. Mandatory Credit: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles registered a 5-4 win over the New York Yankees on Tuesday evening that contained a number of positives that should make O\xe2\x80\x99s fans feel a little bit better in this odd final week of the regular season. It is a strange time of kinda competing, while kinda resting and getting oriented and prepared for the playoffs to begin in another week.The Orioles pounded out a total of 17 hits, including 14 singles. So that is 17x more hits than they pounded out Monday night. If they can keep up that trend of 17x more hits each night, it would be 289 on Wednesday night and 4913 on Thursday evening \xe2\x80\xa6 just sayin\xe2\x80\x99. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get this sort of analysis just anywhere!Even so, with 17 hits, one would expect a few more runs than simply five; but the hits were very spread out over the game. The Orioles had baserunners in every inning. Four of the Orioles had 13 of the 17 hits, with Nick Markakis getting four, while Nelson Cruz, Kelly Johnson, and Nick Hundley had three hits each. This was the fifth game this season where Markakis has gotten four hits; and since he has been struggling a bit lately, it is good to see him come alive again. \xc2\xa0Nelson Cruz leads the AL in home runs by 3 with a total of 40Cruz hit his 40th home run, which puts him three homers ahead of Houston\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Carter for the AL lead. Markakis and Johnson also hit home runs.Also regarding Cruz, it has been great to see the way that he has hit to all fields of late and beaten the shifts on numerous occasions. He still hits home runs while doing this \xe2\x80\x93 which is what Chris Davis is somehow going to need to learn to do if he wants to be a top drawer offensive threat again.Hundley has been hitting well, while Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s bat has gone into a deep sleep. Though I think Joseph is the player with a future in Baltimore, it may be that Hundley should play something like two-thirds of the games in the playoffs. Over his past 10 games, Hundley is 8-for-31 with two home runs, and over his past 20 games he is 19-for-64 (.297) with three homers.Ubaldo Jimenez got his second consecutive win, and he will apparently get to start the final game of the season in Toronto \xe2\x80\x93 where much of the bullpen will get some final tune-up time in the game. That Jimenez can finish the season on a positive and contributory note may well be very significant for his winter and for next year. The Orioles are going to need this guy to put it back together and make the investment worthwhile.It was great to see Zach Britton come on and get the Yankees in the bottom of the ninth inning. Though giving up a high-chopping infield single, he come right back to strike out Derek Jeter. Britton had some nasty stuff going on.

For what it is worth, I think Betances has the single best arm in all of baseball. He is a big guy (6\xe2\x80\x998\xe2\x80\x9d) with upper 90s fastballs and breaking stuff that varies in speeds greatly. He will likely be the Yankees closer for the next 12-14 years, and it is going to be a problem for everyone.But all in all, the Baltimore Orioles are working to get themselves set up for the playoffs run. Anything can happen and there are no guarantees. Winning is difficult and lots of stuff has to go well, but truly the O\xe2\x80\x99s have as good a chance as anyone.

It had to do with the man at the plate, Derek Jeter, who was batting with two outs in the ninth inning, the Yankees trailing by a run and a runner on first base.If the Yankees were going to earn a berth in the playoffs, this would have to be part of the improbable script.But Jeter struck out, flailing at an 0-2, two-seam fastball from Orioles closer Zach Britton, leaving the Yankees hanging on to their longshot playoff hopes by the slimmest possible margin.\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re thinking that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to hit a home run, or hit a ball in the gap and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to tie the score and see what happens,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, unfortunately, but you have a pretty good feeling when he\xe2\x80\x99s up there.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      With Brett Gardner on first base, Jeter made the final out and Baltimore won, 5-4.

Nothing changes. We must win tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles, who have already clinched the American League East title, powered their way to the win behind home runs from the former Yankee Kelly Johnson; Nick Markakis, who drove in three runs; and Nelson Cruz, who blasted his 40th homer of the season. All three homers came off Brandon McCarthy, the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 starter.The Yankees scraped their way back into the game, thanks in large part to Brian McCann\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer in the seventh, which narrowed the gap to one run. Jeter reached on an infield single with two outs in the inning and the Yankees trailing by 5-2, and he scored when McCann hit his 23rd homer of the season.

The Orioles added another run later in the inning on Markakis\xe2\x80\x99s run-scoring single. Markakis struck again in the fourth with a two-run homer, a line drive deep into the right-field bleachers for his 13th home run.The Yankees clawed back one of those runs in the bottom of the fourth. Chase Headley drew a one-out walk, and Mark Teixeira, back in the lineup after receiving a third cortisone shot in his sore right wrist, doubled. Headley then scored on a groundout by Chris Young.

Selig said he would do whatever he could to help Jeter in his quest to become a part owner of a team in the future.

Call it \xe2\x80\x9cthe script.\xe2\x80\x9dFor Derek Jeter to be a hero in his final game at Yankee Stadium, the Orioles would have to score three runs in the top of the ninth inning to tie the game. They did it.Then the Yankees would need to get a runner to second base with one out for Jeter to drive him in. They did it.Then Derek Jeter would have to get a hit to drive the runner in. He did it \xe2\x80\xa6 on the first pitch \xe2\x80\xa6 with his classic swing staying inside the pitch and driving it into right field.Evan Meek should have walked him!\xc2\xa0 Haha!\xc2\xa0 Imagine the stadium if that happened!The whole scenario made me think of this story \xe2\x80\xa6I was adopted by my grandparents when they were in their mid-40s. So after having raised three daughters, my father was in his mid-50s with a second family \xe2\x80\x93 a boy who was crazy about baseball. He had to learn to like a game for which he had no previous interest.Dad grew to have a genuine interest, but he also had a skeptical view that it was all scripted somewhere behind the scenes \xe2\x80\xa6 that the World Series would be stretched out to seven games most likely \xe2\x80\x93 just to sell more tickets and make more money.So, seeing the incredible script unfold to have Derek Jeter win the game in the bottom of the ninth \xe2\x80\xa6 well, it made me think of dad, and of what he would have said.Actually, Jeter had two previous RBIs in the game. It was his night. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll agree with Rick Dempsey who said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf there was ever a game I was OK with seeing the Orioles lose, it was this one and to Derek Jeter.\xe2\x80\x9dWhile the game was progressing, and pondering about whether to write something at all about Derek Jeter, I was looking back at the game logs of his history against the Orioles. I was looking to see if I could find a couple of incredible Jeter performances to write about and reflect upon. And I could not \xe2\x80\xa6 surprisingly. Unless I overlooked something, I think Jeter only ever had one four-hit game against the Orioles, and that was in 11 innings.But here is what was impressive while doing that research: Derek Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s consistency. And that is fitting, that is his heritage. Over and over, while looking at the Yankees / Orioles series, Jeter would register five, six, or seven hits per series.It was a wonderful career by one who will always be remembered properly as among the very best.Actually, the Orioles had four home runs and still lost the game. It was broken defense that lost the contest more than anything. Amazingly, Dave Robertson became the winning pitcher after giving up three runs in the ninth inning on the home runs by Adam Jones and Steve Pearce.This game \xe2\x80\x93 the drama of it, and the storybook finish \xe2\x80\x93 like the final day of 2011 is another reason why I continue to love this sport as the best of them all.

On offense at least, it was a classic 2014 Orioles game: Nick Markakis and Alejandro de Aza opened the game with back-to-back jacks off of Hiroki Kuroda, putting the Orioles in the driver's seat early. Then the bats went ice cold: after de Aza singled in the third, no one reached base until Nick Markakis walked in the top of the 9th. Then Adam Jones smacked a two-run shot over the wall in left, Nelson Cruz struck out, and Steve Pearce followed with a dinger of his own. These are your 2014 Orioles. That would've been enough to win the game, on paper at least. But the Orioles' defense, and to some extent the pitching, just wasn't up to the task. Kevin Gausman needed 35 pitches to get out of the first inning. The only solid hit he gave up was a double to, you guessed it, Derek Jeter. But since Brett Gardner had just singled, that double was enough to make the score 2-1. Then Jeter moved to third on a wild pitch in the dirt. He scored when Brian McCann reached first on an error by Kelly Johnson, who bobbled an easy grounder. That tied it at 2, and there the score remained until the wild seventh inning. T.J. McFarland struck out Stephen Drew but the ball bounced away from Caleb Joseph and Drew reached first easily. Ichiro Suzuki tried hard several times to bunt the runner over, but failed ... and ended up walking. Jose Pirela, called up just a few days ago, did bunt -- and got a perfect one down, making Joseph dive for it so his throw nearly escaped the reach of Steve Pearce.    Bases loaded, nobody out, tie game. Brett Gardner chopped a grounder to Pearce at first base. Pearce was running in and was able to scoop the ball up and fire home for the force-out. One down. Up next was ... yeah you guessed it, Jeter. The Yankee Stadium crowd was on its feet, chanting, hoping for a hit, a walk, something, anything. Buck Showalter brought in Ryan Webb to relieve.    What the fans got was an odd duck of a play. On an 0-1 pitch, Jeter swung hard at a sinker well inside, breaking the bat. I like to think that he was aiming at Jimmy Paredes, who'd shown a slight case of the yips in his throws to first bast earlier in the game. But the ball squibbed out towards J.J. Hardy at shortstop. He gathered it and tossed it to Johnson at second base to start the double play. Only it was a bad throw and Gardner had been off on contact and was sliding in hard. Johnson missed the ball and it rolled into right field, where Markakis was alertly backing up the play. Two runs scored, and Gardner ended up on third. He'd score one batter later on a sacrifice fly. Suddenly it was 5-2. The Captain had done it again with a ... broken-bat RBI and error by the Orioles normally sure-handed shortstop? Sure, why not. Let's give Jeter this one -- he out-clutched Hardy and, with his calm eyes and steady gaze, willed that ball into right field. Yes.    If that had been the game, fine. But it got even zanier than that. The score stayed at 5-2 until the top of the 9th. Joe Girardi brought in ace closer David Robertson, who may also have been in his final Yankee stadium game, given a) he's a free agent next year and b) what transpired while he was on the mound. Oh wait, I already told you. Walk, dinger, strikeout, dinger. Tie game at 5. It was such an Orioles comeback, to blast two home runs after being dominated by Kuroda all game. But you know why the Orioles tied the game, right? It was so that The Captain could have his final moment underneath the bright Bronx lights. And have it he did. In the bottom of the ninth, Buck brought in Evan Meek to keep the game where it was -- or to give his old protege a chance at superstardom, I can't be sure which. He also brought in Ryan Flaherty to play third base. Both moves would haunt him, or make him happy he could provide Jeter a scripted walk-off moment: whichever it is, I don't know. Anyway, Jose Pirela singled to start off the inning. The ball scooted underneath the glove of a diving (or rather, falling) Flaherty. Somebody named Antoan Richardson came in to pinch run. Gardner was up next, and he sacrificed RIchardson to second base. So now here we are (again): tie game, runner in scoring position, and Captain Clutch at the plate.    As I recollect, it was a hanging curveball. Floated right over the plate. You or I probably could have made solid contact with it. Jeter put all of his signature inside-out, opposite-field stroke into it. The ball shot into right-center field, Richardson raced around the bases to score, and that was it. Career (at Yankee Stadium, anyway) complete, legacy secure: Jeter had gone the opposite way for a walkoff RBI. And the scriptwriter got up from his chair, stretched his tense back muscles, yawned and rubbed his eyes sleepily, and let an easy grin tug at the corners of his mouth. He'd done a good night's work on this, his final masterpiece. I would like to do one last thing, and that is give Steve Pearce credit for some solid D tonight. At times he seemed like the only one paying attention out there. The 5'11, stocky first baseman had to jump and snare more than a few poor throws from other infielders. Those catches made sure the score wasn't absurd, as there were runners on base when he was doing his glovework. Tomorrow, the Orioles end the regular season with a three-game set at Toronto.

With their mediocre record, it was almost impossible. But they felt that if any team could generate such an improbable run, it would be a team with him on it.Not even Jeter in his farewell season, though, could manufacture that much good fortune, and for the second straight year the Yankees failed to make the postseason. The outcome, long in coming, became official Wednesday when the Baltimore Orioles beat the Yankees, 9-5, at Yankee Stadium in front of an announced crowd of 46,056, which seemed to care more about each Jeter sighting than the final result.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all disappointed,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should be disappointed. We\xe2\x80\x99re sorry for the organization and all the fans because they\xe2\x80\x99ve come to expect us to be in the playoffs, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not this year.\xe2\x80\x9dThe last time the Yankees failed to make the playoffs in consecutive years was 1992 and 1993, the final years of a 12-season playoff drought. In 1994, the Yankees were in first place in the American League East when the season was ended by a strike, which lasted into 1995. That was the year Jeter joined the Yankees, and in 17 of his 20 seasons the Yankees advanced to the postseason, winning the World Series five times. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The loss also ensured that Joe Girardi would become the first Yankee manager since Buck Showalter in 1993 to fail to make the postseason in consecutive years. Showalter now manages the Orioles, who clinched the A.L. East last week and are one of the hottest teams in the major leagues.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Girardi also failed to make the playoffs in 2008, but he won the World Series in 2009.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing; it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work that goes into the course of the year for everyone involved, and this is not where you want to be this time of year. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so frustrating.\xe2\x80\x9dAt the time of their elimination, the Yankees had 81 wins with only four games to play. The Kansas City Royals and the Oakland Athletics both started the day with 86 wins, so there was no way the Yankees could catch either team for a wild-card spot.The main reason for their poor season was a lack of offense, which at times was compounded by substandard defense. The Yankees, who spent lavishly on free agents like Carlos Beltran, Brian McCann and Jacoby Ellsbury, entered Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game having scored 606 runs, which ranked 13th in the 15-team A.L. Players including Jeter, Mark Teixeira, Beltran and McCann did not play up to their standards.

McCann leads the Yankees with 23 homers, but the first half of his season was dismal. Teixeira acknowledged that the second half of his season was \xe2\x80\x9cterrible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Jeter has struggled, too. He had a .324 on-base percentage in the first half of the season, but it dropped below .275 in the second half. At 40, he has shown a lack of range at shortstop. His overall on-base percentage of .301 is well below his career mark of .377 and well below the mark for a typical No. 2 hitter.

At times we struggled in other areas defensively. Pitching was pretty consistent. We went through a lot of injuries and had to use our bullpen a lot, and at times I think there was some fatigue there. It\xe2\x80\x99s everything involved.\xe2\x80\x9dJeter went 0 for 4 on Wednesday, breaking his seven-game hitting streak. After his final out, a weak tap to first base on a checked swing, he walked back to the dugout with his head down as the fans stood and cheered. They kept clapping, shouting and chanting his name in the hope that he would emerge from the dugout and make a curtain call. But Jeter explained later that it would have been awkward to do that while the Yankees were still trying to win a game that mattered.Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s game will not matter, except as a stage for Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s goodbye to New York. Weather permitting, he will play his last game in the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 home pinstripes, and it should be an emotional affair. But it will also be the only home game he has ever played when his team has already been eliminated from postseason contention. He played in one so-called meaningless game, on the road, in 2008.

A season of ups and downs and historic moments, the Orioles have made the playoffs, played against future Hall of Famer Derek Jeter in his final game of his career, and most importantly suffer the loss of former Orioles executive, the late Frank Cashen. And as Baltimore clinches the AL East early, a big advantage they needed, let\xe2\x80\x99s look back at the man who arguably defined the Baltimore Orioles.Frank Cashen came into the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lives in 1965 as executive vice president of the team. A native of Baltimore, Cashen played second base at Loyola College before joining the Baltimore News-American where he spent 17 years as an award winning sportswriter. Cashen was a leading candidate for American League presidency and to replace then Commissioner Bowie Kuhn in 1975. Shocker, a sportswriter with a great mind for baseball also has a great mind for beer.Frank was seen as a shrewd business man. Many trade proposals came from his brillance. While in Baltimore, Frank Cashen orchestrated perhaps the greatest trade in the history of baseball when he acquired Hall of Fame hitter Frank Robinson in 1966. Truly a \xe2\x80\x9cHow the hell did he pull that off?\xe2\x80\x9d move, Robinson would go on to win the Triple Crown, three American League pennants from 1969 to 1971, and the 1970 World Series.After Harry Dalton left for the Los Angeles Angels, Cashen took over as General Manager for the rest of his tenure in Baltimore. He would eventually be led away by the New York Mets, but his impact helping shape the Orioles franchise still resonates in fans today. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels5/3 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet5/1 - Baltimore Orioles: The key piece in making the six-man bullpen work4/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Inconsistent pitching leads to unexpected roster moves4/29 - Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck ShowalterSadly, the baseball world was shocked to learn Frank Cashen passed away June 30 at the age of 88.A man of integrity and passion with a penchant for bow ties, no one had a more diverse career than Frank Cashen. His greatest successes and most unsettling disappointments came from building a juggernaut of the Baltimore Orioles in the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s. I was tickled to learn Frank commonly said the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cAnother day in paradise,\xe2\x80\x9d a phrase I say at least once a day to a coworker.Orioles fans know exactly just how difficult it is to be a fan. Having not seen a World Series title since 1983 and a horrible string of seasons in the 90\xe2\x80\x99s, a Baltimore Orioles fan can sometimes be a life of heartache. The Baltimore Orioles are good this year. Really good. AL East champs and poised to make a deep playoff run, the Baltimore Orioles are in prime position to pay tribute to Frank Cashen. Who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love a great feel-good story? Let\xe2\x80\x99s win one for Frank, Baltimore.

Just don't let anyone get hurt. It was explosive the last time these two teams got together. Baltimore has just three games to get through before they start playoff baseball. Namaste. Pitchers RHP Drew Hutchison. Toronto 2014 stats: 10-13, 4.51 ERA, 179.2 IP, 168 H, 23 HR, 59 BB, 176 SO, .246 BAA, 1.26 WHIPLast start (@ NY Yankees): 4.0 IP, 5 H, 2 ER, 3 BB, 6 SO, LCareer against Baltimore: 7 G, 3-1, 2.15 ERA, 46.0 IP, 11 H, 4 HR, 47 SO, 10 BB Hutchison has a history of superb starts against the O's, but that was broken his last time out when he allowed six earned runs over 6.1 innings to be handed his only loss ever against his AL East foe. However, he did still manage to strikeout 11 Baltimore batters. Missing bats is something that Toronto's right hander does very well. Right now, he averages 8.8 strikeouts per nine innings pitched in 2014. I would expect that number to inch just a bit closer to nine after tonight.    On top of that, Hutchison does a better job of pitching at Rogers Centre rather than away for it. His ERA at home is 4.11 compared to 4.80 on the road.    RHP Chris Tillman, Baltimore 2014 stats: 13-5, 3.26 ERA, 201.1 IP, 178 H, 21 HR, 66 BB, 145 SO, .232 BAA, 1.21 WHIPLast start (vs. Boston): 7.0 IP, 5 H, 2 ER, 2 BB, 6 SO, WCareer against Toronto: 13 G, 4-5. 3.98 ERA, 83.2 IP, 77 H, 16 HR, 61 SO, 20 BB He is your starter for game one of the ALDS and for good reason. His ERA is a measly 2.55 in September and he has regained his ability to strike opponents out recently. In his last five starts he has thrown 29.2 innings and struck out 29 batters.    But Tilly doesn't do so well in Toronto. He is 2-3 in seven starts there with a 5.79 ERA over 42.0 innings pitched. The worst part is that he has given up 13 home runs in those innings. So, this may not be the best last impression we get from the righty. Good thing he will be pitching at Camden Yards next week. However... MASN's Roch Kubatko brought this tidbit to his readers attention\xc2\xa0earlier today in a blog post. As long as Tillman doesn't lose tonight, he will have the most road starts in a single season without a loss since 1914. It will tie him with Greg Maddux. Both men will have made 15 starts. Tillman is 8-0 on the road this year, Maddux went 13-0.

Notes  Tillman has allowed 3 ER or fewer in 20 straight starts. It is the second longest streak in Orioles history. The club leader is Dave McNally with 25 such starts back in 1968. Tillman has already gotten to 200 innings pitched for the second consecutive season. MASN's own Jim Palmer has the Oriole record of 11 200 inning seasons in the black and orange.

"", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles lose 4-2 to Blue Jays in another meaningless game ...', ' Tonight\'s game between the Orioles and Blue Jays was probably the least interested I\'ve been in a game all season. The only possible thing that the Orioles still had to play for was the teeniest, tiniest chance that they might get the top seed in the playoffs, something also dependent upon the Angels getting swept this weekend, which just isn\'t going to happen. Scrub lineup was in full effect, and it showed in the 4-2 loss. Chris Tillman started the game for the O\'s, his final tuneup before game one of the ALDS in six days. He wasn\'t at the top of his game, it\'s fair to say, but he was also let down quite a bit by his defense, which looked a touch Bad News Bears-y at times. The four runs he gave up marked the first time he\'d allowed four earned runs since June 5th, a span of 20 starts. Not bad, Chris, not bad. I\'m gonna give you a pass tonight based on that excellent track record. And hey, good job not walking anyone. The Orioles scored one run in the first inning and one run in the fifth inning, and managed just six hits and one walk against 12 strikeouts. David Lough, who desperately wants to make the playoff roster, had two hits, a stole base, scored one run and knocked in the other. While tonight\'s game was an entirely different sort of meaningless game than the many that I\'ve recapped for this site throughout the years, it still reminded me of when I spent the time to write about loss after loss after loss. I\'m so thankful to the Orioles that they finally allowed me to start writing about meaningful baseball. I went back and started reading my old recaps. Those were strange times, friends. Here are just a few for you to read this evening to remind you how good we have it these days.    2009 was a bad, bad, bad year. We had some good times on this site, for sure. But there were dark days as well. The Orioles did not deserve me. Also, I had a lot of hate in my heart.    September 28, 2009 - Rays 7, Orioles 6: They want me to hate them.  You know how sometimes a person is in a relationship, and they want break up, but they\'re too lazy or non-confrontational to just do it, so they passive aggressively start acting like a jerk so that the other person will go ahead and break up with them and they don\'t have to deal with it? This is what the Baltimore Orioles are doing to me. I\'ve said it before and I\'ll say it again: the Orioles are my abusive boyfriend.     September 22, 2009 -\xc2\xa0Orioles 5, Blue Jays 6 (11) - F this team Entire recap:       September 1, 2009 -\xc2\xa0Yankees 9, Orioles 6 (in which I actually apologize for being mean and short with people because the Orioles are making me miserable)  Tonight was yet another frustrating loss. My head says, ""Who cares"" but I can\'t help it. Watching the losses, listening to that pro-Yankee crowd, seeing another season end with a whimper, it\'s tough. It makes my stomach hurt. We keep banking on the future, but what if it never comes? What if there is 12 more years of this? Do I stop liking baseball? Because I can\'t keep it up, and I can\'t root for another team.     That was a rough month, for sure. And the start of 2010 was even worse. But then: August 1, 2010 -\xc2\xa0Royals 5, Orioles 4: Tuesday is the first day of the rest of our lives  The Orioles just lost three out of four to the Kansas City Royals, despite every effort by the Royals to throw these games away. A fitting end to the Trembley/Samuel managerial tenure, if you ask me. Tomorrow is an off day, and Tuesday begins the Buck Showalter Era of Orioles baseball. Time will tell exactly what that means, but I say bring it.  You know what? They brought it. So let\'s enjoy these last two meaningless games this weekend and then watch our O\'s kick some butt in the playoffs.

put it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeter, who was uncharacteristically expressive after the game.It was a night when everything seemed to happen specifically to allow Jeter to be Jeter in front of his home fans for the last time. The rain stopped, the Orioles pushed the game to the bottom of the ninth by hitting two home runs, a Yankees runner got to second base, and Jeter came to the plate again with his name ringing in his ears. He then did exactly the kind of thing that had made him so adored by his fans.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees were leading, 5-2, heading into the ninth inning, but Adam Jones hit a two-run homer off Robertson, and Steve Pearce hit a bases-empty shot to tie the score. Jeter was at shortstop at the time, and he slumped his head momentarily. But on the bench, his teammates looked at the scoreboard and saw who was batting third in the bottom of the inning.

09/27/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles fall in Toronto - Birds Watcher', 'In his final road start of the regular season, Chris Tillman fell for the first time \xe2\x80\x93 on the road, that is. In fairness, the Buck Showalter also trotted out the B-lineup for the occasion. Adam Jones, Nelson Cruz, Steve Pearce, and J.J. Hardy were all on the bench. And Orioles fans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really have a problem with that at this stage. It gives guys rest before things get reved up again next week. It\xe2\x80\x99s also Showalter playing the numbers; Jones was 3-for-26 against Toronto starter Drew Hutchinson lifetime.Chris Tillman probably pitched well enough to win, but it was far from his best outing. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 11 H, 4 R, 0 BB, 5 K. Eleven hits is a lot, but also keep in mind that save for the four runs he also managed to strand many of those runners or get them out. I suspect that the Baltimore Orioles looked at this as more of a tuneup game than anything else, comparable to the final spring training start before camp breaks and the team heads north.Courtesy of John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY SportsDavid Lough got on base in the first inning and promptly stole second, giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s an immediate threat in scoring position. Lough would score on Delmon Young\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double, and the Orioles had an early 1-0 lead. Things got sloppy for the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the last of the second, as Munenori Kawasaki\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single tied the game. However Toronto loaded the bases on several well-placed and misplayed infield singles. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 defense has been off for most of September. However we should also keep in mind that for much of the past two weeks we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen different people in different positions due to the O\xe2\x80\x99s resting people after clinching.Pompey stroked an RBI-double and Kawasaki an infield RBI-single (which was misplayed on a Steve Clevenger error at first base) in the last of the third to give Toronto a 3-1 lead. While Clevenger\xe2\x80\x99s error didn\xe2\x80\x99t help matters, we should keep in mind that the play was ruled an RBI. Furthermore, Clevenger won\xe2\x80\x99t be playing first base in the ALDS and beyond.The Orioles got one back in the fifth when Jonathan Schoop scored on David Lough;\xe2\x80\x99s groundout. However previous to that the Orioles fell victim to the Rogers Centre turf, as Alejandro De Aza hit a shot on which Schoop probably would have scored. The ball bounced high off the artificial grass and landed in the stands for a ground rule double (forcing Schoop to stop at third). It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say how the game would have turned out had that not happened, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just how the ball bounces.Pompey hit his second triple of the game in the last of the fifth, which drove in Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s fourth and final run of the night. On a positive note, the Orioles bullpen returned to it\xe2\x80\x99s solid form, pitching three innings of scoreless relief between Ryan Webb, Andrew Miller, and Joe Saunders. Of those three, I suspect that Miller will be the only one on the post season roster, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of baseball to be played between now and then.By virtue of the loss, the Orioles have officially been eliminated in the race for the AL\xe2\x80\x99s best record \xe2\x80\x93 which goes to Anaheim. So today\xe2\x80\x99s and tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s games are officially meaningless for the Baltimore Orioles in that they can\xe2\x80\x99t move up or down in any standings. Go figure that a franchise that all but invented meaningless games in August and September for the better part of a generation would find itself in that same situation in games 161 and 162 this year. But the Orioles are okay with that now, as they\xe2\x80\x99ll be onto bigger and better things after tomorrow afternoon.One thing that is worth watching is the AL Central race between Detroit and Kansas City.  Congratulations to the Kansas City Royals on making the post season for the first time since 1985. Orioles fans know how Kansas City fans are feeling this morning, and they deserve to see their team in the post season after all this time.  Detroit currently leads by one, however both teams have two to play. Whomever wins the division will play the Orioles in game one of the ALDS at Camden Yards on Thursday.Speaking of game 161, it wil be played this afternoon just after 4 PM. Wei-Yin Chen will get the start for the Orioles, in one final tuneup before the playoffs. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s J.A. Happ. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles call up Alexi Casilla, designate Preston Guilmet ...', "" If there's one thing this Orioles team was missing as they coast towards the end of the regular season, openly not really caring if they win games, it was leadoff hitter Alexi Casilla. That's what is happening on Saturday. Casilla hasn't even been on the roster all season, so they've added him with only two games to play and sent Preston Guilmet packing. It's kind of a harsh fate to get sent to the great DFA in the sky in September, when rosters have already expanded, but hey, Guilmet would still get a World Series ring, probably. Over ten games for the O's across several different stints, he pitched in 10.1 innings and had a 5.23 ERA, with 12 strikeouts and only two walks, but he also gave up two homers. Thanks for everything, Preston. No, really. Why Casilla? Well, if you've been watching these meaningless games, you've noticed that the Orioles defense in the infield, particularly at third base, is not cutting it lately. Jimmy Paredes has had his problems, enough that the Orioles seem to be giving a little audition to a guy who batted .214/.268/.295 in 62 games for them last season. Also, Casilla has a total of 31 major league innings at the third base position. It's not that hard. Tell him, Wash. Technically, a player has to be on the 40-man roster by September 1 to appear in the postseason. There are loopholes to this rule. We know how Dan Duquette loves finding his loopholes. The answer lies in replacing players who spent time on the roster who've since gone on the disabled list, such as Manny Machado, whose knee injury resulted in this whole third base mess in the first place.    Casilla has been slumming in Norfolk this season, where he played in 56 games - none of which were at third base. He'd been in Sarasota staying sharp with several other players just in case they needed him. Turns out they needed him. I can't think of Casilla without recalling what's probably the most boneheaded baserunning play I've ever seen, when he ended a game in Baltimore last season by getting doubled off first base on a routine fly ball where he just kept on running and never stopped. Now we get a chance to see more of that - perhaps even in the playoffs. It's a joyous occasion, except for the fact that it's not. Perhaps it's desperation on the part of the Orioles. Perhaps it's some kind of overwrought misdirection meant to confuse Tigers/Royals scouts. Either way, he's leading off and playing third base on Saturday.

This has, after all, been his worst full season, statistically.But there he was, acting as if it was 1996, hitting an opposite-field, game-winning single in the bottom of the ninth against the Baltimore Orioles to punctuate his 20 seasons in pinstripes.The clear parallel is to Ted Williams\xe2\x80\x99s final at-bat, on Sept. 28, 1960, at Fenway Park, in his final home plate appearance, wrapping up with a scintillating coda.      {""url"":""https:\\/\\/json8.nytimes.com\\/slideshow\\/2014\\/09\\/26\\/sports\\/baseball\\/one-last-celebration.html"",""headline"":""One Last

  Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s single added to his lore but did not advance the Yankees to the postseason.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But the hit set off a wave of exultation at Yankee Stadium, where Jeter allowed himself to bathe in the cheers of the 48,613 fans, who were primed all season to attend the finale. He was hugged by his jubilant teammates as if he had won the World Series. He visited his shortstop position after the game, crouching briefly in a prayer of thanks. He spoke expressively afterward, as he never had, to the news media.The game was seen by more viewers, an average of 1.25 million, than any other in the YES Network\xe2\x80\x99s history.Jeter will do, in the end, what Williams would not. Rather than end his career at home with a memorable hit, Jeter will accompany his team to Fenway, where they will play a season-ending series against the Red Sox. But he will not play shortstop again, reasoning that the last view of the position he wanted was the one at Yankee Stadium. Instead, he will be a designated hitter, a choice Williams did not have.A Yankee icon is giving Red Sox fans the last word on his last game.

ending to his New York baseball career, when his signature hit \xe2\x80\x94 opposite-field single, first pitch \xe2\x80\x94 beat the Baltimore Orioles, 6-5, in the bottom of the ninth inning. He raised his arms in triumph, smiled widely, embraced teammates past and present. And then he went for a walk. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The point of baseball is to go home. Jeter, who understands the game as well as anyone ever has, did just that. He went to his home, shortstop, the position he played his entire career, never straying for even an inning to another spot.

This was it.

He said a prayer.\xe2\x80\x9cI basically just said thank you, because this is all I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever wanted to do, and not too many people get an opportunity to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said later. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was above and beyond anything that I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever dreamt of. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what to say. I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived a dream since I was 4 or 5 years old, and part of that dream is over now.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story       Continue reading the main story               More

Mandatory Credit: Peter Llewellyn-USA TODAY SportsWatching the baseball flying past Baltimore Orioles infielders while opponent runners circle the basepaths is not something that O\xe2\x80\x99s fans are accustomed to seeing. And the question that is raised is if this is something to be greatly concerned about as the playoffs season approaches.The problem of course is that it is difficult to replace a Platinum Glove winner in Manny Machado, a Gold Glover in Matt Wieters, and a top-tiered defensive first baseman in Chris Davis.The issue is especially obvious at third base, where there have been six errors in the past nine games. As well, there are other plays that are not being made that, while not counting as an error, are balls that Machado may well have turned into an out or prevented from going down the line into the left-field corner for extra bases.Over the past 12 games, the Orioles have committed a total of 13 errors. In those games, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have a record of 6-6. A total of 11 errors were committed in the six losses, while only two errors were recorded in the six wins.Defense is not everything, but a breakdown with it tends to multiply by becoming the seed that leads to more weeds growing. The other team is given more outs and Orioles pitchers need to throw more balls \xe2\x80\x93 diminishing their effectiveness and shortening their length in the game.Here is a breakdown of the 13 errors over the past dozen games:Ryan Flaherty \xe2\x80\x93 two throwing errorsKelly Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 twoJimmy Paredes \xe2\x80\x93 twoAlexi Casilla, Christian Walker, Brad Brach, J.J. Hardy, Caleb Joseph, Nick Hundley, Steve Clevenger \xe2\x80\x93 one eachThe throwing errors by Flaherty are the biggest concern on the list, since he will likely be the most featured player at third base. And while not a big Flare-dog fan, I think this is out of character and that he is a plus defender.J.J. Hardy will be solid, we know that.It has seemed that Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s level of play has gone down, and not just with his at-bats. But overall, the catching has been quite solid.Beyond this, the names on the list are mostly the end-of-season players who will either not be on the roster for the playoffs or featured much on the field.Since the clinching of the AL East title on September 16th, there has not been much in the way of a regular-looking Baltimore Orioles lineup. When the O\xe2\x80\x99s take the field on October 2nd, I think we can expect their generally stellar defense to be with them. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('The Importance of a Good Closer - Birds Watcher', 'Mandatory Credit: Peter Llewellyn-USA TODAY SportsThroughout the 60 years of Orioles baseball, Baltimore knows the importance of a good closer. From Stu Miller and Tippy Martinez to Gregg Olson and, most recently, Jim Johnson, the Orioles have had an abundance of solid closers. Now in the 60th year of the ball club\xe2\x80\x99s existence, Zach Britton can be added to that list.Last year, Britton played in eight games (seven games as a starter) and posted a 4.95 ERA with only 18 strikeouts to his name. With control issues at the age of 25, people were wondering in the off season whether Britton would find a role on the 2014 Orioles team.Showalter made the decision to move Britton to the bullpen to begin the year. Once there he thrived as one of the more consistent middle relievers on the team. However, because of inconsistency from Tommy Hunter early in the season, Britton tried his hand at closer. Luckily for both Britton and the Orioles, it was a match made in Heaven.Now at the end of the season, Britton is fourth in the American League for most saves with 37. He has only blown four save opportunities on the year with two of them being because of errors made by the infielders.The left-hander has a 1.65 ERA on the season with opponents batting a measly .178 when facing him. Also, his strikeouts went up from 18 last season to 62 this year.Just four days away from Game 1 of the ALDS, Britton will be faced with the challenge of shutting down the Tigers. He will also be expected to perform well with thoughts of his wife in his head as they are expecting their first child within the next week or so.Britton has had some great outings on the mound in the ninth inning this year, but none would be sweeter than striking out Miguel Cabrera in Game 3 of the series to complete the sweep of Detroit and advance to the ALCS.
