04/03/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles 2016 season preview - Birds Watcher', 'A season preview for the 2016 Baltimore Orioles, led by Buck Showalter.So here we are, finally one day prior to Opening Day for Buck Showalter and\xc2\xa0the Baltimore Orioles. Tomorrow the O\xe2\x80\x99s will take on Minnesota at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, and the games will truly count. No more fake baseball, no more scrutinizing over statistics that mean nothing \xe2\x80\x93 they all count from here on out!Courtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsSo what can fans expect from the 2016 O\xe2\x80\x99s? If you listen to certain groups and certain national pundits, they\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that this team has no chance. And for all we know, perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s true. Returning the home run king from two of the past three seasons (Chris Davis) with a new long-term contract can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly mean that this team has a shot at doing anything, right? The same might be true of returning one of their most effective relievers over the past few seasons in\xc2\xa0Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day. No shot, right?My point isn\xe2\x80\x99t that this team is going to reach the stars in 2016. It\xe2\x80\x99s that you can\xe2\x80\x99t count them out as some people have done. The big question mark of course is starting pitching. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters were \xe2\x80\x9chammered\xe2\x80\x9d last year, however they weren\xe2\x80\x99t as sharp as we would have expected either. That needs to change in 2016 if this team is going to contend.And the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some turnover in the starting rotation indicates that the staff is going to need to be on point this year.\xc2\xa0Miguel Gonzalez, a fan favorite, is now gone \xe2\x80\x93 and\xc2\xa0Mike Wright, a young guy who had a great sprin, is in. The Orioles will also benefit from the addition of\xc2\xa0Yovani Gallardo\xc2\xa0to the staff. And they hope that once he returns,\xc2\xa0Kevin Gausman\xc2\xa0will return to form as well.The bullpen was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 big strength the past few seasons, and with the return of O\xe2\x80\x99Day there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to assume that won\xe2\x80\x99t continue to be the case. He and\xc2\xa0Zach Britton anchor the back end of a bullpen that was as sure as anything in the game the past two years. With an unsure starting rotation, the importance of the \xe2\x80\x98pen is greater than ever.Offensively of course, the O\xe2\x80\x99s can flat out mash. The return of Davis was both unexpected (by some), and welcome. And the normal cast of characters around him will be the same \xe2\x80\x93 along with the likes of Wieters (who also returned, on a qualifying offer), Jones, Machado, Hardy, and Schoop, 2-16 shapes up to be a great year at the plate for the Orioles. More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal2/17 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Johnson wants to revitalize his careerThe O\xe2\x80\x99s also added\xc2\xa0Pedro Alvarez, formerly of Pittsburgh, very soon after the beginning of spring training. Once he got going, Alvarez had a decent spring and will nicely compliment the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense (which was already in good shape). And one of camp\xe2\x80\x99s biggest surprises was Rule 5 pick\xc2\xa0Joey\xc2\xa0Rickard, who dazzled the coaching staff with everything he did. The guy gets on base left and right however he is able, and quite frankly my vote would be for him to be the team\xe2\x80\x99s semi-regular lead off hitter.However the biggest advantage this team has over it\xe2\x80\x99s competition continues to be in the dugout. Buck Showalter is the master at knowing which buttons to push and when, along with managing the game several hitters (or in some cases innings) down the line. Needless to say, he\xe2\x80\x99s the best manager in the American League East. And that comes as a big advantage for the Orioles and their fans.So I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s prediction time. Lots of people and lots of other media outlets have asked me to give a prediction in terms of wins and losses for this team \xe2\x80\x93 some even before spring training began! And I\xe2\x80\x99ve always kicked the can down the road a bit. So now, one day before the start of the regular season, it\xe2\x80\x99s put up or shut up time.People love to say that the AL East isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good division anymore. Maybe it is, maybe it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. The competition is going to be fierce this season, needless to say. There\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance that four or five teams might enter September with a shot at making the playoffs in the AL East. So needless to say they\xe2\x80\x99ll beat up on each other, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance that the division winner might not even make it to 90 wins.So my prediction for the Orioles in 2016 is to finish at 86-76. Mind you that last season the Orioles finished squarely at .500, and that included a few stretches in which they could barely muster base hits in games. Heck, they were no-hit in Seattle. So if they can minimize that (perhaps by having a guy in Rickard who gets on base a lot), they should be good for a few extra wins year-over-year.It obviously remains to be seen whether or not 86 wins is enough to win the division or qualify for the post-season. But needless to say, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be competitive until the end. The Orioles will hold a team workout at Camden Yards this afternoon, and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll prepare for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Day festivities when Minnesota comes to town for a 3 PM first pitch.\xc2\xa0With all of that said, it\xe2\x80\x99s truly an honor to be back serving Orioles fans and the people of Baltimore for another season of Orioles baseball. On behalf of the staff here at Birds Watcher and the FanSided Network, I so very much appreciate the loyal fans that we have who read this site on a daily basis.

Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have announced the retention of Hyun Soo Kim after days of drama and attempts to get him to agree to additional time of adjustments at Norfolk.The move sends spring season standout Xavier Avery to AAA instead, while also retaining Nolan Reimold. Apart from some of the varied issues we will discuss here today, the move is consistent with historic Orioles functioning \xe2\x80\x94 doing all that can be done to retain every player on a bubble. This was the only way to keep all three, at least for now.One has to wonder what MLB Opening Day for Kim is going to look like and feel like. Though all fans hope for him (along with all other O\xe2\x80\x99s players) to have a great season, there is reason for skepticism about the Korean lefty, both at the plate and in the field.The question is if he is either being petulant in his insistence to enforce the contract or if he is genuinely clueless that he is not ready. The latter view puts him in a better light than the former possibility. In either event, this is an illustration of how a player-friendly contract that yields all of the leverage to the player is potentially harmful to the organization (all of the way down to the fanbase).And this again brings to speculation as to what Opening Day is going to hold. What will the greeting in the stadium be like when his name is called and he chugs down the orange carpet? It is not going to sound like that for fellow newcomer Joey Rickard. And what will this do for Kim\xe2\x80\x99s psyche? If a part of his refusal is related to some culturally-oriented aversion to \xe2\x80\x9cshame\xe2\x80\x9d about minor league demotion, what will a mildly hostile environment do to him? I don\xe2\x80\x99t see this fellow as a sort of Korean version of, say, Donald Trump in terms of resilience. But maybe $7 million helps anyone buck up to whatever public difficulty is at hand, I truly do not know of that personally.The Orioles fanbase has reacted to this in varied ways. The majority see Kim as foolishly stubborn, though some also blame the front office for creating the situation. Others are frustrated that Avery is not immediately available as a valuable lefty bat and defender, feeling he has suffered an injustice. A few also repeat the viewpoint that Reimold is not worthy of more chances and that he\xe2\x80\x99ll break down again somehow (when does the statute of limitations expire on that?).While believing that Kim has the ability to be successful and be what the O\xe2\x80\x99s hoped for in signing him originally, I have to say that I fall out mostly with the first view above: that he is being foolishly stubborn in not receiving wise American MLB baseball evaluation. All of the conversation that he just wants to play and help the team win falls short of the truth if he is not able to do that very thing on April 4th against the Minnesota Twins. And culture aside, it is not impressive that a professional athlete (an outfielder, not a DH) shows up more than just a bit overweight.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('2016 Orioles minor league previews - Camden Chat', ' Minor League baseball is an amoeba of sports entertainment. At different times, it can be mind-numbingly boring and ridiculously entertaining. A few of the men (boys in some cases) on the field have millions of dollars, many more can barely afford to keep a roof over their head. To get people into the seats, the minor league teams, usually located in small cities and towns, try to top one another by hosting absurd, headline-grabbing promotional nights. It really is something to behold.    While most of our attention will be aimed on Baltimore, don\'t forget that the Orioles have five minor league affiliates within reasonable driving distance of Charm City. If you could go for some baseball but want to save a little money on tickets, get a glimpse at some O\'s of the future and get stuck in a brutal post-game traffic jam on a one-lane country road, minor league baseball is your idea of a good summer night in 2016.

After a few suggestions, they narrowed it down to five choices: Berkely, Seamore, Skipper, Sonar and Triton. I\'m not sure why, but I feel like Seamore would have been hilarious. Instead, they went with Triton. The little seahorse guy carries around a trident all time so Triton makes sense. Sure.     By an overwhelming majority, TRITON has been voted as our new seahorse name!

We know that potential impact players Christian Walker and Trey Mancini are likely to see a lot of time in Virginia along with familiar names like T.J. McFarland, Henry Urrutia, L.J. Hoes and a bunch of others. If you want to see the near future of Birdland, this is the place to stop by.    Bowie Baysox -These guys won a championship last year While the Orioles slogged through an 81-81 season in 2015, the Baysox took home the Eastern League championship. This did happen with the help of some guys (Mancini, Mychal Givens) who will likely not be there in 2016, but a lot of those players on the championship team will return for more.

They may be in their late-20\'s or early-30\'s. They won\'t make a difference, but could fill a bench role or make a spot start for the O\'s if they need it. Down at the A level, we don\'t even know if the guys are up to being professional athletes yet. But the Orioles like to make sure that their best and brightest compete at Bowie.    Look at Manny Machado. He didn\'t even play an inning in Norfolk. But he spent 109 games with the Baysox. Mychal Givens is another one who skipped right to Baltimore from Bowie. Remember Nick Markakis? Never played triple-A baseball. Caleb Joseph spent 428 games with the Baysox. He is a team legend. He only went to Norfolk for 44 games. Now, things seem to be different when it comes to starting pitching. A lot of those guys stop at Norfolk, but do the Orioles even know what they are doing when it comes to starters? Probably not. So, I will ignore that fact because it does not help my point.

Let\'s go with that.    -There could be some serious young star power Catcher Jonah Heim (#14 O\'s prospect according to MLB.com) should be the everyday backstop. He is young for the level and has struggled with the bat. Last year\'s two top picks, D.J. Stewart (#7) and Ryan Mountcastle (#8) may spend a lot of time here. Stewart was bad with Aberdeen, but he will probably get a promotion anyway. Mountcastle did well at the lower levels and is due for a challenge. Hard-throwing southpaw Tanner Scott (#11) ended last summer with the Shorebirds but wasn\'t especially great. He should start the year with them and (hopefully) dominate the opposition this time around. Aberdeen IronBirds -The Iron Man If you didn\'t know, Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr. is pretty important to the works over at Leidos Field at Ripken Stadium. He pretty much runs the show and will make appearances at a handful of games throughout the season. He will even stay and sign autographs following the game. -See the young Birds first Aberdeen\'s season doesn\'t kick-off until late June. It\'s pretty much set up so that if the O\'s select a college player in the draft that month, he can jump right into the action with the IronBirds. Last year it was a disappointment with the way Stewart played, but usually those guys dominate at this level. So, that\'s fun.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
04/04/2016,"[('The magic of Orioles baseball on the radio - Camden Chat', ' I was alone, annoyed, walking to the train station. It was Game 2 of the 2014 ALDS, and after watching Wei-Yin Chen get lit up for Tiger home runs for several brief minutes, I had pretty much lost hope for that game. But I had made plans already to see my aunt and uncle, and so I couldn\'t watch anymore. I plugged in my headphones for the 25 minute walk to the train station, bummed.    I grew up listening to Orioles games on the radio. We didn\'t have HTS, and so Jon Miller and Fred Manfra really were the basis for the beginning of my Orioles fandom. Still, televisions everywhere later in life had spoiled me. It was the playoffs, damn it, and I wanted to watch the Orioles - not listen to them like I had for most of my life. I was forgetting, though, that probably the most powerful Orioles moment I\'ve ever had had come from the radio. The 2014 ALDS, as I would see a few minutes later, was only one of several. *** I\'ll never forget the look on my dad\'s face as we sat, eating dinner, briefly interrupting watching Game 1 of the 1996 ALCS. He wasn\'t a sports fan, really, at all, but my 10 year old self was into it, and so my family was nice enough to keep the old radio on during dinner, a rare treat.    It was a few bites through salad that Jon Miller\'s voice elevated.    ""Tarasco back...and a fan takes the ball away from him!"" We rushed downstairs to watch the argument, Davey Johnson losing his mind, Jeter horribly circling the bases, the Yankee Stadium crowd going mad. The key moment, however, had happened on the radio. Hearing Miller\'s voice allowed us to react to the moment in a way that we wouldn\'t had experienced by watching it. It allowed us to live it with someone else, not just in the prisons of our own beaten baseball minds. And it\'s always better, or more emotional, at least, if you live it with someone else.    I\'ve seen that Jeffrey Maier play over and over again now, seen Tarasco pointing upward. But I\'ll always experience it through my dad\'s expression, and through me rushing downstairs to see what exactly had happened on the television. 1996, really, was the beginning of my Orioles fandom, in some ways. That season I started keeping the radio on late, ear pressed firmly to the holes on the speakers, volume low as could be\xc2\xa0so my parents wouldn\'t know I had it on. I heard that season through my straining ears, and I\'ll never forget hearing the Orioles play the Blue Jays, winning late on a sacrifice fly to cap a wild 11-10 victory, then hearing a WTOP breaking news interruption that TWA Flight 800 had crashed into the ocean. It will always stick with me - a truly scary and shellshocked moment for the tired, stayed-up-way-too-late 10 year old that I was. I wasn\'t quite old enough in 1997 to stay up late to watch games, so I heard the conclusion of ALCS Game 4 while sitting upright in my bed, not bothering to keep the volume on low at that point. When I heard Sandy Alomar single in the winning run to give the Indians the victory and a 3-1 series lead, I was introduced to true despondent Orioles fandom for the first time. It was the first time I remember thinking that they had gotten this far, and it didn\'t look like they were going to get any further, and that I didn\'t know when I would experience playoff baseball or sports success this deep again. It was the beginning of being the jaded sports fan that all of us - except maybe fans from Boston in recent years - become at some point.    And I remember listening with radio on very, very low as Edgar Renteria singled in the winning run in the World Series that year, hoping that one day I could silently dance around my room, radio still on low, as the Orioles won it all and I could celebrate in secret, not letting my parents know that I was awake at\xc2\xa0midnight\xc2\xa0on a school night. *** The radio came and went from 1998-2013. I went to school, moved away from the DC area, remained a fan after the Nationals came. I mostly listened to games on the radio since I couldn\'t watch them out of market. It was mostly a sad state. But I should have appreciated it a bit more when I put in my headphones and was able to walk down the street, listening to the eighth inning of Game 2 in 2014. I should have known that this was something that was deeply bringing me back to my childhood. The hope built slowly. Once Steve Pearce singled in Adam Jones to make it a three run game, I somehow believed a little bit. I had some time before myt rain left, and so I walked to a nearby bar to see if I could see any TVs from outside, but to no avail. But it was OK. It was right for me to listen to that game on the radio, now far away from my childhood bedroom, but still having the same experiences and feelings I had as a 10 year old. It was 6-4, and the Tigers made a pitching change. I had five minutes until my train. I walked into the bathroom. Delmon Young came up.    ""Line drive down the left field line!"" I remember, Joe Angel making the call. I stared at the bathroom walls, not moving, almost not believing what was coming into my ears. I honestly don\'t remember the entire call. I just remember it playing out in my head, a thousand thoughts a moment coming through, somehow my young self willing on the runners who existed only for myself, not on some pixelated screen in front of me. And then the final call, about JJ Hardy. ""Safe!"" I got on the train, and it began to whisk me away to New York. Of course, I was still listening, but everything was perfect from that point on. Zach Britton came on, and he got the three outs, but after that hit that felt like a foregone conclusion. It was a cathartic party for all of us O\'s fans. I\'ll always treasure, though, that the greatest Orioles moment of the past 18 years, for sure, was a private moment for me. And through a stroke of fate, it was connected to my beginnings as an Orioles fan. I\'ll be listening to the radio this season. I\'ll jump up and down in my house when Chris Davis hits a no-doubter, and I\'ll be on the edge of my seat as the rotation tries to muddle through. I\'ll watch games when I get the chance. But for me, and probably for a lot of us, baseball started on the radio, and it remains there in a very powerful sort of way. If the Orioles ever win it all in my lifetime, you can bet I\'ll get a recording of the final out, and I\'ll be 10 again, silent in my bedroom, dancing around quietly at night.

The first real Orioles lineup of the year has been posted for the world. It\'s about time.    If you\'ve been following along with spring training lineups, you probably won\'t be surprised by this one. The starting nine lines up like so: 1. Manny Machado - 3B2. Adam Jones - CF3. Chris Davis - 1B4. Mark Trumbo - RF5. Matt Wieters - C6. Pedro Alvarez - DH7. J.J. Hardy - SS8. Jonathan Schoop - 2B9. Joey Rickard - LF SP - Chris Tillman - RHP Although Rickard had been leading off in a lot of spring games, it would have really been a surprise to me if he was leading off in game one of the season. If Rickard is able to play well, he\'ll likely move up to the top of the order due to his speed. Until then, it fits with Buck Showalter\'s track record that Rickard is at the ninth spot in the order. Buck likes to ease young guys in.    If it was left up to me, I\'d flip Jones and Davis, though Davis batting second is pretty weird. Still, Davis gets on base a lot and Jones doesn\'t. Jones is not a table setter kind of player. I\'d probably flip Hardy and Schoop as well, because we all saw how Hardy batted last year. Just look at that bunch, though. My gosh, this could be glorious. There will be many home runs. Look at all of that power. I wear around thick pessimist armor to keep me from getting hurt by getting my hopes up, but when I look at this lineup and realize this will look a whole lot like the every day lineup I find myself thinking dangerous thoughts like, ""What if they can do this dang thing?""

04/05/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles Opener: What Pitching Problems?', 'Apr 4, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Chris Tillman (30) pitches during the first inning against the Minnesota Twins at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsOn the opening day of the season, the Baltimore Orioles flipped the narrative that they have all power but no effective pitching.At the end of a long day featuring two rain delays, the O\xe2\x80\x99s prevailed over the Twins with a walk-off win in the bottom of the ninth inning on a Matt Wieters single.Yes, it is only one game, but the Baltimore Orioles did not display any significant pitching difficulties. Starter Chris Tillman did indeed look the best he has ever looked. Any of you reading this who were maybe stuck at work and did not see his two innings before the rain delay, but have heard multiple sources use the grandiose \xe2\x80\x9cbest ever\xe2\x80\x9d terminology, it is in fact completely true. His velocity was high \xe2\x80\x94 in the mid 90s. There was some late fastball movement, though that is not his game. But the velocity consistently on the corners can have the same effect. And Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s breaking stuff was crisp and tight. Striking out five of six batters, it was totally nasty stuff.Tyler Wilson was solid in his three innings. He\xe2\x80\x99s a true pitcher and can handle a jam without cracking. Of 39 pitches in three scoreless innings, 27 were strikes.The bullpen was typically effective, with the one criticism being that Mychal Givens was brought out for a second inning, thereby giving up the two Twins runs. Though he will need to be called upon for multiple innings during the season, it was probably not Buck\xe2\x80\x99s best call to bring him back on a damp opening day \xe2\x80\xa6 with an open day on the schedule following.All totaled, the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers gave up just seven hits and NO walks. Gotta love that, also striking out 10.On the other side, the Orioles also struck out 10 times. However, they picked up five walks along with their 10 base hits, including four singles by Mark Trumbo. He hits the ball so hard that he just drives grounders through the infield.The narrative about the 2016 Birds is that they are going to live and die by the home run. Well, they are still looking for the first of the season. However, in summer weather, three balls would have gone out of the park: an early fly by J.J. Hardy, the two-RBI double by Adam Jones, and a Chris Davis blast to the wall in straightaway center field. There will be home runs.Whereas 10 hits and five walks would seem to portend more than merely three runs scored, the Orioles actually were 4-for-11 with runners in scoring position. That\xe2\x80\x99s a keeper RISP average.Yesterday we wrote about batting orders, noting how Showalter put Rickard at the bottom to launch his new career. That turns out to be brilliant, also illustrating the \xe2\x80\x9csecond leadoff hitter\xe2\x80\x9d strategy of a high OBP player in the ninth hole. Rickard led off the fifth inning with a double, went to third on a Manny Machado single, and both scored on the Jones double to right-center..theiaPostSlider_nav._lower{display:none !important}Related Story: Orioles Batting Order ThoughtsSo the Orioles are unbeaten on the season. But so too are the Jays, having beaten the Rays for the second time in two days. But it pays to remember there is a ways to go.The win is the sixth consecutive opening day victory for the Orioles, and they have won 13 of past 16.

Buck Showalter indicated a similar sentiment after the game in his press conference. But that\xe2\x80\x99s life in baseball. It\xe2\x80\x99s the price these guys pay for playing the best sport in the world, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the price I pay for covering it!While I understand the need for it and so forth, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always disliked the token day off after Opening Day. It\xe2\x80\x99s only one day, but it\xe2\x80\x99s always felt like an eternity to me! So with that said, what do we know so far about this Orioles team? The answer is not too much \xe2\x80\x93 yet. The good news I suppose is that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had to make a roster move as of yet. Last year you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall Chris Davis was suspended for the first game in Tampa and was activated as soon as the game had ended.While we still don\xe2\x80\x99t know much, yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game should offer just a ray of hope to the crew who says that this team is doomed. Mind you, they still very well may or may not be doomed \xe2\x80\x93 we just don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet. However we were all under the impression that the 2016 O\xe2\x80\x99s would be a homer-happy group who in effect struggle to get on base and who\xe2\x80\x99s starting pitching would have it\xe2\x80\x99s struggles. Speaking for myself personally, I predicted a 7-5 victory for the Birds before the game yesterday.

Granted, for all we know Tillman would have totally fallen apart in the third inning onward had the game not been delayed. But all we can analyze is what we saw \xe2\x80\x93 and in facing six hitters Tillman struck out five. That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty impressive.Furthermore the O\xe2\x80\x99s won this game without hitting a home run. Adam Jones came close, and perhaps if it was mid-June instead of a dreary April day he would have. But while the run production wasn\xe2\x80\x99t great (three runs), the point is that they came without the use of a homer. On the flip side, obviously the bullpen surrendered the lead late in the game \xe2\x80\x93 something we aren\xe2\x80\x99t used to seeing. But again you can\xe2\x80\x99t totally knock them, as this was a long day overall that at a certain point probably got some guys off-kilter.Courtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsSpeaking of which, my biggest takeaway on this game was the fact that this is still a very resilient bunch of guys. There\xe2\x80\x99s no team who\xe2\x80\x99s psyche wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be affected by two long rain delays, poor conditions, and the low of having to wait around for so long after such a wonderful Opening Day ceremony.

Two outs were recorded in that ninth inning when guys swung for the fences. Admittedly, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably human nature when you\xe2\x80\x99re in that situation to end the game with one swing. But it ended up being a base hit and a walk that made the difference. Get guys on base, and good things will happen.And incidentally, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lesson in that final sequence of the game. Chris Davis was at first base when Mark Trumbo came to bat. Minnesota went into a \xe2\x80\x9cno doubles defense,\xe2\x80\x9d which in effect pushes the outfielders all the way to the wall. It\xe2\x80\x99s similar to a \xe2\x80\x9cprevent defense\xe2\x80\x9d in the NFL \xe2\x80\x93 which as we know effectively \xe2\x80\x9cprevents you from winning.\xe2\x80\x9d Now I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be overly critical of Minnesota for playing that type of defense, because in baseball it\xe2\x80\x99s probably the right play (on a double, a guy might be able to score from first base). However it certainly came across as playing it safe.And believe me folks, nobody plays it safe as much as I do \xe2\x80\x93 in all aspects of life. However in playing it safe, Minnesota was defenseless on a single up the middle. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what Trumbo hit; the center fielder had to run all the way back in to field the ball, allowing Davis to go to third. Granted he still would have been in scoring position, but you get the point.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsNew Baltimore Orioles starter Yovani Gallardo will make his debut tonight against the Minnesota Twins in the second game of the season.Gallardo represents a great measure of hope for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to bolster the rotation and provide some innings-eating consistency. His historic record would argue that he will be able to do this. Gallardo\xe2\x80\x99s past seven seasons have seen him throw between a low of 180 innings to a high of 207.His lowest ERA of those years was in 2015 with a 3.42 in Texas. However, at the same time, last year saw his highest WHIP number at 1.416.\xc2\xa0 Those two stats do not logically go together very well. But Gallardo induces a high number of ground balls, thus limiting the damage. And he has also been highly effective at pitching with runners on base and stranding them there.Those are skills he is going to need in Baltimore, especially keeping the ball on the ground. This defense can help him in that regard.In that Gallardo pitched in Milwaukee prior to his 2015 season in Texas, he does not have many extensive records against Twins hitters. However, Joe Maurer is 5-for-11 and Brian Dozier is 5-for-10 with a home run. Trevor Plouffe is 3-for-7 with two homers.On the other side, Kyle Gibson starts for Minnesota. Their most consistent pitcher in 2015, Gibson will seek to build on a season where he had a 3.82 ERA in 32 starts. Gibson started twice against the Orioles last year with a win and a no-decision. Both games he gave up but two earned runs.J.J. Hardy and Mark Trumbo are both 1-for-5 with a home run against the Twins\xe2\x80\x99 starter. Adam Jones is 1-for-8, Manny Machado 2-for-6, and Chris Davis 0-for-5. Ryan Flaherty has been 2-for-4, so could we see him in the starting lineup? Buck likes to break the ice with his players early in the year. But at the same time, Jonathan Schoop is 2-for-4. Pero Alvarez has never faced Gibson, so maybe Flaherty could be the DH today.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles improved to 2-0 on the young season with a 4-2 win over the Minnesota Twins Wednesday night, once again being bolstered by a strong pitching performance.It was a \xe2\x80\x9cbend without breaking\xe2\x80\x9d sort of evening for Yovani Gallardo and four O\xe2\x80\x99s relievers. The Twins had runners on base throughout the game, as the Birds were only able to record a pair of 1-2-3 innings: in the fourth by Gallardo and in the eighth by Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day.In the end the Twins only managed a total of five base hits including a home run by Trevor Plouffe and a pair of doubles by Byrun Buxton. But unlike the opening day game, Orioles pitchers surrendered a total of six walks. Even with the baserunners, the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers were able to keep all but two from crossing the plate.This game was one of those tedious affairs with a lot of deep counts and foul balls. It took a total of 3:11 to complete in front of less than 13 thousand fans.The average number of pitches thrown over a full season by an American League team in 2015 was 23,492. The Orioles were just above that number at 23,576. Doing the math, the average number of pitches thrown by a team in a game was 145.In the eight innings that the Twins pitchers threw against the Orioles, they tossed 153 pitches. And the O\xe2\x80\x99s five hurlers combined for a total of 175. Lots of deep counts with a total of six walks by each side. The Orioles struck out 13 Twins, while only fanning six times themselves.On one hand it is a more frustrating game to watch when there are so many pitches being thrown, yet at the same time, it is good that O\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers are hanging around the corners and effectively keeping the opposition from hitting many balls very hard.Hitting a ball hard and over the fence for the first O\xe2\x80\x99s homer of the season was Chris Davis, putting a ball about 15 feet beyond the near-miss drive to the center field wall from Monday night. But better even than the solo home run was the great defensive play by Crush. He saved an errant throw from J.J. Hardy and has looked like a 20-year-old at first base with his nimble movements. There are more ways to be of benefit than just hitting the ball 425 feet.

It may not be always pretty, but if Gallardo can be effective like this over the course of the season, the Orioles are going to enjoy some frequent successes and wins when he pitches.But the best element of the first two games, along with only four runs being allowed in 18 innings, is the improved plate discipline by Orioles hitters. Though they have struck out 16 times in 16.2 innings of offense, they have also walked on 11 occasions. If this could be a trend for the whole season, the O\xe2\x80\x99s might really defy the deadly predictions of the \xe2\x80\x9cexperts\xe2\x80\x9d in the baseball world.Ubaldo Jimenez will seek to keep the good pitching streak alive at 7:05 this evening, weather permitting. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('In his first Orioles start, Yovani Gallardo showed what ...', ' The undefeated Orioles already have two more wins against the Twins than they did in all of 2015 (0-7 vs. Minnesota), and in a few ways, the O\'s have been equally predictable as they have unpredictable.    In the first two games of the opening series, the Orioles already have 11 walks, a pleasant surprise for a team known for its lack of restraint. As such, the Orioles are an early silver-medalist in team on-base percentage (.380). In Monday\'s home opener, Chris Tillman appeared to be reincarnated as The Crow, though we won\'t know until Friday if his first start was merely him dodging a fatal fireworks accident or if he will in fact succumb to the Lee family curse. And as expected, Joey Rickard has signed on to play Superman in the next unwatchable Zack Snyder movie, an easy decision for Warner Brothers after a 4-for-7 start at the plate. Yay for small sample sizes! Where the Orioles have seen their fair share of early eye-openers, Yovani Gallardo\'s club debut went about as well as any realistic Baltimore person could have expected. It wasn\'t bad, nor good. Inflating, nor deflating. Gallardo was simply...solid.    Much was made to do with Gallardo\'s declining velocity and inability to go deep into games, and in his Baltimore coronation, Gallardo followed suit. Allowing only one run to go with two hits, three walks and four strikeouts, the 30 year-old Mexican righty exited the game with a two-run lead after five innings.    In a classic FIP-defying start, Gallardo sweated through the slight majority of the ballgame, and it\'s likely this is going to be the kind of pitcher we see throughout his Orioles tenure. For better or worse, I\'m sure you want to know why. Again, a statement of fact, Gallardo is no longer the pitcher he used to be. A pitcher that has seen his K% slowly evaporate from 23.7%, 18.6%, 17.9%, to 15.3% over the past four years, he\'s learned to be creatively cautious.       Yovani Gallardo First Orioles Start     Pitch Type Average Velo (Max) Count   Four-Seam Fastball 89.3 (90.0) 10   Two-Seam Fastball 89.1 (89.9) 13   Changeup 87.2 (89.0) 12   Slider 86.4 (89.0) 43   Curveball 78.2 (82.8) 11    Without much disparity in velocity, Gallardo forced himself to mix and match his entire array of pitches in order to fight through five long innings. I\'d imagine PITCHf/x was unable to decipher a few sliders from other offerings, say, a cutter, but that doesn\'t take away his reliance on his favorite pitch. As unpredictable as he was with repertoire, Gallardo was just as savvy in his placement.             Granted, Gallardo lived dangerously on occasion by missing Wieters\' glove up in the zone with his slider, but I\'m inclined to believe he pitches around the hands of hitters for effect. By using the slider at a higher frequency, especially towards the top of the zone, the fastball becomes an illusion, more so with two strikes. Gallardo\'s slider breaks more vertically downwards than horizontally, and as a hitter down in the count, you expect to see a pitch breaking to your knees, not rising above your hands.              <picture class=""c-picture"" data-cid=""site/picture_element-1494277440_505_6705"" data-cdata=\'{""picture"":true,""dynamic_picture"":false,""convert_picture"":false}\'>            <img srcset=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38flee_ak6d5Hte9Rwl0f3YA9Po=/0x0:718x404/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUI3pj9pCZhKRO1cLdoZL2CpEys=/0x0:718x404/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eEi0tK-8a7wTeRvSqTIHfEIbMuY=/0x0:718x404/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qy8VKEAaIfbaRhyuGtOq_FgP56k=/0x0:718x404/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 920w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dogVS4tFRvMLuLp2h19wcLvEKNY=/0x0:718x404/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 1120w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yt5qiE2LFP1oWvML4N0-QfsUFpQ=/0x0:718x404/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 1320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2HAaI-JP-B91Rwg_VOWrMyDlcno=/0x0:718x404/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 1520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j5m7JZxrezJ-yuwBFvTA0QXZDy0=/0x0:718x404/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 1720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mlNgWgB6_gbq0UkzcKZcSkVbMT8=/0x0:718x404/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif 1920w"" sizes=""(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EsMo2YYKsVViDxXaHwFoXNMtvMA=/0x0:718x404/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6301457/TThSe8T.0.gif"">  </picture>          That split-second deciphering from a slider to a fastball can cause swings like this of Trevor Plouffe\'s, even at 88 MPH.             In what was a night of weak contact for the Twins, Gallardo\'s trade-off was throwing an average of 17.8 pitches per inning. As PITCHf/x shows, Gallardo didn\'t cave to the pressure of meaty fastballs on the inner-half of the plate. Instead, Gallardo avoided the middle of the plate early in counts, using the right side and lower-half of the plate to set up hitters higher in zone. Gallardo obviously had a plan of attack, and though he wasn\'t as crisp as we\'d hope to see, it worked nonetheless. By cutting, sinking and spinning the baseball, Gallardo isn\'t going to give many hitters the opportunity to square him up, no matter the situation. Unfortunately, that does come at the risk of prolonging at bats. Gallardo fits in with the Orioles current rotation because his stuff doesn\'t afford him the risk of missing over the plate, but sometimes pitching is more finesse than sheer power. Gallardo wasn\'t trying to fool anyone when he explained how he\'s had to change his style, and as Wednesday night proved, it\'s a formula that can work. There are going to be frustrations in how Gallardo goes about his business, but changing speeds and eye-levels is the foundation of pitching. Mid-90\'s fastballs aren\'t always necessary. Forced to shed his former-self, Gallardo isn\'t going to ""wow"" us. His scheduled starts may even come with a passing yawn. But like most of his new teammates, he\'s different.    And I\'m a sucker for different. *Stats and media courtesy of Brooks Baseball and MLB.com*  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""O\\u2019s sweep Twins behind Joey Rickard's first career HR ..."", '  Ubaldo Jimenez, looking to build on a strong 2015 season that admittedly saw him falter in the second half, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t great out of the gate. He struck out the first batter he faced but allowed a solo shot to Joe Mauer to put the Orioles in a 1-0 hole. It would\xe2\x80\x99ve been a two-run dinger if Danny Santana, who\xe2\x80\x99d reached first base on a drag bunt, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been erased trying to steal second base. Caleb Throwseph has returned to play ball.  In the second inning, Eduardo Escobar singled into left field before John Ryan Murphy reached base on a weird play. He rocketed a ball directly at Chris Davis, who (according to the official scorer anyway) missed it. The ball skipped off the bag, bounced high into the air, and came to rest in between the rolled-up tarp and the first-base fence. Mark Trumbo did that thing where the fielder puts both hands in the air, and Escobar, who\xe2\x80\x99d crossed the plate easily, was sent back to third. He scored one batter later when Byron Buxton grounded out to J.J. Hardy. 2-0 Twins.  Jimenez may have been a bit rattled, or just a bit off to start the season, because he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the strike zone at all in the top of the 3rd. It looked like he was taking pitching tips from his 2014 self. His pitches were high in the zone and were often wide. Santana singled and stole second before moving to third base on a Mauer single. In a tight 2-0 game with no outs, it looked like a bad inning for the Orioles. But Jimenez recovered to strike out Miguel Sano and got a double-play comebacker from Trevor Plouffe.  From then on Jimenez was very difficult to hit. He struck out two batters in the 4th, one in the 5th, two in the 6th, and two in the 7th for a total of nine. Now, experienced Orioles fans are saying ""yeah, but how many did he walk?"" The answer is zero. ZERO.  Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line for the night was a very good 7 IP, 7 H, 9 K, 0 BB, HR, ER. He hadn\'t struck out nine while walking zero since September 19, 2013. The Orioles offense needed this performance because they struggled for most of the game. They had a good chance to score in the 4th but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come through. With Nolan Reimold and Manny Machado at the corners with no one out, Chris Davis, Mark Trumbo, and J.J. Hardy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring anyone home. It took until the 6th inning for the Orioles to score. They did it on a solo shot by Machado, on a fastball several inches inside, to make it 2-1 Twins.  The team broke through in the eighth. Again with runners on the corners thanks to back-to-back singles by Trumbo and Hardy, a brief rain delay ensued, bringing Trevor May in for starter Phil Hughes. May uncorked a wild pitch that scored Trumbo, tying the game at 2, and sending Hardy to second. One batter latter, Jonathan Schoop singled up the middle to bring home Hardy as the go-ahead run. 3-2 Orioles.  Franchise savior Dylan Bundy, pitching on 1,290 days of rest, was asked to hold the lead in the 8th, and hold it he did. He pitched around a single by Miguel Sano, and the inning ended when Sano\xe2\x80\x99s pinch-runner Eduardo Nunez was nailed stealing second by an absolute laser from Joseph. Bundy pumped his fist, smiled, and gracefully shouldered the expectations of an entire city and its fanbase before walking off the mound.  But in between innings, Bundy confided to Rule 5 pick Joey Rickard that he just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle all the pressure, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t Joey please help out? Rickard obliged with a solo homer, the first of his big-league career, to put the Orioles up 4-2. With the fans chanting ""JO-EY! JO-EY! JO-EY!"", Rickard shyly took a curtain call. Adorable!  Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day came in to get the save and did so by striking out the side in order. SWEEP!  The Orioles rise to 3-0 on the season while the Twins fall to the reverse.

For reference, FanGraphs says a WHIP of 1.00 or below is excellent and the average WHIP in 2015 was 1.29.1.12 strikeouts per inning pitched, which translated to 10.08 strikeouts per nine innings. A K/9 inning rate of 10.0 is rated as excellent. In 2015, the average K/9 inning for starters was 7.40.Now, the Twins aren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly the best hitting team in the world. Their average last year was .247, 26th in the league. Their on-base percentage was .305, 28th in the league.So, what can we take from these 2.5 starts? Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s not jump to any vast conclusions. Only two teams in baseball have allowed fewer runs so far, and they played each other in the first series, and also in the World Series last year.\xc2\xa0 The Mets and Royals also have only played two games at this point, allowing four and five runs respectively.But, what we can see is that the Orioles starting pitchers are off to a good start.\xc2\xa0 If the team can average six innings pitched throughout the year, it will allow Buck Showalter to continue his mastery of the bullpen.The other thing that appears to be the case, much like it was in 2014, is that the rotation is feeding off of a good start. When one pitcher has a good start, it motivates the others to keep pace.

""From the get-go, he was commanding his pitches. We just had to sit him out. He had one bad inning, and we took advantage.""Archer (0-2) allowed six runs and 10 hits over five innings. The Rays\' opening day hurler is winless in eight starts since Aug. 31 at Baltimore.""I made a few mistakes, and they definitely capitalized,"" Archer said.

It\'s the longest streak in the majors since Seattle connected in 23 straight games in 2013.But the Rays were limited to five hits, four of them singles.Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash gave credit to Tillman, who got off to a rocky start before dominating.""You could tell he was getting in a groove and just really quieted us down quite a bit,"" Cash said.Longoria\'s first home run of 2016 staked Tampa Bay to a first-inning lead. It was his seventh career homer off Tillman, the most against any pitcher.Davis tied it in the second with a shot to center, his second homer of the season and 800th career hit.Wieters put the Orioles ahead with an RBI single in the fourth, and Baltimore pulled away with a four-run fifth. Schoop started the barrage with a drive to center on Archer\'s first pitch of the inning, and two outs later Reimold and Machado connected in succession.Wieters made it 6-1 with a liner that struck Archer\'s glove and bounded away.The Orioles played a second straight game without center fielder Adam Jones, who is experiencing soreness in his ribcage.""Take another day and see how it feels,"" Jones said before the game.Baltimore shortstop J.J. Hardy also sat out the game with ""calf tightness,"" according to manager Buck Showalter.To fill the hole, Machado moved from third base to shortstop and Ryan Flaherty stepped in at third for his first action of the season.TRAINER\'S ROOMRays: Cash intended to shuffle his lineup this series to prevent some of his starters from pulling muscles in the cold.

04/09/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Team We Expect to See Winning Games', 'Apr 8, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman (30) throws a pitch in the second inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles improved to 4-0 on the young season with a 6-1 win over the Rays, doing so in the style expected of them by hitting four home runs.Tampa Bay starter Chris Archer threw 212 innings last year with a 3.23 ERA, giving up a total of 19 home runs. He gave up four solo shots on Friday night: a second inning blast by Chris Davis, and fifth inning homers to Jonathan Schoop, Nolan Reimold and Manny Machado.On the other hand, Orioles starter Chris Tillman was not as stellar as his abbreviated two-inning start on Opening Day, but he was still sufficiently good. He gave up just one run on four hits and two walks, the run being an Evan Longoria no-doubter in the first inning.\xc2\xa0 Again the O\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen was great, giving up only one hit in the final four innings.Tillman struggled some in the first three innings before having good fourth and fifth frames.Here are two issues I see with Tillman that get him into trouble.First, he often has a rough start in his games before settling down. The on-base percentage against him in both the first and second innings of pitching over his career is a not-so-great .348 in each. After that it settles down to much lower numbers. Tillman actually improves as games go along, which is backwards relative to most starters. Here is the career average of batters against him in the first, second, third and fourth times through the lineup: first = .269, second = .244, third = .240, and fourth = .208 (only a total of 52 plate appearances, but still impressive).Secondly, Tillman pitches much better with the bases empty and from the wind-up. In those situations he has an average against of .247 versus .258 with runners on base. That is not dramatically different and is probably true of most pitchers.But making it worse than it first appears is that Tillman too often (compared to most top starters) allows first batters of games and first batters in an inning on base. With game leadoff batters, his BAA/OBP is .287/.353, and with leadoff hitters in an inning it is .255/.323.\xc2\xa0 That .255 is the exact batting average of all hitters in the American League in 2015, and the OBP against Tilly is higher than the AL average of .318.But Chris Tillman pitched out of whatever jams he was in on Friday night, and his ball movement is clearly much better than in 2015, as is the velocity. This looks pretty good and bodes well for the future and for this season.So, I usually don\xe2\x80\x99t look at standings for at least several weeks of the season, but I looked to see if anyone else was still unbeaten in the AL, and yes, Detroit is 3-0. But they beat the Yankees, so that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.And we can\xe2\x80\x99t go getting too excited too quickly (just like we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get too depressed because it took 13 attempts to win a spring training game). The 2011 Baltimore Orioles started the season 5-0 and won eight of the first nine. But then they went 61-92 the rest of the way.Tracking and Prorating Home Runs and Strikeouts More from Baltimore Orioles5/8 - Baltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters Suits Up for His First Game Against Orioles5/8 - Baltimore Orioles Player Profile: Aderlin Rodriguez5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from AngelsAs written in the preseason, throughout the 2016 season here on The Baltimore Wire we will keep track of the pace of the Orioles relative to both home runs and strikeouts. For example, if the Orioles have over 500 strikeouts in the first 54 games (exactly one-third of a season), we will know that are on their way to challenging the all-time strikeout record of 1553.With only four games played, the current stats don\xe2\x80\x99t mean much, but to get the graph started on the season, here is where we are at this point \xe2\x80\xa6MLB All-Time HRsO\xe2\x80\x99s All-Time HRsO\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 Pace264 (Seattle \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9897)257 (1996)284MLB All-Time K\xe2\x80\x99sO\xe2\x80\x99s All-time K\xe2\x80\x99sO\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 Pace1553 (Hous \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9813)1331 (2015)1175\xc2\xa0So there is much to be encouraged about, even if it is only four games.

Mandatory Credit: Butch Dill-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles advanced \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d affiliate Frederick Keys shut out the Myrtle Beach Pelicans on Saturday evening, 6-0.Without an Orioles baseball game to follow and comment upon due to the winter weather last evening, I was able to fulfill my baseball fix by watching the Keys play on MiLB TV.Watching a minor league baseball game online has all the local fixins\xe2\x80\x99 that come along with the in-person experience, including all of the between-innings festivities. In Myrtle Beach this included a hoagie eating contest, a dog that brought baseballs to the umpire in a cloth basket, and advertisements for vacation trips and flights to \xe2\x80\xa6 wait for it \xe2\x80\xa6 West Virginia!Stimulating my interest in watching this particular game was the starting pitcher, Matthew Grimes. Through a set of circumstances, my wife and I have opened our home to host this very fine young man for this season or for whatever duration he has in Frederick. This is a first-time experience for us, but having young men in the house is nothing new. Four of our five sons have now grown up and moved out, only a college junior remains.If Grimes continues to pitch as he did tonight, his time with us might be fairly short. He threw five shutout innings for the win, giving up four hits and striking out seven, with no walks allowed. Matthew is 6\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d and throws over the top with a fastball that reaches at times to 96 mph. His game is to use his size to throw downhill and work the bottom of the zone, mixing in a variety of pitches.Grimes was a 2014 selection of the Orioles in the 18th round out of Georgia Tech. The Georgia native was among the top high school prospects in 2010, as evidenced by his fourth round selection by the White Sox. But he chose the Yellow Jackets instead and began his college career with a very good freshman year. But then came Tommy John surgery the following season, and he is really just now getting fully back to form at age 24.The 2015 season was a full year for Matthew, though his innings were capped. He pitched 126 at DelMarVa with a 10-7 record and 4.14 ERA.\xc2\xa0 His second half of the season was much improved over the earlier portion.The Keys offence gave Grimes a nice four-run lead in the top of the first inning. The big blow was a two-run shot by Aderlin Rodriguez, a Dominican player signed in the offseason by the O\xe2\x80\x99s to a minor league contract. He has been banging around the minors since signing with the Mets in 2008. Now age 24 and playing first base, he is a sizeable and athletic specimen at 6-3, 210. He also added a double and has started the season 6-for-14. With a great swing, batting cleanup, Rodriguez is an eye-catcher on this squad.The Keys feature four top-30 prospects on the roster, including Jomar Reyes who added a triple last night. At only age 19, the third baseman hit .278 in 84 games with the Shorebirds last year.While Reyes was ranked by Baseball America as the #4 prospect for the Orioles, the Keys also have #11 (Tanner Scott), #15 (Jonah Heim), and #28 (Josh Hart).Scott is already known to O\xe2\x80\x99s fans as the lefty with the 100 mph fastball, a rare talent. Between Aberdeen and DelMarVa, Scott threw 42.1 innings while striking out 60. The ERA was 3.83.

For a team without a lot of speed, base-running comes down to taking extra bases where available, and not running into outs. So far, so good.The offense has been excellent. Hitting home runs, including a barrage off of ace Chris Archer\xc2\xa0on Friday night. Patient at-bats were common, highlighted by Matt Wieters at-bat in the fourth inning, where he worked Archer for 10 pitches and drove an RBI single into left field.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 defense is always fantastic, and their one error so far probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an error.That leaves us with relief pitching. Everyone expected the Baltimore Orioles to have a very good bullpen this year. They brought back Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day on a big contract. They have closer Zach Britton, one of the best in baseball. Brad Brach has proven himself to be a very good set-up guy, and Brian Matusz is a capable left-handed specialist.Many people thought that Dylan Bundy and Mychal Givens would only help the already deep Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen. And then, there are guys like TJ McFarland, who was excellent on Friday night, to fill in as long relief.Statistically, the bullpen has pitched 17 innings so far, fifth most in the major leagues. Of course, this number is skewed by the short start Chris Tillman had on opening day due to the rain delay.The bullpen ERA over those 17 innings is 1.59, which is the eighth-best so far in the majors, but fourth-best in the AL East. The Blue Jays are the only one worse, and their bullpen has been a dumpster fire so far.Admittedly, it is a small sample size. But, for Oriole fans, there is one other thing to take note of here.All of the runs have been allowed by one person: Mychal Givens.Givens has pitched two innings of the 17 the team has pitched so far, yet has allowed the only three runs. After 2015, many thought the converted short stop was ready for a permanent spot in the O\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen. But he has struggled a bit so far this year, with 5 H allowed, 3 ER, 1 HR, 1 HBP. In 2015, Givens pitched 30 innings and allowed six runs. In 2016, Givens has pitched two innings and allowed three runs.

Quality Outings from the Starting RotationThe biggest reason why many people picked the Orioles to finish in the basement of the American League\xc2\xa0East was their weak starting rotation. \xc2\xa0Last season, the Orioles starters finished second-worst in the American League with a 4.53 ERA. \xc2\xa0The Orioles added Yovani Gallardo this offseason to help improve their rotation, but there are some concerns with his lack of velocity as his fastballs only reach the mid-80\xe2\x80\x99s.Orioles ace Chris Tillman, Ubaldo Jimenez and Yovani Gallardo all picked up opening week wins. \xc2\xa0Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s marvelous opening day start with five strikeouts in two innings was cut short due to a rain delay. \xc2\xa0On three days rest, Tillman returned with a solid start, tossing five innings and striking out five earning his first win of the year.When Ubaldo Jimenez is on the mound for the Orioles, you never know what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get. \xc2\xa0After allowing a run in the first two innings, Jimenez shifted into cruise control striking out nine in seven innings.3. Conquering the Bullpen Game\xc2\xa0The O\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen continues to progress as one of the best in the league. \xc2\xa0A bullpen that finished fifth last year with a 3.21 ERA shows no signs of declining. \xc2\xa0So far this year, the bullpen ERA over 21.1 innings is 1.27, third-best in the majors.Mychal Givens is the lone pitcher in the bullpen to give up a earned run. \xc2\xa0In hopes for a consistent Givens, the Orioles bullpen is loaded. \xc2\xa0They retained Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day to join one of the best closers in baseball, Zach Britton. \xc2\xa0Brad Brach is coming off a season where he posted a 2.72 ERA over 79.1 innings and has struck out seven in 4.1 innings in the Orioles opening week.Next: Baltimore Orioles go 5-0 on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s batThe 29-year-old left-hand veteran, Brian Matusz, is set to return from a back injury. \xc2\xa0The former fourth overall pick, Dylan Bundy appear as a relief pitcher which was his first major league appearance since 2013. \xc2\xa0Bundy threw one inning and allowed a hit in his return. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles stay undefeated with wild 9-7 win, spoiling Red ...', "" For the final time in a long career, the vandal David Ortiz took the field in front of a home crowd for a home opener. A long back and forth game unfolded in such a way that it may as well have been scripted, with Ortiz coming to the plate in the ninth inning, with two men on base, representing the go-ahead run.    In a dark era of the Orioles, we know how this game would have ended. In this era of the Orioles, the party was ruined and the O's held on by the skin of their teeth in a wild, 9-7 game. They are still undefeated in the 2016 season. This was not a game that the Orioles had any business winning on paper, even before the ninth inning drama came along. Former Cy Young winner and last year's runner-up David Price, Boston's new high-price free agent acquisition, was the one starting in the Fenway opener. He would be opposed by the Orioles' own free agent acquisition, Yovani Gallardo, who, well, doesn't have that pedigree. You could look at all of that and chalk it up as a loss.    The 86 mph blues In the first inning of the game, Gallardo was throwing... I don't even know what to call it. His fastball was at like 86 miles per hour, and the Red Sox were not missing it. It took until the fifth batter of the game for Gallardo to even record an out, and by the time he did so, the Orioles were already down 3-0. It was slop that he was throwing. He paid the price. The game seemed like it must be over already, the rest of the innings a mere formality.    A funny thing happened as the game moved along. Gallardo settled in - well, sorta - and Price ran into problems the second time through the order. A one out single by Caleb Joseph started a string of five consecutive batters reaching base, capped off by a three run home run out over the Fenway bullpens hit by Mark Trumbo, his first of the season. Abruptly the Orioles were ahead by a 5-3 score and Price did not look so great. No, Gallardo couldn't hold the lead. His velocity improved somewhat as the game went along, and he actually got as high as 89, but that wasn't enough to save him from the BABIP dragon. After a Brock Holt walk, a seeing eye single off the bat of Blake Swihart snuck just under Jonathan Schoop's glove.    Holt then scored when Jackie Bradley Jr. sliced a ball the opposite way and it bounced off the Fenway outfield dirt and into the stands for an automatic double. One batter later, the game was knotted at 5-5. Both Gallardo and Price ended up finishing five innings, somehow. Price struck out eight over five innings, giving up five runs on five hits and two walks. For Gallardo, he notched three strikeouts while giving up five runs, all earned, over five innings. The Sox touched him up for seven hits. That's a bad day - and it didn't matter thanks to the O's offense, even against an ace like Price. This is the kind of 2016 team we imagined we'd be seeing.    The bullpens enter the game Due to the peculiarities of the pitcher win rule, there was a brief period where Gallardo was lined up to be the winning pitcher even after giving up five runs. The O's scored in the top of the sixth while he was still the pitcher of record, back-to-back doubles by J.J. Hardy and Schoop putting the O's up 6-5. The lead did not last for very long. T.J. McFarland was tasked with the sixth inning. He issued a one out walk to Holt, a lefty, which is of course a no-no for a lefty. Holt advanced to third on a Swihart single and scored when Bradley hit what would have been a double play ball if not for high-cut Fenway grass slowing the ball down just enough. Oops. So things were knotted up again, 6-6. Orioles hitters were retired quickly in consecutive innings by Junichi Tazawa and Koji Uehara. Tazawa threw only ten pitches and Uehara threw only nine. Still, the O's bullpen held the line, Mychal Givens in the seventh - with some drama, like a two out double to Ortiz - and Brad Brach mowing them down 1-2-3 in the eighth. In the top of the ninth inning of a tie game of his home opener, Red Sox manager John Farrell turned to his new closer, Craig Kimbrel, acquired for a hefty cost of prospects over the offseason. It's not a bad plan, as long as that closer can throw strikes. Kimbrel was wild like a horse that couldn't drag me away. With one out, he walked Joseph, and he threw four balls to the next batter, Joey Rickard, though unfortunately the home plate umpire only called three of them and Rickard struck out. Still, Kimbrel went on to walk Manny Machado to put two men on for certified strong mammal Chris Davis, who had struck out three times already on the day.    On an 0-1 count, Kimbrel hurled a pitch in at 97 miles per hour. Davis flicked his wrists, swung the bat, and watched as his majestic dinger soared far into the Boston sky, landing high up on the Fenway center field seats that are tarped over for day games. Davis was circling the bases even as the souvenir and/or throw-it-back vultures fell over the tarp to try to grab the ball. The Orioles were winning just like that, 9-6. Kimbrel was booed by the Fenway faithful on his way off the mound as the inning ended. Welcome to the AL East, Craig. A dramatic ninth inning Zach Britton allowed only two baserunners in his first three games. Of course that wasn't going to last, and sure enough he gave up a leadoff home run to Mookie Betts. Well, no big deal, right? It was still just 9-7 and he had only three outs to get. No, it couldn't be that easy. Dustin Pedroia snuck a grounder between Hardy and Machado, and then, after a wild pitch sent Pedroia to second base, Britton walked Xander Bogaerts. That set up the maximum drama of the soon-to-be-retiring man who (in his mind) has never taken a pitch in the strike zone, Ortiz, representing the go-ahead run with no one out, at home, for the final home opener of his career. And him against Britton who'd already allowed one homer in the inning.    This could have been bad. It nearly was bad. When Ortiz finally made contact, it was a dribbler to Schoop, who had trouble getting it out of his glove right away. Schoop pitched to Hardy for one out, and Hardy fired on to Davis at first base. In a bang-bang play, Ortiz was out. The Red Sox futilely challenged the outcome of the play, because they had nothing to lose except for the 127 seconds of their lives that it took to rule on the challenge. Out is out, even when the player in question is about to retire. Britton's easy-as-you-please four pitch strikeout of Hanley Ramirez served as the denouement of the drama as well as any fifth act final scene in Shakespeare's oeuvre. The Orioles won a game that could have been a soul-suckingly miserable loss, one so bad as to sour the 5-0 start, if they had lost. They did not lose. Now they are 6-0, a record that no Orioles team has ever held before. It's only six games in April, but what fun it has been. They'll put their undefeated record on the line again tomorrow night against these same Red Sox. Mike Wright will finally make his season debut for the O's, while Clay Buchholz will grease his way to the mound for Boston.

Four different special uniforms for the 2016 season were unveiled on Wednesday afternoon. The Orioles will be saddled with these uniforms on Mother\'s Day, Memorial Day, Father\'s Day, and Independence Day. They range from, ""Well, that\'s nice"" to ""What feather-brain green-lit this monstrosity?"" Though they look ridiculous, I am aware that most and perhaps all of the special uniforms and hats will be auctioned off to benefit some kind of cause that is at least nominally charitable. For instance, last year\'s Fourth of July jerseys/caps were auctioned off with the proceeds benefiting the Orioles Charitable Foundation, while last year\'s Memorial Day uniforms and caps were auctioned, with proceeds going to support the Fort Meade Alliance.    It\'s safe to guess that the Mother\'s Day and Father\'s Day uniforms and caps, which are pink and blue, respectively, for the colors of breast cancer awareness and prostate cancer awareness, will be autographed and auctioned with proceeds going to some kind of charitable cause as well. And that\'s all well and good.    But come on, look at this stuff:  The #Orioles & @MLB introduce the lineup of special event uniforms for 2016! #Birdland pic.twitter.com/DS4DDYGxRQ\r \xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) April 13, 2016     What do you think it\'s like to be the person whose job it is to design that star-patterned cartoon bird cap? Do you think that he or she looks upon that finished product and feels a sense of satisfaction and thinks, ""Nailed it!"" Or do you think they are aware of what kind of abomination they have unleashed on the world, and that it leaves them feeling a little dead inside to know that they played a part in creating it?    Actually, the star pattern is the same for all 29 American teams. The only things different between them are the team logo that sits over the stars and whether the cap\'s primary color is red or blue. Toronto gets maple leafs instead, obviously. Also, the Orioles will be wearing light blue uniforms when playing the Blue Jays. That\'s just wrong! Not that anyone should have a hard time telling apart who\'s who, since one team will be in home whites and the other will be in road greys, but still. It\'s the principle of the thing. How many weird uniforms does one baseball season need? Are we far off from the first day of summer and the first day of fall being deemed worthy of specially-designed uniforms? Think of the falling leaf patterns they could use and the many colors! I\'d better not give them any ideas.    If there\'s any consolation, it\'s that each one of these peculiar things will be worn for only one game and then things will go back to normal. Though of course, if the O\'s do something really great on any one of these games, they\'ll have to keep wearing the uniforms until their luck runs out. Like what if someone throws a no-hitter on Memorial Day? Camo for the rest of the week! That\'s just science. We could have it worse than the above.

Incidentally, the Orioles haven\xe2\x80\x99t been contacted for permission to speak to Duquette either.

Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 owner Peter Angelos is a stickler for those types of details and regulations, and justifiably so. As was covered ad hoc when Toronto tried to pick Duquette off, Angelos stepped up to the plate and gave Duquette a contract extension and a raise after the 2012 season. He also famously expects people to honor their commitments. Again, justifiably so.And for the record, Duquette seems intent on completing his contract.

The Orioles are on pace to win 162 games and are turning Fenway Park into their own home run palace this week. Baltimore will try to bash its way to a series sweep and an 8-0 record to begin the season when it visits the Boston Red Sox for the finale on Wednesday. Baltimore rode its pitching staff to the first five wins but broke out the bats in the first two games against the Red Sox. Mark Trumbo homered in each of the first two games, Chris Davis bashed the tiebreaking three-run homer in the ninth inning on Monday and J.J. Hardy used Fenway\xe2\x80\x99s friendly dimensions to bloop a pair of homers down the right-field line in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s 9-5 victory. Boston\xe2\x80\x99s pitching staff has been just as shaky as feared the first 1 1/2 times through the rotation, with only two quality starts in the first seven games. The Orioles knocked around top two starters David Price and Clay Buchholz in the first two games of the series and will take their shots at Joe Kelly on Wednesday while countering with Ubaldo Jimenez. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Ubaldo Jimenez (1-0, 1.29 ERA) vs. Red Sox RH Joe Kelly (0-0, 21.00) Jimenez struggles with his control from time to time but was in the zone in his season debut against Minnesota, striking out nine without issuing a walk in seven innings en route to a win. The Dominican Republic native yielded eight hits but limited the damage to two runs \xe2\x80\x93 one earned \xe2\x80\x93 in the outing. Jimenez is 2-4 with a 7.26 ERA in 11 career starts against Boston, with one of those wins coming in four starts last season. Kelly allowed a run in the first inning on Friday in Toronto and made it through the next two scoreless before getting knocked around and failing to record an out in the fourth. The 27-year-old earned his spot in the rotation with a strong finish last season and a good spring but issued three walks in three-plus innings at Toronto before leaving the game after surrendering a grand slam. Kelly is 1-2 with a 5.40 ERA in five career starts against Baltimore. WALK-OFFS 1. Trumbo has four hits, two homers, five RBIs and four runs scored in the first two games of the series. 2. Red Sox RF Mookie Betts is 5-for-10 in the series after going 3-for-23 in the first five games. 3.

But hey, to quote the experts, it\xe2\x80\x99s early in the long season.Here are a few examples of what some writers are thinking and saying \xe2\x80\xa6Jerry Crasnick \xe2\x80\x93 ESPN \xe2\x80\x93 Reflecting on the incredible home run depth the Orioles have, along with their historic strikeout abilities, he quipped that \xe2\x80\xa6Short of luring Adam Dunn out of retirement, the Orioles couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done more to assemble a more high-stakes, hit-or-miss lineup.After the first several games, Crasnick made reference to the long ball fireworks, while also commenting that this is a team that could set both home run and strikeout records (as we are following that also here on The Baltimore Wire). And then, after the seven consecutive wins, he shared this tweet \xe2\x80\xa6My brother-in-law Brian, the emperor of Baltimore, has thanked me for picking #Orioles last and graciously offered me lodging in October.\xe2\x80\x94 Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) April 13, 2016Eddie Matz \xe2\x80\x93 ESPN \xe2\x80\x93 This writer certainly pulls in an Orioles fan with his headline, \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time to start believing in the Baltimore Orioles.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But does he believe?Believe might be a strong word, but he is impressed. And after noting that the Kansas City Royals started off 2015 winning seven straight, Matz also said of the Orioles\xe2\x80\xa6They\xe2\x80\x99ve faced both Chris Archer and Price \xe2\x80\x94 the two best starters the AL East has to offer \xe2\x80\x94 and slapped them around like pi\xc3\xb1atas, tallying a combined five dingers and 11 runs in just 10 innings.The writer lists five reasons the Orioles have begun the season well: surprising starters, dish discipline, fine fielding, Manny being Manny, and strength of schedule (actually, weakness thereof is what he means).Jonah Keri \xe2\x80\x93 CBS Sports \xe2\x80\x93 This very creative writer also begins an article by seeking to explain this early success by highlighting the strengths that are known and anticipated from the Orioles: the power lineup and the solid bullpen. He writes of this as the mark of the Buck Showalter teams in Baltimore, who \xe2\x80\x9chold opponents close in the late innings, and pummel them with homers.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it is correct to say that this is the preferred strategy of Showalter, but it is what the composition of the personnel presents as a way to win.Keri notes that nobody expected the Orioles to do as well as they have done in recent years, particularly to win in 2014. He links to this preseason\xe2\x80\x99s predictions by their staff of five MLB writers (including himself), all of whom call for the Oriole to finish last in the AL East.

Again.\xe2\x80\x9dOf course, all of this is very familiar to Baltimore Orioles fans. Even winning a World Series will not change it. They will be viewed as a one-year wonder who caught fire in a bottle. It is just the way it is. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles Hot Start: Luck Or Skill?', 'The Baltimore Orioles have started hot, but has it been because of good luck, skill, or a mix of both?I think one of the things I love most about baseball is just how ridiculous it can be. The incredible start that the Orioles have had is a prime example of that.\xc2\xa0 As it stands right now, after eight games, the Orioles stand atop the AL East at 7-1, having lost their first game last night to the Red Sox.If you had picked the Orioles to be dominating baseball before the season started, then I have a few lottery tickets I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to buy for me. Sure, some people expected the Orioles to be good, but to be this good? Not really.A few days back, Jeff Sullivan wrote an article looking at the standings and what teams have changed their playoff odds. No surprise, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 playoff chances increased the most, adding 14 percentage points to their odds.So what\xe2\x80\x99s happened? Why are they this good? Is it likely to continue? Well if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything I love as much as baseball, it\xe2\x80\x99s statistics, so let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at what exactly is going on with the Glorioles.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireNBA Playoffs: Recap, must-see highlights from Wizards vs. Celtics Game 43h agoBaltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters Suits Up for His First Game Against Orioles6h agoBaltimore Orioles Player Profile: Aderlin Rodriguez7h agoBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley1 d agoThe first thing everyone thinks of with the Orioles, and the big thing everyone was talking about in the preseason, is their hitting.\xc2\xa0 Earlier in the preseason, I wrote an article projecting the starting lineup stats for the team, and by my projections, they\xe2\x80\x99d be leading the league in home runs. Currently, the Orioles are tied for third with Houston and Seattle in home runs this year with 14, only five behind the leader (not surprisingly) Colorado.We all knew that Manny Machado and Chris Davis would hit, and we\xe2\x80\x99re expecting that, once he\xe2\x80\x99s back from the DL, Adam Jones will hit. But there have been some performances that have been pretty unexpected.First, we have Mark Trumbo, who has been hitting the ball like a madman, currently slashing .406/.441/.625. Now, we know Trumbo can hit home runs, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll probably hit 30 with the Orioles, but he\xe2\x80\x99s a career .252 hitter, he\xe2\x80\x99s never really had much of an average. Most of his .406 average is BABIP driven; it\xe2\x80\x99s at .423 right now, which is insanely high. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to lose about 200 points of batting average before the year is over. He\xe2\x80\x99s also historically a hot-starter, batting a career .262 with 80 HRs in the first half of the season, and .242 with 53 HRs in the second half. This is what he does.Apr 4, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles center fielder Joey Rickard (23) doubles during the fifth inning against the Minnesota Twins at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsNext, we have the name that\xe2\x80\x99s been sweeping Baltimoreans off their feet: Joey Rickard. While too many Orioles fans are busy burning their Hyun-Soo Kim effigies, Rickard has come in and started hitting, slashing .323/.343/.484 so far. Similar to Trumbo, much of this is BABIP-driven, which is sitting at .346. Most of what he\xe2\x80\x99s hitting in play is landing for a hit, and that\xe2\x80\x99ll correct itself.There is another thing concerning me about Rickard. One of the selling points for him was his speed, but he has yet to steal a base, or even to attempt it. He\xe2\x80\x99s had opportunities, he\xe2\x80\x99s been on base, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t tried to steal a base yet. Whether that\xe2\x80\x99s his fault or it\xe2\x80\x99s coaching, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, but my eyebrow is raised.Probably the best, and most surprising, thing the Orioles have been doing so far is their pitching. As of now, they have the sixth-best ERA in baseball, at 3.04, which is unexpected to say the least. One of the biggest question marks coming into this season was their pitching, but there\xe2\x80\x99s been some luck there too.First, there\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Tillman, who\xe2\x80\x99s only pitched seven innings, and while they\xe2\x80\x99ve been seven good innings, he\xe2\x80\x99s been getting lucky. First, there\xe2\x80\x99s his 40% K Rate (12.86 K/9) which is unheard of, and his .250 BABIP, which suggests a good bit of luck. Plus, despite his 1.29 ERA, his FIP is 3.03, which also suggests some luck.There\xe2\x80\x99s also the bullpen, which has about a 90% LOB rate and a mediocre FIP, which suggests a bit of a regression in the future, though I do think the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen will be one of the stronger bullpens in baseball. They\xe2\x80\x99re already tied for second in the MLB for saves.As expected, Yovani Gallardo has been bad, and perhaps most concerning is the fact that his fastball has dropped from 90 mph last year to 87 mph so far this year. If that stays, we\xe2\x80\x99re in for many more bad starts from Gallardo.One player that has really intrigued me so far though is Ubaldo Jimenez. In two starts, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a 3.75 ERA but a 2.92 FIP despite a ridiculously high .406 BABIP. A BABIP that high would normally come with a huge ERA, but not in Ubaldo\xe2\x80\x99s case, which is interesting to me. Plus, he\xe2\x80\x99s averaging 10 K/9 and is getting hitters to swing at stuff outside the strike zone more than he ever has before. I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting Ubaldo\xe2\x80\x99s going to win the Cy Young or something, but it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely something to watch.It\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that the statistics show the Orioles have had a lot of luck, that\xe2\x80\x99s to be expected when they\xe2\x80\x99re 7-1. And yes, this is the ultimate small sample size, but we know the Orioles can hit, they\xe2\x80\x99ve shown us that, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99ve been so fun to watch. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to score a ton of runs, and if they can do that and have a pitching staff that\xe2\x80\x99s even halfway decent along with a good bullpen, we might be in for a great season.

Everyone felt it coming at some point \xe2\x80\x93 even\xc2\xa0Tyler Wilson in the bullpen! But more on him in a moment. You\xe2\x80\x99d be hard-pressed to say that the O\xe2\x80\x99s slacked off in the Boston series simply because they lost a game. They still swept their first two series\xe2\x80\x99, taking two-of-three in the third one.It was a chilly night at Fenway Park, and while that was the case in the first two games also, it may have added to the sluggishness of Oriole bats. Luckily for the Birds, that will cease to be the case because they\xe2\x80\x99re in Texas for the weekend. Nevertheless,\xc2\xa0Ubaldo Jimenez wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite as sharp as he was in his first outing \xe2\x80\x93 but Fenway will do that to you. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 6 H, 4 R, 4 BB, 5 K.Let\xe2\x80\x99s put it this way; Jimenez probably put the Orioles in a position to win the game. The bats just didn\xe2\x80\x99t come through last night. However he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have his extra-good stuff, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen on some nights.

Perhaps the most impressive part of that was the fact that he hit the ball over the green monster in left field. Davis does on occasion muscle balls into the seats going the opposite way, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily an anamoly. However the fact that he was able to do it on a cold night in a park like Fenway means he\xe2\x80\x99s really seeing the ball well, and that his timing is spot on right now.However the lead was short-lived for the Birds. Boston would tie it up in the last of that same third inning on a Bogaerts two-RBI double. In the fourth inning they would take a 3-2 lead on an RBI-triple by Bradley, and they proceeded to extend that lead to 4-2 when Betts grounded out with a runner on third.

He tossed three scoreless innings, giving up two hits and striking out two.

That\xe2\x80\x99s a really, really tough job against a lot of big names over there, a good offense. Tyler, he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be engaged at all times.

He did a fantastic job.The O\xe2\x80\x99s did commit a few gaffes on the base paths, with both Hardy and Machado running into outs at third base. Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy is that if a player \xe2\x80\x9cfeels\xe2\x80\x9d the ability to stretch a double into a triple or something of the like, they should go for it.

The Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 red-hot bats have cooled a bit as they\xe2\x80\x99ve followed a franchise-best 7-0 start by scoring just five runs in back-to-back losses. The Orioles look to snap their modest skid and even their four-game series with the host Texas Rangers when the clubs meet on Friday at Globe Life Park in Arlington. Offseason acquisition Mark Trumbo belted his third homer in four games in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 6-3 setback against Texas on Thursday and is 4-for-9 with one blast in his career versus Friday starter Martin Perez. While the Orioles were hot from the start, the Rangers have heated up with five wins in their last seven contests. Elvis Andrus recorded an RBI single on Thursday as Texas claimed its seventh win in eight meetings with Baltimore and is 6-for-11 with three runs scored in his last three contests. Adrian Beltre is riding a team-best seven-game hitting streak and has reached safely in all but one game this season. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Vance Worley (0-0, 3.86 ERA) vs. Rangers LH Martin Perez (0-1, 3.65) Worley\xe2\x80\x99s season debut on Sunday was hardly a thing of beauty, but he was in line for the victory as he allowed three runs and seven hits before being pulled with two outs in the fifth inning versus Tampa Bay. The 28-year-old was limited to just 79 pitches in that contest but expects a longer outing on Friday. Worley had a better showing in his lone appearance against Texas on April 25, 2013, permitting two runs and six hits over five innings of a losing effort. Perez struggled with his control in his second straight start on Sunday, following up his four-walk performance in his initial outing with five more free passes in a 3-1 setback against the Los Angeles Angels. The 25-year-old Venezuelan didn\xe2\x80\x99t walk a batter in his last encounter with Baltimore, retiring the first 14 hitters he faced before allowing a three-run homer. Perez overcame a bit of turbulence to pick up the win and improve to 2-1 lifetime versus the Orioles. WALK-OFFS 1. Texas rookie RF Nomar Mazara recorded two hits in the series opener to improve to 8-for-20 (.400) with three RBIs and three runs scored in five contests this season. 2. Baltimore 3B Manny Machado is riding a season-opening nine-game hitting streak. 3. Rangers 2B Rougned Odor highlighted a five-run sixth inning on Thursday with a two-run double \xe2\x80\x93 his fourth two-base hit in the last four contests.

Mark Trumbo has fit right in with the free-swinging Baltimore Orioles, going deep twice on Friday to increase his home run total to five in his last five contests. The offseason acquisition looks to continue his impressive power display on Saturday as the visiting Orioles play the third contest of their four-game series versus the Texas Rangers. Trumbo launched a two-run blast in the seventh and capped the nine-run inning with a three-run shot as Baltimore snapped a modest two-game overall skid and five-game losing streak against Texas with an 11-5 triumph on Friday. The 30-year-old has collected 11 RBIs in his last five contests and gone deep among a 4-for-16 stretch against Saturday starter Colby Lewis. Texas, which had won five of seven before getting trampled by Trumbo, will be playing its 13th contest of 14 in 14 consecutive days to start the season on Saturday. Veteran Adrian Beltre reportedly agreed to a two-year contract extension worth $36 million on Friday but saw his hitting streak snapped at seven games heading into Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s tilt versus former Ranger Yovani Gallardo. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Yovani Gallardo (1-0, 5.40 ERA) vs. Rangers RH Colby Lewis (1-0, 3.00) Gallardo posted a 13-11 record and 3.42 ERA in his lone campaign with Texas before signing a two-year, $22 million deal with Baltimore in the offseason. The 30-year-old Mexican enjoyed success in Arlington as well, winning eight of his 14 decisions to help the Rangers reel in a playoff berth. Gallardo was fortunate to walk away with a no-decision on Monday after allowing five runs and seven hits in five innings against Boston. Lewis picked up his first win of the season on Monday after permitting one run and four hits in six innings of a 7-3 victory over Seattle. The 36-year-old managed to post a win in his last meeting with the Orioles despite yielding five runs and six hits in as many frames, improving his career mark versus the club to 2-4 with a gaudy 6.11 ERA. Lewis has struggled with J.J. Hardy, who enters Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s contest with a five-game hitting streak and is 6-for-18 (.333) with two homers versus the hurler. WALK-OFFS 1. Texas CF Delino DeShields is 8-for-17 with one homer, three RBIs and four runs scored in his last four games. 2. Baltimore 2B Jonathan Schoop homered twice on Friday and has hit safely in all but one game this season. 3. Rangers rookie OF Nomar Mazara is 9-for-23 with four RBIs in six contests.

Honestly, Gallardo and Tillman have deserved bit better fates than they have received, but this is not going to be a league-leading rotation. Some days they will be good, other times they will be awful.The Orioles have one of the best managers in baseball, but there is little to be said to defend the decision to send Gallardo out in the seventh inning on Saturday evening. But he believed in his guy and believed he could get a couple more outs and save one extra reliever being used. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.

They of course had a six-game homestand, followed by a seven-game road swing (shortened to six games due to the rainout). However now they return home for three games against division rival Toronto, before heading out on the road for another six games in Kansas City and Tampa.However with the unbalanced schedule, I suspect that every team will have a stretch like that.

The Baltimore Orioles have cooled since their historic start with losses in three of the last four games. The Orioles will have had two full days off to get their momentum changed when the host the Toronto Blue Jays in the opener of a three-game series on Tuesday. Baltimore won seven straight to open the season \xe2\x80\x93 its best start since moving from St. Louis following the 1953 season \xe2\x80\x93 but dropped three of the next four before Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s finale at Texas was postponed. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching staff was strong the first time through the rotation but started to show some cracks on the second turn while surrendering an average of 5.8 runs in the last six games. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s slugging lineup is matched by few teams in the majors but the Blue Jays happen to be one of those few with Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion and Troy Tulowitzki in the middle of the order. Tulowitzki drove in a run and Donaldson and Bautista each scored during a four-run rally in the eighth inning on Monday that earned Toronto a 4-3 win and a split of the four-game series at Boston. PITCHING MATCHUP: Blue Jays RH Marcus Stroman (2-0, 4.22 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Mike Wright (1-0, 7.20) Stroman sandwiched two quality starts around one dud in his three outings and limited the New York Yankees to two runs on three hits and two walks in eight innings to earn a win on Thursday. The Duke product went eight frames on opening day as well but was knocked around for five runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings without factoring in the decision against Boston on April 8. Stroman faced Baltimore on Sept. 30 last season and scattered one run and five hits over eight innings while striking out eight to pick up a win. Wright was skipped the first time through the rotation but will avoid another skip despite the rainout on Sunday, with the Orioles electing to push everyone back a day instead. Wright was knocked around for four runs on five hits and a walk in five innings at Boston in his first start on April 12 but got enough support from the offense to come out of it with a win. The 26-year-old was knocked around by Toronto during his 2015 rookie campaign, going 0-2 with a 9.45 ERA in three appearances \xe2\x80\x93 two starts. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles DH Pedro Alvarez is 4-for-24 with one extra-base hit on the season. 2. Toronto CF Kevin Pillar is 6-for-7 in two games since being dropped from the leadoff spot in the order. 3.

Owning an early 65.2 GB%, Stroman is going to cut it, sink it, slide it, curve it and change it without fear of count or situation. Having nearly abandoned the four-seam fastball, Stroman\'s consistent avoidance of the barrel of the bat has been the key to his success so far in April. Stroman wears his emotions far beyond his sleeve, and given the recent bad-blood between the two clubs, we may see fireworks early in the year.              <picture class=""c-picture"" data-cid=""site/picture_element-1494277533_2730_669"" data-cdata=\'{""picture"":true,""dynamic_picture"":false,""convert_picture"":false}\'>            <img srcset=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a38t57O2-yqieOIOHuLr7S4M1d0=/0x0:718x404/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6358217/IsUmo9I.0.gif 320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QO8Jcctnqio8UhAWH6i9Zg00ekg=/0x0:718x404/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6358217/IsUmo9I.0.gif 520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ciJWNKSY2cGa2-XFxbob8imkev0=/0x0:718x404/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6358217/IsUmo9I.0.gif 720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KeqgDJh7AdNktNe6mW19sF_9gS4=/0x0:718x404/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6358217/IsUmo9I.0.gif 920w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oJYkf2Akz-xppMVbEw_1Qq8hfGU=/0x0:718x404/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6358217/IsUmo9I.0.gif 1120w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rw9pmUNXifAmIYNWaKozOoBsNkc=/0x0:718x404/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6358217/IsUmo9I.0.gif 1320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQ2MvdMBhMa5Hz95l16rkjKZMNA=/0x0:718x404/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6358217/IsUmo9I.0.gif 1520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9F1doOV1tyJRoXpaRgZED70gmVQ=/0x0:718x404/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6358217/IsUmo9I.0.gif 1720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iKQeG2pjwEV1tJc_i5sHKtHx9Xg=/0x0:718x404/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6358217/IsUmo9I.0.gif 1920w"" sizes=""(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PU5qBHx5OeAuJuKAYy_1ZbOUAn4=/0x0:718x404/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6358217/IsUmo9I.0.gif"">  </picture>          This is going to be a solid test for Wright, who was undone by the Jays in 2015. Surrendering a 9.45 ERA and 1.168 OPS in three games, Wright will be in for another major battle with one of baseball\'s best fastball hitting teams. Already in 2016, Wright has seen an uptick in curveball usage, with a slight rise in slider frequency as well. We know Wright throws hard, but especially so against the Blue Jays, his off-speed command will be the ultimate gauge to his effectiveness. If you can\'t change speeds around Toronto\'s lineup, you eventually succumb to predictability.    Game 2 Probables R.A. Dickey (1-2, 6.75 ERA) vs. Ubaldo Jimenez (1-0, 3.75 ERA) Dickey goes as the knuckleball goes, and so far this year, the pitch that defies gravity has been launched around the stratosphere. When the ball isn\'t being put in play (20.6 K% to 11.0 BB%), Dickey\'s knuckleball has fallen victim to a 166 wRC+ and .366 BABIP, much to be explained by his 26.0% line drive rate. It\'s impossible to know how the fingernails happen to grip the baseball on any given day, but Dickey has nested in the middle of the plate in his three starts thus far, and the Orioles hot bats won\'t mind an evening with a floating knuckler. Like Dickey, you never know what Ubaldo you\'re going to see on a particular evening, but in his first two starts, he\'s been good Ubaldo. Despite a .406 BABIP, Jimenez has struck out nearly 30% of batters faced thus far, and even more encouraging, his stuff is playing to its purpose, having induced ground balls three times as often as fly balls. Eventually his BABIP will normalize, but Jimenez may find that take until after his next start if he, like Wright, is unable to successfully mix his stuff and avoid the middle of the plate.    Game 3 Probables Marco Estrada (1-0, 2.77 ERA) vs. Chris Tillman (1-1, 5.11 ERA) Estrada is essentially a clone of Yovani Gallardo, though he\'s dropped the blueprint on how to pitch with a fastball that ranges from 84-89 MPH. Relying on a majority of fastballs, cutters and changeups, Estrada does his best to keep hitters leaning forward rather than waiting back, and it\'s a strategy he\'s mastered. Weak contact and frustrating at-bats are going to test the Orioles in the actuality of their supposed newfound plate discipline. Oh, Tilly. You trifling tease. We want to love you again, but it has to go both ways. Meet us in the middle. Regardless of his complicated love affair with the fine folks of Baltimore, the BABIP monster from under your bed is currently dwelling beneath Tillman\'s, and it hasn\'t been kind. A current .343 mark on the year sounds less merciful considering in Tillman\'s six starts against the Jays last season, his .345 BABIP led to a 1.129 OPS and 11.29 ERA. Find a happy place...find a happy place... TIllman is adjusting however. Fewer knuckle-curves are being replaced with more changeups and sliders, a pair of pitches more prone to be called strikes. Perhaps two-inning Tillman is still a possibility, and if there was ever a time for us to see the charged up Chris Tillman, it would certainly come against the team that singlehandedly catapulted his ERA to nearly 5.00.    ----------------------------------------------------------- Overall, I\'d imagine we see the Orioles stay hot at home and the Blue Jays bats reawaken courtesy of the O\'s mediocrity on the mound. Though only 11 games into the season, this is very much a series that can set the tone for the rest of the year, good or bad. If the Orioles want to once again win the AL East, these are exactly the teams that the O\'s need to best. Improving on an 8-11 record against the Jays from a year ago will not only measure what this Orioles team is, but taking a series against a division rival can surely be a boost to the system, even in April.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. ', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Tuesday Bird Droppings: Where the Orioles will finally ...', ' Hello, friends. I don\'t know about you, but I\'m starting to get twitchy without any Orioles baseball. This is April, for crying out loud. We\'re not supposed to go 72 hours or so without any baseball that matters. You can steel yourself for that during the All-Star Break, but now, it\'s not so easy. Yet that\'s what a rainout - when it maybe wasn\'t raining during game time - plus an off day will give us.    The good news is that the Orioles remain in first place in the AL East after the weekend\'s shenanigans, holding onto a 2.5 game advantage over their nearest competitors, the Red Sox, who blew the Patriot\'s Day game in hilarious fashion. The beneficiaries of that bullpen struggle were the Blue Jays, a less than perfect outcome for the O\'s, but, you know. Those same Jays come to Camden Yards to start a three game series tonight. I have no excitement whatsoever over the prospect of Mike Wright running into this Jays lineup. Perhaps somewhat appropriately, tonight\'s game is the first this season where I will be in attendance. This may not go down among the great decisions of my life. Now on to the links. A couple of minor news items to get out of the way before the usual assortment.    Around the blogO\'sphere Phillies acquire outfielder Alfredo Marte from Orioles | Comcast SportsNet PhiladelphiaAlfredo Marte was one of those spring training All-Stars for the Orioles, except he isn\'t a Rule 5 pick so he was guaranteed nothing. Now, with Norfolk having a billion outfielders, Marte gets shipped to the Phillies, whose left fielders are batting a combined .075/.098/.150, which is, uh... how does that even happen?    Report: Orioles have made an offer to Kyle Lohse \xe2\x80\x93 HardballTalkI wrote about their rumored interest in Lohse last week, and it seems like the O\'s are the only team who\'s made Lohse an offer as of now. Probably it\'s a minor league deal, because there\'s no harm in adding him to the Norfolk rotation and seeing what happens. Orioles\' Mark Trumbo named co-AL Player of the Week - Baltimore SunThis is the first time in Trumbo\'s career that he has been so honored. Let\'s hope it\'s not the last time he gets the award this season.    Upstart Orioles -- Whose hot (or cold) starts are real? - MLB (ESPN - Insider required)At ESPN, Tony Blengino is feeling sunny about J.J. Hardy and Jonathan Schoop, but not so sunny about Matt Wieters and Joey Rickard. Surgically repaired Matt Wieters looks just like the old Matt Wieters - Baltimore SunOne must wonder when was the last time that the headline writer saw Matt Wieters. Though there are some good things here - including the excitement over a 1.77 pop time - Wieters still hasn\'t caught consecutive games on consecutive days, and there is this sentence to grapple with: ""He\'s ... doing more than his .233/.324/.300 line tells."" Is he, though? The rise and fall of Rafael Palmeiro (Fox Sports)Palmeiro thinks he could hit .270 and slug 25 home runs this season if somebody had asked him to do so. He also hasn\'t been back to Baltimore since his career ended. OK then. This is an interesting article, by the way. If you only click on one link today, make it this one.    School of Roch: Orioles\' infield defense has been golden Based on a small sample size viewed through orange colored lenses, I\'d say just go ahead and give them all Gold Gloves right now. Steve Melewski: A look at the O\'s minor league pitcher that started his career with 32 2/3 scoreless inningsBuried lede: His name is Christian Turnipseed. Other buried lede: He\'s 23 and pitching in Low-A. But he should be proud of the success he\'s had so far in his professional career nonetheless. Birthdays and anniversaries There are three former Orioles with birthdays today. They are: Flat Brim himself George Sherrill, 1998-99 short-timer Willie Otanez, and 1997-99 pitching presence Scott Kamieniecki. Is today your birthday? Happy birthday! Along with those former Orioles, your birthday buddies for today include: law man Eliot Ness (1903), auto racing magnate Jack Roush (1942), Clue (and others) actor Tim Curry (1946), actress/Kentucky fan Ashley Judd (1968), actress Kate Hudson (1979), and career Grand Slam-winning tennis star Maria Sharapova (1987). On this day in history... This was a significant day in many periods of American history, mostly for ill.    In 1775, the first battle of the Revolutionary War took place at Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts - the American colonists were victorious at Concord. In 1861, in what\'s regarded as the first blood shed during the Civil War, a mob of Confederate sympathizers attacked Union troops marching between train lines in Baltimore. Four Union soldiers and twelve of the sympathizers were killed in the skirmish. In 1865, the funeral service for President Lincoln was held in the East Room of the White House. In 1993, the Waco siege ended when the building caught fire. A total of 82 people were killed in the building, 76 in the fire at the end, as well as four ATF agents who were killed while executing a search warrant at the beginning of the siege. In 1995, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was bombed, killing 168 people. This remains the worst act of domestic terrorism in American history.    In 2013, Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in an early morning shootout with police; brother and fellow bomber Dzokhar was captured later in the day after being found in a boat in somebody\'s back yard in Watertown, Massachusetts. ** And that\'s the way it is on April 19 - at least, until something happens later.

Jimenez left the game after the fifth inning with a 3-2 lead.Encarnacion\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double in the seventh would tie the game, disqualifying Jimenez for the win. However it was an inning before that in which we saw the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 defense starting to take over. With a runner on second, Thole sent a bleeder towards Rickard in left. Rickard made a diving attempt at the ball, however it ticked off his glove\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6luckily for him, it stayed close. Furthermore, he recovered quickly. With two outs and the runner coming to the plate, Rickard picked up the ball and fired home. When all was said and done, he nailed the runner down at home plate.One inning later, Bautista smacked a flair to center, and Jones dove out fully extneded to make the catch. For whatever reason, the runner at third decided not to tag up, and when Jones gunned the ball home he had to stay at third. Now that runner would later score, however the point is that for the moment Jones\xe2\x80\x99 defense saved a run.\xc2\xa0More from Adam Jones7/21 - Baltimore Orioles: Headed to sick bay6/29 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones: Hometown boy makes good6/26 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 comeback started with an Adam Jones catch6/25 - Baltimore Orioles brought back on the bat of Adam Jones6/17 - Baltimore Orioles: Adam Jones swings Birds into firstCourtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsBoth of these plays embody what the Orioles are about.With Jones you pretty much expect it at this point, however we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose sight of the fact that Rickard is a Rule 5 pick \xe2\x80\x93 he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even supposed to be here. And on that play make no mistake about the fact that he made a perfect throw. Joseph was able to receive the ball and tag the runner high. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure he ever touched home plate. As Clint Eastwood said at the end of\xc2\xa0In the Line of Fire,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6AIM HIGH!\xe2\x80\x9dBut ultimately with the game tied, we went to extra frames. The O\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t get cooking until there were two outs in the last of the tenth, when they eventually loaded the bases. And keep in mind that anything can happen with the bases loaded, even a wild pitch or pass ball. And with Joseph on third, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what happened. It was ruled a pass ball, however it could have gone either way. Joseph scored from third when the ball trickled away from home plate, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s defeated Toronto 4-3.Again however, make no mistake about the fact that defense won this game for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Given that it ended on a pass ball perhaps one could say that defense lost it for Toronto, but I digress. It\xe2\x80\x99s plays like what Joey Rickard and Adam Jones turned in last night which win titles.

Two American League division leaders face off when the Baltimore Orioles visit the Kansas City Royals on Friday to begin a three-game series. Baltimore leads the AL East at 10-4 after winning its last two against Toronto as Manny Machado extended his hitting streak to 14 contests while the Royals are 6-2 at home on the way to a one half-game lead in the AL Central. Machado is one of three Orioles (Brian Roberts and Eddie Murray) to start a season by hitting safely in 14 straight games and can set a new career high on Friday. Baltimore will send Yovani Gallardo to the mound to try and improve on the team\xe2\x80\x99s 3-3 record on the road. Kansas City (10-5), which won four of seven against the Orioles last season, took two of three versus Detroit earlier this week. Eric Hosmer has recorded at least one hit in 11 consecutive games for the Royals and reached base in 23 straight regular-season contests, dating back to the 2015. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Yovani Gallardo (1-0, 5.63 ERA) vs. Royals RH Chris Young (0-3, 7.90) Gallardo has given up nine runs over 11 innings in his last two starts after producing a solid performance in his season debut. The 30-year-old Mexican, who signed as a free agent in the offseason, has walked six and struck out nine in three outings with his new team. Omar Infante (1-for-12) has struggled against Gallardo, who has been dominant in two career starts versus Kansas City (1-0, 1.93 ERA). Young is coming off one of his best seasons (11-6) but has not carried over that performance, permitting 12 runs over 13 2/3 innings in his first three starts of 2016. The 36-year-old Texan had his best outing at home, allowing two runs and three hits over five frames. J.J. Hardy is 0-for-9 with three strikeouts versus Young, who is 2-1 with a 3.52 ERA in five career appearances (four starts) against Baltimore. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles RHP Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day has not allowed a run in eight outings (7 1/3 innings) this season and Baltimore is 8-0 in games he has pitched. 2. Royals 3B Mike Moustakas is 6-for-16 with a pair of homers during his four-game hitting streak. 3. Baltimore rookie LF Joey Rickard has reached base in his first 14 major-league games, recording at least one hit in 13 of them.

(AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Dillon Gee hadn\xe2\x80\x99t pitched since April 16, in part because he was on paternity leave for the birth of his daughter. He was solid in relief of struggling starter Kris Medlen on Saturday night, but the Kansas City Royals still fell to the Baltimore\xc2\xa0Orioles\xc2\xa08-3. Gee allowed three hits, struck out five and walked none in 4 1/3 scoreless innings. It was the first hit that irked Gee \xe2\x80\x94 a two-run double to Mark Trumbo, who drove in four runs. Those runs went on Medlen\xe2\x80\x99s ledger and gave the\xc2\xa0Orioles\xc2\xa0a 7-2 lead. \xe2\x80\x9cIt frustrates me that I cashed in two of Medlen\xe2\x80\x99s runs,\xe2\x80\x9d Gee said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s still on my mind.

Davis, who led the majors with 47 home runs last season, hit his sixth homer in the second inning and had an RBI single during the\xc2\xa0Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 four-run fourth. He tied a career high for hits and hiked his average from .192 to .246. Davis hit Medlen\xe2\x80\x99s first pitch out to lead off the second. \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Medlen said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe consistently hits 40-50 homers a year. He\xe2\x80\x99s a good hitter and I left a ball right over the plate, a fastball right down the middle.\xe2\x80\x9d Machado singled in his first at-bat and doubled in a run in the fourth. He is hitting an American League-leading .397. Medlen (1-1) allowed seven runs on nine hits and three walks in 3 2/3 innings. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my experience in dealing with this a couple of times, you just turn the page and get over it pretty quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d Medlen said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fairly certain I was doing wrong mechanically and whatever else. Try to made adjustments in between. Try to bounce back.\xe2\x80\x9d Trumbo extended his hitting streak to eight games and has 10 RBIs in that time. He\xe2\x80\x99s second in the AL behind Machado with a .381 average. Wilson had made three relief appearances this season. He went five-plus innings and allowed three runs and six hits, including Salvador Perez\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer in the second. The Royals loaded the bases in the sixth on Davis\xe2\x80\x99 error, Kendrys Morales\xe2\x80\x99 single and Alex Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s walk. Rookie right-hander Mychal Givens, the third\xc2\xa0Orioles\xc2\xa0pitcher of the inning, struck out Perez and Omar Infante to end the inning. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a couple of opportunities to crawl back in, but we just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a timely hit to push some runs across and make it a different ball game,\xe2\x80\x9d Royals manager Ned Yost said.

04/25/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: A look back at civil unrest - Birds Watcher', ""It\xe2\x80\x99s almost fitting that the Baltimore Orioles find themselves in Tampa starting tonight. However unlike right around this time last year, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be the visiting team at Tropicana Field. The weekend which corresponds with this coming weekend (last year, that is) saw the O\xe2\x80\x99s hosting Tampa. However due to circumstances beyond anyone\xe2\x80\x99s control, that series was moved to Tampa \xe2\x80\x93 with the O\xe2\x80\x99s as the home team\xe2\x80\xa6on the road.We all remember what happened, and it was all covered ad hoc on this site. One year ago today, the Orioles were hosting the Boston Red Sox at Oriole Park, in a game that became marred by the civil unrest which was occurring around the city and around the ballpark before and during the game. One of the windows in Dempsey\xe2\x80\x99s Brew Pub was broken, numerous cars were vandalized, and even some fans attending the game were intimidated by protesters.This of course was only the first act in a week-long saga surrounding the death of Freddie Gray at the hands of the Baltimore City Police. April 27th brought an evenCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsworse situation, with full blown riots brewing citywide, prompting the cancellation of that evening\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 game vs. Chicago. The next evening\xe2\x80\x99s game was canceled as well, and the scheduled game on April 29th was moved to a matinee\xe2\x80\xa6in front of an empty Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

It showed the determination of the city of Baltimore, which I know has always been there. We saw it in 1814 when the city withstood the British bombardment with the defense of Fort McHenry, prompting Francis Scott Key to write what we later called our national anthem. There\xe2\x80\x99s a certain defiance of circumstances which is truly Baltimorean. The Orioles are so much a part of the pysche of this city, and thus the people weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be kept from their team.I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to turn this into a political column, however the fact is that there were aspects on both sides of the situation that both fueled things and led to them. However there can be no doubt that those who aimed to do harm to the city and private property had no business doing what they did. It caused the city to look bad, and so many lives to be altered \xe2\x80\x93 in some cases permanently. Our society is not perfect, and perhaps if we accept that as opposed to constantly trying to change it we might do better than having incidents like these. In essence, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that humanity itself will never be perfect. We can try, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll constantly fall short.

But this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about baseball, nor should it have been. It\xe2\x80\x99s about justice \xe2\x80\x93 both in the area of criminal justice, as well as in civil security. We can\xe2\x80\x99t look past the event(s) that led to the riots; we just can\xe2\x80\x99t. Those issues need to be addressed, and not just in Baltimore. It\xe2\x80\x99s a nationwide struggle. However we also can\xe2\x80\x99t use those events to excuse or pardon the riots themselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s really that simple.The Orioles represented Baltimore to the nation and the world with an unbelievable amount of grace and understanding while all of this was going on. And when they finally returned home after a road trip, for the first time in history they wore home uniforms that said BALTIMORE as opposed to ORIOLES. That in solidarity with the city and it\xe2\x80\x99s people \xe2\x80\x93 regardless of which side of the divide they fell. Next: Baltimore Orioles: Mike Wright loses with hard luckThis week marks the anniversary of those events, as I said. My hope is that we never forget why the events occurred, and perhaps in the future think of what should be done to prevent them from happening again.

A struggling prospect who was near the end of being considered a prospect (Arrieta) and a good reliever (Strop) for a decent starting pitcher (Feldman) and a backup catcher (Clevenger). It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a blockbuster deal by any means, and it barely registered on the radar of anyone who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fan of either team, but it\xe2\x80\x99s ended up being known as one of the biggest trade blunders in Orioles, and probably baseball, history. And I\xe2\x80\x99m here to say that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be at all. The trade was a fair trade.It seems stupid to say that now, considering what Jake Arrieta has become. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s a Cy Young winner who\xe2\x80\x99s thrown two no-hitters. He threw an incredible 1.77 ERA last year, and has so far had a 0.80 ERA this year. The guy is putting up Clayton Kershaw numbers (minus a few strikeouts) and I think you could absolutely make the argument that he\xe2\x80\x99s the best pitcher in baseball.To understand this trade, and to understand why the trade made complete sense at the time, you have to understand what Arrieta was when he was with the Orioles, not what he became. At the time of the trade, Arrieta was 27 years old, and had already logged 358 innings in his career with a 5.46 ERA. His best year in the majors, he pitched 100.1 innings with a 4.66 ERA and only 4.66 K/9.Arrieta was part of a batch of young pitching prospects for the Orioles that was supposed to be an all-star rotation of the future. Along with Chris Tillman, Brian Matusz, and Zach Britton, Arrieta was supposed to be a future star. He had incredible stuff, everyone saw it, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t coming together. He was walking people left and right, he had no control and his stuff was eminently hittable. After five years of Arrieta, the Orioles were ready to cut bait and see if someone else wanted to take a chance on him.Apr 21, 2016; Cincinnati, OH, USA; Chicago Cubs starting pitcher Jake Arrieta (left) is congratulated by catcher David Ross (right) after Arrieta pitched a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park. The Cubs won 16-0. Mandatory Credit: David Kohl-USA TODAY SportsIn exchange they got Scott Feldman, who at the time was doing pretty well for the Cubs. Feldman was 30, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be an all-star, but with his 3.46 ERA at the time, and his .227 BAA, he was going to be one of the best pitchers on the Orioles, that\xe2\x80\x99s how badly the team needed a pitcher. The Orioles were vying for a playoff spot, they were just 2 \xc2\xbd games out of first place, and needed someone to sure up the rotation, and for that, they traded a seemingly lost prospect and a reliever. Even Feldman\xe2\x80\x99s teammate at the time, Jeff Samardzija, was upset that Feldman was leaving, saying he didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe Feldman\xe2\x80\x99s departure improved the team, and wondered why the guy had to go.Now, there seems to be more to this story, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the contentious part. As far as Arrieta is concerned, it\xe2\x80\x99s essentially the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching staff\xe2\x80\x99s fault that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t fulfill his potential in Baltimore. He believed that the Orioles were messing around with his delivery and his pitches, forbidding him from throwing a cut fastball and not letting him throw the way that felt natural to him. Once he got to the Cubs, the reins were off and he could do what he wanted, and he believes that\xe2\x80\x99s what got him to where he is now.oriolesCall to the Pen 2dCurt Schilling Continues to be an EmbarrassmentMore headlines around FanSided:2d - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday2d - Fantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL2d - Boston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado2d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue4d - Baltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red SoxMore News at Birds Watcher  Former Orioles pitching coach Rick Adair claims that Arrieta was held back because he was recovering from injury, that he had a bone spur in 2011 and he was still getting his feel back. Arrieta doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to buy it, and claims that the coaching staff not only messed him up, but Tillman, Matusz, and Britton too. Tillman has developed into a decent starter for Baltimore, Britton into one of the best closers in baseball, and Matusz has fizzled out into a lefty-specialist, none of them developed into the aces they were supposed to, so it\xe2\x80\x99s only natural to be suspicious. In fact, considering the Orioles haven\xe2\x80\x99t had an ace starter in years (Erik Bedard maybe?), it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly reasonable to be suspicious of the coaching staff.Ultimately, we\xe2\x80\x99ll never truly know why Jake Arrieta couldn\xe2\x80\x99t develop into the ace that he is now while he was in Baltimore. Perhaps it was the coaching, perhaps it was his fault, perhaps it was injury, perhaps it was a mix of everything. But what I do know is that on the day of July 2nd, 2013, I saw that the Orioles had traded Arrieta away and I thought it was perfectly fair, and I still do.It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to hate the trade in retrospect, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to sit there and think back to the Orioles trading away Curt Schilling, Steve Finley, and Pete Harnisch for Glenn Davis and think this is just a repeat, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not. As an Orioles fan, do I get a little twinge every time I see Arrieta pitch? Sure. Does it suck seeing our pitching staff bomb into one of the worst staffs in baseball each year? Sure. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad trade, it\xe2\x80\x99s just baseball.

Mandatory Credit: Peter G. Aiken-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles starting rotation is a work in progress, as it may well be throughout the 2016 season.The big question mark in anticipation of this season surrounded starting pitching, and it continues to be the most uncertain element for this team. Miguel Gonzalez is gone and Kevin Gausman is yet to make his first start. Chris Tillman and Ubaldo Jimenez have been on schedule, but beyond that it has been a rotating rotation. Six different names have started already through the first 17 games.And now the late free agent acquisition, Yovani Gallardo, has been put on the disabled list for 15 days with tendinitis. At the time of his signing, there were a number of question marks both about his health and his declining metrics, particularly velocity.There is quite a chorus among O\xe2\x80\x99s fans and writers of \xe2\x80\x9cI told you so\xe2\x80\x9d comments and reflections on the Gallardo situation. Looking back to the winter signing and my own comments, I can be added to that list. I wrote on February 21 \xe2\x80\xa6I would not have done this deal. As written previously, I fear that this contributes negatively to the overall need for the Orioles to \xe2\x80\x9cgrow the arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Since Gallardo and Ubaldo are too expensive to not use, and Kevin Gausman is going to pitch regularly no matter what, for players like Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson to develop, some terrible things have to happen to Miguel Gonzalez or Chris Tillman.Well, getting released is something terrible, so Gonzo in gonzo. \xc2\xa0And now Tyler Wilson and Mike Wright have had opportunities to start, including the past two games in Kansas City. \xc2\xa0This is a good thing. As we\xe2\x80\x99ve written here multiple times, there is nothing more for these two players to prove at AAA. They need to now show they can do it for the Orioles, and having experiences like this past weekend is what will either affirm or deny their prospective talent.Were they great starts? Not really, but they were not bad at all. Though Wilson gave up three runs in five innings, he gave the Orioles the chance to win, and they did. Wright\xe2\x80\x99s start was actually a quality start, giving up two runs in six innings, before being sent out in the seventh where the game unraveled.It seemed odd that Buck sent Wright out for the seventh inning, having thrown 87 pitches. Presumably it was to save the bullpen. Showalter said ..\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a quality start for us. We had four guys we weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to use in the bullpen today. We needed that from Mike. We just didn\xe2\x80\x99t do much offensively.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles entered the game with the second-most innings pitched by the bullpen amongst American League teams, although the differences are not exceedingly great. As well, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had the second-best ERA at 1.62, just behind the White Sox at 1.60.\xc2\xa0 The third-best is over a run higher at 2.72 by the Mariners.

I have no reason to believe that this is going to be something that\xe2\x80\x99s permanent, however needless to say as of right now he\xe2\x80\x99s a Norfolk Tide. And the fact is that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be an asset to that roster.Courtesy of Mark L. Baer-USA TODAY SportsFlaherty of course was obtained in the 2011-12 Rule 5 draft from the Cubs. While he\xe2\x80\x99s been a utility player ever since, he was an instant fan favorite. He\xe2\x80\x99s only the first in a line of Rule 5 picks that the Orioles have managed to keep and who have produced.Obviously once a player has been on the roster for six months (basically an entire season), he\xe2\x80\x99s officially the property of that team. So unfortunately for Flaherty, this may have boiled down to the fact that he had options available. These decisions sometimes aren\xe2\x80\x99t fair or popular, but the team has to do what serves it\xe2\x80\x99s needs best.

Jones took a big cut at a pitch, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t look comfortable for the rest of the at-bat. MASN cameras caught him talking to the medical staff in the dugout following the at-bat as well.

', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Jake Arrieta and Zach Britton have an answer for why \\u2026', ' Every time that Jake Arrieta does something great for the Cubs, there\'s a new chance for the baseball media world to kick Orioles fans in the teeth. They frequently avail themselves of this opportunity when it presents itself. Arrieta\'s second no-hitter of his career in his most recent start proved to be another one of these opportunities. It surely won\'t be the last chance they get to do so.    Arrieta will forever be the one who got away to O\'s fans. Given the sad state of the Orioles starting rotation over the last couple of seasons and Arrieta\'s wild success in that time, it\'s hard not to look at him and wonder what might have been. Over his past three seasons, he\'s now posted a 1.99 ERA over 62 starts with a 0.898 WHIP. Arrieta threw four complete games last year; the Orioles combined for zero complete games last year. Even when you factor in the National League competition, it\'s nothing short of impressive, and a very long way from the 6.20 ERA he posted in his last full Orioles season. The answer to the cavalry problem The question is there even now: Why couldn\'t the cavalry succeed here? Out of the quartet of Arrieta, Zach Britton, Brian Matusz, and Chris Tillman, the Orioles ended up getting two and a half good seasons of starting pitching - all of those from Tillman. That\'s it.    The answer, or at least an answer, has come into clearer focus with a couple of recent articles. One of them you may have seen is an Arrieta profile from\xc2\xa0Sports Illustrated back in March.    The first paragraph of Tom Verducci\'s article likens Arrieta to quasi-mythical American frontier survivor Hugh Glass. The second paragraph draws a direct parallel between Arrieta and one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from Christian eschatology. In the third paragraph, we are told by Arrieta\'s wife that he is known simply as ""Beast."" Eventually, Verducci starts talking about actual baseball, and a culprit is fingered: former Orioles pitching coach Rick Adair, who served in that position from June 2011 to August 2013 - time in which Arrieta pitched a total of 37 games at the MLB level for the O\'s and pitched to an increasingly worse ERA each season. Regarding that time in his career, Arrieta told Verducci:     There were so many things in Baltimore not many people know about. I had struggles with my pitching coach. A lot of guys did. Three or four guys - Tillman, Matusz, [Zach] Britton - were just really uncomfortable in their own skins at the time, trying to be the guys they weren\'t. You can attest how difficult it is to try to reinvent your mechanics against the best competition in the world.  A lot of Verducci\'s article approaches the topic from what\'s almost an assumption that the Orioles were foolishly mistreating Arrieta all along, and they equally foolishly gave up on him too soon. This is supported here and there by anecdotes from players who faced Arrieta during some of these dark years, players who seemed to see the diamond waiting to be polished. One example is that then-White Sox first baseman Paul Konerko is said to have told Chris Davis of Arrieta in April 2012, ""That\'s the nastiest guy I\'ve seen in the past five years.""    Another comes from then-Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis, who had this to say after facing Arrieta during the 2013 season: ""I remember, in 2013, I faced Matt Harvey, Jose Fernandez and most of the nastiest pitchers you could think of. The guy with the best stuff of all was Jake Arrieta."" Presumably, Konerko made his comment when he faced Arrieta on\xc2\xa0April 29, 2011. Based on that quote, you might expect to look at the box score and find one of those scattered great games that Arrieta could put together to tantalize you about his potential. This is not the case. On that day, Arrieta\'s line was this: 5 IP, 5 H, 3 ER, 2 BB, 2 SO, 1 HR. What about Ellis, who was more impressed by Arrieta than he was by Harvey or Fernandez, the latter of whom won the Rookie of the Year award that season? Again, you\'d think Ellis may have witnessed Arrieta looking like Sandy Koufax returned to the mound. Ellis saw Arrieta on\xc2\xa0April 21, 2013. Ellis was so impressed by a day in which Arrieta pitched this line: 4 IP, 2 H, 5 ER, 5 BB, 6 SO, 1 HBP. Actually, Ellis also saw Arrieta post-Cubs trade in 2013,\xc2\xa0on August 26, 2013, when Arrieta\'s line looked like this: 5 IP, 6 H, 4 ER, 5 BB, 3 SO. Whatever the Cubs did for him, it wasn\'t an instant transformation. These guys saw the same maddening Arrieta with whom Baltimore fans were all too familiar. The annals of baseball are littered with pitchers who have great stuff who can just never harness it.    In and of itself, Arrieta flourishing there after failing here doesn\'t say a whole lot, no matter how impressed Verducci is with Arrieta\'s Pilates workouts. Heck, maybe it was the lack of Pilates that was holding him back all along. Corroboration from a second cavalry member What\'s new after Arrieta\'s recent no-hitter is that a second member of the cavalry has weighed in on Adair\'s tenure with the Orioles. Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports\xc2\xa0published an article on Monday in which he discussed the legendary streak Arrieta\'s fired off over his last 24 regular season starts: a 20-1 record and a 0.86 ERA. That\'s nuts. The interesting thing about this for O\'s fans is that Britton is quoted in the article, discussing that dark period for the cavalry. Speaking critically of what Passan sums up as a cookie-cutter approach, Britton said:  They took away the individual approach to everything. Things we did extremely well in the minor leagues to get to the big leagues - we were told that just doesn\'t work here. And you\'re like, \xe2\x80\x98That\'s kind of weird, right?\' You don\'t just reinvent yourself in the big leagues. That was the struggle. And the struggle, as we got older, was trying to get back to what made us what we were before.  Britton agrees that he, Arrieta, Matusz, and Tillman were all suffering underneath Adair at the time. That\'s pretty serious stuff, and maybe it is a possible explanation for Adair\'s mysterious departure in the middle of the 2013 season, and why Adair has been out of baseball since then. At some point, maybe enough was enough.    These are some fairly savage critiques, or at least they\'re being treated as such by the baseball writers who are making use of these quotes to paint the Orioles as a bunch of blundering dunderheads who ruin every pitcher they come across. Notably, Britton does insist that things are different now with the pitching/bullpen coaching duo of Dave Wallace and Dom Chiti, who publicly espouse different approaches, with individual styles and strengths being emphasized rather than some one-size-fits-all method of trying to assemble pitchers off an assembly line. That\'s a good thing, though Wallace and Chiti\'s success with the 2014 rotation certainly didn\'t carry over all the way to future years. It\'s a little too easy to blame it all on Adair Was it really as bad as all of that under Adair? Perhaps for Britton and Arrieta it truly was. However, being so laser focused on those two guys ignores the fact that the 2012 season was actually pretty good for the O\'s, and a big part of that was the out-of-nowhere contributions of a number of unheralded pitchers. In the bullpen, for instance, a quintet of relievers really flourished, some of them for the first time in their careers. That included the closer, Jim Johnson, a guy who no one really thought about and then suddenly he had 51 saves at year\'s end.    In the rotation, there was Jason Hammel, whom the O\'s were memorably ridiculed by ESPN\'s Keith Law for acquiring. Hammel proved to be a valuable member of the rotation, the only O\'s pitcher to start two games in the ALDS against the Yankees that year.\xc2\xa0Miguel Gonzalez came from the Mexican League to Norfolk and went on to become a solid starter for the team. Even Tillman, who was name-dropped by both Arrieta and Britton as being among the Adair-sufferers, finally found success as a starting pitcher at the MLB level in the second half of that season, success that continued for the next two seasons afterwards. These were things that also happened under the aegis of Adair. The Orioles were able to turn these pitchers, whose pitching arsenals were very diverse, into success stories that season. If Adair was the one great ruiner of pitchers, would any of that still happened? Well, maybe. It could be that all of those gentlemen succeeded in spite of Adair rather than because of him, that they were able to work around Adair where Arrieta, Britton, or Matusz never could. Still, it\'s important to keep in mind that reality is generally more complicated than ready-made narratives make it out to be. Maybe it turns out that the others were just more receptive to Adair\'s message or philosophy. There was definitely something that caused the cavalry to never turn out to be the cavalry. The belief of Arrieta and Britton that Adair was a big factor is significant. They were there. They would know more than me. But not even they know everything - their personal involvement means their recollections aren\'t exactly unbiased.    The O\'s recent track record is not encouraging you to think they\'ve fixed what needed to be fixed. That much is still concerning. Maybe things are getting better and that just hasn\'t had a chance to show itself yet. I won\'t be holding my breath. If we\'re lucky, four years from now we\'ll be reading in Sports Illustrated about how the Orioles were able to nurture Kevin Gausman into a Cy Young-caliber pitcher, rather than reading about how Gausman failed here but blossomed elsewhere. That\'s a topic for another day.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

He came on in the 10th inning of a tied game and gave up an unearned run on a passed ball.\xe2\x80\x9cYou have this 20-year dream of, \xe2\x80\x98Get there, get there, get there, get there,\xe2\x80\x99 and in a split second it changes to, \xe2\x80\x98Stay there, stay there, stay there,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Biagini said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good to at least get one shot in the majors. That\xe2\x80\x99s what this is all about.\xe2\x80\x9dRickard also understands this is a great chance to show his skills at the highest level. His goal is to keep doing that with the Orioles.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great opportunity, and I was excited,\xe2\x80\x9d Rickard said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s some big names here, and it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like learning from them at the same time and showing them you belong.\xe2\x80\x9dSaid Showalter, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not some guy you\xe2\x80\x99re going to knock the bat out of his hand.

What are these national writers seeing that we\'re not seeing? ""Manny Machado the early front runner for AL MVP."" Bleacher Report Power Rankings (9th; LW: 10th)Even Slideshow Central is hopping on the Orioles\' bandwagon. At least this one comes with a note of caution. ""For now they\'ve managed to tiptoe around their pitching issues, and they picked up a nice series win against the Toronto Blue Jays last week to protect their standing atop the division and in the top 10 of these rankings. Their position is a precarious one, though, and sustained success simply isn\'t possible if the rotation continues to be one of the worst in baseball.""    CBS Sports (7th; LW: 3rd)Someone noticed the offense hasn\'t been a powerhouse all season. ""Take an offense heavily reliant on power, combine it with a lackluster starting rotation but an exceptional bullpen and you\'ll get a streaky team. Sure enough, the Orioles won seven straight to open the season and now have dropped four of their last five. It\'s gonna be a hill-and-valley season."" NOTE: These rankings will lag by almost a week due to their publication date. Reddit\'s Power Poll (8th; LW: 8th)""2010 1st round pick Manny Machado had his first hitless game of the season, 2011 1st round pick Dylan Bundy recorded his first major league strikeout, and 2012 1st round pick Kevin Gausman makes his season debut today.

The Baltimore Sun\'s MLB Power Rankings (6th; LW: 4th)It\'s a bad slideshow, and it\'s behind a paywall, but hey, it\'s the hometown paper. The O\'s drop two slots in this week\'s poll. Again.

The Tampa Bay Rays look to move over the .500 mark for the first time this season as they go for a three-game sweep of the visiting Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday night. Kevin Kiermaier has hit safely in seven of the last eight games with three homers, including a two-run blast that snapped a tie in a 3-1 victory Tuesday as the Rays won for the seventh time in 10 contests. Tampa Bay sends Matt Moore to the mound in the finale and Evan Longoria will try to continue his success (seven homers, 51 at-bats) against Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled starter Chris Tillman. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense has cooled off during a three-game slide, managing just two runs combined to allow their lead in the American League East to be reduced to one-half game. Manny Machado is 0-for-11 the last three games after hitting safely in the first 16 contests of the season for Baltimore while slugger Chris Davis is 1-for-12 in the same span. Mark Trumbo is having the best season of any Oriole, working on an 11-game hitting streak and a team-best 17 RBIs. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Chris Tillman (1-1, 4.42 ERA) vs. Rays LH Matt Moore (1-1, 3.60) Tillman comes in off his longest of four outings when he allowed two runs on four hits over six innings in a no decision against division-rival Toronto. The 28-year-old Californian notched his only win by limiting Tampa Bay to one run over five innings on April 8, improving to 6-9 with a 4.19 ERA lifetime against the Rays. Logan Forsythe is 7-for-22 versus Tillman, who has 15 strikeouts over 18 1/3 frames. Moore has given the Rays a chance to win in all four outings, but lost for the first time last Friday after giving up four runs over 6 2/3 innings. The 26-year-old, who has struggled with control at times in the past, boasts 26 strikeouts and just five walks in 25 innings this season. Adam Jones is 11-for-24 with two homers versus Moore, who is 4-4 with a 3.83 ERA in 10 games (nine starts) against Baltimore. WALK-OFFS 1. Baltimore DH Pedro Alavrez is 4-for-6 the last two contests to raise his batting average to .186 and is two hits shy of 600 for his career. 2. Tampa Bay RF Steven Souza Jr. is 8-for-22 during a six-game hitting streak with five RBIs. 3. The Rays have allowed 15 stolen bases in 15 attempts and are the only team not to throw out a runner this season.

It was only the third home run in eight games for the Orioles, who have scored just five runs in their last four games.Tillman (2-1) tied a career high with nine strikeouts.""I wanted to give us a chance to win. We\'ve been great on defense the whole series. One swing today and we came out on top in the game,"" Tillman said.""I was glad he was on my team tonight,"" Rickard said of Tillman. ""That was some impressive stuff. It was almost automatic. When a guy\'s going like that, you\'re very confident on defense and he\'s giving us a chance to get something going.""Darren O\'Day, Brad Brach and Zach Britton finished for Baltimore, with Britton pitching the ninth for his fifth save.Moore (1-2) lost his second straight start after going seven starts without a loss, dating to last season. He gave up three runs and three hits and struck out nine in seven innings.""I actually know (Rickard) decently. We worked out together three or four offseasons,"" said Moore, who spent part of last season with Rickard at Triple-A Durham. ""I pounded Joey (with inside pitches) pretty early in the game and he obviously went in between those at-bats and had a good game plan on pitches inside.""Leadoff singles by Logan Forsythe, Logan Morrison and Evan Longoria were the Rays\' only hits until Steve Pearce drove in a run with a two-out, pinch-hit single in the ninth.The Orioles\' Mark Trumbo went 0 for 3 with a walk, ending his 11-game hitting streak, and Manny Machado went 0 for 4 and is now hitless in his last 17 at-bats.The win was the 1,352nd in the career of Showalter, moving him into a tie with Chuck Tanner for 30th place all-time.MACHADO\'S MISSIONMachado plans to play for the Dominican Republic in next year\'s World Baseball Classic. ""It will be a great time for him,"" Showalter said. ""I\'ll support any of our guys that want to do it. It\'s something that\'s important globally, and our game is very global."" Showalter said ""it would be an honor"" if he is asked in the future to manage in the WBC.AL EAST FEASTWhen their upcoming weekend series against Toronto is completed, the Rays will have played 18 of 24 games against AL East rivals. It will be the Blue Jays\' second visit to Tropicana Field. ""We\'re all being tested early on because of the back and forth, playing each other within the division,"" Rays manager Kevin Cash said.TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: IF-OF Jimmy Paredes (sprained left wrist) went 1 for 4 in his second rehab game and is 1 for 7 overall with Double-A Bowie. He started at third base Tuesday.Rays: Closer Brad Boxberger (adductor surgery) threw fastballs and changeups during a 27-pitch bullpen session. He could start a minor league rehab assignment in the next couple weeks.UP NEXTOrioles: RHP Tyler Wilson (1-0) will get his second start of the season in Thursday\'s opener of a four-game series against the Chicago White Sox in Baltimore.

Pitching carried the Chicago White Sox to the top of the American League Central, but they were unable to contain the big bats of the Baltimore Orioles in the opener of a four-game series. The visiting White Sox, who had their six-game winning streak halted in the 10-2 drubbing, send left-hander Carlos Rodon to the mound Friday night. Orioles third baseman Manny Machado, hitless in his previous four games, broke out of his rut with a grand slam and run-scoring double for a career-high five RBIs. Slugging first baseman Chris Davis ended a 1-for-16 slump with a two-run blast for Baltimore, which had scored a total of five runs in its previous four games. Chicago, which entered the series having allowed an American League-low 53 runs, lost for only the fourth time in 14 games away from home. White Sox closer David Robertson was placed on the bereavement list and will not be available until the series finale. PITCHING MATCHUP: White Sox LH Carlos Rodon (1-2, 4.05 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Mike Wright (1-2, 6.23) Rodon has only one victory despite turning in a quality start in three of his four trips to the mound, settling for a no-decision last time out after striking out seven and permitting two runs over 6 2/3 innings. It was a big bounce-back effort for Rodon, who was shelled for five runs in a career-low one-third of an inning by the Los Angeles Angels in his previous turn. Rodon lost his only start versus Baltimore, giving up four runs over five innings. Wright was en route to his best outing before unraveling late and wound up charged with five runs on eight hits, including a pair of homers, in a 8-1 setback at Kansas City on Sunday. The former East Carolina product also took the loss despite a quality start in his previous turn, giving up three runs over six innings in a 4-3 defeat to Toronto. Wright earned the victory against Chicago his his third career start last year with five innings of three-run ball. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles rookie RF Joey Rickard is batting .472 (17-for-36) at home. 2.

""We\'ve been very good defensively and taking care of the ball, and tonight, for one reason or another, it just wasn\'t that way for us.""Brett Lawrie snapped a 2-for-18 skid and tied the score 3-3 with a solo homer off the Orioles\' Brad Brach in the seventh. Reimold then put the Orioles back in the lead when he hit Carlos Rodon\'s first pitch over the scoreboard in right in the bottom of the inning.""It feels good,"" Reimold said. ""It\'s a good start. It\'s a long year, obviously. I\'ll just try to keep it up and do the little things to keep at it and keep some momentum when I get out there.""Brach (3-0) earned the win in relief of Mike Wright. Zach Britton pitched a perfect ninth to earn his sixth save.Rodon (1-3) gave up six runs and eight hits in seven innings with seven strikeouts.""I felt fine,"" Rodon said. ""I thought I threw well but sometimes things don\'t go your way, and you make a mistake like that late in the game, and you\'re going to pay for it against these big league hitters.""The White Sox took a 1-0 lead in the second on a two-out triple by Avisail Garcia. Rodon retired 11 straight with five strikeouts before allowing a two-out single to Chris Davis.""A bad night with the glove but I thought he threw great,"" Ventura said about Rodon. ""Other than (the seventh) he was spot on. He pitched well. I thought he battled back great. We actually battled back.""However, the two errors helped the Orioles take a 3-1 lead in the fifth.Lawrie couldn\'t handle a sharp grounder by Matt Wieters before a dribbler by Reimold loaded the bases. Jonathan Schoop followed with a two-run single to center. Shortstop Jimmy Rollins then lost his footing on a potential double play, airing his throw to first that allowed Reimold to score.After an RBI single by Jose Abreu pulled the White Sox within a run, Adam Jones preserved the lead by throwing out Rollins, who tried to tag up from third.""If you think you are going to get Adam to back off from playing that way, you are kidding yourself,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.LAWRIE ON A ROLLLawrie has 12 career home runs against the Orioles \xe2\x80\x94 his most against any team.

04/30/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Just Play Nolan Reimold', 'Apr 28, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles left fielder Nolan Reimold (14) catches a fly ball hit by Chicago White Sox right fielder Adam Eaton (not pictured) during the first inning against the Chicago White Sox at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles left fielder Nolan Reimold was the difference-maker with a three-run home run in a 6-3 win over the Chicago White Sox.For quite some time here on The Baltimore Wire we have advocated for Reimold, wondering what there really is to not like about him. And don\xe2\x80\x99t say that it is injuries. That is serious history at this point. Just about every regular on the Orioles has had one or two injuries take them out since the last time Nolan was set aside.Reimold features a high on-base percentage, has speed especially from the plate to first base, provides above average power and defense, and works pitchers into deep counts.Currently he is batting .355 with an OBP of .394.\xc2\xa0 He has three home runs now in 33 plate appearances. Yes, the sample size is small. But consider that even with his career batting average of .252, his on-base percentage is an above average number of .327.The Orioles are 8-1 in games when he has started this year. Again, small sample size. But consider that in the .500 season of 2015 for Baltimore, the O\xe2\x80\x99s were 29-17 in games that Reimold started.At least at this point, the Pedro Alvarez experiment has not been working, though it may yet catch fire. But the Orioles are a better defensive team with Reimold and Rickard in the corner outfield positions, with Mark Trumbo batting and Alvarez watching.Of course, Alvarez as a lefty hitter is supposed to handle right-handed pitchers and keep the Birds from being too heavy on the right side. But Reimold had hit .246/.323 against righties over his career, while Alvarez is .245/.320 \xe2\x80\xa6 thus hardly a difference. Alvarez has the greater power with one home run per 19 at-bats. But Reimold is not even that far off in this regard, with a homer every 24 at-bats right-handed.Now add to this discussion what happens against lefties, and the two players go in opposite directions. Reimold is 14 points better than versus righties, whereas Alvarez drops totally into the basement with a career number of just .202 against left-handed pitching.Again, I ask the question. What is not to like about the current Nolan Reimold?\xc2\xa0 What is wrong with the analysis given here today?

The early leader in the clubhouse for the best bargain of the offseason is Chicago White Sox right-hander Mat Latos, who looks to continue his sensational start when he takes the mound for the third game of a four-game series versus the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday. Latos has allowed a total of two runs in winning his first four starts. A former 14-game winner with both San Diego and Cincinnati, Latos was signed to a one-year, $3 million deal following a pair of injury-plagued campaigns. He will need to be sharp to cool off the Orioles, who have amassed 16 runs in taking the first two games of the series. Nolan Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s tiebreaking three-run homer was the decisive blow in Friday\xe2\x80\x99s 6-3 victory after Baltimore went deep three times in the series opener to snap Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s six-game winning streak. Kevin Gausman will make his second start of the season as the Orioles attempt to hand the White Sox their second three-game losing streak of the season. PITCHING MATCHUP: White Sox RH Mat Latos (4-0, 0.74 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (0-1, 1.80) Latos pitched at least six innings for the fourth time in as many starts last time out, remaining perfect by limiting the Texas Rangers to one run and seven hits. That represented the worst outing by far for Latos, who surrendered a combined six hits in his first three turns and is holding the opposition to a collective .151 batting average. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Pedro Alvarez saw plenty of Latos in the National League, going 8-for-29 with two homers off him. After landing on the disabled due to a bout with tendinitis in his right shoulder, Gausman finally made his season debut at Tampa Bay on Monday. The former No. 4 overall draft pick acquitted himself well in the five-inning stint, striking out seven while permitting one run and three hits in the 2-0 loss. Gausman, who has made two relief appearances against Chicago, has fared well at Camden Yards with a 9-7 record and 3.24 ERA in 29 appearances (21 starts). WALK-OFFS 1. The White Sox can match a franchise record for wins in April (17) with a victory Saturday. 2. Baltimore owns a major league-best 9-1 home record. 3.

Jimenez had walked a tightrope for most of the day, getting out of a bases-loaded situation with nobody out earlier in the game.\xc2\xa0Live Feed j.j. hardyBaltimore Orioles execute a weird triple play on Boston Red Sox FanSidedBaltimore Orioles Clicking on All Cylinders The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado has become an easily disliked figure outside of Birdland The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: How long can one of the best infields in the league stay together? The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Where does shortstop J.J. Hardy rank among AL East peers The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Should there be concern over early injuries? The Baltimore WireOne thing in which the Orioles struggled all series was getting Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Lawrie out \xe2\x80\x93 he hit three home runs against them this weekend. The ChiSox squared up several balls on Jimenez in the fourth inning, however with the exception of Lawrie\xe2\x80\x99s homer (which gave Chicago a 1-0 lead), they all resulted in outs. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t squaring balls up in the fifth inning, yet they produced a big inning. That\xe2\x80\x99s baseball.The Orioles yielded a run on Sanchez\xe2\x80\x99s force out with the bases loaded, and then a second on an RBI-single by Abreu. Cabrera then sent a soft fly ball into left field, which fell for a bloop single \xe2\x80\x93 scoring another run. However Chicago got a bit selfish, trying to send a second runner home. And he was gunned down at the plate.Add in another soft single to center which netted two runs, and Chicago led 6-0. The Orioles would add an RBI-single by\xc2\xa0Nolan Reimold in the last of the sixth, but Chicago also added a sac fly-RBI in the ninth to run the score to 7-1. Again with the exception of the Lawrie homer, Chicago bled and blooped the Orioles to death yesterday. While Jimenez wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really on his game from the beginning, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of those deals where if the outfield is playing just a bit more shallow\xe2\x80\xa6things might have been different.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

He fouled a ball off his foot and it got real stiff and sore quickly, so he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get some more detail. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a scan tomorrow to see the extent of it.That sounds like the thinking in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse is that Hardy could have a broken bone in his foot. That would be something that would undoubtedly end up being a DL situation for the shortstop, who of course is an integral part of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 infield defense. We\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to wait and see.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton injured in lossI would presume that\xc2\xa0Ryan Flaherty would be recalled if Hardy went to the DL, and the Orioles would have the liberty of doing so earlier than the ten days the rules state since it would be the result of an injury. Obviously we don\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure that would be the corresponding move, however that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m predicting. Again luckily for them, today is an of day.

Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY SportsIt is always interesting to take a look at prospects in the Baltimore Orioles system.We are going to make this a monthly post this season, compiling it about the time that the calendar turns over every 30 days. These will be quick summaries, gathering them together for you in one spot. Perhaps of even greater interest is the list at the bottom of those who are playing well but who are not a part of either major Top 30 rankings.This list is primarily from Baseball America\xe2\x80\x99s rankings that occurred in December. The rankings in parentheses are where the player is slotted by MLB.com.\xc2\xa0 Players retaining rookie status and who are with the Orioles currently remain eligible for these listings.1) Dylan Bundy \xe2\x80\x93 RHP \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB #2): Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 Apart from a couple of challenges, this has been a good start for Bundy, pitching some critical innings. In seven games he has compiled nine innings with two earned runs, however with 11 hits and four walks.2) Hunter Harvey \xe2\x80\x93 RHP \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB #1): Unassigned \xe2\x80\x93 Still battling a groin injury with no expectation of a soon return to competitive baseball.3) Chance Sisco \xe2\x80\x93 C \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB #4): Bowie \xe2\x80\x93 In 17 games he is hitting .321 with zero homers. But check out the OBP of .465 on 15 walks, showing good plate discipline.4) Jomar Reyes \xe2\x80\x93 3B \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB #3): Frederick \xe2\x80\x93 At only age 19, he is off to a somewhat slow start with a .224 average in 23 games. He has hit three home runs.5) Mychal Givens \xe2\x80\x93 RHP \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB not ranked): Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 Givens has had some ups and downs with a WHIP of 1.75. But he has a 3.00 ERA and has pitched out of some very difficult situations.6) Chris Lee \xe2\x80\x93 LHP \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB #8): Bowie \xe2\x80\x93 He is off to a great start at 4-0 with a 2.49 ERA in 25.1 innings. His WHIP is 0.908 as he has given up only 16 hits and seven walks. This is why Showalter has been commenting about him at times.7) Ryan Mountcastle \xe2\x80\x93 SS \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB #7): DelMarVa \xe2\x80\x93 Not a good start, he is only hitting .162 in 19 games.8) Trey Mancini \xe2\x80\x93 1B \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB #5): Bowie/Norfolk \xe2\x80\x93 After seven home runs in 17 games at AA, he was moved to AAA where he is 6-for-25 in seven games.9) D.J. Stewart \xe2\x80\x93 OF \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB #6): DelMarVa \xe2\x80\x93 He is only hitting .219, but 16 walks in 83 plate appearances gives him a .398 OBP and raises the thought that perhaps the top draft choice is not seeing much worth hitting.10) Mike Wright \xe2\x80\x93 RHP \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB not ranked): With the Orioles, Wright has pitched well in four starts, better than his 5.40 ERA would lead you to believe. For example, his WHIP is a much better 1.29.11) Tanner Scott \xe2\x80\x93 LHP \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB #9): Scott has a 10.22 ERA in 12.1 innings. With pitches that get to triple digits, he has 15 strikeouts BUT also 16 walks. Control is the problem that must be mastered.12) Jason Garcia \xe2\x80\x93 RHP \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB #10): Bowie \xe2\x80\x93 This has not been the start that Garcia would have liked. He is 1-3 with a 6.86 ERA.\xc2\xa0 All of his numbers look pretty nasty.13) Dariel Alvarez \xe2\x80\x93 OF \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB not ranked): Norfolk \xe2\x80\x93 Though we love his arm, he is not tearing it up at AAA, batting .250 with an OBP of .289.\xc2\xa0 He is yet to hit a homer and has five doubles and five RBIs.14) Christian Walker \xe2\x80\x93 1B,OF \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB #11): Norfolk \xe2\x80\x93 Walker continues to prove he can hit just about anywhere, batting .289 with and OBP of .343.\xc2\xa0 He has four home runs \xe2\x80\x94 the most on the team \xe2\x80\x94 and 15 RBIs. Walker has played all of his 20 games in left field and has one error in 175 innings.15) Jonah Heim \xe2\x80\x93 C \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB #12): A defensive specialist, Heim has hit two home runs this past week and is batting .203.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, due to 10 walks his OBP is .32916) Tim Berry: Waiver claimed by the Marlins in late December17) Ofelky Peralta \xe2\x80\x93 RHP \xe2\x80\x93 (MLB #17): DelMarVa \xe2\x80\x93 In four starts he is 0-1 with a 2.40 ERA.

The sliding New York Yankees look to snap a pair of five-game losing streaks when they begin a three-game series at Baltimore on Tuesday. Although their bats finally broke out after an extended slump, the Yankees fell 8-7 in Boston on Sunday for their fifth consecutive setback, matching their longest skid since a six-game run last May. They enter Camden Yards desperate for a turnaround but also carrying a five-game slide versus the Orioles, who have won 21 of the last 34 meetings overall. \xe2\x80\x9cI think everyone believes in each other in here,\xe2\x80\x9d New York first baseman Mark Teixeira told the New York Daily News after being swept by the Red Sox. \xe2\x80\x9cWe just have to play better. That\xe2\x80\x99s just the way it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s a small sample size right now, but it\xe2\x80\x99s getting bigger.\xe2\x80\x9d One of the many players the Yankees need to turn it around is right-hander Luis Severino, who gave up 32 hits in 19 2/3 innings in April and will oppose Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Tillman in the opener. The Orioles, who dropped a pair of games to the Chicago White Sox over the weekend to fall out of first place in the American League East, placed shortstop J.J. Hardy on the disabled list Monday with a hairline fracture in his left foot that is expected to keep him out of action for at least six weeks. PITCHING MATCHUP: Yankees RH Luis Severino (0-3, 6.86 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Chris Tillman (2-1, 3.24) Severino had seemingly turned a corner with a solid outing in a no-decision against Oakland on April 21, but he was hammered for six runs on seven hits in just three frames at Texas last Tuesday. He has allowed two home runs and walked just three but opponents are hitting a robust .372 against the 22-year-old. Severino faced the Orioles in his final start of the 2015 season, holding them to three runs in a career-high seven innings. Tillman also was roughed up in Texas on April 14 but has bounced back with back-to-back solid starts while allowing two runs in 12 2/3 innings. He struck out a season-high nine and yielded two hits in a win at Tampa Bay on Wednesday, the third straight start in which he has not given up a home run. Yankees designated hitter Alex Rodriguez is 6-for-13 with four home runs against Tillman, who sports a 4.96 ERA in 16 career starts versus New York. WALK-OFFS 1. Rodriguez is 6-for-14 with three home runs in four games since taking two days off to rest a strained side. 2. Orioles 3B Manny Machado has four straight two-hit games. 3. Yankees All-Star RHP Dellin Betances has surrendered a home run in three straight appearances, including two go-ahead blasts against Boston.

Hardy be Missed?', 'Apr 27, 2016; St. Petersburg, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy (2) fields a ground ball during the eighth inning of a baseball game against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field. Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy will be missing for six to eight weeks with a fractured foot due to a foul ball. How much will this hurt the O\xe2\x80\x99s both offensively and defensively?I would submit that the total damage is not as much as is generally thought. Having said that, understand that I believe it would be better if this had never happened. It is just that an honest evaluation puts this in a better perspective than a first glance might indicate.An answer to our primary question will involve who fills the vacancy both in the field and at the plate as a result of the opening in the batting order. And there will certainly not be one person who fills the hole day in and day out. Buck will switch things around with several players and varied matchups \xe2\x80\xa6 as he should.Defensively speaking, there is no scenario we can put together for the Orioles that makes them better without Hardy than with him. Whereas Manny Machado may not be much of a drop-off, and a day may come where he will be better than Hardy with the glove, that probably is not today. And this creates an opening at third base that nobody is going to cover in the same way.Offensively speaking, there may be some scenarios where the team is actually better, especially in terms of power, if not also with other factors like on-base percentage.Ryan Flaherty is being recalled, and playing him at third base with Manny moved to shortstop is the simplest solution. This retains a positive and strong defense with little drop-off in offense and even an increase in power.Though Flaherty is no offensive mega-threat, the fact is that Hardy is no longer terribly scary either. For the 2014-16 seasons, Hardy is hitting .247 with an OBP of a mere .285.\xc2\xa0 There have been 19 home runs, or about one in every 57 plate appearances.Flaherty over the same period has the same OBP and a lower average at .211, but he has 16 home runs in about half as many plate appearances. Flare-dog has been hitting better this year, at least in spring training and in his recent little stint in the minors (8-for-19).The Orioles have had an extra pitcher and playing short on the bench, so bringing up an additional infielder like Paul Janish is possible. He is an outstanding defensive player \xe2\x80\x94 nearly as capable as Hardy \xe2\x80\x94 and though never known for much production, he has been hitting exceptionally well at Norfolk. Right now he is batting .318, and he did hit .286 in 14 games with the Orioles last year. The O\xe2\x80\x99s have held onto Janish for just such a time as this, knowing that Hardy has been a bit fragile in recent years.I believe there is a better solution than these above, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will happen. This suggestion is not as strong defensively, but it would make the lineup definitively better. Put Chris Davis at third base, Mark Trumbo at first base, Nolan Reimold in the outfield, and Pedro Alvarez at designated hitter.If it seems crazy to have Davis at third base, that may be because of a short memory. When the Orioles first had Chris Davis from Texas, he was more of a third baseman than first baseman. He has played a total of 89 career games at the hot corner. There were concerns before the 2012 season as to whether Davis could make the transition to first base. The big guy is a great athlete and could do a commendable job at third.

But neither is he overly lucky about staying on the field. And I feel badly for him to as to how much this hurts, remembering college baseball and thinking there was nothing in the world quite so painful as a foul ball off the foot.

It was also his longest outing of the year.  Trumbo homered in the second and fifth innings and leads Baltimore with eight. Brad Brach pitched a scoreless eighth and Darren O\'Day retired the side in the ninth to pick up his second save with closer Zach Britton on the DL.  The Yankees\' Luis Severino (0-4) is now winless in five starts. He gave up four runs on five hits with four strikeouts and two walks over six innings. His ERA is 6.31 over 25 2/3 innings. New York\'s Alex Rodriguez  the designated hitter  left the game after he grabbed at his hamstring running out a grounder in the fifth. Dustin Ackley took over for Rodriguez and singled to left in the eighth.  Brian McCann walked and Carlos Beltran singled to open the second against Tillman. After Starlin Castro grounded into a double play  Didi Gregorius singled up the middle for a 1-0 lead.  The Orioles tied the score in the bottom half when Trumbo crushed Severino\'s 95 mph fastball into the left-field bleachers. Baltimore took 2-1 lead in the fourth when Severino dropped first baseman Mark Teixeira\'s throw on a grounder by Ryan Flaherty that allowed Jonathan Schoop to score from second.  Trumbo delivered again in the fifth with another towering two-run shot to left off Severino. NOTES: Orioles SS J.J. Hardy was placed on the disabled list with a fracture in his left foot. He could be out six to eight weeks  but the exact timeline is still uncertain. ""I\'ve never broken a bone in my body until this  so I don\'t know how long it\'s going to take "" Hardy said. ... Yankees LHP Aroldis Chapman  who was suspended for violating Major League Baseball\'s domestic abuse policy  is scheduled to pitch in an extended spring game on Wednesday. Chapman can return to the team on May 9 when his 30-game suspension ends. ... Baltimore RHP Zach Britton had an MRI on his sprained left ankle that found no additional damage. That means Britton could be available at some point during the three-game series with the Yankees. ', 'www.usatoday.com')]"

In the fifth inning, Alex Rodriguez left clutching his hamstring after running out a ground ball. He will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging exam Wednesday morning to determine the extent of the injury.\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how bad it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s definitely worrisome. He just started swinging the bat, too.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      That tone of weariness is becoming a familiar one for the Yankees, who once again struggled to do anything more at the plate than hit singles \xe2\x80\x94 or string many of them together. It was the 13th time in 24 games that they have not managed more than two runs.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Luis Severino turned in his best start of the season, but his few mistakes were too much to overcome. He allowed two home runs to Mark Trumbo and dropped two soft tosses from Mark Teixeira while covering first base, the second of which allowed another run to score.As he walked back to the mound after the second drop, Severino was patted on the back by Teixeira, a gesture of support and encouragement that the Yankees are finding themselves increasingly needing as they sit in last place in the American League East at 8-16. The last time they were this many games below .500 was in 2007, when they started the season 21-29.Before the game, General Manager Brian Cashman tried to direct some of the heat away from his players, coaches and Girardi by accepting blame for the poor start and reiterating that no changes were afoot \xe2\x80\x94 for the moment.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cThe reality is, the talent level that we currently have in that clubhouse is good enough to be a force,\xe2\x80\x9d Cashman said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be thinking this way. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sitting in front of you right now having to talk about such an awful April.

It does you no good. I think the players are frustrated. I think they come prepared every day and they expect good things to happen, and right now they\xe2\x80\x99re not happening. But that will turn around.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Yankees trotted out their usual lineup and looked little different from the way they have all season. The seven runs they posted Sunday night in an 8-7 loss at Boston looked like an aberration as the night wore on.

A potentially robust inning had been undercut one batter earlier, when Starlin Castro grounded into a double play.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees put runners on in each of the first six innings, but every half-threat petered out. The only extra-base hit was Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s double off the right-field wall in the first. And a promising start to the sixth, in which Teixeira walked and McCann blooped a single to left, soon fizzled. Carlos Beltran lined out to right, and Castro lined into a double play when McCann was caught off first.The Yankees struck out nine times against Chris Tillman, who matched his career high. He had entered the game with a 4.96 E.R.A. against the Yankees.

It was not clear how long he would be out. He missed two games last week when he tweaked an oblique muscle.\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a big pop,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodriguez said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done that before in my career. I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping for the best. Hopefully, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a small setback.\xe2\x80\x9dBut it could be another one that the Yankees find difficult to absorb.

New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez told his teammates prior to Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s matchup in Baltimore that there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason they can\xe2\x80\x99t score five runs per game. It took one night for Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s words to take hold with the Yankees, who hope to carry the offensive momentum into Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s series finale against the host Orioles. Although Rodriguez was placed on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday, New York snapped a six-game losing streak with a 7-0 drubbing that night for just its fifth victory in its last 20 games at Camden Yards. Leadoff batter Jacoby Ellsbury recorded three hits and reached base in all five plate appearances while Brian McCann drove in three runs to break an eight-game RBI drought for the Yankees, who will be wrapping up a nine-game road trip. Even though Baltimore has dropped three of four, the move from third base to shortstop hasn\xe2\x80\x99t affected Manny Machado, who has registered three doubles in seven at-bats in the series. Orioles right-hander Kevin Gausman will oppose New York ace Masahiro Tanaka in Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s rubber match. PITCHING MATCHUP: Yankees RH Masahiro Tanaka (1-0, 2.87 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (0-1, 2.45) Tanaka sailed through six scoreless innings at Boston on Sunday but wound up being charged with two runs and six hits over 6 2/3 frames in his fourth no-decision. It was the third consecutive start of at least six innings for the Japanese standout, who has recorded 18 strikeouts versus one walk over 20 2/3 frames in that span. Tanaka is 1-1 with a 3.03 ERA in four career starts against the Orioles but has served up six homers in 29 2/3 innings. A meltdown by Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen wiped out Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s chance for a victory after he gave up three runs (two earned) in six innings against the Chicago White Sox on Saturday. It was only the second start of the year for Gausman, who yielded one run and three hits over five frames in his season debut versus Tampa Bay following a case of tendinitis in his right shoulder. Gausman is 3-2 with a 2.79 ERA in 11 career appearances (five starts) versus the Yankees. WALK-OFFS 1. New York has scored a total of 15 runs in Tanaka\xe2\x80\x99s five starts. 2. Orioles closer Zach Britton, who sprained his ankle on Saturday, is expected to throw another bullpen session Thursday. 3. The Yankees recalled LHP James Pazos from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to take Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s roster spot. PREDICTION: Yankees 5, Orioles 3  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), (""Orioles walk off in 10th after Gausman's eight shutout ..."", ' The Orioles and Yankees engaged in a true pitchers\' duel tonight as Kevin Gausman and Masahiro Tanaka matched each other pitch for pitch through eight scoreless innings of baseball. It wasn\'t until the tenth inning that the O\'s bats finally broke through, and the game winning RBI came from a very unlikely source.    With Hyun Soo Kim at third base (he reached base twice tonight) and no outs, Buck Showalter sent in Nolan Reimold to pinch run as the Yankees\' interim manager (Joe Girardi was tossed for being a crybaby earlier) called for Andrew Miller from the bullpen. The peanut gallery gasped, ""What is Buck doing!?"" Sending a sold right-handed option to pinch run while allowing Pedro Alvarez to face Andrew Miller seemed insane. As we all prepared for the strike out, Alvarez surprised us. Instead he sent a fly ball to medium center field. Reimold raced home head of the throw to score the winning run as Alvarez was mobbed at first. Great win! Gausman\'s Great Game Kevin Gausman was masterful tonight. He didn\'t strike the world out, recording just four over his eight innings of work, but the Yankees could not figure him out. He gave up only three hits and didn\'t walk a batter. It was a lot of fun to watch.    After retiring the first six batters he faced, Gausman gave up his first hit of the day on a ground ball off the bat of Aaron Hicks. It went up the middle and second baseman Jonathan Schoop ranged to the middle and was almost able to make a play. The next batter, Didi Gregorious, perhaps knowing how few chances they\'d have against Gausman on the night, bunted on the first pitch. It went right back to Gausman, who threw out the runner at second, and then got the next two batters.    The only extra-base hit of the night came in the fourth inning when Starlin Castro doubled down the left field line. Castro moved to third on a fly ball to Adam Jones. Jones looked like he had a chance to get Castro at third but the throw was off line. Gausman didn\'t need the help, though. Neither Mark Teixeira nor Carlos Beltran could bring the runner in from third. Teixeira\'s ground out kicked off a run of nine outs in a row by Gausman. It wasn\'t until Teixeira came up again in the seventh inning that another Yankee reached base. Teixeira singled to center field with one out and was promptly erased on an inning-ending double play.    Goose mowed \'em down 1-2-3 for his eighth and final innings. He finished his night with 97 pitches and a pitching line of 8 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 4 K. What a night. O\'s Tank Against Tanaka Unfortunately for Gausman, the rest of the Orioles, and the Orioles fans, Masahiro Tanaka was just about as good as Gausman. He\'s been the Yankees best pitcher this year and it showed tonight. The Orioles did have a few chances that they coudln\'t capitalize on. In the third inning, Ryan Flaherty and Adam Jones singled to put runners on the corners with two outs, but the slumping Chris Davis grounded out. They put two more runners on base in the fourth thanks to Matt Wieters\'s second single of the game and a walk from Hyun Soo Kim, but Jonathan Schoop frustratingly grounded into an inning ending double play on the first pitch.    After that Tanaka completely shut the O\'s down, retiring 12 of the final 13 batters he faced. He exited the game with the score tied 0-0 and turned things over to the Yankees bullpen. Orioles Prevail in Bullpen Battle Darren O\'Day and Zach Britton pitched for the O\'s out of the bullpen today and they weren\'t as dominating as we\'d like to see. O\'Day got two outs in the ninth but gave up a two-out single to Castro. With Brian McCann coming to the plate and O\'Day being kind of shaky against lefties this year, Buck Showalter went to Zach Britton. It was Britton\'s first game since twisting his ankle last Saturday, and he was clearly rusty. He went to a full count on McCann and allowed Castro to get to second on a wild pitch, but then Wieters caught Castro wandering off of second and picked him off to end the inning. It looked like the O\'s might win the thing in the ninth inning, but the combination of a great catch by Dustin Ackley and a TOOTBLAN from Joey Rickard ruined that dream. Against Dellin Betances, Mark Trumbo worked a one-out walk and was replaced by Rickard as a pinch hitter. Matt Wieters hit a long fly ball to right field that looked like it had a chance to get out of the park. Instead Ackely made a great catch up against the right field wall. Rickard seemed to think that the ball hit off the wall and just stood on second base looking confused as he was easily doubled up. Argh!    Britton continued to look rusty in the 10th as he walked leadoff batter McCann. Just as I started to get worried, Britton turned the corner. He struck out Teixeira, Beltran, and Ackely swining to get out of the inning. After using Betances for the ninth inning, the Yankees had both Andrew Miller and Johnny Barbato warming in the bullpen. I don\'t know much about Barbato, but I knew I\'d rather the Orioles faced him instead of Miller. It was Barbato who came in for the 10th. Yes! The first batter he faced was Kim, who hit a high Baltimore Chop in the infield. He hustled to first ahead of the throw to get on base as the winning run. Next up was Jonathan Schoop, who lined a ball to left-center field for a single. Kim continued to hustle and made it all the way to third base. That set the stage for the Alvarez vs. Miller showdown. Here are the facts: Alvarez is terrible against lefties. Andrew Miller is one of the finest lefties in the game. So far this year Alvarez hasn\'t played in any games with an lefty was starting, and has gone 1-for-9 against them this season. Miller had faced 8 lefties this year with one hit and five strikeouts. What I\'m saying is that the odds weren\'t good. Well you know what we say about that: Never tell me the odds. Alvarez didn\'t strike out. He sent a fly ball to the outfield, which was all he needed to do. The Orioles walked off against Andrew Miller and that\'s pretty satisfying.

You\xe2\x80\x99re going to have courses through the season where you play bad baseball. It just so happens that ours is April, and it\xe2\x80\x99s magnified. We still have a long time to get this turned around, and that\xe2\x80\x99s got to be our mind-set in here. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got five months to continue to climb up the standings, and that\xe2\x80\x99s just the reality to it.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The Yankees took at least one step in the proper direction later Wednesday, getting a turn-back-the-clock performance from C. C. Sabathia and three R.B.I. from McCann to break open a tight game and beat the Baltimore Orioles, 7-0. The victory ended a six-game losing streak that had, at times, seemed more like 60.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cWe felt like we clinched a playoff berth,\xe2\x80\x9d left fielder Brett Gardner said.Nobody was more responsible for ending the skid than Sabathia, whose previous trip here had ended with his walking into Manager Joe Girardi\xe2\x80\x99s office last October and leaving the team to check into an alcohol rehabilitation clinic. Sabathia, who had done little so far this season to engender much confidence that he could be more than a passable fifth starter, threw seven shutout innings \xe2\x80\x94 the first time he had done that since April 7, 2013.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a big contrast from me standing in this locker room the last time,\xe2\x80\x9d Sabathia said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be able to go out and get us a win felt great.\xe2\x80\x9dSabathia, who allowed six hits and two walks and struck out six, used his cut fastball and his fading changeup to work both sides of the plate. He also mixed in his slider and his two-seam fastball. His pinpoint control left the Orioles so off balance that when he worked up in the zone with his marginal fastball, he was able to sneak it by, as he did in striking out Joey Rickard and Manny Machado.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Sabathia induced three inning-ending double plays and escaped a first-and-third, one-out fix in the fifth by striking out Rickard with a letter-high 87-mile-per-hour fastball before retiring Machado on a liner to center field.

He descended the dugout steps into a swarm of teammates offering high-fives.Sabathia was not the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 only encouraging performer. Jacoby Ellsbury reached base five times, one of them on a single that began the three-run rally in the sixth that broke a scoreless tie. McCann contributed with a run-scoring single in that inning and a two-run double in the eighth, when the Yankees put the game out of reach.Carlos Beltran started the four-run rally in that inning with a ringing double.It was a bounty of riches of a kind rarely enjoyed this season by the Yankees, who had been held to two runs or fewer in 13 of their first 24 games. The only real cause for concern at the end of the night was the condition of Gardner, who took a bases-loaded fastball from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Dylan Bundy on his right elbow in the eighth. It was a painful way to drive in a run.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Gardner left the game in the ninth. Although X-rays were negative, it seemed unlikely that he would play Thursday when the Yankees finish their road trip.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  On Wednesday, Beltran replaced Rodriguez as the designated hitter, a role that Girardi said would also fall to Teixeira and McCann.The decision to replace Rodriguez on the roster with reliever James Pazos raised eyebrows, but Girardi said it was in deference to the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 schedule. On Tuesday, they began a stretch in which they play 20 games in 20 days, and Girardi emphasized that they might not carry 13 pitchers through that entire stretch.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Also to be determined is the extent of Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s injury. Although a magnetic resonance imaging exam Wednesday morning revealed a strained right hamstring, Rodriguez had not yet been examined by the team doctor, so little was known except that he will spend at least 15 days on the disabled list.Rodriguez, 40, said it was important to let a hamstring injury heal because rushing back could lead to a more serious setback. He missed 13 games with a hamstring injury in 1996, when he was 20.\xe2\x80\x9cI felt pretty good coming in, but the machine doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lie,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodriguez said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be smart; there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of baseball to be played this year.\xe2\x80\x9d  A version of this article appears in print on May 5, 2016, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Yanks\xe2\x80\x99 Blazing Bats Punctuate Sabathia\xe2\x80\x99s Shutout .

Until the 10th, the Yankees put runners in scoring position just twice \xe2\x80\x94 each time leaving Starlin Castro with regrets and anger.Castro was picked off second with two outs in the ninth, getting caught by catcher Matt Wieters when Brian McCann swung through a 3-1 pitch. If that irked Girardi, he was infuriated earlier when the third-base umpire, Chris Guccione, refused to call Gausman for a balk for not coming to a stop in the set position when Castro, who had doubled, had reached third with two out.

Miller, who had pitched just twice in the previous nine days, said he was well rested and could have pitched two innings.

In each of his previous five starts he gave up two earned runs. But on this night he would go eight full innings without yielding anything but five hits and a walk.As good as that was, Gausman was better. He too went eight shutout frames, giving up just three hits and zero walks. He has now yielded only three runs on 10 hits in 19 innings this season. That is a WHIP of 0.68.Could this finally be the arrival of the Gausman that has been hoped for over the past four years? There have been flashes of it from time to time, games where he is rather unhittable. But the consistency has been absent. Right now he is 14-20 for his career. After all of the shoulder problems, he finally looks healthy and ready to be the guy the Orioles invested in.Another arm that looked just fine on Thursday night was that of Matt Wieters. His throw to pick off a runner at second base with two outs in the top of the 9th inning was as good as you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever see from a catcher. After the Tommy John surgery and long-term recovery, this is gratifying to see.The third arm that is just fine on the Orioles is that of Zach Britton. Actually, it was his ankle that was the recent problem and setback. And Zach did not look good for his first couple of batters. He threw a wild pitch in the 9th inning and walked the leadoff man in the 10th.\xc2\xa0 The O\xe2\x80\x99s closer was simply out of rhythm.

05/09/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Trending in the Right Direction', 'After the first 30 games of the 2016 season for the Baltimore Orioles, there are many trends that may be noted to be headed in the right direction.After destroying the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s on Sunday with 11 runs powered by six homers, the O\xe2\x80\x99s sit at 18-12, a perfect 60% winning percentage. That would translate to a 97-win season.The team has displayed many of the features anticipated: a powerful long-ball lineup that can be shut down by excellent pitching, a top-notch bullpen, and an inconsistent starting rotation. Whereas the strengths are being largely utilized, the weaknesses are along trending in a healthier direction.After a mild fumble by Mike Wright in the doubleheader opener on Saturday, the veterans Ubaldo Jimenez and Chris Tillman came back with quality starts. They gave up only a total of five runs in 14.1 innings.Manny Machado is simply now one of the elite stars of the sport, becoming one of those players where fans of other teams are personally interested in seeing play. Machado\xe2\x80\x99s six RBIs on two homers gives him 22 for the season on nine home runs. This is a pace to hit 49 round-trippers with 119 runs batted in.Chris Davis and Adam Jones, though productive in varied ways and at varied times, are both only hitting .200 at this point. You know they are going to pick it up and hit at a better average than this, and when they do, what might the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup produce at that point?Perhaps Davis and Jones can follow in the path of Jonathan Schoop. After getting off to a somewhat slow start in the first 19 games and batting .200, he has an 11-game hitting streak wherein he is 14-for-40 (.350) to raise his average to .257.Chris Tillman on Sunday continued another trend we have seen in 2016. After his almost obligatory difficult first inning, he found the feel for his off-speed pitches as the game went along. When he throws them for strikes, he becomes nearly unhittable. Tillman was not sharp throughout the game, but when he found the curve in the sixth inning, he set down three hitters on strikeouts on just 10 pitches. His ERA is now at 3.05.

05/10/2016,"[('Who has been the most disappointing Oriole so far ...', ' The Baltimore Orioles have played, for the most part, good baseball in the early part of the 2016 season. Considering how many question marks there were in the offseason, the team\'s performance has been rather surprising. The rotation is actually good. Mark Trumbo has been a revelation at the plate. And many of the expected positives, like a strong bullpen and tons of dongs, have come through. That said, don\'t kid yourself. Some Birds have been bad. Like, really, really bad. But who has been the worst?    Crush crashing Don\'t get this wrong, Chris Davis has been a bright spot for the Orioles. He leads the team in walks, has hit eight home runs; each one more majestic than the last, and, even though advanced metrics paint him as an average defender at first base, his ability to pick throws out of the dirt has proved invaluable to his fellow infielders. But he signed a seven-year, $161 million with the expectation that he would still be one of the best power hitters in baseball for the next two seasons, at least. So far, he\'s not doing that. His .436 slugging percentage is sixth on the team behind guys like Jonathan Schoop and Nolan Reimold. And, while Davis is not expected to compete for batting titles, hitting .200 won\'t cut it. My gut tells me he will turn it around, but early signs have him looking more like 2014 Crush rather than the 2015 version. DFA him already There has to be another LOOGY on the free agent market that is better than Brian Matusz. Even lefties are hitting .250 against him and they are getting on base at a .625 clip. Righties are slashing .455/.462/.727 with a home run over 13 plate appearances.    This comes a season after he was, arguably, at his best. In 2015, he turned in an ERA of 2.94, a career low, and an ERA+ of 140, a career high. Something must be wrong now, right? He was even worse with Bowie in rehab outings in April before returning to the bigs a few weeks ago. Based on the fact that Norfolk currently has six southpaws on their roster, Matusz needs to pick it up immediately, or he will be out of a job.    Slow starter The mid-March signing of Pedro Alvarez left some scratching their heads. Sure, the Orioles could have used another left-handed bat, but they needed that same guy to be able to play right field. Alvarez can barely hold it down at first base let alone track a fly ball. BUT HE HITS DONGS! Yeah, except he hasn\'t done much of that. As the team\'s primary designated hitter, the slugger is slashing .206/.320/.381 with two home runs, five doubles and seven RBI. However, his 11 walks are the second-most on the team. He is taking ball four 14.7 percent of the time, the best mark of his career. And he is striking out just 20 percent of the time, the lowest rate of his career. Plus, he is notoriously bad in March and April, hitting .197 in those months as a major leaguer. There is hope for him still.    Qualifying offer craziness What can $15.8 million buy you? Apparently, not a very good catcher. That is Matt Wieters\' salary this season, and it looks as though it may be a huge waste of money. Over 20 games, he is slashing .211/.282/.282 with one home run, two doubles, eight RBI, seven walks and 22 strike outs. And he has caught on back-to-back days only twice so far. In the field, he is throwing out 50 percent of base stealers (3-for-6) and his catcher\'s ERA (whatever that\'s worth) is a nice 3.35. Meanwhile, his back-up, Caleb Joseph has had equal struggles with the bat (.205/.295/.231), has only tossed out 4 of 17 would-be base stealers, and has a CERA of 4.13. So, there is no real pressure for Wieters to not be the first choice behind the plate. But Joseph also makes just north of $500,000 per year, not $15.8 million. So, the two should not have similar-looking batting lines. Especially when manager Buck Showalter insists on batting Wieters fifth or sixth, a fringe RBI spot. His 28.2 percent strikeout rate is ridiculously high for a guy with one round-tripper. Move down the lineup, Wiety.    Worth a draft pick? All the buzz words were there. ""Veteran arm"". ""Reliable veteran"". ""Steady production"". They never mentioned the mid-80s fastball when Yovani Gallardo signed on for two years and $22 million at the end of February. After four starts, the right-hander found himself on the disabled list with shoulder tendinitis, a 7.00 ERA and a .319 opponent\'s batting average. The 30-year-old\'s strikeout rate continued its downward trend. At the time of his injury, he was getting strike three just 4.50 times per nine innings pitched. This is a guy that, at the height of his career, was sitting nearly 10 guys down in that same time frame. According to Fangraphs, his fastball was averaging 87.2 mph before he got hurt. 87 MPH? For a right-hander? In his age 30 season? What the what? To his credit, opposing hitters have a .333 batting average on balls in play. That will drop. And his current 3.8 percent fly ball is incredibly low, so that means he wouldn\'t give up too many long balls. But the Orioles knocked a year off the original deal between the player and the club because of something their doctors saw. And now, Gallardo is out with a problem that he admitted he had never felt before. That sounds ominous. The former all-star will begin throwing on Saturday and, even though the rotation has done a nice job so far, an upgrade over Mike Wright would be a boost. Maybe his ""rib area"" is still bothering him If he\'s not hurt, then Adam Jones is just really awful this year. But let\'s get real, Jones is still probably dealing with a problem in his rib area, which goes back to the season\'s first week. It\'s commendable how dedicated he is to his craft and that he feels as though he does need to earn his paycheck, but the center fielder is becoming a burden to have in the lineup every single day. He has a slash line of .200/.269/.274 with one home run, four doubles and nine RBI and is still being allowed to hit in the middle of the order. This has him perfectly positioned to be a rally killer. The eight double plays he has hit into are tied for the most in baseball.\xc2\xa0He can\'t even hit against pitchers that aren\'t pitchers.    Fangraphs gives him a WAR of -0.5. Baseball Reference is even harsher with a -1.0 WAR. Both values are the worst on the Orioles. Even fielding has been a struggle. Jones has just one assist so far. And his current UZR/150 of -9.0 would be his worst value since 2007, when he was a 21-year-old with the Mariners. For all of those reasons, Jonesy has been the most disappointing Oriole of 2016, but I have faith that he can turn it around...eventually.

That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like the Adam Jones Baltimore is used to, so naturally the question that comes up is, should we be worried?In my preseason projections, I mentioned that Adam Jones is a bit of an oddity. He swings at everything, has a terrible OBP, and yet somehow keeps hitting the ball. I also mentioned that, because of that style of hitting, Jones is ripe for a massive crash one year.So have we hit that year? Jones has no power so far, and he just can\xe2\x80\x99t get on base. So what\xe2\x80\x99s going on? Is this the year he crashes? Is it time to panic? Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the statistics.oriolesCall to the Pen 2dCurt Schilling Continues to be an EmbarrassmentMore headlines around FanSided:2d - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday2d - Fantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL2d - Boston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado2d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue4d - Baltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red SoxMore News at Birds Watcher  First off, I should mention that we know Jones was hurt, and he was hurt for a while. For whatever reason, the Orioles in their infinite wisdom decided against putting him on the DL, something that major league baseball teams do that bothers me to no end. I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather a player be out for 15 days and just get healthy than to sit in the injury purgatory known as \xe2\x80\x9cday-to-day\xe2\x80\x9d.It\xe2\x80\x99s more than likely that Jones\xe2\x80\x99 injury has affected his hitting to an extent, but even when we look at the stats, things actually look ok. Jones has unfortunately been the victim of some bad luck.First of all, his BABIP is at .240, which is very low for him (his career BABIP is .310). Also, his HR/FB rate is insanely low, all the way down at 4%. The league average is generally around 10% and Jones\xe2\x80\x99 career average is 15.2%. Now, if he were hitting less fly balls, or hitting the ball softer, this would make sense, but he isn\xe2\x80\x99t. His fly ball rate is about where it always is, and his hard hit rate is about a percentage point higher than his career rate. So he\xe2\x80\x99s still hitting fly balls, and he\xe2\x80\x99s still hitting them hard, he\xe2\x80\x99s just not getting them out of the park yet.One thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ve found exceptionally interesting is that his walk rate is actually above average (for him) this year. Typically, Jones has a walk rate around 4%, but so far this year, he\xe2\x80\x99s at 7.7%, which is, sadly, the best he\xe2\x80\x99s had in his entire career.So in summary, Adam Jones is hitting the ball just as much as he usually does, just as hard as he usually does, and is actually showing a bit more patience at the plate than normal. He\xe2\x80\x99s just getting very unlucky with where the ball is falling, his low BABIP and HR/FB rate are huge testaments to that.So is it time to panic about Adam Jones? Not at all, things will absolutely get better. He\xe2\x80\x99ll probably hit about .270 from this point on, with another 20-23 home runs, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll all see the Adam Jones we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten used to here in Baltimore.

Baltimore Orioles defeated New York Yankees 4-1. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsA major question in the recent offseason was what the Baltimore Orioles were going to do about the corner outfield positions.There appeared to be a major curse upon the team for not re-signing Nelson Cruz and Nick Markakis as free agents after the 2014 season. It seemed that every option attempted at answers in 2015 was insufficient; and along with the problems associated with the starting rotation, it doomed the Birds to a mediocre 81-81 season.In 2015, the combined stats for left fielders included a batting average of just .210, better than only one other American League team (Oakland). While balanced out a bit by hitting 18 home runs, even that was merely the league average.The right field situation was in reality surprisingly better than memory would anticipate. Orioles right fielders combined for a .275 average (4th in the AL) and 24 home runs (good for 7th).\xc2\xa0 Some of these numbers were helped by Chris Davis playing 30 games out there.Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at DH numbers also in this comparative discussion, since outfielders often are the primary designated hitters on an American League team. In 2015, total stats for O\xe2\x80\x99s DHs were .253 with 11 home runs, good for 7th and 11th in the AL respectively.Much fretting over the offseason surrounded these corner outfield positions. Though Mark Trumbo was secured early, it was not known if he would end up as the first baseman in the event of a non-signing by Davis. There were worries about not having a left-handed bat, and would Nolan Reimold be a workable solution? Should the O\xe2\x80\x99s have more aggressively sought to sign someone as Cespedes? How would Hyun Soo Kim transition from Korea?Instead, as spring rolled around, it was looking like a Rule 5 draftee named Joey Rickard might have to carry a lot of weight in the corner outfield \xe2\x80\xa6 which he has.So where do the Orioles rank among AL teams in reference to RF, LF and DH?For left field, the Orioles have the best number in the American League at .333 with an OBP of .379.\xc2\xa0 There are only four home runs and 13 RBIs, though Rickard has accounted for many of these numbers in the leadoff position.In right field, a .336 average and .384 OBP has the O\xe2\x80\x99s as the number one team in each category in the American League. They also have the best slugging and OPS rankings. Trumbo has been very, very good.

Mandatory Credit: Peter G. Aiken-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles took apart the Minnesota Twins 9-2 by hitting four home runs from their three biggest bats.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are paying a bunch of the boys to hit home runs, and the team got plenty of bang for the buck on Wednesday afternoon. In a place not known for homers, Mark Trumbo hit a pair of them with Chris Davis and Adam Jones adding one each. Davis just barely missed another, getting an RBI double instead.We say these are the three biggest bats, and they probably are the first three players expected to hit homers. If you take a 162-game average for each, Davis hits 37, Trumbo 31 and Jones 25. But there are others who are growing into similar power hitters, having had shorter careers and total games played. Manny Machado is now at 26 per 162 games (and growing), with Pedro Alvarez at 28. Beyond this also is Jonathan Schoop with 23 \xe2\x80\xa6 a number that will expand as well.The Baltimore Orioles team on display in Minnesota on Wednesday is the one envisioned and hoped for in 2016. There is the obvious power with the four home runs. As expected also is the bullpen that comes on with a lead and eliminates any additional scoring by the opponent. And hoped for was sufficient rotation pitching, particularly from newer and younger starters. Tyler Wilson provided the final element with seven innings of two-run ball, lowering his ERA to 2.94.The O\xe2\x80\x99s starters have had a rather solid streak of games. It is not record-setting, but it is very solid. Seven of the last eight games have been quality starts, with only Mike Wright\xe2\x80\x99s last game not qualifying. But even that was a game with few hard-hit balls. At this point, the starters beyond Wilson have these ERA statistics: Gausman \xe2\x80\x93 2.16 / Tillman 3.05 / Jimenez \xe2\x80\x93 4.54 / Wright \xe2\x80\x93 5.83.\xc2\xa0 The trend is a good one.The Orioles did more than just hit home runs on Wednesday afternoon in Minnesota when beating the Twins and the threatening weather. They pounded out 16 total hits, the best number of the season. Half of these were by Jones and Davis, each going 4-for-5.\xc2\xa0 In doing so, Jones saw his average raise from .210 to .238, and Davis went from .217 to .242. Knowing the way both players are able to carry a team, if they get hot, it could be very interesting to see what kind of scoring the Orioles can post.

Tuesday night against the Minnesota Twins, that hard work paid off. Jones had a pair of hits, including a two-run single in the top of the ninth inning to break a tie game as the Orioles won 5-3 at Target Field. Baltimore has won three straight games and sits tied atop the American League East with the Boston Red Sox. Minnesota has lost six straight games and 10 of its past 11 overall. Jones entered the game hitting .200 with one home run and nine RBIs in the first 26 games of the season. After getting rained out on Monday, Jones spent extra time in the hitting cages to try and get things right. The early returns are promising: He matched the homer total and equaled one-third of his previous RBIs on Tuesday, getting a pair of hits in five trips to the plate. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to be as good as he\xe2\x80\x99s capable of,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a feel-good because you know how much it (bothers him). He\xe2\x80\x99s got a great way of not taking himself too seriously but you know it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of been grinding on him. You know he cares.\xe2\x80\x9d With the game tied at 3-3 in the ninth, Twins right-hander Kevin Jepsen got a strikeout and a pop out in foul territory to start the inning. But a double to left by Joey Rickard and an intentional walk to Manny Machado put two men on for Jones, who smashed a shot toward Twins left fielder Oswaldo Arcia. Arcia didn\xe2\x80\x99t take a proper route to the ball and it landed in front of him, caroming off Arcia\xe2\x80\x99s foot when his diving attempt at a catch came up short. Both runners, who had advanced to second and third on a wild pitch, scored on the play. \xe2\x80\x9cI gotta get that third out,\xe2\x80\x9d Jepsen said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the bottom line.\xe2\x80\x9d Jones also mashed the second of back-to-back home runs off Twins starter Jose Berrios in the fifth inning, which gave the Orioles a 3-1 lead. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing good baseball as a team,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as we keep winning, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter how it goes as long as the team wins. That\xe2\x80\x99s the main objective, the main goal.\xe2\x80\x9d Machado had three hits, including his 10th homer, and walked twice. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day got the win in relief of Kevin Gausman, pitching one inning of relief. Jepsen took the loss, dropping to 2-4 on the season. Jepsen was charged with two runs, both earned, on three hits and a walk in an inning of work. Orioles closer Zach Britton worked a perfect ninth for his eighth save. Trevor Plouffe had a pair of hits, including a two-run homer, and drove in all three Twins runs. Gausman allowed three runs on five hits and two walks, striking out nine in a no-decision. The homer he allowed to Plouffe in the sixth inning prevented him from a chance at a victory. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously, I was upset after the home run. Anytime you\xe2\x80\x99re cruising and in your last inning, one of the worst pitches you throw gets hit out of the park to tie the ballgame,\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the back of my head, I always try to think \xe2\x80\x98Go nine innings,\xe2\x80\x99 but to give your team a chance to win, a quality start is all you really need to do.\xe2\x80\x9d Twins right-hander Jose Berrios also got a no-decision, allowing three runs on eight hits and a walk in five innings. Berrios fanned six in his third career start. Minnesota cracked the scoreboard in the first inning, using back-to-back one-out singles to ignite the rally. Eduardo Nunez and Brian Dozier each singled to put runners on the corners with one out for Plouffe, whose sacrifice fly to center scored Nunez from third. \xe2\x80\x9cI was pleased we at least came out and competed a little better than I thought we have been of late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Twins manager Paul Molitor. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir guy threw the ball awfully well.\xe2\x80\x9d Baltimore got even in the fourth. After a one-out double by Mark Trumbo, Matt Wieters followed with a sharp single past an outstretched Joe Mauer at first, scoring Trumbo. Machado and Jones hit back-to-back homers two pitches apart in the fifth as Baltimore took a 3-1 lead.  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), ('Trumbo Leads Orioles In Homeruns With 11, One More Than ...', ' By The Sports Xchange MINNEAPOLIS \xe2\x80\x94 Mark Trumbo hit a pair of homers, and Chris Davis and Adam Jones had four hits apiece as the Baltimore Orioles beat the Minnesota Twins 9-2 on Wednesday afternoon at Target Field. Baltimore won the final two games of the three-game series after the first was postponed until July on Monday. The Orioles have won four-straight games, their longest winning streak since starting the season 7-0. Minnesota has lost seven consecutive games and has dropped 11 of its past 12 games. Orioles right-hander Tyler Wilson (2-1) pitched seven solid innings, allowing two runs on six hits and a walk while striking out two to get the win. Phil Hughes (1-6) took the loss for Minnesota, allowing five runs on six hits over four innings. Three of the hits he surrendered were home runs and his six losses are the most in the majors. Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s two-run blast in the second inning gave the Orioles an early 2-0 lead and was a sign of things to come for the middle of the Baltimore lineup. The 3-4-5 hitters of Jones, Davis and Trumbo combined to go 10-for-15 with four homers and nine RBIs on Wednesday. Miguel Sano, celebrating his 23rd birthday, hit a solo home run in the bottom half of the inning before Davis and Trumbo went back-to-back in the fourth. For the Orioles, it was the sixth time this season they have hit back-to-back homers and third consecutive game they accomplished the feat. Trumbo now leads the team with 11 homers, one more than Manny Machado. An RBI single by Danny Santana drove in one and got Minnesota within 5-2 in the bottom of the fifth inning, but the Orioles tacked on single runs in the sixth and seventh innings to put the game away. Each time, it was Davis responsible for driving in a run. In the sixth, his opposite-field drive came inches short of his second home run of the day, bouncing off the top of the wall. Davis settled for an RBI double. One inning later, his sharp smash down the first-base line was gloved by Byung Ho Park, but Davis beat the relay throw on the double play try, allowing a run to score from third. Jones got his fourth hit of the day on a two-run homer in the ninth inning to make it 9-2.

Although he is a native of Virginia, Justin Verlander has made himself at home when he visits Camden Yards. The 2011 American League MVP and Cy Young Award winner looks to improve upon a 7-0 career mark in Baltimore on Friday when his struggling Detroit Tigers play the second contest of a four-game series versus the Orioles. Verlander will be put to the test versus Baltimore, which overcame a five-run deficit to post its fifth straight victory with a 7-5 triumph in the series opener on Thursday. Chris Davis is enjoying a stellar surge by going 9-for-14 (.643) with one homer, six RBIs and four runs scored in the last three games for the Orioles, who have erupted for 37 runs during their winning streak. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s explosive offense spells bad news for a Detroit club that has surrendered 62 runs in its last 10 contests (1-9). Victor Martinez is a blistering 10-for-13 (.769) with two RBIs and as many runs scored in the last three games and is 4-for-12 (.333) in his career versus Friday starter Chris Tillman. PITCHING MATCHUP: Tigers RH Justin Verlander (2-3, 5.40 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Chris Tillman (4-1, 3.05) Verlander deserved a better fate on Sunday when he scattered three hits and struck out nine over seven scoreless innings of a no-decision versus Texas. The 33-year-old has five quality starts in seven outings, although the two exceptions have been disastrous as he\xe2\x80\x99s yielded seven runs in each to drive up his ERA. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Manny Machado has posted nine multi-hit performances in his last 13 games, but is just 3-for-14 (.214) in his career versus Verlander. Like Verlander, Tillman has also enjoyed success versus Friday\xe2\x80\x99s opposition as he carries a 4-0 career mark while limiting the Tigers to a .183 batting average. The 28-year-old is entering this contest with a flourish, having won his last three decisions while recording four consecutive quality starts. Tillman has struggled with his control, however, issuing four walks in back-to-back outings. WALK-OFFS 1. Baltimore CF Adam Jones has collected seven RBIs and six runs scored during his five-game hitting streak. 2. Detroit 1B Miguel Cabrera has nine hits in his last six contests. 3. Orioles 2B Jonathan Schoop has hit safely in 13 of his last 14 games.

I know 33 games is just a small slice out of a 162 game pizza, so let\xe2\x80\x99s just call it \xe2\x80\x9cso far so good.\xe2\x80\x9d We knew the Orioles had thunder in their bats and it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that they lead the American League in home runs. What is surprising is that the Orioles rank second in the AL in batting average (.275) and on base percentage (.337). Buck\xe2\x80\x99s Birds have come a long way in on base percentage; a year ago they ranked twelfth out of the 15 American League teams at .307. More guys on base for all those home run hitters equal more runs. The Orioles have averaged over seven\xc2\xa0runs a game during their five-game win streak and only Boston and Texas have scored more runs in the American League this year. Coming into the season, here\xe2\x80\x99s what we thought we knew about the 2016 Orioles; they would hit home runs, check (they lead the league). They would play good defense, check (14 errors tied for league low) and their bullpen would likely be among the best in the league, check (lowest bullpen ERA in both leagues). The huge question mark was starting pitching like most teams the Orioles would only go as far as their starting pitching would take them. The O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching has more than held its own. Sure, Ubaldo Jimenez can drive you crazy with his manic-depressive starts; Yovanni Gallardo is on the DL and Kevin Gausman was late getting started but this bunch lead by Chris Tillman has been better than advertised. You won\xe2\x80\x99t confuse them with the Baltimore days of Palmer, Cuellar and McNally but this ace-less staff is doing just fine. The Orioles team ERA of 3.58 is the fourth best in the league. The Baltimore staff is short on quality starts but they\xe2\x80\x99ve done a good job keeping the ball in the park. Despite playing home games in hitter-friendly Camden Yards the Oriole pitchers have given up only 22 home runs, that\xe2\x80\x99s best in the major leagues. By comparison, Cincinnati has given up 63 homers and the Yankees 45, the MLB average is 37. The Orioles starting pitchers don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be great, somewhere between good and slightly better than average should do. Follow this recipe, keep the ball in the park, let the defense make plays, watch the O\xe2\x80\x99s slugger\xe2\x80\x99s slug and let the bullpen finish the job, those are the ingredients that could bring postseason baseball back to Baltimore this fall. \xc2\xa0  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Can\\u2019t Win without the Home Run', 'May 12, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles second baseman Jonathan Schoop (6) hits a two run triple in the seventh inning against the Detroit Tigers at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

But the Birds did it this time with 10 singles out of 12 hits in the game.The biggest hit of them all was a triple by Jonathan Schoop to score the two go-ahead runs. This is the first legit triple of the year for the Orioles, who are last in the American League in this category. Mark Trumbo has one also, but it was the result of a misplayed\xc2\xa0ball lost in the sun.Schoop needed to bury it deep in the right-field corner to get Pedro Alvarez all of the way around from first base, though he does run well for such a big guy.All in all, it was a gratifying win. It looked like a grievous mistake on Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s part to send Ubaldo out for the sixth, having flirted with certain death all evening and throwing 100 largely ineffective pitches. Indeed, he put two on base who would score.But being at the game, it was very interesting to go into the concourses at the pitching change bringing in Vance Worley. In an impromptu conversation with a series of serious O\xe2\x80\x99s fans, everyone believed the Orioles were going to come back.

The Baltimore Orioles won 7-5. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles defeated the Detroit Tigers 1-0 Friday evening on the strength of Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 200th career home run and the shutout pitching of Chris Tillman.It was obvious from the early innings of this game that even a single run might make the difference, even one swing of the bat from either side. And that was the story as Jones\xe2\x80\x99 homer was the only anomaly in a game of zeroes.Justin Verlander, in spite of his mediocre start this season, was his typical nasty self of old. Often when watching Orioles games, I wonder what it is that is happening at the plate that makes a pitcher difficult to hit, as he may not appear to be very unhittable from a distance or on TV. However, the nasty factor was clearly evident on this evening.But Tillman has his own nastiness, especially when his off-speed stuff is working, which it has been this season. After seven scoreless innings, his 3.05 ERA had dropped to 2.58. This is indeed the Tillman we all hoped for over the offseason and wanted to see this year. And then follow Tillman with an inning each of nastiness from Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Zach Britton, and you have a shutout.And a shutout is exactly what it is going to take to win some of these games where the Orioles run into a top pitcher with his best stuff. The O\xe2\x80\x99s offense can be shut down, and to win these sorts of games, the Baltimore pitching is going to need to be nearly as perfect. The Birds did the same against Tanaka and the Yankees last Thursday. The Orioles have been held to less than three runs on nine occasions this year, while holding opponents to less than three runs a total of 13 times.Adam Jones has hit a lot of big home runs in his career. This was the third ever off of Verlander. The most off any pitcher is four, of which there are three culprits: CC Sabathia, Brandon Morrow, Jeremy Hellickson.The Jones homer that I most remember is the line drive he crushed over the Green Monster off former Orioles outfielder Darnell McDonald in the top of the 17th inning at Boston just over four years ago. This made Chris Davis the winning pitcher. Just 10 days later he broke a 3-3 tie in the top of the 15th inning at Kansas City with a game-winning solo shot off Nathan Adcock.

Mandatory Credit: Peter G. Aiken-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have demonstrated the strength of a loaded lineup by having varied players carry the team at different times already in 2016.There has never been any doubt that this Baltimore Orioles team is an unusually loaded batting order throughout. There is really no relief for a pitcher other than the occasional times when a player is grinding through a brief personal slump.Among those dealing with some offensive difficulties early in the season were Adam Jones, Jonathan Schoop, and Matt Wieters. But each hit homers (actually two by Schoop) in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 9-3 comeback win over the Detroit Tigers on Saturday evening.It has been characteristic of Jones\xe2\x80\x99 entire career to have stretches where he is totally on fire and carries the team for a week or so. But some injuries have piled up on him at the end of last year and early this year, raising some concerns in the bigger picture of things. And statistically there is some slight year-to-year regression. Yet Adam can still put together some powerful stretches, especially when he is feeling fine, which he obviously is at this time.After the Tigers cut the O\xe2\x80\x99s 4-2 lead to a single run in the top of the 8th inning off Brad Brach, Jones opened the bottom of the frame by getting that run back in one swing. He had previously doubled and scored on a Mark Trumbo double.So for the last five games, Jones is 11-for-21 with four homers, eight RBIs, and eight runs scored. Since a week ago, his average has risen from .198 to .259. This streak may well continue for more games, and it is no coincidence that the Orioles have won them all since it started.We have seen these kinds of streaks before. In April of 2015, Jones had a nine-game stretch where he went 20-for-39 with five homers and 14 RBIs. In June he had a seven-game stretch where he was 11-for-27 with four home runs \xe2\x80\xa6 the Orioles winning six of those seven games.Though not rare, here on The Baltimore Wire we predicted at the beginning of the season that this would be a monstrous Machado-like breakout year for Jonathan Schoop.

Martinez and Miguel Cabrera on successive pitches, and the Detroit Tigers pulled out a 6-5 victory Sunday to end Baltimore\'s seven-game winning streak.After fanning the first two batters in the eighth with Baltimore up 5-4, O\'Day (2-1) thought he had a third when Martinez checked his swing with two strikes.But first base umpire Mark Wegner ruled the batter did not go around, and Martinez hit the sidearmer\'s next pitch over the center-field wall. Cabrera followed with a drive to left.""I tried to get him to swing at it and I did. Mark Wegner absolutely embarrassed himself,"" O\'Day said afterward. ""It\'s strike three. I was heading to the dugout.""It was the first time since 2011 that O\'Day yielded consecutive home runs.""I\'ll take that loss,"" he said. ""It\'s under my name in the boxscore, but that was terrible. Terrible.""Orioles manager Buck Showalter agreed, noting, ""I don\'t even call it a check-swing.""Manny Machado homered for the Orioles. The defeat denied Baltimore its first four-game sweep of the Tigers since 1992 and its first eight-game winning streak in 11 years.Baltimore was 17-1 when leading after seven innings; Detroit was 0-19 when trailing after seven.The victory was only the second in 13 games for the Tigers, who stranded 11 and went 3 for 11 with runners in scoring position.""At the end we were able to sneak one away there,"" Martinez said. ""Those aren\'t supposed to happen.""Warwick Saupold (1-0), who made his major league debut Saturday night, pitched 2 2/3 innings of two-hit relief. Francisco Rodriguez got three outs for his ninth save.Detroit used a bit of luck to go up 4-3 in the fifth. Justin Upton was credited with a double when his fly ball was lost in the sun by right fielder Nolan Reimold, and James McCann followed with a two-out RBI single.In the bottom half, Caleb Joseph reached on an error by shortstop Mike Aviles and Machado connected off starter Michael Fulmer.The lead stood up until Martinez and Cabrera struck in the eighth.Earlier, neither starting pitcher was particularly effective.After Cabrera hit an RBI single off Kevin Gausman in the top of the first, Jonathan Schoop singled in two runs in the bottom half for a 3-1 lead.Steven Moya drove in a run with a triple in the Detroit second, but the Tigers left the bases loaded and did it again in the third.Ian Kinsler led off the fourth with his seventh home run to even the score.EMPATHY FROM BUCKShowalter insisted the Tigers\' woes can\'t be blamed on manager Brad Ausmus.""He\'s putting everybody in the right positions,"" Showalter said before the game. ""I\'d do all the same things he\'s doing. He\'s part of their solution, not their problem. Trust me. He\'s good. And I wouldn\'t tell you that if I didn\'t think it. I\'d just leave it alone.""TRAINER\'S ROOMTigers: CF Cameron Maybin (broken wrist) did not have any setbacks in his latest rehab start Saturday at Triple-A Toledo and is expected to be activated from the disabled list this week.Orioles: The team must make a move Monday involving DH Jimmy Paredes, who\'s been on the DL all season with a sprained left wrist. ... RHP Yovani Gallardo (shoulder tendinitis) felt no pain Sunday, one day after throwing for the first time in three weeks.UP NEXTTigers: Jordan Zimmermann (5-2, 1.50 ERA) starts against Minnesota on Monday night in the opener of a nine-game homestand.Orioles: After taking Monday off, Baltimore sends Ubaldo Jimenez (2-3, 4.87) to the mound Tuesday night against visiting Seattle.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

05/16/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Calibrating Early Expectations', 'May 14, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones (10) celebrates with teammates after defeating the Detroit Tigers 9-3 at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsBy any standard the beginning of this 2016 season for the Baltimore Orioles has been very good.The loss yesterday and the way it happened was unfortunate and disappointing. Yet the Orioles were out-hit 13-7. Sometimes it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fall your way.Friends who are baseball critics sometimes complain to me about how painfully long is the baseball season. I always say that it is a sport that requires 162 games to sort out the best teams, because the margins of error are so small. Little things can make a game swing one way or the other at a critical time in a close contest. The first team may score two runs on dinker base hits, while the opposing team my hit three screamers right at defenders in the bottom of the same ninth inning.Yesterday it was an umpire\xe2\x80\x99s obviously poor call that was the hinge point of the game. He must have been thinking about his dinner reservation or something like that.With a 23-13 record, the Baltimore Orioles are 10 games over .500. They were never more than seven games over that standard at any point in 2015. At the 36-game point in 2014 (the 96-win season), the Birds had a 20-16 record. They were 22-14 in each of two prior seasons. So this is a good start!As Orioles fans, we all knew that the national prognosticators were incorrect in calling for the total demise of the O\xe2\x80\x99s. It is an annual rite of passage for them, as predicable as the flowering of crocuses before the snow is all melted. So we can be pleased that the Birds are currently on a trajectory to win 103 games if they could sustain the current pace. Of course, at this point the Orioles have played 22 games at home (16-6) and only 14 on the road (7-7). The ability to win games on the road \xe2\x80\x93 a weakness of the team last year \xe2\x80\x93 will be a critical factor for what success is to be attained for this season.Let\xe2\x80\x99s just take a couple of minutes to think through the roster categorically, noting those players who are clearly on a good trajectory for this season versus those of whom we continue to have concerns about \xe2\x80\xa6Players on a good trajectory Position players \xe2\x80\x93 Little more commendatory could be added to what has already been said about the beginning of the season for both Manny Machado and Mark Trumbo. Each is to be found among the league leaders in multiple categories. Adam Jones and Jonathan Schoop seem to have turned the corner on early slumps. Chris Davis is sufficiently contributing, though there is headroom for some higher numbers. Nolan Reimold is doing his job, when he gets to play. Joey Rickard is going to have some ups and downs, but his talent and quick bat should carry him through sufficiently.Pitchers \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Tillman has defined the concept of a bounce-back season. Tyler Wilson and Mike Wright are each contributing well and making the strides that young starters need to be accomplishing. Kevin Gausman has arrived, even considering yesterday. The back-end bullpen arms of Zach Britton, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Brad Brach, Mychal Givens and Dylan Bundy have thrown 79.2 innings between them and have a joint ERA of 2.32. Vance Worley\xe2\x80\x99s ERA for 19.2 innings that include two starts is 2.61.Players of continued concernPosition players \xe2\x80\x93 Pedro Alvarez can obviously put a charge into a ball when he squares it up, and while looking better lately, he stills needs to build on a .205 average to contribute significantly and play more. Catchers Matt Wieters and Caleb Joseph provide the regular plus defense, but the Orioles could use more than a current .225 average between them. J.J. Hardy was not on a trajectory for an All-Star season, but he was sufficiently producing, and no replacement is likely to hit better. Ryan Flaherty is great for his defensive versatility, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve long ago given up any hope that he can out-hit even Mario Mendoza (actually, they both have the same career batting average of .215). \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/8 - Baltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters Suits Up for His First Game Against Orioles5/8 - Baltimore Orioles Player Profile: Aderlin Rodriguez5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from AngelsPitchers \xe2\x80\x93 It is no surprise that Ubaldo Jimenez is the first name here. He has a good game, then a bad game; rinse, repeat. And nothing has gone correctly for Brian Matusz in 2016, either in spring or for the early season. T.J. McFarland had mixed results but has only given up one run in 13 innings at AAA. Yovani Gallardo was an unnecessary acquisition in my view, and I am fine with his return being later, if ever.But looking back through these summaries, in the big picture there are more Orioles players performing well than there are those that are scuffling along and trying to find their way in the early season. The big picture is rather bright. And again, can the Orioles be a winning team on the road? That might be the big question. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), (""Baltimore Orioles: Is Darren O'Day at risk for a suspension?"", ""For the most part,\xc2\xa0Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day has been as solid as solid can be for the Baltimore Orioles. However the stat sheet from yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game says that he was tagged with a blown save and the loss after giving up back-to-back home runs in the eighth. However anyone who saw yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game knows there\xe2\x80\x99s an asterik by that blown save and loss \xe2\x80\x93 something that O\xe2\x80\x99Day unfortunately addressed after the game.Kevin Gausman\xc2\xa0was a bit off yesterday as well.

Machado managed to break out of his 0-for-12 mini-slump with a two-run homer which gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 5-4 lead. However O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s back-to-back home runs in the eighth off the bats of Martinez and Cabrera ended up sinking the O\xe2\x80\x99s for good on this day. In dropping the finale 6-5, the O\xe2\x80\x99s still took three-of-four in the series.Of course, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the official story was for the game. However the line score andCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsstat sheet can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you the intangibles of the game, and what happened the pitch prior to the Martinez homer was of supreme importance. On a 2-2 count with two outs in the inning, Martinez checked his swing on Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s pitch. Home plate umpire Jeff Kellogg appealed to first base umpire Mark Wegner on whether the swing was checked in time\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and Wegner ruled that Martinez had in fact checked his swing. Unfortunately for O\xe2\x80\x99Day and the Orioles, Wegner was the only person in the ballpark (heck, the only person on planet earth!) who thought the bat didn\xe2\x80\x99t touch the strike zone. O\xe2\x80\x99Day had already begun the march off the mound to the dugout. Yet Wegner\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on the matter was the only one that counted, so it stood as ball three \xe2\x80\x93 Martinez tied the game on the next pitch.To his credit, O\xe2\x80\x99Day said after the game that Wegner didn\xe2\x80\x99t make him throw the pitches to Martinez and Cabrera. However he also had some choice words for Mark Wegner, which gave a few people \xe2\x80\x93 myself included \xe2\x80\x93 some pause (quote courtesy of Steve Melewski, MASNsports):It was a good pitch. If I get him to swing at it and I did. Mark Wegner absolutely embarrassed himself. I have a great relationship with a lot of umpires. Some I consider friends. They have a tough job. It\xe2\x80\x99s a judgement call, but that was pretty egregious. I think all the replays, it\xe2\x80\x99s a swing. Hitters that good don\xe2\x80\x99t need extra chancesIt\xe2\x80\x99s rare that you see a normally soft spoken guy like O\xe2\x80\x99Day speaking that harshly of an umpire. However it also shows how competitive players are, and how fine the line can often be between winning and losing. O\xe2\x80\x99Day is correct to point out that Wegner didn\xe2\x80\x99t make him throw the two home run balls. But he\xe2\x80\x99s also right in what he said above.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerRight as he may be however, he\xe2\x80\x99s also now opened himself up to being penalized by the league. There are ways that you can diplomatically take issue with an umpire\xe2\x80\x99s call, such as saying something along the lines of\xc2\xa0I thought it was this way, obviously he disagreed. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m the first one to admit that it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to say that here in print, but very hard for a player to say it in that manner in the wake of a tough loss.But the fact is that in saying that an umpire\xc2\xa0embarrassed himself probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to make O\xe2\x80\x99Day any friends in the league office. Having said that, O\xe2\x80\x99Day is correct in his assessment of the call itself \xe2\x80\x93 it was horrible. If the league wanted to be fair, they\xe2\x80\x99d simply fine O\xe2\x80\x99Day an undisclosed amount. However any player who pops off in that manner about an umpire is generally suspended.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles slammed to victory by Jonathan SchoopAnd a suspension of course hurts the team in a sense. Now with that said, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect a suspension to be more than one game. But time will tell\xe2\x80\xa6luckily for the O\xe2\x80\x99s MLB has it\xe2\x80\x99s hands full with the biggest brawl in Texas since the Alamo right now, so perhaps O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s comments will go overlooked. "", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Around the AL East, Week 6: The Orioles are tied for the ...', "" Another week of baseball has come and gone and the Orioles still hold on to a share of the AL East lead. If you want to get technical, they actually lead the Red Sox by seven percentage points, but since they're both ten games over .500, they are placed as being tied with one another.    This is kind of a frustrating outcome in that the Orioles are 8-2 over their last ten games and yet still the best they can manage is a tie for the lead. Then again, the Red Sox have seemingly been playing the dregs of baseball for the last three weeks running. Presumably, they'll have to face real teams eventually, and the Orioles will get their shots at some hot messes too. In the meantime, maybe Adam Jones is really back. When I sat down to write this post this time last week, Jones was sporting a .543 OPS. In the span of one week, he has raised his batting line to .267/.328/.442 - that's a .770 OPS, in the ballpark of how he's performed the last couple of seasons. You know who else is on the rise? Jonathan Schoop, who victimized the poor Tigers bullpen in Saturday's game. Baltimore Orioles Record: 23-13Last Week: 5-1 (2-0 at Twins, 3-1 vs. Tigers)Games Ahead: 0 (lost half a game)Upcoming: 3 games vs. Mariners, 3 games at Angels    Orioles starting pitchers have now had six 7+ inning starts in their last twelve games. Some of that may be just evening out their luck after they had a real lack of those types of starts early on. But like, maybe some of them are starting to figure things out at least a little bit? Don't get your hopes up too much - those 12 games have been against some struggling teams.    A whole bunch of pictures from yesterday's annual Little League parade at Oriole Park at Camden Yards:  Great day to be a kid @ The Yard: Youth Baseball Day Parade by Ripken Baseball, Kids Run the Bases & more! #PlayBall pic.twitter.com/z7ADfWrtbH\r \xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) May 15, 2016        You never know, maybe a future big leaguer was among that bunch. Boston Red Sox Record: 24-14Last Week: 6-1 (3-0 vs. Athletics, 3-1 vs. Astros)Games Behind: 0 (gained half a game)Upcoming: 3 games at Royals, 3 games vs. Indians These charmed creatures lit up the AL West teams for 10+ runs four straight games last week, and they scored ten or more in five of the seven games that they played. Is their offense that good, or are the respective pitching staffs of Oakland and Houston just really that bad? That is the real question.    Only one of Boston's next four series is against a team that currently has better than a .500 record. I guess many teams are going to look bad next to a team with a .632 winning percentage. No other MLB team has scored more runs than the Red Sox with 229. They are the only AL team to have scored more than 200. But their 170 runs allowed remains most in the American League. When You Hit On A Top Ten Pick: On Over the Monster, Ben Buchanan and\xc2\xa0like all of his readers are excited that outfielder Andrew Benintendi - the 7th overall pick last year and the #22 prospect in all of MLB according to MLB.com - has gotten a promotion to Double-A Portland. The Red Sox were able to select Benintendi by virtue of really stinking in 2014. Someone Actually Likes Their 3B Coach: I guess not every third base coach is the Windmill. Actually, OTM's Matt Collins\xc2\xa0has a lot of praise for Brian Butterfield's duties as the infield coach, where he believes the defense is perfroming well. Amazing what happens when you're not playing Pablo Sandoval out there. Toronto Blue Jays Record: 19-20Last Week: 3-3 (2-1 at Giants, 1-2 at Rangers)Games Behind: 5.5 (lost two games)Upcoming: 3 games vs. Rays, 4 games at Twins    Here is a Vine of Jose Bautista getting punched right in the face:    The Blue Jays lost this game. A regular mention in this spot through the season has been the ongoing struggle of Troy Tulowitzki. Perhaps like Jones he is making his way up from the depths. While Tulowitzki's still in the doldrums with a .698 OPS, he hit three home runs in the last week and raised his OPS by over 100 points. He Can't Play The Orioles Every Game: On Bluebird Banter, Eric Elliott looks at\xc2\xa0one struggling player, Ryan Goins, wondering if he's playing himself out of a roster spot. I will never forget Goins as the guy who went 5-5 with a walk in a game against the O's last September, even though he's really not very good. Someone Drew The Short Straw: Another struggling Jay is offseason acquisition Drew Storen, whom BB's Scott C. points out is\xc2\xa0just plain bad. Storen has an 8.25 ERA in 12 innings this season. That's still not as high as Brian Matusz's ERA. Tampa Bay Rays Record: 16-19Last Week: 1-5 (0-3 at Mariners, 1-2 vs. Athletics)Games Behind: 6.5 (lost four games)Upcoming: 3 games at Blue Jays, 3 games at Tigers    The Red Sox may be the most potent offense in the AL. The Rays are at the other end of that. No team has scored fewer runs than the Rays. Even the woeful Twins have equaled their output - 128 runs, though the Twins have played one more game. There's not much in the outlook for things to get better for the Rays offense. Their best 2016 performer, Logan Forsythe, landed on the disabled list after\xc2\xa0suffering a hairline fracture in his left shoulder blade. They currently hope he'll be back in the second week of June, so they'll be without him for about a month. Some good news for the Rays offense is that Evan Longoria is getting the ship turned around - perhaps similarly to Jones and Tulowitzki. Longoria is now sporting a .248/.296/.482 batting line. That's a higher OPS than he's had in either of the last two seasons. Exit Velocity Never Lies (Mostly): On DRaysBay, Daniel Russell unearths one of the signs of Longoria's ascent:\xc2\xa0he's been hitting the ball harder. It's pretty simple. The harder you hit it, the less time the defense has to react to the ball before it goes past them. In Your Face, Girardi: Also on DRB, Ian Malinowski\xc2\xa0takes a look at how the Rays have been shifting and how worthwhile that's been - very, it turns out. Plus, there is a gratuitous picture of a nearly empty Yankee Stadium.    New York Yankees Record: 16-20Last Week: 5-2 (3-1 vs. Royals, 2-1 vs. White Sox)Games Behind: 7 (lost half a game)Upcoming: 3 games at Diamondbacks, 4 games at Athletics The Yankees have gone 7-3 since I wrote an article on this website about how fun it is that the Yankees are bad. Even having gone 7-3 over their last 10 games, they're still four games below .500, but with a road trip to play two bad teams over the next week, they could easily put together another good week and nearly be .500 again. Perhaps the biggest Yankees story over the last week is that Aroldis Chapman, one of the first player suspended under MLB's domestic violence policy, made his return and took over the closer's mantle. They will now be working with the formidable trio of Dellin Betances, Andrew Miller, and Chapman going forward. The next biggest Yankees story is that starting pitcher Luis Severino, a young pitcher on whom they have pinned many hopes, landed on the DL with a right triceps strain. Any time you get anywhere near that elbow, you have to worry at least a little bit about Tommy John. Two of the Yankees Opening Day starters are now on the DL, along with CC Sabathia. Don't Forget About Kirby: On Pinstripe Alley, Christopher Novak points out the\xc2\xa0under-the-radar performance of bullpen arm Kirby Yates, who at this point in the season has struck out 17 batters in 14.1 innings. Perhaps that bullpen trio is a bullpen quartet.    Like Jesus Montero Before Him: On Pinstripe Alley, Andrew Mearns celebrated the arrival of\xc2\xa0top catching prospect Gary Sanchez. The 23-year-old is the #3 Yankees prospect and was #55 overall in MLB on their top 100 list. ** Another week begins where the Orioles are in first place. They have little margin for error right now, at least as long as the Red Sox keep winning. But then again, maybe the Red Sox are just as frustrated that they pulled off a 6-1 week and the best they could do is pull into a tie for first.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The Baltimore Orioles will put the majors\xe2\x80\x99 best home record (16-6) on the line Tuesday when they open a three-game series versus one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s best road clubs in the Seattle Mariners. Baltimore began its seven-game homestand with three straight victories before seeing its season-high seven-game winning streak come to an end following a 6-5 setback against Detroit on Sunday. Adam Jones is riding high with an eight-game hitting streak, going 15-for-34 with four homers, 10 RBIs and 10 runs scored as the Orioles jockey with Boston atop the American League East. Seattle is embroiled in a similar battle with Texas in the AL West, however a three-game sweep at the hands of the Los Angeles Angels cooled the momentum of an impressive 8-2 stretch. Robinson Cano saw his 13-game hitting streak come to a halt in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 3-0 setback to the Angels, but has enjoyed considerable success versus Tuesday starter Ubaldo Jimenez (two homers, 6-for-11) and Baltimore (.335) in his career. The Mariners are opening a six-game road trip looking to improve upon their sizzling 13-6 mark away the Pacific Northwest. PITCHING MATCHUP: Mariners LH Wade Miley (3-2, 4.91 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Ubaldo Jimenez (2-3, 4.87) Miley has righted the ship after a disastrous start to the 2016 season, posting a 3-0 mark with a 3.18 ERA in his last four outings following an 0-2 mark and a bloated 8.04 ERA in his previous two. While his recent results are promising, the 29-year-old was taken deep three times in a 6-4 victory over Tampa Bay on Tuesday and has allowed six homers in his last four. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bode well versus the homer-happy Orioles, against whom Miley owns an 0-2 mark with a gaudy 10.13 ERA in three career meetings. Jimenez escaped with a no-decision on Thursday despite yielding five runs on nine hits in five innings in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 7-5 victory over Detroit. The 32-year-old routinely has encountered issues with his control, walking four batters for the fourth time in his last six outings. Former Oriole Nelson Cruz has struggled mightily against Jimenez, going 0-for-12 with nine strikeouts in his career. WALK-OFFS 1.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first person to admit that I was upset that the Orioles had just traded the best starting pitcher that the Orioles had since Mike Mussina. In exchange for Bedard, the Orioles received Tony Butler, Kam Mickolio, George Sherrill, Chris Tillman, and Adam Jones. Nine years later, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at what the Orioles got for Erik Bedard.First, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at Bedard.\xc2\xa0Much like Frank Robinson, Bedard was expected to be a missing piece to the Mariners after Seattle finished with an 88-74 record during the 2007 season. He simply was never the missing piece. Bedard had a 3.67 ERA in 81 innings over 15 starts in 2008 as the Mariners fell to a 61-101 record.\xc2\xa0In 2009, Erik Bedard once again suffered injuries but at least had a 2.82 ERA in 83 innings over 15 starts. The rest of his career was mediocre at best.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerNext, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at who they got for Bedard. Tony Butler was the Mariners\xe2\x80\x99 12th best prospect when the trade occurred. Butler never pitched in the majors as injuries and ineffectiveness plagued him.Kam Mickolio pitched in the majors for 29 games (23 of them with the Orioles) over four seasons with a career 4.83 ERA. He has found success in Japan, pitching for the\xc2\xa0Hiroshima Toyo Carp and the\xc2\xa0Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.George Sherrill was a setup man for the Mariners when he was traded. He turned out being an effective closer for the Orioles and was even their lone All-Star representative in 2008. The Orioles traded him to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2009 for third baseman Josh Bell and pitcher Steve Johnson. Bell was a huge bust, but at least he hit two home runs off Cliff Lee in the same game. Johnson spent some time with the Orioles before the Mariners signed him last offseason.The two gems of the Erik Bedard trade, Adam Jones and Chris Tillman, are still with the Orioles. Tillman has been the Orioles best pitcher since being called up for good in 2012, even earning an All-Star berth in 2013. He has contributed far more to the Orioles than Bedard ever did to the Mariners.Jones gave the Orioles an everyday center fielder who has emerged as one of the best outfielders in baseball. More importantly, Jones gave the team a vocal leader, something that they had long needed. Even with Manny Machado emerging as arguably the best player in baseball, Jones remains the heart and soul of the Orioles. The Orioles fortunes were reversed\xc2\xa0when Jones boldly declared that he wanted to stay in Baltimore back in 2012.Next: Preaching Patience with Pedro AlvarezWhat can\xc2\xa0fans and teams learn from the Erik Bedard trade? Don\xe2\x80\x99t put all your eggs in one basket like the Mariners did. Sell high like the Orioles did. If a guy isn\xe2\x80\x99t a part of your long-term plans, be open to trading him.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThere are quite a few former Baltimore Orioles players who are performing well throughout the rest of Major League Baseball. Could we make an all-former Orioles team out of them?It really is possible, though a couple of positions will be certainly below average. But the pitching staff would actually be quite good and surely above an MLB average.A disclaimer here is that this is not an effort to mock the Orioles or to point out how many good players have gone away and are performing better some other place. This is simply for interest and not to make a statement. Any franchise could probably do the same; it is the nature of the game for players to move around for a variety of reasons. And some perform better in one place or another, also due to a variety of reasons.Let\xe2\x80\x99s begin with a batting order and an imaginary starting lineup (listing each player\xe2\x80\x99s current team) \xe2\x80\xa6Nick Markakis \xe2\x80\x93 RF \xe2\x80\x93 (Atlanta Braves) \xe2\x80\x93 Some Orioles fans will never forgive the organization for not making it happen to keep Markakis after the 2014 season. Concerns about his health and a decline in production have not been realized, as Nick hit .296 with a .370 OBP in 2015. He was hitting about the same this year until a recent 3-for-32 slump has dropped him to .257. But who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be depressed playing for the 9-28 Braves?Steve Pearce \xe2\x80\x93 DH \xe2\x80\x93 (Tampa Bay Rays) \xe2\x80\x93 Everyone loves Pearce and appreciates his time with the O\xe2\x80\x99s. There were some ups and downs. But the Showalter favorite is really performing well for the Rays. Just last night he hit his sixth home run in 23 games while batting cleanup. He is hitting .288 with an OBP of .370.Gerardo Parra \xe2\x80\x93 CF \xe2\x80\x93 (Colorado Rockies) \xe2\x80\x93 He was a great disappointment last year as a late-season acquisition from the Brewers for Zach Davis \xe2\x80\x93 the latter pitching well at the end of last year, though not so this season. Parra is hitting well again now that he is back in the National League, a place he probably belongs and where he leads that circuit currently in doubles with 14.Nelson Cruz \xe2\x80\x93 LF \xe2\x80\x93 (Seattle Mariners) \xe2\x80\x93 As with Markakis, fans resented not seeing Cruz retained. The early performance of Mark Trumbo is helping many forget this loss however. Cruz is hitting reasonably well, though with fewer home runs than three of the O\xe2\x80\x99s. He currently has seven. His average is .265, but tons of walks have his OBP at .363.Danny Valencia \xe2\x80\x93 3B \xe2\x80\x93 (Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s) \xe2\x80\x93 Valencia always could hit a baseball, and he is doing it again now with this sixth franchise.

His five homers were in the last three games!Mark Reynolds \xe2\x80\x93 1B \xe2\x80\x93 (Colorado Rockies) \xe2\x80\x93 Now with his seventh franchise, Reynolds has the strangest stat line (for him) that you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen!

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles Manny Machado and Jonathan Schoop have the best ...', ' Major League Baseball is a big-time business, but that doesn\'t mean there can\'t be some strong relationships built along the way. Together, Manny Machado and Jonathan Schoop have formed a dynamic duo that may be stronger than any other in the majors, and it doesn\'t hurt that they are both really good at what they do.    One has to imagine it is difficult to grow close to anyone in professional sports. It is a short-sighted operation where what you did last year holds little weight if you are scuffling now. On Monday, you could be making the game-winning play only to find yourself released, traded or demoted by the end of the week. So, when a bond forms so tightly between two players, it should be appreciated. Let\'s do that. From another angle Published in Press Box yesterday, former Sun reporter turned Baltimore Baseball writer\xc2\xa0Dan Connolly put together\xc2\xa0a fun piece about the journey the two have gone on together that took them from wiry teenagers in the O\'s farm system to the big-time sluggers they are with the Birds today. It has some things you have heard before: they get at each other about who has the stronger arm (I\'m pretty sure it\'s Machado, but what do I know). And it mixes in some added facts about the conversations they had while taking grounders together in the minors and how they like to frequent steak restaurants around town. Machado even cooks for Schoop from time to time. There are added quotes from J.J. Hardy and Buck Showalter as well. It\'s worth your time to check out.    MASN put together a video last year covering some of the same ground:     Throwing it back The first season the two really played together was in 2011 with the Low-A Delmarva Shorebirds and later the high-A Frederick Keys that same season. That year, they played on opposing sides in the All-Star Futures Game in Arizona with Machado, from Miami, playing on the United States team and Schoop, a native of Curacao, representing the rest of the World. Look at how skinny there were!!           With the Keys, they won both the Northern division title and eventually the Carolina League championship. The following offseason, they were both named to a list of the top 100 prospects in baseball with Machado coming in at number 11 overall and Schoop down at number 82, according to Baseball America.              They made such an impact with the Keys that the club gave a sweet handshake bobble head of the pair to season ticket holders this season. You can admit it, you\'re now jealous of all current Frederick season ticket holders.

These guys are fun and both are playing ridiculously well right now. Schoop is hitting .266/.293/.492. Of major league second baseman, the O\'s man is in the top five in home runs, RBI and slugging percentage, but there is still room to grow as he is fourth among second basemen in strikeouts and has walked just five times in 128 at-bats. At 24 years old, there is no reason to think he won\'t continue to improve.    Meanwhile, the 23-year-old Machado is just ridiculous. He is arguably the best third baseman, both offensively and defensively, in the game. He may soon be thought of as one of the two or three best players in the world. Period. The Miami native is in the top 10 of baseball in batting average (.333), home runs (11), hits (50), doubles (15), slugging percentage (.653) and OPS (1.040). I mean, COME ON! Can you split up Batman and Robin? With the rate at which they are producing, the writing is on the wall. They will need to get PAID eventually, likely with deals that include at lot of zeros at the end. Machado\'s eligible for free agency in 2019 with Schoop following him a season later. It will be tough to manage. Manny may end up with something close to the richest deal in baseball history and Jonathan is a power hitter in a position that historically lacks players with that ability. What are you to do? Those are decisions that Dan Duquette is paid to make, with a lot of help from the Angelos family. As viewers, it\'s easier let them worry about that and just sit back and enjoy these two players having fun on the diamond. (And before you mention it in the comments, Adrian Beltre and Elvis Andrus have a sweet bromance too, but the Machado/Schoop combination is just a bit sweeter) *stats taken prior to the start of games on Monday, May 16, 2016    Thanks for reading!

TV: 12:35 p.m. ET, MLB Network, MASN (Baltimore) The Baltimore Orioles tend to win when they can get the ball to fly out of the ballpark, and their 57 home runs are a big reason why the team is in first place. The Orioles will try to get more out of the park for the second straight day when they host the Seattle Mariners in the rubber match of a three-game series on Thursday. The Mariners pounded out a pair of home runs in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s 10-0 thrashing to open the series but were out-homered 2-1 on Wednesday as Mark Trumbo and Matt Wieters each went deep for Baltimore. Wieters, who recorded one of the team\xe2\x80\x99s two hits on Tuesday, added an RBI double and scored a pair of runs to lead the Orioles to the 5-2 triumph. Baltimore has won eight of its last 10 to jump back into first place in the American League East and is 17-7 at home. The Mariners are losers of four of five but still sit atop the AL West and will face four consecutive teams with losing records after finishing up with the Orioles. PITCHING MATCHUP: Mariners RH Nathan Karns (3-1, 3.51 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Tyler Wilson (2-1, 2.93) Karns is enjoying a string of four straight quality starts but was held out of the decision in each of the last two. The 28-year-old was reached for three runs on six hits and three walks while striking out five in 6 1/3 innings against the Los Angeles Angels on Friday. Karns spent the last two seasons in the AL East with the Tampa Bay Rays and went 0-1 with a 3.86 ERA in four starts against Baltimore. Wilson has been strong since transitioning from the bullpen into the rotation and has yet to allow more than three runs in an outing. The Virginia native held the Minnesota Twins to two runs on six hits and one walk in seven innings in his last outing on May 11 to earn a win. Wilson is still looking for his first home win of 2016 and pitched a scoreless inning of relief against Seattle last season. WALK-OFFS 1.

05/20/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Popularity of Brooks Robinson', ""Is Brooks Robinson the most popular player in the history of the Baltimore Orioles? In my opinion he is, however what do you think and why?Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 great Brooks Robinson celebrated his 79th birthday this past week. Anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s ever followed the Birds knows who Robinson is, and his effect on baseball. There\xe2\x80\x99s a guy named Schmidt who was pretty decent at the hot corner up the road in Philadelphia as well \xe2\x80\x93 but for my money Brooksie\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest third baseman of all time.If you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me, his 16 consecutive gold gloves will convince you. Schmidt had nine \xe2\x80\x93 which mind you is an unbelievable feat \xe2\x80\x93 but Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s 16 STRAIGHT gold gloves ends the discussion in my view. The knock on Robinson is that Schmidt had better numbers at the plate, and he did. However the \xe2\x80\x9cgreatest ever\xe2\x80\x9d discussion in my view is primarily a defensive one when it comes to a position like third base. All of this is debatable \xe2\x80\x93 this is just my view.But here\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting point; has there ever been a more popular player in Baltimore than Brooks Robinson? I\xe2\x80\x99m of the generation that grew up with the Ripkens, Murray\xe2\x80\x99s, Dempsey\xe2\x80\x99s, and later the Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s of the world. But I can tell you that my Dad, my Uncles, and most relatives of their generation idolized Brooks. And not just for his prowess on the field, but because of who he is. Live Feed brooks robinsonTexas Rangers: Can Adrian Beltre be the Greatest Third Baseman Ever? Call to the PenFirst baseman Jim Gentile was the first big \xe2\x80\x9cstar\xe2\x80\x9d after the Orioles came to Baltimore. My Dad remembers him well, and they loved watching him play. But Robinson was of a totally different quality to anyone who had ever played in Birdland. Furthermore, he seemed to understand what he meant to the community in which he played. There are a lot of current Orioles who seem to get that now, but on many teams that\xe2\x80\x99s just not the case.Furthermore there\xe2\x80\x99s no more humble of a man or an ambassador for the Orioles or the game of baseball than Brooks Robinson. That plays a big role \xe2\x80\x93 the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s a humble person of strong character, and that he was a superstar. You never hear a cross word uttered about Robinson, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily true of a lot of former and current players.However it goes further than that. He helped put Baltimore on the map. The city itself is well-documented as having the appearance of being a stop-over between New York and Washington. When Johnny Unitas and the Baltimore Colts won the NFL Title in 1958, it put the city on the map in a sense. Brooks Robinson, his humble persona, and his golden glove at third base did exactly the same thing.More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerThere are a lot of players beloved by Orioles fans.

He set the standard for all future stars, including those of today.On that note, players of today all look to Robinson as the standard-bearer in terms of being a star in Baltimore.

Two of the brightest stars in the majors square off Friday as the Baltimore Orioles begin a nine-game road trip with a weekend series against the surging Los Angeles Angels. Baltimore shortstop Manny Machado moved to the front of the MVP discussion with a dominant April but surely will be challenged by Angels center fielder Mike Trout, who is heating up following a slow start. Trout began the week by going 7-for-15 with two home runs and six RBI to help the Angels take three of four against the Dodgers in the Freeway Series. The Angels have won six of their last seven games due in large part to the 2014 AL MVP, who is batting .350 with nine home runs, 27 RBI and 26 runs scored over his last 33 games after opening the season with five hits in his first 27 at-bats. Machado has cooled slightly after batting .344 with seven homers in April, but he remains a dangerous threat for a Baltimore team that shares the AL East lead with Boston. The Orioles fell to 17-8 at Camden Yards with Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s 7-2 loss to Seattle, which handed Baltimore its first home series loss of the season. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Mike Wright (2-3, 5.20 ERA) vs. Angels LH Hector Santiago (3-2, 3.42) Wright bounced back from a rough outing against Oakland by yielding two runs on three hits over seven innings in a victory over Detroit on Saturday. The 26-year-old struck out a career-high tying six batters and tossed a career-high 108 pitches while recording his third quality start of the season. Wright made his major league debut against the Angels last season, allowing four hits and striking out six over 7 1/3 scoreless innings in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 3-0 victory. Santiago provided the Angels\xe2\x80\x99 injury-plagued rotation with a welcome boost by pitching eight innings of two-hit ball in a 3-0 win over Seattle on Sunday. The 28-year-old struck out five and flashed an improved fastball after failing to work past the sixth inning in his previous three starts. Adam Jones is 4-for-10 with a home run against Santiago, who is 1-0 with a 2.57 ERA in six career games (three starts) against Baltimore. WALK-OFFS 1.

The reason for it is simple. Pitching on the free agent market is both expensive and volatile. We have seen that for ourselves in the last few years as the O\'s have shelled out for mid-tier (or worse) pitchers\xc2\xa0Ubaldo Jimenez and Yovani Gallardo. Even when signings like that kind of work out for them, and it remains an open question how much either one will work out in the long run, it\'s still not as good as if the team would have been able to draft (or trade for) and develop its own quality pitching corps. Money not spent for rotation answers on the free agent market is money they can use to, say, extend Manny Machado, or keep rather than trade\xc2\xa0Zach Britton as his arbitration raises increase over the next couple of years.    The Orioles can also use extra money to give themselves flexibility to add players like Mark Trumbo, whom another team may give up on when they could have some value to the O\'s.    Not having to give up draft picks is good, too, because that is one more chance the O\'s have to keep adding to their farm system to keep the cycle going. They will not have their top pick this year as a result of signing Gallardo. Pitching on the farm is particularly important for the not-too-distant future of the O\'s because three-fifths of the starting rotation - Jimenez, Gallardo, and Chris Tillman - will be free agents after the 2017 season. They will look to the farm to fill those holes, especially if there are injury problems before then, as they have looked to Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson this season.    Will there be reinforcements for the rotation in a couple of years when the team needs them? That depends. How much of an optimist are you? Triple-A Norfolk Ariel MirandaJoe Gunkel You won\'t find Miranda on MLB.com\'s Top 30 Orioles prospect list, but that\'s because they don\'t count players who were professionals in Cuba, which Miranda was. The 27-year-old lefty debuted in the O\'s system last year and has worked his way up to the Norfolk level. Though at Norfolk, he\'s seen as more of a fringe guy, an honorable mention but not a Top 20 in the O\'s prospect list\xc2\xa0done by John Sickels of SB Nation\'s Minor League Ball back in February.    As a general rule, you don\'t want to draw judgments on a player only by looking at his box scores and stat lines - there\'s a lot of noise in there when dealing with players facing inferior competition, and for some pitchers, with inferior defenses behind them. But sometimes that\'s all there is. Miranda\'s performing decently at the level, a 3.54 ERA in eight starts. He\'s struck out 34 batters in 40.2 innings, though he\'s also walked 16 in the same time. Miranda is a fly ball pitcher, though he\'s only given up three home runs this year. If he keeps up that level of play in the high minors, he\'ll probably at least get a big league shot. Gunkel, 24, is a favorite of mine if only because I like to refer to him as The Gunk. He started his season at Bowie and earned a promotion, but through the small sample size of four Norfolk starts, things aren\'t going well here - a 6.30 ERA. Maybe he needs time to adjust to the International League. Gunkel is the #17 O\'s prospect according to MLB.com. The O\'s acquired Gunkel from the Red Sox when they made a post-DFA trade of Alejandro De Aza last season, so they\'re playing with house money with him and aren\'t out much if he doesn\'t make it. Double-A Bowie Chris LeeDavid Hess These two might be the best shot to fill the hypothetical rotation holes that await starting in 2018. That doesn\'t mean they will, just that, as guys who are at Double-A and enjoying at least some moderate success, they could stay on that trajectory and be ready for a chance at the time the O\'s need to give some guys a chance.    Hess, 22, was the O\'s fifth round pick in 2014.\xc2\xa0ESPN\'s Keith Law is particularly aggressive about Hess, rating him as the #3 prospect in the system:  Hess is a four-pitch guy who doesn\'t have a true swing-and-miss offering but sits mid-90s, bumping 96, with a chance to be a mid-rotation guy if any of the three offspeed pitches improve.  It\'s a big if. He\'s making it work against Eastern League hitters so far this year, posting a 2.33 ERA over seven starts. Something to like is he\'s issued only nine walks in 38.2 innings. Yet he has a 1.34 WHIP even with such a low walk rate. That could be a problem for the future... or a sign that a Double-A caliber defense is giving him BABIP problems that an MLB defense would not. Lee, 23, is interesting by virtue of being a lefty. The O\'s got him from the Astros last year for a couple of international bonus pool slots. A pittance. After that trade, Lee came over and got good results (a 3.08 ERA) while walking a whole lot of people. This year he\'s getting solid results again (3.32 ERA) and he\'s cut that walk rate in half, a respectable 12 walks in 43.1 innings. What makes you raise your eyebrow about Lee\'s 2016 numbers is that he\'s also barely striking anyone out - only 15 on the season. That\'s a 3.1 K/9. A certain O\'s beat writer would tell you it\'s OK Lee\'s not getting strikeouts, but keep this in mind: Lee would be in last place in K/9 among all qualified MLB starters. You need to be able to strike SOME guys out to have any kind of MLB success.    How is Lee making it work? Maybe it\'s the fact that he\'s got a 2.33 ground outs/air outs ratio, meaning he\'s starting to approach Zach Britton level of ground ball tendencies. If a guy was going to weirdly succeed with so few strikeouts, that\'s one way he might do it. Also at Bowie are the enigmatic Parker Bridwell and last year\'s Rule 5 pick Jason Garcia. Neither one presently looks like he\'ll be taking the next step soon. High-A Frederick John MeansTanner Scott These are the two guys on MLB.com\'s top 30 list for the O\'s system.\xc2\xa0Here\'s their capsule on Means:  A 6-foot-3 lefty, Means uses his height to create downhill plane toward the plate, giving him a propensity for generating groundball outs with a 88-92 mph heater that bumps 93-94 mph. His slider, which flashes average at times, has some top-to-bottom tilt to it that gives it curveball-like action, and his changeup has the potential to be Major League average offering as well.  What that adds up to is a 23-year-old who is trying to grind his way up through the system. The Frederick rung of the ladder is going well for Means so far, with 46 strikeouts in 43 innings against only nine walks. His 2.08 ERA is impressive. Probably not worth getting excited for him unless he makes the Double-A jump successfully.    Scott is a lefty reliever who throws 100. Yeah, it\'s crazy! The good news is that batters have only gotten eight hits against him in 20.1 innings pitched. The bad news is he\'s walked 23 guys and has a 7.08 ERA. If he can throw strikes he\'ll get somewhere. That\'s another big if. Low-A Delmarva Ofelky PeraltaGarrett CleavingerBrian GonzalezRyan Meisinger Don\'t mistake quantity for quality here. Peralta, at #14, is the highest placed guy of the bunch of them. If you\'ve been paying close attention to MASN Orioles broadcasts in the last week or so, you\'ve heard multiple mentions of Peralta, including Jim Palmer offering the opinion that Peralta might win this year\'s Jim Palmer Award, given to the O\'s minor league pitcher of the year. A rare Orioles international amateur signing, Peralta is just 19 and enjoying success in full season ball. The 6\'5"" righty is one of those guys who gets the label ""projectable"" applied to him because of an expected improvement to his arsenal when his frame fills out. He\'s doing OK enough already - 35 strikeouts in 32.1 innings, though he has a problem with walks. Don\'t they all? Peralta\'s issued 21 free passes so far. Cleavinger was the O\'s third round pick last year. The 6\'1"" lefty is a reliever who O\'s scouting director Gary Rajsich proclaimed could be the first to debut in MLB out of the O\'s 2015 draft class. May just be a LOOGY but if you\'re like me you\'re feeling like the Orioles could use a new one of those anyway, so maybe Cleavinger will be that guy in time.    Gonzalez was the O\'s top pick in the 2014 draft - when, you\'ll recall, they had no first or second round pick due to signing Jimenez and Nelson Cruz. This is his second year at Delmarva and he wasn\'t good there last year, but he\'s still just 20 and he\'s cut his walk rate and is enjoying good results (2.01 ERA in eight starts). You have to like 37 strikeouts in 44.2 innings - and only two home runs allowed. Meisinger just popped up at #30 on the list yesterday due to Dylan Bundy finally having enough big league service time to lose prospect status. Don\'t get excited about the #30 prospect, especially when he\'s already a reliever in Low-A, but root for him all the same, because he\'s Maryland born. The 22-year-old has struck out 30 guys in 18.1 innings and has a miniscule 0.49 ERA. Elsewhere Hunter HarveyGray FenterPat Connaughton Harvey got some prospect heat after the O\'s drafted him 22nd overall in 2013 - as high as #20 on the Baseball Prospectus 101 before last season. Various injuries, the latest of which was a sports hernia requiring surgery, have kept him from throwing a competitive pitch since 2014. At least they aren\'t Bundy-like injuries to arm and shoulder, and he won\'t have the whole ""must be on MLB roster"" thing any time soon. Fenter was drafted by the O\'s in the seventh round last year and given an overslot signing bonus of $1 million. He had to have Tommy John surgery earlier this year. Dang. Connaughton averaged 4.2 minutes per game for the NBA\'s Portland Trail Blazers this season. I am hoping that inspires him to come back to baseball.    ** There isn\'t another Kevin Gausman here, but then, that\'s not necessarily a bad thing. The O\'s got Gausman as a result of being very bad in 2011. They are not very bad any more. They don\'t get to draft those guys now. That means they have to find less-regarded elsewhere and polish them as best they can. If the Orioles are able to avoid giving up their first round pick in either 2017 or 2018 to sign the next Jimenez/Gallardo-type pitcher, their farm will have done its job as far as pitching is concerned. That, too, is a big if. Not every one of these names has to make it - which is good, because, prospects being prospects, they won\'t. They only need enough to make it to get by.

Winning 25 of the first 40 games is excellent by any standard, even if it is true that 25 of those games were at home rather than on the road. The Orioles were 19-21 at this point a year ago. Before that: 22-18 in 2014, 23-17 in 2013, and 26-14 after the fantastic beginning of the 2012 season that launched this new era of Baltimore baseball.This is a long way traveled from just a couple of months ago when it took over a dozen games to get even a single spring training victory.Yes, there are some warts on this team. Starting pitching can be sketchy \xe2\x80\x93 no surprise there. The powerful offense can be shut down by excellent pitching \xe2\x80\x93 again, no surprise. Players have their ups and downs and mini-slumps.But so many more positive things can be said than negative concerns. The bullpen and defense have been all that everyone hoped and expected them to be. The Orioles lead all of baseball in home runs, with the promise of many more to come if it ever stops raining and gets warm.A new item, for which the O\xe2\x80\x99s are not really getting that much credit, is the on-base percentage number they have established. This has been (justifiably) a major complaint about the team in recent years. At this point, their .331 OBP ranks them second in the American League behind Boston\xe2\x80\x99s .355. The Red Sox lead in almost every offensive categories (we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how long that remains the situation).The Orioles also trail the Red Sox with the second-best team batting average at .267, as well as second in slugging and OPS. And they are fourth in runs scored per game. Fearing that this would be a team that struck out at a prodigious rate, in fact the O\xe2\x80\x99s are ninth in the league in this regard, with Houston already fanning 100 more times. The Birds are league-average in bases on balls.On the pitching side of the equation, the picture is brighter than might have been anticipated six or seven weeks ago. The 3.70 total ERA is fifth in the AL, giving up a fourth-highest runs per game at 3.90. Their walks, strikeouts, hits allowed, total WHIP are all at about the league average.It is no surprise that the Orioles bullpen is among the best. Actually they have the #1 best ERA at the moment at 2.49 with an 11-3 record. And concerns about the pen being overused are overwrought, as the 130.1 innings of work is the exact average in the AL.

The total batting average against the staff of .249 is eighth in the league, just under the .252 AL average.It would seem that there are enough top-tiered players on this team to carry one another through down times and occasional slumps. We have seen this already. So there is much positive about this team. At the same time, one has to worry that, as has also been seen, the best pitching can shut them all down for the most part. And top pitching is what they are likely to see in a postseason short series \xe2\x80\xa6 if they can get there.

The 8-4 victory was capped by a handful of home runs and a gritty start from Mike Wright.    The recap Early on, the Orioles decided that they wanted to take a few strolls around the bases, much to the delight of Buck Showalter and Co. Joey Rickard and Manny Machado kicked off the game with back-to-back solo shots off of Hector Santiago, the right-hander who was fresh off an eight-inning shutout against the Seattle Mariners. With Rickard and Machado's fireworks to kick things off, Mike Wright limped through the first two frames. The Angels got some heavy contact, plating a run in the second inning on a Carlos Perez RBI double, LAA's second two-bagger of the night. With the score at 2-1, that's where things got fun. In the top of the third inning, Mark Trumbo launched a two-run HR, scoring Machado - who walked - and triggering the frustration for the 28-year-old Santiago. After throwing three straight out of the zone to Matt Wieters, the next batter, Santiago began jawing to the home plate umpire, sparking a back-and-forth that resulted in an ejection through just 2.2 total innings.    That sent Mike Scioscia into a shouting match with the umpire behind the dish, ultimately ending in him sending right-hander Mike Morin to the mound to finish off the inning after Santiago was sent to his early shower. It took an hour to complete the first two and a half innings, much to the delight of east-coast viewers ... *sarcasm alert*     Santiago threw a pitch near inside corner to Wieters and said something and HP ump John Tumpane tossed him. Mike Morin comes on.\r \xe2\x80\x94 Steve Melewski (@masnSteve) May 21, 2016     After the firework-filled start, Wright nicely settled down to string together a few scoreless innings.    He hit 97 MPH in the third inning to strike out Albert Pujols, worked a perfect fourth and continued to mow down Angels in the fifth. With the help of some one-pitch quick outs and a few web gems from Machado and Paul Janish (who had a great game at third), Wright kept the Angels off the board through five innings. But as the Orioles bats failed to produce runs against the Angel bullpen, Mike Wright lost control of his start. He allowed three of his first four faced in the sixth inning to reach base, including a surrendered single to Johnny Giavotella that made things 4-2. After a Chris Davis throwing error - an attempted force at second that hit the runner in the elbow - Wright was pulled for Mychal Givens in a bases loaded, one out spot.    Let's just say things didn't exactly go well. Facing Perez his first hitter out of the 'pen, Givens allowed a sac-fly for LAA's third run of the night, getting two outs on the board ... unfortunately, the Angels had one more to play with. Gregorio Petit looped a double into shallow right-field out of the grasp of Rickard, knotting the score at four through six innings of play. Mike Wright's final line: 5 IP, 5 H, 4 R, 2 ER (Davis error), 3 BB, 3 K. But you didn't think the Orioles could hit three HRs and lose, did you? As it turned out, more power was on the docket. In the top of the 7th with Machado at first, Chris Davis went all Crush Davis on us with an opposite-field on a belt-high slider, just over the glove of Rafael Ortega in left. This put the Birds up 6-4, boosting the spirits of Baltimore night-owls everywhere. Givens and O'Day combined for a scoreless seventh inning, while the Orioles offense decided it was time for some insurance runs in the top of the eighth.    All in the top of the frame: Matt Wieters blooped a single to center, Jonathan Schoop ripped a double down the left field line, Nolan Reimold hit a sac-fly to score Wieters (7-4), Janish crushed a pitch to center for a single and Rickard smoked an RBI hit to left (8-4). How's that for a healthy cushion? O'Day worked a nine-pitch bottom of the eighth, Reimold picked up another RBI on a single and Brad Brach shut the door in the ninth. With a 9-4 final, the Orioles pushed the season record up to 10 games over with an AL East-leading 25-15 mark. Numbers to note    He entered with a 5.20 ERA, but Mike Wright managed to go under five after his outing, now sitting firmly at 4.97. Matt Wieters looks healthy and locked in at the plate. After a 3-4 on Wednesday against Seattle, Wieters had three more hits on the night, boosting his season average to .277. Manny Machado had another impressive game at shortstop, also picking up two hits and a walk at the plate. He's hitting .323 on the season - two (or three...ish) words: All-Star Game.

05/23/2016,"[('Orioles trade Brian Matusz to Braves, dump salary with ...', "" The Orioles have traded Brian Matusz. You may be tempted to think that it doesn't matter to whom or for what, except you would be wrong.     Matusz was traded to the Braves, and while the O's get back a couple of minor leaguers in the trade, they've also traded the #76 overall pick - the competitive balance pick that can be traded - to the Braves.  Much like they did last year with Ryan Webb, they've sold a pick to dump a trivial amount of salary. This is a frustrating decision. The two minor leaguers the Orioles received in the trade are right-handed pitcher Brandon Barker and left-handed pitcher Trevor Belicek. By some coincidence, these are the last two Braves 16th round picks.     Barker, 23, has been in the Double-A Mississippi rotation this season, putting up some very good numbers. He has a 2.00 ERA in nine starts, striking out 40 batters in 45 innings pitched and walking only 12. It's added up to a 1.044 WHIP - very nice.    Belicek, also 23, began the season in the High-A Rome bullpen where he has also posted some nice numbers. He's struck out 29 batters in 25.1 innings, and also had one outing in Double-A. Baltimore Baseball's Dan Connolly says that Barker will be headed to Bowie, while Belicek will join Frederick.    With this trade, the Orioles will save about 75% of Matusz's $3.9 million salary that was due for the remainder of the season. It's roughly $3 million in savings. That's slightly more than the amount of Webb's salary the Dodgers ate last year. It's a true salary dump. MLB.com's Mark Bowman reports that the Braves are expected to immediately send Matusz to the great DFA in the sky. Must be kind of embarrassing, though probably not as much as having an ERA of 12.00. The slot value on the 76th pick is $838,900. The Orioles will have that much less money to spend now, and one fewer chance to draft a player who might ever turn into anything. Was that pick likely to ever turn into someone? No, not really. It's the principle of the thing.    If someone was inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to the O's, who have now pulled this caper in two straight seasons, they would probably point out that either Barker or Belicek could be better than whoever the O's might pick at #76. The possibility does exist, it must be said. With apologies for tooting my own horn, I put forth the O's as a team who might trade their pick to the Braves about a month ago and suggested Matusz as the player most likely to fit that bill. Here we are. Being right about this is not fun. Stop trading picks!

PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Chris Tillman (6-1, 2.61 ERA) vs. Astros RH Doug Fister (4-3, 4.22) Tillman has pitched six or more innings in six consecutive starts and has given up just 26 hits in 39 1/3 innings during the stretch. This will be Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s third road start of the season and he is 1-1 with a 4.50 ERA away from home compared to 5-0 with a 2.04 ERA at home. Tillman is 2-2 with a 2.45 ERA in four starts against the Astros and has handled Jose Altuve (2-for-11) and George Springer (1-for-9). Fister has won three consecutive decisions and has a 3.08 ERA over his last four starts to overcome a rocky start. He also has pitched six or more innings in each of his last six outings and issued just four walks over his past four starts after giving up a career-worst seven against Seattle on April 25. Fister is 4-2 with a 4.63 ERA in eight career appearances (seven starts) against the Orioles and has struggled with Pedro Alvarez (5-for-9, one homer) and Chris Davis (5-for-13, two homers).

Such is the case with Brian Matusz, who might not have lived up to his hype, but was still an important member of the 2012 and 2014 Baltimore Orioles. The Orioles likely\xc2\xa0do not win the 2012 Wild Card game without Matusz striking out Josh Hamilton in the eighth inning or without him dominating left handed hitters in September.

Firstly, they must replace him in the bullpen. Short-term, the Orioles have officially called up left handed pitcher Ashur Tolliver, a fifth round pick of the 2009 MLB Draft. He\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty awesome story, overcoming a lot of things that would make most people give up on their dream to potentially achieve his dream of pitching in the majors. Tolliver has found his niche in the bullpen as a lefty specialist. Ironically, he kind of followed the Brian Matusz pathway to being a reliever as he was a failed starter.Long-term, the Orioles have options. Chris Lee, who the Orioles traded for last season, is an option. The Orioles would prefer not to use him in relief since they like him as a starter, but he is an option nontheless. Zach Phillips, who pitched for the Orioles for a spell back in 2011, is another option. T.J. McFarland is another option, though his experience as a middle reliever is limited.\xc2\xa0More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Duensing, just like Brian Matusz, is a failed starter. He has experience as a relief pitcher with 293 relief appearances and has put up a respectable ERA during his time in the bullpen. The primary downside with Duensing is that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t strike a lot of guys out.While striking guys out is hardly a requirement to be an effective pitcher for the Orioles thanks to their great defense, Duensing has never been much of a ground ball pitcher. \xc2\xa0Pitching to contact is fine if you allow a ton of ground balls.

Both team's offenses struggled throughout the evening in Houston as the Orioles fell to the Astros by a score of 3-2 at Minute Maid Park on Tuesday night.    O's waste chances early The Orioles entered the evening in the bottom third of baseball in walks taken. But somehow, they earned three base on balls in the first inning against Doug Fister, a guy who averages less than two walks per nine innings for his career. In the first inning, Manny Machado walked with one out only to be erased by an Adam Jones ground ball double play. In the second inning, Chris Davis led off with a walk. Two batters later, Pedro Alvarez walked to give the Birds two runners with two outs. A Jonathan Schoop single loaded the bases for Ryan Flaherty, who then struck out on four pitches. Bummer. Middle-inning offense Alvarez got the O's on the board first with a\xc2\xa0line drive DONG in the top of the fifth inning. The round-tripper was his third of the season. It came on the sixth pitch of the at-bat as Fister hung a 71 mph curveball.    The Astros answered right back as Tillman struggled with his control in the bottom of the fifth. Evan Gattis led off with a single and Jason Castro followed with a walk. Colin Moran grounded into a double play to alleviate some of the pressure. But Luis Valbuena drove in Gattis moments later with\xc2\xa0a two-run bomb to right field to give the hosts a 2-1 lead.    The rocky fifth continue for the Orioles pitcher as he allowed back-to-back walks to Tony Kemp and George Springer following the Valbuena homer. Jose Altuve smashed an 0-1 fastball, but it went right to Schoop at second base. With that, Tillman was out of the jam. Machado tied things up by breaking out of his current funk with a home run to left field off of an 87 mph Fister home run. in the top of the sixth inning. The ball flew approximately 7,500 feet. (That is just a rough estimate) After that, the right-hander retired the next three hitters to get out of the inning.    Your browser does not support iframes.

He was good and kept the 'Stros in the game. Tillman tossed seven innings for the second time in three starts. He also allowed two runs on three hits but managed to strike out five while walking three. After that, it was up to the relief corps. They held strong. For the Astros, Tony Sipp, Ken Giles and Luke Gregerson combined for 3.1 innings of shutout ball to get through the ninth inning, allowing three hits, one walk and five strikeouts between the trio. Baltimore had Darren O'Day pitch a scoreless eighth inning and Brad Brach took the ninth in easy fashion The closest either team would come to scoring was in the Orioles half of the ninth inning. Matt Wieters singled. Then, with Schoop batting, the O's catcher STOLE SECOND BASE! Woo! It was glorious. Schoop then singled but Wieters wasn't speedy enough to score from second. Boo! A Flaherty walk loaded the bases for Joey Rickard, but he couldn't come through, striking out on three pitches.    On to extras The tenth inning saw the O's go three-up, three-down. In the bottom of the inning, the Astros got two men on with two outs, but another Altuve lineout ended the threat. Wieters got a one-out double in the 11th inning and was pinch ran for by Nolan Reimold. Reimold advanced to third on a ground out by Alvarez but that is where he would stay as Schoop grounded out for the third out. In the Houston half, they went quietly. Rickard got himself a one-out double in the 13th inning. An intentional walk to Machado gave the O's two men on for the middle of the order, but the Baltimore sluggers really struggled all game. Jones and Davis struck out back-to-back for outs number two and three. The game came to an end in the 13th inning. With Dylan Bundy pitching, Kemp led off with a long triple over the head of Jones in center field. Left with few choices, Bundy then gave Springer and Altuve intentional passes to load the passes for Carlos Correa.

Rookie Tony Kemp lined a triple over Jones\xe2\x80\x99 head leading off the 13th inning and Carlos Correa later added a walk-off single to lift the Houston Astros to a 3-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles at Minute Maid Park. Kemp, who made his major league debut on May 17, recorded his first career triple by taking advantage of Jones\xe2\x80\x99 shallow positioning in center. Once that ball carried over Jones the Astros (18-28) were poised against right-hander Dylan Bundy (0-1), the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fifth pitcher of the game. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many times that kid has hit the ball that far, but he crushed it,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cI gave it my best effort. I was pretty shallow, but I gave it my best effort.\xe2\x80\x9d Bundy followed by intentionally walking George Springer and Jose Altuve to set up a force at every base before Correa followed with the game-winner, snapping an 0-for-15 skid with his hit to center field. \xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking this is great,\xe2\x80\x9d Correa said of the intentional walks that preceded his at-bat. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is where it is.

It\xe2\x80\x99s really good it happened.\xe2\x80\x9d Houston rode a magnificent effort from its bullpen. Six Astros relievers combined for 16 strikeouts to match the club record for strikeouts by relievers set against the St. Louis Cardinals on April 25, 1962. Michael Feliz (2-1) struck out the side in the 13th, but Tony Sipp, Luke Gregerson and Scott Feldman all recorded at least three strikeouts. \xe2\x80\x9cEach guy came in and did a job,\xe2\x80\x9d Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a little bit of trouble here and there and guys pitched out of it but to a man those guys came in and closed out innings with zeroes when we really, really needed it.\xe2\x80\x9d Springer finished 3-for-4 with two walks while batting leadoff for the second time this season. First baseman Luis Valbuena also recorded a multi-hit game going 2-for-4 with a two-run homer in the fifth inning. Right-hander Chris Tillman gave the Orioles seven strong innings, allowing two runs on three hits and three walks with seven strikeouts. When Tillman finally departed the Astros threatened almost immediately against the Orioles bullpen, with Springer turning a flare into right into a hustle double with one out and a tie game in the eighth. However, Orioles reliever Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day recovered to retire Altuve and Correa on hard-hit balls to leave Springer stranded on third base. The Orioles fashioned a threat in the ninth against Gregerson, loading the bases with two outs before Gregerson struck out leadoff hitter Joey Rickard to end the frame. Gregerson, like Feliz, struck out the side. Astros right-hander Doug Fister had his run of six consecutive quality starts end after he labored into the sixth inning. Pedro Alvarez lined a hanging breaking ball into the right field seats leading off the fifth, giving to the Orioles (26-17) a 1-0 lead with his third homer. Manny Machado opened the sixth with his 13th homer, this one above the train tracks in left field to tie the game at 2-2. Three batters later, Fister was gone, needing 106 pitches to complete 5 2/3 innings in which he allowed two runs on three hits and three walks. \xe2\x80\x9cYou saw two good teams pitching well tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to think that, but you\xe2\x80\x99d still like to find a way to scratch something across and make good use of a real good outing by our pitching staff.\xe2\x80\x9d  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com')]"

So also was contacting the baseball with the bat.The good news is that the Orioles lowered their strikeout total in the final game to only 15 (after previous evenings of 19 and 18), but the bad news is of course that this is still a terribly high number for nine innings.And the worse news is that, according to Steve Melewski\xe2\x80\x99s MASN column after the game, this is a new MLB record for a three-game series \xe2\x80\xa6Houston fanned 19 Orioles on Tuesday, 18 last night and 15 tonight. The three-game total of 52 set a major league record. The Orioles have struck out 73 times the last five games.Having lived through the era of the 60s and 70s with great pitchers like Bob Gibson, Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Nolan Ryan, and the staffs of the Orioles as well, it is difficult to imagine that this has never happened before!Perhaps the worst news of all is that the Astros put on display the methodology for shutting down the O\xe2\x80\x99s high-powered offense. It involves lots of off-speed pitches and junk.

It is a total mystery why teams are defending him as they are, playing against the pull when in fact the new O\xe2\x80\x99s outfielder is the stereotypical spray hitter.Also on playing time, I understand why the Orioles want to develop Joey Rickard, given the great spring and early season. But clearly Nolan Reimold is a better option, at least at this point \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe not forever, but help is needed now.The Pedro Alvarez thing is simply not working out. Why does this not feel like a surprise?Orioles pitchers are simply not throwing enough of their secondary pitches of late. That is the key to successful pitching (as seen by the Astros).

Two teams streaking in different directions square off on Friday as the Cleveland Indians host the Baltimore Orioles in the opener of their three-game series. Cleveland has sandwiched five- and three-game winning streaks around a three-game slide and enter the matchup with Baltimore having captured the final three contests of a four-game set against the American League Central-leading Chicago White Sox to conclude a 6-3 road trip. The Indians are hoping Rajai Davis breaks out of his slump as the leadoff hitter is 1-for-18 over his last six games, with the hit being a home run. Baltimore kicked off its nine-game road trip with a pair of victories over the Los Angeles Angels but has lost four in a row since, including a 4-2 setback at Houston on Thursday that completed a three-game sweep. The Orioles have struggled to score on the trek, producing three runs or fewer in each of their last five contests after beginning the trip with a 9-4 victory. Making contact at the plate will be imperative for Baltimore, which has struck out 73 times over its last five games \xe2\x80\x93 including 52, a dubious major-league record for a three-game series \xe2\x80\x94 against the Astros. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Mike Wright (2-3, 4.97 ERA) vs. Indians RH Trevor Bauer (3-2, 4.31) Wright has allowed two earned runs in three of his last four starts, including a no-decision at the Los Angeles Angels on May 20 in which he gave up four runs overall on five hits and three walks in 5 1/3 innings. The 26-year-old native of South Carolina has done a good job of keeping the ball in the park this season, permitting four home runs over 41 2/3 frames after serving up nine in 44 2/3 innings last year \xe2\x80\x93 his first in the majors. Wright, who never has faced Cleveland, is 1-1 with a 5.94 ERA in three road starts this campaign. Bauer will be making his sixth consecutive start after beginning the season with six relief appearances in which he surrendered six runs over 11 1/3 innings. The 25-year-old Californian suffered his second straight loss Saturday at Boston, where he yielded four runs and eight hits in five frames. Bauer has yet to defeat Baltimore in his career, going 0-2 while allowing eight runs and 11 hits \xe2\x80\x93 four homers \xe2\x80\x93 over 11 1/3 innings in two starts. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles SS/3B Manny Machado is 2-for-5 lifetime against Bauer, with both hits being solo homers. 2. Cleveland has been red-hot at home, scoring a total of 28 runs in its last two contests at Progressive Field. 3. Baltimore SS J.J. Hardy, who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played since May 1 due to a fractured left foot, has been cleared to walk on the foot.

Mandatory Credit: Thomas B. Shea-USA TODAY SportsAfter a horrendous series in Houston, the real Baltimore Orioles returned to the field on Friday evening to defeat the Cleveland Indians 6-4.If there was ever any doubt that Buck Showalter is a genius, last night proved it with Adam Jones being put into the leadoff spot. Very few Orioles fans (who are honest) when seeing the posted lineup before the game were saying, \xe2\x80\x9cExcellent. This is just what we need \xe2\x80\x93 Adam Jones hitting leadoff!\xe2\x80\x9dWhy would anyone think that Jones belongs at the top of the order? He was hitting .223 with an OBP of .282!\xc2\xa0 He has not done it since 2010, and his career numbers in 21 starts are a .240 average with an OBP of .284. But Jones led off the game with a hit and went 3-for-5.Manny Machado came back into his body from wherever he has been lately and cracked four base hits. And Jonathan Schoop got a critical two-out hit in the bottom of the first inning to drive in two runs, showing the sort of hitting that has been entirely missing of late. And finally, Mark Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s home run proved to be the difference.What a difference a day makes. This new Orioles team looked more like the one we saw opening week of the season \xe2\x80\x93 not swinging wildly at pitches and making the pitcher come to them.Beyond that, the defense returned. Particularly making nice plays were the middle infielders, as Buck commented after the game, \xe2\x80\x9cThe middle guys on the diamond made great plays on both sides of the ball.\xe2\x80\x9dThe win moves the Orioles back to within a game of first-place Boston, who lost to the Jays 7-5.

Were the O\xe2\x80\x99s simply that bad in Houston, or were the Astros pitchers simply that good? The answer is probably a mix of both. Having made the playoffs last year, and in spite of the poor start on this 2016 season, there is no doubt that the Astros are a pretty good baseball team. It will be interesting to see if they put together some fine games and streaks over the next couple of weeks.Now the question will be to see which offense shows up for game two of the series. And beyond that, it will also be interesting to see which Ubaldo takes to the mound \xe2\x80\x93 the good one or the bad one. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Ubaldo does Ubaldo things as Orioles blown out by \\u2026', ' In the classic film The Princess Bride, the hero Westley, in the guise of the Dread Pirate Roberts, tells his childhood love Buttercup, who does not yet recognize him, ""Life is pain. Anyone who says differently is selling something."" He must have just finished watching an Ubaldo Jimenez start.    So, too, did the unfortunate Orioles fans who tuned in to Saturday afternoon\'s lopsided 11-4 loss against the Indians. Jimenez was every bad stereotype about his pitching rolled into one. Can\'t throw strikes? You know it. Turning every baserunner into Usain Bolt? Yes, that too. It takes some hard work to manage to give up four stolen bases in the span of an inning and two-thirds, which was as far as Jimenez pitched into the game before Buck Showalter had seen enough and yanked him in favor of Vance Worley. Jimenez is surely up to that challenge. The ultimate Ubaldo start The hows and whys are almost not even worth discussing at this point. They are what they are because he is what he is. If for some reason a person was inclined to be generous towards Jimenez\'s pitching, they might note that three of the six runs Jimenez gave up were unearned - those being the result, directly and indirectly, of a Pedro Alvarez error at third base.    Alvarez in fact made two errors in the game. He should not be a third baseman. With a .194 batting average and a .644 OPS, it\'s not entirely clear what he should be, other than mostly on the bench.    In all, the Orioles committed four errors in the game, another sloppy effort. Only five of the Indians\' eleven runs were earned. Of course, five runs still would have beaten the Orioles today. There\'s no reason to be generous towards Jimenez because you have to be worse than just one Alvarez error to be yanked from a game before finishing the second inning. You have to be bad enough to walk three guys and give up five hits while recording only five outs.    It\'s now Memorial Day weekend and the highest-paid free agent pitcher the Orioles have ever signed is in the third year of his four year contract and he is sitting on a 6.36 ERA after this start. He is pitching as poorly as that ERA looks. Every start, it seems, the Orioles have to plan for what to do if Jimenez has another meltdown. Today, the plan was to have Worley go as far as possible, and he did yeoman\'s work in coming in to the blowout to eat up as many innings as possible. That ended up being 4.1 innings, so he got the O\'s at least through the sixth. What to do with Jimenez? Even the normally-sunny Jim Hunter was openly speculating on the MASN telecast about what the Orioles might have to do with Jimenez. You can kind of imagine that another bullpen demotion, along the lines of what the O\'s did with him in 2014, could be in his future.    Whether Worley or whoever else proves to be a good option as a starting pitcher for the O\'s, they all have one virtue: They are not Jimenez. Until Jimenez gets his act together, the Orioles are basically destroying their chances to win once every five games. That\'s a lot of games to just give up on. Sure enough, they were handed a gift opportunity today, with the Red Sox blowing a game late against the Blue Jays. Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel blew a save on his birthday, this after Boston took a ninth inning lead following different relievers blowing a Sox lead in the eighth. So the Red Sox lost and the Orioles had a chance to pull back into a tie for the AL East lead. Except they never really had a chance, not as long as Jimenez was the scheduled starter. That\'s just how it is right now. They will remain one game back. With such a deficit that they faced in the game, the Orioles scoring a few runs didn\'t matter too much for the sake of today\'s game. But perhaps it\'s a positive sign that eight of the nine starting position players had at least one hit - and even the hitless Joey Rickard walked twice. Another encouraging thing for the offense was that Mark Trumbo had a three hit game. Trumbo has been slumping lately, batting just .174 over the past seven days before today. If he\'s heating up, maybe that can carry over to tomorrow.    As bad as today\'s game was, it was only one loss. The Orioles will take the field tomorrow with a chance to win the series. Chris Tillman, the O\'s best starting pitcher by ERA, will be starting the game, while the Indians will send out Mike Clevinger, who has only ever made two MLB starts. The finale is scheduled to get under way at 1:10. Go do something fun with your night and don\'t think about this game any more.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have problems with the starting rotation, as expected. But what to do about it is not obvious or simple.There will be a cry from some that the Birds need to go out somewhere and make some sort of move to get a veteran starting pitcher who can be counted upon. Why would such a player be available out there (wherever \xe2\x80\x9cout there\xe2\x80\x9d is)? \xc2\xa0Why would such a player not be of indispensable value to his current team?The Baltimore Orioles have previously \xe2\x80\x9cgone out there\xe2\x80\x9d and gotten what are supposed to be dependable, effective, innings-eaters types of starters. There is $22 million of the 2016 payroll dedicated to such.So, how has that worked out?The O\xe2\x80\x99s are 6-8 in games begun by the pair of expensive, mercenary starters. At the same time, two rookie pitchers \xe2\x80\x93 who admittedly are learning on the job \xe2\x80\x93 have seen the Orioles go 8-6 in their games started. They are doing it at five percent of the cost of the \xe2\x80\x9cout there\xe2\x80\x9d acquisitions.While it is true that Gallardo is coming back from an injury and his history with the Orioles is only four games, it is not as if there were not concerns of this very eventuality. It is not beyond total imagination that he could yet come back and pitch well for the Orioles, even beyond this year. But I fear it is even more imaginable that the very opposite could come true.Yes, we are talking about buyer\xe2\x80\x99s remorse. We can argue until the cows come home about whether or not this was predictable, and for the record, here at The Baltimore Wire we were rather skeptical of both moves, while hoping for the best.Perhaps an illustration will help communicate the major premise here. You buy a beautiful home alongside a lovely river. There have been some floods, though the home has weathered them historically. However, now the weather systems have changed, as have conditions upstream. The home floods regularly. You can\xe2\x80\x99t sell it; nobody will by it. You have so much investment that you have to attempt to keep living in it and keep it repaired from that last flood. So here is the question: having bought such a home a couple of times, would you look to buy another expensive home on a river, or build a newer inexpensive house on higher ground?So, enough with piling up veteran pitchers. They clog the developmental arteries. Now that we have a couple of these guys, there needs to be some continual effort to get them to deliver some value. That is a sad reality.

The Cleveland Indians have pushed their way to the top of the American League Central and will try to secure a third consecutive series win when they host the Baltimore Orioles in the rubber match of their three-game series on Sunday. The Indians have won nine of their last 13 contests to pull a season-high five games over .500. Cleveland dropped Friday\xe2\x80\x99s series opener 6-4 but got the offense moving again in an 11-4 victory on Saturday that featured three RBIs from Yan Gomes and two more from Mike Napoli. The Indians figured to lean on their pitching staff this season but are coming together offensively over the last two weeks, scoring six or more runs in seven of their last 13 contests. The Orioles sit one game behind Boston in the AL East but haven\xe2\x80\x99t helped themselves by dropping five of their last six. Baltimore has been in a bit of a funk offensively during the slide and have produced more than four runs only once in its last seven games \xe2\x80\x93 Friday\xe2\x80\x99s triumph. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Chris Tillman (6-1, 2.61 ERA) vs. Indians RH Mike Clevinger (0-1, 8.71) Tillman hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost since April 14 but did not figure in the decision at Houston on Tuesday despite allowing just two runs and three hits in seven innings. The solid outing marked the seventh straight quality start for the 28-year-old native of California. Tillman is 4-2 with a 3.89 ERA in seven career starts against Cleveland and earned a pair of wins over the club last season. Clevinger is making his third major-league start and is running out of time to prove himself with Carlos Carrasco (hamstring) making his way back from the disabled list. Clevinger was lit up for six runs on seven hits and three walks in five innings at the Chicago White Sox on Monday to absorb his first loss. The 25-year-old has surrendered three home runs in 10 1/3 total frames. WALK-OFFS 1. Napoli is 6-for-19 with two home runs, seven RBIs and six runs scored in his last five games after going hitless in the previous four contests. 2.

The good news for the O\xe2\x80\x99s as a team is that they have a shot at taking the series this afternoon\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6but the bad news is that they might have reached a point of no return with Jimenez. After the game Jimenez gave a fairly nebulous quote which in a way could be interpreted as confidence moving forward (quote courtesy of Shane Jackson, MLB.com):That\xe2\x80\x99s the thing about baseball. When things are going bad, everything falls apart. Whatever you do out there just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go your way. But things change, and I have a feeling things are going to change.I say that\xe2\x80\x99s a nebulous quote in a sense because one could look at it and assume that Jimenez is going to work hard to right his command and be better by his next start. However he also might be referring to the fact that he understands that the Orioles have to do something with him at this point. Something is going to have to change one way or the other.I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say it again based on the number of tweets I get saying that the Orioles should just cut him. Ubaldo Jimenez is owed approximately $13 million plus \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s whether he ever sees the mound again. The Orioles can\xe2\x80\x99t just cut/DFA him, because that money will still go to Jimenez whether he\xe2\x80\x99s on the roster or not. Furthermore any other team could pick him up \xe2\x80\x93 at the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 expense.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerAs much as Toronto seems to love picking up whomever the Orioles release, do fans really want the Birds paying a player to play against them in the AL East? It\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to say that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be any help to anyone and so forth, but I suspect most people know that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily true. But in a business sense it makes no sense to pay a guy to play for someone else. So once again, let\xe2\x80\x99s just assume that\xe2\x80\x99s not an option for the moment.I suspect that Jimenez is either going to come in today or tomorrow feeling pain in his shoulder, elbow, lateral muscle, etc, or he\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to the bullpen.\xc2\xa0Vance Worley picked up the slack for Jimenez rather well yesterday afternoon, so I suspect he\xe2\x80\x99d be a prime candidate to replace Jimenez in the rotation. Mind you, that\xe2\x80\x99s just a prediction on my part. For all I know he\xe2\x80\x99s staying in the rotation.However if in fact Jimenez\xc2\xa0has an injury, you might see the O\xe2\x80\x99s send\xc2\xa0Yovani Gallardo on a very quick rehab assignment so as to replace Jimenez on the roster. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be prior to his next turn in the rotation, but it could certainly be prior to the one following that. Again, just a prediction.

The restaurant is empty, which means that you can hear the chefs pounding the veal in the back. There will be many more customers later.The first time Palmer came here, in 1984, it was also empty. He peeked in and backed away, but the owner impressed him. When she was younger and part of an Orioles fan club, she explained, she had always wanted his autograph. Palmer dutifully tried the restaurant, loved it, and when he learned it was struggling, he gave it a plug to a local columnist. Now here it is, all these years later, thriving.So is Palmer, who strikes you, in his adopted hometown, as a bit like Rocky Balboa in \xe2\x80\x9cCreed,\xe2\x80\x9d the last movie in the \xe2\x80\x9cRocky\xe2\x80\x9d series. That character carried himself, in Philadelphia, with the easy confidence of a neighborhood legend who had starred in the 1970s, never had to prove himself again, and never abandoned his roots. That is Palmer in Baltimore \xe2\x80\x94 minus the loneliness that shrouded Rocky.Palmer, at 70, is anything but lonely. He is married with a stepson and two grown daughters, and still works road trips and home games in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 broadcast booth. He is surrounded by baseball, and by fans who adore him.

Privacy Policy    The Orioles have played in six World Series, and Palmer is the only player who was there for them all. He won a game in each of their victorious series \xe2\x80\x94 in 1966, 1970 and 1983 \xe2\x80\x94 and was swiftly inducted to the Hall of Fame.Palmer had eight 20-victory seasons in a nine-year span and won three American League Cy Young Awards. He is a proud member of the last generation of pitchers who worked 300 innings in a season, having done so four times.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I got into the Hall of Fame, I said my biggest fear about baseball is if you pay more for less, that\xe2\x80\x99s probably what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was kind of talking about pitching.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Palmer talks a lot about pitching, and his lifetime of doing it, in a new memoir written with Alan Maimon, \xe2\x80\x9cNine Innings To Success\xe2\x80\x9d (Triumph). The book uses examples from Palmer\xe2\x80\x99s life to illustrate broader points, and its author understands his good fortune in achieving it all.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Palmer arrived in the majors in 1965 in relief of Robin Roberts, a future Hall of Famer who was also a roommate and mentor. He finished the next season by throwing a shutout in the World Series at Dodger Stadium, beating one of his heroes, Sandy Koufax, in the last game of Koufax\xe2\x80\x99s career.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cI go up there and Koufax throws me the first high fastball \xe2\x80\x94 shooooo,\xe2\x80\x9d Palmer said, mimicking the sound. \xe2\x80\x9cNow he throws me the curveball and it looks the same. The same! And John Roseboro catches it on the ground. And I\xe2\x80\x99m going, this is Sandy Koufax.\xe2\x80\x9dPalmer was describing what turned out to be the last strikeout Koufax ever got. He retired after the World Series, his arm ruined. It is almost forgotten that Palmer was nearly gone, too. He pitched just nine games the next season and blew out his rotator cuff in the minors in 1968.\xe2\x80\x9cI heard everything pop,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like Rice Krispies.\xe2\x80\x9dThat might have been the end. The Orioles were so stumped that they ordered Palmer to have his teeth pulled as a remedy for the shoulder. Palmer passed an exam to become a life-insurance salesman. He was such an afterthought that the Kansas City Royals and the Seattle Pilots passed on him in the expansion draft.\xe2\x80\x9cMark Trumbo asked me, \xe2\x80\x98How did guys deal with Tommy John surgery, ligament problems and all that?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Palmer said, referring to the Orioles outfielder. \xe2\x80\x9cI said they had a sore elbow and nobody really knew why. Some got better, some didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Palmer was one of the lucky ones. One night in December 1968, at a Baltimore Bullets basketball game, a friend who worked for a drug company listened to Palmer describe his problems. The friend, Marv Foxman, left at halftime, went to his car and brought Palmer a brown paper bag filled with pills of Indocin, a nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory pain reliever.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Palmer took them as Foxman instructed, went to winter ball in Puerto Rico and found his 96-mile-an-hour fastball again. Just like that, he was on his way, a hard thrower with remarkable durability who would be baseball\xe2\x80\x99s biggest winner (186 victories) in the 1970s.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Pitchers then, Palmer said, were not necessarily better than those today. The difference is the standards. He loved pitching when he did, largely for the challenge of working deep into games, the way Roberts had before him.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you did, because you could do it,\xe2\x80\x9d Palmer said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou really learn a lot about yourself. It takes guile, intelligence, conditioning, guts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  One pitcher, he said, stands out today \xe2\x80\x94 not only for his talent, but, it seems to Palmer, for his drive to go further than most: the Dodgers\xe2\x80\x99 Clayton Kershaw, who pitches at the same park where Palmer beat Koufax nearly 50 years ago. The game he analyzes has changed from the one he played, but Palmer is eager to see the modern master in July.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never met him, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to meet him this year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re playing out at Dodger Stadium.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mr. VersatilityOne of the more impressive parts of Kris Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s early career has been his willingness to play multiple positions. Last season, when he was the National League rookie of the year for the Chicago Cubs, Bryant played mostly at third base, appearing in the outfield only 19 times. Now, he rarely stays in one spot very long.Bryant has gone more than a month since he played more than three games in a row at one \xe2\x80\x94 and only one \xe2\x80\x94 position. From April 15 through 19, he played just third base. Since then, Bryant has bounced among third, left field, right field and even first base (for one out). He has played multiple positions in about a third of his games.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s so many guys in this clubhouse that might play a certain area, and I might need to make a sacrifice and move somewhere else for them if they\xe2\x80\x99re swinging the bat hot,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant said at Wrigley Field recently. \xe2\x80\x9cAt first, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard to prepare yourself each day, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a change of scenery. You\xe2\x80\x99re in left field, right field, third base \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s different. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m a little more used to it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s versatility has allowed Manager Joe Maddon to rotate Javier Baez and Tommy La Stella into the lineup at third base. Without a designated hitter spot in the N.L., Maddon said, outfield days give Bryant \xe2\x80\x9calmost like a day off\xe2\x80\x9d compared to the physical demands of third base. Staying sharp mentally in the outfield can be a challenge.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cPlaying the outfield is a little different in terms of my offensive side, because you have more time to think about it out there, which can be a good thing or a bad thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this year, so far, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made it a good thing, because last year, when I was playing the outfield, I was thinking a lot about my at-bats. This year, I\xe2\x80\x99m a little more focused on the whole defensive side of things.\xe2\x80\x9dBryant\xe2\x80\x99s statistics are essentially the same at third base or the outfield, and he has worked at the plate to improve one offensive trait in particular.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cMaking more contact,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be above average in terms of my strikeout numbers, but if I could just cut down on that a couple of percentage points, it can only help me.\xe2\x80\x9dAfter leading the N.L. in strikeouts last season, with 199, Bryant had just 40 coming into the weekend. He struck out in 30.6 of his plate appearances last season and had cut that rate to 19.6, helping the Cubs to the majors\xe2\x80\x99 best record.Honoring GwynnA regrettable fashion trend in baseball, going back more than 20 years, is the way most players wear their pants: pulled down to their shoe tops, with no stirrups or socks showing.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been like that for a while,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jon Jay, an outfielder for the San Diego Padres. \xe2\x80\x9cBut guys wear different stuff underneath.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  For Jay \xe2\x80\x94 for every game \xe2\x80\x94 that means socks depicting Tony Gwynn, the Hall of Famer who spent 20 seasons with the Padres through 2001. The socks are in the classic Padres colors \xe2\x80\x94 yellow, brown and orange \xe2\x80\x94 that Gwynn wore early in his career.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cGrowing up, he was the best hitter around,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jay, like Gwynn a left-handed hitter. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always had a swing that went to left field, and he always hit that 6-hole \xe2\x80\x94 that was his patented move. I remember just always admiring his swing and the way he could hit the ball to all parts of the ballpark.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Jay chose No. 19 with his previous team, the St. Louis Cardinals, partly because of Gwynn. Since coming to the Padres, he said, he has learned more about Gwynn, including his reliance on video to prepare for games.\xe2\x80\x9cMike Tompkins, our video guy, was around him, and I asked him a ton of questions about Tony,\xe2\x80\x9d Jay said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe revolutionized it.\xe2\x80\x9dJay has met Tony Gwynn Jr., but he never met Gwynn, who died of salivary gland cancer in 2014. Gwynn\xe2\x80\x99s family filed a wrongful-death lawsuit Monday against Altria Group, Inc., the tobacco giant formerly known as Philip Morris, and several other defendants involved in inducing Gwynn to begin using smokeless tobacco, or dip, at San Diego State in the 1970s.

05/30/2016,"[(""Baltimore Orioles: What a day for Darren O'Day!"", ""The Baltimore Orioles and their fans got a stark reminder of why the team re-signed Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day yesterday afternoon in a 6-4 win at Cleveland.Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day reminded the Baltimore Orioles yesterday afternoon why they brought him back on a new deal in 2016. You have to have a cool head in order to be a successful reliever, because often times you\xe2\x80\x99re coming into games in big spots. And yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re expected to deliver. And boy did O\xe2\x80\x99Day do that yesterday.Chris Tillman gave one of those \xe2\x80\x9cin between\xe2\x80\x9d starts yesterday. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.0 IP, 4 H, 4 R, 3 BB, 3 K. His fastball had the usual zip, but some of his breaking pitches didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite have the usual finish yesterday. However I\xe2\x80\x99ve always said that it\xe2\x80\x99s those starts where you aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily on your A-game (but not a disaster either) where the success or failure of your season lie. Tillman battled through, and was able to qualify for the win.The Birds jumped on Cleveland early, loading the bases in the first inning.\xc2\xa0Mark Trumbo came to the plate and promptly cleared the bases with a three-RBI double. That set the tone early that the O\xe2\x80\x99s were looking to get out of Cleveland with a series win.\xc2\xa0Live Feed darren o'dayBaltimore Orioles: Analyzing losses reveals an even bigger story The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles and starting pitching, a familiar refrain The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: One-run games are quite alright in Birdland The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Does Orioles' bullpen reign supreme in 2017 AL East rankings?

That cut the lead to 4-3, and the Birds went into \xe2\x80\x9cprotect mode.\xe2\x80\x9d Cleveland tied the game and took control of the momentum in the last of the sixth with a solo homer by Kipnis.However the O\xe2\x80\x99s weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be out-slugged. All that talk in Houston about playing small ball and Houston then beating the Birds with experience?

He entered the game in a tough spot \xe2\x80\x93 runners at the corners with nobody out. The O\xe2\x80\x99s played the infield in to try to cut a run down at home plate, however O\xe2\x80\x99Day induced Napoli to ground out to third and the runner couldn\xe2\x80\x99t score. He then IBB\xe2\x80\x99d a hitter, and Cleveland brought up Chisenhall as a pinch-hitter\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and what an epic at-bat that was. The count ran full and Chisenhall fouled pitches off left and right \xe2\x80\x93 the at-bat was nine pitches to be exact. O\xe2\x80\x99Day threw everything he had at Chisenhall, however he always was able to nic or tap the ball.

And manager\xc2\xa0Buck Showalter said as much after the game (quote courtesy of Jordan Bastian, MLB.com):Chisenhall\xe2\x80\x99s had some luck against him. I like Darren against anyone, but it was cat and mouse. That was a gutsy pitch to throw the back door breaking ball. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to get hitters out, especially as good of an offense as they are. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we are not playing them again for a while.So while the story of the day in some senses was Kim\xe2\x80\x99s homer, in my view it\xe2\x80\x99s Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day who rules the roost for this game. Kim\xe2\x80\x99s homer was big for sure, but what O\xe2\x80\x99Day did was huge. I suspect that if that\xe2\x80\x99s any other reliever in baseball right now, he either walks in a run or gives up a base hit which ultiately surrenders the lead.The Orioles now return home to open up a homestand with a Memorial Day matinee against Boston.

The Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles are battling for the top spot in an American League East Division that is getting tighter by the week. The Red Sox will try to maintain their slim one-game edge over the Orioles when they visit Baltimore on Monday in the opener of a four-game series. Boston is suddenly trying to answer some questions about its bullpen after it gave up late runs in all three games over the weekend in Toronto. The Red Sox dropped the first two and squandered a 3-2 lead in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s contest before pulling out a 5-3 win in 11 innings when Dustin Pedroia drove in the go-ahead run with a ground-rule double. The Orioles went into the weekend riding a four-game losing streak but managed to take two out of three in Cleveland to finish up the nine-game road trip with a 4-5 mark. Baltimore let a 4-0 lead slip away in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s finale against the Indians but outfielder Hyun Soo Kim belted his first career home run in the seventh to snap the tie and Nolan Reimold added another in the ninth inning for a 6-4 win. PITCHING MATCHUP: Red Sox RH Steven Wright (4-4, 2.52 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Tyler Wilson (2-3, 3.80) Wright is the most reliable member of the Boston starting rotation at this point and is coming off two consecutive strong starts. The knuckleballer baffled the Colorado Rockies on Wednesday and struck out seven while allowing three runs \xe2\x80\x93 two earned \xe2\x80\x93 on seven hits in as many innings to earn a win. Wright is making his first start against the Orioles and owns a 1.73 ERA in five road outings this season. Wilson is trying to bounce back after a pair of losses to Seattle and Houston. The 26-year-old Virginia native surrendered a pair of home runs at Houston on Wednesday and was charged with four runs \xe2\x80\x93 three earned \xe2\x80\x93 on six hits in six innings. Wilson tossed three scoreless innings of relief at Boston on April 13 in his lone previous appearance against the Red Sox. WALK-OFFS 1. Red Sox DH David Ortiz (sore left foot) was scratched from Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s lineup and is day-to-day. 2. Baltimore RF Mark Trumbo recorded six RBIs and five extra-base hits \xe2\x80\x93 two home runs \xe2\x80\x93 in the last four games. 3. Boston SS Xander Bogaerts has hit safely in 22 straight games.

05/31/2016,"[('The Orioles bench players have been terrible. Can it get ...', ' There is a reason why these guys are not in the starting lineup most days. Whether it\'s because of their struggles with the bat, or that they have issues in the field, something keeps them from being regular players, but the Orioles bench has been especially terrible in 2016.    This is based on the situation right now! Hyun-soo Kim looks to be the regular left fielder for the time being. Nolan Reimold should be the first choice in right field with Mark Trumbo DHing. And Ryan Flaherty starts at third base while J.J. Hardy recovers from injury. Here is the current bench: Caleb Joseph: .175/.235/.206, 0 HR, 0 RBI, 5 BB, 14 SO, -0.4 WAR Joseph has been really bad. The season is more than a quarter over and he still doesn\'t have a single RBI. That doesn\'t seem possible given the fact that he and Matt Wieters basically shared catching duties 50/50 up until just recently. Another issue for him has been the big time struggles of Ubaldo Jimenez. Joseph has served as Jimenez\'s ""personal catcher"" of sorts, but the right-handed starter has been one of the worst pitchers in baseball (2-6, 6.36 ERA, 66 ERA+, 1.873 FIP). Does he really merit having his own catcher?    Joey Rickard: .247/.307/.356, 4 HR, 11 RBI, 15 BB, 39 SO, -0.6 WAR Rickard-mania has subsided in a big way. With the bat, the O\'s Rule 5 pick has been OK. He has provided a bit more power than most would expect from that wiry frame, but he doesn\'t get on base enough to continue on as the regular lead-off man. With the current preference of manager Buck Showalter looking to be Hyun-soo Kim in left field, Joey Baseball may move down the order.    His biggest problem is something that was talked up as a strong point in Spring Training: defense. Between all three outfield positions, Rickard has a combined UZR of -8.9. That is pretty remarkably terrible. His arm has a -2.6 rating while his range gets a -6.9. Ugh. Paul Janish: .071/.188/.071, 0 HR, 0 RBI, 2 BB, 2 SO, -0.2 WAR What can you really say? The moment J.J. Hardy returns from his foot injury, Janish will be out the door. The 33-year-old\'s defense is serviceable but he is basically an automatic out at the plate    Pedro Alvarez: .194/.294/.350, 3 HR, 11 RBI, 15 BB, 27 SO, -0.6 WAR The former Pirate may be the biggest disappointment of the season. He came to Baltimore with the expectation of adding a plentiful number of DONGS to the O\'s already impressively powerful lineup. But he has not done that so far. The batting average was always going to be low, but under .200? His walk-to-strikeout ratio has been a pleasant surprise, but has not made up for the low slugging percentage. And Alvarez is not a good fielder so if he isn\'t hitting, there is no reason for him to play Any relief from the minors? If we go based on the Norfolk Tides record (17-34) then it seems pretty clear that the team is struggling as a whole. There aren\'t too many guys pushing for spots at the big league level.    One exception may be catcher Audry Perez. The backstop is hitting .327 over 30 games. He is 27 years old and played three games with the St. Louis Cardinals a couple seasons back. The scouting report on him is that he is a decent hitter and an average fielder. Is he good enough to replace Joseph? That is a tough one. Showalter seems to have an affinity for Joseph and the catcher has become a fan favorite.  Xavier Avery looked to be on the original Opening Day roster. He was the last player re-assigned to the minor leagues prior to the beginning of the season. If Kim had accepted the demotion, Avery could be seeing some time in Baltimore. The former top prospect offers speed (9-for-10 stolen bases), an ability to get on base a little bit (.333 career minors OBP), and MLB experience. But the corner outfield positions are in a logjam right now.  Adding to that in the future could be Mike Yastrzemski, who is loving life early on in Virginia. Through 13 games, he is hitting .333 with two home runs and seven RBI as a Tide. He profiles as a fourth outfielder-type anyway, so he could work as a bench player. But a September call-up seems more likely than a mid-summer promotion. Since Rickard cannot be sent down this season and, for the moment, Kim is hitting (and has refused a demotion in the past) it seems as though Yaz will need to wait until the end of season to make his MLB debut. Then there is the gaggle of veteran names you have heard a million times already: Henry Urrutia, Dariel Alvarez, L.J. Hoes and Michael Almanzar. Alvarez has been the best of the bunch as he is slashing .274/.301/.360 with just one home run. Those numbers don\'t exactly bust down the major league door. But the other three have been downright bad. Urrutia was demoted to double-A Bowie recently. Hoes is hitting .213 and Almanzar is not much better at .217. And, of course, the ""prospects"". These are guys like Trey Mancini, Chance Sisco and Christian Walker. Sisco is doing well enough with the Baysox, slashing .306/.404/.373. He is still just 21 years old. Mancini was killing it with Bowie (.302/.413/.698, seven home runs) but has had some slight growing pains in Norfolk (.252/.331/.433, four home runs). And Walker has continued his nosedive in performance that has followed him each of the past three seasons. In 2016, his batting average is down to .235 and he has an OBP of just .295. Of those three, Mancini is the closest to being ready, but he doesn\'t fit on the roster apart from a DH.     Going forward No major league bench is going to be perfect. But the current iteration of the Orioles reserves is a confusing one to have. Typically, you want those guys to have some specific tool that makes them useful. Rickard can hit lefties pretty well (.286 BA), but not necessarily better than Reimold or Kim. Alvarez has power, but hasn\'t showed it. Janish is a fine fielder, but not more reliable than Ryan Flaherty or Manny Machado. We know Joseph can do a job behind the plate, but his bat is so bad right now that it makes him tough to play. Who knows what the answer is to the Baltimore bench quandry? Certainly not me. But it is a problem. Good teams don\'t have their reserves filled with players that are a drain on the rest of the roster. Teams must have substitutes to fill in for the starters in situations where they struggle. Showalter can\'t rely on the same nine or 10 guys for 162 games. If somehow they manage to get to the playoffs, they may not go far. The Maryland summers are hot and muggy and awful, really. Tired legs will lead to poor play.

The Boston Red Sox came into Baltimore with a chance to put some distance between themselves and the rest of the American League East and took a step toward accomplishing that goal in the series opener. The Red Sox will try to make it two in a row over the Orioles and push the gap to three games in the division when they visit Baltimore for the second of a four-game set on Tuesday. Boston beat the Orioles at their own game in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s opener, slugging three home runs in the sixth inning or later to turn a tight game into a 7-2 rout. The Red Sox had some trouble getting outs late in games while dropping two of three in Toronto over the weekend but managed to get the bullpen an extra day of rest as Steven Wright tossed his third complete game on Monday. Baltimore is one of the best slugging teams in the majors with 69 home runs but is having trouble pushing runs across over the last week-plus. The Orioles are 2-6 in their last eight games and are averaging 2.5 runs in those six setbacks. PITCHING MATCHUP: Red Sox LH Eduardo Rodriguez (2015: 10-6, 3.85 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (0-2, 3.24) Rodriguez was a shoo-in for a rotation spot before going down with a knee injury in spring training, and his return prompted the team to push Clay Buchholz to the bullpen. The 23-year-old Venezuelan surrendered three or fewer earned runs in 17 of his 21 starts during his 2015 rookie campaign. Rodriguez, who was acquired from Baltimore in a trade for Andrew Miller in 2014, struggled against his original organization with an 0-2 mark and a 4.20 ERA in three starts. Gausman has yet to earn a win in seven starts this season and struggled through five innings at Houston on Thursday. The LSU product was ripped for three home runs \xe2\x80\x93 matching his total from the first six starts \xe2\x80\x93 and charged with four runs on five hits and one walk. Gausman has made 10 career appearances \xe2\x80\x93 five starts \xe2\x80\x93 against the Red Sox and owns a 2-1 record with a 3.12 ERA and 36 strikeouts in 34 2/3 total innings. WALK-OFFS 1.

Baltimore Orioles defeated Boston Red Sox 13-9. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles prevailed 13-9 over the Red Sox on Wednesday night in one of the more unusual games one will ever see.The final score, along with all of the home runs, hits, and walks, had the look of a beer league softball game rather than a professional baseball game. Also, a ground ball with the bases through the legs of a certain diminutive second baseman added to the same appearance. That was special!Boston hit a total of five home runs. How often does a team give up five homers and still win the game? When is the last time the O\xe2\x80\x99s have done this? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, though the answer may appear somewhere in other media coverage of the game. But it is exceedingly rare to have this happen.Along with five home runs, Orioles pitchers allowed a total of 15 hits and five walks. And even though the only extra base hits by the O\xe2\x80\x99s were four doubles, they did pound out 14 hits of their own along with nine bases on balls (including four to Chris Davis). If you calculate the total on-base percentage of both teams, it was .478.\xe2\x80\x9cOur guys just refused to be outscored tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buck Showalter in the postgame press conference.This sort of game is what the Baltimore fanbase feared was going to be the type that would be repeated over and over this season. The pitching would be poor and the Orioles power hitters and total offensive muscle would have to simply outscore the opposition. This is only the fifth time in 51 games that the Orioles have won by needing to score more than five runs. A total of 11 losses have been in games where the opposition has scored five or more runs.At this point of the season, just shy of one-third of the way through it, the Orioles have been held to two or less runs on 16 occasions. By comparison, this happened 18 times in 2015 in the same number of games and 51 times over the course of the whole season. So the current Birds are on about the same pace, though we thought this team would be a better-scoring outfit. It may yet happen.Getting three hits apiece for the Orioles were Pedro Alvarez and Hyun Soo Kim. For Alvarez, this was the second occasion of doing this, the other being against the White Sox on April 30th. For Kim, this was his third three-hit game amongst his 14 starts this season.

""Get good pitches to hit and drive them out the park.""Boston\'s Xander Bogaerts extended his career-high hitting streak to 26 games with a two-run double and David Ortiz hit his 16th homer to give the Red Sox a temporary 5-4 lead in the sixth.Quite simply, Boston couldn\'t score enough to keep up with Baltimore\'s hit parade. The Red Sox tied a team record by giving up seven home runs.""A lot of offense with both teams scoring a lot of runs. We just came up short today,"" Bogaerts said. ""Hopefully, we just continue to swing the bats and the pitching will take care of itself.""The Orioles hit their most homers in a game since connecting eight times last June 16 against Philadelphia.Trumbo put Baltimore up 2-0 in the fourth inning, Jones added a two-run drive in the fifth.

""Yet, the inability to locate consistently is the difference in the last two ball games, compared to the first two of the series.""Mychal Givens (4-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the Orioles, who next host the AL East rival Yankees for three games.Jimenez came into the game looking to solidify his tenuous hold on a spot in Baltimore\'s starting rotation after allowing 15 runs in his previous three outings.The right-hander retired the first eight batters and yielded only one hit through five innings before running into a whole lot of trouble in the sixth.A single, a double and a walk loaded the bases for Bogaerts, who doubled off the center-field wall. Ortiz followed with a three-run shot into the right-field stands.""They just came out swinging,"" Jimenez said. ""They hit pretty much everything I threw. I threw a couple fastballs up. In the first five innings, everything was down.

The New York Yankees finally showed signs of breaking out of their offensive slumber, and the timing couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be better as they visit the Baltimore Orioles on Friday for the opener of their three-game series. It\xe2\x80\x99s the final stop on a 10-game road trip for New York, which snapped its three-game losing streak with a 5-4 victory at Detroit on Thursday. Recent callup Rob Refsnyder collected a pair of hits with an RBI and two runs scored as the Yankees matched their run total from their previous four games combined. They may need the offense to keep up with the Orioles, who salvaged a split of a four-game series with American East-leading Boston by scoring 25 runs over the last two contests to close within one game of the Red Sox. Mark Trumbo blasted a pair of homers Thursday to earn a share of the major-league lead with 17 while Adam Jones added a pair of shots and is 6-for-15 over his last three games. New York\xe2\x80\x99s Nathan Eovaldi looks to win his sixth straight start as he opposes Chris Tillman, who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost since April 14. PITCHING MATCHUP: Yankees RH Nathan Eovaldi (6-2, 3.71 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Chris Tillman (7-1, 2.92) Eovaldi ran his winning streak to five in somewhat miraculous fashion last time out, allowing one run over six innings and earning the victory despite the Yankees managing only one hit. The 26-year-old has permitted a total of seven runs during his winning streak, although he has failed to go beyond six frames in each of his last four turns. Eovaldi has made three career starts against the Orioles, logging a 1-0 record and 3.86 ERA. Tillman stretched his unbeaten streak to eight starts after allowing four runs and four hits \xe2\x80\x93 three homers \xe2\x80\x93 over six innings at Cleveland on Sunday. It marked the first time Tillman yielded more than three earned runs since his lone defeat in mid-April and the fifth time in six turns that he has walked at last three batters. He pitched seven innings of one-run ball versus the Yankees on May 3 to improve to 7-6 with a 4.68 ERA against them. \x7fWALK-OFFS 1. Orioles SS Manny Machado has recorded five RBIs in the last two games and has hit safely in nine of his last 10 contests. 2. Yankees CF Jacoby Ellsbury drove in three runs Thursday to end his eight-game RBI drought. 3. Baltimore sent RHP Mike Wright to Triple-A Norfolk and promoted LHP Brian Duensing.

The velocity was not great at any point, command was poor, and late movement was not seen on a majority of pitches.The perspective I am sharing here would likely be scoffed at by the folks referenced above (were they to read this, which is unlikely), as this writer would be seen as what they sometimes call \xe2\x80\x9cother media types.\xe2\x80\x9d Beyond that, it is likely that they would simply see this perspective as more of the \xe2\x80\x9cDebbie Downer\xe2\x80\x9d pessimism of so many fans who overreact critically to anything and everything that goes wrong.To the former criticism, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what I could present to gain their respect as a credentialed baseball analyst. Oh well. And to the latter, I\xe2\x80\x99ve more often been accused over the years of writing as too much of a fan and not enough of an objective analyst. I plead guilty to both. I want to see all Orioles players excel, and I have nothing against Gallardo; yet I think I have decades of watching and playing this sport that gives me a legit eye for what is or is not happening.The line being used about this rehab outing is that the Frederick defense was porous and that the three innings with three runs on seven hits and two walks is just not as bad as it seems on paper. Further, it is being said that balls just found holes.I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. They found holes because they were hit hard. And though the defense could have been better and is not to be confused with what is on the field in Baltimore, it would not have changed the nature of this pitching effort. It simply was not very good.Failing to hold Potomac\xe2\x80\x99s leadoff hitter Andrew Stevenson (who singled in each of the first two innings), the center fielder twice swiped second base. Frederick catcher Jonah Heim on both occasions made great throws to almost salvage the outs. This contributed to running up the pitch count.Gallardo got in his work of 59 pitches, though in three innings instead of the hoped-for number of four frames. He\xe2\x80\x99ll need to pitch at least once more before a possible call-up, and maybe several more occasions. Perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99ll make tweaks and rapid improvements; that is possible and is something he has done before.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles rumors: Manny Machado\'s price tag ""may get into ...', ' No one really wants to spend a whole lot of time thinking about it, but Manny Machado\'s time with the Orioles could run to its end a lot sooner than any of us would like it to.     Absent a contract extension, his free agency is still more than two years away. On the other hand, unless he gets a new deal from the Orioles, his free agency is only a little more than two years away. Within the last week, Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports suggested that the price tag for Manny Machado could get into the $400 million range. That\'s a lot of money, and one it\'s rather hard to imagine the Orioles committing to even a player as good as Machado. Added to this anxiety is the frustration of what might have been. MLB Network\'s Jon Heyman, writing yesterday for Today\'s Knuckleball, contributed this tantalizing tidbit: Some time within Machado\'s first two seasons, had ""a seven year deal with Machado that seemed all but done"" but they were not able to finalize the contract extension.    Although Heyman does not know what exactly caused the deal not to happen, or even what might have been the precise terms of the contract, he reiterates that it is said to have been ""on the cusp of reality.""    It\'s unfortunate that they weren\'t able to work out whatever they were talking about at that time. Still, realistically, a deal in Machado\'s rookie year of 2012, when he still had six full years of team control awaiting, would only have added one year to what the O\'s already have of Machado. If that talk came in 2013, his first full year, it would have added two years. O\'s fans would surely take the extra two years over zero additional years, though that would still leave the O\'s eventually facing a Machado mega-contract that would probably exceed their price range. If you\'d like Machado to be the next great career-long Oriole, there\'s going to be disappointment eventually.    Looking for a reason to hope The best that can be hoped for is that the idea that Machado\'s departure could be inevitable is less certain than Heyman makes it seem to be. This could be a fool\'s hope for all of us, or perhaps the desperate man hanging on a cliffside, grasping for the only weak root he can reach, knowing it will break and he will fall to a gruesome death on the rocks. Heyman is way more plugged in to the baseball rumor mill than I am. But it\'s worth noting that there are a couple of things about his column that might cause some question about some of his assertions about the Orioles. Here\'s a sentence from the column about Joey Rickard:    Joey Rickard looks like a steal. \xe2\x80\x9cEasily the best Rule 5 pickup of the year,\xe2\x80\x9d one scout noted. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how Tampa just let him go.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rickard is actually among the least valuable players in baseball, according to WAR. He is at -0.6 in bWAR and -0.9 in fWAR. That\'s what a .664 OPS corner outfielder who doesn\'t steal many bases who is getting dinged in defensive metrics for both range and arm strength is going to be worth. So if the person who is popping off to Heyman about Machado knows about as much about what\'s going on as whatever scout proclaimed that Rickard ""looks like a steal,"" well. That\'s a judgement you can question. Also, Heyman\'s article has way more to say about Bryce Harper and outlandish hypothetical contract demands in the $500-$750 million range (yes, really) than it does about Machado, who is mentioned almost as an afterthought. There is not any concrete information, or anything more than just a vague rumor, that\'s connected to Machado. There\'s no getting around the fact that as things stand right now, it\'ll surely cost a lot of money to secure Machado\'s services long term. That\'s undeniable reality whatever Heyman or any other baseball writer happens to write about it. Machado is young and very good - a 23-year-old MVP candidate in his fifth big league season.    If we\'re lucky, it\'s not as bad as all that as far as the O\'s chances of retaining Machado. They opened up the checkbook to keep Chris Davis, after all, and they do not have many payroll commitments going on in the years when Machado would be making mega-bucks. At least Machado\'s free agency is still more than two years away. Wait. Machado\'s free agency is only a bit more than two years away. Ahhhh!

During the first face-off, the Orioles took two out of three from the Yankees. Neither team is playing all that well this time around, so we may be in store for some ugly baseball.    New York\'s struggles have come mostly on the road, where they have a record of 11-16. Meanwhile, the Birds are pretty good at home, boasting an 18-10 record from the cozy confines.  When it comes to pitching, the two squads are in a similar position. Overall, the O\'s staff has a 4.01 ERA; the Yanks are a touch worse at 4.15. The rotation is where both clubs struggle. The visitors starters have a 4.40 ERA and the hosts have more issues with a 4.78 ERA. In the bullpen, the Birds have a distinct advantage. Their relievers rep a group ERA of 2.75 (3rd-best in MLB) where as the pinstripers are nearly a whole run higher (3.72 ERA). Offensively, the Yankees are struggling big time. Their 193 runs scored are the worst in the American League. They are also the worst in the AL in batting average (.231), on-base percentage (.299) and slugging percentage (.371). Something good: they have struck out the fourth fewest times in baseball. So, there\'s that.    Game 1: Friday, June 3, 7:05 p.m., MASN RHP Nathan Eovaldi (6-2, 3.71 ERA) vs. RHP Chris Tillman (7-1, 2.92 ERA) The Orioles have been a OK team for Eovaldi to face over the last few years. He has made three starts against Baltimore and sits with a record of 1-0 and a 3.86 ERA over 16.1 innings. He is yet to get through six innings against them but has also never allowed more than three runs.             Daily Baseball Data   Tillman has had a tough time facing the Yanks. Over 17 starts he is 7-6 with a 4.68 ERA and a batting average against of .296. That is the highest BAA of any team that Tillman has faced more than twice in his career. However, he pitched against them in May and was fantastic, tossing seven innings and allowing just one run while striking out nine and walking four.         Daily Baseball Data   Game 2: Saturday, June 4, 7:15 p.m., FOX RHP Ivan Nova (3-3, 3.98 ERA) vs. RHP Tyler Wilson (2-4, 3.83 ERA) Nova has two mediocre starts back-to-back, allowing eight runs over his last 12.2 innings on the mound; both games were against Toronto. It does not look like it will get easier as he is set to face the Orioles, who he has a 5.07 ERA against lifetime. Over 15 games, including 14 starts, he is 6-4. Baltimore hitters are slashing .273/.326/.471 against him with 14 home runs over 94.0 innings.            Daily Baseball Data   Each start he has, the more I believe in Wilson. The 26-year-old has lost three consecutive games, allowing 11 runs over his past 18.2 innings, but he always seems to keep the team within striking distance. In May he took on the Yankees and put in a ""quality start"" as he allowed two earn runs over six innings. Not bad.         Daily Baseball Data   Game 3: Sunday, June 5, 1:35 p.m., MASN LHP CC Sabathia (2-4, 2.85 ERA) vs. RHP Kevin Gausman (0-3, 3.78 ERA) Who is this left-hander and what has he done with the 2015-version of Sabathia? The chunky southpaw has been genuinely good this year as he has a 146 ERA+ and 3.18 FIP. Not exactly $23 million per year good, but still good. Sabathia was dominant back in May against the Birds as he threw seven scoreless frames for the win. In his career he is 19-7 with a 3.35 ERA over 34 starts.         Daily Baseball Data   The finest start of Gausman\'s season came against the Bombers last month as he went eight innings, struck out four and allowed only three hits while not giving up any walks or runs. But recently his form has dipped. Over the past two starts against the Red Sox and Astros he has given up nine runs over 11 innings. He has been especially prone to the long ball, allowing six in those games as well. The light-hitting New York lineup could be the perfect cure...we hope.

They had Mark Teixeira, who had a resurgent season last year until it was ended in mid-August by a freak accident, a foul ball off his shin. They also had a worthy young successor in Greg Bird, who coolly slugged 11 home runs in the final seven weeks.Now, the position is threatening to become a sinkhole, one that appears ready to stand as a proxy for the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 season.After losing Bird to season-ending shoulder surgery before the start of spring training, Teixeira plunged into a prolonged slump and on Friday night he left a 6-5 loss to the Baltimore Orioles with an injured right knee.Teixeira exited in the third inning with what was described by the team as \xe2\x80\x9cdiscomfort,\xe2\x80\x9d was examined by an Orioles doctor and sent for a magnetic resonance imaging test.

The struggling offense got three home runs \xe2\x80\x94 from Carlos Beltran, Alex Rodriguez and Austin Romine \xe2\x80\x94 but pitcher Nathan Eovaldi, who had won his last five starts, could not hold a 5-2 lead.

Privacy Policy    At the end of the game it was unclear how serious Teixeira\xe2\x80\x99s injury might be. Though he was hitting .181 with a career-long 142 at-bat homerless streak, the Yankees have few attractive options if his injury requires him to miss an extended period of time.His backup, Dustin Ackley, had season-ending shoulder surgery Friday, and Chris Parmalee and Nick Swisher are at Class-AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, but neither of them was called up to replace Ackley. When Teixeira left the game, he was replaced by Rob Refsnyder, who played the position for the first time Friday.

The Baltimore Orioles look to extend their winning streak to four games when they continue a three-game series with the visiting New York Yankees on Saturday. The Orioles rallied from an early three-run deficit to top the Yankees by a 6-5 margin in the series opener, pulling into a tie with Boston atop the American League East. Mark Trumbo had three hits and Chris Davis slugged his 11th homer to lead the way for Baltimore. The Yankees have lost four of five, are 3-5 on their current 10-game road trip and will turn to right-hander Ivan Nova, who has two of his three career complete games against the Orioles. That might give outfielder Hyun Soo Kim another start for Baltimore after the rookie had three hits Saturday to raise his average to .321 in 21 games this season, virtually all against right-handers. The Orioles counter with Tyler Wilson, who has lost three straight starts. PITCHING MATCHUP: Yankees RH Ivan Nova (3-3, 3.98 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Tyler Wilson (2-4, 3.83) After allowing one run in each of his first three starts, Nova has given up eight runs in 12 2/3 innings over his last two outings. The Dominican is 6-4 but has a 5.07 ERA in 15 career games (four starts) against the Orioles. Davis is 9-for-29 with three homers and 10 RBIs versus Nova. Wilson lasted at least six innings in each of his five starts last May, allowing three earned runs or fewer in four of them. He yielded two earned runs in six frames in a loss to the New York Yankees on May 11 and owns a 1.93 ERA in their previous encounters. The 26-year-old is 0-3 with a 4.12 ERA at home. WALK-OFFS 1. Trumbo is 6-for- 11 with two homers and five RBIs over the course of a three-game hitting streak. 2. The Orioles placed set-up man RHP Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day on the disabled list with a right hamstring strain 3.

After taking two of three from their American League East rivals at home in early May, the Baltimore Orioles look to repeat the feat when they host the New York Yankees on Sunday for the rubber match of their three-game set. Baltimore, which allowed a total of one run in its victories against New York in early May, rallied from a three-run deficit to edge the Yankees 6-5 in the series opener before its rally fell short despite a six-run seventh inning on Saturday in an 8-6 defeat. Starlin Castro appears to be heating up for the Yankees, recording a three-hit performance to improve to 5-for-13 over his last three games after registering only two hits in his previous eight contests. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s three-game winning streak ended with Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s setback, but the team has been on an offensive tear this month while scoring 37 runs over four games. Mark Trumbo entered Saturday with a share of the major-league lead in homers and belted his 18th of the season, giving him three blasts in his last three contests. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 slugger has been held without a hit only twice in his last 11 games, going 15-for-43 with four multi-hit performances in that span. PITCHING MATCHUP: Yankees LH CC Sabathia (3-4, 2.85 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (0-3, 3.78) Sabathia has been solid all season after a disappointing 2015, allowing fewer than four runs in each of his eight starts and a total of five over 26 innings in his last four outings. The 35-year-old Californian has not received any support of late, however, as he gave up two runs in back-to-back hard-luck losses to Toronto while the Yankees scored once in each contest. Sabathia has feasted on the Orioles over his career, going 19-7 overall with a pair of shutouts and a 3.35 ERA in 34 starts \xe2\x80\x93 including an 11-6 record and 3.63 ERA in 21 outings at Camden Yards. Gausman remains in search of his first win of the season as he makes his ninth start \xe2\x80\x93 and second against New York. The 25-year-old native of Colorado has lost two straight outings, surrendering four or more runs in each while serving up three homers in both contests. Gausman is 3-2 with one complete game and a 2.31 ERA in 12 career appearances \xe2\x80\x93 six starts \xe2\x80\x93 versus New York but settled for a no-decision in their meeting on May 5 despite scattering three hits over eight scoreless innings. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles CF Adam Jones became the club\xe2\x80\x99s all-time leader in RBIs at Camden Yards on Saturday, belting a three-run homer to give him 370 and move past Cal Ripken Jr. (368) for the honor. 2. New York placed 1B Mark Teixeira on the 15-day disabled list with torn cartilage in his right knee and recalled INF Chris Parmelee from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. 3. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s starting pitchers have surrendered at least five runs in each of the team\xe2\x80\x99s last five games.

The Orioles won 3-1. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles took two out of three games from the New York Yankees over the weekend, laying two losses upon the NY bullpen.Every win counts the same at the end of 162 games, but we all know that some are better than others. And Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s comeback 3-1 win over the Yankees fits in the \xe2\x80\x9cexcellent\xe2\x80\x9d category. It could have gone the other way. A good, quality start might have been wasted.There were more than a few opportunities for a clutch hit. Two of the best were bases loaded situations for Mark Trumbo, but six pitches total gave Sabathia a pair of clutch strikeouts. Trumbo can look totally lost for two or three games, but then hit five homers in the next three.In the bottom of the eighth inning after a rain delay, with runners on first and second, the Orioles were a combined 0-for-9 at that point. New catcher Francisco Pena (who is now 4-for-7 and loving the major leagues) broke the streak with a single to right field, though not scoring the runner and leaving the Yankees with a 1-0 advantage. The Pena hit was off fireballing Arnoldis Chapman, going triple digits as always.Finally, pinch-hitting Matt Wieters broke through with a two-out, two-strike, two-RBI grounder up the middle as the key hit of the game. On comes our lefty, Zach Britton, who nailed his 17th consecutive save of the season. Baltimore Orioles: first place.Wieters is now hitting .324 with runners in scoring position. The bat has very much come alive for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 catcher. Hitting only .214 in April, he improved to .333 for the month of May. Currently he sits at .287 for the season. Having started 35 of the 55 games so far, we can probably expect that pace to pick up.Both the Yankees and Orioles have strong bullpens. But it was the Baltimore relief corps that came limping into the series just a bit with Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day going to the disabled list.But for the series, the O\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen gave up three runs in 11.1 innings, whereas the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 relievers yielded four runs in 8.2 frames. Beyond that, the Orioles touched up Dellin Betances for the two losses, raising his ERA from 2.81 to 3.54. And Chapman suffered his first blown save.

You can look at Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s stat line and see that he was throwing strikes (too many if anything) \xe2\x80\x93 and that they were being put in play. If those balls don\xe2\x80\x99t find the holes that they did, it\xe2\x80\x99s not an issue. But this is part of baseball, which as we know is a game based on failure.\xc2\xa0Live Feed tyler wilsonBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: What's next for Ubaldo Jim\xc3\xa9nez?

Tack on Refsnyder\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double and Romine\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single, and the Birds were suddenly down 5-0.Of course the pressure was kept on an inning later when Castro ran the score to 6-0 with an RBI-single. In the sixth New York pulled off a play that generall only works in little league, but since everything was working for them to that point they probably figured why not. They pulled off a double-steal, with Ellsbury successfully stealing home plate, and running the score to 7-0.However the good news for the Birds is that they battled back. In fact, they almost took control of the game. Granted it was too little too late, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t totally keep these O\xe2\x80\x99s down. They are in fact a better team than the current New York Yankees, and regardless of for whom anyone follows that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.Mark Trumbo got the O\xe2\x80\x99s on the board in the last of the seventh with a solo home run, which was followed by Wieters of all people legging out an infield single. (As a guy who similar to Wieters runs like the \xe2\x80\x9cQueen Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine myself doing that \xe2\x80\x93 but he did!) That brought\xc2\xa0Pedro Alvarez to the plate and he smacked a two-run homer, cutting the lead to 7-3.The O\xe2\x80\x99s caught NY\xe2\x80\x99s Nova just as he was starting to tire, as he had been great to that point. But New York couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a reliever ready in time, and still with nobody out in the inning Adam Jones came to the plate with two on. And Jones did what Jones does, hitting a three-run home run that put the O\xe2\x80\x99s right back in the swing of things at 7-6. However New York\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen is solid as we know, and they shut the Birds down for the remainder of the game. ARod would add an RBI-single in the ninth, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s fell 8-6.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerJones\xe2\x80\x99 three-run homer also put him in an elite category. It was his 370th RBI, which passes the great\xc2\xa0Cal Ripken Jr. for the most RBI in the history of Camden Yards (Ripken\xe2\x80\x99s mark was 368). Mind you that Ripken also played the first half of his career at Memorial Stadium, but until last night he held that mark. While Jones might have slightly more power, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always felt that the two were very similar hitters in terms of where they put the ball and so forth.When told of the new record after the game, Jones was predictably humble about it, and he gave credit to those around him (quote courtesy of Steve Melewski, MASNsports):I think that is pretty cool. Means I\xe2\x80\x99ve been around here a little bit and have been fortunate to be healthy and play with some really good players over the years. It is a team thing. It is not like I hit home runs to always drive myself in.However at the end of the day, it\xe2\x80\x99s a loss for the Birds. Boston reclaimed first place by virtue of their win yesterday afternoon, however again it\xe2\x80\x99s a long season. The key for the O\xe2\x80\x99s is to take the series, against a NY team which as I said above is inferior to them for all intents and purposes. Sweeping someone is tough, so the goal is to take two-of-three in all of these series\xe2\x80\x99.\xc2\xa0Next: Darren O'Day injury update: no timeline set for returnAnd the O\xe2\x80\x99s will have the chance to do just that later this afternoon in the series finale.\xc2\xa0Kevin Gausman\xc2\xa0will be on the bump for the Orioles, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by NY\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0C.C.

He will meet with the team physician, Dr. Christopher Ahmad, on Monday to determine a course of action.At the moment, the plan is to rest the knee and see if the discomfort subsides enough for Teixeira to return. If not, he will have surgery, which would most likely end his season. Photo       Alex Rodriguez after striking out in the second inning against the Baltimore Orioles.

It\xe2\x80\x99s just really frustrating.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Teixeira, who is supremely confident, was unusually subdued.One of the few times his assertiveness returned was when he was asked if his impending free agency might affect his decision on whether to try to return or to have surgery sooner so he would have time to show prospective employers that he had recovered.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question, but my free agency has nothing to do with this season,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m worried about tomorrow. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do whatever is best to be able to get back this year and help the team win this year.\xe2\x80\x9dLittle has come easy for the Yankees, who hung on for an 8-6 victory on Saturday night after nearly blowing the seven-run lead they held in the seventh inning. They are in fourth place in the American League East, at 26-29, and a turnaround looks as dicey as Teixeira\xe2\x80\x99s recovery.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Throughout this very trying season for the New York Yankees, manager Joe Girardi could at least count on the back end of his bullpen to be consistent.Well, at least until Sunday.Aroldis Chapman blew his first save opportunity as a Yankee after Dellin Betances got himself in a jam, and New York lost 3-1 to the Baltimore Orioles in a game that turned after a lengthy rain delay.Trailing 1-0 in the eighth, Baltimore got runners to first and second with one out against Betances (2-4) when play was halted by heavy downpour. After a delay of 1 hour, 37 minutes, Chapman entered seeking to earn his 10th save in 10 tries.The hard-throwing closer struck out Jonathan Schoop before Fernando Pena singled to load the bases. Pinch-hitter Matt Wieters then fell behind 0-2 before bouncing a 101 mph fastball up the middle, and a third run scored on the play when center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury threw wild to the plate.Baltimore\'s comeback ruined a decent outing by New York starter CC Sabathia, who allowed two hits and a career-high tying six walks over 5 1/3 shutout innings. Kirby Yates and Betances followed before Chapman entered.New York fell to 25-1 when leading after seven innings.""They\'re not going to be perfect. They\'re going to be really, really good,"" Girardi said of the bullpen trio of Betances, Andrew Miller and Chapman.Chapman had been flawless in save situations until this one.""It\'s tough for Chappie to have to come back out after an hour-and-a-half delay,"" Girardi said. ""He got the count where he wanted. Just didn\'t get the ball where he wanted.""The Yankees\' lone run came in the third inning on an RBI single by Alex Rodriguez. They stranded 10 and went 1 for 11 with runners in scoring position.""We had a lot of opportunities but weren\'t able to get the big hit,"" Girardi lamented. ""They got the big hit at the end and that\'s why we lost.""New York dropped two of three to the Orioles to complete a 10-game swing through Tampa Bay, Toronto, Detroit and Baltimore with a 4-6 record.T.J. McFarland (1-1) pitched two scoreless innings in relief of Kevin Gausman and Zach Britton got three straight outs for his 17th save.Until the eighth inning, the Yankees stymied a team that scored 37 runs and hit 11 homers in its previous four games.Miller was unavailable because he pitched two innings on Saturday, so Girardi did what he could with his shortened staff.""CC did his job. We knew we had to get a lot of outs out of Chappie today,"" the manager said. ""It\'s a tough loss.Gausman gave up one run and seven hits in six innings. The right-hander owns a decent 3.52 ERA but is winless in nine starts.Sabathia kept the 1-0 lead intact in the bottom of the third by using three pitches to strike out Mark Trumbo with the bases loaded and two outs.Gausman returned the favor in the fourth, striking out Ellsbury after New York filled the bases with two outs.In the fifth, Trumbo again came to the plate with the bases loaded and two outs. As before, Sabathia struck him out on three pitches.""I was just battling,"" Sabathia said. ""I was just trying to do whatever I could to keep us with that one-run lead.""In the seventh, Betances struck out Manny Machado with two outs and a runner on third.TRAINER\'S ROOMYankees: Brian McCann was back behind the plate after missing three starts with a hyperextended elbow. He entered as a defensive replacement in the ninth inning Saturday for Austin Romine, who tore the nail off his thumb. Romine said Sunday he was sore but ""good to go.""Orioles: SS J.J.

What if his son, Francisco, came to the plate for the Baltimore Orioles with two outs, the bases loaded and the Yankees clinging to a one-run lead?\xe2\x80\x9cI want him to strike out,\xe2\x80\x9d Pena said with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to win. Honestly. I want to win.\xe2\x80\x9dIt was not quite the ninth inning and Francisco Pena did not deliver the winning hit, but he was there in the middle of the winning rally for the Orioles, who scored three times in the bottom of the eighth inning after a long rain delay to beat the Yankees, 3-1, at Camden Yards.After the rain had delayed the game for 1 hour 37 minutes, Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman came on with runners at first and second and quickly struck out Jonathan Schoop for the second out. But Pena rifled a single to right field hit so hard that it prevented the lead runner, Mark Trumbo, from trying to score \xe2\x80\x94 even after right fielder Aaron Hicks bobbled the ball.

Chapman was not backing up home.

After the loss, the elder Pena was disappointed, but he also surely had some paternal pride.Francisco, a catcher like his father, said he caught his father\xe2\x80\x99s eye once during the game. After chasing down a ball that had skittered away, he glanced toward the first-base coaching box. He also stepped into the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box once and asked McCann, one of many Yankees he knows, if he might do him a favor and call for a fastball.\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was in A-ball, AA, used to go to Yankee Stadium on my day off, so I know all those guys,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pena, 26, who signed with the Mets as a 17-year-old and made his major league debut last year for Kansas City. \xe2\x80\x9cI was messing around with McCann.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Sabathia walked six and hit a batter in five solid innings, but he managed to keep the Orioles scoreless amid muggy, 80-degree conditions.

He is bigger than his father, at 6 feet 2 inches and 230 pounds, and he displayed a rare sign of exuberance on Sunday when he applauded pitcher Kevin Gausman for a high fastball he threw Ellsbury with the bases loaded in the fourth. Gausman eventually struck Ellsbury out.Tony Pena, who averaged just over six walks for every 100 plate appearances in his 18-year career, said his son had a similar approach at the plate: \xe2\x80\x9cHis strike zone is from the head to the toe. If he throws the rosin bag, he might swing.\xe2\x80\x9dPena\xe2\x80\x99s remark was a spot-on scouting report when the younger Pena fouled off five two-strike pitches and coaxed an 11-pitch walk in his first at-bat.

06/08/2016,"[('Manny Machado Only Hurts Orioles By Brawling', ""Manny Machado got into his second\xc2\xa0huge brawl last night and for the Orioles sake, it better be his last one.\xc2\xa0Baltimore Orioles\xc2\xa0third baseman Manny Machado is an extremely competitive and talented player. Machado plays with a huge chip on shoulder, which allows him to play like he\xe2\x80\x99s always trying to prove somebody wrong. Combined with athleticism that is matched by few, if any, in baseball, that makes Machado an incredibly valuable player. That is precisely why he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever put himself in a situation to be suspended.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerFor the record, I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame Machado for his actions against Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura. Ventura went after him three times. During Machado\xe2\x80\x99s second at bat on Tuesday night, Ventura went against what he told catcher Salvador Perez he was going to do twice by throwing inside against him. Factor in Ventura\xe2\x80\x99s reputation and the fact that he had average control at best during the game and the 99 MPH pitch to Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s back was the straw that broke the camel\xe2\x80\x99s back. Manny did nothing to justify that pitch to his back. No amount of trash talk justifies putting a hitter in that situation.At that point, the human body\xc2\xa0loses any sense of rational thought and adrenaline takes over. As a competitor, I know that and therefore, I can\xe2\x80\x99t fault Machado for what he did. Many players likely would have done the same thing. After that pitch to the back, anything short of Machado channeling Juan Marichal on Ventura was a deserved reaction.

Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal11w agoHowever, this needs to be the last time that Machado puts himself in a situation where he can be suspended. He is much too valuable to lose as arguably the best player in baseball. Ventura played mind games with Machado and Machado gave him the reaction that he was looking for.So who really won the battle? Not the Orioles, who will be without Machado for at least five games. The Royals could lose Ventura for 30 games and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really hurt them. Losing Machado clearly hurts the Orioles.Worst of all, Machado put himself in a position where he could have been seriously injured. Granted, Ventura throwing at him three times also put him in a situation where he could have been seriously injured had Ventura missed even slightly with his pitches. However, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t justify charging the mound, an action where a busted jaw or nose are just two of the injuries that could happen..theiaPostSlider_nav._lower{display:none !important}must read: Machado Interested In Long-Term DealWhat\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating is that Machado should have known better. If he\xc2\xa0just jogs to first base, the entire brawl doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. It would have proven that Machado is the bigger man and would have been the equivalent of telling Ventura that he\xe2\x80\x99s not even worth the energy to care about. It\xe2\x80\x99s why stars in hockey rarely fight \xe2\x80\x93 they know their team can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose them for five minutes. While Manny Machado isn\xe2\x80\x99t at fault for the Brawl, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t absolved from responsibility as well.\xc2\xa0oriolesCall to the Pen 2dCurt Schilling Continues to be an EmbarrassmentMore headlines around FanSided:2d - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday2d - Fantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL2d - Boston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado2d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton will return to DL with same forearm issue4d - Baltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red SoxMore News at Birds Watcher  One good thing came from Machado\xe2\x80\x99s actions (other than three home runs). After the game, Machado accepted responsibility for his actions. In 2014 when he threw his bat, it seemed forced when he did so. On Tuesday night, it appeared that he realized the true magnitude of charging the mound. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t duck like Ventura did and answered every question that he faced. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\xc2\xa0sign of a mature adult.Manny Machado has grown from being an immature kid in 2014 to being a grown man in 2016. Humans make mistakes. With few exceptions, those mistakes don\xe2\x80\x99t define us because humans are flawed. How we respond to those mistakes that we make defines who we are. Machado handled the situation well.In a vacuum, it was awesome to see Manny Machado stand up for himself. Buck Showalter and the rest of his team having his back is a microcosm of the brotherhood that the Orioles have. That brotherhood is why they are more than just the sum of the talent of 25 players. Showalter saying that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any issue with Machado\xe2\x80\x99s response was awesome and it\xe2\x80\x99s why Orioles fans love Buck so much.Next: Orioles win brawl, game against RoyalsManny Machado can\xe2\x80\x99t ever do this kind of thing again. Hopefully this serves as a learning experience for him just like the 2014 bat incident did because Manny Machado is far too valuable a player to lose, even for one game. He is better than he was on Tuesday night. Hopefully he proves that moving forward because with two isolated incidents on his record, his reputation could take a huge hit with one more incident, just like Ventura\xe2\x80\x99s has. "", 'birdswatcher.com'), (""Whatever chemistry's worth, Machado-Ventura brawl shows ..."", ' If one of your co-workers started a fight, would you have their back? It\'s not a hypothetical that most of us have to consider, but in the weird world of baseball, you never really know. A fight like what we saw involving the Orioles and Royals on Tuesday night isn\'t common, yet neither is it entirely unheard of.    There\'s little disputing the genesis of the incident. Kansas City\'s Yordano Ventura blatantly threw a pitch into Manny Machado\'s back. Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports noted that pitch, 99 miles per hour, was the hardest one Ventura had thrown all night.  O\'s manager Buck Showalter was firm in the belief that Ventura shook off his catcher wanting to throw a breaking ball in order to launch the fastball. Machado took exception to the pitch and made his way towards the mound to register his displeasure. A brawl can be thrilling in the moment, but it\'s not something that is a positive overall. When you get two opposing groups of men running at one another with varying levels of anger, all measure of crazy stuff can occur and it\'s not good if it results in an injury. An inciting action like Ventura\'s pitch is also dangerous and can hurt someone.    It would be better for everyone if Machado had not decided to go towards the mound. Better still if Ventura hadn\'t been throwing at Machado on purpose with his hardest pitch of the night, but as the tea-sipping muppet is always saying on the Internet, that\'s none of my business.    What happened isn\'t something that ought to be glorified. It is awfully interesting to break down the reactions of the two teams, though. Team chemistry is one of those slippery concepts that\'s often brought up in lazy baseball analysis, something that\'s cited precisely because there\'s not a lot of ways to prove it or disprove it. Whatever team chemistry is or isn\'t worth, the actions of the Orioles team during the fight and their statements afterward seem to make it pretty clear that they\'ve got it in spades, while the Royals, at least as regards Ventura, do not seem to have any such chemistry.    Take the sparking of the brawl. There was no person on the field who was heading into the fray faster than Chris Davis:   NO ONE TOUCHES MY MANNY pic.twitter.com/SDwTofE1pw\xe2\x80\x94 Ranting Oriole Bird (@RantingOriole) June 8, 2016    Those are some guys who look like they\'re ready to rumble. Even Francisco Pe\xc3\xb1a is heading into the fracas - you can tell him by his shinguards - and he\'s been here for all of a week. It\'s quite a contrast compared to the response of Royals catcher Salvador Perez. At the outset of the hostilities, no one was closer to Machado than Perez. Machado did not exactly go at full speed to the mound - a 99mph to the back hurts. Perez could have easily caught Machado from behind, had he chosen to. Instead, this happened:      MANNY MANNY MANNY MANNY MANNY!!!! https://t.co/KE5Q5GxyEl\xe2\x80\x94 Eroc RDT (@BarstoolRDT) June 8, 2016    Nor was Perez the only one who seemed to be fed up with Ventura\'s antics. The greeting for Ventura in the dugout after the donnybrook was more or less nonexistent:   This probably isn\'t what you want. pic.twitter.com/vboYXfvDn6\xe2\x80\x94 Jared Speckman (@Speck60) June 8, 2016    That\'s just a bit of a cold reception, wouldn\'t you say? In his post-game press conference, Royals manager Ned Yost was asked about whether there might be some frustration from other Royals players towards Ventura. ""Ehh,"" he replied, hemming and hawing, then finished, ""Probably."" It seemed to be an uncomfortable presser all around for Yost, who was also asked whose fault he thought the whole situation was. He settled on a mealy-mouthed response of, ""I don\'t know the answer to that."" Showalter was not one for equivocating in his own presser. Asked right off the bat whether he was disappointed in Machado\'s response to being hit, Showalter immediately replied, ""No.""    Another reporter asked whether Showalter thought there would be any more problems coming from the Royals in tonight\'s game. ""Bring it on,"" Showalter said with a shrug.  We saw in Tuesday\'s game how the Orioles are going to respond if something like that happens again. As Showalter also said, ""I didn\'t have much doubt with how they\'d respond."" You come at the king, you best not miss. Hopefully there are no more shenanigans coming. The best way the Orioles can respond is to sweep the series, not do anything that could result in further suspensions or potential injuries. They don\'t need to be paying the price as they go on to face their division competitors in the coming week. At least in Machado\'s case, there might be more than just a suspension coming. He\'ll probably have to pay a fine as well - or at least, a fine will be levied against him. Machado himself may not be the one paying it, as Adam Jones told reporters he would cover the fine himself. That\'s an action that speaks louder than any words, though of course, Jones being Jones, he had plenty of words to say about the situation as well. Jones noted ""the reaction by (the Royals), they weren\'t weren\'t too happy that (he) did something stupid.""    And as far as Machado goes, Jones said, ""I\'m glad for Manny for defending himself. Someone is trying to hurt you maliciously, you go out there and defend yourself.""  Only Ventura can know for sure how much malice there was in a 99mph fastball to the back, but it sure seems like a malicious action, and it\'s very clear that the Orioles as a team feel like Machado did what he had to do and they don\'t hold that against him. There aren\'t a whole lot of people who I\'d sprint across a field to back up in a fight. Each Oriole has 24 guys who he knows will back him up. Maybe it\'s not worth anything at all that the Orioles seem to be united in support of one of their teammates being in a fight. It surely doesn\'t hurt anything either.   ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The Orioles won 9-1. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have won five in a row and eight of the last nine games, and without doubt the subs and utility players have had a big role in this success.The contributions have not only been at the plate. For example, Ryan Flaherty has had a number of fine defensive plays including taking away a base hit from Encarnacion to end the 6-5 victory over the Blue Jays last night.With the way Buck Showalter shuffles his lineup and uses the bench, it is not immediately obvious as to who would qualify as a substitute. For example, Joey Rickard is more of a sub than a starter right now, but that was not true at the beginning of the season.But let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at some of the players who don\xe2\x80\x99t (or previously didn\xe2\x80\x99t) play daily and consider their contributions over this most recent streak of nine games in June.Hyun Soo Kim \xe2\x80\x93 We are beginning to see why Kim had the nickname of \xe2\x80\x9cthe hitting machine\xe2\x80\x9d in the Korean League. One of the several strange stories of this 2016 season is how Kim turned around a horrible spring and an early season benching (for the most part) into a highly successful run since playing more regularly.He has now started 21 of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 59 games and is batting .366 overall. Though only 1-for-4 last night, it was a key leadoff double in the top of the ninth that set up the tie-breaking, game-winning run to score.Kim is hitting 12-for-33 in June for an average of .364. He surely seems to have made the adjustment to American baseball, though I\xe2\x80\x99d love to know what he truly had going through his mind when running onto the field during the Machado-Ventura fight on Tuesday night.Ryan Flaherty \xe2\x80\x93 Not a favorite son here on The Baltimore Wire, but we acknowledge his key roles of late. This is proving especially helpful with Hardy still out and with Machado headed for suspension time.In these nine games of June, Flash has been 6-for-23 along with five walks. This has given some offensive help in turning over the lineup, while also contributing as always with his glove. Ryan had a key hit on Wednesday night that broke open a low-scoring game. We might need to begin being nicer to Flaherty here \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe, just maybe.Pedro Alvarez \xe2\x80\x93 In the big picture of things, getting Alvarez for this already power-packed team has not looked like the best offseason move. But he has hit better of late, driving a key home run last night to help bring the Orioles back from trailing early in the game.El Toro has started eight of the nine June games and is 9-for-28 (.321) with three home runs. Might the Orioles have to endure his play at third base for a few games with Manny being gone? If he keeps hitting, that would be tolerable.Nolan Reimold \xe2\x80\x93 All he does is get on base over and over. Nolan has been doing it all year and not getting rusty when so often just stuck waiting around to play. He is only 2-for-11 in June, but add four walks to that number. Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s season OBP is .367.Francisco Pena \xe2\x80\x93 Brought up as a defensive catcher to fill the role of the injured Caleb Joseph, he is 5-for-11 in his three games played, along with a big home run; and his catching and game-calling has been superb.

And they have won in varied fashions, with big 13-9 and 12-7 wins over the Red Sox, while also only giving up two runs in the four prior games to last evening. But that is what good teams do; they find a way to win every type of ballgame. And at 36-23, it has to be admitted that the Orioles are a pretty good team. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsA look at basic statistics demonstrates that the Baltimore Orioles have made a definitive improvement in offensive production from the corner outfield positions.This advance has contributed much to the Orioles (in spite of last night\xe2\x80\x99s 10th inning loss) having a 36-24 record that is only a half-game from being the best in the American League. This pace of winning three out of every five games may not seem to be terribly awesome, but it does set up a 97-win season if maintained to the end. That will work!Right field and left field were major concerns going into the most recent offseason, and a quick look at the 2015 numbers would show why. Production from O\xe2\x80\x99s left fielders in particular was among the worst in the league.A connected discussion with this is also what comes from the designated hitter role, as corner outfielders (at least on the Orioles) make up a bulk of the at-bats for DH.Here are comparative stats from 2015 / 2016 for these three positions, noting batting average, on-base percentage, and home runs from one year to the next. The rank for each stat speaks of where the number placed the Orioles among American League teams\xe2\x80\xa6Avg><RankOBP><RankHR><Rank15 RF.2754th.3189th249th16 RF.2924th.3635th123rd15 LF.21014th.28713th188th 16 LF.2863rd.3435th99th 15 DH.2537th.30811th1411th16 DH.2429th.3187th171st\xc2\xa0Right Field 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 The 2015 stats in RF are always a bit surprising, as memory does not seem to recall the numbers as having a fourth-best ranking in batting average, for example. Twelve different players spent some time out there, with Gerrardo Parra having the most games \xe2\x80\xa6 just 43. Delmon Young had 40 and Chris Davis 30, hitting nine homers in those 30 games. So the position was not a total loss in spite of the revolving door of others who brought down the total numbers. But the RF situation was very unsettled for the entire season.Right Field 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 There is still a shifting of players from day to day in right field, but the status is greatly improved over a year ago. Mark Trumbo has more than half of the at-bats from RF with 117 and a .333 average. Nolan Reimold is .308 from his time at the position. It is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s 15-for-68 (.221) that keeps the numbers from being truly stellar this year.Left Field 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 These are ugly, ugly numbers. It was a year-long struggle with David Lough at .218 and Steve Pearce at .214. Of the 575 at-bats last year from O\xe2\x80\x99s left fielders, only 108 from Reimold and four from Flaherty are still with the Orioles. And that constitutes good news and good change.Left Field 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s early season got the Orioles off to a good start in left field, and his current average from that position is .256.\xc2\xa0 Hyun Soo Kim will soon have more at-bats from this place and his current .337/.414 has greatly bolstered the left field position. Reimold adds an additional 13-for-50 with a pair of home runs. This is altogether a massive improvement over 2015.Designated Hitter 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 The only thing keeping these numbers from being rather horrid was Jimmy Paredes catching fire for half a season with a .279 average in 81 games. Beyond that, there is little we would want to remember about designated hitters in 2015.Designated Hitter 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Apart from two games with Matt Wieters at DH (a role that he has never done well with), this is evenly split between Mark Trumbo and Pedro Alvarez. The 17 home runs (11 by Trumbo, 6 by Alvarez) ties for best in the American League (with some dude from Boston) and is already three more than came from the entire 2015 season. We would like to see a higher batting average, but the power numbers are doing much to make up for that.

Adding their eight day two picks to the ones they made on Thursday night, the Orioles have now drafted eight pitchers, six of whom come from the college ranks.    My pick recap for the O\'s three day one picks, including top pick Cody Sedlock from the University of Illinois, can be found here. The most notable pick the Orioles made on the second day of the draft was not a pitcher at all, though. That would be their seventh round pick, Preston Palmeiro, a first baseman from North Carolina State University. Yes, that Palmeiro. Preston is Rafael\xe2\x80\x99s son. A 6\xe2\x80\x990"" lefty batter, the younger Palmeiro is built like his father, and apparently swings like him, too. That\xe2\x80\x99s according to the elder Palmeiro himself, who spoke to Dan Connolly of Baltimore Baseball on Friday evening after Preston was drafted.    Rafael Palmeiro told Connolly that the O\xe2\x80\x99s reached out to the family before the draft to ask whether there would be too much baggage involved for the family with the O\xe2\x80\x99s drafting Preston. ""We were totally all in,"" said the former Oriole.    It\'s actually a bit of a surprise that the son of a major leaguer slipped as low as the seventh round. Those kinds of players usually go earlier. Perhaps it\'s because the Palmeiro name makes things complicated, or perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s because he\'s not yet got the power teams would look for in a first baseman. Preston Palmeiro was ranked as the 292nd prospect on the Baseball America 500.    The elder Palmeiro, admittedly a biased source of information, thinks his son will develop power with maturity and also believes N.C. State\xe2\x80\x99s home stadium is a bad one for power hitters. That\'s not true of Oriole Park at Camden Yards, as Palmeiro knows as well as anyone. A parade of high schoolers Starting in the fourth round, the Orioles picked three straight players from the high school ranks. Two are pitchers: Fourth round pick Brenan Hanifee, from Bridgewater, VA, and sixth rounder Tobias Myers, from Winter Haven, FL. In the fifth round they grabbed shortstop Alexis Torres from Colegio Angel David in Puerto Rico. Hanifee, #181 on the BA500, is the best rated prospect of the three of these. He is interesting as well because, as the MLB.com draft broadcast relayed on Friday, Hanifee\xe2\x80\x99s father is an Orioles fan who even has an Orioles tattoo. Hanifee himself, from some of his tweets, sure looks like he\'s been an O\'s fan for a while.    Many Virginians have given in to their historic tendency to turn traitor in recent years, but it seems the Hanifee family is not among them - and now that Hanifee is in the O\xe2\x80\x99s system, I\'m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s an even stronger tie. The draft broadcast labeled the 6\xe2\x80\x994"" Hanifee as ""projectable, maybe even ultra-projectable,"" which usually reflects a belief that the player could add velocity as his frame fills out. Hanifee is listed at 185 lbs., which is not a lot for a professional baseball player of that height. Baseball America\xe2\x80\x99s Michael Lananna hinted that the O\xe2\x80\x99s may have snagged Hanifee before the Pirates, who were interested, could take him. (Correction: The Pirates in this tweet appears to actually refer to the East Carolina University Pirates, where Hanifee is committed to attend.) Torres, the shortstop, received this report from Fangraphs back in November:  Torres has the obvious tools to play the infield, but his footwork and transfer to release skills are a bit lacking for a prototypical shortstop. At the plate, he has an excellent hand path with tons of athleticism in his swing. Right now his swing and build don\xe2\x80\x99t project to give him even average power, but average or better grades across the board otherwise make him a very intriguing player to follow.     Torres is listed at 6\xe2\x80\x990"" and 183 lbs. The concern about his build brings to mind another high school shortstop the O\'s drafted a few years ago, 2012\xe2\x80\x99s third rounder Adrian Marin, listed at 6\xe2\x80\x990"" and 180 lbs. Marin is a fringy hitter who\xe2\x80\x99s never developed the power - for Bowie this year, he\xe2\x80\x99s batting .227/.288/.307. Not much harm in taking a stab at a similar player, this time in the fifth round, to see if he develops differently. Myers, the Florida pitcher, was deep on the BA500 at #324. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what they had to say about him:  Myers had some early buzz this spring after he touched 93 mph with his fastball, but has more typically pitched around 90 mph. He combines his fastball with a solid curveball and a seldom-used changeup. Myers is a good athlete and has a loose, easy delivery that he repeats well. He earns praise for his pitchability. Listed at 6-foot-1, 175 pounds, there is some projection to him, particularly because has been a two-way player in high school.  I don\'t know where they get 6\xe2\x80\x991"" and 175 lbs. as he\xe2\x80\x99s listed by the Orioles as 6\xe2\x80\x990"" and 190, but hey, the world of obscure prospects is a predictably vague place.    MLB Advanced Media produced a short video package from an outing Myers had last July:  Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect too much from a sixth round pick on general principle - but, if a sixth round pick was going to surprise you, Myers achieving some of the projection that the BA scouting report mentions is one way it might happen. Back to the college ranks The first Orioles pick of the day was a college outfielder: Austin Hays from Jacksonville University, picked in the third round. They went high school for three picks as outlined above, then added Palmeiro before closing the day with three pitchers. Those pitchers are Ryan Moseley, a righty from Texas Tech, picked in the eighth round; Lucas Humpal, a righty from Texas State, picked in the ninth round; and Cody Dube of Keene State College (NH), picked in the tenth round of the draft. Humpal and Dube are both college seniors, meaning they are likely just players who will sign for a small signing bonus. That will allow the Orioles to use some of that slot money on signing some of their other draft picks. This is a common strategy for teams.    In general - though of course there are always exceptions - college players with the most potential have been drafted and signed before they become seniors. Hays, the highest-drafted position player by the Orioles this year, was described on the draft broadcast after his selection as ""the rare toolsy college outfielder."" The label ""toolsy"" is more typically put on high school draftees who are more athletes bringing skills to baseball than polished baseball players yet. The people at BA were highest on Hays, rating him as their 47th prospect for the draft. That makes him an interesting potential value pick; getting the #47 guy at #91 is how you have a good draft. Others rated him lower, with Baseball Prospectus bringing him in at #80 and MLB.com putting him 120th. Still, even the lowest rated one at MLB gave him this scouting report:  The right-handed Floridian uses a short and handsy swing to consistently make the ball jump off his bat. Hays doesn\'t waste a lot of motion and has shown both the ability to hit for average and power, albeit it in a weaker conference. It might be more doubles power at the next level, but Hays has shown over-the-fence ability is in there. His plus arm also profiles well in right field, where he is a very capable defender.     With the caveat that almost everybody sounds like a future big leaguer in their MLB.com scouting report, that sounds like a fine player to get to add in the third round of the draft, especially considering he\xe2\x80\x99s an outfielder and the Orioles minor league outfield depth is almost nonexistent. Moseley, the Texas Tech pitcher, is not anywhere to be found on the BA500. That may sound problematic, but he was actually a pick that excited Jim Callis and Jonathan Mayo on the draft broadcast. Before this year, Moseley was seen as a potential first round pick on the strength of his first two seasons in the Texas Tech rotation. The hiccup that sent him down to the eighth round is that he was pulled from the rotation after only three starts this year. The problem? His ""control and command aren\xe2\x80\x99t sharp."" Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a familiar story. He may be a future reliever, although MLB\xe2\x80\x99s scouting capsule says pro clubs, presumably including the Orioles, aren\'t ready to kick him to the bullpen forever just yet. Maybe the most interesting thing about Moseley is this: ""His primary weapon is a 91-95mph fastball with power sink."" Every time the Orioles draft a pitcher whose sinker is his best pitch, an angel gets its wings. They could do a whole lot worse than collecting a bunch of sinkerballers, seeing who\xe2\x80\x99s good enough to move up the ladder, and going from there.     A best case scenario for the deeper rounds of this draft would probably be something like the O\'s 2013 draft, where, three years later, despite Hunter Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s injury problems, the Orioles still have five players with at least a little bit of prospect potential - and two more, Stephen Tarpley and Steven Brault, were pieces in a trade. Never mind that the Travis Snider trade was terrible, it speaks well of the O\xe2\x80\x99s scouting staff that they found a third rounder and an eleventh rounder who could be traded for a big leaguer. Best of luck to all of these picks, and the ones who will be drafted today, in their professional careers. Hopefully a few years down the road we will get to see them having success in an Orioles uniform.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The Orioles and Red Sox are each 11 games over, Toronto is four games over, and the Yankees are one game over and the Rays are three games under (as of 530 p.m. Saturday.)Three games under is by far the best worst team in a division.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles rally, and rally some more, but can\\u2019t overcome ...', ' There\'s bad pitching and then there\'s whatever Ubaldo Jimenez was doing for the Orioles on Sunday afternoon. Jimenez was unable to complete the first inning, which did not stop him from still managing to give up five runs.     Despite that large early deficit, the Orioles went on to rally to come most of the way back only to see their bullpen dig the hole even deeper. A second rally came up just short, with the tying run on third base as the game ended, with the Orioles, after all that, falling to the Blue Jays, 10-9. If this story sounds familiar after Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game, well, you\xe2\x80\x99re not wrong about that. Jimenez was even worse than Mike Wright was on Saturday. Throwing strikes wasn\'t as much of a problem for Jimenez, rather that every strike he threw was completely and totally hittable.  Words that are usually used to describe poor pitching performances such as \xe2\x80\x9cbad\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cterrible\xe2\x80\x9d are insufficient to the task of describing an outing where the starting pitcher gives up five runs on six hits in only a third of an inning pitched.     You have to be on another level to be bad enough to make manager Buck Showalter come out for the pitching change in the first inning. Ubaldo was on that level and beyond.    It\'s tempting to say that a pitcher like Jimenez should just be left out to dry in a game like that. For a team that has a pedestrian offense a five run deficit in the first inning might inspire a feeling of, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is over, might as well save the bullpen.\xe2\x80\x9d The Orioles are not such a team. Jimenez had to be pulled to give them a chance - and they took the chance. Trying, again, to overcome poor starting pitching The Orioles offense is never out of a game. That\xe2\x80\x99s all there is to it. Put them in any deficit early in a game and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. They will start scoring eventually and maybe they will even be able to score enough, even against a pitcher who has done well, like Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Aaron Sanchez this year.    They started off by clawing back a run in the very next inning as Pedro Alvarez, Jonathan Schoop, and Ryan Flaherty strung together consecutive singles to get the O\xe2\x80\x99s on the board. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step and all that. If the target had remained at a five run deficit to pull back, the Orioles might have gotten somewhere. Of course, it did not. The Jays added to their lead in subsequent innings against Vance Worley. You can\'t even get mad at Worley, really.  Well, you can, but you shouldn\'t, although the part where he gave up a third-deck home run to Kevin Pillar was frustrating. Still, Worley\xe2\x80\x99s not why they lost the game. He did his best and he stabilized the situation, pitching 4.1 innings and giving up just two runs. At this point he\xe2\x80\x99s more deserving of Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s rotation spot than Jimenez is.    So it was 7-1 and that too may seem insurmountable to a team that\xe2\x80\x99s not the Orioles, but these are the Orioles we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about and there will be dongs. There were many today. Pedro Alvarez got the party started in the fourth inning with a solo shot crushed to deep center, his seventh homer of the year. That was merely a prelude for the fifth inning, when the Orioles punished a tiring Sanchez by launching dingers in as many directions as possible. Adam Jones led off the inning with a home run, making it 7-3. That was #10 of the year for him. Later, Manny Machado added a double, meaning he was on base when Chris Davis launched his fifth home run in as many games.  Suddenly it was a lot more interesting, the score pulled back to 7-5. It became more interesting still when Matt Wieters joined the party with his sixth homer of the year. Abruptly a once out-of-control game was just a one-run game. Before the inning was over, Alvarez and Schoop both singled again as well, putting the tying run in scoring position, but Flaherty struck out this time.    That closed the book on Sanchez, who came out after five innings having allowed six runs on ten hits and three walks - including four home runs. Sanchez had only allowed four home runs in 80.1 innings before today. Regression comes at you fast. The bullpen makes it worse, again The culprit on Saturday was T.J. McFarland, which you kind of expect. The culprit on Sunday was Mychal Givens, which you do not expect. The Jones Theory of Everything, which states, ""Sometimes you suck,\xe2\x80\x9d applied in force to Givens. Givens came in for the sixth inning. The game had become close enough to start using good relievers. Unfortunately, Givens was not good today. He walked Josh Donaldson, then after a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice, walked Michael Saunders as well, bringing up Russell Martin, who has been terrible this year but not this series. This series the Orioles keep walking Martin and today when they finally didn\'t walk him, despite his batting .208, Givens allowed Martin to hit a three-run home run. Sure seemed like a dagger, putting the Orioles down 10-6, but even then, it\xe2\x80\x99s never truly over. The second Orioles comeback began in the eighth inning when switch pitcher Pat Venditte left an 0-2 breaking ball hanging out over the plate for Jones. That\'s a bad idea, and with Flaherty having reached on an infield single right before that, it meant Jones\xe2\x80\x99 second homer of the day - and 11th of the year - was good for two runs to make it 10-8.    Which brings us to the ninth inning. The Jays did not use closer Roberto Osuna, choosing instead to have Jason Grilli try to get the save. Grilli began the year being terrible for the Braves and he began his outing today with problems.  Machado led off with a single. Grilli then walked Davis, putting the tying run on base with nobody out, before recording a strikeout of Mark Trumbo. Not the best day of Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s career: 0-5. He was the only Orioles starter not to reach base. Next in line was Wieters, whom Grilli walked on four straight pitches, putting the go-ahead run on base with just one out. It was Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s turn to try to make something happen. If you were watching, you were probably excited when Alvarez worked the count in his favor and took a big cut and made contact with a 2-0 pitch from Grilli - but as the ball flew towards right, Jays right fielder Saunders timed his leap just right and caught the line drive against the fence.  This was easily deep enough to score Machado from third base and went down as a sacrifice fly, with the tying run moving up to third base on the play.    Next came Schoop, who had three hits on the day, and not to harp on him too much when the big story of the day is complete Orioles pitching failure, but this moment was too big for Schoop and he struck out swinging on three pitches, two of which were out of the strike zone. After all of that, it was over. Close does not count in baseball. And as long as so much of their starting rotation keeps pitching this way, the Orioles are going to be hard-pressed to keep making things close. That is a problem for another day. After a Monday off day, the Orioles will be in Boston to begin a three-game series, the winner of which will be leading the American League East at the end. The 7:10 opener on Tuesday will see Chris Tillman take the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, with David Price pitching for the Red Sox.

This year, they were able to make 41 selections over the draft\xe2\x80\x99s 40 rounds.    Most of the Orioles picks were pitchers. They drafted 14 position players and took 27 pitchers. Among the pitchers, 12 are left-handed and 15 are right-handed. For the position players, nine are infielders and five are outfielders. They did not select a catcher. They picked 31 college players and ten high schoolers, with only three high schoolers in the first ten rounds. The others may be tougher signs. Of the college players, six came from the junior college ranks and the rest from four year schools. Ten are seniors, with one draft-eligible sophomore and the other 14 being juniors. Recent history suggests that the Orioles will be signing a large majority of these picks. They\xe2\x80\x99ve signed at least 30 players every year since 2012 when the current draft slotting system came into place.    There have only been two occasions where they failed to sign a pick in the top ten rounds, the most recent of which was last year\xe2\x80\x99s second rounder, Jonathan Hughes. That gave them an extra second round pick this year. If a top ten rounds pick doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sign, they lose the value of that draft slot from their draft pool.    Included in this year\xe2\x80\x99s draft class are two sons of former Orioles: seventh round pick Preston Palmeiro, son of Rafael, and 13th round pick Brandon Bonilla, son of Bobby. The Orioles previously drafted the younger Bonilla in the 25th round two years ago. The Orioles will have about $6.7 million they will be allowed to spend on these picks. Anyone taken from the 11th round and on can sign for up to $100,000 without counting against the bonus pool. They can exceed this amount by up to 5% without any lost draft pick penalties.

The 17th rounder, Blohm, has a scholarship waiting for him at the University of Maryland. He\'ll probably end up going there, with the Orioles drafting him more a way of recognizing, ""Hey, you\'re in our back yard and we see you."" If the Orioles are lucky, this draft class will turn out like the one of 2013, where several years later a number of the later-round picks still have at least a bit of prospect potential. The college signees will probably head for Aberdeen or perhaps Delmarva, while we can guess the high school players will debut in the Gulf Coast League.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
06/13/2016,"[('An idea for the Orioles to fix Mike Wright - Camden Chat', "" Mike Wright has all of the component parts of a good pitcher. He is listed at 6\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d 215 lbs. He is a big hulking right handed pitcher that can hit 99 mph on the gun while having four other pitches in his arsenal.     To top it all off he has the stamina and endurance to maintain his stuff as the game goes on. Yet, Mike Wright has a career 5.62 ERA and none of his peripheral statistics indicate anything other than he is a bad pitcher. He does not strike enough batters out, he walks too many, and he cannot keep the ball in the ballpark. All of this is due to lack of command and lack of consistency.  I would say that this is mostly anecdotal, but from what I can tell from watching the games. Command and consistency are hard to quantify. Yet, we can try. To try to put it simply, the lowest Isolated Power (ISO) allowed on any of Mike Wright\xe2\x80\x99s pitches during his career is his sinker at .162.  A .162 is an above average power hitter in the major leagues. That is his best pitch from a results standpoint. His four seam fastball sits a .186 ISO. All of his breaking pitchers are at or above .200. While his pitches have good velocity and decent movement they all get hammered by opposing batters.     From my eyes, he struggles with repeating his delivery in particular on his breaking balls. Some look sharp, others are flat. On his change up, he can at times telegraph his delivery by slowing his whole body down to release the pitch slower.     All of these pitches flash enough to get the job done, but at this point, in his age 26 season, the time for Wright to learn how to be an effective major league starter is waning. The Orioles, while certainly lacking for other quality fill in candidates, cannot afford to keep Wright in the rotation for long.  Even if he is sent to AAA with the idea towards starting, I have doubts that anything can be changed this late in the game. So what can be done, let\xe2\x80\x99s change Mike Wright into a reliever.     Most quality relievers are failed starters. In the bullpen, going only one inning at a time, the game can be simplified. The times through the order penalty goes down. A pitcher can more of a thrower. While converting Mike Wright to the bullpen we are going to scrap some of his pitches as well.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s make the game as simple as possible. All of his fastballs are going to be sinkers now. For the off speed, were keeping the slider and throwing everything else out. A sinker/slider right handed reliever. I picked those two pitches for two reasons.  First, those have been his best two of his throughout his career. While neither have gotten good results, both are his best. Opponents are only hitting .254 on his slider, and while they are hitting .338 on his sinker, it gets ground balls. Mike Wright gets ground balls on 11.59 percent of his sinkers.     For comparison, Zach Britton gets ground balls on 15.29 percent of his sinkers. Give me that kind of ground ball rate and I have got something to work with as a reliever.  Furthermore, Wright gets Whiffs on those two pitches the most. He actually gets Whiffs on his change up more often than his other pitches, but his change up is also crushed to outer space a good deal more. Whiffs and ground balls are what we are looking for.  Second, Wright appears to command these pitches better than other ones. These pitches are consistently down in the zone. This year, only his curve ball has been on average located lower than his sinker and slider and it's only by .01 feet lower than his slider. Not only that, last year the curve ball was located much higher in the zone, again a lack of consistency with the pitch.          When Wright throws his sinker and slider the pitches are located better, get better results, and still have the velocity and movement that he needs to be an effective pitcher. A sinker/slider starter rarely works, but coming out of the bullpen it could be lethal.  Mike Wright currently averages a tad under 94 mph on his sinker and 84 mph on his slider. While only being asked to work one inning a time, it is possible\xe2\x80\x94if not likely\xe2\x80\x94that his velocity could go up. The ground balls and whiffs those two pitches have been able to get thus far are impressive.    Sending Wright down to AAA and giving him only two pitches to work on, two pitches to command, two pitches to repeat, and two pitches to be consistent with gives him a chance to succeed where he has failed. Otherwise, the Orioles are going to keep finding themselves trying to work out of big deficits.

What will the roster look like in regards to the pitching staff when they get going again tomorrow night? Tough to say now, but time will tell. "", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('The Orioles are paying a price for trying to save money on ...', "" The Orioles starting rotation is a unit loaded up with problems. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be this way, but the struggles of Ubaldo Jimenez and the injury to Yovani Gallardo have exposed the lack of depth in the Orioles system for MLB-ready starting pitching.    Things didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be this way, either. They had another choice for depth who they could have kept around. That was Miguel Gonzalez, who was released at the end of spring training in order to save about $3.5 million in salary. With what\xe2\x80\x99s gone on with the starting rotation since Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s departure, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the Orioles are now paying the price for trying to save money on Gonzalez. Jimenez is the obvious culprit for a starting pitcher who needs to lose his spot if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t abruptly right his ship, but he\xe2\x80\x99s hardly the only one who would be on the hot seat - or at least not the only one if he was in an organization with real pitching depth.     The Orioles are not such an organization, which is why their two players who pass for pitching depth, Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson, are currently in the starting rotation rather than waiting in the wings. In the long run the O\xe2\x80\x99s may find that neither one belongs.    The problem with ditching Gonzalez For now, the Orioles could use Gonzalez. They didn't have to release him, even if they were convinced he was incapable of contributing to the 2016 rotation right at the start of the season. They could have used a minor league option to send him to Norfolk, giving him time to either regain his form or at least be available as a better emergency option than Odrisamer Despaigne. At the time, that specific move made some sense because Gonzalez did not have a good spring, so it was fair to wonder whether he had just reached the end of the line. He barely touched 90mph on the radar gun in any of his spring starts and his 87-88mph pitches were not being treated kindly by professional hitters.    However, we have since seen Gonzalez surface in the White Sox organization, where, since things are a mess, they quickly called on Gonzalez at the big league level even though he only signed a minor league contract. Even after Chicago made a big, surprising acquisition of James Shields, they still have kept Gonzalez around, choosing to release the struggling Mat Latos instead. No wonder they have kept Gonzalez in their rotation when seeing what he\xe2\x80\x99s done so far. I say this without having watched him in action, but a cursory perusal of his season numbers reveals a guy who still has some value, one whom the Orioles made a poor decision to cast aside so easily. If the radar gun was the worry, Gonzalez has dispelled that, at least up to now. His average fastball velocity so far his 91.2mph, right in line with where he worked in his successful big league campaigns in 2013 and 2014. It's hard to argue, too, with his ERA of 3.57. That would look good in the O's rotation.    It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that there are some red flags as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s only been seven starts. Things may look differently after another seven starts. And even for now, there\xe2\x80\x99s some concern that he\xe2\x80\x99s averaging less than 5.2 innings per start he makes, while carrying a higher batting average against (.258) and WHIP (1.364) than he did in any of his good Orioles years. Still, if the Orioles had been willing to absorb the entirety of Gonzalez's $5.1 million salary and just have him in Norfolk, they could have been the ones to look up and see what he has left. Now they are paying the price for pinching pennies over his salary. A baseball team can always get more money. It can\xe2\x80\x99t just shake a tree and have a guy with two and a half successful big league seasons under his belt fall out of it. Which brings to mind one question: Why did they do it? There must be some answer, but the Orioles probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be telling it. What made the Gonzalez release strange at the time, and leaves it feeling strange still, is that the Orioles conducted both their offseason, and spring training, spending as if a few million dollars wasn't going to make or break the bank. The Orioles shelled out big bucks to keep Chris Davis, moderate bucks to keep Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, and found themselves on the hook for the qualifying offer to Matt Wieters. They made a modest commitment to Hyun Soo Kim.     Once spring training arrived, they still signed Yovani Gallardo to a deal that will pay him $6.5 million this year (not counting deferred money) and also Pedro Alvarez to a deal worth up to $7 million. And let's not forget the strange almost-signing of Dexter Fowler, which, according to what was being reported at the time, was supposed to be a three year signing worth $11 million per year. It\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say the Orioles wouldn't have added Alvarez if they had gotten Fowler into the fold, but they would have been spending a few million dollars more as well. Why make these last moves if they were scraping up against the limit of the budget, or even going beyond it? Were the Orioles planning how to dump some salary as soon as they signed Alvarez? Were they expecting to shave off a few million from the payroll when they believed they were very close to a deal with Fowler? Fowler could well have seemed like a player who was worth busting the budget a bit to sign. With how he\xe2\x80\x99s playing so far this year, batting .295/.403/.496 in 59 games, they would have been right about that. But could they have possibly believed that Alvarez was worth smashing through their budget number? This is something that it is hard to imagine being true. What if Gonzalez had a good spring training? How would the Orioles have peeled away $3.5 million in payroll then? They might have released Vance Worley, saving about $2 million, or even Brian Matusz during spring training, saving $3 million. But maybe it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even about the money. Maybe they just gave up on Gonzalez too soon.    I wonder whether the much-discussed drop in attendance at Camden Yards has played a role in some of their payroll-shaving maneuvering, including the salary dump trade of Matusz to the Braves. Compared to their first 35 gates last season, O\xe2\x80\x99s attendance is down about 18%. That\xe2\x80\x99s not all the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fault. Lots of bad early weather surely played a factor, as well as a lack of any weekend series against the Red Sox, or even the Yankees struggles drawing fewer of their bandwagon fans. These things add up. But maybe they made some optimistic revenue forecasts that just haven't borne out. They\xe2\x80\x99d hardly be the first company to ever do so. Maybe they believed they\xe2\x80\x99d sell the same number of tickets, just at this year\xe2\x80\x99s increased price. Since that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t proved true perhaps they\xe2\x80\x99re harder up for cash than they should be. Whatever it is, the O's must be smarter If it was about the money, the Orioles need to not overspend their budget in the future so they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to make any short-sighted salary dump moves like releasing Gonzalez or trading Matusz. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about the money and it was just about deciding Gonzalez was toast, the Orioles need to be more patient in their evaluations of players who may still have something to contribute, especially when those players have a minor league option remaining and don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be on the team or DFA'd.    The Orioles are never going to be some large-market team that can afford to spend its way out of mistakes. Everything that the Orioles do will have a cost down the road. Even saving money has a cost, as the case of Gonzalez shows.  The cost is not paid in money but in a lack of talent on the team in the short and long term. They are paying that cost now and every time they do something like this they will set themselves up to pay it again.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Who knows. There have been worse starting pitchers than Ubaldo who have been able to make a successful transition to the bullpen (Zach Britton comes to mind). Even Brian Matusz was able to be a solid reliever for two seasons. The Orioles could easily get similar numbers from Jimenez if he can make the transition.In order to have success in the bullpen, Jimenez will have to work his way up the ladder. He will likely be used solely as a long reliever at the beginning, being given mop up duty. Should he be able to work his way up, he could be a middle relief option and make the Orioles greatest strength even stronger.Next: Orioles beat Red Sox to get back in first placeOne thing is for sure \xe2\x80\x93 Ubaldo Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s time in Baltimore is running out.

The Baltimore Orioles took over sole possession of first place in the American League East with a combination of pitching and power, and the Boston Red Sox would like to return the favor. The Red Sox will try to pull back into a tie for first place in the AL East when they host the Orioles in the second of a three-game series on Wednesday. The Orioles offense combined for 13 strikeouts on Tuesday but also slugged a pair of home runs in support of a strong effort from Chris Tillman in a 3-2 triumph. The win snapped a three-game slide and was a departure from the beginning of the road trip in Toronto, where the Baltimore pitching staff let up a combined 30 runs in the four-game series. Boston has dropped seven of its last 11 games to lose control of the East, with three of those setbacks coming against the Orioles. The Red Sox lead the majors in several offensive categories, including runs scored, but have been outscored 52-47 while dropping five of the first eight meetings with Baltimore. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Tyler Wilson (2-5, 4.73 ERA) vs. Red Sox RH Steven Wright (7-4, 2.09) Wilson is enduring a five-start winless streak but got enough offensive support to stay out of the decision at Toronto on Thursday. The Virginia native was knocked around for five runs on seven hits and three walks in 5 2/3 innings in a game the Orioles went on to win 6-5. Wilson matched up with Wright on May 30 and came away with a loss despite holding the Boston offense to three runs on eight hits and a pair of walks in 6 2/3 frames. Wright continues to baffle opposing hitters with his knuckleball and did not allow an earned run in either of his last two starts. The 31-year-old ran his streak to four wins in as many starts by holding the Minnesota Twins to an unearned run on seven hits and two walks while striking out six over 7 1/3 innings on Friday. Wright tossed a complete game at Baltimore on May 30, scattering two runs, four hits and five walks over the nine frames to earn the win. WALK-OFFS 1. The Orioles have homered 32 times in 13 games this month. 2. Six of Red Sox CF Jackie Bradley Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s seven hits this month have gone for extra bases. 3. Baltimore SS Manny Machado is 6-for-14 with two homers and six runs scored in the last three games.

Mandatory Credit: Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles top starter Chris Tillman came out on the winning end of a pitchers\xe2\x80\x99 duel with Boston Red Sox ace David Price.The entire discussion of what constitutes an \xe2\x80\x9cace\xe2\x80\x9d is actually rather annoying. It is more than a bit subjective. But with a record of 9-1 in 14 starts, with an ERA of 2.87 and WHIP of 1.16, I think we can see Tillman as an ace at least by Orioles standards.David Price \xe2\x80\x93 now there\xe2\x80\x99s a true ace, right? After all, he\xe2\x80\x99s 111-60 for his career and is a five-time All-Star, a CYA winner, and is making $30 million this season. That is close to a million dollars for each start. His record now is 7-4 with an ERA of 4.52 and WHIP of 1.13. Tillman is keeping good company.Truly both were stellar on this evening where the Orioles prevailed 3-2 to take sole possession of first place. Price at one point retired 19 in a row, while Tillman set down 12 consecutive batters. Good stuff. Thank God for home runs by the amigos Machado and Schoop.Zach Britton registered a five-out save. This is nothing to fear or be concerned about, especially after four days off. Beyond that he only threw a total of 22 pitches (whereas Tillman recorded 120).In other pitching news, the good word is that Ubaldo Jimenez is headed for the bullpen. How he can be used there is a mystery yet to be solved, but surely he will do less damage in that role. He needs a total re-set.Taking his place in the lineup will be Yovani Gallardo, apparently ready to go after his third rehab start in Norfolk. As written previously here, I have minimal faith in this as a long-term solution, but the Ubaldo situation has made me joyfully anticipate it.Also added to the Orioles staff is Odrisamer Despaigne. To review, this 29-year-old Cuban has a MLB record of 9-16, ERA of 4.74 in two seasons of 222 innings with the Padres. His minor league numbers aren\xe2\x80\x99t extra great this year, though he has thrown well in recent games and can provide length in the absence of Vance Worley.This strategy of going with the hot hand is going to be the way the Orioles get through this 2016 season. Beyond Tillman and Kevin Gausman, the Orioles will hope to have an additional three starters generally pitch decent ball. The candidates to seize these spots are the aforementioned Gallardo, Jimenez and Worley. Despaigne can move up if he gets people out, just don\xe2\x80\x99t bet too much on it. And then there are the rookies Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson.

Few teams actually have that, though most are not living with uncertainties in three of the five positions. If even two of these guys can get some consistency, it will be huge. The Orioles can stumble along through a fifth game with a series of throwers. This could work, though the margin for error is not substantial. Tillman will need to be a year-long ace for it to work.

As Baltimore fans remember, trading for elite bullpen talent tends to cost a lot. In 2014, they had to give up Eduardo Rodriguez for Miller. They also gave up Nick Delmonico for Francisco Rodriguez in 2013.The Orioles are in a very good place. They don\xe2\x80\x99t need a Chapman or a Miller to have a dominant bullpen. Sure, they should explore grabbing a lefty specialist at the trade deadline and they certainly have other needs as well. But Baltimore fans should note that other teams are trying to copy the O\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen. And as they say, imitation is the highest possible form of flattery.Next: Ubaldo to the bullpenIf Baltimore can get six decent innings out of their starting pitchers, their bullpen will a lot more often than not do their job and keep their team in a position to win. Considering the Royals just won the 2015 World Series with a slightly above average at best rotation and an elite bullpen, that gives the O\xe2\x80\x99s a great blueprint for success. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the Orioles to perfect it. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Bob Haynie: Tillman\\u2019s Ace Performance Lifts Orioles Over ...', ' After winning the opener, the Baltimore Orioles lost three-straight games to the Toronto Blue Jays over the past weekend. During that series, Baltimore starting pitchers posted an unsightly 8.31 ERA. Ubaldo Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s 0.1 IP outing on Sunday was downright embarrassing. In need of a quality start, manager Buck Showalter turned to right-hander Chris Tillman to get it done. On Tuesday night against the Boston Red Sox, the Orioles ace was up to the challenge. Tillman pitched seven strong innings to out-duel Boston ace David Price as the Birds edged the Red Sox 3-2 at Fenway Park. With the victory, the Orioles (37-26) moved back into sole possession of first place in the AL East. Manny Machado and Jonathan Schoop went deep as the Orioles improved to 5-3 against Boston (36-27) in 2016. Since the beginning of 2012, the Birds are now 51-32 overall vs. the Red Sox. Tillman scattered five hits and struck out seven as he improved to 9-1 on the year. If he continues to pitch at this level, he would seem to be a lock to make the AL All-Star team. Aside from Tillman and Kevin Gausman, the Orioles have a shaky starting rotation. RHP Yovani Gallardo returns to the staff on Saturday and that should help. However, there are more uncertainties than certainties going on at this time. As I have talked about and written before, the Birds need to stabilize their starting pitching if they want to play postseason baseball. Maybe help will eventually come from outside the organization. GM Dan Duquette has made in-season moves before with varying levels of success.

06/17/2016,"[('In Zach Britton, the Orioles have baseball\\u2019s best closer ...', ' As baseball continues to adapt to the ever-present development of furthering information, folks have hypothesized that a \xe2\x80\x9ccloser-by-committee\xe2\x80\x9d approach may be the way of future.     There\xe2\x80\x99s some sense to it, sure. Navigating the bullpen to favor the arm-side match-ups provides its benefits. For example, let\xe2\x80\x99s say you start the 9th inning with two right-handed batters, followed by a lefty.  In comes Mychal Givens, a notorious nightmare for right-handers whose sweeping slider and mid-90\'s fastball perfectly slots him as a two-batter specialist. Who follows? For farts and giggles how about Fernando Abad, whose current .100/.125/.133 slash versus lefties is a natural fit to record the crucial 27th out.  Manipulating the odds into your favor using situational splits, even more so as the baseball game reaches its breaking point, is a strategy that should work, and can work. Baseball has created the specialist to succeed in special opportunities, and again, the numbers theorize its merits.     In today\xe2\x80\x99s sphere, the Clint Eastwoods of the world intimidated by kids and their algebras often fall back to traditional baseball acumen using phrases like \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s a baseball player\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9che knows how to get outs\xe2\x80\x9d. We call that the \xe2\x80\x9cHarold Reynolds Doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, there is some truth we can latch onto thanks to the old-schoolers.     Despite an abundance of what tends to be overwhelming raw talent at the position, closing baseball games can\xe2\x80\x99t be fun, man. Storming out of the outfield gates, running to the mound with the force of the crowd, both for and against your cause.  Classic rock, hip-hop, modern pop or whatever it is, the music usually playing in your Beats are instead blared over the loudspeakers, amplifying the moment to come. Three outs. You only need three outs, but as the situation dictates, you\xe2\x80\x99re in control of the finishing frame. Closing takes a certain kind of personality combined with the right dominant stuff, and not everyone has those things like Britton does.    What a relief it is for the likes of us to know that even on nights the Orioles score a bunch and surrender a few less, or squeak out a lead only to lean on the rare quality start, that Britton slumbers in the bullpen. There really isn\xe2\x80\x99t any other way to put it than to say he\xe2\x80\x99s awesome. Super-duper, man-crush Monday, Khaleesi-burnin\xe2\x80\x99-bad-guys kind of awesome.  Comparing a mortal man to the Mother of Dragons should not be taken lightly, but who is to say that Britton is a mortal man? How is that a human being is capable of throwing a 96 MPH fastball that moves like a wiffle ball? And just how good is Britton? You know, 0.96 ERA and perfect 20 saves in 20 chances kind of speaks for itself, as do his 0.61 WHIP and .180 BABIP. His initial 2016 returns, purely from a numbers standpoint, plant the idealistic seed that perhaps, just perhaps, Britton is indeed what some would call the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d closer in baseball.     Can that be perceived as homerism?  Sure, but having the pleasure of watching Britton pitch 27 games so far this year has done more to cement the notion than detract it.  Aroldis Chapman has his fastball, Kenley Jansen has his cutter, and Wade Davis has both and some other stuff. All three are sturdy in how they go about their business, and all three have built a style batters can sense, but still can\xe2\x80\x99t hit. But none before are the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d closer today. Zach Britton is.  Why you ask, why do you say? Why is Britton better than perhaps, Alex Colome? Being nearly unhittable is probably why.

You have to be an ESPN Insider to read the entirety of his rankings, but the headline spoils the ending where he ranks Britton\xe2\x80\x99s sinker as the best pitch in today\xe2\x80\x99s baseball world.  Sarris\xe2\x80\x99 approval speaks volumes, given his profound want-to as a pitching/grip connoisseur, especially as he continues to travel from team to team politely bugging pitchers to show him their grips.     Even still, one pitch against Josh Rutledge in a one-run game may be all the proof anyone will ever need to cement Britton\xe2\x80\x99s sinking fastball as the nastiest pitch in baseball.  How does he do it? It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a pitch like his before. The 96+ MPH consistency is now a regular prerequisite to close games, but adding the kind of movement he creates is where the mystery beholds. And we aren\xe2\x80\x99t talking about just right to left fade or vertical sink, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a combination of both. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen with fastballs, especially one just south of triple digits.  What does that fastball do? Naturally, a diving fastball that moves down and in to lefties or sinking away from righties creates ground balls, and no one in baseball is better at forcing the ball to his infielders than Britton.  His 80.3 GB% leads the league, and as the reverse dictates, Britton\xe2\x80\x99s fly ball rate of 4.9% is tops as well. In a one run-game, is it harder to string together two or three hits or hope a ball in the air find its way over the fence?  Most closers find themselves in the 9th inning because they typically don\xe2\x80\x99t allow baserunners, but human imperfection is occasionally met with a mistake over the plate. A lot of grounders and a .180 BABIP can do a lot to a psyche, however.     One piece of of Britton\xe2\x80\x99s brilliance is his avoidance of fly balls. Opposing hitters have to hope that his sinker doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sink, and even then, the 95.3 MPH average fastball velocity creates room for error. Though most nights, the sinker does sink, \xc2\xaf\\_(\xe3\x83\x84)_/\xc2\xaf. That pitch is where he separates from the rest of the Joe-Flacco-is-elite closers. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to love some like Chapman and his flame-emoji fastball, but a straight 102 MPH fastball is THAT much easier to hit than 96-98 MPH with wicked-hawd tilt. It just so happens the numbers back it up.  In 13 more innings, Britton\xe2\x80\x99s whiff rate of 18.8% (3rd-best in baseball) is slightly ahead Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s 18.1%, while Britton\xe2\x80\x99s 39.7% chase rate outpaces Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s by nearly six percent (34.0%). Though Chapman gets less contact in the strike zone than Britton, Chapman is in the strike zone 16% more often (58.6%) than Britton.  Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s zone percentage leads all closers while Britton\xe2\x80\x99s 40.5% frequency in the zone is 14th-lowest. The numbers help to reassure that Britton excels at creating the illusionary strike, whereas Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s ever-explosive heater stays on the same plane.  Granted, both are phenomenal at what they do, but one dominates by throwing imaginary strikes, rather than having to. Conventional wisdom says you take that guy every time.     Other than Mariano Rivera being a lifetime Yankee, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find any fault with the way he operated for 19 seasons, leaning on one primary pitch. From 2009-13 according to PITCHf/x, Rivera threw his cutter 86.2% of the time to the tune of a 2.56 FIP. In comparison with Britton, who throws his sinker 89.8% so far in 2016, is on a three-year pace to an average 89.7% fastball frequency paired with a 2.33 FIP.  As Rivera proved, hitters can know what\xe2\x80\x99s coming and still swing with timidity, and Britton is doing it as well as anyone in today\xe2\x80\x99s era has ever done it.  For a team like the Orioles, a salvageable start can\xe2\x80\x99t be wasted, making Britton just the right kind of hero. As we saw on Monday night, an evening comprised of Chris Tillman dominance, Britton was tasked with coming into the game to record the last five outs.  Despite Hanley Ramirez sneaking a single up the middle to score an inherited run, Britton struck out four of the last five outs, including all three Red Sox in the 9th inning.  The most impressive of the five outs was the first batter he came in to face, David Ortiz. You can be mad at Ortiz for being whatever, or whoever he is, but the dude can still flat-out hit, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t often guys make him look bad. But most guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t Zach Britton.              <picture class=""c-picture"" data-cid=""site/picture_element-1494277917_113_5336"" data-cdata=\'{""picture"":true,""dynamic_picture"":false,""convert_picture"":false}\'>            <img srcset=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NR2vaWSbuBJ6wGEVMRkGq6Amc74=/0x0:718x404/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aHBbFJkGQA34hGq5_CcTAe_EMNs=/0x0:718x404/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wHvxAupBq7_O4A6Br9o3JvE8BJc=/0x0:718x404/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wfNirYQetN-5Zn4xajmRSuKHkeY=/0x0:718x404/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 920w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C2y_Z6-kRbRVvt6B2cz_mYXJrDc=/0x0:718x404/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 1120w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/17X1a39Gz_-wo17XRrTFnh7nWv0=/0x0:718x404/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 1320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/go4RYZfOUXpphMDRUVVXmbrhcvo=/0x0:718x404/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 1520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYs0NdjTMPs4nZl_aKOFSF8dKh0=/0x0:718x404/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 1720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gzGAmwB28o30uDTfvfdyUF10OtA=/0x0:718x404/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif 1920w"" sizes=""(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kQyOmnxBV8M4r3RvKVqfURzTSxI=/0x0:718x404/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6664181/gPcDbZi%20-%20Imgur.gif"">  </picture>         There is no person of our same planet that could possibly lay off of that pitch.

Hardy went on the disabled list May 2 with a broken left foot.Though Machado was drafted as a shortstop, he was converted to third base in 2012 at Class AA Bowie (Md.) in time to join the Orioles for the stretch drive as they made the playoffs for the first time since 1997. He played exclusively at the hot corner until last season when appeared in seven games at shortstop.\xe2\x80\x9cPlaying shortstop is what I did for basically 20 years, so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a big deal moving back there,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re a better team when I\xe2\x80\x99m at third base and J.J. is at shortstop, but my dream ever since I started playing baseball was to be a major league shortstop.\xe2\x80\x9dOrioles manager Buck Showalter was not surprised that Machado could make a smooth transition back to shortstop.\xe2\x80\x9cI never take Manny for granted, that\xe2\x80\x99s sure,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a special player, a special talent and special person.

Harper went first to the Nationals and the Pirates then selected right-hander Jameson Taillon, a well-regarded prospect who has yet to reach the major leagues while battling injuries.Machado has overcome having two major knee operations during his five-year career. After being injured late in the 2013 season, he had reconstructive surgery on his left knee in which a hamstring tendon was used to graft a replacement for a ruptured patellofemoral ligament. He had the same procedure performed on his right knee less than a year later when he was injured again in August 2014.     .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; }     p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYFate nudges Ian Desmond to center field - and now he may never leaveHe made a strong return last season and was the only player in the major leagues to play in 162 games.

From the beginning nothing has been plain and simple. He signed a major league contract straight out of the draft. Something that was seen as a good deal for everyone at the time. Touted as perhaps the most polished high school starting pitcher of all time, three years would be plenty to get him ready for the major leagues. He came up briefly in 2012 to pitch out of the bullpen as a 19 year old.     Then, as so often happens to pitchers, his elbow started barking at him and he had to get Tommy John surgery. His struggles have been immense since the surgery, never quite feeling the same as before. Fast forward to now, at least somewhat healthy and that major league contract came back to bite everyone.  The Orioles have to carry Bundy now that he is out of options and he is not rehabilitated enough to start. Therefore, we get bullpen Bundy. But, not fully loaded Bundy because his arm hurts when he throws his cutter and/or slider. Considering his cutter has been touted as his best pitch, that\xe2\x80\x99s worrisome.  As it stands, he\xe2\x80\x99s more of a fastball curve ball multi-inning reliever who gets his work in as he tries to reassemble the pitcher he was out of the pitcher he is now. However, he has been looking better of late. He\xe2\x80\x99s had six innings in June and six strike outs. Not a big sample size, but much better than earlier in the year so I wanted to see why.             Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s why. In case you were wondering, that is Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s month by month fastball velocity chart for 2016. As you can see, it goes up. From 94 mph in April to 96 mph in June. That will certainly help and that is the Bundy everyone dreamed about right after his draft.     It\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that he is still recovering and gaining strength. This is not the best situation, but for now at least some progress is being made.  Jonathan Schoop is Pretty Good Jonathan Schoop is a fixture in the everyday lineup. He\xe2\x80\x99s brought his line up to .268/.299/.463 in 2016 and is continuing to blister the baseball and play solid up the middle defense. I wanted to play my favorite arbitrary endpoint game and see where Schoop was over his last 162 games.     Well, his line is .271/.303/.468 good for a 106 wRC+ over that period of time. By the way, his last 162 stretches back to September 15th, 2014 due to his knee injury last season.  Unless Schoop starts to make more contact or starts to walk more, that line is probably his ceiling. Maybe something around a 110 wRC+ at his very best. But, that kind of line with his solid defense gives the Orioles exactly what they need. Someone who can play everyday give value to the roster at a low cost.  The Infield Defense I wrote a while back about how the outfield defense for the Orioles had been atrociously bad. It had been and pointing that out brought out some angst from the commentariat. To be fair, the Orioles won 11-3 the day before while hitting six home runs.     Not many were in the mood to hear about outfield defense. Regardless, the outfield defense has still been bad and ranks 29th overall in baseball with a -10.3 UZR/150 (you can read more about UZR/150 here).  But, I wondered, about the infield defense because the Orioles overall defensive rating was not quite as bad. It\xe2\x80\x99s harder to find because the Fangraphs leader boards do not allow to easily find the split for just the infield. But, using the magical powers of Excel, I can find it easily enough.  By subtracting the total team UZR/150 by the outfield's UZR/150 you basically get the infield UZR/150. This number still includes the pitcher and catcher, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the kind of time to separate all that out. The Orioles infield overall has a 5.8 UZR/150 which is the second best number in baseball behind the Cleveland Indians who have a 7.2 UZR/150 for their infield. It makes sense that the Orioles defensive strength would be the infield, but I was surprised to find just how good it is. I guess when you have Manny Machado and no one else does it helps a lot.

Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY SportsTyler Wilson and Eduardo Rodriguez were former teammates in the Baltimore Orioles system, but they found themselves pitching against each other in Boston on Thursday evening.On this occasion it was Wilson who got the win by pitching eight shutout innings, whereas Rodriguez took the loss in going 4.1 innings and giving up five runs. The final score was 5-1, with some big left-handed batter whose name escapes me getting a home run with two outs in the ninth inning for Boston.Rodriguez and Wilson were often together in the Orioles minor league system, that is, before the trade deadline deal in 2014 that sent Eduardo to the Red Sox for Andrew Miller. Whereas Miller was great in his two months with the O\xe2\x80\x99s, it has looked since then that the Sox were going to get the best of this situation, as Rodriguez put up some good numbers last year.But he has struggled more this year, as was evident last night. He now has a 6.97 ERA for the season, while Wilson saw his drop to 4.16. Both are learning on the job.It is interesting to see their paths on the same teams in 2013 and 2014. Rodriguez looked to be ahead of Wilson at Frederick in 2013. There he started 14 games with a 2.85 ERA, whereas Wilson started 11 games with a 4.22 ERA. However, both also moved up to pitch at AA Bowie. There Wilson had the better numbers with a 3.83 ERA in 16 starts, compared to Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99 4.22 in 11 starts.Clearly in 2014 it was Wilson who had the better year. Though both had 16 starts in Bowie, Wilson had the better ERA at 4.38 to 5.44 for Rodriguez. Beyond that, Wilson moved up to AAA Norfolk for 12 starts and posted better numbers with a 3.86 ERA and WHIP of 1.121. Out the door went Rodriguez.Two years later and they are facing each other at Fenway Park.It was a very fine outing for Wilson, even as we note that quite a few balls were hit hard and the Orioles defense had a highlights reel sort of game. But the idea of a good defense is to position well and make plays, while the pitcher pounds the strike zone with a variety of quality pitches. It works.Beyond the field of play, for my money, Tyler Wilson is the best interview on the team. He is a deeply thoughtful and analytical player. This is a guy who is going to learn and going to figure out how to maximize his ability. The Orioles need to keep running him out there, and in the end they are going to have an effective mid-rotation starter.Next: Evaluating Jonathan Schoop so far in 2016The road trip to Toronto and Boston ended at 3-4. We would have rather seen one of the Toronto games go the other way and make it 4-3. But I think we have seen the resurgence of a Blue Jays team that honestly should be the favored unit to win the AL East. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens with that, starting tonight in Baltimore. A series win would be a good thing right now for sure. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

06/19/2016,"[('Orioles ride season-high 19 hits to beat Blue Jays, 11-6 ...', ' The Orioles, in spite of their assorted flaws, are a good baseball team. This is a reality that cannot be denied as the Orioles keep racking up wins against quality competition. The offense went bonkers for all of the Birdland dads in the series finale against the Blue Jays on Sunday afternoon, giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s an 11-6 win over the surging Jays.    With this win, the Orioles have gone through a stretch of six games against their two closest division competitors by going 4-2 in those games. That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good, although for all of that, the O\xe2\x80\x99s still hold just a one game lead over the Red Sox, and the Jays are not far back at three games. As for today\xe2\x80\x99s game, it was a season-high 19 hits that fueled the Orioles over the Jays. They went 7-14 with runners in scoring position in the game. They needed a lot of those hits in order to keep up with the back-and-forth scoring early on and in the end they made use of the hits to build a nice cushion for a relatively safe finish. The first wave Toronto starting pitcher Marcus Stroman has had his struggles against AL East opposition this year. In his previous four starts within the division, he allowed 24 earned runs in 22 innings.    The Orioles welcomed Stroman to the game with two straight base hits, threatening early with no one out. A Mark Trumbo double play briefly gave hope to the Jays, but Stroman could not escape. Chris Davis singled in Adam Jones to bring the first run across the plate before Matt Wieters blasted his seventh home run of the season, putting the O\xe2\x80\x99s up 3-0 early on.    This lead did not last. Though Chris Tillman has been the best Orioles starter by ERA this season, he had his problems today - namely, problems with home runs. It was as if he saw that Stroman allowed the home run to Wieters and decided, ""I can give up more home runs than that!"" The result was that the Jays picked up two two-run home runs in the top of the second inning. Russell Martin doubled and scored when Troy Tulowitzki hit his ninth home run of the year. The dude has barely done anything this year, but when he does, it tends to be a homer.    No big deal, right? The Orioles still had a lead. Yeah, about that... Kevin Pillar got on with an infield single and then Devon Travis hit another home run, his third of the year, to put the Jays up 4-3. Travis was 3-3 with three runs driven in during the game. Some days putting the Orioles offense in a hole is only issuing them a challenge. Pedro Alvarez took up the challenge to start the bottom of the second inning with a single. He moved up to second base when Stroman tossed a wild pitch. Suspension substitute Ryan Flaherty drove in Alvarez in a curious play that resulted in Alvarez scoring and Flaherty being tagged out after going too far around first base. At least the run still counted. The game was tied. The second wave Tillman settled down from there. Although he only pitched for five innings, he held the Jays to five hits - four of them were concentrated in that second inning.    The Orioles offense, on the other hand, was not done with Stroman. They ambushed him again in the fourth inning. Wieters led off with a double and came home when Jonathan Schoop singled him home. The Orioles were back on top. Stroman got two more outs before his inning was derailed. Flaherty, only in the game because of Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s suspension, added to the O\xe2\x80\x99s lead with a double that scored Schoop - and Flaherty himself was driven in by Adam Jones to give the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 7-4 lead. That sent Stroman packing from the game. His final line saw him give up seven runs on ten hits in only 3.2 innings. Stroman has a 5.23 ERA and somehow has a 6-3 record. Wins and losses are dumb. But Tillman is now 10-1 with a 3.11 ERA so obviously that means he\xe2\x80\x99s good. The O\xe2\x80\x99s added an eighth run on three hits in the fifth inning. Wieters drove in Davis, who led off the inning with a double. The third wave An 8-4 lead did not mean the Orioles could rest easy. The Jays were not done scoring either. Though Odrisamer Despaigne pitched a scoreless sixth, he ran into a bit of trouble in the seventh inning. Tulowitzki and Travis doubles drove in another run. Another scored when J.J. Hardy took an error on a bad hop from a grounder hit by pinch hitter Justin Smoak.    Just like that it was 8-6. Things weren\xe2\x80\x99t over just yet. With two outs and a man on base and reigning MVP Josh Donaldson coming to the plate, manager Buck Showalter summoned Brad Brach - even though it was only the seventh. Brach was quickly 0-2 on Donaldson, then fell behind 3-2 before getting the clutch strikeout. After watching Zach Britton labor through an inning yesterday, this was enough to make you nervous - but only until the Orioles decided to score some more. They were not done socking around the Jays bullpen. The Jays brought in a lefty just to face Davis. He doubled - his third hit of the game. Up came Wieters, a triple short of the cycle. Wieters poked a grounder down the third base line, where the shifted Jays defense was not playing. Davis scored easily. Then Jays reliever Jesse Chavez left an 0-1 hanger to Jonathan Schoop and a very violent thing was done to that baseball. Just watch this video. Look where that ball lands! When, if ever, was the last time a ball went under the overhang in left field? Jays left fielder Michael Saunders never even bothered to start running. The measured distance was 458 feet but it\xe2\x80\x99s also possible they will need to replace a window at the Hilton.    Oh, and that meant it was 11-6 after Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s 12th homer of the year. Following the game, he told a reporter who asked if he got all of the homer, ""I think I got a little bit more in the tank."" I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see a ball go farther than that. The widened lead meant no need for Britton. The O\xe2\x80\x99s tried to push Brach the rest of the way for a 2.1 inning save - he entered in a save situation, after all - but Brach got to two outs in the ninth before he walked Travis. At 33 pitches, Buck decided that was enough for Brach. Brian Duensing retired the pesky Ryan Goins and the game was over. The O\xe2\x80\x99s head next for the one makeup game in Texas, which will be their second Machado-less game. Kevin Gausman draws the assignment for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, while Derek Holland starts for Texas in the 8:05 game. The Rangers have the best record in the American League.

A pair of first-place teams will square off Monday in a make-up game when the Texas Rangers host the Baltimore Orioles. The Rangers are squeezing in the contest \xe2\x80\x93 which was originally scheduled on April 17 but postponed due to rain \xe2\x80\x93 between a 10-game road trip and a two-game series that begins Tuesday at home against Cincinnati. They capped off the trip with a 5-4 victory at St. Louis, finishing a three-game sweep and setting a new season standard with six straight wins. Opponents have been held to 3.2 runs during the streak, but Texas pitching will be tested against the high-powered Baltimore offense, which cranked out a season-high 19 hits in an 11-6 win over Toronto at home on Sunday. Second baseman Jonathan Schoop homered for the second straight game and has four blasts in his last nine contests for the Orioles. Baltimore left town following the win but will return to Camden Yards on Tuesday to open up a six-game homestand. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (0-4, 4.14 ERA) vs. Rangers LH Derek Holland (5-5, 5.14) Gausman is winless in 11 starts and is coming off his worst outing of the season, a loss at Boston in which he gave up six runs in three innings. That left the 25-year-old at 0-3 with a 4.78 ERA in six road starts this season and 5-15 with a 5.10 mark for his career. Rangers designated hitter Prince Fielder is 4-for-8 with a home run against Gausman, who is 0-1 with a 3.68 ERA in three games (two starts) in his career against Texas. After posting four straight quality starts, Holland has given up 10 runs (nine earned) in 8 2/3 innings over his last two outings, serving up four home runs in the process. The 29-year-old is 5-2 with a sparkling 2.94 ERA in his career against the Orioles but has never faced them with Mark Trumbo \xe2\x80\x93 who is 14-for-45 with five homers against Holland \xe2\x80\x93 in the lineup.

The bottom rung of the baseball ladder. Soon, these rosters will fill up with recent draftees and some guys will lose their dream as the rosters are culled. For now, the rosters are made up of past draftees and international signings.     These are guys that are young and trying to break out looking for their first shot at full season ball next season. They have all had some more big league instruction and the Orioles hope that these few short months will prove that that instruction has paid off.  A few of the names are from last years draft. The Orioles in the 2015 draft picked up quite a few high school position players, including Ryan Mountcastle who is tearing up the league at Delmarva, that are populating this Aberdeen roster.  Also, some that have struggled with some injuries and an intriguing international signing or two. Below are five players that are currently on the Aberdeen roster, none of which are 2016 draftees. Alright, lets get into it.     Alex Wells Wells, 19, is one of those few international pick ups the Orioles have and while paying for talent in the Dominican Republic seems to go against their philosophy, not so for Australia. The Orioles spent $300,000 to sign Wells this off season. He has a twin brother, Lachlan, in the Twins organization.     I could not find much information on his arsenal, but the Orioles must have liked him to give him that kind of cash. Back in the spring, MLB.com\xe2\x80\x99s Lindsay Berra wrote about the Wells twins and had this tidbit from an O\xe2\x80\x99s evaluator:  Orioles director of player development Brian Graham would like to see Alexander command his fastball and spin his curve ball a bit more, but velocity is one thing about which Graham is not worried at all. ""With Alex, you like the body, you can see he\'s going to grow to be a big, strong kid, and his delivery is very pure,"" Graham said. ""I think his velocity will naturally increase, because he has everything correct -- from the mechanics to the delivery to the size.""     Wells, a right handed pitcher, did start Opening Night for the Ironbirds and went five innings giving up two runs, four hits, and a walk with four strike outs. Not so bad for a first pitch in professional ball.  Travis Seabrooke Seabrooke, a left handed Canadian pitcher, was actually the 5th round pick all the way back in 2013, but he is still only 20 years old. He has yet to break out of short season ball, but that is partially the fault of a freak ACL tear that put him out for all of 2014. He only threw 8.0 innings in 2013 as well, so going into last year he really had not pitched in two years. He had a 4.95 ERA in Aberdeen over 63.2 innings in 2015.  Not great, but at least he got through the season healthy. Now back in Aberdeen Seabrooke looks to get his career on track. He also has already pitched one game  in 2016 going 5.2 innings giving up five hits, one earned run with one walk and two strike outs.     Ryan McKenna McKenna was the 4th round pick for the Orioles in the 2015 draft. He is a right handed hitting outfielder who plays all over. He only played 10 games, hit for .636 OPS, last season and now he gets a chance to get some real playing time in.  McKenna went to St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Dover, New Hampshire. At only 19 McKenna\xe2\x80\x99s positional versatility and youth give him a shot to really move up some prospect lists if he puts up a good showing in Aberdeen. MLB.com already rates McKenna as the #20 Orioles prospect just for existing. Jason Heinrich Another high school position player, Heinrich was drafted a round later than McKenna in the 2015 amateur draft. Heinrich, a right handed batting first baseman, played 45 games in the GCL last season posting a .741 OPS.  However, Heinrich is already 20 years old so he needs a solid performance to shoot him up some prospect lists. A disappointing performance and Heinrich might be staring down another season in Aberdeen at the age of 21 with a waning prospect status.  Jaylen Ferguson Lastly, Ferguson\xe2\x80\x94who is also a high school position player\xe2\x80\x94was drafted in the 9th round of the 2015 draft. Ferguson, an outfielder, is only 18 during his second season in pro ball. A big advantage for the young man. He played in 48 games in the GCL last season and only managed a .618 OPS. Once again, a good showing at Aberdeen gives him a chance to see Delmarva next year to really make or break his prospect status.      Those are some names to watch as the season begins. As the 2016 draftees start to sign and trickle in the Aberdeen box scores will be the most interesting to watch in the Orioles system.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles waste chances, Gausman wastes run support in 4-3 ...', ' Baseball can really be an annoying game. The Orioles, as good as they can be, are not immune to this. They played one of those annoying games against the Rangers on Monday night in Arlington and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were losers by a 4-3 score.    The game happening at all on this day was annoying enough. It was, after all, a makeup of a postponed game. That postponement occurred even though, by the time it was the scheduled first pitch on April 17, the rain had stopped. So for literally no good reason, the Orioles were forced to disrupt their schedule, losing an off day for a one day trip to Texas. This was surely some kind of contributing factor in why the Orioles looked discombobulated at times. They probably were discombobulated. Not that it\xe2\x80\x99s any excuse, because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take away the loss from the standings, but it is something to cling to and think this won\xe2\x80\x99t happen in more ordinary circumstances. What makes it more annoying than anything is that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to be a bad game. Going up against the worst Rangers starter by ERA, Derek Holland, the Orioles had a prime chance to finally rack up some runs in support of a Kevin Gausman start.    The Orioles were plainly swinging early against Holland and they started to make that work in the second inning. Jonathan Schoop led off the inning with a single and he scored on a J.J. Hardy double, giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s the lead with no outs. Two more runs crossed in the inning, with Adam Jones driving in Hardy on a single and Joey Rickard driving in Jones on a double.    What would Gausman do with actual run support? Hold that thought for a minute. The bad news The very next inning saw the Orioles with a chance to add on even more runs. Mark Trumbo walked to begin the inning, and back-to-back singles by Matt Wieters and Schoop loaded the bases with no one out.     This is as prime of a scoring opportunity as you can get... unless you\xe2\x80\x99re an Orioles team that\xe2\x80\x99s not homering. Hardy struck out on a ball out of the zone and Nolan Reimold grounded into an inning-ending double play. Momentum is not a real concept, but sometimes it feels real, and blowing a bases loaded opportunity is one of those times where that kind of shift feels real. In the half inning after the O\xe2\x80\x99s wrecked their scoring chance, Gausman gave up a deep home run to center field to Ian Desmond - the 11th home run of the year for the Rangers unexpected center fielder. Whatever, it happens sometimes - good hitters get hits.    The problem was the next inning after that. Gausman began the inning by walking Prince Fielder. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing. Don\xe2\x80\x99t walk Fielder in 2016. He\xe2\x80\x99s bad and has no bat speed. Throw strikes. The guy is slugging .310. This was ridiculous. From here, Gausman started to fall apart in Ubaldan fashion, chucking up hittable pitches that the Rangers hitters didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss. They got their own bases loaded chance with one out thanks to Elvis Andrus and Mitch Moreland singling to put ducks all around the pond. No big deal, right? Gausman would just have to make some pitches against Bobby Wilson, the catcher and #9 hitter with a career OPS of .581. Gausman quickly got an 0-2 count on Wilson, but then Wilson started fouling off pitch after pitch, six foul balls in all, before finally lofting a ball to deep center field.  An easy sacrifice fly. The crappy-hitting catcher did what the Orioles could not and put the ball in the air. Oh, and with the slow Fielder running, Jones made the ill-advised decision to try to fire the ball wildly in towards the plate. This allowed the runner to advance from first to second as Fielder scored - the go-ahead run in scoring position. That proved crucial after the next batter, Shin-Soo Choo, pulled a single into right field. Had Moreland stayed on first, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way he would have scored. Instead, he scored easily to put the Rangers ahead, 4-3, which if you were paying attention earlier, you already know was the decisive run in the contest.    There were other wasted opportunities. The Orioles actually out-hit the Rangers in the game, 15-9, but they only batted 3-11 with runners in scoring position - and one of those hits didn\xe2\x80\x99t even score a run. Holland came out of the game in the fifth inning, relieved by Shawn Tolleson, who began the night with an 8.02 ERA in 24 games pitched. The kind of guy you want to do something against - like Reimold leading off the inning with a single. However, for some unknown reason, the Orioles decided to try a hit-and-run or run-and-hit or some other boneheaded play with Paul Janish at the plate. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try plays when Janish is the batter. Janish swung through a bad pitch to feel obligated to swing at and Reimold was thrown out easily at second base. Dumb. Janish later got a hit and did not advance further. For all of that, the Orioles managed to get the tying run to third base with only one out in the ninth inning. Chris Davis hit a single and with an impressive display of hustle, motored to third base when Trumbo followed with a hit behind him. There was some hope, but not for long. Wieters struck out. Schoop chopped a ball to third base for a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice and that was that. The Orioles lost. That\xe2\x80\x99s the bad news. The good news The good news is that the Orioles played a sloppy game full of wasted opportunities against the team with the best record in the American League, under less-than-ideal travel circumstances, while their best player, Manny Machado, was serving the second game of his four game suspension, and the Orioles only lost that game by one run.    That silver lining doesn\xe2\x80\x99t erase any loss from the standings, either, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something. Put in Machado and maybe they win. A couple of players make a couple of better decisions and maybe they win. Hope for next time. More good news is that while the Orioles were playing this game, the Red Sox blew their own gift scoring chance - it was even worse for them. In Boston, the game was tied 1-1 in the 9th and a White Sox reliever walked the bases loaded, but the Red Sox could not walk off and they went on to lose 3-1. So the O\xe2\x80\x99s lose no ground against their closest competition. Oh, and relieving Gausman was Dylan Bundy, who actually kind of looked good out there. Bundy finished off the final three innings of the game, big for saving the bullpen for the rest of the week. He retired all nine Rangers he faced, picking up three strikeouts. That\xe2\x80\x99s something. But the Orioles still lost, Gausman is still winless on the year, and they still have to fly right back to Baltimore and play a game again tomorrow night with no rest. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Padres coming to town for two games. Tyler Wilson is scheduled to start the 7:05 opener for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, with Luis Perdomo - he of an 8.79 ERA - taking the mound for the Padres.

06/21/2016,"[('The Orioles cannot win the World Series with this pitching ...', ' It happened again last night: the Orioles lost a baseball game in which their starting pitcher was below average, forcing the offense to win the game. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, falling 4-3 to the Rangers in Arlington.  This time it was Kevin Gausman. He went five innings and allowed four runs. If he did that every game, he would have a 7.20 ERA. It is a formula that has worked so far for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Through 69 games, they sit at 40-29 in first place in the American League East. But the pitching rotation cannot continue to be this awful. If it does, the Birds would be hard-pressed to make the playoffs and they would have no shot at winning the World Series. The 2016 season The Orioles have used just seven starting pitchers so far, but the numbers are not pretty. Here are their statistics when they start the ball game:         MLB.com   As a unit, they have an ERA of 4.97, the 27th-ranked number in all of Major League Baseball. The only three teams worse are the Rockies (5.15), Athletics (5.18) and Twins (5.61). That is the company the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers are in. Those three teams are all below .500 and will, in all likelihood, be watching the playoffs from home come October.    This is despite Chris Tillman putting together a really impressive season thus far. He has a chance to be an all-star, but advanced metrics suggest he is due for a slight drop in form (.263 BABIP, 4.05 FIP, 3.91 xFIP, 83.9 LOB%). What will the O\xe2\x80\x99s do if/when that happens?    Pitching wins championships...most of the time The Royals thumbed their noses at the idea that you needed at least one elite starting pitcher to win the World Series. Their rotation was mediocre all season as they finished 2015 with 4.34 ERA, which was the highest mark of any team that made the playoffs last year, but it is still 0.63 runs lower the O\xe2\x80\x99s current number. Here is the full list of 2015 playoff teams and their rotation\xe2\x80\x99s regular season ERA:    Cardinals - 2.99 (1st in MLB) Dodgers - 3.24 (2nd) Cubs - 3.36 (3rd) Mets - 3.44 (4th) Pirates - 3.53 (5th) Astros - 3.71 (8th) Blue Jays - 3.96 (12th) Yankees - 4.25 (19th) Rangers - 4.32 (21st) Royals - 4.34 (22nd) Kansas City also finished their World Series-winning regular season with the lowest-ranked (22nd) pitching staff of any team to take home the crown this century. Here is that full list of the recent World Series champs, their regular season starter\xe2\x80\x99s ERAs and the MLB rank for them:         The only other team during that time period that is even close to the 2016 Orioles awful number is the 2000 Yankees (4.87 ERA), but that was in the midst of the steroid era where everyone was juicing and balls were flying out of the park left and right. During this current time in baseball where pitching is en vogue, they have to do a better job.    Needs improvement These are the situations where the Orioles poor drafting and questionable trade decisions have left them in a tough spot.  In recent years, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have dealt away Jake Arrieta, Zach Davies and Eduardo Rodriguez: three MLB level players. Not that those deals did not make sense at the time (Andrew Miller was vital for the 2014 squad and Arrieta would never have won a Cy Young in Baltimore), but they still happened. They have signed guys like Ubaldo Jimenez and Yovani Gallardo to free agent deals, giving up draft picks in the process.  And they have drafted guys like D.J. Stewart, who, as a college outfielder, was expected to move through the system quickly. Instead, he has a .230 batting average with Delmarva and has just four home runs this season, one year after being selected in the first round out of Florida State. There is no one in the system to jump into the major league rotation and they have few pieces worth dealing that would bring back a significant return without further crippling the already barren cabinet that is their minor league teams.    Outside options Given that it is still so early, few teams will be looking to chalk up the season as a loss and start selling off pieces, but it may happen soon for some rebuilding organizations.  Jeremy Hellickson - an uninspiring choice. The 30-year-old has a 4.41 ERA for the rebuilding Phils. He is a former Rookie of the Year who knows how to pitch in the AL East. Andrew Cashner - 2016 has not been his year. Over 11 starts he has a 4.75 ERA, but the Padres stink and this season may have sunk his value enough for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to snag him. Tyson Ross - He has been hurt all season, meaning the Padres may be reluctant to deal him at the pit of his value, but again, they are bad and could ship him out Rich Hill- the Orioles should have signed him as a free agent anyway, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Now he is killing it with the A\xe2\x80\x99s. But he is 36 and it is a one-year deal so they may not have to give up too much for him. The unattainables - Julio Tehran and Sonny Gray. Two aces on bad teams. Tehran has been pretty good. Gray has struggled. Both could be put up for a king\xe2\x80\x99s ransom. The O\xe2\x80\x99s don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough to get this done unless the big prospects are put onto the table: Harvey, Manicini, Mountcastle. Not happening.  Long story, short. The Orioles are in trouble if they continue on with their current set of starters. Tillman will likely remain solid. Gausman has shown enough moments to encourage you, but outside of that it is anybody\xe2\x80\x99s guess. Who knows what to expect from the likes of Gallardo or Wilson? Jimenez is a lost cause. Worley is likely not a starter, but rather a valuable bullpen piece. And Mike Wright should be a late-inning reliever. This is a talented team who can mash homers and win close games with the lockdown bullpen. But the starting staff is losing too many games for them, and until that changes, the World Series dreams will never be realized.

', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Orioles bullpen collapses in 10-7 loss to Padres - Camden Chat', ' Baseball is often a very annoying game. Hits fall in. Someone is hot, someone is not. One game can seemingly hang on anything but the players on the field. Tonight was one of the more annoying nights of Orioles baseball this season which is especially unfortunate because last night was similarly annoying.     The Orioles lost tonight 10-7 to the Padres in a very painstaking and mind boggling manner. The scoring in this one started early and often. Tyler Wilson quickly gave up three hits right out the gate. Padres lead off hitter Travis Jankowski singled up the middle to lead off the game and would steal second base.  With one down, Matt Kemp flared a ball to right field to score Jankowski. Another single and a hit by pitch would load the bases for the Padres. But, with two down Wilson would get Derek Norris to ground out to finish the first inning. Somehow the Orioles were only down 1-0.    The Orioles offense early on looked perplexed by the Padres starter Luis Perdomo who was throwing strikes with crazy movement. Another no name starter looking good against the Orioles, but no so tonight. In the bottom of the third inning the Orioles offense would figure Perdomo out.     With two down Francisco Pena worked a walk and was doubled home by Adam Jones after Matt Kemp played a ball of the right field wall quite poorly. A wild pitch then moved Adam Jones to third base and Hyun Soo Kim would single him home on a ball that went through the shift. 2-1 Orioles.  Wilson would turnaround and give that newfound lead right back in top of the fourth inning. Derek Norris led off the inning with a line drive home run into the first row of seats in left field. 2-2 tied. Then with one down Alexei Ramirez doubled to left field and Will Myers singled him home with two down. 3-2 Padres.     Of course, the Orioles would come back and take that lead right back in the bottom of the fourth. A lead off single by Jonathan Schoop was followed by Pedro Alvarez taking a 1-2 pitch into the left field stands. An opposite field bomb. 4-3 Orioles. The Orioles managed to put some other runners on base in the inning, but would fail to capitalize on the opportunity. This would clearly come back to bite them.  Wilson would wriggle out a jam in the fifth inning and come in to complete the sixth inning easily, his only 1-2-3 inning of the night. Wilson finished with an admirable performance of six innings pitched, three runs, nine hits, one walk, and four strike outs.   The Orioles offense would add to their lead in the bottom of the fifth to bolster Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s lead. A Schoop walk followed by another monster Alvarez home run gave the Orioles a 6-3 lead.     The Orioles bullpen, and Mychal Givens as a part of that bullpen, has been terrific all year long. But, sometimes that guy you need is just not going to have it that night and the Orioles learned that in a big bad way tonight.  Givens came in and gave up three straight hits to let one run in and then walked two to let another run in. He faced five hitters and retired none of them and left the game with the Orioles leading 6-5. Givens lacked the typical crispness on his stuff and had little to no control. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day is sorely missed.  In came Oliver Drake with the bases loaded and none down. He did the best he could. A  first pitch wild pitch (that Pena should have blocked) tied the game and an RBI ground out (that Schoop booted to miss cutting down the runner at the plate) gave the Padres the lead. The damage done, 7-6 Padres lead. Hold me. I\xe2\x80\x99m weeping.  The Orioles had a good scoring chance in the bottom of the eighth inning loading the bases with two outs and Adam Jones at the plate. However, the Padres brought in their closer Fernando Rodney and he got Jones to ground out to second base and eliminate the possibility of a comeback. The Padres would go on in the top of the ninth inning to add three more insurance runs all off of Zach Britton (only one of which was earned) in a non-save situation who again struggled to get outs.     The final score was 10-7 Padres after the Orioles added a run in bottom of the ninth inning. Not a great night of Orioles baseball and one I hope to soon forget.  Join us tomorrow at 7:05pm for the final game in this two game set against Padres. The pitching match up as of now is Erik Johnson for the Padres and TBA for the Orioles (although all signs point towards Ubaldo Jimenez). An Orioles fan can hope that it will somehow be better.

Is it a matter of scouting and pitching adjustments being made to which he is not responding? Are the Orioles thinking about these sorts of questions?Much has been said about Trumbo being the second coming of the 2014 version of Nelson Cruz. This could be truer than folks realize. Statistically, Cruz had a terrible three months of June, July and August of that year. He only hit .213 for those months, though he did contribute 15 homers over the summer.

The injury-plagued Rays look to snap a seven-game slide when they visit the American League East-leading Orioles on Friday to begin the series.

Maybe it is for all I know. However don\xe2\x80\x99t look at it in that vain; consider what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying and ask yourselves if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that there\xe2\x80\x99s some truth to it.Manny Machado was suspended four games for the brawl with Kansas City\xe2\x80\x99s Yordano Ventura \xe2\x80\x93 who was suspended for nine games. However of course as we know, Ventura\xe2\x80\x99s nine game suspension represented only missing one start. While he was being suspended without pay for those nine games, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t eligible to be with the team, etc, he was only missing one turn in the rotation.As we also know, Ventura\xe2\x80\x99s suspension was eventually taken down to eight games. It still represented one turn in the rotation, however he was eligible to return to the team (and to collect a paycheck) one game earlier. Incidentally, this was negotiated between the player\xe2\x80\x99s union and the league \xe2\x80\x93 Ventura didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to go to an appeal hearing. When Machado\xe2\x80\x99s party asked for the same courtesy, the league was unwilling to do the same.\xc2\xa0Live Feed manny machadoBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenManny Machado mashes ball over Green Monster (Video) FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red Sox Call to the PenChris Sale reportedly to be suspended by MLB FanSidedBoston Red Sox Attempt to Hit Manny Machado--Again Call to the PenManny Machado rips the Red Sox for throwing behind him in NSFW rant FanSidedSo from the standpoint of many Orioles fans, Machado was in fact painted as the villain in a situation that in fact he didn\xe2\x80\x99t start. I don\xe2\x80\x99t buy the attitude which says\xc2\xa0Machado could have just taken first base and not caused a scene. That\xe2\x80\x99s blaming the victim, folks. If someone takes a cheap shot at you in public, you\xe2\x80\x99re well within your right to hit back with equal force in self-defense.Now with all of that said, the Orioles have also had their differences with MLB over the years. So\xe2\x80\xa6is there something else going on here? During the 1994 players\xe2\x80\x99 strike there was one owner who supported the players\xe2\x80\x99 union, and that was Peter Angelos. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard rumors over the years that many people in the commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s office look at Angelos begrudgingly to this day as a result of that. That was a long time ago granted, but work with me.As the call for baseball in Washington got louder, Angelos became more and more protective of what he deemed\xc2\xa0his territory. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m on record as saying that I always felt that the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital should have always had a team, and I still feel that way to this day. However from a strictly business perspective, one can understand Angelos\xe2\x80\x99 point. Whether they truly considered themselves Orioles fans or not, for years and years if Washingtonians wanted to see major league baseball they were coming to Baltimore.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerWhen push finally came to shove and DC was going to get a team, Angelos agreed not to sue the league in exchange for his mid-Atlantic Sports Network getting the TV rights to Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 games\xe2\x80\xa6in perpetuity. While from a business perspective Angelos\xe2\x80\x99 investment was in danger in a sense, many legal voices agree that had they gone to court he would have had no case in preventing a team from going to Washington. So needless to say, he fleeced the league in those negotiations.Fast-forward to now, and we have MASN, the Nationals, and MLB fighting over how much the teams get in rights fees. Not only has MASN seemingly beaten the league in court, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve publicly embarrassed MLB at times as well. A lot of the league\xe2\x80\x99s dirty laundry has come out in public due to this case, something that MLB probably resents.So again, is it not possible that the league picks and chooses how it \xe2\x80\x9cgets back\xe2\x80\x9d at Peter Angelos? Mind you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that this is right or fair. I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible. Baltimore was also apparently going to be awarded an all-star game in the near future, but that was called off in a very rushed manner. In fact, the league seemingly committed to giving NL parks all-star games in various consecutive years just so that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to hold it in Baltimore.The fact is that the resentment for Angelos in the league office is high. And in no way am I suggesting that this is Angelos\xe2\x80\x99 fault. Quite the opposite. While he\xe2\x80\x99s never been perfect as a team owner, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow the powers-that-be to walk on him. I respect that.However it just comes off to me as sometimes the league takes opportunities to let their opinion of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 owner be known without actually letting it be known. It\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous to me to think that Machado could be marketed into the aggresor in that situation \xe2\x80\x93 yet in how they seemingly handled the discipline, that\xe2\x80\x99s how it came across. Next: Baltimore Orioles, Ubaldo Jimenez rebound in victoryAnd the same is true of the all-star game. Why was that suddenly moved out of Baltimore before it was even awarded? Whether or not you side with Angelos or the league, there\xe2\x80\x99s something strange going on there. "", 'birdswatcher.com')]"

06/26/2016,"[('The Baltimore Orioles: Comeback Kids Extraordinaire', 'Jun 24, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles third baseman Manny Machado (13) scores on first baseman Chris Davis (19) (not pictured) three single during the sixth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Baltimore Orioles defeated Tampa Bay Rays 6-3. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are on the verge of a four-game sweep of the Tampa Bay Rays after logging two come-from-behind wins in the opening three games.The series got off to an ominous start on Friday night, as the Rays scored three times in the top of the first inning with their starting pitcher dropping the first 13 O\xe2\x80\x99s who came to the plate. But Tampa Bay would not score again over the next 17 innings, as the Orioles came from behind on Friday (6-3), while never trailing in the first game on Saturday (5-0).The second game of the doubleheader last night got off to another ominous start, as the Orioles and ace Chris Tillman fell behind early, 4-0. But the Orioles scored in six consecutive innings from the third through the eighth to prevail in the end, 8-6. Both teams had 14 hits, but the Orioles led in home runs (4-1) and in total team defense.Every starter for the Orioles had at least one base hit, with Matt Wieters getting three, including two massive home runs. Chris Davis and Adam Jones hit long balls as well.Years from now, anyone who looks back at this box score will see the homers by the Orioles and conclude that they were the story of the game. And yes, they were needed. But defense was the bigger story in reality, especially a diving catch by Adam Jones on a bases-loaded, two-out liner in right-centerfield. It that goes through, three runs score and we\xe2\x80\x99re writing a very different recap.Along with the regular fare of fine plays, Manny Machado also made a highlights reel, sliding catch of a pop-up along the wall. It was pretty amazing stuff. The Orioles turned three double plays, though they also hit into three twin-killings.Does it feel to you like the Baltimore Orioles hit into an inordinate number of double plays?\xc2\xa0 I have also felt this way over the years, though I\xe2\x80\x99ve concluded that it is the emotion of a disappointed fan in me that causes that sensation, along with seeing the Orioles play more than all other teams combined.The fact is that the Orioles are not exceptional in this category. Only four other teams (including the Rays) have hit into fewer double plays. And this statistic is a bit deceiving and not the most useful. The Rays have what is arguably the worst offense in the league, yet they have by far hit into the fewest double plays. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t get many people on base, you won\xe2\x80\x99t hit into as many double plays.This is very critical fault-finding, but when the Orioles took a lead of 7-6 in the bottom of the seventh, Showalter got Brad Brach up quickly to throw and come into the game. There simply was not enough time to get him ready, and sure enough he walked his first two batters. With the first of them being a lefty, the better move would have been to let him throw a bit longer while T.J. McFarland faced the leadoff hitter. But all\xe2\x80\x99s well that ends well. With three consecutive outs, the threat had passed and the Rays were doomed to see Britton in the ninth. Having thrown 26 pitches however, Brach is surely not available today, though many arms are fresh and ready to go.If you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see how feature article yesterday on just how good Brach has been this season, be sure to click below and check it out..theiaPostSlider_nav._lower{display:none !important}Related Story: How Good is Brad Brach?This is simply going to be a great summer of baseball fun to watch this Orioles team bomb away with long balls.

""It just seemed like every ball found a hole. They beat us up all series. They have a really good lineup, 1 through 9, they all hit home runs. They all have really high averages.

The Orioles are 7-2 against Tampa Bay this season, 6-0 at home.""This was a fun series,"" said Adam Jones, who went 4 for 4 in the finale. ""Obviously, we did a lot, scoring a lot of runs each night. But we just passed the baton. We fed off the guy in front of us.""The Rays have been outscored 72-29 during their skid and yielded at least five runs in each game.

""There\'s no doubt about it. You find out a little bit about each other. You find out about your club. Nobody\'s character is going away. We\'re staying positive.""Tampa Bay has six players on the disabled list, including four outfielders.""We caught them when they\'ve got a lot of people hurt and you\'re hoping to take advantage of it before they get out of town because the next time we seem them, trust me, they\'ll be a different club,"" Showalter said.Desmond Jennings and newcomer Oswaldo Arcia hit solo homers for the Rays, mired in their longest losing streak in seven years.

06/27/2016,"[(""Special shoe collection prized possession for Orioles' Jones"", ""View photosThis June 7, 2016 photo taken in Baltimore, Md., courtesy of Adam Jones show Baltimore Orioles center fielder Jones' prized possessions, his rare Doernbecher Jordans, named after the acclaimed Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland, Ore. (Adam Jones via AP)MoreHOUSTON (AP) -- Adam Jones recently procured the final pieces of an extremely rare shoe collection.Just how exclusive is this footwear?Even with a multimillion-dollar salary and the perks that accompany fame at his disposal, it still took Baltimore's All-Star center fielder four years and a shoe-sleuthing crew of 10 people to complete the extraordinary and special collection: Ten pairs of limited edition Doernbecher Air Jordans made by Nike.''They're my prized possessions,'' Jones said.Sure, he admires the look and the exclusivity of the sneakers, but that's far secondary to the meaning behind these kicks.Their name is derived from the acclaimed Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland, Oregon, where kids with illnesses from cancer to kidney failure work with Nike on the designs. The collaboration has raised more than $14 million for the hospital since its inception .''Everybody knows who Michael Jordan is and the impact that Jordan has, and by them going out there and doing this and having those kids feel extra-special is what it's about,'' Jones said. ''Obviously I'll do anything for kids and having them feel that way, being able to create a custom pair of shoes that most of their peers wouldn't have a chance to do is truly a blessing for those kids.''One of the final pieces to his collection might be the one that means the most.The Doernbecher 5s were created by Isaac Arzate, a preteen basketball and baseball player who went into cardiac arrest during basketball practice. An undiagnosed abnormality was discovered and open-heart surgery followed. He designed the shoes in 2012 while in rehabilitation at the hospital, but before they were released the 12-year-old died after a second heart attack.The sleek black shoes feature Arzate's basketball and baseball numbers, have his initials and the dates of his birth and death on the tongue, and heartbreakingly feature a few words from a poem he wrote the day before he died. The shoes also come with a small flashlight which emits a UV light causing them to glow in the dark.The Doernbechers retail from between $150 and $250, but were going for much more than that with releases that were often less than 1,000 pairs. Jones acknowledged spending $2,500 on a pair.''The shoe will never get made again, so I look at it as I'm blessed to be able to throw money away like that,'' he said. ''I'm just blessed to find a passion. I like shoes. I like Jordans so, hey, it's all part of it.''Jones enjoys fashion and thinks about style, but his overarching theme when dressing is comfort. For instance, he likes the look of skinny jeans but won't wear them because they're constricting. He swears he's worn the same suit for 98 percent of travel days in his 162-game baseball season over the past 2 1/2 years because it ''feels like pajamas.''And when he's not in his beloved Doernbechers you'll often see him in chic low top sneakers from French designer Lanvin. He adores them in large part because they feel good on his size 12 feet.''I can't find any red bottoms that fit me too well, they're too hard to find and they're too expensive sometimes,'' Jones said, referring to the ubiquitous crimson soles on Christian Louboutin's creations. ''The Lanvin are priced pretty high, but they're very comfortable and durable. So I've spent some money on them.''He has about six pairs of the shoes that range in price from $490 for the suede and patent leather ones he wore on the day he spoke about his fashion to his most extravagant non-Doernbecher shoe purchase of a $1,200 animal-print pair.And with all his fabulous shoes, Jones has to have a top-notch sock game. He has about 40-50 pairs of statement socks that feature everything from mustaches to hot dogs and hamburgers. This collection was born from his penchant for browsing Amazon.com out of boredom on some of those endless nights on the road.It took some time for the 30-year-old Jones to hone his style.''I've always been simple,'' he said. ''Growing up I didn't have all the clothes I wanted so I always had to mix and match and try to make things look good and go together. I would just switch things up to try and make them look different.''He shakes his head remembering a gaudy and oversized diamond necklace he bought as a rookie. It was the first big wardrobe purchase he made when he started receiving a major league salary. But he sold it when he realized it simply wasn't him.Read More''It was too much,'' he said. ''It was more of an impulse purchase like: 'Oh, I can do this. I can hang with the big boys purchase,' and I just realized that I don't need to do that to be a big boy.''He's now partial to more subdued jewelry that turns heads not for being overboard but because it's so unique. He recently commissioned his jeweler to create four diamond charms and necklaces that are identical except in color.''They're literally like plugs that come out of the electrical socket and I got them all diamonded out,'' he said of the collection that includes one with white diamonds, a black diamond one, one featuring yellow diamonds and one in rose gold with diamonds, which together set him back about $7,500.They're certainly eye-catching, but why plugs?''I really got them because people ask me for stuff all the time in terms of where can I get this? Where can I get that and how can I get this?'' he said. ''And in today's day ... it's called being the plug. So I consider myself the plug. So if you ever want anything, need anything, If I ain't got it, I can get it, if I can't get it, I know somebody that can get it. So everything's accessible. That's the motto I take.''

06/28/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Looking Back at the Tampa Bay Series', 'Jun 25, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Chris Davis (19) celebrates with teammates after scoring in the seventh inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Baltimore Orioles defeated Tampa Bay Rays 5-0. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAfter the Baltimore Orioles swept the Rays this past weekend, is there really substantive reason for encouragement about this team and this season?Even with a four-game sweep, five straight wins, and a four-game AL East lead, there is no one who can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory quite like O\xe2\x80\x99s fans. But really, how great is it to have beaten a team that came into the series with a seven-game losing streak already in the works?There is no doubt about it, the Tampa Bay Rays are not a very good baseball as currently constructed. To be honest, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think they were that great before all of the injuries occurred, but that\xe2\x80\x99s another topic for another day. (However, if you have not seen last night\xe2\x80\x99s scores, they clobbered the Red Sox 13-7 on 18 base hits.)Yet this is a major league team. At their worst, MLB teams still win a lot of games. Over the past three years (going back), the worst of all teams were the Phillies with 63 wins, the Diamondbacks with 64 and the Astros with 51. So it is still a big deal to sweep a series of four games.Here are some raw numbers from the Tampa By series: the Birds outscored the Rays 31-14. Baltimore had 50 hits in 139 at-bats for a .360 average, along with nine home runs. There was one great start, one okay start, and two poor outings; but the bullpen was great as always \xe2\x80\xa6 well, most always. The relievers threw 13 scoreless innings, giving up eight hits and six walks.So we now have the Orioles team we pretty much expected to see. They out-bomb everyone, hitting 120 home runs \xe2\x80\x93 eight more than Seattle and 12 more than Toronto. Their batting average is third-best in the American League, with a second-best OBP. The bullpen is among the best, though we all know the starting rotation is hit and miss as expected.I\xe2\x80\x99m not a huge believer in WAR and Wins Above Average statistics, but they do illustrate the truth above. The Orioles have a team Wins Above Average (WAA) of 6.6 which ranks them third in the A.L. behind Cleveland and Boston. The bullpen WAA is 3.5, a full point ahead of the next best team (Indians). And the offense for the O\xe2\x80\x99s is 3.3 and good for second-best. But the starting pitching is -0.2 and ranked eighth in the league (which is actually not as bad as you might expect to see).So what does this hold for the future? There is a lot to like in what has happened. And while the starting pitching is a concern, so also is the need to win on the road. The Orioles have now played more than half of their 2016 home games, sporting a great record of 31-13. But they are 14-17 on the road, the place they go now for nine games on the west coast.

Several Orioles will potentially be back in San Diego in a couple of weeks when the mid-summer classic is held there.

Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before, however here\xe2\x80\x99s my take: fans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be voting. I recognize that even with home field advantage in the World Series on the line, this game is still mainly an exhibition for the fans. So the adverse argument of course is why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the fans decide who plays?And my response to that is because it\xe2\x80\x99s a popularity contest. First off, some teams have bigger fan bases than others. So if all of their fans vote the allotted number of times, it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious who\xe2\x80\x99s players will be on the roster \xe2\x80\x93 whether they deserve it or not.

A true professional isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to choose player A over player B simply because he plays for his team. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to vote for a player at each position who truly deserves to be there \xe2\x80\x93 because that\xe2\x80\x99s what professionals do.

Tonight and tomorrow afternoon, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will square off in the greatest city in the history of mankind: San Diego.              <picture class=""c-picture"" data-cid=""site/picture_element-1494277992_7907_256"" data-cdata=\'{""picture"":true,""dynamic_picture"":false,""convert_picture"":false}\'>            <img srcset=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zaatCwmSLX-xtkfYw4iqRPULT_8=/0x0:500x271/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:500x271):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6716131/giphy%20(51).gif 320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6pNPTTcV6FIiDrzB5m_qWdX0KtA=/0x0:500x271/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:500x271):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6716131/giphy%20(51).gif 520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axKo1N23TkASWW4CBCrkc65JcE0=/0x0:500x271/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:500x271):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6716131/giphy%20(51).gif 720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LsGvGGn9zUBZ1eaKymLdjSftokY=/0x0:500x271/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:500x271):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6716131/giphy%20(51).gif 920w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AHwwY2LzWGWNRzMpVh0rl0U9y8U=/0x0:500x271/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:500x271):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6716131/giphy%20(51).gif 1120w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hu_HYJIBETVjlFjxg8MN1Ls6JXc=/0x0:500x271/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:500x271):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6716131/giphy%20(51).gif 1320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M_fYwHmv9s5PIpH2lkPyPmjxSdc=/0x0:500x271/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:500x271):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6716131/giphy%20(51).gif 1520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O7FAMzFpC4fXSkosKd9nPz082JU=/0x0:500x271/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:500x271):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6716131/giphy%20(51).gif 1720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EfH35Ajz1dr977DxMB5hqocd3eU=/0x0:500x271/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:500x271):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6716131/giphy%20(51).gif 1920w"" sizes=""(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0f0bSoIosmY9uw-Ry5JMLlreunQ=/0x0:500x271/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:500x271):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6716131/giphy%20(51).gif"">  </picture>         Drink it in. It always goes down smooth.  Game 1: Ubaldo Jimenez (4-7, 6.97 ERA) vs. Erik Johnson (0-5, 8.54 ERA) So, about Ubaldo. The last time he was afforded an opportunity to start was June 22, against these same Padres. In his sincerest form of flattery, Jimenez pitched, according to his game score (62), his third-best start of the year, allowing only two runs on four hits over six innings. He threw more two-seam fastballs (31%) than he had for most of this year, also exchanging the splitter with the slider. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say if that\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of things to come, because who really knows, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to tell Jimenez was much better finding the radius of the strike zone, despite the four walks. As for Erik Johnson, his last start was in opposition of Ubaldo on June 22, where he was tagged for six runs over four innings. One of the pieces in the recent James Shield trade, Johnson is a primary fastball-slider righty who owns a very high contact rate of 84.9%. The Orioles feasted on him before, including home runs from Mark Trumbo and Ryan Flaherty, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to believe they won\xe2\x80\x99t again.  Game 2: Yovani Gallardo (2-1, 6.04 ERA) vs. Christian Friedrich (4-2, 3.60 ERA) Speaking of high contact rates, for all starting pitchers with at least 20 innings pitched, Gallardo\xe2\x80\x99s 86.9% contact rate is 10th-highest in baseball. For a guy who gives up a lot of contact, his BABIP (.340) is also .44 points higher than league average, which is also not good. To his credit however, in his last start against the Rays, Gallardo shook off three first inning runs to keep the Orioles alive before the bats swarmed for a 6-3 win. Gallardo is never going to make pitching look pretty, because it\xe2\x80\x99s all by design. He knows he can\xe2\x80\x99t live around the middle of the plate. Still, If he continues to pitch five or six innings allowing two or three runs, it really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how it looks.     Christian Friedrich is actually pretty interesting. A former first-round pick of the Rockies, Friedrich kind of flamed out with Colorado and was signed by the Padres on a minor league deal heading into 2016. He\xe2\x80\x99s bounced back in San Diego, throwing a lot more two-seam fastballs and curveballs. Not a hard thrower, Friedrich\xe2\x80\x99s fastball hovers around 90 MPH, so the Orioles are going to a see a lot of baseballs moving every which way. Friedrich is a good story, and for his sake let\xe2\x80\x99s hope it continues, but maybe his road to redemption hits a fork in the road when the O\xe2\x80\x99s come to Petco. Just for one afternoon.   ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The Baltimore Orioles are one home run away from matching the most hit during the month of June in major-league history and look to tie or break the record on Wednesday, when they complete their two-game series against the host San Diego Padres. Baltimore belted three shots in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s 11-7 victory to raise its total for the month to 54, just one shy of the mark set by the 1996 Oakland Athletics. Hyun Soo Kim hit a two-run shot while Chris Davis and Adam Jones launched solo blasts in the series opener as the Orioles increased their major league-best homer total to 123. Kim recorded three RBIs while Davis, Manny Machado and Jonathan Schoop each notched three hits and two RBIs as Baltimore racked up 17 hits while registering its sixth consecutive win. San Diego learned Tuesday that it will be without starting center fielder Jon Jay (.296 with 24 doubles, the latter tied for the National League lead) from four to six weeks due to a broken forearm. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s tough to replace, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that,\xe2\x80\x9d Padres manager Andy Green told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous leader, he goes about his business the right way. He was great at the top of the order.\xe2\x80\x9d PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Yovani Gallardo (2-1, 6.04 ERA) vs. Padres LH Christian Friedrich (4-2, 3.60) Gallardo is 1-0 with a 4.35 ERA in two starts since returning from a nearly two-month stint on the disabled list. He has put the shoulder issues behind him and is hoping to again resemble the durable hurler who started 30 or more games in each of the past seven seasons. Gallardo is 4-4 with a 4.08 ERA in 12 career starts against the Padres and has struggled versus Brett Wallace (9-for-21, one homer) and Matt Kemp (9-for-25, two homers). Friedrich has experienced back-to-back shaky outings even though he defeated Cincinnati in his last turn. The 28-year-old has allowed 10 runs on 15 hits and six walks in 11 innings during the stretch after giving up eight earned runs over his first six outings. Friedrich has struggled at Petco Park this season, going 2-1 with a 5.57 ERA in four starts.

06/30/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles and Home Run Records', 'The Baltimore Orioles could break the record on Thursday night for the most home runs in the month of June, a record they currently are tied for.To say the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense has been powerful this month is an understatement.The team has hit 55 home runs this month, tied with the 1996 Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s for the most in the month of June.All of that got me thinking as to whether this team has a chance at some other home run records.We all probably know the major league record for home runs in a season is 264, set by the 1997 Seattle Mariners. Right now the Orioles are on pace to hit 259 home runs in the season.That would leave the team just shy of the record. But, it is worth mentioning that with the warmer weather, the ball will carry more, and more home runs should theoretically be hit later in the season than in the early months.However, one also has to consider if the O\xe2\x80\x99s can keep this current pace up.\xc2\xa0 Regardless, it will be close.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are on pace for 137 home runs on the road. The AL record is 136, set by the 1996 Orioles team. The major league record is 138, set by the 2001 San Francisco Giants.\xc2\xa0 Both of those numbers are certainly within reach.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are on pace for 125 home runs at home, which would put them 13 home runs behind the AL record at home, set by the 2012 New York Yankees. That one might be a stretch.The record for most 20 home run hitters on a team in a season is seven, set by several teams including the 1996 O\xe2\x80\x99s. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the team can quite reach that.Mark Trumbo is currently at an MLB leading (tied with Todd Frazier, who went deep Thursday) 23 HRs. Chris Davis has 19, Manny Machado has 18, Adam Jones has 16, Jonathan Schoop has 13, Pedro Alvarez has 9, and Matt Wieters also has 9. With Alvarez as a part-time player, it will be tough, but not impossible.The record for most 30 home run players in a season is four.\xc2\xa0 This is certainly in reach, as Trumbo, Davis, Machado, Jones and Schoop could all get to 30 easily.The record for most 40 home run hitters in a season is two, by numerous teams. Could the O\xe2\x80\x99s break that record? \xc2\xa0Could Trumbo, Davis, Machado and or Jones get to 40? We all know that Davis has already hit 40 in his career.Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s highest is 34, but he is on-pace to destroy that mark this season. Manny\xe2\x80\x99s highest is 35, last season. He is already half way to that total.Thursday night, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will take their last swings at another record, one that franchise already holds. That is the record for 58 home runs in a month.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Hitting baseballs for Kim as easy as Hyun, two, three ...', ' So, two nights ago, when the Orioles prequeled their 12-6 win with a 11-7 win that concluded deep into the night, you could really tell Padres\xe2\x80\x99 starting pitcher Erik Johnson wasn\xe2\x80\x99t having much fun.     His body language was sour, his face was pouty, but I guess inning after inning of missed spots and whiplash can do that to just about anybody. Well, in the top of the 5th inning, after J.J. Hardy singled, Hyun Soo Kim stumbled to the plate.  Kim had an interesting plate appearance in the top of the 3rd inning, where he lined a 106 MPH line drive to center field, only to be robbed by Melvin Upton Jr., who decided to have the best three innings of his life that night.  So, Kim goes through his pre-swing routine, steps into the box, sees a first-pitch fastball and WHAMMY! He belted his second-career big league dinger over the right field fence, a 108 MPH laser that Upton Jr. deemed unworthy of his Mr. Fantastic powers. Johnson, who did more stargazing than pitching, aimed his two-seamer JUUUUUUST a bit narrow.             Immediately following the home run, my dad texts me, saying only:    \xe2\x80\x9cKim Kim Kim\xe2\x80\x9d Responded by:  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my guy!\xe2\x80\x9d And it\xe2\x80\x99s true. He is my guy.  Orioles fans have been lucky in 2016. To name a few, the expedient plate maturity of Jonathan Schoop, Mark Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s bombastic transition to Baltimore, and Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s blossoming into truly one of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s top three or four players have encapsulated the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 current 47-30 start. The O\xe2\x80\x99s debunking Jay Jaffe and the entire CBS Sports staff is a labeled mountain the Orioles understand, but time and again are fit to climb.  Heaping deserved praise on the trio is well-earned, but to understate the impact of Hyun Soo Kim is to undermine just his frustratingly unique transition to Major League Baseball. Forget the infamous 0-23 spring start, polite declination to Triple-A and sparse early playing time. Despite the initial obstacles, Kim has actually made hitting big league pitching look, well, look easy.             Sometimes the term \xe2\x80\x9cspray chart\xe2\x80\x9d can be misplaced, because you kind of expect a \xe2\x80\x9cspray\xe2\x80\x9d to represent more of a mess, but in Kim\xe2\x80\x99s case, messy is good. Perhaps the single most impressive aspect of Kim\xe2\x80\x99s game thus far has been his acceptance of left field.  Pitchers have made a concerted effort to pitch Kim away with the hard stuff, and he\xe2\x80\x99s had no issue going the opposite way. You\xe2\x80\x99ll often hear hitters, TV guys and others say a hitter is really \xe2\x80\x9cseeing\xe2\x80\x9d the baseball well when they succeed the other way, and the fundamentals behind it are easily understood.  In summation, by letting the baseball travel deeper into the zone, the bat head doesn\xe2\x80\x99t drift . Someone like Pedro Alvarez has a habit of lunging over the plate to reach the outside pitch, and as soon as his top-half collapses bending over to hit the outside pitch, he forfeits his power.     Kim is one of the best in baseball at remaining tall in his stance, trusting his quick hands to cover the outer-half of the plate, all encompassed by his extreme hand-eye coordination. If pitchers want to pitch Kim away, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue going away.  Some may look at his .390 BABIP, the seventh-highest figure in baseball among hitters with at least 130 plate appearances, as much to do with his salacious start, but BABIP can mean a lot of things. Yes, there have been a lot of squeaky ground balls that have found holes, some of which can be attributed to luck.  Kim does boast a very respectable 91.6 average exit velocity however, a figure higher than the likes of Mookie Betts, Chris Davis and Kris Bryant. Fangraphs\xe2\x80\x99 Jeff Sullivan wrote about Kim\xe2\x80\x99s deceptive ground balls, hits categorized as ground balls but more or less should be considered line drives. His extreme BABIP probably has more to do with his innate ability to hit the baseball harder than most. That isn\xe2\x80\x99t luck.  The swing-and-miss nuances that come with slugging prowess help to define the Orioles, but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t Kim\xe2\x80\x99s game. He\xe2\x80\x99s one of only seven players with a BB/K% of at least 1.00, and among his colleagues, sits only behind Chris Davis (13.7 BB%) in terms of walk percentage (11.7%). The Orioles were looking for furthered on-base capabilities, and Kim has brought it.  What leads to more walks and solid contact? A tremendous batting eye. According to PITCHf/x, Kim\xe2\x80\x99s 25.9% chase rate is well below the 30.2% league average, while his overall swing percentage of 39.4% also outlays the base average of 46.3%.     Yet somehow, Kim boasts an above-average zone-contact rate of 90.1%, as well as an extremely high O-Contact rate of 79.2%. Evidently, Kim uses his swings efficiently, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s a meatball over the plate or fouling off pitches to stay alive, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t one to swing just for the sake of swinging. He\xe2\x80\x99s calculated in his efforts.  Kim showed all of his plus traits in the at-bat following his second home run, this time against veteran reliever Carlos Villanueva. As good as Kim has been, this was arguably his best at-bat thus far as an Oriole.  Villanueva started Kim with a hittable curveball, though he fouled it off down the first base line. Kim then took a deceptive changeup for a ball, fouled off a hanging curveball, laid off a diving changeup in the dirt, followed by fighting off another changeup fading down and away.  On pitch six, he finally saw a fastball, sending it straight back to the netting, only to be trailed with a slider down and in, also fouled back. On pitch number eight, however, Kim laced a pretty good slider middle-away down the left field line for an RBI double.           <picture class=""c-picture"" data-cid=""site/picture_element-1494271463_4936_2367"" data-cdata=\'{""picture"":true,""dynamic_picture"":false,""convert_picture"":false}\'>            <img srcset=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2rbGn7x__bp1jtcd_flQLuqw1R4=/0x0:720x404/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7VvOBx1XWk8z8AheQRceCd29vE=/0x0:720x404/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kdRGF4OXYeBBCDMFDsG0QPMjxZg=/0x0:720x404/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VJzlC3EitTw613RaLGOYasENWVI=/0x0:720x404/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 920w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NJKZykQxQ_-xW5B18Tg2pME3m4I=/0x0:720x404/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 1120w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xFBk9QTUWu_mpRR6G-2Ax-1qiM0=/0x0:720x404/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 1320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DhOUzlmp5j2FcRtSEhHL46Gojtg=/0x0:720x404/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 1520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4OeTEm5IZ-i9YNkOXd7DcTtcE8s=/0x0:720x404/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 1720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/coIzF__tE0MrlxYAMnSZHmXq7_4=/0x0:720x404/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif 1920w"" sizes=""(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qx4hY-cDcW8lgwVU-XJmBm79aHY=/0x0:720x404/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:720x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6727791/Eo4ZZGC%20-%20Imgur.gif"">  </picture>         Taking tough pitches, staving off strike three, letting the baseball wander into the depths of the strike zone and using the whole field, all gift-wrapped into one eight-pitch double.

The Orioles, with a number of impressive multi-home run games out of their last several, have been steadily pulling themselves within striking distance of this record.    Until Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s three home run performance, it seemed like the kind of dream you could joke about how it would be cool if they did it, but without ever thinking it might happen - especially with a Monday off day representing one fewer chance to hit more home runs.  As it turned out, the off day didn\xe2\x80\x99t slow them down at all. Another three home runs in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s game in San Diego suddenly left them one home run short of the record with two more games still to play. Enter Mark Trumbo in the fourth inning of yesterday afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game, with the Orioles holding what was at that time a narrow 2-0 lead. And what does Trumbo do? He hits dingers, like this:     (function(){var f=document.getElementById(""d4038""),a=parseFloat(f.getAttribute(\'data-aspect\')),w=f.offsetWidth,h=Math.round(w/a),s=f.getAttribute(\'data-src\');f.removeAttribute(\'id\');s+=\'width=\'+w+\'&height=\'+h;f.setAttribute(\'src\',s);f.style.height=h+\'px\';})();  Not only did this give the Orioles a share of the record, it also gave Trumbo sole possession of the MLB lead in home runs for the 2016 season, at least for now. Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s home run was his 23rd of the year, pulling him ahead of Todd Frazier of the White Sox and Adam Duvall of the Reds, each of whom have 22. Another three players have 21 home runs. The Orioles will face the Mariners tonight with one last chance to claim the record all for themselves. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get cocky here, under any circumstances. That said, I will leave you with this fact: Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Mariners starter, Taijuan Walker, has allowed 14 home runs in 75.2 innings pitched this season.    I just told you not to get cocky, and what did you do?

Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles just don\xe2\x80\x99t quit, and that has allowed them to be in games that otherwise, they might have already lost.Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at Thursday night\xe2\x80\x99s game, as an example.I woke up with my soon-to-be two-month-old son at 1215 a.m. to feed him, to see the O\xe2\x80\x99s were losing 4-0 to the Seattle Mariners.My first thought, to be honest, was that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good news for Chris Tillman and my fantasy team.After that, I wondered whether the team would be able to mount yet another late-inning comeback.The Orioles have 24 comeback wins in 2016, easily the most in Major League Baseball. In fact, in more than half of their wins, they came from behind.The team also has scored more runs in the 7th inning (65) than any other inning.All of this means the O\xe2\x80\x99s are a team that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shy away from pressure. \xc2\xa0When the O\xe2\x80\x99s are down, don\xe2\x80\x99t count them out.Which is why I tuned in Thursday night, especially after seeing Hyun Soo Kim hit a solo home run off Taijuan Walker while I was preparing my son\xe2\x80\x99s bottle.Then the 8th inning came along, with the Orioles again down four after a strange error call on a double by Nelson Cruz put him at third base, and a double play was overturned because Jonathan Schoop wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the bag.Schoop walked, but was still on first base with two outs. \xc2\xa0Then Adam Jones singled, Kim singled in Schoop, and Manny singled in Adam.Even as Chris Davis struck out with men on first and second, I still felt like the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a run left in them in the ninth inning.

Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have dropped the first two of four games in Seattle and the offence has quieted. Why is this?As always, when the offence disappears for any time, the opposition pitching likely has a lot to do with it. Seattle pitching against the Birds has been quite good, as has their pitching throughout the first half of the season. The Mariners rank third in the American League in ERA and fourth in strikeouts and K/BB ratio. This is the sort of staff that can give the O\xe2\x80\x99s some problems if they are pitching well at all.But the Orioles are helping them out. Baltimore batters have struck out 11 times in both of these first two Seattle games. And we are seeing again some of the wild, overly-aggressive swings at balls well out of the strike zone. Jones, Machado, Alvarez in particular have about swung right out of their shoes on occasions. Why throw a strike when batters do this?At the same time, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have squared-up some balls right at people, as Jones did in the first at-bat last night \xe2\x80\x93 a screamer right at the third baseman. It sorta set the tone. And the Mariners made some especially good defensive plays on Thursday evening.It is no secret that the Orioles need to find a way to win on the road. While being 31-13 at home, they are now 16-19 on the road. The rest of the season from this point forward features 37 home games and 46 away from Baltimore.It would be good also to figure a way to score more against these Mariners and get a couple wins. In five games against Seattle, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have only won a single contest back in Baltimore. And the Birds have scored but 12 runs in the five games. Has this always been a problem?Here is a look at the past four years, noting the seasonal series record, how the Orioles did in Seattle, and the total runs scored by the two teams\xe2\x80\xa6YearSeries@ SEAO\xe2\x80\x99s-M\xe2\x80\x99s20153-31-224-2320145-23-118-1420132-41-229-3520128-15-149-29\xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/8 - Baltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters Suits Up for His First Game Against Orioles5/8 - Baltimore Orioles Player Profile: Aderlin Rodriguez5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels As often appears in studying recent Baltimore history, the great years of 2012 and 2014 have good-looking numbers, whereas the struggles of the odd-numbered seasons can be seen even in the split being considered.So the Orioles need to put together a couple of wins in these final games.

Hardy\'s two-run double pulled Baltimore to 4-3 in the fourth, but Ketel Marte had an RBI double in the bottom half and Jimenez balked with two outs and runners at the corners, breaking his hands and stopping his motion when Martin took off to steal second.Seattle had 31 runs and 47 hits, including 23 for extra bases, in sweeping the AL East leaders.""We\'re getting in good counts. Even when we\'re not, we\'re not giving up at bats,"" Seattle manager Scott Servais said.Hisashi Iwakuma (8-6) allowed four runs and 10 hits in six-plus innings.Trumbo had an RBI single against Edwin Diaz in the seventh, cutting Seattle\'s lead to 6-4.

A walk, a bloop, and a brain fart by Ubaldo on a bunt loaded the bases for the present day Barry Bonds, who hit his fourth home run in as many games against the Orioles this series.  The fifth inning saw two more runs scored, including one on a balk by Jimenez where he totally forgot there was a runner at first, and when said runner took off for second Ubaldo just stopped, mid-pitching motion, and stared blankly at the field before him.  Can they really give Jimenez more time in the rotation? But then who do they even give a shot to at this point? I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know. Ariel Miranda? Joe \xe2\x80\x9cThe Gunk\xe2\x80\x9d Gunkel?     Speaking of Miranda, he made his major league debut today! So that was kind of exciting. He took over for JImenez in the fourth inning and then pitched two scoreless before falling apart in the seventh inning. He was looking good until three straight doubles by Nelson Cruz, Kyle Seager, and Adam Lind.     Still, he did OK for a few innings and he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t totally worn out his welcome yet, so why not give it a try? Ah, who even cares.  The O\xe2\x80\x99s offense looked like they were going to get the team back in the game in the top of the fourth inning. Mark Trumbo hit a majestic home run in to the third deck in left field and later in the inning J.J. Hardy doubled in two more runs.     Hardy looked pretty good at the plate with a single and double, but the basepaths were another story as he limped around them looking like someone had Nancy Kerrigan\xe2\x80\x99d him before the game.  Hopefully word to come on whatever that was about.  Other than that inning, the game was mostly missed opportunities. They wasted baserunners in every inning including a first and third, no outs situation in the seventh.  It was an ugly game and just another example of the bad pitching that has plagued the Orioles the entire season for the most part.     The O\xe2\x80\x99s are now 2-4 on their west coast road trip and tomorrow start three games against the Dodgers before finally coming home.    ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles pitching prospect Matthew Grimes has had one of the lowest ERA stats in the country and has been rewarded with a promotion to AA Bowie.I will ask the readers today to forgive the unusual first-person narrative style of this article. For the past three months, my wife and I have had the privilege of hosting Grimes in our home during his time with the Advanced \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d Frederick Keys. So this is something of a personal story as well as information about a rising prospect in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 system.Grimes is in his third season with the Orioles, having been an 18th-round selection out of Georgia Tech in 2014 and playing immediately with the Aberdeen Iron Birds. There he was 1-3 with a 5.32 ERA in 10 games, five starts. Last year under the outstanding tutelage of Delmarva pitching coach Blaine Beatty, Grimes went 10-7 in 24 starts with a 4.14 ERA.But it is the current season that has put his name on the map in the Orioles farm system. Over 14 games with the Keys, he went 8-4 with a 1.45 ERA, earning Carolina League All-Star status while being named the league\xe2\x80\x99s player of the month in May.A few days ago, Matthew learned that he was being moved up to the Baysox and pitching on Monday night for their July 4th game. Originally scheduled as the starter for this game was Jayson Aquino, who we have now seen has been called up with the Orioles.So Matthew stayed here with us for one last night, got in an hour of fishing with two of my boys, and then packed up his gear to head down the road for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game. He\xe2\x80\x99s movin\xe2\x80\x99 on up to the East Side \xe2\x80\xa6 yes, the east side of the District to pitch for the Bowie Baysox.Playing against the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 AA affiliate the Trenton Thunder, Matthew was rudely welcomed to the Eastern League. Leadoff batter Tyler Wade took an 0-2 pitch deep over the wall for a leadoff home run. But Grimes came back from that to strike out the next three batters. Going a total of 4.2 innings, he gave up three earned runs on six hits (mostly ground balls through the infield) and struck out seven, leaving with a 3-1 deficit.Relying this evening mostly on fast balls and a nasty curve, the appearance was an overall decent outing. The Baysox radio announcer summarized it this way \xe2\x80\xa6The numbers are not going to look great, but I thought that Grimes threw the baseball really well in his Eastern League debut, especially given the rainy conditions throughout the game.Regarding pitching in the rain, from Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, his experience in Maryland is that it rains all the time. I have been telling him that this year is unusual, but it is difficult for him to believe it when it does indeed seem to rain just about every day, as he says, \xe2\x80\x9chere in the north.\xe2\x80\x9dIt was just starting to rain when he was leaving our house, so I have told him that he is the rain magnet, not us!Just after Grimes departed the game, the rain came down harder in Bowie and there was a delay. Again, the announcer said \xe2\x80\xa6It\xe2\x80\x99s kinda frustrating when you look at the radar and see that this is just about the only place in the country where it is raining.\xc2\xa0 Well of course! Matthew Grimes is there! The rain follows him with a storm cloud over his head, kinda like Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh.So is Grimes a legitimate prospect for the Orioles, sooner or later? Even though it is like talking about one of my own kids, I think I am being objective in saying that he certainly is. I have watched him pitch multiple times, and he features four pitches that he commands well. Pounding the strike zone, he only gave up 16 walks in 81 innings at Frederick, with a 1.054 WHIP.Grimes is not listed among the top 30 Orioles prospects in Baseball America. Though there are more than a few MLB players who have been 18th-round or later draftees, guys after the opening rounds have to prove that they can do it, while those at the top have to prove that they can\xe2\x80\x99t.At the same time, it has from the beginning of my knowing Matthew confused me as to why his successes this year are spoken of as a \xe2\x80\x9csurprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s why I say that: Grimes was a fourth-round selection in 2010 out of high school in Georgia, by the White Sox. Ranked at that time as among the best high school pitchers in the country, he chose rather to go to Georgia Tech.At Tech, he suffered the very common young pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s elbow injury, going through Tommy John surgery and the subsequently long recovery. This year is his first without some measure of restriction, now being fully recovered from the worst thing that could happen. He throws consistently in the low 90s, occasionally touching 95. He\xe2\x80\x99s obviously healthy.So it is reasonable in my mind to see Grimes as a true high pick in the draft, only dropping due to the injury. Therefore he is a bargain for the Birds.Orioles fans would look at Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s delivery and approach and immediately notice a similarity to Chris Tillman. The mechanics are similar, as is the 6-6 frame. Throwing \xe2\x80\x9cdownhill\xe2\x80\x9d and using size to his advantage, he actually has better ball movement than does Tillman. His curve, when working, can be devastating. The change is excellent and a slider is in development as a probable put-away pitch of the future. Add command to all of this, and it is a very viable MLB pitching package.

There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one offering over the course of the entire weekend that Seattle didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have a shot at hitting \xe2\x80\x93 and hitting far, at that. To drive that point home, at one point yesterday Jimenez was conned into a rookie mistake \xe2\x80\x93 balking in a run after a base runner took off. That\xe2\x80\x99s the type of weekend it was for the Orioles.Jimenez wasn\xe2\x80\x99t strong in the wake of two decent outings. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.1 IP, 6 H, 6 R, 3 BB, 3 K. He actually started this game off strong, not allowing a run for the first two innings. In many of his struggles, Jimenez has had troubles from the beginning. However he loaded the bases with nobody out in the last of the third, and Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s Smith happily obliged by hitting a grand slam. Again, Seattle had to have really studied whatever the Orioles were throwing out there coming in \xe2\x80\x93 Smith homered in all four games of this series.However the good news for the O\xe2\x80\x99s is that they battled back \xe2\x80\x93 and quick.\xc2\xa0Mark Trumbo smacked his 24th homer of the season in the top of the fourth, to get the Birds on the board.\xc2\xa0Later in the inning\xc2\xa0J.J.

Marte hit a ground-rule RBI-double (when the ball got lodged under the fence), and Jimenez balked in the aforementioned run. Again, that sixth run was typical of this series. Martin took off for second in a steal attempt, and Jimenez stopped his windup \xe2\x80\x93 resulting in a balk. While that\xe2\x80\x99s the type of mistake we\xe2\x80\x99d expect of a rookie, we do have to keep in mind that human beings are still playing this game. And as I said, that\xe2\x80\x99s just how things went for the Orioles for the entire weekend.Trumbo would add an RBI-single in the seventh to bring the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within 6-4. However two RBI-doubles by Seattle in the last of the inning sealed the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fate. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say why the Birds struggled against Seattle this season, as they dropped two-of-three in Baltimore, and all four in Seattle.

That was more than enough for the Bulls, who held Norfolk to just four hits on the day.    The only run for the Tides was an old-school manufactured run in the first. Xavier Avery singled, stole second, advanced to third on a groundout to the right side, and was singled in by Christian Walker. After today\xe2\x80\x99s loss, Additon moves to 1-9 on the season. Although he did deserve the loss in this one, that record is pretty unfair overall - even after yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s start he has a perfectly reasonable 3.58 ERA on the year. Oliver Drake also got back to doing what he usually does in the minors by striking out five over two scoreless innings. Altoona Curve (PIT) 5, Bowie Baysox 3 Starter David Hess had a decent outing, allowing three earned runs in 6.1 innings, but he was finally chased in the seventh when a few hits and a pair of ill-timed errors allowed the Curve to turn a 2-1 lead into a 5-1 advantage.    Bowie tried to come back the following inning, when Joey Terdoslavich singled in Tucker Nathans and Henry Urrutia, but that was as close as they\xe2\x80\x99d get. The two unearned runs were the difference, as the final score ended up being 5-3 in favor of Altoona.    The other Bowie run came on an RBI single by Nathans in the third - he was 3-4 on the day. Urrutia and Terdoslavich each had a pair of hits, and Urrutia\xe2\x80\x99s eighth-inning double  was the only Baysox extra-base hit on the day. Salem Red Sox (BOS) 4, Frederick Keys 1 The Keys were held off the board until they were down to their very last out of the game, when Jomar Reyes hit a 2-out solo shot in the ninth to break up the shutout.     The offensively futility wasted a pretty good, albeit short, effort by starter David Richardson. In a spot start, Richardson allowed just one run over four innings, with seven strikeouts. Garrett Cleavinger, last year\xe2\x80\x99s third-round pick, allowed the other three runs (one of which was unearned) in 3.2 innings of work. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Cleavinger\xe2\x80\x99s best outing, but he\xe2\x80\x99s still got a 1.68 ERA overall across Delmarva and Frederick this season. Wynston Sawyer and Jomar Reyes each went 2-4 and had the Keys\xe2\x80\x99 only two extra-base hits. Josh Hart, who is somehow still only 21, went 0-3 in his return from a few weeks on the disabled list. He\xe2\x80\x99s been struggling this season, with a .192/.260/273 batting line in 174 plate appearances. Delmarva Shorebirds 7, Hagerstown Suns (WAS) 0 The Shorebirds picked up the affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 only win of the day thanks to a dominant start (7.1 IP, 5 H, 8 K, 0 BB, 0 R) by Francisco Jimenez. After a rough start to the year, the 21-year-old Dominican has allowed just a single run in his last 22.2 innings, lowering his ERA from 6.04 to 4.42.    Delmarva did all their damage in just two innings. They had just one hit entering the fifth, but that changed quickly. Ricardo Andujar led off with a walk, and Gerrion Grim followed with an RBI double. After an Ademar Rifaela walk and an Austin Anderson strikeout, Cedric Mullins tripled home a pair of runs. Ryan Mountcastle and Yermin Mercedes followed with back-to-back singles, chasing the Suns\xe2\x80\x99 starter from the game. That was all they\xe2\x80\x99d get in the fifth, but they added three more runs in the seventh on a pair of RBI doubles by Alex Murphy and Nataneal Delgado, and an RBI single by Ricardo Andujar. I feel like I mention Yermin Mercedes every time I do one of these, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to change today. After going 2-5 yesterday he\xe2\x80\x99s now hitting .349/.395/.452 on the year. Lowell Spinners (BOS) 3, Aberdeen Ironbirds 1 Aberdeen starter Alex Wells had another nice game, allowing just one earned run (two runs total) on four hits in 6+ innings. The 19-year-old Australian now has a 1.48 ERA in his first four career starts on this continent - not too bad. The Ironbirds scored their only run in the second, when Guillermo Salas singled in Jaylen Ferguson. Aberdeen managed only five hits on the day.

Since then, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have won two more World Series (in 1970 and 1983) and the Dodgers two more as well (1981 and 1988). If the last memory you have of the Dodgers is Kirk Gibson fist-pumping while hobbling around the bases in 1988 that probably means two things: 1) You\xe2\x80\x99re old like me and 2) You don\xe2\x80\x99t watch much National League baseball, also like me.    These aren\xe2\x80\x99t Kirk Gibson\xe2\x80\x99s Dodgers - they aren\xe2\x80\x99t even Don Mattingly\xe2\x80\x99s Dodgers, as the former Yankees player and Dodgers manager parted ways with the club last off-season. Yasiel Puig has come back down to Earth, Clayton Kershaw is injured (as are about 73 other starting pitchers for Los Angeles) and because the Seager brothers haven\xe2\x80\x99t tormented the Orioles enough, Corey Seager leads the team with a 142 OPS+. DISCLAIMER: I grew up an Orioles fan and a Dodgers fan. The Orioles will always come first, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a game in Chavez Ravine, but I was heartbroken when those Damn Yankees beat the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978. Sure, 1981 helped soothe the hurt, but that was a strike year and didn\xe2\x80\x99t really count. 1988 did. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be rooting for the boys in Orange and Black, of course, but the rest of the year? Love Ya Blue, too. And check Twitter for their lineup tweets - they are seriously good. On to the games because ITFDB... Game 1: July 4, 9:10 PM Eastern Yovani Gallardo vs Julio Urias The Dodgers rookie came up to much acclaim, and his first seven starts have been uneven but getting better. He lasted just 2.2 IP in his debut, and left with an ERA over 10. In his last start, he allowed just two runs in 6.0 IP against Milwaukee, although he allowed six walks in that last start. He\xe2\x80\x99s passed the Matusz test every time he\xe2\x80\x99s pitched, with his ERA going down after every start. Then again, when you start with a ERA greater than 10, maybe that isn\xe2\x80\x99t as impressive as it looks. None of the Orioles have faced him, obviously. And here\xe2\x80\x99s the bad news - he\xe2\x80\x99s left-handed.    Yovani Gallardo has won two of his three games started since his return from the disabled list and was no-decisioned in the other. But as Buck Showalter says about Mike Wright\xe2\x80\x99s minor league starts, the results have been better than the pitching. He\xe2\x80\x99s pitched to a 4.43 ERA in those three starts, has allowed nine walks in those 16.1 IP, and surrendered three home runs. To his credit, he\xe2\x80\x99s struck out 14, but that\xe2\x80\x99s some serious luck coming into the equation to get the results he\xe2\x80\x99s been getting.       Game 2: July 2, 10:10 PM Eastern Chris Tillman vs Kenta Maeda OK, raise your hand if you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard of the Dodgers starter. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought. Yet another rookie pitcher from the Dodgers, but this one\xe2\x80\x99s right-handed. He\xe2\x80\x99s been awfully good, with a 2.82 ERA for the season. His WHIP is just 1.090, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a strikeout to walk ratio of 3.18K/1BB and has 89 strikeouts in 92.2 IP. That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good rookie season. Chris Tillman has been seen as the steady presence in the O\xe2\x80\x99s lineup until his last outing, when he did his best Ubaldo Jimenez impersonation. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t last five innings, gave up four runs and took 112 pitches to do it. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of pitches, especially considering he walked only three batters.

However injuries and overuse have tamed that a bit.Gallardo had a lead last night at Dodger Stadium, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to stick around long enough to even have a shot at the win. Gallardo\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4 IP, 6 H, 4 R, 3 BB, 5 K. In fairness, both Gallardo and LA\xe2\x80\x9ds Urias were affected by the strike zone, which appeared to be both floating and very small. Both were lifted early due as much to pitch count as anything else.J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s two-RBI double in the second inning gave the Birds a 2-0 lead early. Later in the inning\xc2\xa0Adam Jones would add an RBI-single, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were on top of things from the getgo. However back-to-back solo homers by Los Angeles tamed that feeling a bit, butting the lead to 3-2. As I said however, the strike zone was incredibly small all night.

Have a safe Tuesday. Go Orioles!  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Five Orioles selected to American League All-Star team', ' The All-Star votes have been counted and the teams have been announced. When everything was said and done, the Orioles had one position player among the starters: third baseman Manny Machado. It\xe2\x80\x99s his third selection to an All-Star team. They ended up with five All-Stars in all.    American League home run leader Mark Trumbo missed out on the starting lineup after coming close in the voting, though given how the voting was going, that\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising.  The AL starters in the outfield who edged out Trumbo were Mike Trout, Jackie Bradley Jr., and Mookie Betts. While everyone was busy worrying about Royals getting in, a red tide washed over the outfield. In the end, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter too much who\xe2\x80\x99s a starter and who\xe2\x80\x99s not, because most everyone will get at least a bit of a chance to get into the game. The Orioles landed another few players in among the reserves.    Though he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a starter, Trumbo is in after all as a reserve. It\xe2\x80\x99s the second All-Star selection of his career, the first time he\xe2\x80\x99s made the team since 2012 when he was on the Angels.    Matt Wieters will also be representing the Orioles on the All-Star roster. It\xe2\x80\x99s his fourth career All-Star team. For a second consecutive season, Zach Britton will be in the bullpen of the AL team. The AL roster is loaded up with elite AL East relievers.    A bit more of a surprise is Brad Brach making the All-Star team. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for a non-closer to get enough attention to make his way onto the team. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day pulled off this trick last season, and now Brach despite being a 7th inning guy or setup man has still been deemed great enough to be an All-Star. Brach is an All-Star for the first time in his six year MLB career. It\xe2\x80\x99s impressive for the O\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen. Britton has a 0.80 ERA, with Brach having a 1.01 ERA. No one can say they don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it. So that\xe2\x80\x99s five Orioles All-Stars in all. It\xe2\x80\x99s fun to have All-Stars. They all deserve it. Some others have a fringe case and perhaps they could sneak on if there are injury issues to the initially-selected squad. Hopefully all of these Orioles All-Stars can help them stay in first place for the rest of the season.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
07/06/2016,"[('Orioles out-last Dodgers over 14 innings for wacky 6-4 win ...', "" When a relief pitcher bats with the bases loaded, two outs, and the tying run on second base in the 14th inning, you know that a baseball game has gotten weird. The Orioles, fortunately, came out on top when all was said and done, beating the Dodgers, 6-4, in a 5+ hour game to close out their west coast road trip.    In the end, O\xe2\x80\x99s closer Zach Britton, perfect in save chances so far this season, induced a little tapper from pitcher Chris Hatcher. Britton almost fired high to first base, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and the game was over, preserving his perfection. Thank goodness for that. Before that, Jonathan Schoop was the hero. Batting against Hatcher in the top half of the inning, Schoop, hitless in the game up to that point, had both Manny Machado and Chris Davis on base ahead of him. Each had singled. Schoop lined a ball that fell in front of Dodgers center fielder Trayce Thompson. Running with two outs, and thanks to the ball being misplayed a bit, both Machado and Davis were able to score on the play, giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s the 6-4 lead that held up the rest of the way.    How the game got there The game went on for long enough that nothing at the beginning mattered all that much. Starting pitchers Kevin Gausman and Bud Norris were gone from the game for a full nine innings before things ended.    If you only look at Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line in the box score, you\xe2\x80\x99d see four runs in five innings, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound very good. And for sure, he made at least one big mistake, giving up a first inning home run to Justin Turner to put the Orioles in an early 2-0 hole. The Dodgers touched up Gausman for two more runs in the fifth inning. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit harder to blame him for this one. Well, OK, it was Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s fault that Chase Utley doubled and Corey Seager walked. Gausman induced the weak contact that he wanted from Adrian Gonzalez with two outs.    The ball had other things in mind and it floated right into the Bermuda Triangle between shortstop, center field, and left field. Adam Jones made a desperate dive and roll to try to come up with the catch. He came up short and looked a bit shaken up in the attempt. This put the Orioles down 4-3. The O\xe2\x80\x99s had actually grabbed the lead back from Norris and company. The first run was unexpected: Ryan Flaherty, starting in place of J.J. Hardy, drove in Mark Trumbo with a double in the second inning. They tied it up in the third as Jones led off with a single and aggressively took third base when Hyun Soo Kim singled behind him. That meant he could score on a double play ball hit by Manny Machado. Trumbo gave the Orioles the lead briefly with a Trumbomb in the top of the fourth, though the 3-2 lead didn\xe2\x80\x99t hold for long. Luckily, Trumbo wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done being awesome for the day: He re-tied the game in the sixth inning, greeting the first Dodgers reliever, Casey Fien, with another Trumbomb. He now has 26 home runs for the year. That\xe2\x80\x99s our All-Star coming up big.    A true bullpen parade By the time the game ended, the Dodgers were on their ninth pitcher and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were on their seventh. This left the Orioles in a bit better shape as the game went along because they were better able to ride out the long game - several relievers went for multiple innings. It was actually Dylan Bundy who relieved Gausman in the sixth inning. Bundy racked up a couple of impressive innings, getting seven outs, all of which were strikeouts. He had to work around some trouble, ending up with the bases loaded in the seventh inning before getting two strikeouts to get out of the jam. For extra difficulty he even started out Howie Kendrick with a 3-0 count with two outs and the bases loaded before battling back for the strikeout. Much as there was panic in certain quarters about Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s lack of strikeouts earlier in the season, he now has 32 in 38 innings. No panic there. All-Star Brad Brach picked up from Bundy with one out in the eighth and went on through a scoreless ninth as well. The O\xe2\x80\x99s kept Zach Britton in reserve in case the O\xe2\x80\x99s took a lead. It\xe2\x80\x99s not always the smart decision, but it worked out in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game. Odrisamer Despaigne, Vance Worley, and Mychal Givens combined to pitch four innings and none of them blew the game. Meanwhile, the Orioles successfully outlasted the good Dodgers relievers - Fien, Adam Liberatore, Joe Blanton, and Kenley Jansen, among whom the highest ERA is 2.66, pitched an inning apiece. That left them in position to win against Hatcher, who came into the game with a 4.75 ERA and failed the Matusz Test.    The Windmill lives again The Orioles had what was at that point the go-ahead run cut down at the plate to end the thirteenth inning. What compels a third base coach to try to get a runner - even a fast-ish one like Joey Rickard, who\xe2\x80\x99d pinch hit for Worley and singled - to score from first base on a two out single is one of those things we\xe2\x80\x99ll never know. What made it even worse is that the ball, hit by Jones, went almost right to Yasiel Puig in right field. Perhaps coach Bobby Dickerson was banking on Puig doing something screwball, as happens with him from time to time, but he hit the cutoff man and the cutoff man had the ball in to the catcher at home in plenty of time to tag out Rickard. This was a terrible decision that thankfully didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt the Orioles. The pitchers came up huge when they needed to. Dodgers batters were 1-14 with runners in scoring position in the game, with the only hit being Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s Royalesque two-run cheapie. The Dodgers stranded 16 men on base and actually out-hit the O\xe2\x80\x99s, 16-13, in the game. Trumbo had three hits and scored three of the Orioles runs. Jones, Kim, and Flaherty all had multi-hit games as well. Was it a lucky win? Maybe. The Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t much better with RISP, going only 2-11. They came up big in a big spot first, thanks to Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s game-winning RBI double. Good teams get lucky wins. It\xe2\x80\x99s not an accident the Orioles went in and beat Los Angeles, another good team, two out of three games. They are good. That's what good teams can do.    After all of that, the Orioles escape their west coast trip with a 4-5 record. It\xe2\x80\x99s not great, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll bring a division lead of at least 2.5 games back east with them. They\xe2\x80\x99ll next be in action on Friday night against the Angels, when the O\xe2\x80\x99s will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the 1966 World Series-winning team. Ubaldo Jimenez may end up being the starter for that team, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t scream celebration, but hey, who knows what\xe2\x80\x99ll happen. Matt Shoemaker, who dominated the Orioles the last time they saw him in Anaheim, will pitch for the Angels in the 7:05 game.

Orioles won 6-4 in the 14th inning. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles finished a difficult West Coast road trip by winning an epic bullpen battle over the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-4 in 14 innings.There is a reason why the Dodgers are the best come-from-behind team in the National League, while the Orioles are the same in the AL. It has to do with bullpen strength, an impressive asset for both squads. This is increasingly becoming the recognized methodology for building a contending team in Major League Baseball.On Wednesday, the collision of the two bullpens was the baseball equivalent of the immoveable force running into the irresistible object.Both starters \xe2\x80\x93 Kevin Gausman and Bud Norris \xe2\x80\x93 were out of the game after pitching five innings each. The bullpens would battle for nine more innings, throwing shut-out frames until finally the O\xe2\x80\x99s broke through with a pair of runs in the top of the 14th inning. By the time it was over, the Orioles would use six relievers, whereas the Dodgers would go through eight \xe2\x80\x93 the final one needing of necessity to come to the plate with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the 14th.\xc2\xa0 Epic.As with any long, extra-innings game, there are some amazing numbers. Chase Utley proved himself as a leadoff hitter, going 6-for-7 (How many times has a guy ever done that in a losing effort?). Between the two teams there were 36 strikeouts, 18 for each side. The Dodgers had more opportunities, with 16 hits and seven walks; but they were 1-for-14 with runners in scoring position. The O\xe2\x80\x99s 2-for-11 looks very offensive by comparison!A total of 123 batters came to the plate. The combined number of pitches thrown for both sides equaled 526 (249 for the Orioles and 277 for LA). This accounts for the game lasting 5:26. The Orioles can be thankful for the day off on Thursday, flying home to Baltimore.Practically every player for the Orioles had very high and very low moments in the game. Mark Trumbo hit homers 25 and 26 on the year. Jonathan Schoop was 0-for-6 before getting the game-winning double, knocking in two runs.

At this point the O\xe2\x80\x99s could really use a couple of long starts against the Angels in the final three games before the All-Star break. What are the chances of that?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles trade rumors: Scouts watched Sonny Gray, Ervin ...', ' The idea that the Orioles are going to have to trade for someone to try to improve the state of their starting rotation gets more support almost on a daily basis. It seems so unlikely that they could hold their slim division lead with that unit continuing to pitch the way it collectively has.    Two big linked questions are out there. Who can the Orioles actually get with their limited trade chips? And just as important, would any of those people represent a meaningful upgrade? There will be plenty of time to figure that out between now and the non-waiver trade deadline. For now, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to know just who the Orioles might be looking at as a possible upgrade. On Wednesday, they had their eyes on both starting pitchers in a game between the Athletics and Twins: Sonny Gray and Ervin Santana. That\xe2\x80\x99s according to the San Francisco Chronicle\xe2\x80\x99s Susan Slusser. The Orioles are hardly the only team that might be interested in one of those players as a potential rotation option. Slusser reported that the Blue Jays, Royals, Marlins, and Cardinals also had scouts in attendance. Any one of those teams could offer more than the Orioles without meaningfully depleting their farm systems.    Sonny Gray Gray, aside from having a name that fits perfectly into the cadence of the beginning of the Sesame Street theme song, has long been figured to be a trade chip this season because he\xe2\x80\x99s relatively young, coming off of two full successful seasons, and on top of that, the Athletics team is going nowhere.    In each of the past two seasons, Gray topped 200 innings pitched and his combined ERA in those games was 2.91. There was a lot to like even for those who prefer more abstract measures of evaluating pitching, with Gray\xe2\x80\x99s FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching) being 3.46 in the past two seasons.  That\xe2\x80\x99s not Cy Young-winning material but it\xe2\x80\x99s still very good. Gray would have topped the Orioles rotation in either ERA or FIP in either of the last two seasons.    The problem with Gray is this season. After 16 games, Gray has a 5.16 ERA. There\xe2\x80\x99s always the chance this will open the door to buy low on a guy who could go back to being successful very easily - and provide a team with three full years of starts beyond this one. You\xe2\x80\x99d have to be nervous about swinging a big trade for a guy with a 5+ ERA and a WHIP of 1.467 to date. The Orioles and fixing broken starting pitchers aren\xe2\x80\x99t concepts that tend to go together. Although they took a look at him, the pedigree of the last couple of seasons is probably going to put Gray out of their price range as far as what they have to offer. Ervin Santana My basic rule for this trade deadline is that the Orioles won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get anyone you would actually want to have on the team. Santana is just bad enough that the Orioles might be able to get him. You probably don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have him on the team.    If scouts were looking to be impressed by Santana\xe2\x80\x99s start yesterday, they might have been swayed by his pitching a complete game shutout. On the other hand, who cares about one start against the Athletics? They are 15th in the AL in on-base percentage and 14th in slugging percentage. Their team is bad and their offense is a big reason why. For the season as a whole, Santana has a 4.06 ERA in 16 starts. That\xe2\x80\x99s in line with a 4.09 FIP. He\xe2\x80\x99s averaging a bit more than 5.2 innings per games started. It\xe2\x80\x99s also similar to the results Santana posted last season before getting suspended 80 games for testing positive for Stanozolol, a no-no in baseball\xe2\x80\x99s drug testing regime. That\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of baggage to be carrying around. Of course, the Orioles had some success in bringing on Nelson Cruz, suspended as a result of the Biogenesis investigation, but that was a lot more of a bargain than Santana might be. He\xe2\x80\x99s owed $13.5 million this season and each of the next two seasons and he\xe2\x80\x99s already 33 years old. Santana has also been heavily homer-prone in his career. Even a successful 2013 campaign in Kansas City still saw him give up 26 home runs, 18 of which he gave up in what\xe2\x80\x99s generally seen as a pitcher-friendly home park. Bringing those tendencies regularly to Oriole Park at Camden Yards seems like a bad idea. The numbers are not overwhelming. On the other hand, unlike some other pitchers we might name, Santana has held his velocity into his 30s - the 92.5mph he averages this year is in line with most of the numbers of his early career when he was in Anaheim. The risk of him getting here and turning into a pumpkin seems to be lower.    Of course, if it turns out he\xe2\x80\x99s actually not that bad, some team with real prospects and a need in their rotation might swoop in and get him instead. So even if you can talk yourself into Santana being alright, don\xe2\x80\x99t get your hopes up.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles reliever Brad Brach is among the most unlikely All ...', "" As All-Stars go, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get much more unlikely than Orioles reliever Brad Brach.    For the most part, pitchers don\xe2\x80\x99t get named to the team unless they are very good starting pitchers or very good closers. Not only is Brach not a closer, but when the season began, he was not even really a primary set-up man, slotting in for mostly seventh inning duty with Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day being the eighth inning guy. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like Brach is playing on a team where he was the token selection. The Orioles, with four other All-Stars, including Manny Machado in the starting lineup, were not exactly hurting for players being named to the squad for the Midsummer Classic. For the last month, since O\xe2\x80\x99Day landed on the disabled list with a hamstring strain, Brach has been the guy ahead of Zach Britton. He has pitched so well that he simply could not be ignored when Royals manager Ned Yost was picking pitchers for the AL team.    Even in today\xe2\x80\x99s game, with more importance than ever placed on the team\xe2\x80\x99s two or three best guys at the back end of the bullpen, what Brach has done so far is absurd. A sub-1.00 ERA is just ridiculous, yet Brach, after 1.2 scoreless innings on Wednesday, has lowered that number to 0.95. This is crazy.    Brach\xe2\x80\x99s WHIP is possibly even more gaudy than his ERA. He\xe2\x80\x99s now thrown 47.1 innings on the season over 38 games, giving him value as an occasional multi-inning reliever in a way that very few of his peers can match. Over those innings, Brach has only allowed 24 hits and 14 walks. That adds up to a WHIP of 0.803. Oh yeah, and he\xe2\x80\x99s struck out 56 batters. No wonder he\xe2\x80\x99s got such a low ERA. When you have an arsenal with that kind of command and strikeout potential, there just aren\xe2\x80\x99t many opportunities to get on base. It\xe2\x80\x99s impressive, so much so that he forced his way onto the All-Star team despite not being a closer.    So unlikely that not everyone likes it Not that everyone in the baseball media world is a fan of the decision to have Brach on the team. ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Keith Law - as if it could have been anyone else - picked Brach as one of his five All-Star selections who do NOT belong on the All-Star team, writing: What the hell is Brad Brach doing on an All-Star roster? He was replacement-level until last year and barely better than that in 2015, and he has a fluke performance of 1.01 ERA in 44 innings this year ... Brach is emblematic of the worst tendencies of the All-Star decision-making process with both the emphasis on current-year performance and the overrating of middle relievers. ... This spot should have gone to (White Sox starter Jose) Quintana, to pick just one of a few dozen more deserving players. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going on there. It\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to accept that some starting pitchers might have been more deserving All-Stars. Quintana would have been a fine All-Star. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why he\xe2\x80\x99s not on the team. One curiosity of the AL roster compared to the NL one is that it is so reliever-heavy. There are nine starting pitchers on the NL roster, with only five on the AL roster.     Are there really a \xe2\x80\x9cfew dozen more\xe2\x80\x9d players who should be on there than Brach, though? This is a bit tougher to accept, especially with Law painting Brach\xe2\x80\x99s performance as \xe2\x80\x9ca fluke\xe2\x80\x9d and labeling his 2015 as \xe2\x80\x9cbarely better than\xe2\x80\x9d replacement level. Brach\xe2\x80\x99s first half could be a fluke, of course. Orioles fans don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Neither does Law, who, on Twitter, cited Pat Neshek\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 as his precedent - 0.70 ERA before the All-Star game, 3.74 ERA afterwards. And depending on which WAR you consult, Brach was worth either 0.9 or 2.0 last year, not exactly \xe2\x80\x9cbarely better\xe2\x80\x9d than replacement. This year already, Brach\xe2\x80\x99s worth either 1.1 or 2.5 WAR to date. By the way, Neshek ended that 2014 season with a 1.87 ERA. That is an elite level for a reliever, even if he was much better in the first half. At the start of his column, Law states his overriding philosophy about All-Star selections: \xe2\x80\x9cIt's a marketing event for baseball -- not a popularity contest and not a way to reward first-half flukes.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s not kidding about his belief in the All-Star Game as a marketing event. Despite what he says above about Brach regarding current-year performance and overrating middle relievers, later in the column, Law takes issue with the inclusion of Marlins closer A.J. Ramos and suggests an alternative.    The alternative he offers Cardinals reliever Seung-hwan Oh - a Korean player in his MLB rookie season, who is also not a closer, and in fact is about as much of a middle reliever as is Brach. Oh\xe2\x80\x99s having a great season too, if not as great as Brach\xe2\x80\x99s to date. The most unlikely All-Star Brach on the All-Star roster is probably not bringing many viewers to the table, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. Maybe the cheering section from back in Freehold, NJ will be tuning in and that\xe2\x80\x99s about it. Yet all of those people out there who want to knock against Brach making the team because he\xe2\x80\x99s not one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s marketable names miss what makes him such a great and unlikely All-Star. Brach\xe2\x80\x99s career trajectory was not exactly traditional. He was drafted in the 42nd round of the 2008 draft. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t even a 42nd round in the draft any more. That\xe2\x80\x99s how far down there Brach was. He was a 22-year-old reliever when he was drafted. He never even went through the illusion of trying to be a starting pitcher in the professional ranks. Yet Brach kept on pitching, old for every level he ever appeared in, starting with Rookie league up until, finally, when he had earned his way to Triple-A Tucson in the Padres organization, he was at last younger than the average player at the level.     Even so, Brach was 25 years old by then, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly stick in the big leagues for good right away. Two years down the road, he was just another guy who could be optioned to the minors, and after a 2013 campaign in which Brach posted a respectable enough 3.19 ERA that masked an unsightly 1.774 WHIP. That\xe2\x80\x99s bad. No wonder they were willing to trade him to the Orioles for a Double-A pitcher, Devin Jones, who pitched in all of nine games in the Padres system. Jones had a 7.23 ERA in those games. As much as people bash Dan Duquette trades, he pulled off a good one here. Brach deserves credit too. He worked every step of the way to get to the big leagues and it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that he\xe2\x80\x99s kept working hard since coming to Baltimore. Brach has been better every year he\xe2\x80\x99s been here, and last year he was even improving as the season went along. Is it a fluke? Who cares? That\xe2\x80\x99s missing the point. Of course Brach\xe2\x80\x99s probably not going to have a sub-1.00 ERA at season\xe2\x80\x99s end. No one is that good. Not even 13-time All-Star Mariano Rivera ever pulled that one off. Even if this is the three month ride of his life and Brach is never this good again - though I hope he is - his All-Star selection is still a win for all of the grinders out there. The All-Star Game, and the game of baseball in general, is the richer for having guys like Brach be recognized in its exhibition full of stars. To be sure, Brach is not one of the young guns - he\xe2\x80\x99s 30 - and he\xe2\x80\x99s not one of the superstars.     Yet if you look down in the minor leagues, there are not many players who can honestly look in the mirror and tell themselves, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to be the next Mike Trout.\xe2\x80\x9d If they work hard, though, and if things go just right, there are more than a few hard workers who could be the next Brad Brach. Brach making the All-Star team, as much of an unlikely All-Star as he may be, is something that should be celebrated rather than panned. He might not even pitch, and in fact, O\xe2\x80\x99s fans might rather he get a few days rest, but that former 42nd round pick gets to be an All-Star and that\xe2\x80\x99s as cool as it gets.

07/08/2016,"[('Orioles Notebook: trading a postion player and minor ...', ' Trading a position player... There has lots of talk around the internet about trading a major league position player for some starting pitching reinforcements. The Orioles rotation has been bad, very bad, outside of Chris Tillman no one has an ERA under four in the starting rotation. If you take away Kevin Gausman and Tillman no one has an ERA under 5.67 except for Vance Worley who only made one start.     This is bad. The Orioles need only competence from their starting rotation and thus far it has been the three stooges manning the back of the rotation. Even in first place by 2.5 games and 14 games above .500 everyone can see, including the Orioles front office, that this level of poor performance will cost the team eventually.  With trades of recent vintage the Orioles minor league depth has been pilfered and the minor league depth on hand has been found wanting. One way to improve the pitching staff would be to improve the outfield defense which continues to be dreadful. However, some of the worst Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 defenders are also some of their better hitters and baseball does not allow three designated hitters.  The other way to improve the rotation would be through a trade, however as I talked about before the Orioles minor league depth is sparse. Other teams are in the hunt for quality starting pitching as well and teams like the Red Sox and Rangers have much better minor league systems to deal from.     So, as the thinking goes, take a little from the everyday lineup and put it towards fixing the rotation. The offense is great so removing one player from it won\xe2\x80\x99t cost the Orioles much and another quality pitcher will fix what ails the rotation. Again, as the thinking goes.     I think that is poor thinking. You should not \xe2\x80\x9crob Peter to pay Paul.\xe2\x80\x9d There is a good amount of evidence that having good hitters throughout the lineup creates a stacking effect leading to higher run scoring than expected. You can read here and here about how adding good hitters to good lineups leads to more run scoring.  The basic rundown is that since hitters preform better with men on base the same player inserted into a weaker lineup would not produce the same amount of overall run scoring for the team. Therefore, having strength up and down the lineup is what gives the Orioles offense an advantage and what propels them to be one of the best offenses in the leagues.     So, trading Mark Trumbo or Jonathan Schoop for pitching help weakens the offense to a greater degree than one pitcher will help the weak rotation. However, having said all of that there is one position player that makes some sense to trade and that is J.J. Hardy. He is under contract through next year for $14 million and has a $14 million option in 2018 with a $2 million buyout.  That is a pretty team friendly contract and gives whomever is trading for him more than a rental which opens up the market to teams that are looking for shortstop help and looking to compete next year. I cannot think of many teams off the top of my head that fit this category, but J.J. Hardy is a valuable player still and for the right team makes some sense.     For the Orioles it makes sense for a couple of reasons. One, the replacement shortstop is already on the roster. Manny Machado filled in for Hardy exceptionally well while Hardy was on the DL. Two, Ryan Flaherty could move to 3B.  Hardy has not been a good hitter in 1.5 years so if he is moved the Orioles everyday lineup has the same number of weak hitters as before (really just the one). Therefore, the offense is not hurt much at all either.  Hardy may not have the highest trade value and I\xe2\x80\x99m not really advocating trading him away. However, if people are going to talk about trading away a position player, his name makes a lot more sense than some others.  Developing Relievers  Developing major league relievers can be hard. Getting into games not all that often and only facing a couple of hitters at a time can make it difficult for pitchers to learn how to get hitters out. That is why many relievers in the major leagues are failed minor league starters. However, combing through the minor league box scores I noticed something interesting the the Orioles have been doing with their minor league relievers.   Jon Keller, 20 Games, 29.2 IP Ashur Tolliver, 25 Games, 34.2 IP Tanner Scott, 25 Games, 43.1 IP Garrett Cleavinger, 20 Games, 48.1 IP Jay Flaa, 17 Games, 29.1 IP Christian Turnipseed, 24 Games, 33.0 IP  None of these pitchers are starters or have started a game for an Orioles minor league team, but they all have more innings pitched than games appeared in and some by quite a large margin. Think of Brad Brach or Mychal Givens on the current roster who often go above and beyond one inning pitched giving Buck Showalter a lot more bullpen flexibility.     The Orioles seem to be attempting the same thing with their minor league relievers. Let them pitch to left and right handed batters, maybe work through a lineup. There are probably even more guys then I picked up on, but these were the ones I found through a cursory glance. Maybe the Orioles have a pitching development plan after all.   ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles lose to Angels, 9-5; Ubaldo Jimenez again falls ...', ' There have been better Friday nights in the history of Baltimore baseball ... much better nights. The Angels were the better team from the first pitch in this series opener. For Ubaldo Jimenez, he falls to 5-9 after this very disappointing outing.    The recap It\xe2\x80\x99s never a good thing when the bullpen begins stirring in the top of the first inning. On this particular night, Ubaldo Jimenez was the culprit of quite a few early, ugly stares from the Camden Yards faithful.  In the top of the first, Jimenez allowed a walk-single-single-wild pitch sequence, surrendering RBI to Albert Pujols (single) and C.J. Cron (groundout) before he could record a pair of outs. The Angels led 2-0 after the first half inning of play, not enough however to discourage the threat of the Birds offense. Adam Jones blasted a solo home run on the first pitch he saw from LAA starter Matt Shoemaker, drilling the first O\xe2\x80\x99s run of the game deep into center field. The mammoth dinger was Jones\xe2\x80\x99 17th of 2016.      Home run, Adam Jones. And just like that, the #Orioles trail 2-1. pic.twitter.com/Is5174TWkA\xe2\x80\x94 Jon Meoli (@JonMeoli) July 8, 2016    After Jimenez consistently missed the zone to begin the second inning of play, the MASN cameras again shifted to the \xe2\x80\x98pen to show Mike Wright rapidly loosening up. And as the script has followed throughout much of the season, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long before Jimenez would need the help.    With runners on first and third, Yunel Escobar grounded a hard single up the middle to boost the Angels lead to 3-1. The next batter, Kole Calhoun, roped another hard-hit shot to right field to make the score 4-1, effectively ending the night for Jimenez.  Wright would get the call from the skipper after the early mess - he stranded Calhoun at first, but Mike Trout managed a sacrifice fly on the first pitch Wright threw to increase the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s lead to 5-1.     Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s final line: 1.1 IP, 5 hits, 5 earned runs, 2 walks, 0 strikeouts Wright did technically enter the game to save Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s poor outing, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite go as planned. Two hit-by-pitches, a walk and two productive Angels outs led to two runs in the top of the fourth, making it 8-1 and, obviously, putting things out of reach.  Jonathan Schoop crushed a deep, deep blast to left in the bottom of the fourth to double the O\xe2\x80\x99s score, but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop the Angels from scoring. They kept pressing Wright, tacking on plenty of baserunners and another run in the sixth to again bump their lead to seven.    With the score at 9-2 in the bottom of the sixth, things got just interesting enough to give the full Camden Yards crowd a sliver a hope before it was abruptly swiped away.  After Shoemaker allowed a single to Manny Machado and walked Chris Davis, Mark Trumbo looped an RBI single to left to score #13. That made it 9-3, as Mike Scioscia went to his bullpen, calling upon fastball-heavy righty Cam Bedrosian. With runners at first and second with one out, Jonathan Schoop was hit in the helmet by a 94 MPH fastball (he walked to first and was cleared by Richie Bancells) to load the bases for eight-hole hitter Pedro Alvarez. He struck out, leaving J.J. Hardy to either severely dent the Angels lead, or to send fans briskly walking to the parking lot.  Unfortunately, the latter became the reality. He fanned on a check swing, ending the inning and effectively forcing three final innings of - for lack of a better term - garbage time. On the bright side, Chaz Roe entered in the seventh and worked two fantastic innings of baseball, while Odrisamer Despaigne did the same in the ninth. The offense couldn\xe2\x80\x99t claw their way back into the win column, but perhaps positive Roe and Despaigne news is the perfect ending to this very imperfect game.     Now at 49-36, the Orioles will finish up this home series against the Angels and potentially capture their 50th win before taking what appears to be a much-needed All-Star hiatus.  Other notables  Mark Trumbo crushed a line-drive HR to left in the ninth inning to boost his season total to 27. Watching him in the Home Run Derby on Monday is going to be a treat. J.J. Hardy had a pair of errors on the night, two ground balls. Perhaps getting them out of the way in games like these isn\xe2\x80\x99t the worst thing in the world.

Los Angeles Angels defeated Baltimore Orioles 9-5. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles, despite their overall good record, have allowed too many early runs in games.This is of course symptomatic of a very troubled rotation. And even the better pitchers on the Orioles have a tendency to yield too many first-innings runs (i.e. Chris Tillman).Falling behind early in games puts a great deal of pressure on the offense, though fortunately the Orioles have a lineup that can and does come back. That the Orioles rank among the best couple of teams in the game in come-from-behind wins is not only a statement about the powerful lineup, it also is the product of deficits due to poor starting pitching.The problem appeared again last night, predictably with Ubaldo Jimenez starting. On a night honoring the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first World Series Championship team of 50 years ago, it was not a good sign that UJ, in only 1.1 innings of pitching, gave up 2.5 times more runs than the entire pitching staff did in the 1966 Series.This simply has to be the end of the road for Jimenez. The word from the beat writers covering the Orioles is that they are willing to eat the money and let him go. It is time. Heck, it is well past time! In baseball equivalency, we are in about the 15th or 16th inning of patience.Even so, Mike Wright was not categorically better. Scioscia is an attitudinal pain in the derriere to watch hanging over the dugout railing with his chin on folded arms. But can you blame him for being irritated by watching the same pitcher ding three of his guys, including breaking the hand of one of them?At the end of the night, the Orioles went down to defeat 9-5. They did hit three home runs and were only set down in order in one of the nine innings. But the Birds failed to capitalize on opportunities, going 1-for-8 with runners in scoring positions. And you know you\xe2\x80\x99re not destined to win when J.J. Hardy makes errors on back-to-back plays.For the season, the first innings numbers for Baltimore are really quite dreadful. The staff has given up a total of 62 runs, which is equal to 6.56 per nine innings. The O\xe2\x80\x99s offense has scored 46 first inning runs. The only other inning that comes close to these numbers for Baltimore pitching is the sixth, actually worse at a 6.88 per nine innings rate. Of course we have seen this be a difficult transition inning when starters are struggling to truly get deep into the game.If you think it was a rough night for the Birds, the Bowie Baysox had it worse. They dropped a game to the Reading Phillies by a final score of 21-4, giving up all of those runs in the first five innings. Just trying to be like the Big Club, I guess. The Reading team has a record of 62-26, possibly still the best in all levels of baseball. Matthew Grimes \xe2\x80\x93 Carolina League all-star with a 1.69 ERA on the season \xe2\x80\x93 makes his second AA start tonight and will look to cool off the Phillies.Is there any good news anywhere in Orioleland? Actually yes. The Delmarva Shorebirds won last night 5-0 on a no-hitter pitched by Ofelky Peralta. It was rain-shortened to five innings, but it still counts!\xc2\xa0 Peralta is a 19-year-old from the Dominican Republic in his third year and is currently 5-4 with a 3.45 ERA. He gave up only one hit in six innings in his previous start, both of these games being against the first-half champion Hagerstown Suns.

07/11/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: A Solid First Half of 2016', 'The Baltimore Orioles finished the first half of the 2016 season with a solid 4-2 win over the Angels, securing first place at the break.But even with a 51-36 record and American League East lead of two games over the Blue Jays and Red Sox, Orioles fans have an ongoing sense of hanging by a thread. It is the terribly unreliable starting rotation that feeds this feeling, even as the O\xe2\x80\x99s have proven there is more than one way to winning baseball games.Much about the Sunday game was a microcosm of the first half. Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s start will look a lot better on paper than it did in person (and I was at the game on this occasion). Though he held the damage to only a single run in the first inning, there were five walks and a lot of hard-hit balls and deep flyouts. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t always pretty, but somehow the job gets done and the victories outnumber the losses.The Orioles scored three of their four runs on home runs, another prominent trend of the 2016 season. Chris Davis brought the O\xe2\x80\x99s back from an early 1-0 deficit with an opposite field home run, while J.J. Hardy gave them a valuable insurance run in the eighth inning with a screaming liner to left field.\xc2\xa0 He also had a previous clutch RBI hit for the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 third run. Hitting out of the ninth hole is, in my estimation, the place for Hardy in the lineup. There he can so some serious damage in driving in runs while also turning over the batting order.Fellow All-Star relievers Brad Brach and Zach Britton did their final two-inning, one-two punch. But they had some balls squared up on them a bit and have not seemed as dominating in recent outings. Showalter said of Tillman that he was glad the pitcher was not going to the All-Star game. I would wish that for all the O\xe2\x80\x99s players. Other than helping to gain a possible World Series home field advantage, there is little to gain and a lot to lose. The break would do them much good. And Mark Trumbo will be swinging for the fences, while we hope this does not mess up his swing as it had with others in the past.

The Birds trailed until the fourth inning, in which\xc2\xa0Chris Davis sent a deep shot the opposite way into the left field grandstand for a two-run homer.

07/12/2016,"[('American League wins World Series home field for Orioles ...', ' As it ended up, the most noteworthy thing about the 2016 All-Star Game for Orioles fans is that Major League Baseball screwed Baltimore out of getting to host this year\xe2\x80\x99s edition of the game as punishment for carrying on the fight in the MASN case.    If that\xe2\x80\x99s a new story to you, check out this article from Baseball Prospectus last year which makes the strong suggestion that the Orioles were all lined up to host this year\xe2\x80\x99s game until suddenly they weren\xe2\x80\x99t. The belief that the MASN fight and the Orioles not hosting are connected was stated directly by a couple of people around baseball during tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game. The next most noteworthy thing is that the American League won the contest, 4-2, with Zach Britton picking up the save, so if the Orioles do somehow make it to the World Series, that means that the first two games and games 6 and 7 would be hosted in Baltimore. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of baseball between now and then. Other than that, there really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much to talk about. The three Orioles batters, Manny Machado, Matt Wieters, and Mark Trumbo, combined to go 0-6, with only Trumbo reaching base at all, and that only because of a fielding error. Machado only saw six pitches in three at-bats.    There was one amusing play in the field for Machado. In the fifth inning, Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s Nolan Arenado hit a lazy ground ball towards shortstop with a runner already on first base. Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts, who is a poor man\xe2\x80\x99s Machado, stood his ground and waited for the ball to roll to him.    Machado did not feel like waiting around for the ball, so he cut over from his third base position to get in front of the ball, field it, and flip to second base to get the lead runner. Bogaerts, waiting on the ball, could have probably only gotten an out at first. This may have saved a run for the AL squad as the next batter, Wil Myers, hit a double that was not able to score Arenado from first, even with two outs.    Britton\xe2\x80\x99s ninth inning saw him record three outs on three ground balls, which is what he tends to do in regular games too. One of them snuck through the infield. Another was a comebacker to Britton that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t field quickly enough to turn a double play. The third was a game-ending double play. The fifth Orioles All-Star, Brad Brach, did not get into the game, although he did at least get up and warm when Blue Jays starter Aaron Sanchez ran into a little bit of trouble in the fourth inning. As for the rest of the game, all four American League runs were driven in by two Royals players, Eric Hosmer and Salvador Perez. Each one homered in the second inning. Hosmer also had an RBI single in the third inning. He was named MVP of the game.    There will now be two days with no baseball. We will make it through this somehow. The good news is that the Orioles will be in first place the whole time.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""Baltimore Orioles' Mark Trumbo bows out in the semis"", 'Mark Trumbo of the Baltimore Orioles was the top seed in the 2016 Home Run Derby at the MLB All-Star game, but bowed out in the semi-finals.Mark Trumbo of the Baltimore Orioles knew that the competition was going to be stiff in the 2016 Home Run Derby at the MLB All-Star game. Heck, with Miami\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Giancarlo Stanton in the competition (the eventual champion) it was almost a race for second place if anything. Trumbo bowed out to Stanton in the semi-finals, but he certainly ended up with a strong showing.Trumbo was the only participant to hit the scoreboard at Petco Park. He also hit a couple of balls onto rooftops in the stadium complex. It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to note that the Orioles were just in San Diego two weeks ago at the beginning of their west coast trip. So maybe that helped Trumbo to get familiar with the confines.As I said above, you knew that the competition would be stiff with Stanton in the sweepstakes. I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of the one year at the NBA All-Star game when Larry Bird walked into the locker room before the three-point contest and wondered aloud who would be placing second. Obviously the implication was that Bird (who incidentally is my favorite NBA player of all time) would be placing first \xe2\x80\x93 which he did. Stanton didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything along those lines, however everyone knows the type of hitter he is.\xc2\xa0Live Feed mark trumboBaltimore Orioles: While slumping, a drop in the lineup may be beneficial for Trumbo The Baltimore WireIs Major League Baseball in need of a face?

Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s longest home run of the competition was in the first round, and it traveled 479 feet. Not too shabby if you think about it.Obviously the only concern from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint is that somehow participating in this messes with Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s swing in some manner. While it\xe2\x80\x99s rare for a slugger to totally fall off the map in the second half, sometimes that can in fact happen. My personal opinion is that the whole concept of potential injury or messed up mechanics as a result of particiating in all-star festivities is overblown.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

But rather than looking at the standings, it may be more instructive to compare each team with its expectations before the season began.Bovada, like many oddsmakers, posted an over/under total for each team in March, a guess on how many games each team would win. Oddsmakers usually know what they are talking about. The three teams expected to slip the most this year \xe2\x80\x94 the Cardinals, the Pirates and the Royals \xe2\x80\x94 are all running well behind their winning percentages from last season. Three teams expected to improve significantly \xe2\x80\x94 the Red Sox, the Marlins and the Tigers \xe2\x80\x94 have all done so.Therefore, it seems perfectly fair to judge teams on a curve of sorts. It matters less if you are good or bad, and more on whether you are an overachiever or an underachiever.First, the top grades.3. Texas Rangers, 54-36, projects to 97 wins. Over/under: 84.5.Texas was a solid 88-74 last season and made the playoffs. But the Astros were the popular pick to win the American League West this season, in part because Texas lost starter Yovani Gallardo to the Orioles in free agency. Instead, the Rangers have raced to the best record in the league and a five-and-a-half-game division lead. Cole Hamels is 9-2, and Ian Desmond is hitting .322 with 15 homers. While no one has most valuable player numbers, almost no key player is not pulling his weight. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      One concern is that the Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 run differential is only third in the division, trailing the Mariners and the Astros, a sign that some above-average luck has helped the team so far.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  2. San Francisco Giants, 57-33, projects to 103 wins. Over/under: 89.5.The Giants were 84-78 last year and fell eight games short of the playoffs. Improvement was expected this season from those who were entranced by the one-two pitching punch of Madison Bumgarner and Johnny Cueto, the nine-figure free-agent signing . They were right. Bumgarner is 10-4 and Cueto 13-1, and the Giants have the best record in baseball.1. Baltimore Orioles, 51-36, projects to 95 wins. Over/under: 79.5.Although the Orioles are not having as great a season as the Giants, the curve thrusts them to the top of the table. While the Giants were expected to be a solid winning team, Baltimore was expected to be thoroughly mediocre. Last year the Orioles were 81-81, and their pitching staff for this season was seen as particularly thin. The tough A.L. East was also seen as a hurdle.But behind Chris Tillman (12-2) and Mark Trumbo (a startling major-league-leading 28 home runs), the Orioles are leading the A.L. East.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Before you buy playoff tickets, consider that like the Rangers, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 run differential is weak, third in the division behind the highly fancied Blue Jays and the Red Sox, who are each only two games back.

Their manager, Fredi Gonzalez, was the first one fired this season, with the team\xe2\x80\x99s record at 9-28. But the Braves are a more respectable 22-30 since. And a bad Braves team was expected anyway: Their over/under was 66.5, the worst of any team but the Phillies (65.5). So while their projection of 56 wins is bad, the team is not underachieving badly enough to make the top three.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Another team you might expect to see here is Kansas City, which has fallen from a World Series title to barely above .500. But oddsmakers have never liked the Royals very much, and gave them an over/under of only 85.5. The Cardinals, who had the best record in baseball at 100-62 last season, are only 46-42. But oddsmakers correctly guessed they would fall off, giving them an over/under of only 87.5 because of the losses of John Lackey and Jason Heyward to the rival Cubs in free agency.3. Arizona Diamondbacks, 38-52, projects to 68 wins. Over/under 82.5.Take a team just below .500 and add Zack Greinke, and you should get a winning team, right? What if Paul Goldschmidt continues to kill the ball and Jake Lamb has a breakthrough season? Despite these good things, Arizona is a mess. Greinke started well, but is now on the disabled list, and no other regular starter has a winning record; despite a 7.14 E.R.A., Shelby Miller has been given 14 starts. Reports are swirling that the Diamondbacks are going to give up on the season and trade Greinke.2. Los Angeles Angels, 37-52, projects to 67 wins. Over/under 81.5.After an 85-77 season last year, last place in the A.L. West looks pretty bad. Mike Trout is hitting great, as usual, but receiving little support, and the pitching has been shaky. Injuries have hit hard, too.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  1. Minnesota Twins, 32-56, projects to 59 wins. Over/under 78.5.The Twins\xe2\x80\x99 offense has been about average, but the pitching has been bad, giving up the most runs in the American League. Ervin Santana (3-7. 4.06) is the best starter; the rest are all on the wrong side of a 5.00 E.R.A.  Last year at this time, the Twins were flying high.

Ubaldo Jimenez went 5-9 with a 7.38 ERA, Kevin Gausman was 1-6 and Yovani Gallardo has yet to reach a groove after spending nearly two months on the disabled list. Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson were shuffled back and forth from the minors, doing little to warrant an extended stay in Baltimore.""I think I can speak on behalf of all of us \xe2\x80\x94 we can definitely do better,"" Gausman said.If the Orioles are to complete their run to the AL East title and flourish in the postseason, they can either fix the problem or hope to win in spite of it.""It\'s worked out so far,"" said Chris Davis, whose 22 homers ranks second on the team behind Mark Trumbo\'s major-league best 28. ""Obviously at some point you have to start pitching a little bit better out of the starting rotation, but for the most part we\'ve been able to pick them up with our bats.""The Orioles have power and an air-tight infield. Britton has converted every one of his 27 save opportunities. But that one missing element could upend Baltimore\'s bid to outlast Boston and Toronto in the talent-laden division.""Obviously, the biggest thing for us going forward is pitching,"" Britton said. ""Very rarely do teams get through the postseason just on hitting. We\'re going to have to find a way to pitch a little bit better.""Or, executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette can hunt down another viable starter before the non-waiver trade deadline.Two years ago, Duquette shored up the bullpen by getting standout reliever Andrew Miller, proving that if a deal needs to be made he won\'t hesitate to swap potential big leaguers for immediate help.""They know what we need and we know what we need. It\'s just a matter of getting it done,"" Orioles third baseman Manny Machado said. ""I\'ve got faith in the front office. If we need somebody, they\'re going to go out and get them.""Manager Buck Showalter is willing to move forward without outside assistance.""Help is right here this group. We are not coveting other people\'s players,"" Showalter insisted. ""Every answer we need to have is in here.""Baltimore went 51-36 before the break, so maybe Showalter has a point.""The bottom line to this whole thing is to score one more run than the other team, even if it\'s 7-6,"" Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ""Where you might look at their rotation and see guys who may be struggling a little bit, they\'re always in a game because of their ability to hit the ball out of the park. And when they do get a lead, they\'ve got a pen that is even deeper than just the two guys on the back end.""The bullpen lacks a proven left-hander, but the relief corps should improve later this month when setup man Darren O\'Day gets off the disabled list following a right hamstring strain.If Trumbo, Davis, Machado and catcher Matt Wieters continue to whack the ball, the efficiency of the pitching staff might not matter.Not many teams win this way, but the Orioles don\'t want to hear it.""Our guys don\'t dwell on conventionality. We don\'t always follow a script,"" Showalter said. ""Starters have to go seven innings every night? Who says you do?Baltimore opens the second half Friday night in Tampa Bay before heading to New York for four games against the Yankees. The Orioles were 33-14 at home and 18-22 on the road before the break.""It\'s obvious what\'s ahead of us,"" Showalter said.

New York Supreme Court Justice Lawrence K. Marks in November threw out an arbitration decision that said the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network, which is controlled by the Orioles, owes the Nationals about $298 million for the team\xe2\x80\x99s 2012-16 television rights. MASN was established in March 2005 after the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington and became the Nationals, moving into what had been Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive broadcast territory since 1972. The Orioles were given a supermajority partnership interest in MASN, and when the parties could not agree on a rights fee for 2012-16, they appeared in April 2012 before baseball\xe2\x80\x99s three-man Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee, as required in the MASN agreement. Marks tossed aside the RSCD\xe2\x80\x99s decision, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the sides what to do next.

At this point after 38 games and going 27-for-27 in save opportunities, Britton has an amazing ERA of 0.72 in 37.2 innings. His WHIP stands at 0.823. All of this explains why he was the last guy on the mound at the end of the All-Star Game.Over the past three years, Britton is 9-4 with a 1.55 ERA and WHIP of 0.918 \xe2\x80\xa6 all of this over a total of 180 innings. Add to this 184 strikeouts. Simply fantastic numbers!But how do these statistics compare with the very best relievers in the past couple of years? Or, beyond that, how does it compare to the ultimate closer \xe2\x80\x93 Mariano Rivera?To make this comparison work, let us start with projecting Britton\xe2\x80\x99s numbers over the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first 87 games into a full 162-game season. This will bring him to a total of 70 innings pitched with 50 saves. In the chart below, he is on the top line (Brit 16).The top saves leader in the National League just last year was Mark Melancon (Mel 15) of the Pirates. He totaled 50 saves, which is equal to Britton\xe2\x80\x99s projections. But note the higher ERA of 2.23 and fewer strikeouts.Next let us compare to the fantastic seasons of 2013 and 2014 for Greg Holland of the Royals (GH 13, GH 14). The ERA is a bit higher than Britton\xe2\x80\x99s projections, along with the WHIP just slightly more, but the greater number of strikeouts for similar innings is remarkable.Greg Kimbrell had a number of recent outstanding seasons for the Atlanta Braves, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll look at two of them from 2012 and 2013 (GK 12, GK 13). The strikeouts per innings pitched are even better than the numbers for Holland, and all the other stats are in a similar range as Britton\xe2\x80\x99s projection.The greatest of them all is Mariano Rivera. The 13-time All-Star pitched in 19 seasons and registered a total of 652 career saves. Standing out among his statistics is the incredible consistency for year after year. For comparison\xe2\x80\x99s sake, I selected the year he had his highest number of saves (MR 04) and the season where he had his lowest total earned run average (MR 08). His strikeout numbers are not really higher than Britton\xe2\x80\x99s, though the ERA is higher than what Zach would have if he can maintain the 0.72 number over the whole season.Putting all of this on a graph \xe2\x80\xa6Name/YrERAIPSVWHIPSOBrit 160.7270500.82380Mel 152.2378510.98262GH 131.2167470.866103GH 141.4462.1460.91490CK 121.0162.2420.654116CK 131.2167500.88198MR 041.9478.2531.08166MR 081.4070.2390.66577\xc2\xa0Conclusion: Zach Britton is having a rare season of excellence, especially considering the very low ERA. It can be seen from the relatively modest strikeout numbers (relative to some of the other top relievers) that he induces more poor contact than that he simply blows batters away.

In a Wednesday column for ESPN, Jim Bowden wrote that Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s representation presented the Orioles with a long-term contract offer back in spring training. His source for this piece of information, he said, was Machado himself.    Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re now in the middle of July and nothing has come of that yet, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth getting too excited. Bowden notes that the team said it would get back to Machado\xe2\x80\x99s side and has not done so yet. He also said that Machado expressed that there is no hurry. It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting bit of news, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of meaningless unless it leads to something happening down the road. Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad sign that there was at least some initiative on the player end to try to have some contract talks.  Not that there\xe2\x80\x99s any indication of what the parameters that may have been proposed by Machado\xe2\x80\x99s agency. The knee jerk reaction is, \xe2\x80\x9cMachado\xe2\x80\x99s interested in staying here long-term? Back up the dump trucks full of money!\xe2\x80\x9d Follow down that path and a lack of action to date becomes frustrating, even though there might be a good reason for it.    Maybe Machado\xe2\x80\x99s side asked for something completely ridiculous like 15 years for $1 billion or something. No, that\xe2\x80\x99s an exaggeration, of course. Obviously, it also wasn\xe2\x80\x99t low enough that the Orioles would accept the offer immediately. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of room in between those two extremes.    If - and this is a big if - the Orioles waited because they wanted to see another consecutive full, successful season from Machado before committing, they\xe2\x80\x99ve likely cost themselves a lot of money. Machado is headed towards another potential top five finish in the MVP voting - maybe top three or higher. The price tag is not going to be reduced with how he\xe2\x80\x99s performed this season. Before moving on to other topics in the article, Bowden also points out that Machado\xe2\x80\x99s agents negotiated large deals for Joey Votto with the Reds and Albert Pujols with the Angels. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why the Pujols contract is being held up by Bowden as a good thing.     Maybe Bowden meant the contract Pujols had with the Cardinals that ended up being an eight year, $111 million deal. That was signed back in 2004 after Pujols began his MLB career with three straight top five MVP finishes. Votto, on the other hand, signed a three year, $38 million extension before his first year of arbitration in 2011. A year later, he added on another ten years and $225 million to the contract. In both of those cases, the player ended up signing at least some kind of multi-year contract before hitting their first year of arbitration. Machado, making $5 million this season, is already past that point. As he was 20 in his first full season, he is younger than either of those other guys was, which likely will, and should, adjust his contract demands upward.    The Orioles will have to pay up in some fashion to keep Machado. This past offseason\xe2\x80\x99s deal with Chris Davis offers some hope that they will do this, but Machado\xe2\x80\x99s going to make more than even Davis money, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll have more suitors to tempt him if he gets to be a free agent, too.  Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth something that Machado is interested enough in staying that his agents made an offer to the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Hopefully the two sides can get something done between now and the time Machado is a free agent.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
07/15/2016,"[('Orioles trade target: Jeremy Hellickson - Camden Chat', ' The second half of the season starts tomorrow, and somehow the O\xe2\x80\x99s are still in first place. They\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to do this despite having a starting rotation that has been catastrophically bad - Orioles starters have the 3rd worst ERA in baseball (5.15), the 2nd worst WHIP (1.48), and have thrown the fewest innings in the majors.    It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine the Birds continuing to stay atop the division if the rotation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get better, and there don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be any good young pitchers waiting in the wings to help make that happen. If the rotation is going to improve, it\xe2\x80\x99ll probably have to improve via trade.  It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too difficult to go out and pick up a starter if the Orioles had the Dodgers\xe2\x80\x99 or the Astros\xe2\x80\x99 farm system, but unfortunately the Orioles have the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 farm system. That would be an issue in any season, but it\xe2\x80\x99s especially problematic this year when good, available starters are few and far between. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get these out of the way: the O\xe2\x80\x99s aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to get Julio Teheran or Sonny Gray. The ship has sailed on Drew Pomeranz, and they were never going to get him anyway. Someone will pay a premium for Rich Hill - despite his track record and age, the guy has a 2.25 ERA. The two years and $27 million left on Ervin Santana\xe2\x80\x99s contract might be a problem for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, but won\xe2\x80\x99t be an issue for a contender with deeper pockets. Matt Moore might be traded, but probably not to a division rival. The list goes on and on.    Moving past the names above, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take long to get into a list of pitchers who frankly aren\xe2\x80\x99t very good. Do we really want the Orioles to give up anything of value for Hector Santiago\xe2\x80\x99s 4.58 ERA and 5.14 FIP, or a sub-replacement level Andrew Cashner? No, thanks.    One pitcher, though, seems like he could strike the perfect balance between being gettable and being actually worth acquiring. That pitcher is Jeremy Hellickson. Coming into the 2016 season, Hellickson was struggling. After two excellent 2011-12 seasons in Tampa where he posted ERAs of 2.95 and 3.10, Hellickson took a nosedive. He finished with ERAs of 5.17, 4.52, and 4.62 in 2013-15 respectively, and was picked up by Philly this year on a one-year deal.    The 29-year-old righty was getting similar results in 2016 until the past few weeks. Hellickson has allowed one run apiece in each of his last three starts, and he\xe2\x80\x99s lowered his season ERA to 3.92. After the last couple years it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to write this off as just a hot streak, but there\xe2\x80\x99s reason to think his performance is legit. Hellickson is striking out more batters (and walking less) than ever before, and his HR/FB and BABIP are right around where they were last year so it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if he\xe2\x80\x99s been getting lucky. In fact, if anything, there\xe2\x80\x99s reason to believe that three-year run from 2013-2015 was unlucky. Amazingly, his two worst seasons in terms of FIP and xFIP out of the last five were actually those two great years in 2011 and 2012. Since then, his peripherals have actually improved, with an xFIP hovering around 4.10 even though his ERAs have been considerably higher.    If Hellickson is moved, he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t command a huge price in the trade market because he\xe2\x80\x99s just a rental. Some teams might be concerned about his track record prior to this season. That\xe2\x80\x99s a real \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x9d, though, because the Phillies have a few reasons they might want to keep him. First of all, the way he\xe2\x80\x99s pitching he may be a candidate for a qualifying offer. If the Phillies feel that a first-round pick is more valuable than whatever they\xe2\x80\x99d be getting in a trade, it would make sense to hang onto him.  Philadelphia is also a team that has their eye on competing soon, as their prospects like J.P. Crawford graduate to the majors. Considering their payroll is about $60 million less than last season (how is that even possible?), they can afford to throw $17 million or so in Hellickson\xe2\x80\x99s direction. It won\xe2\x80\x99t cripple them if he takes it. If the Phillies really are trying to move Hellickson, the Orioles should go after him. They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get a top-of-the-market starter, and most other starters aren\xe2\x80\x99t worth acquiring. Jeremy Hellickson is one of the few guys who is not only obtainable but would also be a big improvement to the rotation.

Although Chris Tillman has been performing extremely well, leading all SP\xe2\x80\x99s with 12 Wins and a 3.41 ERA, everyone else has underperformed. Kevin Gausman  has yet to start pitching to his ability, although he has had his moments, and Yovani Gallardo  has been up, down, and injured.The Orioles need a strong starting pitcher. Dan Duquette has made it clear that the Orioles plan on making a strong push towards acquiring a starting pitcher but there\xe2\x80\x99s not much available on the market, especially since Drew Pomeranz was dealt to our rivals, the Boston Red Sox. So what options does that leave for the Orioles when there are still 14-15 teams vying for 2 or 3 available starters.There\xe2\x80\x99s the possibility that the Diamondbacks may be willing to deal Robbie Ray and there\xe2\x80\x99s been plenty of talks about the Phillies shopping Jeremy Hellickson. I feel both pitchers would fit well in the Orioles organization and they both have a lot of upside if Baltimore has the trade tips available to make an acquisition. The worst case scenario is sending Mark Trumbo away to gain an arm, the most likely case is bargaining Trey Mancini, Christian Walker and Chris Lee, who has had a strong start to 2016 with a 5-0 record and maintaining a 2.98 ERA in 51.1 Innings Pitched.

Baltimore Orioles defeated Los Angeles Angels 3-2. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles once again had a starter go only five innings but also once again were able to hang around and win the game on a home run.Yovani Gallardo, despite 58 pitches in the first two innings, held the Rays to only three runs. The Orioles would scratch and claw long enough to tie the game, eventually winning it on a Jonathan Schoop home run and the strength of the bullpen.Reliever Mychal Givens registered his seventh win of the season, doing so after only a total of 41.1 innings pitched. This breaks a two-way tie between he and fellow reliever Brad Brach for the second-most number of wins on the team behind the 12 of Chris Tillman.That last sentence is weird!

It was the 14th round-tripper of the season for the O\xe2\x80\x99s second baseman.Be it far from me to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI told you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But, I told you so \xe2\x80\xa6 that Schoop was going to have a breakout season. Quoting from our preseason article on Jonathan, we wrote \xe2\x80\xa6I am anticipating a big breakout season, believing that he is approaching the time where accumulated experience meets with rare skills at the peak age of life. He just needs to stay healthy and not have something like a blown-out knee happen on a take-out slide. I will go so far as to predict that, given a full and healthy year, Schoop will be at worst third on this team in total home runs.Actually he is fifth on the team in long balls, behind Trumbo (28), Davis (22), Jones (19) and Machado (17). But it ain\xe2\x80\x99t over yet.The better statistical improvement for Schoop is in the area of batting average and OBP. Getting his 100th hit of the season with the home run, he is now hitting .303 with a .337 OBP.In the preseason article referenced above, an extensive conversation was included about where Schoop ranked among second basemen, taking off on an article by FanGraphs that had this position for the Orioles as #22 in all of baseball. That is simply ludicrous! Even before this season began, that is crazy talk. That article spoke much about Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s lack of plate discipline, citing his 10-to-1 strikeout to walk ratio (which he has cut in half this year). And the article projected that Schoop would likely have a regressive year. So much for sabremetrics!Having also written here on The Baltimore Wire a few days ago that nothing especially good for the regular season comes out of All-Star Games for those who participate, I was worried that the sushi-induced food poisoning of Matt Wieters and Zach Britton would cause a second-half opening-game setback for the Birds. Fortunately they gutted their way through it (pun intended). And Trumbo had two hits after his silver medal home run derby placement. Brad Brach and Manny looked decent as well.

Schoop has hit safely in 10 consecutive games to raise his average to .303 and belted the go-ahead homer in Friday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-3 victory in the series opener against the Rays. Baltimore owns a two-game lead in the American League East after winning for the fifth time in six games and will send ace Chris Tillman to the mound on Saturday. Tillman will have to be careful with Tampa Bay\xe2\x80\x99s Evan Longoria, who is 17-for-47 with seven homers and 10 RBIs in his career against him. Left-hander Matt Moore goes for Tampa Bay, which has dropped 23 of its last 26 games and seven straight overall while going 2-8 against the Orioles in 2016.

The 28-year-old suffered through two rough starts to end June, including a no-decision against Tampa Bay when he permitted six runs on 10 hits in five frames. Tillman is 7-9 with a 4.23 ERA in 23 career outings against the Rays. Moore has given up two earned runs or fewer in five of his last six starts, going 3-2 during that stretch, but one of the losses was against the Orioles. The 27-year-old yielded five runs and seven hits over 6 2/3 innings in that outing and is 4-6 with a 4.13 ERA lifetime against the Orioles.

J.J. Hardy's two-run homer in the second inning was enough for the Orioles (53-36)  who have won six of seven. The Rays (34-56) are at the other extreme  having lost eight in a row  12 of 13 and 24 of 27 -- the last is the worst stretch by any American League team since 2003.

He bashed 95 homers for the Angels in his first three full seasons, but he also struck out a lot and had only a .299 on-base percentage.

The Mariners needed salary relief and cleared Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s $9.15 million. For Baltimore, though, he was a steal.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cThis has been probably the most fun I\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the major leagues, this team in particular,\xe2\x80\x9d said Trumbo, who can be a free agent after the season. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of it has probably been attributed to the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve played winning baseball. But for me personally, bouncing around a few times, you\xe2\x80\x99d like to find a home at some point and stay there and be a contributor. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping that\xe2\x80\x99s the case here. So far, so good.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles ranked ninth in the majors in runs last season, when they were .500. They are now in first place in the American League East, and they ranked fifth in runs before the All-Star break. Manny Machado, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 star third baseman, gave Trumbo much of the credit, and not just for his power.\xe2\x80\x9cHe makes everybody better,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe talk about hitting more often in the dugout. He keeps people going. If he misses a pitch or a guy\xe2\x80\x99s doing something, he picks it up, and we\xe2\x80\x99re helping each other out. He\xe2\x80\x99s done it all year. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have one of the best lineups in the league.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Catcher Matt Wieters said he had always found it tricky to make a game plan against Trumbo, who has a more compact swing than most sluggers.

A lot of pitchers try to go places that normally, to a big guy with long arms, you can get in on \xe2\x80\x94 and you can\xe2\x80\x99t get in on him.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cAlso, for a big, strong guy, he has one of the most advanced hitting approaches I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, as far as how much he thinks about the game and how much he thinks about what the pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s going to do to him.\xe2\x80\x9dTrumbo said playing for a team built on power had helped reinforce the mind-set of driving the ball. But for all of his numbers \xe2\x80\x94 he also had a career-best .923 on-base plus slugging percentage and a major-league-leading 202 total bases at the break \xe2\x80\x94 Trumbo said the opportunity mattered most.\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing I\xe2\x80\x99m most grateful for this year is, I\xe2\x80\x99ve played in every single game, and as a player that\xe2\x80\x99s all you can ask for,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou need those at-bats to be able to put up numbers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Finding a New PitchThe case of Drew Pomeranz, who was traded from San Diego to Boston on Thursday, shows just how quickly a pitcher can transform himself by paying attention while playing catch.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Pomeranz was chosen fifth over all in the 2010 draft, by the Indians out of the University of Mississippi. He was then dealt three times in the next five years: to Colorado for Ubaldo Jimenez in August 2011, to Oakland for Brett Anderson in December 2013 and to San Diego for Yonder Alonso in December (with other players in each deal).\xe2\x80\x9cI got to be around a lot of different people, a lot of great players,\xe2\x80\x9d Pomeranz said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I learned a lot from them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The player he may have learned the most from, though, was Travis Higgs, a former minor league catcher who played catch with Pomeranz in the winter at the University of San Francisco. Pomeranz had always thrown fastballs and curveballs, but he could never find a consistent third pitch. Then Higgs accidentally let loose a throw that acted like a cutter.

Pomeranz, though, learned a different way to do it.

Pomeranz threw cutters with 12.8 percent of his pitches for San Diego, according to FanGraphs, and significantly raised his rate of curveballs to 39.2 percent. With a more complete arsenal \xe2\x80\x94 and far fewer fastballs \xe2\x80\x94 he has taken advantage of the chance he sought this spring, after spending most of last season in Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen.

The Orioles look to get back on track when they play the second contest of their four-game series versus the host New York Yankees on Tuesday.Baltimore had won four in a row and six of seven before it answered Sunday's 5-2 setback to Tampa Bay with a 2-1 loss to New York, marking just its third loss to the Yankees in nine outings dating back to last season. Jonathan Schoop belted a solo homer on Monday to hit safely in 12 of 13 games this month, but he is batting just .226 in his career versus New York and 1-for-5 against Tuesday starter Nathan Eovaldi. Carlos Beltran continued his torrid stretch with three hits in the series opener to improve to 11-for-27 with four RBIs in his last six games. The veteran is batting .303 on the season with 19 homers, but is just 3-for-12 versus Tuesday starter Vance Worley. TV: 7:05 p.m. ET, MASN (Baltimore), YES (New York)PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Vance Worley (2-0, 2.87 ERA) vs. Yankees RH Nathan Eovaldi (7-6, 5.11)After tossing 1 2/3 innings of relief on Sunday, Worley will make the spot start two nights later versus New York. The 28-year-old didn't fare well in his lone encounter with the Yankees, allowing one run on three hits in two-thirds of an inning in a no-decision on June 4. Worley has two starts under his belt this season, with his longest outing lasting six innings in an 11-5 win against Texas on April 15.Eovaldi has also worked out of the bullpen of late and looks to exact revenge versus Baltimore, against which he was battered for five runs on eight hits in 5 1/3 innings in a no-decision on June 3. The 26-year-old hard-throwing right-hander has been rumored to be on the trade block, and a strong start can only help his stock. Eovaldi allowed two hits in 1 1/3 scoreless innings of relief against Boston on Friday.WALK-OFFS1.

Now let me be clear; Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s a young pitcher with a lot of potential, and he will improve. However Tampa hitters seemed to know which pitch was coming (and where) before even Bundy did.So if there\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing to say about yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s start, it would be that Bundy needs to mix his pitches better. Predictability in a pitcher isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good thing, and the Orioles suffered at the hands of Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s predictability yesterday. Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s line: 3.1 IP, 5 H, 4 R, 3 BB, 4 K.

However the home run parade for Tampa started immediately. Longoria smacked a solo homer in the last of the first, which I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure has landed yet. One inning later Bundy was a strike away from getting out of the inning, however Arcia\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer on a full count gave Tampa the lead at 3-1.\xc2\xa0Live Feed dylan bundyBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Why can't Kevin Gausman be more like Dylan Bundy?

However the O\xe2\x80\x99s got one back in the sixth on a solo homer by Alvarez, who\xe2\x80\x99s really been heating up of late.

These guys are good hitters up here and we\xe2\x80\x99ve just got to be able to make better pitches.And there\xe2\x80\x99s little doubt that Bundy will get the job done in terms of finding ways to utilize more off-speed pitches in games. This also shows the difference between starting and relieving. When you\xe2\x80\x99re the starter, you have to set the tone for the game.

Really, the only thing that could have made it absolutely perfect is if Flaherty had somehow followed up this moment by hitting a home run against Chapman. Unfortunately for the Orioles, Flaherty hit a broken bat grounder to second base and the game ended. He made the Yankees work for it - the ball somehow grounded itself into the broken bat, twice, and almost slowed down enough for Flaherty to reach first... but then, almost only counts in horseshoes, hand grenades, and nuclear missiles.

Tillmans\xe2\x80\x99 12 wins at the time, ranked third best in the majors but apparently it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough for Tillman to earn his second All-Star selection. Tillman is only one of six players in the majors with at least 12 wins and is a huge reason why the Baltimore Orioles found themselves in first place at the midway point of the season.In his first start after the All-Star break, Tillman continued his red-hot July. On Saturday, the right-handed joined Chicago White Sox\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Sale as the only two American League pitchers with at least 13 wins. Tillman notched his 13th win after pitching seven excellent innings with three strikeouts and only yielding a run in a 2-3 win against the Tampa Bay Rays. Not only does Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s 13 wins rank second in the American League, but is also second best in the entire Major League. The Orioles ace joins San Francisco Giants Johnny Cueto and Washington Nationals Stephen Strasburg as the only 13-game winners. Following an up and down June, Tillman has tossed seven innings and an earned run in each of his July starts. The 28-year-old in three starts in July is 3-0 with a 1.29 ERA and a .169 opponent batting average. Better yet, Tillman is undefeated (6-0) in nine starts against American League East opponents tossing 54.1 innings with a 3.48 ERA. The O\xe2\x80\x99s have won all nine of those games as well.

The rest of the Orioles pitchers who have started a game this year have just a combined 28 quality starts in 70 starts. Tillman has accomplished some impressive feats so far this season that includes breaking a Baltimore Orioles all-time record on June 19th as the quickest Baltimore Orioles pitcher to 10 wins since Jimmy Key did it in 1997. Also, his 12 wins pre all-star break is Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s career best. Not only that, but the Orioles ace leads the team\xe2\x80\x99s starters in wins (12), ERA (3.41), games started (19), innings pitched (113.1), strikeouts (98), opponent batting average (.232), and WHIP (1.23).

Then came an All-Star catcher (Matt Wieters), a former National League home run champ (Pedro Alvarez) and a shortstop with five 20-homer seasons (J. J. Hardy).

Vance Worley, a veteran who has been working in long relief, starts Tuesday in place of Ubaldo Jimenez. The Orioles lavished a four-year, $50 million contract on Jimenez \xe2\x80\x94 or $1 million for each of his A.L.-leading 50 walks this season \xe2\x80\x94 that runs through 2017. Now, with a 7.38 E.R.A., he has no clear value to the team. Perhaps Worley can be an answer, but the Orioles badly need to upgrade their rotation before the Aug. 1 nonwaiver deadline.

The Orioles have been quiet so far, but their players understand the calendar.\xe2\x80\x9cWe think about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Britton said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t control it, obviously, but I think we all know what we need. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear. So you hope that we would make a move to help that out. If we do, it\xe2\x80\x99s great.

The Orioles have done that before, trading for Miller in their 2014 playoff run. Miller came from the Red Sox for Eduardo Rodriguez, who is now in Boston\xe2\x80\x99s rotation, and helped the Orioles reach the A.L.C.S.They lost four in a row to the Royals, all by one or two runs. The Royals went on to reach Game 7 of that year\xe2\x80\x99s World Series, then won their encore last fall. They, not the Orioles, are thus the model for the back-to-front pitching staff.\xe2\x80\x9cI know the Royals get a lot of credit, and deservedly so, because they won the World Series; we haven\xe2\x80\x99t done that,\xe2\x80\x9d Britton said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve been building through our bullpen for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  They have been building that way for five seasons, to be exact, with a lot of wins \xe2\x80\x94 but no pennants \xe2\x80\x94 to validate their style.

They arrived at Yankee Stadium two weeks from the trade deadline, eight and a half games back in the American League East, and hosting first-place Baltimore for four games.If the Yankees were going to get into or out of the playoff race for good, there was no time like the present.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re at,\xe2\x80\x9d catcher Brian McCann said after the Yankees took a first step in the right direction with a 2-1 victory over the Orioles. \xe2\x80\x9cA little over two months of baseball left and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to start winning.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Yankees were buoyed by a confluence of rare events: Ivan Nova escaping trouble at every turn, Alex Rodriguez hitting his first home run in a month, and Aroldis Chapman drawing oohs and aahs, shattering a bat and throwing fastballs that registered at 105 miles per hour.

UPDATE: The roster move is now official and Henry Urrutia has been designated for assignment. The only surprising thing about that is that it took this long for them to do it. Urrutia had been demoted from Norfolk to Bowie earlier this year and when you are his age and headed the wrong direction, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a great sign. (end update)    Borbon, 30, is a veteran of four MLB seasons who has been kicking around the minors since his last big league action in 2013. Over his MLB career, he has batted .272/.318/.347 in 863 plate appearances to date.    The question of why they would call up Borbon from Bowie rather than one of the Norfolk outfielders is likely answered by none of the Norfolk outfielders really forcing their way into the picture. Borbon, a lefty like Kim, has batted .289/.353/.373 for Bowie this year. That\xe2\x80\x99s not all that great either, but it\xe2\x80\x99s enough, apparently. Baltimore Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s Dan Connolly tweeted that Borbon is \xe2\x80\x9ca favorite of Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s for his outfield defense and speed.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s actually even good at one or both of those things.    Oh, and on the subject of injuries, Matt Wieters is day-to-day after being hit by a pitch in the foot in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game. The X-rays came back clean but Wieters is also absent from tonight\xe2\x80\x99s starting lineup. Which gets us this starting nine for Vance Worley\xe2\x80\x99s third start as an Oriole:  Adam Jones - CF Joey Rickard - LF Manny Machado - 3B Mark Trumbo - RF Jonathan Schoop - 2B Pedro Alvarez - DH J.J. Hardy - SS Caleb Joseph - C Ryan Flaherty - 1B  That hardly looks like the lineup of a first place team, but actually, no matter what happens in tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game, the Orioles will end the night in first place. Get well soon, all you ailing Orioles. They need you.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

As we sit in the middle of the 2016 season, the lack of top prospects within the Birds organization is more than evident.     It dominates the O\xe2\x80\x99s minor-league storylines and tends to blind views of favorable storylines that pop up every night.  Is the farm system in Baltimore as rich as its ever been? Hardly. But at the end of the day, that simple fact sets up \xe2\x80\x9cdiamond in the rough\xe2\x80\x9d situations throughout the organization - opportunities for young unknowns to burst onto the scene.  And thus far in 2016, plenty of firepower has emerged for at-least a second look.     Aderlin Rodriguez - Frederick When the Mets released Rodriguez at the end of last season, they were likely fairly convinced that the end of his road would be near. From 2012-2014, he was a middle-of-the-pack hitter with power potential and errors aplenty at the corner infield slots. Bottom line, he had appeared to be maxed out.     But don\xe2\x80\x99t tell that to the 2016 version of Aderlin Rodriguez. Whatever he\xe2\x80\x99s done since entering the Orioles organization, it\xe2\x80\x99s been working. Over 89 games with Frederick, Rodriguez is hitting .314 with a .911 OPS.  He\xe2\x80\x99s combined for 41 extra-base hits, including 18 doubles and 17 round-trippers. His strikeout rate is slightly high at 23-percent, but in the grand totality of his game, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a terrible concern.     He\xe2\x80\x99s primarily locking down first base for Frederick, but he\xe2\x80\x99s played 90 innings at the hot corner where he has plenty of experience from his time with the Mets.  And while the makeup of the Orioles system doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly bode well for his future with the Orioles, certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t count the 24-year-old out of future trade discussions.  Cole Billingsley - Aberdeen It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit odd to talk about a successful outfielder in the Orioles system, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Luckily, Billingsley is proving that trends are meant to be broken ... well, at-least through the first 73 at-bats of his first steps in pro ball.     The former South Alabama standout is crushing opposing pitching this season, starting with a .329/.417/.521 trio. Drafted in the 16th round last month, the 22-year-old Ironbird is already finding a way to make it work in the pros.  Sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s early and it\xe2\x80\x99s short-season single A baseball, but why not celebrate a non-catcher/first baseman doing big things at the dish in the system?  What\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging about Billingsley is the sheer potential that could lie ahead. He hit .302 in 2013 before sitting out his entire sophomore season as a medical redshirt. In 2015, he exploded with a .345 average, .437 OBP and 30 stolen bases (which he does have three of in his first 20 games in Aberdeen).  If he follows the path he\xe2\x80\x99s been sprinting since graduating high-school, the former Team USA 16U star might just find his way onto 2017\xe2\x80\x99s top minor-league prospect watch list.  Yermin Mercedes - Delmarva Mercedes is a catcher, which might put him in a difficult position to climb up the ladder moving forward. However, his 2016 numbers are simply too impressive to ignore   - perhaps for other teams around the league.     After spending 2011-2013 in the Dominican Summer League, Mercedes emerged onto the scene last season with a very respectable year in Delmarva. He hit .272 with eight home runs in 64 games, working a total .456 slugging percentage. Not bad, but not nearly close to the totals he\xe2\x80\x99s collected this campaign.  Through 82 games, Mercedes is absolutely crushing the baseball with a .352 average and .558 slugging percentage. He\xe2\x80\x99s getting on base 40 percent of the time as a staple of the middle of Delmarva\xe2\x80\x99s lineup, hitting 11 home runs with 53 RBI in the process.  His .390 average against left-handers is just one more reason why he\xe2\x80\x99s become the clear contender for Orioles minor-leaguer of the year. And depending on what he looks like behind the dish, Mercedes could eventually emerge as a premier prize in a future trade situation.  Next Wednesday, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go over three surprise arms toeing the rubber in the 2016 Orioles system.   ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Yankees\\u2019 Best Move?

In Aroldis Chapman, they have precisely the kind of player to make rival executives lose their sense of reason.It has happened before, and with a closer nowhere near the caliber of Chapman, who conveniently hit 105 miles an hour on the radar gun against Baltimore on Monday. He was not needed Tuesday as the Yankees beat the Orioles, 7-1.\xe2\x80\x9cWe just need to keep playing good baseball,\xe2\x80\x9d catcher Brian McCann said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re playing a lot of teams in our division, and we knew coming back from the All-Star break this is a huge homestand for us.\xe2\x80\x9dAt 47-46, the Yankees have at least modest hope of squeezing into contention and keeping their roster intact. But selling can have its advantages, too. Just ask Dan Duquette, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 executive vice president for baseball operations, who traded his closer in 1997 for pillars of a future championship team.

A confluence of factors made the deal happen, and while the Yankees cannot count on such good luck now, they should wait as long as they can, hoping that a team will decide it simply cannot live without Chapman or Andrew Miller.

They were .500 before the All-Star break and then lost two before winning three in a row. On Wednesday they will try to lift their record to two games above .500 for the first time since April 12.

But it\xe2\x80\x99s been frustrating because I feel like if we can get over that mark, we can build on it.\xe2\x80\x9dBarring a sudden surge in coming games against the contenders Baltimore, San Francisco and Houston \xe2\x80\x94 and the also-ran Tampa Bay Rays \xe2\x80\x94 the Yankees may find themselves in roughly the same spot in the hours before the 4 p.m. nonwaiver trading deadline on Aug. 1.

The Mariners were in first place in the American League West and happened to be playing at Fenway Park, where they took a 7-2 lead into the bottom of the eighth inning.

Right in the middle of it, Slocumb pitched a scoreless ninth inning for the Red Sox.\xe2\x80\x9cHe threw the ball great, and I think Lou Piniella liked him,\xe2\x80\x9d Duquette said, referring to the Mariners\xe2\x80\x99 manager, who was famously competitive and impatient. \xe2\x80\x9cLou had seen him perform well against his team. Slocumb had a pretty good slurve to go with his fastball, and he\xe2\x80\x99d pitched as well as he could pitch against Seattle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Generally, though, Slocumb was not pitching well; after blowing the save in Kansas City the next day, his E.R.A. rose to 5.79. But he had saved 63 games in the prior two seasons, and the Mariners were scrambling. Earlier on July 31, they had traded their top prospect, outfielder Jose Cruz Jr., to Toronto for relievers Paul Spoljaric and Mike Timlin.

The delay had somewhat diminished Varitek\xe2\x80\x99s market value, and the Mariners had another young catcher, Dan Wilson, on their roster. Varitek was available, and when Duquette said he also wanted a pitcher, Woodward suggested Lowe.Two of Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s scouts, Eddie Haas and Gary Rajsich, liked Lowe\xe2\x80\x99s athleticism and approved the idea, despite Lowe\xe2\x80\x99s poor showing with the Mariners that season: 2-4 with a 6.96 E.R.A.

Varitek was back there again in 2007 when the Red Sox won another title.Duquette was long gone by then, dismissed after an ownership change in 2002. But he attended the ceremony when the Red Sox put Varitek in their Hall of Fame.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a terrific deal for the Red Sox,\xe2\x80\x9d Duquette said, understatedly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d like to make a deal like that every year, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t always come along.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Yet sometimes they do, and the Yankees would be wise to use their considerable leverage. Several division leaders \xe2\x80\x94 the Giants, the Chicago Cubs, the Cleveland Indians and the Texas Rangers \xe2\x80\x94 have an obvious need for a closer like Chapman or Miller. If they endure a well-timed bullpen blowup, they just might make an impulsive deal for a quick fix, no matter the cost.

On Sunday night when NY played Boston, ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s crew was very careful to say that decisions were being made as they spoke as to whether New York was going to buy or sell at the deadline. New York of course won that game, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the first two from the first place O\xe2\x80\x99s.So again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if the Birds are trying to help New York. But if the word on the street happened to be that NY was going to sell, you have to wonder if that isn\xe2\x80\x99t starting to change. If they look at the standings and see that they\xe2\x80\x99re now only 6.5 games out of first\xe2\x80\xa6you never know, right? And that\xe2\x80\x99s all the Orioles really need; a New York team that suddenly becomes an underdog story and captures the attention of the nation as they come out of nowhere to get to the postseason.Vance Worley was ineffective as a starter last night, although it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to win when you only put up one run as a team. Worley\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.1 IP, 3 H, 3 R, 4 BB, 3 K. He gave up a two-run homer to Castro in the second, and he was also responsible for the run that scored in the fifth on Ellsbury\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single.\xc2\xa0Live Feed vance worleyBaltimore Orioles interested in Vance Worley reunion The Baltimore WireDetroit Tigers: Recently-Released Players Worth Taking a Flier on Motor City BengalsWashington Nationals: Vance Worley Could Provide Much Needed Rotation Depth District on DeckChicago Cubs: Potential suitors for vacant rotation spots Cubbies CribDetroit Tigers: Five Non-Tendered Players Who Are Potential Fits Motor City BengalsBaltimore Orioles Acquire Former Rule Five Pick Logan Verrett The Baltimore WireThe O\xe2\x80\x99s tried to put up somewhat of a fight when Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double cut it to 3-1 in the sixth.

Castro smacked a two-RBI double in the last of the inning, and Headley a two-run homer in the last of the eighth.So the question is whether or not New York still views themselves as sellers as the deadline aproaches. One would hope that no team would be compulsive enough to allow a couple of games to influence their thinking.

07/21/2016,"[('Orioles snap losing streak by beating Yankees, 4-1 ...', ' The Orioles offense may go through slumps, as all teams do, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t keep them down forever. After sleepwalking through the first three games against the Yankees, after deploying B and C team lineups due to sickness in the clubhouse and injuries to key players, the O\xe2\x80\x99s bats finally got going, at least a little bit, on Thursday afternoon, beating the Yankees, 4-1. Although the O\xe2\x80\x99s did have Manny Machado and Chris Davis back from battling the mystery illness, they were still without Matt Wieters and Adam Jones due to assorted injuries. Fortunately, their best starting pitcher, Chris Tillman, was on the mound. Tillman pitched well for seven innings, the Orioles offense got a few clutch hits, then the All-Star duo of Brad Brach and Zach Britton took over to close things out. That might not be how they drew it up back in March, but it\xe2\x80\x99s about as good as a game can go for the O\xe2\x80\x99s as things stand right now. Scoring in the first inning can be done The Orioles scored not only one, but two runs in the first inning. Yes, it can be done! Not that they got any help in getting these runs across from today\xe2\x80\x99s leadoff hitter, Nolan Reimold, who\xe2\x80\x99s batting .224 since the beginning of May. It still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the A-list lineup even with Machado and Davis back.    There are plenty of other good hitters to go around, like the best friend tandem of Machado and Jonathan Schoop. It was Schoop who got the first inning rally started with a single, moving up to third when his buddy added another single.    With how this road trip had gone to date, getting a runner in scoring position was, in a facetious yet totally real way, putting the Orioles right where Yankees starter, and birthday boy, CC Sabathia wanted them to be. The ice cold Mark Trumbo popped out for the second out. Trumbo hasn\xe2\x80\x99t driven in a run since the All-Star break. But Sabathia walked Davis to load the bases for J.J. Hardy, and Hardy delivered a hard smash that Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle.    Two runs scored when the ball caromed into shallow left field and the Orioles had their first clutch hit of the decade. The preceding sentence has not been fact-checked. Staked to this 2-0 lead, Tillman proceeded to walk the first batter he saw in the bottom half of the inning. A base hit put two men on base with none out. Here we go again. But no, actually, Tillman induced a double play ground ball from the Night\xe2\x80\x99s King, Carlos Beltran, defusing the worst of the tension. The second inning saw another spot of trouble for Tillman after Gregorius led off with a double. That run eventually scored on a Starlin Castro single, cutting the Orioles lead to 2-1. Another double play snuffed out that possible rally.    Pitchers entering a groove That was only the second inning and as it worked out, the Yankees did not get another runner in scoring position for the remainder of the game. Tillman entered cruise control mode. Four of the next five innings, the Yankees went 1-2-3 against Tillman. It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely what the team needs from their best starting pitcher in order to break a losing streak at four games. The term ""stopper"" is one often thrown around hopefully rather than reflecting reality, but that\xe2\x80\x99s what Tillman was today. They needed it. Sabathia got into a groove, too, after allowing the two runs in the first inning. He retired 18 out of the next 20 Orioles he faced after the Hardy single. That took him all the way into the seventh inning where, with the bottom of the Orioles lineup coming up, he seemed set to keep cruising. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how it worked out. Caleb Joseph, of all people, started off a rally with a single. Joseph has hardly hit a lick lately but he had two hits in this game, despite it being a day game after a night game. Joseph caught both! So that actually can be done. Crazy. Anyway, newly-minted Oriole Julio Borbon got another base hit behind Joseph, getting another actual rally going for the top of the lineup. Reimold struck out. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry though, because here\xe2\x80\x99s Schoop to save the day! Schoop delivered a clutch double for two crucial insurance runs, putting the Orioles up 4-1.    With Tillman rocking and rolling, that was more than enough. Tillman went on to finish the seventh. His line for the day was beautiful: One run on four hits and two walks, with seven strikeouts, in seven innings. Tillman threw 102 pitches on the day and earned a well-deserved 14th win on the season. Hopes remain for the first O\xe2\x80\x99s 20-game winner since Mike Boddicker in 1984. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s got time. He\xe2\x80\x99s probably got 11-12 starts remaining and six more wins to get. Oh, and his ERA is now 3.18, good for eighth best among AL starters. Brach and Britton ended the game with little drama, combining for only one man reaching base in the two innings they pitched. The combined ERA for this tandem is now 1.52. That is also good. Britton remains perfect on save opportunities this season: 30 out of 30. The latest road trip from hell is over with. The Orioles return to Baltimore to kick off a three game series against a fellow contending team, the Indians. They\xe2\x80\x99ve really wasted an opportunity in this series. The Red Sox, who\xe2\x80\x99ve now passed the O\xe2\x80\x99s, were playing a fellow first place team in the Giants and still managed to gain ground. Boston now gets to play the pathetic Twins while the O\xe2\x80\x99s face a first place team.    Nothing they can do about it now except for come home, get well, and get back to winning games. In an interesting twist, the 7:05 series opener will feature two starting pitchers picked back-to-back in the 2011 draft: #3 and #4 overall picks Trevor Bauer and Dylan Bundy.

There was Michael Pineda, pitching out of trouble instead of into it. There was Mark Teixeira, picking up the offense instead of letting it down.Why, there was even the 39-year-old Carlos Beltran, given a respite as the designated hitter, legging out a bunt for a base hit.Suddenly, after more than three months of sporadic, sputtering baseball, these Yankees are playing as if they intend to have a say in the playoff chase after all, winning their fourth consecutive game in their division, a 5-0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.The victory moved the Yankees two games over .500 for the first time since April 12 and drew them within six games of Boston, which moved past Baltimore into first place in the American League East on Wednesday night.

Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s refreshed, everybody\xe2\x80\x99s recharged, and then the guys that went have obviously been doing it all year. Also, the people that might have been a little uncomfortable in the beginning are getting comfortable. When everybody is playing for each other. It makes it a fun environment.\xe2\x80\x9dWinning is not the only thing that is contagious around Yankee Stadium at the moment. So, too, is a virus in the clubhouse of the Orioles, who have lost the first three games of this series, which concludes Thursday. First baseman Chris Davis has missed each of those losses, and he was joined on the sideline by third baseman Manny Machado and Manager Buck Showalter, who took ill Wednesday. Showalter is expected to return Thursday.Catcher Matt Wieters and reliever Zach Britton were the first to become sick, picking up a bug at the All-Star Game in San Diego. The coaches Wayne Kirby and Dom Chiti have also become sick in recent days.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 pitching has not helped. Pineda followed Masahiro Tanaka, Ivan Nova and Nathan Eovaldi \xe2\x80\x94 who had each allowed one run in the previous three victories \xe2\x80\x94 and did them one better. It is the first time since 2003 that the Yankees have allowed one run or fewer in four consecutive games.

But Pineda struck out Nolan Reimold and Ryan Flaherty with sliders to escape. The usually emotive Pineda exhorted himself, then put his head down and ambled to the dugout.After Mark Trumbo doubled and took third on a fly ball in the sixth, Pineda fanned Hardy \xe2\x80\x94 who was 9 for 17 in his career against him, including two hits Tuesday \xe2\x80\x94 with a 96-mile-per-hour fastball and then Reimold with his 113th and final pitch, a slider. On his way to the dugout, Pineda \xe2\x80\x94 who has so often seemed to find trouble in the most benign circumstances \xe2\x80\x94 got a congratulatory hand slap from Manager Joe Girardi.\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you get outs with runners in scoring position, those are the most crucial outs of a game,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s usually the difference in a game.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  As encouraging as Pineda\xe2\x80\x99s performance was, the most buoying one might have been by Teixeira, who had missed the previous three games after fouling a ball off his foot. Teixeira hit a solo home run to right in the fourth and drew two walks. The second, with the bases loaded, put the Yankees ahead, 3-0.

He has been afflicted by a variety of ailments \xe2\x80\x94 his neck, a knee and most recently his foot \xe2\x80\x94 and when he has been healthy, he has not hit. He began Wednesday with a .186 batting average and had endured a career-worst home run drought.\xe2\x80\x9cThis has been brutal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teixeira, whose eight-year, $180 million contract expires after this season. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been terrible.

Ronald Torreyes, making an emergency start for third baseman Chase Headley \xe2\x80\x94 who was not at the ballpark for personal reasons \xe2\x80\x94 tripled and scored.And Beltran, who hit a solo homer, his 20th of the season, also dropped down a bunt single against a shift that moved Jacoby Ellsbury to second.

Although it seems easy, closing a glove around a baseball is sometimes harder than it looks.Case in point: Thursday afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game at Yankee Stadium. On three occasions, Yankees infielders failed to secure a ball, and each time, the defensive miscue led to a run. As a result, the Yankees were unable to complete a four-game sweep of the Baltimore Orioles, falling by 4-1.C. C. Sabathia pitched well on his 36th birthday, but he was foiled by soft base hits. Sabathia tossed six and two-thirds innings, allowing two runs in the first inning and two more in the seventh.\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he gave us a gritty performance today \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Joe Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up a lot of hard-hit balls, and you look up and there\xe2\x80\x99s four runs on the board.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 initial hit came when Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius did not cleanly scoop a slow roller off the bat of Jonathon Schoop in the first inning. The Orioles eventually loaded the bases for J. J. Hardy, who hit a sharp line drive that deflected off the top of Gregorius\xe2\x80\x99s mitt and fell into left field, bringing home two runs.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Sabathia allowed only one hit over his next five innings before allowing back-to-back one-out singles in the seventh. That brought up Schoop again, and he doubled to right, easily scoring Caleb Joseph. Right fielder Carlos Beltran fired the ball to Mark Teixeira at first base as Julio Borbon rounded third, but Teixeira dropped the throw, and Borbon scored.Despite having his bullpen ready, Girardi chose to stay with Sabathia in the seventh. After the game, Girardi repeatedly defended his decision, pointing to Sabathia\xe2\x80\x99s previous success against Schoop, who was 3 for 13 until that point against him.\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re probably extremely frustrated, because when you\xe2\x80\x99re not giving up hard contact, you\xe2\x80\x99re making good pitches, and it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating for him and for us that they\xe2\x80\x99re turning into base hits,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said, adding about the Schoop at-bat, \xe2\x80\x9cYou look at the base hit, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hit hard, it was just extremely well placed.\xe2\x80\x9d Sign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

Over all, the Yankees sluggers Beltran, Brian McCann, Teixeira and Alex Rodriguez, who was moved down to seventh in the order, were hitless in a combined 14 at-bats.

In addition to dropping the first three games against the Yankees, the Orioles fell out of first place in the American League East, passed by the Boston Red Sox. On Wednesday, Manager Buck Showalter, first baseman Chris Davis and third baseman Manny Machado were absent from the game because of flulike symptoms that have spread through the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse.The bug reportedly originated at the All-Star Game in San Diego last week, infecting catcher Matt Wieters and reliever Zach Britton. Despite his sparkling record, Tillman was not selected as an All-Star, but he is probably happy to be in good health.Showalter did not hold his customary pregame news conference with reporters on Thursday, but he was in the dugout to manage the game.

East. They shaved their deficit slightly, although three teams remain ahead of them in the division standings.\xe2\x80\x9cI think you have to look at it as you took three of four from a good Baltimore team, and you have to move on,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said.INSIDE PITCHThe Yankees optioned NICK GOODY to Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and recalled CHAD GREEN, who pitched two and a third scoreless innings in relief Thursday. \xe2\x80\xa6 CHASE HEADLEY pinch-hit in the eighth inning after missing Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game for personal reasons. Headley said after the game that his son, Colt, 4, had an operation over the All-Star break last week and had recently had complications.

Waiting for Another Team to Act JULY 19, 2016                       ', 'www.nytimes.com'), ('Baseball Hall of Fame: Do any current Orioles have ...', ' This weekend marks the induction weekend for the Baseball Hall of Fame. Two great players, Ken Griffey Jr. and Mike Piazza, will be inducted in the festivities this weekend. Congratulations to them for great careers.    As has been the case every year since the 2007 induction of Cal Ripken Jr., Orioles fans won\xe2\x80\x99t have much of a stake in the proceedings. Until the HOF voting baseball writers get their heads out of their butts and acknowledge the undeniable Hall of Fame-caliber career of Mike Mussina, that will continue to be the case. Whether they get around to recognizing Mussina\xe2\x80\x99s greatness or not, the fact remains that it will be a while still beyond Mussina before there\xe2\x80\x99s another potential Hall of Fame Oriole. The best Orioles of the 2000s, Melvin Mora and Brian Roberts, aren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly Hall of Famers. Neither is Nick Markakis headed towards Cooperstown. That means we must pin our hopes on the current crop of Orioles. Mussina, by the way, improved to being named on 43% of ballots returned this year. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from only 24.6% the year before. Good progress there and he has seven years remaining to be elected. He will have to pass the 75% threshold to eventually to get there.    Is there someone on the team now who could end the Orioles Hall of Fame drought?    To keep things simple, this article is working under the assumption that it would take reaching what are generally viewed as automatic benchmarks - like 3,000 hits or 500 home runs - in order for a player to be inducted. Of course, by the time today\xe2\x80\x99s great Orioles have retired and find themselves on HOF ballots, standards may have changed somewhat. It\xe2\x80\x99s a different era of the game after all. There\xe2\x80\x99s always a chance, too, that the Orioles could end up with some kind of narrative-based HOF candidate - someone with either a very, very good peak, or a lot of career hardware (All-Star teams, Gold Gloves), or someone with particularly notable postseason success. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time since the Orioles have had an MVP and longer still since they won a World Series. That kind of glory has been in short supply.    Adam Jones  Age: 30 (31 on August 1)MLB Seasons: 11 You can make a strong argument that, at this moment, Jones is the greatest 21st century Oriole to date. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite passed Roberts and Mora in Wins Above Replacement, but he\xe2\x80\x99s close and he has the advantage of actually being good on good Orioles teams. What\xe2\x80\x99s that worth to a HOF cause? Probably not much. For a few years there, Jones was cranking out 180+ hits per season, a pace that would only take him something like 16-17 seasons to get to 3,000. That fell off last year and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like it\xe2\x80\x99s getting any better this year. Assorted injuries have cost Jones both playing time and performance the last two seasons. He has 95 hits in 94 team games. If he averages 162 hits per season from here on, it will take him almost another ten seasons to get to 3,000. Unless Jones has Ichiro Suzuki-like longevity, it\xe2\x80\x99s not happening.    Jones does have some hardware in his favor, like four Gold Gloves and five All-Star selections, but it seems unlikely he\xe2\x80\x99ll get any more Gold Gloves and unless his performance rebounds, All-Star teams are looking like they\xe2\x80\x99re done with too. Chris Davis  Age: 30MLB Seasons: 9 So far this season, Davis has hit 22 home runs. That puts him on pace for about 38 home runs. If he hits another 16 home runs this season, he\xe2\x80\x99ll end his age 30 season with 241 career home runs. From there, Davis would need another 259 home runs. If he played another decade, he\xe2\x80\x99d need to average 26 home runs per season. If he plays for eight more years - his current Orioles contract plus two more - he\xe2\x80\x99ll need to average a bit more than 32 home runs per season for those eight years. The good news for Davis is that the fewest home runs he\xe2\x80\x99s had in a season since 2012 is 26. He\xe2\x80\x99s had 33 or more in three of the four seasons and is on pace to top that number this year as well. Given that he seems to have years where he slumps more, can he bank enough home runs in 45+ or 50+ home run seasons to make up for slump years? Or can he just hit home runs more consistently from season to season? I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bet on it. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get into the Hall of Fame.    Manny Machado  Age: 24MLB Seasons: 5 Machado is easily the most promising of the bunch since he started out young, just in his age 19 season when he debuted. It helps, too, that Machado was good as soon as he debuted and has gotten even better as a hitter ever since. There are a lot of ways Machado could make it beyond getting these automatic benchmark numbers. He\xe2\x80\x99s that good. But as far as notching those, starting young gives you a good chance since you have more years to pull things off. Machado already had 511 hits in the bag before his age 23 season. He\xe2\x80\x99s on pace to get another 194 hits this season. At that kind of annual average, it\xe2\x80\x99d only take Machado a bit shy of 13 more seasons to reach the 3,000 plateau. Of course he probably won\xe2\x80\x99t keep up that pace. Something like 500 home runs seems less likely unless Machado shows off the ability to crank out 40+ homers in a season. He hit 35 last year and is on pace for 33 this year.  That would leave him with 101 home runs, or 399 to go. At a 33 home runs per season pace, that would take him 13 more seasons to get there. It is do-able, and he\xe2\x80\x99d still potentially have his late 30s to scratch out some dingers if his pace falls off a bit. Don\xe2\x80\x99t bet in that either, though.    Machado has already made three All-Star teams and won two Gold Gloves. If the voters don\xe2\x80\x99t give him another Gold Glove this year, that would be a surprise. Depending on how he finishes off the season (and how the Orioles finish off the season) Machado might even find himself in the MVP conversation. Voters do pay attention to that stuff. What if Machado was MVP this year or next and ended up with a number of career top 5 finishes? That\xe2\x80\x99s worth something. On the other hand, as far as getting the next Orioles Hall of Famer, there is one grim thought we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to contemplate with Machado. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be a free agent after two more full seasons. He could go on to play his peak years and 30s and really rack up HOF-caliber numbers and then go into the HOF with a different cap. Zach Britton  Age: 28MLB Seasons: 6 Not to get all carried away here, but the three year stretch that Britton is on compares favorably to any three year stretch of Mariano Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s career that you could name. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying Britton will go on to have a Rivera-like career - though it is noteworthy that Rivera only became the closer in his age 27 season; Britton was a year younger. There\xe2\x80\x99s not really a benchmark automatic for saves. Rivera and Trevor Hoffman will end up in there. Both of those guys are over 600. There are Hall of Famers in the 300s, like Dennis Eckersley (390) and Rollie Fingers (341), but the four guys from 400-500, including Billy Wagner and former Oriole Lee Smith, are not in. Would 500 saves get Britton in? Let\xe2\x80\x99s say that it would. Britton\xe2\x80\x99s on pace for 51 saves, or 21 more than he has now. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be pessimistic and give him 45, or 15 more. He would have 115 saves after his age 28 season and would need 385 more. That would require him to average 32 saves per season until his age 40 season.    Saves are funny, of course, because they kind of require a good team. You need some leads to have to get saves. Will the Orioles, if Britton stays with the Orioles, be able to be so consistently good? Will Britton himself be so good for so long? Don\xe2\x80\x99t bet on that, either. Still, the longer his dominant streak continues, the more it\xe2\x80\x99s worth pondering a little bit. Of course, Britton, too, has only two full seasons before becoming a free agent, and he also may be pricing himself out of what the Orioles are willing to pay to a closer, even a great closer. So if he went on to get the last 300 saves somewhere else, well, that probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put him in as an Oriole either, if he even made it to that point. Buck Showalter  Age: 60MLB Seasons Managed: 18 With Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s win, Showalter now has 1,394 wins as a manager. That\xe2\x80\x99s good for 29th all time on the managerial list. Of the 28 managers ahead of him, 20 are in the Hall of Fame already. Two of the retired ones may get elected, and the three active managers ahead of him could also get elected. By season\xe2\x80\x99s end, Showalter will likely be in 25th place on this list. Even if we go for something of a pessimistic outcome and suppose that Showalter will only average 81 wins per season for the rest of his Orioles contract, he would end that contract with 1,583 wins. That\xe2\x80\x99s 21st all time. Would that, along with Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s winning the Manager of the Year award with three different teams in three different decades, be enough to make him a Hall of Fame manager? You\xe2\x80\x99d think so, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt he\xe2\x80\x99d go in as an Oriole.    Plus, he was in that one episode of Seinfeld. ** Even if Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s an automatic shoo-in for the HOF, Orioles fans will be waiting a bit to get to celebrate him. If he plays out his Orioles contract and retires after 2018, he would be eligible to be inducted following the 2023 season. The Expansion Era Committee, which elects managers, would next meet to consider managers during the 2025 Winter Meetings for induction in 2026. So if Showalter manages that long, if he is elected in his first crack at the ballot, and if he is inducted as an Oriole, then we could look forward to that around this time in 2026. I will be 42 years old. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to be good for long enough to have a Hall of Fame career and it\xe2\x80\x99s even harder to actually get elected. Maybe one of these Orioles is already on the way to a Hall of Fame career and we just don\xe2\x80\x99t know it yet.

Going along with an earlier rumor that the Orioles were scouting Padres starter Andrew Cashner on Thursday, there\xe2\x80\x99s also this from ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Jerry Crasnick: The O\xe2\x80\x99s have talked to the Padres about outfielder Melvin Upton.     Oh, but it\xe2\x80\x99s even better than that! Ken Rosenthal adds that the Orioles are discussing with the Padres a swap that would send Ubaldo Jimenez to San Diego. He also says a trade is not close, and that the Padres would want a prospect in addition to Jimenez. Now, THAT is interesting. Acquiring an outfielder as well as (or instead of) a starter would be a bit of a swerve, but maybe the O\xe2\x80\x99s feel like this is their best chance to improve. Rule 5 pick Joey Rickard is on the shelf for 4-6 weeks, Buck Showalter said following Friday\xe2\x80\x99s game. Nolan Reimold has a .618 OPS since the beginning of May. What both of those things mean is that there\xe2\x80\x99s room for the Orioles to improve their outfield situation. Is Upton the guy? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I guess it depends on the deal.    Upton will be owed about $10 million for the remainder of this season, and he\xe2\x80\x99s signed for $16.45 million for next season as well. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money for a guy who, over his current contract, has produced a .221/.292/.361 batting line.    Things have gotten better for Upton since going to the Padres, though, and he\xe2\x80\x99s working with a .260/.309/.448 this season. Not great, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something - especially since he\xe2\x80\x99s a righty batter who hits left-handed pitchers better. If he was going to be a platoon bat, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money for that too. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a good chance that Upton would represent a bit of an upgrade defensively, though it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear where they might choose to play the 31-year-old (32 next month) when Hyun Soo Kim returns.     Upton over in right field would probably be an improvement over Mark Trumbo in that spot, though Upton has played most of his innings in left field for the Padres this season. He\xe2\x80\x99s been good as a left fielder, +9 Defensive Runs Saved. That\xe2\x80\x99s someone who will be getting to more line drives. With the Orioles clearing Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s money in the process, that changes the equation further. Between the rest of this season and next season, Upton would cost about $5 million more. Still, it makes sense that the Padres would want the O\xe2\x80\x99s to give up a prospect. Upton is the more immediately useful player. San Diego would have to try to reclaim a guy with a 7.38 ERA this season. That\xe2\x80\x99s a project. As ever, remember the first rule of baseball rumors: Probably nothing will happen. This one would sure be something though, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
07/23/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Ubaldo Jimenez Trade Discussions', 'Jun 7, 2016; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez (31) is congratulated by first baseman Chris Davis (19) after being taken out of the game in the fifth inning against the Kansas City Royals at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles won 9-1. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have been reported over the past 24 hours to be in possible trade discussions with the San Diego Padres involving Ubaldo Jimenez.The obvious problem for the Orioles right now is that they are getting zero bang for the buck from the $13 million hole in the rotation. The guy has not seen the pitching mound in two weeks. In other news, the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching staff has had an ERA under 3.00 since that time. Probably just a coincidence.So why would the Padres want to have the maestro of moving parts? By trading back Melvin Upton and his even larger salary for this year and next, they save a few million dollars. They are also seeking a prospect from the O\xe2\x80\x99s.Without the prospect, I\xe2\x80\x99d do this deal every day and three times on Sunday. With a prospect included? Well, it depends who the prospect is, but I\xe2\x80\x99d work hard to make it happen.Joey Rickard is out four to six weeks, and he is the best backup for Adam Jones and his quirky back. The Orioles also lost their only speed threat in Rickard, though Julio Borbon provides that at this point. But Upton can fly, especially by Baltimore standards. He has swiped 20 bases this year (7th best in MLB), whereas the entire Orioles team has only 13!\xc2\xa0 Consider this: there are 19 players in MLB who have more SBs individually than does the O\xe2\x80\x99s team.Upton is currently batting .259 in 91 games with 16 home runs. He does strike out a good bit, but we\xe2\x80\x99re used to that.So where does Hyun Soo Kim fit with this? Probably at DH with Upton in left field and Trumbo in right. Pedro Alvarez would be the one to lose the most.Thinking longer-term, the Orioles are probably not going to be able to afford to keep Trumbo next year, so this covers for a bit of that loss, while also not having to have Jimenez around again.There is more news this morning of a second discussion with the Padres \xe2\x80\xa6Source: #Orioles pursuing #Padres\xe2\x80\x99 Cashner in addition to Upton. Separate deals.\xe2\x80\x94 Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) July 23, 2016So how does this fit with the discussion above? Rosenthal says \xe2\x80\xa6Upton deal with #Orioles would be Upton-for-Ubaldo with #Padres also seeking prospect. SD wants two prospects for Cashner, sources say.\xe2\x80\x94 Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) July 23, 2016Please! NO! No matter how many writers out there say that this is a certain upgrade for the Orioles, the numbers simply do not prove it \xe2\x80\xa6 especially this year. Baltimore needs pitchers who can go deeper into games, right? Well, Andrew Cashner has made 15 starts this year and thrown 73.1 innings \xe2\x80\xa6 less than five innings per start. His ERA is 4.79. Last year it was 4.43.\xc2\xa0 His WHIP number for the two years are 1.425 \xe2\x80\xa6 in San Diego.Indeed, his stats in 2012 and 2013 were very good. If that is the pitcher who would come to Baltimore, then maybe it could be thought about. But for two prospects?

These veteran pitcher \xe2\x80\x9cdeals\xe2\x80\x9d tend to not work out, kill the rotation, and create road blocks for rising prospects to get experience and opportunity. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('MLB trade rumors: Orioles, Padres discussing separate ...', ' The Orioles and the Padres have had their names come up a lot together in the last couple of days. There seems to be a lot to talk about. Along with the late Friday night crazy rumor of a possible Melvin Upton for Ubaldo Jimenez (and a prospect) trade, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are talking about a separate deal for Padres starter Andrew Cashner.    That\xe2\x80\x99s according to Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports, who adds that the Padres want two prospects in return for Cashner. As Cashner has pitched himself to a 4.79 ERA in the NL West this season, you would be hard-pressed to get me to trade two of anything in order to get Cashner. One can hope Dan Duquette has the same feeling. From what Rosenthal also says, the Orioles are not the only team that\xe2\x80\x99s talked to the Padres about these two players. He says that the O\xe2\x80\x99s division rival, the Blue Jays, have also checked in with the Padres about both Upton and Cashner. It appears the Jays don\xe2\x80\x99t want Cashner at San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s asking price. This is the only rational response to that demand. Before the Orioles and Blue Jays names were brought into this, another one of the Upton trade rumors from Friday involved the Padres telling other teams they were close to dealing Upton. Yahoo\xe2\x80\x99s Jeff Passan, who reported that rumor, speculated that could be a negotiating posture, trying to shake out a better bid from a team who\xe2\x80\x99d expressed interest previously.    What\xe2\x80\x99s less clear is whether the Orioles are the team with the current high bid or whether the Orioles are the team being pressured to bid higher than they already have. The idea of Duquette in a bidding war against a competitor might make you nervous. Back in 2014, for instance, the Tigers were also said to have been interested in Andrew Miller, which is what made the Orioles more willing to part with then-prospect Eduardo Rodriguez in that trade.  Imagine the 2014 ALDS with Miller in the Tigers bullpen instead. That series surely doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end in an Orioles sweep and maybe not in an Orioles win at all. Does that mean it was worthwhile? Two years later, that is still a complicated question to try to answer.    Many more teams have been linked to Cashner over the last week than Upton, so Upton to the O\xe2\x80\x99s seems a bit more likely than Cashner, if only because there\xe2\x80\x99s less competition. A lot of teams need a pitcher. The Marlins and Rangers are two other teams who\xe2\x80\x99ve been put in the Cashner discussion in the last few days. There may be more. The Orioles have reclaimed first place for now. They could stand to improve a couple of areas of the club in order to stay there. Maybe that means Upton or Cashner or maybe they will turn to some other selling team\xe2\x80\x99s players. There\xe2\x80\x99s more than week to go until the August 1 deadline. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of time for something to come together. Strap in. It could be a wild ride.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The Baltimore Orioles are winners of four straight and have retaken the lead in the American League East. The Orioles, who host the Colorado Rockies on Monday in the opener of a three-game interleague series, seemed to turn their biggest weakness into a strength as the pitching staff came through over the last four games. Baltimore is last in the AL with 37 quality starts but recorded three of those in the last four contests, the lone exception coming when Dylan Bundy did not allow an earned run in five innings on Friday. The Orioles are 36-14 at home after allowing a total of six runs in a three-game sweep of the AL Central-leading Cleveland Indians over the weekend, capped by Nolan Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s walk-off home run on Sunday. That Baltimore staff will have to deal with streaking rookie shortstop Trevor Story, who piled up four homers and nine RBIs in a three-game sweep of the Atlanta Braves over the weekend and has six blasts in the last seven games to increase his National League-leading total to 27. Story is three home runs shy of tying Nomar Garciaparra for the rookie record of 30 homers by a shortstop. PITCHING MATCHUP: Rockies LH Jorge De La Rosa (6-7, 6.07 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Yovani Gallardo (3-2, 5.69) De La Rosa had a string of five straight quality starts come to an abrupt end when he was crushed in an interleague start against the Tampa Bay Rays on Wednesday. The Mexico native was ripped for nine runs \xe2\x80\x93 seven earned \xe2\x80\x93 on 11 hits and a pair of walks in four innings. De La Rosa fared better in his previous start against AL East competition, limiting the New York Yankees to three hits in five scoreless innings on June 14. Gallardo has gone four consecutive turns without a quality start but at least worked deeper into the game when he served up four runs in seven innings at the Yankees on Wednesday. The fellow Mexican issued 15 walks in 21 innings over those four turns and is allowing opponents a .296 batting average. Gallardo spent his first eight seasons in the NL and never managed to beat Colorado, posting a 0-5 record with a 6.08 ERA in 10 games \xe2\x80\x93 nine starts. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles C Matt Wieters (foot) missed the last six games and is day-to-day. 2.

The heaviest and hottest Orioles rumors so far have been for two San Diego Padres, Melvin Upton Jr. and Andrew Cashner.     Both are flawed and both have their own upside. Remember though, as our fearless leader loves to say, the first rule of baseball rumors is that nothing will probably happen. So, let\xe2\x80\x99s get into me writing thousands of words about moves that probably won\xe2\x80\x99t happen.  Melvin Upton Jr.  Orioles fan know Melvin from back when he went by B.J. Upton. He played on the Tampa Bay Rays for at least parts of eight seasons. He has primarily played left field for the Padres this season. He is a right  handed hitter and will turn 32 years old later this year. He is currently hitting .256/.304/.439 posting a 101 wRC+. He is owed around $7.5 million for the rest of 2016 and will be owed $16.4 million in 2017.  Upton had a bit of resurgence last season at the plate posting a 110 wRC+ for the year. He signed his big contract with the Braves after the 2012 season and was atrocious.     While in Atlanta his plate discipline eroded as did his contact skills and power. He went from an above average major leauger to below replacement level. While in San Diego, his power has reemerged and while he is still struggling to make contact, his power numbers have kept him above water.     Upton can help the current Orioles roster in three ways. First, he is an excellent base runner which the Orioles sorely lack. He has 20 stolen bases which would be seven more than the entire Orioles team. He also is an above average bases runner all around\xe2\x80\x94he has accumulated 4.2 base running runs (you can read more about that here) which would put him second on the team behind of all people Chris Davis (it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about speed). Second, Upton is an above average defender. The Orioles outfield defense is atrocious. It is the 29th ranked outfield defense according to UZR. The easiest way for the Orioles to improve their run prevention would be to improve their outfield defense.     Upton has been an above average left fielder his entire career. His overall defensive numbers are not pretty this season, but that is mostly due to a poor small sample size of 80 innings in center field. He is still an above average defender on the corners. Three, he hits for power and can hit lefties. So far in 2016, his walk rate has fallen to a career low 6.1 percent, not a great sign. However, he has a .183 isolated power number and already has 16 home runs and 11 doubles.  The Orioles have a plethora of low on base/high slugging hitter, but this isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily a bad thing for the offense adding even more fire power to the bottom of the order.     Furthermore, he hits lefties. He has a career 110 wRC+ against left handed pitching and has posted a 146 wRC+ in 2016. The Orioles could use some help against lefties. As a team they have posted a 88 wRC+ against left handed pitching this year which is tied for 25th in the league with the Rockies.  Upton is a flawed, but useful player that \x7fI believe can help the Orioles, the only question after that is what the cost will be to acquire him. The rumored deal is Upton for Ubaldo Jimenez and a \xe2\x80\x9cprospect.\xe2\x80\x9d I love a good \xe2\x80\x9cbad contract swap\xe2\x80\x9d trade.  For the Padres, this saves them some money, gives them a reclamation project they can possibly flip next season, and a lottery ticket.  For the Orioles, it gives them not what they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for\xe2\x80\x94a starting pitcher\xe2\x80\x94but it helps them in areas that can be easily improved. It will cost them about $5 million more over the course of the next season and a half and the \xe2\x80\x9cprospect.\xe2\x80\x9d  The only so called prospect the Orioles should not be giving away is Chance Sisco, otherwise I am not tied to any of them. Maybe Jomar Reyes, but otherwise the whole lot are tradeable assets. Giving up much of value for Upton is foolhardy. He is not a great player, but a useful one. He also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come cheap.     The name being floated is Tanner Scott. A flame throwing lefty reliever just promoted to AA Bowie with severe command and control problems. If the deal was Jimenez and Scott for Upton, I\xe2\x80\x99d do it. Anyone much better then Scott, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to think about it.  Andrew Cashner The other Padre the Orioles have been rumored to be after is Andrew Cashner. He is set to be a free agent, so this would be a rental deal. He is a right handed starting pitcher who has struggled the last two seasons. His ERA currently sits at 4.79 the worst mark since his rookie year.  While he struggled last year results wise pitching to a 4.34 ERA, his peripherals were still alright in 2015. He was essentially a league average pitcher who threw 180 innings, which the Orioles could use. However, in 2016 the peripheral statistics have nose dived as well.  He currently has his highest walk rate since 2012 and the lowest whiff rate of his career. Not to mention that hitters are making contact on his pitches at a career high rate as well even though they are swinging less overall at those pitches.  On top of all that, Cashner has been giving up the gopher ball at a 14.7 percent home run to fly ball rate. The highest rate he has given up home runs at since 2012.    Cashner had good results last in 2013 and 2014 for the Padres. He was able to run a low BABIP and a low HR/FB rate. Whether or not that was due to luck or skill is up to you, but for the last two years and especially in 2016 he has been the same pitcher.  A lot of teams are in on the Cashner sweepstakes at this point. On top of the Orioles, the Giants, Tigers, Rangers, Marlins, and Astros have all been connected to Cashner. The reported asking price from the Orioles is \xe2\x80\x9ctwo prospects.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ah, there are those magical words again. For a half season rental of a soon to be 30 year old right handed pitcher the price cannot be all that high. However, if the Orioles are competing with that many teams, they will quickly be outmatched in terms of buying power.  I am a little hazy on why Cashner is so desirable. His three most predominate traits are that he has an arm attached to his torso, that arm can throw the ball sixty feet six inches, and he is currently breathing. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten good results since 2014 and those results are dubious.  Cashner isn\xe2\x80\x99t even an innings eater as he never thrown above 200 innings in a year and has only gone over 175 innings once. The Orioles could use all the help they could get in the rotation and if the price is low enough then Cashner makes some sense, but I am not convinced he is worth getting into a bidding war over.     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*** The Orioles are in first place and are looking to add, with a weakened farm system they are going to have to get creative. I would bet on the Orioles making at least one trade before the July 31st non-waiver trade deadline and at least one more before the August 31st waiver trade deadline.  Whether or not it is for either of Upton or Cashner remains to be seen. Either way, it\xe2\x80\x99s shaping up to be a fun stretch run in Baltimore.   ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles beat the Rockies 3-2 in the lamest walk-off ever ...', ' In what was a pretty terrible game to watch, the Orioles used a nice start from Yovani Gallardo and a shut-down performance from the bullpen to beat the Rockies 3-2 in extremely lame walk-off fashion at Camden Yards on Monday to extend their current winning streak to five games.    Of course he pitched well Rockies starter, and longtime Orioles trade target, Jorge De La Rosa entered Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game with a 6.07 ERA, 5.22 FIP and -0.3 WAR. The 35-year-old is not a good pitcher. But the Orioles random spurts of offensive ineptitude do not discriminate, so of course De La Rosa shut them down for most of the night They had him on the ropes early on. In the first inning, the Birds loaded the bases with one out thanks to a Jonathan Schoop double, a Nolan Arenado error and a Mark Trumbo walk. But then it was the ice cold Chris Davis who struck out followed by a Matt Wieters ground out. Like that, the threat was over and no runs where scored. In the second inning, the O\xe2\x80\x99s broke through the deadlock, but could have gotten more. J.J. Hardy led off with a walk. A batter later, Dariel Alvarez reached when Arenado airmailed a throw to first base, allowing the runners to move up to second and third. And then Adam Jones put the good guys on the board 1-0 with a single to right field, which drove in Hardy from third. But that was all they would get as Schoop hit into a double play to end the inning.    From there, the Baltimore bats would stay annoyingly quiet until the seventh inning.    You go, Yo! Yovani Gallardo took the hill for the Orioles and did pretty darn well against a Colorado offense that has scored the second most runs in all of baseball. Through the first three innings he allowed only two runners on a single and hit by pitch, but did not give up a run. The fourth inning saw the Rockies tie things up at 1-1 when Arenado atoned for his two errors with a solo home run to left field, but then Gallardo struck out the side.    Double plays in the fifth and sixth inning kept Gallardo out of trouble. It seemed his luck would continue in the seventh inning. Following a walk to Carlos Gonzalez to lead off the frame, he got Trevor Story to fly out and then picked off Gonzalez at first base to clear the bases with two outs. But that is where his fortunate evening ended. David Dahl, making his major league debut, singled up the middle to nab his first career hit in ""the show"". Then he moved to second on a wild pitch, but it was some pretty lazy catching on the part of Wieters, if we\xe2\x80\x99re honest. Not that I am blaming the catcher. We don\xe2\x80\x99t do that around here. Ex-Oriole Mark Reynolds made it hurt when he singled up the middle to drive in Dahl and give the visitors a 2-1 lead. Gallardo exited the game there in favor of Mychal Givens, who would get Daniel Descalso to fly out to finish the seventh. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to be too disappointed with Gallardo\xe2\x80\x99s performance. He went 6.2 innings and allowed two runs on five hits, two walks and six strikeouts. If he could do that every time out, the Orioles will win a lot of games with him on the bump. Unfortunately, the bats were pretty quiet while he was on the mound, but they did enough to ensure he was not saddled with a bad luck loss.    Off the hook De La Rosa finally pitched like his ERA said he should in the bottom of the seventh inning. He bounced a cutter off of Nolan Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s foot and then gave up a double to Dariel Alvarez to give the O\xe2\x80\x99s men on second and third with just one out. That was the end of the southpaw\xe2\x80\x99s night as he was replaced by Adam Ottavino, who would limit the damage. Jones grounded out to shortstop, scoring Reimold and tying things up at two runs apiece. But that was the end of the scoring in ""regulation"" if you will. Yeah, the two teams played the eighth and ninth innings technically, but nothing really happened. As far as the Orioles go, Givens pitched a perfect eighth and Zach Britton looked nasty in the ninth. But, you know, like the good kind of nasty. Anyway... Worst. Walkoff. Ever. Chaz Roe came in to toss the 10th inning and looked OK, I guess. He made it through it. With two outs, Descalso singled and then moved to second base on a passed ball. Again, Wieters could have done a better job moving his feet back there, but the guy is just returning from a foot injury, so we won\xe2\x80\x99t bash him too bad. But Roe got out of the inning with a little help from the home plate umpire, who called strike three on Nick Hundley on a pitch that was a couple inches off the outside of the plate. Thanks, man! In the bottom of the inning, it was Jones again causing issues again with a one-out single. Schoop moved Jones all the way to third with a single of his own into right field. And then Manny Machado doubled off the scoreboard to win the game!!! WOO!......Oh no, wait, that is not what happened at all. That would have been actually cool. What actually occurred: Machado hit a squibber back to the pitcher (Jordan Lyles), who dropped the ball. It looked as if the righty kind of wanted to turn a double play and he kind of wanted to nab Jones at home. After recovering, he still had time to get the ball home, but he threw it slightly low, forcing Hundley to bend down. The catcher got his mitt to it, but then he dropped the ball too. Thanks, timely rain! Jones slid in, scoring the winning run and giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s their fifth consecutive victory. Whatever, a win is a win!    The cherry on top? The Red Sox lost a few minutes after the O\xe2\x80\x99s game concluded, so the Birds now lead the AL East by 2.5 games. Tomorrow Can they make it six in a row? They sure have a good chance with Chris Tillman (14-2, 3.18 ERA) starting. Colorado will send righty Chad Bettis (8-6, 5.31) to the bump. See you at the Yard.

The Orioles won 5-3. Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY SportsPedro Alvarez had two 90-foot trips to first base on Sunday afternoon that were critical to the scoring of three Orioles runs and a 5-3 win and series sweep over the Cleveland Indians.One day after Chris Davis hustled to first base on a double-play ball to get a run scored from third base, Pedro Alvarez did the same. The video replay proving it and overturning the call. It was good to see one of these challenges go the O\xe2\x80\x99s way.Little things make a big difference in the game of baseball, where inches and split seconds can make all of the difference. And it happened a second time later in the game.In the ninth inning, Alvarez struck out on a wild pitch, having also the presence of mind to run to first base. By shear good fortune, the throw from catcher Roberto Perez hit Pedro in the head. We could say he put his head to good use, deflecting the ball. This gave the Orioles an extra out, setting the stage for the Nolan Reimold walk-off homer off Cody Allen.This blog and its writers have been likely the most Reimold supportive of O\xe2\x80\x99s sites. But even we would have to acknowledge he has not played well in recent times. Is this homer enough to save Nolan from future moves, like, oh, what could it be? Like \xe2\x80\xa6 if the Orioles were to obtain the Upton fellow from San Diego, with Hyun Soo Kim returning as well, etc.\xc2\xa0 Reimold has already used up more than nine lives in his career with the Birds, so never count him out.The home run was the first in 56 days for Nolan and the third walk-off shot in his career. He last accomplished this on 8/10/11 against Jason Frasor and the White Sox. Prior to that he hit a game-winning walk-off as the fourth homer of his career on 5/27/09 against Brian Wolfe of the Blue Jays. It was in the bottom of the 11th with the O\xe2\x80\x99s trailing 10-9 and one out. Scoring ahead of him were Melvin Mora and Cesar Izturis (pinch running for Luke Scott).\xc2\xa0 Lots of memories there!Speaking of nine lives and returning from the dead, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day certainly acted like nothing was bothering him in his return after many weeks on the disabled list. He struck out the side in the ninth, improving to 3-1 on the season with the victory and lowering his ERA to a perfect 3.00.\xc2\xa0 Having him back and performing well with good health is definitely the addition of an extra weapon.

OK, yes, the Rangers have the same number of wins, but two more losses.

Could this continue throughout the remainder of the season?It has been largely assumed for some time that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 only chance to make the playoffs, win the division, or compete well into October was dependent upon getting at least one veteran arm for the rotation. But as we have written here on The Baltimore Wire ad infinitum, making this happen successfully is not only expensive long-term, it is fraught with historic disappointment in the product. I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner predict a cheerful, peaceful presidential campaign season than predict success from any pitching acquisition.If the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching staff can continue as they have over the past 12 games (8-4 with a 2.77 ERA), the Birds really don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be making any moves. But that is asking for and hoping for a lot \xe2\x80\xa6 probably too much. We could be happy with a 3.50 ERA, or something like that!The question is essentially whether the staff, particularly the starting rotation, has finally arrived at what we hoped they could be, or whether the previous period of struggle is the real \xe2\x80\x9cthem\xe2\x80\x9d and that this new success is the aberration.To answer the question posed by this piece, yes, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching is capable of continued high-level success. The talent is there, both from the history of veterans and the rising skills of young pitchers. But the devil is always in the details of execution of talent on the field, specifically over that space of 60\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d.It is reasonable to expect Chris Tillman to extend his good season through the end. Kevin Gausman has pitched better than his record, and we can hope he is finally arriving into a regular and dependable piece for every fifth day.Dylan Bundy looks to have \xe2\x80\x9carrived\xe2\x80\x9d also in terms of pitching ability. It was great to see back-to-back wins from Gausman and him \xe2\x80\xa6 been waiting a few years to experience that!\xc2\xa0 The issue, of course, relates to how many innings are safely available in his arm. This is an imprecise science, though I wonder if the physique and strength for which he is renowned might not position him for a higher number than is typically true of TJ-recovering pitchers.The following two pieces are the wild cards for sure: Yovani Gallardo and Vance Worley. Both have the veteran ability to work the edges and pitch out of trouble while minimizing damage. They can both get shelled from time to time as well. Like Miguel Gonzalez before them, they have to be very good at walking a fine line. It would be huge if they could do it.It is not inconceivable that Mike Wright or Tyler Wilson could put together a hot stretch and contribute well. It too would be huge! The more likely of the two is Wilson. After a 5.22 ERA in 13 starts and 16 games over 81 innings with the Orioles, he has been sent down for a sort of \xe2\x80\x9cre-set\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cre-start.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The numbers are too ugly to print, though he reports feeling good, for what that\xe2\x80\x99s worth. But this is the guy who shut out the Red Sox over eight innings on June 16th.Mike Wright has had a strange season. His 2.58 ERA at AAA Norfolk is half of the 5.97 for the Orioles. We know that there is a jump from one level to the other, but not that much of a difference. And his last three starts for Norfolk have him with a combined ERA of 4.58 over 17.2 innings. Yet again, we know that talent is there, but not the consistency.Left out of this discussion so far has been Ubaldo Jimenez. And \xe2\x80\x9cleft out\xe2\x80\x9d is what he needs to continue to be. The Orioles have simply not had need of a mop-up man lately. In the 10 games since the All-Star break, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have only scored 29 runs \xe2\x80\xa6 yes, let that sink in. They have given up 30, so being 6-4 ain\xe2\x80\x99t bad. But there have been no blowout wins or losses, so no need for a \xe2\x80\x9cjust-git-r-done-and-go-home\xe2\x80\x9d pitcher. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve written in the past how I have a car I have nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cUbaldo,\xe2\x80\x9d since it was very expensive and does not work as advertised.All of this discussion so far has been about starting pitchers. What is there to say about the bullpen other than that they have been a great team strength?\xc2\xa0 And now Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day is back. A key element of the pen will be how they handle middle innings, particularly in Bundy starts, along with any others who can\xe2\x80\x99t get through six innings.While we are talking about pitching, let\xe2\x80\x99s weigh in for a moment on the trade of Aroldis Chapman from the Yankees to the Cubs for four prospects. In the short term this is good for the Orioles, who have nine games remaining with the Evil Empire, including six in NY. It is also good that the Nationals did not get him, since the O\xe2\x80\x99s have their four games yet with Washington. From a baseball perspective, it would be better to see Papelbon at the end of a game, though it is never a good thing to see or be around Papelbon in any context. In the longer term, it will be interesting to see what comes of the prospects who now are with the Yankees.

Manny Machado followed with a comebacker to Lyles, who fumbled the ball before throwing home. Catcher Nick Hundley caught the ball near the ground and lost the handle while attempting to tag the sliding Jones.""It doesn\'t matter how you score,"" Jones said. ""As long as you win the game, that\'s all that matters.""Lyles (2-3) was charged with an error.""I made a good pitch to Machado to get a ground ball,"" Lyles said.

He advanced on a wild pitch and scored on a single by Mark Reynolds to give the Rockies a 2-1 lead.One of the most surprising aspects of the game occurred in the field, where Arenado made two errors at third base. The three-time Gold Glove Award winner botched a grounder in the first inning and threw wildly to first base in the second, a mistake that led to an unearned run.Arenado came into the game with just one error in 96 games this season.Seeking his 100th career victory, Colorado lefty Jorge De La Rosa got locked in a duel with Yovani Gallardo and failed to get a decision. Coming off a miserable outing in which he gave up a career-high nine runs to Tampa Bay, De La Rosa allowed two runs, one earned, and four hits in 6 1/3 innings.He entered the seventh with a 2-1 lead but was lifted after hitting a batter and giving up a double. Jones greeted Adam Ottavino with a run-scoring groundout.Gallardo gave up two runs and five hits in 6 2/3 innings.After Jones singled in a second-inning run, Arenado led off the fourth by sending a 1-0 pitch into the left-field seats.

This apparent interest in one-upping the Orioles has extended to the trade market as well, with Fox\xe2\x80\x99s Ken Rosenthal reporting that the Jays and Padres agreed on a deal to send Melvin Upton to Toronto.    The Orioles remained in the mix until near the end of the process. According to Rosenthal, they\xe2\x80\x99re believed to have offered two prospects to the Padres in addition to Ubaldo Jimenez. However, Rosenthal says that the deal broke down over finances. The trade with the Blue Jays involved the Padres sending \xe2\x80\x9ca very substantial sum\xe2\x80\x9d to the Blue Jays, according to Jays writer Shi Davidi of Sportsnet.ca. The Jays sent 19-year-old pitching prospect Hansel Rodriguez, who\xe2\x80\x99s been pitching in Rookie league, to the Padres in the deal. Rodriguez was rated as the Jays 18th best prospect by MLB.com earlier in the season. There was no immediate word on the fate of Gretel.

07/28/2016,"[('Orioles prospects shut out of MLB Pipeline\\u2019s top 100 ...', ' The Orioles farm system is not very good. Just about everyone who isn\xe2\x80\x99t in some way employed by the Orioles agrees with that assessment. The latest example of that comes from the midseason update to MLB.com\xe2\x80\x99s top 100 prospects list, in which the Orioles are completely shut out.    The list reflects how the 2016 draft and the first half of the season\xe2\x80\x99s development (or lack thereof) has changed the stock of various prospects. While this is just one prospect list and prospect lists are an inherently subjective enterprise, it really says something about the O\xe2\x80\x99s system when they are unable to slip a couple of guys even into the bottom of the list.  Other evaluators might put catcher Chance Sisco in there, but even if they did, one guy in the top 100 isn\xe2\x80\x99t so much better for the system. Division rivals have many more.  There are five Yankees prospects and five Red Sox prospects on the top 100. The Rays have four, while the Blue Jays have only two.     The way things stand right now, the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t have impact prospects lined up to help the big league team in the future, nor do they have much in the way of depth to help the team right now if needed.    It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough thing for an organization to do to build for the future at the same time they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to build up the present. So the fact that the Orioles have ended up in this situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t so surprising, nor is it as concerning as it might be, as long as the MLB team keeps winning with some regularity. One reason the farm system is weak right now is that the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to pick until the third round of the 2014 draft due to signing Ubaldo Jimenez and Nelson Cruz as well as trading a pick - and Josh Hader, now the #45 prospect in baseball - to get Bud Norris.     Jimenez is a complicated topic, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that Cruz and Norris were a big part of why the 2014 team was able to do what they did. It\xe2\x80\x99s much better to have had a division champion banner hanging up for the last two years than it is to have a good farm system right now. There are other reasons too, of course. Some of those are questionable moves made to shore up the team, like last year\xe2\x80\x99s trades for Travis Snider and Gerardo Parra, and this year\xe2\x80\x99s signing of Yovani Gallardo. Moves that hurt the farm without helping the MLB team are a problem. Others are just head-scratchers, like why the Orioles keep dumping competitive balance draft picks in stupid salary relief trades, and why they eschew trying to sign top international amateurs.    So that\xe2\x80\x99s why things are the way they are. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s good or bad is something we can and surely will debate as the next couple of Orioles seasons roll along. With that in mind, here are the new top 10 Orioles prospects from MLB Pipeline. Top Ten Orioles Prospects  Cody Sedlock - RHP Chance Sisco - C Hunter Harvey - RHP Jomar Reyes - 3B Trey Mancini - 1B Ryan Mountcastle - SS Matthias Dietz - RHP Keegan Akin - LHP Chris Lee - LHP Tanner Scott - LHP  Someone who is either an optimist by nature or an Orioles employee by paycheck might spin it as a positive that the O\xe2\x80\x99s top draft pick is immediately their top prospect. While that might be true if the O\xe2\x80\x99s had picked, say, in the top 10 of the draft, Sedlock was the 27th pick. He might be better than the existing guys, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything good about the O\xe2\x80\x99s system. Not even the #1 overall pick, Mickey Moniak, became the best prospect in the Phillies system. Nor did Red Sox first rounder Jason Groome, considered a top five prospect in the draft, become the #1 Sox prospect. Groome is only fourth best in that system. A good or even decent farm system would already have a couple of players more advanced than a late-20s pick. The presence of Dietz and Akin on the back end of the top ten says something similar about the system. When you have two second rounders from the current year who\xe2\x80\x99ve already passed your first rounder from the previous year (D.J. Stewart, now #12 in the system) that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t speak very well of the prior top draft choice. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve read this far into an article about Orioles prospects, you probably already know about and have opinions of the holdovers from the top ten. Harvey is out for at least a year after Tommy John surgery. Lee hasn\xe2\x80\x99t pitched since May 23 due to a lat strain. Scott has thrown 101 in relief and may not be able to throw strikes.    Three other 2016 draft picks are among the top 30, making a total of six players drafted this year on the O\xe2\x80\x99s list. The others are third rounder Austin Hays (15), fourth rounder Brenan Hanifee (19) and seventh rounder Preston Palmeiro (21). I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why Palmeiro is ranked that high. Lists get weird sometimes. Putting six draftees right in the top 30 is probably another sign of a system that had been weak. Even the Phillies, picking at the top of every round, only added four players to their top 30 from this year\xe2\x80\x99s draft. That\xe2\x80\x99s also true for the Reds, who picked second. The Braves, who had three of the top 44 picks, added only those three players to their top 30. At the very bottom of the list is a newcomer who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t drafted this year. Alex Wells, a 19-year-old lefty signed out of Australia last year, has made his US debut for Aberdeen this year and has done nicely through seven starts.

They received Melvin Mora and three forgettable players in the trade. I guess that one worked out. Oh, and by the way, exactly one year later, Mora\'s wife gave birth to the quintuplets. Yes - they are 15 years old now. All of you are old, unless someone is reading this who was born in the 21st century. This was also the day of the Bobby Bonilla trade in 1995. The Orioles sent Damon Buford and Alex Ochoa to the Mets in the deal. There are two former Orioles with birthdays today. They are 2001 reliever Chad Paronto, and Bob Milacki (1988-92), who was the starting pitcher in the most recent O\'s no-hitter - the combined no-no on July 13, 1991. Is today your birthday? Happy birthday!

On this day in history... In 1540, Thomas Cromwell was executed for treason by order of King Henry VIII. Also, Henry married his fifth wife, Catherine Howard. In 1794, Maximilien Robespierre and Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, who argued for the execution of French king Louis XVI and presided over the executions of tens of thousands of others, were themselves executed by guillotine. In 1868, the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution - which, generally, guarantees citizenship to every person born in the US, and also incorporates the Bill of Rights onto the States - was certified. In 1948, the London Metropolitan Police Flying Squad stopped a bullion robbery in what was known as the Battle of London Airport.

The Baltimore Orioles lead the American League East but are experiencing a mini-funk as they enter a pivotal three-game divisional showdown with the host Toronto Blue Jays that begins on Friday. The Orioles have lost three consecutive games, including a 6-2 setback against Minnesota on Thursday, and have seen their lead over the Blue Jays dwindle to 1 1/2 games. Baltimore has been outscored 15-6 during its slide and has belted just two home runs \xe2\x80\x94 both by Adam Jones. The Orioles (150) and Blue Jays (144) are the top two home run-hitting teams in the majors and feature five players with more than 20 blasts \xe2\x80\x94 major league-leader Mark Trumbo (30), Chris Davis (22) and Manny Machado (21) for Baltimore and Edwin Encarnacion (27) and Josh Donaldson (25) for Toronto.

The Jays won 9-1. Mandatory Credit: Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are simply playing poorly in all aspects of the game and are frankly not a very good baseball team at this point.The Orioles are also no longer a division leader. After losing to the Blue Jays 9-1 on Saturday, the O\xe2\x80\x99s fall a game behind Toronto, with the Red Sox lingering nearby.From before the beginning of this season, I believed that the Jays were the team to beat in the AL East. That Boston has done so well is not incomprehensible, but neither did it seem probable to me. They have had a surprising number of players perform at a higher-than-expected level.But looking at Toronto, seeing that top five order of Baustista, Donaldson, Encarnacion, Saunders, and Tulowitski \xe2\x80\xa6 that is formidable. And the rest of the lineup is decent.Then looking at the Jays\xe2\x80\x99 starters, between Estrada, Happ, and Sanchez, they have a current combined ERA of 2.97 over 380 innings. Their joint record is 31-8.\xc2\xa0 Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s starting pitching has thrown 658 innings to lead all of MLB. The closest AL team is Cleveland with about 40 fewer innings thrown. The Orioles rank 27th in all of MLB.The one weakness of the Jays is their 10th-ranked bullpen in the American League for ERA, a full run worse than the Orioles. This accounts for some of their less than dominant performance this year, though that might change.Hopefully what will truly change is the way the Orioles are playing baseball. Just as it is difficult to imagine how they can be beaten when they hit four or five homers a game, it is difficult to imagine that they can extricate themselves from these losing streaks and slumps into which they frequently fall.The good news is that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are in a pennant race as August dawns. This was not necessarily a certainty back in March. The national writers could not have imagined it at all, and even in Birdland it seemed perhaps more than could be reasonably hoped for. But this team is full of players with long, historic records of performance far above the current level of play. It is there for the taking; they need to step up.It would appear that the Orioles are going to have to go with what they have for pitching. Jimenez and Gallardo should have never been obtained, but here they are. There is still time for a Wilson or Wright to step up in a big way. But quite a number of pitching \xe2\x80\x9cstep-ups\xe2\x80\x9d need to happen.New acquisition Logan Ondrusek made his Orioles debut and was a bright spot in an otherwise dismal afternoon. The 31-year-old is 6\xe2\x80\x998\xe2\x80\x9d and honestly has a very good pitching history from his past with the Reds. His fastball velocity looks good, though it does not appear to have much movement. The slider was excellent and would look to be his best pitch. This is not a huge acquisition that is a game-changer, but it may prove to be of help over these final two months.But whether the pitching can arrive to something workable or not matters little if the offense cannot rediscover itself. We can quote the comparative numbers to other years, but they probably mean little, given the turnover of personnel.

A good time to begin that would be today, getting a game back on the Jays. To do so, the Orioles will have to find a way to hit off Aaron Sanchez at 11-1 with a 2.72 ERA. Chris Tillman will also need to survive the first couple innings against his historic nemesis and once again be the stopper of a losing streak.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have become a team that both excites their fanbase with winning streaks, yet depresses the same with multiplied losses.What is a fan? The word \xe2\x80\x9cfan\xe2\x80\x9d is short for a \xe2\x80\x9cfanatic\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 someone who is emotionally invested in the team they follow. And that emotional investment in the 2016 Baltimore Orioles is becoming more difficult given the high highs, and the low lows.Every baseball team, even the best in the sport with the best record at the end of the year, is going to have some low times and piled-up losses by the end of the season. It is the nature of the game. A 100-win season is exceptional. St. Louis did it exactly last year. Prior to that it was the 2011 Phillies who won 102 games. The last AL team to do so was the Yankees in 2009. So that is three teams in seven seasons, which is equal to it happening once in 70 chances.A season with 100 wins is a percentage equal to an NFL team going 10-6. Though we would call that a successful football season, it is not exceptional. In some cases it might not even get you into the playoffs.All of this is to say that baseball fans have to put up with more disappointment over the course of a 162-game campaign and six months of mostly daily contests.Of these Orioles I have used the phrase that they have a baseball case of bipolar disorder, featuring big highs and lows. They are manic depressive with multiple personalities. Consider the past 32 games since June 22nd (20% of the season) \xe2\x80\xa6Won seven straight = 7-0Lost five straight = 7-5Won six of seven = 13-6Lost four straight = 13-10Won five straight = 18-10Lost four straight = 18-14The pretty good news is that the wins outnumber the losses and would combine for a pace to post a final record of 91-71.\xc2\xa0 But that sort of team is difficult to follow emotionally. It is sort of like dating a girl who loves you one weekend but seems completely disinterested in being with you on the following date. What is the real deal? What can you bank on?In the most recent loss to the Blue Jays last night by a 6-5 score, the Orioles came within a few feet in the ninth inning of getting a game-tying sixth run on a long J.J. Hardy fly ball. But, like most of July, the O\xe2\x80\x99s came up just short. The Orioles have only scored six runs twice in this month.Kevin Gausman simply had a terrible outing. It was Ubaldo-like in terms of a lack of command of secondary pitches. And the other half of the battery is playing poorly at this juncture, simply not looking at all like the Matt Wieters we know on defense. His throwing error was very costly, balls are getting past him, and offensively there is minimal contribution. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him props for getting angry enough at the umpire to verbalize the frustration, rather than just sitting back passively and taking it.Chris Davis looks just terribly lost, especially swinging over the top of diving pitches toward his back foot. He actually has a legit shot at setting the all-time single season strikeout record of 223, held by Mark Reynolds from 2009 with the Diamondbacks. Davis is on pace right now to register 221. His 208 strikeouts last year rank him as fifth all-time for a season. Exceeding 200 has only ever been done seven times in MLB history, three of them by Reynolds.

The Orioles simply have to win at least one of these next two games in Canada. This is such a good Jays lineup. I look at it and wonder why they are not leading all of baseball in victories, though I suppose it could yet happen. And it could yet happen for the Orioles.The Orioles have exactly 60 games remaining in the regular season.

If they picked Saturday to take a look at Miley, they must have come away impressed. Miley held the Cubs to one run on one hit in seven innings and struck out nine batters in the process. That is a season high in strikeouts. That\xe2\x80\x99s the good news for Miley. The bad news for Miley is that outing lowered his ERA to 4.98. Miley, a 29-year-old left-handed pitcher, is making $6 million this season and is signed for about $9 million for next season. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a $12 million team option for the 2018 season. One thing you can say in Miley\xe2\x80\x99s favor is that he\xe2\x80\x99s at least sort of eating innings, averaging about six innings per game started. The Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t even managing that far too often. If I heard the stat right earlier, they have 49 games where their starting pitcher has gone fewer than five innings, most in MLB. It\xe2\x80\x99s very nearly half of the Orioles games.    Miley has logged at least 193.2 innings in each of the last four seasons. That includes his 2012 rookie season where he only started 29 games, was an All-Star, and placed second in the Rookie of the Year voting. His two best seasons were his first two MLB seasons, when he was working in the Diamondbacks rotation. There are home run problems to consider. Miley has allowed 18 in his 112 innings this season. It\xe2\x80\x99s not very likely that he would come to Camden Yards and have that problem see much improvement. On the other hand, with nearly a 46% ground ball rate, maybe he could make something work out. He is just the sort of crappy lefty who dominates the Orioles. In fact, he did so back on May 17, shutting them out for six innings in a game the Mariners won, 10-0. Maybe the Orioles could make one of those guys work in their favor for once. Probably not.    As Miley is neither a rental nor very expensive (in dollars), this is not the worst name that will come up as connected to the Orioles over the next couple of days. Should they trade for him? I guess that depends on what it costs them in players. Heyman offers no speculation about who the Mariners might want to target from the Orioles. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get your hopes up. Probably nothing will happen, and even if it does, Miley might not actually be good enough to make a difference.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('MLB trade rumors: Orioles get Wade Miley from Mariners for ...', ' The Orioles got their starting pitcher after all, or at least, they got a starting pitcher. MLB Network\xe2\x80\x99s Jon Heyman broke the news on Sunday night that the Orioles have acquired Wade Miley from the Seattle Mariners.    To get Miley, the Orioles are sending Cuban lefty Ariel Miranda to the Mariners, according to Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports. The good news about this trade is that Orioles fans aren\xe2\x80\x99t likely to end up missing Miranda all that much. The 27-year-old lefty appeared briefly for the O\xe2\x80\x99s early this year when they were in their brief desperate \xe2\x80\x9cwe need a fresh long man every game\xe2\x80\x9d period. Other than that, Miranda\xe2\x80\x99s been pitching in Norfolk this year, where he has a 3.93 ERA over 19 starts in which he\xe2\x80\x99s averaged a bit shy of 5.1 innings per start. If the Orioles felt like Miranda was any kind of rotation answer, they could have just called him up instead. A good outcome for Miranda might well be what Miley is already doing.    Not that what Miley has been doing this year is any good. The only reason this trade isn\xe2\x80\x99t completely upsetting is that the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t really trade a prospect, so they haven\xe2\x80\x99t hurt their farm any. Miley has a 4.98 ERA this season, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re more interested in a stat like FIP, well, he\xe2\x80\x99s at 4.75 there. Various writers, including Heyman, have commented that the Orioles \xe2\x80\x9cneed\xe2\x80\x9d a lefty, because they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had one in their rotation all year. They are already well-stocked with near-or-higher-than 5 ERA pitchers, though. They did not need Miley. Maybe he will be good here, or maybe even decent, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t be expecting anything more than more of the same. A potential selling point of the trade is that Miley is also signed for 2017 at about $9 million, with a $12 million option for the 2018 season, if the Orioles want to exercise it. The Orioles might think about that if Miley returns to pitching like he did last year with the Red Sox, when he posted a 4.43 ERA over 32 starts.     That\xe2\x80\x99s not great either but it\xe2\x80\x99s better than giving up a draft pick for whatever mediocre-or-worse free agent starting pitcher is left on the market in mid-February next year.

The Baltimore Orioles won 6-2. Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles registered a high-level win of significance over the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday afternoon by defeating them 6-2 in 12 innings.Yes, a win is a win, whether it is a good team or bottom dweller. But beating the team that just beat you and took first place away from you the day before \xe2\x80\xa6 well, that\xe2\x80\x99s better than a victory over a rebuilding outfit. It is especially nice to do it in their ballpark, hanging around with their best starter, stretching their bullpen to 12 innings, frustrating their offence, and then breaking through at the end.It probably could be said that the Orioles needed this game more than the Blue Jays. It was needed to avoid a sweep and to end a losing streak. The Birds needed to beat Toronto in their ballpark, setting up the remaining six games against these bad birds. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are now 6-7 against the Jays this year, and the next time they will meet at the Rogers Centre will be seasonal games #157 to #159, just before a final three-game set at Yankee Stadium.Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game was honestly one that the Orioles probably should have lost. They were pretty much shut down by Aaron Sanchez over the first six innings. A critical double in the seventh inning that followed a Chris Davis walk would set up runs scoring on a groundout and a sac fly. This would be all that was scored until the 12th inning, as there were not many chances. For the entire game, the Orioles were only 2-for-5 with runners in scoring position. Those two hits were the 12th inning game-winning single of Jonathan Schoop that drove home Pedro Alvarez after his walk and balk to second base, and then the three-run homer that followed later by Adam Jones.Again, major props to the beleaguered and much maligned Orioles pitching staff. Chris Tillman kept the Orioles in the game by only yielding a two-run homer in his 5.2 innings, and then the bullpen combined for 6.1 scoreless innings of giving up only one hit and three walks. Mychal Givens gets the win to improve his record to 8-1 on the season. Only Tillman has more wins.This is a good time for an off day. The Orioles will host the Rangers for three games before heading out immediately again for a 10-game trip against the White Sox, A\xe2\x80\x99s, and Giants. Clearly this trip is going to be critical for the success of the 2016 Orioles.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireNBA Playoffs: Recap, must-see highlights from Wizards vs. Celtics Game 43h agoBaltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters Suits Up for His First Game Against Orioles6h agoBaltimore Orioles Player Profile: Aderlin Rodriguez7h agoBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley1 d agoOn another note, Brian Matusz started a game yesterday for the Cubs and gave up a two-run homer in each of the first three innings, including Nelson Cruz (#26) and Cano.

The two-thirds completed point of the season will be achieved after Friday\xe2\x80\x99s game.As a quick summary of the analysis below, the Orioles have definitely improved a bit in right field, significantly improved in left field, and considerably improved the power production from designated hitter.Here are comparative stats from 2015 / 2016 for these three positions, noting batting average, on-base percentage, and home runs from one year to the next.

Twelve different players spent some time out there, with Gerrado Parra having the most games \xe2\x80\xa6 just 43. Delmon Young had 40 and Chris Davis 30, hitting nine homers in those 30 games. So the position was not a total loss in spite of the revolving door of others who brought down the total numbers. But the RF situation was very unsettled for the entire season.Right Field 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Though the overall average and OBP from right fielders this year is similar to 2015, Mark Trumbo has given it power that was lacking. From this position he has hit 16 while batting .292. (Breaking news, add one more!) \xc2\xa0Joey Rickard has gone .281 in 43 games, with Reimold .279 in 21 games.Left Field 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 These are ugly, ugly numbers.

He has hit .337 in LF.\xc2\xa0 Nolan Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s .212 as the left fielder has not helped. In between is Joey Rickard at .254.\xc2\xa0 None are much of a power threat. Is there anything to be learned or noted from both Rickard and Reimold hitting much better as right fielders?Designated Hitter 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 The only thing keeping these numbers from being rather horrid was Jimmy Paredes catching fire for half a season with a .279 average in 81 games. Beyond that, there is little we would want to remember about designated hitters in 2015.Designated Hitter 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Pedro Alvarez has come on to be the most-used DH for the Orioles, now in 56 games. He has hit .260 and clubbed 15 home runs (Breaking news, add one more). In 42 games at DH has been Mark Trumbo, belting 12 homers and batting .241.\xc2\xa0 Chris Davis has the only other homer from DH, hitting it in one of two games in this role.But what if? \xe2\x80\x93 After the 2014 season, much of the Orioles fanbase was angry that the team did not spend aggressively to maintain Nelson Cruz and Nick Markakis. What would that look like now? We said at the time that this was a theme we were not going to forget and that we would re-visit from time to time. That each did well in 2015 was not shocking news. The concerns (such as they were) that kept the O\xe2\x80\x99s from a more aggressive effort had more to do with the back end of the potential deals rather than the front end.

That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of game that happened to the Orioles on Thursday night and they were on the wrong end of all of the chicanery, losing the finale, 5-3.    If you only look at the box score, you might think that the Orioles trade deadline acquisition, Wade Miley, did not have a very good debut. Certainly, giving up four earned runs on eight hits in five innings of work is not a good game. Surely he could have done better than he did, yet the key scoring plays against him were very heavily influenced by bad batted ball luck. And Mileys to go before I sleep It\xe2\x80\x99s not like Miley was pitching a perfect game before he ran into some bad luck. No. He faced a deficit before the BABIP dragon ever arrived on the field. New Rangers catcher Jonathan Lucroy broke the scoreless tie in the top of the second inning with his first home run as a member of the Rangers. The inning after that saw the Rangers score again. The struggling Delino DeShields led off the inning with a sky-high double that was just too far away from Hyun Soo Kim for Kim to run down. Two consecutive groundouts advanced and then scored DeShields.    While all of this was going on, the Orioles were flailing pathetically against the offerings of Rangers starter A.J. Griffin. Sometimes it seems like anyone who can throw an off-speed pitch in the 60-69mph range is instant kryptonite for the Orioles offense, so as soon as Griffin spun in such slow breakers, there was a feeling of dread there.    Miley at least kept the game fairly close until either fate, luck, the universe, or his teammates let him down, depending on how you care to apportion the blame. The top of the fifth was the bad inning. Elvis Andrus led off the inning with a double, taking that extra base by catching Adam Jones napping a bit in center field. This didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt the O\xe2\x80\x99s any, at least - a failed DeShields bunt right back to Miley led to Andrus being tagged out at third base.    After Shin-Soo Choo singled to put men on first second, Miley got Ian Desmond to hit a ground ball almost right at Chris Davis that should have been an inning-ending double play.  However, the ball rolled towards Davis in such a way that Choo, the runner on first, seemed to screen Davis from seeing the ball and Davis whiffed on his attempt to field the ball. The grounder rolled into right field and scored DeShields, putting the Rangers up 3-0. More bad luck, or bad play, followed: Carlos Beltran flared a ball into the no man\xe2\x80\x99s land between second base and right field. Jonathan Schoop, rushing back to field the ball, sprinted far enough to make a play on the ball, but when Schoop reached out for a basket catch, he missed.     Another run scored on the play and the Orioles were staring at a 4-0 deficit. Miley\xe2\x80\x99s night came to a close after five innings in part because the last play of the top of the fifth was a ground ball off Miley\xe2\x80\x99s foot. He had to limp a bit back to the dugout, though manager Buck Showalter after the game said he expects Miley to make his next start. The boom-or-bust offense when it busts The Orioles followed up that frustrating inning by scoring a couple of runs - making the bad luck or bad defense be all the more frustrating. It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing if you have bad luck when you\xe2\x80\x99re getting shut out. You were going to lose anyway. Once you\xe2\x80\x99re on the board, suddenly the runs already allowed matter even more.  The bottom of the fifth inning opened up with Mark Trumbo and Pedro Alvarez going back-to-back to put the Orioles on the board. What might instead have been a 2-2 tie was a 4-2 hole for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. This was the kind of game that was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 boom-or-bust offense at its finest. There was a lot of bust. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even say that the Orioles blew their scoring chances because they did not have any.     The Orioles had exactly zero at-bats in the entire game with a runner in scoring position. No one who did not hit a home run ever reached second base. That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like Griffin is Cy Young out here. The Rangers, by comparison, had 16 at-bats with runners in scoring position and they capitalized with hits in three of those situations, scoring a run each time. Even when the Orioles did get a runner on base, the runner didn\xe2\x80\x99t tend to last very long. The O\xe2\x80\x99s hitters grounded into three double plays over the course of the game. They left four men on base. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to win many games with so few runners. Hyun Soo Kim made it a 4-3 game with a sixth inning home run, the first that Kim has hit at Camden Yards. Kim also had a single in the game, while Alvarez, who hit his 16th home run earlier in the game, turned in a three hit game. Those guys were the Orioles offense on Thursday night. The home run drought of Davis continues. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t blasted a bomb since before the All-Star break. Things are not faring much better for Matt Wieters, who went 0-4 in the game and only saw seven pitches. Wieters is batting .129 since the beginning of July. Manny Machado, a .209 batter since July 1, is not so much better off. If the Blue Jays beat the Astros later Thursday night, the Orioles and Jays will be tied in the standings, though the O\xe2\x80\x99s will at least hold the edge by percentage points as the Jays are one back in the loss column.    Is Chicago, the land of deep dish pizza and hot dogs with way too much stuff on them, going to be the place to spark some of these slumping hitters? The O\xe2\x80\x99s head there next. I won\xe2\x80\x99t hold my breath. The series-opening game on Friday at 8:10 Eastern will see Yovani Gallardo start for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, with old friend Miguel Gonzalez pitching for the White Sox.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Chicago White Sox right-hander Miguel Gonzalez likely won\xe2\x80\x99t need additional motivation heading into the opener of a three-game series versus the visiting Baltimore Orioles on Friday. After spending his first four seasons with the Orioles, the 32-year-old Gonzalez was released by the club in late March after posting a 1-4 mark with a bloated 9.78 ERA in spring training. The White Sox received a jolt of momentum by snapping Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s eight-game winning streak on Thursday, with Avisail Garcia belting a solo homer in the 6-3 victory over the Tigers for his third blast in as many outings. The 25-year-old Venezuelan has 14 hits in 15 career contests with Baltimore, but is 0-for-5 with three strikeouts against Friday starter Yovani Gallardo. The Orioles, who dropped a 5-3 setback to Texas on Thursday for their sixth loss in nine outings, begin a 10-game road trip looking for better success as they have lost seven of their last nine away from home. Mark Trumbo launched his majors-best 31st homer on Thursday and has a pair of solo shots for his lone two career hits versus Gonzalez. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Yovani Gallardo (3-3, 5.70 ERA) vs. White Sox RH Miguel Gonzalez (2-5, 4.06) Gallardo fell to 0-2 with a 5.63 ERA in his last six outings on Saturday after allowing five runs on as many hits in 4 1/3 innings in a 9-1 setback at Toronto. Control issues have plagued the 30-year-old this season, as Gallardo issued five walks versus the Blue Jays while permitting as many as four on five occasions in his last nine outings. Gallardo has yet to surrender an earned run in both career outings (11 innings) versus the White Sox, but has encountered trouble when facing Todd Frazier (11-for-32). Gonzalez settled for his third straight no-decision and saw his winless streak extend to four contests on Saturday despite yielding one earned run in seven innings at Minnesota. The 32-year-old was in line to pick up the victory versus the Twins before the bullpen let him down. Gonzalez has been consistent throughout July, pitching at least six innings in all six outings. WALK-OFFS 1. Baltimore DH Pedro Alvarez is 11-for-23 with four homers and five RBIs in his last six games. 2. The White Sox have posted a 34-48 mark since splitting a four-game series with the Orioles in April. 3. Baltimore 3B Manny Machado is 3-for-20 in his last five contests.

There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of green grass on a baseball field, and the Rangers batters managed to find a lot of it on a whole variety of swings, good and bad and ugly.There is nothing new about the Baltimore Orioles hitting home runs. They now have 161 for the season, still good enough for best in the American League. But it is not like the Rangers are a doubles hitting outfit. They came into the game with only 163 of them, 13th-ranking in the American League. The Orioles have 189, which is fifth best; and the Red Sox have the most with 242.But six different Rangers players hit a double on this evening, and they were able to plate four of them along with a solo home run for the 5-3 win.Solo home runs by the Orioles were hit by Mark Trumbo, Pedro Alvarez and Hyun Soo Kim to account for all of the Orioles scoring. There really were no other chances to score, as the Birds were 0-for-0 with runners in scoring position. You read that correctly. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever written that before! No Orioles player made it to second base, other than with the three homers.Double play groundouts by Alvarez, Wieters and Schoop quickly evaporated any possibilities of a rally. Texas leads all of baseball with double plays on defense, leading by a large margin. It really is the pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s best friend.So what do we make of the first outing of Wade Miley for the Orioles? Going five innings he gave up four runs on eight hits, zero walks and five strikeouts. Jonathan Lucroy hit a solo home run, but honestly it was off a very good pitch. There were more than a couple of cheap hits, including a pair that scored the third and fourth of the runs. At the same time, his pitches are not extra special. His breaking and off-speed stuff has some nice dive to it. Hopefully he will pitch skillfully and add up the innings over his tenure with the Orioles.

Fortunately it was not an extra-innings game.Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it feel like an easy night when you pound out 16 hits while your starter earns a quality start with just two runs allowed? One would think so. But this was not an evening when it ever felt like the game was in the bag, not even with a 7-2 lead in the eighth inning.With 10 games in 10 days over three cities, it would be great to not have to use a lot of energy and tools for the opening game. Yovani Gallardo had one of those bend but don\xe2\x80\x99t break evenings, scattering seven hits and enjoying some hard-hit balls right at people. At the same time, the Orioles had an uncharacteristic four-error game. Were the seats uncomfortable on the flight to Chicago?Speaking of uncharacteristic, it was such an evening for Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day in yielding three runs with just one-third of an inning to his credit. His ERA went from 2.45 to 3.46 in one evening. That can happen to relievers and skew numbers in a hurry, which is why I like to look at relief statistics by throwing out the two worst games a pitcher has over the season. Everyone has a bad game or two, but if a reliever is consistently good over 90% of the time, that\xe2\x80\x99s a keeper.More from The Baltimore WireNBA Playoffs: Recap, must-see highlights from Wizards vs. Celtics Game 43h agoBaltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters Suits Up for His First Game Against Orioles6h agoBaltimore Orioles Player Profile: Aderlin Rodriguez7h agoBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley1 d agoZach Britton came on for the 48th time this season to record his 34th consecutive save. If you throw out his worst two outings of the season, that would mean he has only allowed one run in 45 innings. It would be a 0.20 ERA. Even so, his actual ERA at this point is 0.58, the best in MLB.Talk is building that Zach is a legit Cy Young candidate. That would be great and he may well deserve it, though I have my doubts that it would go to a relief pitcher. The last reliever was Dennis Eckersley in 1992, so I guess it is possible. For comparison\xe2\x80\x99s sake, he had a 1.91 ERA that year in 69 games with 93 strikeouts in 80 innings, converting 51 of 54 save opportunities. So it looks like Britton has the better ERA so far and will have similar total saves, though Zach would look to likely end with less innings, games and strikeouts. Consider however that the batting average against with Eckersley in 1992 was .191, but for Britton it is currently .138!Next: Improved Orioles Outfield and DH ProductionBut for now, it is great to have the win in the books, especially since Toronto was also victorious.

08/07/2016,"[('Orioles beat White Sox, 10-2; Machado and Bundy have ...', ' It was Bundy Sunday in Chicago for the Orioles, as the youngster faced off against James Shields in the rubber game of the three-game set. Everything you need to know about the weekend matinee below.    The recap The Orioles wasted no time putting runs up on the board against Shields, who struggled with command early. In the top of the first after Hyun-Soo Kim poked a singled into left, Manny Machado took the right-hander deep with a colossal smash to center on a first-pitch fastball. His 23rd of the season put the O\xe2\x80\x99s up 2-0 in a inning where Shields simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t have his best stuff. Ultimately, the biggest storyline of the top of the first might\xe2\x80\x99ve been Shields\xe2\x80\x99 inability to establish any pitch in his arsenal. The Birds worked him for 35 pitches in the frame with plenty of lengthy at-bats.    With an early lead, Dylan Bundy took the hill and worked flawlessly. He made Melky Cabrera look silly on a pair of changeups, while Adam Eaton couldn\xe2\x80\x99t figure out the curveball on 0-1 and 0-2 counts.    Bundy struck out the side with just 12 pitches (nine strikes) in the first \xe2\x80\x94 not a bad way to keep momentum, eh? With one out in the following half-inning, nine-hole hitter J.J. Hardy crushed a baseball over 420 feet to left-center. Shields left a belt-high fastball over the plate, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 wily veteran didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss it.    The worst part for the White Sox? Their starter didn\xe2\x80\x99t ever find his groove. Shields hit Jones and walked Kim in consecutive at-bats, setting up Machado to do his thing... again. #13 lined an unbelievably fast liner into the seats in left field on another first-pitch offering, putting the Orioles up 6-0 with just one out in the second. But, there\xe2\x80\x99s more. In the very next at-bat, Chris Davis smoked what looked to be one of the hardest-hit balls of his season on a hanging curveball. The beautiful swing delivered the fourth home run of the game, tagging Shields for his seventh earned run of the ballgame.    Oh, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t over. Steve Pearce rocketed a liner to left that ended up bouncing into the seats, the sixth hit of the game and ultimately the final straw for Robin Ventura. Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s shot sent Shields for a very early shower and gave Matt Albers a chance to shut down the brutal offensive onslaught. However, the Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly done. Pedro Alvarez greeted Albers with a first-pitch RBI single to center, plating the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 eighth run of the game. That wrapped up Shields\xe2\x80\x99 line: 1.1 IP, 6 H, 8 ER, 2 BB, 4 HR. Albers eventually managed two hard-hit outs to exit the inning, but the damage was done. The Birds were up 8-0 heading into the bottom of the second, essentially letting Dylan Bundy know, ""you don\xe2\x80\x99t need a no-hitter this week, here\xe2\x80\x99s a free win."" And while the eight-run gift was a rather nice one, Bundy didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly need much help on this afternoon. As he continued to shut down Chicago, Machado did the unthinkable in the third.    Against Albers this time in his third plate appearance, Machado threw his bat-head at a pitch down in the zone and didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss. That\xe2\x80\x99s right \xe2\x80\x94 three innings, three at-bats, three HRs. Just a normal seven-RBI day for Mr. Machado. After the third, the score was 10-0 Birds. Sticking with his consistency, Bundy continued to look like a legitimate superstar on the hill. He worked strikeouts with beautiful soft offerings that boosted his the deceptiveness of his mid-upper 90s fastball. And unlike the Shields/Albers duo, he was effective. Utilizing the heater that touched 97 with a filthy upper-70s curveball, Bundy dominated his White Sox opponents like a freight train. His quick pace helped him roll through the first three innings before he met his first jam in the bottom of the fourth. With runners on the corners, Bundy did what every ace must learn to do: minimize damage.    Before allowing the situation to spiral out of control, he hunkered down and fought with impressive resiliency. Just one run ended up scoring on a Todd Frazier sacrifice fly as Bundy stranded the runner on first, capping off the inning with a beautiful strikeout on a curve to Tyler Saladino. The offense settled down over the course of the next few innings, but Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s dominance didn\xe2\x80\x99t slow down. As he\xe2\x80\x99s shown in his 2016 starts, this guy is ready for the main stage. He finished the day with six full innings of work, heavily relying upon a change of speeds to capture his win. Most notably, the mix of offerings was beneficial to his K/BB ratio \xe2\x80\x94 he fanned nine batters while walking just one. It\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say Buck Showalter would take that performance any day of the week. In a slight notch of irony, Ubaldo Jimenez, who has been famously bumped from the rotation, entered to take the mound in the 7th. And he ended up doing what he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to do in the first half of the season: get outs.    He worked a three-up, three-down inning that included a strikeout on a pretty breaking ball, sending the ballgame to the eighth with a 10-2 lead. And while the Chicago bullpen kept the Birds off the board, Showalter sent Jimenez out for some more work in the eighth. He retired three more with ease, earning the ninth inning job as well. After impressively working three more quick ones, Jimenez ended up throwing three perfect innings with three strikeouts on just 26 pitches ... maybe it was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 perfect day. The bullpen was kept fresh, the lineup padded some stats and the Orioles ended up in the win column. It\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that it was a fairly perfect Sunday afternoon for the Birds of Baltimore.    Other things to note  Steve Pearce left the game with some type of arm injury after a throw from the outfield; he was replaced by Nolan Reimold in the fifth inning. Hyun-Soo Kim reached base three times in the game \xe2\x80\x94 he walked twice in addition to his single. The lineup as a whole worked nine walks to pair with their 12 hits.

The Baltimore Orioles moved back into sole possession of first place in the American League East with a strong start to their 10-game road trip and have won five of seven. The Orioles will head further west when they visit the Oakland Athletics in the opener of a four-game series on Monday. Manny Machado became the second player in history to homer in each of the first three innings when Baltimore dominated the rubber match with a 10-2 win at the Chicago White Sox on Sunday. Machado drove in a career-high seven runs in the win and finished up the weekend 7-for-15 with nine RBIs and five runs scored to lead the Orioles offense. The Athletics are stumbling along in last place in the AL West and totaled three runs while being swept at home in a three-game series by the Chicago Cubs over the weekend. Oakland has dropped eight of its last nine games and lost its ace on Sunday when right-hander Sonny Gray was placed on the disabled list with a forearm strain. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (3-8, 4.08 ERA) vs. Athletics RH Kendall Graveman (7-7, 4.46) Gausman bounced back from a terrible start in a loss at Toronto on July 29 by holding Texas to two runs in seven innings while striking out seven in a win on Wednesday. The LSU product yielded one home run in that win and has had some trouble keeping the ball in the park with 20 homers allowed in 110 1/3 total innings. Gausman is still looking for his first road win of 2016 and is 0-7 with a 5.62 ERA in 11 starts away from home. Graveman had a string of five straight quality starts come to an end when he was knocked around for six runs on nine hits \xe2\x80\x93 two homers \xe2\x80\x93 in four innings at the Los Angeles Angels on Wednesday. The 25-year-old escaped without a decision in that contest but suffered the loss at Cleveland on July 29 \xe2\x80\x93 his first since May 19. Graveman has never had much success against the Orioles and was ripped for six runs on five hits \xe2\x80\x93 four home runs \xe2\x80\x93 in 2 2/3 innings at Baltimore on May 8. WALK-OFFS 1.

A number of those stars will wink out after the 2016 season. O\xe2\x80\x99s fans will have to find some new players to receive their ire for years to come.    Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s announcement by the Yankees of the upcoming release of Alex Rodriguez is only the latest example of one of those stars fading from the sky. The season-long retirement tour of Boston\xe2\x80\x99s David Ortiz has gotten a ton of press as well, and let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget the more recent news of a pending retirement for Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira. Two of those three guys have been around in the division for more than a decade. Hardly anybody among baseball fans likes Rodriguez, mostly because of stuff like this. The Vandal, David Ortiz, petulant whiner that he is, once destroyed a dugout phone at Camden Yards and suffered almost no punishment whatsoever because he is the Teflon of MLB. Nothing sticks. Teixeira is not even worth the trouble of booing for any other fanbase, but, since he\xe2\x80\x99s from Maryland and he signed a big contract with the Yankees, he gets mercilessly booed. This has been the case every game since his first as a Yankee, the Opening Day game in 2009.    If one wanted to be rational about it, there\xe2\x80\x99s no real reason to hold a grudge with Teixeira over that whole thing. The Orioles supposedly offered \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d $140 million, so of course he went to the Yankees for another year and $40 million more.     It\xe2\x80\x99s not like it would have been a good idea to blow that much money on Teixeira at that point in time, anyway. Imagine if the 2009 Orioles improved just enough that they were still very bad, but not so bad that they would have been able to draft Manny Machado in 2010. That would have been a disaster. But he spurned his home state for the Yankees, so the boos have never faded. When these three guys are gone at the end of the year, who will be left for Orioles fans to dislike with such a fiery intensity?    For the most part, it takes some familiarity to breed such contempt. Players outside of the O\xe2\x80\x99s division just aren\xe2\x80\x99t seen enough to build a specific grudge against them. Sure, Bryce Harper has an idiotic-looking haircut and said some dumb stuff about Camden Yards that one time.  Yet as things stand with the current schedule, Harper and the rest of the Walgreens corporate baseball team only show up in Baltimore for two games a year. This sort of thing mostly rules out any non-AL East team, although of course, the lucky fluke Royals, enablers of Yordano Ventura intentionally hitting batters in retaliation, are plenty annoying. Even the Royals, who sliced the Orioles to death with papercuts in the 2014 ALCS, don\xe2\x80\x99t really have any one player good enough to be worth hating year after year, and unless a playoff rematch is coming, there won\xe2\x80\x99t be many opportunities to build up that kind of bad blood. So that leaves the AL East opponents.    New York Yankees The great villain of my adolescence, Derek Jeter, has now been gone for two years. When Teixeira and A-Rod are gone, will there even be any Yankees left who are worth hating? Brian McCann had his whole fun police thing in Atlanta, but that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been directed at the Orioles so much. Brett Gardner has been around for a while, yet does he rise to the grudge level? Same with Jacoby Ellsbury, who, going from the Red Sox to the Yankees, would seem to be a prime candidate for dislike, but come on. Also, these guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t still good. They\xe2\x80\x99re not worth hating any more. The Yankees as an institution are and will remain hated by all civilized beings in the universe. Until they\xe2\x80\x99re good again, specific players may well be spared our ire. Boston Red Sox No one should go around punching other people in the face. Dustin Pedroia has the kind of face who makes you give some thought to punching other people in the face, though. He\xe2\x80\x99s annoying, gets more attention than he deserves because he plays in Boston, and has been kinda good for a while... but is he really grudge-worthy? Ortiz has been sucking up all of that oxygen for quite some time. And while the various young Red Sox players, like Jackie Bradley Jr., Xander Bogaerts, and Mookie Betts, are good and will be annoying for years to come, there\xe2\x80\x99s no specific reason to boo any of them, yet.    The greasemaster, Clay Buchholz, is about to be a free agent and probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be around to hate any longer, either. Tampa Bay Rays LOL Toronto Blue Jays Now we\xe2\x80\x99re getting somewhere. Screw these guys, right? There\xe2\x80\x99s Jose Bautista, who, speaking of people you want to punch in the face, actually got punched in the face. He is an irritating prancing peacock and he seems like he is incapable of experiencing joy. Remember that time he tried to throw out Delmon Young on a single to right field and hurt his shoulder? Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget about Edwin Encarnacion and his ridiculous invisible parrot home run trot, either. I do not like either one of those guys... and yet, even then, both of them are free agents after this season. They might not stick around to be regularly booed by Orioles fans. Ahh, but a new challenger arises. Also on the Blue Jays is Josh Donaldson, the reigning AL MVP. Donaldson was traded to Toronto with some existing baggage with Orioles fans, having been involved in the play that led to Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s bat throwing incident. Did Machado wildly overreact to the fact that Donaldson tagged him on that particular occasion? Of course he did. This is not the time for rationality, though. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how this works. This is about having a guy to boo forever and ever, amen.    Donaldson would be annoying enough just by virtue of Oakland gifting him to the Jays just in time for him to win the MVP award. He\xe2\x80\x99d be more annoying still because of Jays fans chanting \xe2\x80\x9cMVP!\xe2\x80\x9d at him even though he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually the best AL player last year. Also, he has stupid hair. My mom thought this haircut would look cool on me in 1990. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t look cool on me then and it looks even worse on Donaldson in 2016. I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve found a winner. Unless something happens to change it between now and then, Donaldson will be Birdland Enemy #1 starting in the 2017 season.

The Tides got on the board in the first inning with a solo shot by Trey Mancini, who also doubled home a run in the sixth.    Michael Almanzar added a solo homer of his own in the seventh, and Corban Joseph tacked on the final insurance run with an RBI single in the eighth. Mancini, Joseph and Dariel Alvarez (2-4, 2B) combined for six of Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s nine hits. Bowie Baysox 6, Richmond Flying Squirrels (SF) 4 Richmond took a quick 2-0 lead in the first inning off of Bowie starter John Means, but Means was able to settle down and get through five innings with a total of three runs allowed. The Baysox took the lead back for good in the fourth, when a two-run single by Drew Dosch capped off a four-run inning. A Chris O\xe2\x80\x99Brien homer in the sixth and a Joey Terdoslavich RBI double in the eighth extended the lead to 6-3.    Jesus Liranzo pitched two perfect innings in relief of Means, and Donnie Hart was able to secure the save despite allowing a solo home run in the ninth.    Frederick Keys 5, Winston-Salem Dash (CHW) 2 The Keys were down 2-0 heading into the top of the fifth, but that changed quickly when the offense went nuts and chased Winston-Salem starter Zach Thompson from the game. Frederick led off the inning with four straight singles followed by a two-run double from Cameron Kneeland.  By the time the dust settled on the top of the fifth, the score was 5-2. That would end up being the final score thanks to some good relief pitching, include two shutout innings from Garrett Cortright.     Starter Franderlin Romero has struggled to an ERA over six since being acquired from the Reds in May, but he was solid in this one. He ended up lasting five innings, with five strikeouts and just the two runs allowed. In other news, D.J. Stewart went 3-5 and is now hitting .280/.391/.430 in 31 games since his promotion. His numbers weren\xe2\x80\x99t pretty in Delmarva, but it\xe2\x80\x99s starting to look like bumping him up to Frederick was the right call. West Virginia Power (PIT) 12, Delmarva Shorebirds 7 Jhon Peluffo tore up the rookie league in the first half, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been a rough transition to A-ball for the 19-year-old from Colombia. In his second Delmarva start, Peluffo was chased in the fifth after allowing eight runs on eight hits and two walks. Only three of those runs were earned thanks to three errors from the Shorebirds\xe2\x80\x99 defense, but Peluffo\xe2\x80\x99s ERA is still sitting at 10.80 after two outings.    Dariel Delgado replaced Peluffo and didn\xe2\x80\x99t fare any better - he allowed five runs in just an inning of work. That was too much of a hole for the Delmarva offense, who managed to make the result look at least a little respectable. Randolph Gassaway and Stuart Levy each hit solo home runs, and Gassaway added two more RBIs with a single in the fifth. Nataneal Delgado was 2-4 with a run scored, and Ryan Mountcastle was 1-5 with 2 RBI.  Connecticut Tigers (DET) 2, Aberdeen Ironbirds 1 (Game 1, 7 innings) Alex Wells got the start for the Ironbirds but had to leave the game after just one batter when he was hit by a line drive up the middle. ReportsXavier Borde replaced him and allowed back-to-back doubles to give Connecticut a quick two-run lead. Borde settled down after that, and ended up pitching three innings with five strikeouts and no further runs. Max Knutson finished out the game and was terrific, with four K\xe2\x80\x99s and just one hit over three innings of his own. Those two first-inning runs were all the Tigers needed. Cole Billingsley cut the lead in half with an RBI single in the seventh, but ended up stranded at second as an Alejandro Juvier flyout ended the ballgame.    Aberdeen Ironbirds 3, Connecticut Tigers 0 (Game 2, 7 innings) Keegan Akin started game two and continued to impress by throwing three one-hit innings, although he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any strikeouts. Steven Klimek matched Akin with three one-hit innings of relief. Aberdeen wasted no time getting on the board in the first inning, when Ronarsy Ledesma doubled home Ryan McKenna and Guillermo Salas. The Ironbirds went quietly the next few innings, until Jaylon Ferguson picked up an RBI double in the sixth. Those were the only two extra-base hits in the game for Aberdeen.

Mandatory Credit: Dennis Wierzbicki-USA TODAY SportsAs the Baltimore Orioles are now into the final third of the 2016 season, who are the offensive players on this team who have historically performed the best in the months of August and September?The O\xe2\x80\x99s are going to need a lot of clutch performances and players at the top of their game through the end of the regular season if they are to hold off the Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox. Baltimore probably has the arguably most difficult schedule of the three teams. The Birds are going to have to earn it. Who can they most count upon?Many factors go into why players perform better from year to year, or from one part of a season as compared to another. But there is something to be said positively for a baseball player who fairly regularly puts up good numbers at the most critical time of the season.So let\xe2\x80\x99s divide the career statistics of Orioles players by the first four months of a season (April thru July) and the last two months of the season (August and September). We\xe2\x80\x99ll include the few games of either March or October with the nearby month, thus giving us a rather definitive first two-thirds of seasons versus final one-thirds. We\xe2\x80\x99ll look at batting averages for each division, as well as home run frequency of plate appearances per homer hit. And the final column will highlight each player\xe2\x80\x99s historically best month of the year over his career.Ranking the current Orioles, here we go from best to worst \xe2\x80\xa6NameAvg 1-4Avg 5-6PA/HR 1-4PA/HR 56Best MonthDavis.243.26617.617.4SeptemberWieters.251.26532.426.5SeptemberReimold.249.26625.431.6SeptemberHardy.254.26833.029.8MayAlvarez.233.24920.320.8JuneFlaherty.212.22742.322.7JuneJoseph.217.22149.424.7AugustMachado.290.27726.226.6JuneSchoop.255.25326.224.8JuneJones.284.26124.828.3JunePearce.267.23829.227.6MayTrumbo.260.23918.323.4April\xc2\xa0With this being the first year for Hyun Soo Kim, he does not have late-season statistics yet. I was unable to find splits for his KBO years, but I think we can surmise that he was a rather consistent hitter throughout seasons.So what we can take from these numbers? It is not terribly encouraging. I did not enter this exercise with the thought that it would be surprisingly good, but it is worse than I imagined.The stats would seem to indicate that Chris Davis has to come alive. And it is surprising to see Matt Wieters and Nolan Reimold near the top. One would presume the wear and tear of catching would cause Wieters to wear down over the course of a season. We remember the good start Reimold had a few years ago before the serious injury took him out.The bulk of the Orioles lineup is rather consistent overall, including players like J.J. Hardy and Jonathan Schoop. Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s numbers are lower for the final third by a slight amount, though he may have made up for all of this over just the past couple of games!And finally, it is no surprise at all to see that Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 numbers are quite lower in the final third of a season. We have seen him wear down over the past couple of years as the season wore on. And more than a few folks have noticed the severe splits disparity for Mark Trumbo from early season to late season.None of this is encouraging for a team that has over the past number of weeks often had trouble scoring, like last evening again for example \xe2\x80\xa6 failing once more to give Kevin Gausman sufficient run support in a 3-2 loss to Oakland.

I hope you didn't stay up late to watch the pathetic Orioles offense show up in Oakland last night. Why do they get only one run in seven innings against a mediocre pitcher like Kendall Graveman? That's the mystery. Maybe they were jet lagged. That would be an excuse that makes sense even if it doesn't make the loss feel much better. Hopefully it won't carry on another night.    If you missed the game, you can\xc2\xa0check out my recap of the not-so-lovely totals. Naturally, since the Orioles lost, the Blue Jays won, so it's a tie atop the AL East again. Well, the Orioles lead by .002 at this exact moment, but they're tied as far as games over .500. Don't count on the Rays to provide any help in beating the Jays over the next couple of days. The Orioles are going to have to solve their road woes and drop some runs on a bad Athletics team that traded away two of its only good players. The Orioles are a good team, maybe a great team, but they sure aren't good on the road. They're now just 24-31 away from Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Whether they make it into the playoffs or not, that's a number that's going to need to improve if they want to really have hopes of going far this season.

(AP) \xe2\x80\x94 It took about four months, along with injuries to some key starters, for Kendall Graveman to evolve from a pitcher at the back end of the Athletics\' rotation to the anchor of manager Bob Melvin\'s staff.He certainly looked the part against one of the best-hitting teams in baseball, relying heavily on a nasty sinker and an even more effective cut fastball.Graveman pitched seven strong innings, Billy Butler hit a tiebreaking single in the sixth and Oakland beat Baltimore 3-2 on Monday night despite another home run from Orioles slugger Manny Machado.""He was kind of splitting the plate with the sinker and cutter today,"" Melvin said. ""When he has both those working, he can use both sides of the plate and it can be effective against any team.""Stephen Vogt homered, scored twice and had two RBIs for the A\'s. Butler added two hits.Machado, who homered in his first three at-bats Sunday, belted his 26th of the season off A\'s reliever Ryan Dull with two outs in the eighth.It wasn\'t enough to prevent the Orioles from falling into a first-place tie with Toronto in the AL East.

""I thought that really got hitters off and it kind of got us some early strikes.""Dull retired three batters and Ryan Madson worked the ninth for his 23rd save.Gausman pitched well but is winless in 12 road starts this season.

Former Atlanta Falcons safety Brian Jordan played minor league baseball on a part-time basis during his three years in the NFL before turning full-time to baseball in 1992, when he started a 15-year major league career.Tebow, 28, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played competitive baseball since batting .494 as a junior in high school in 2004. He then went on to win a Heisman Trophy and two national titles as the University of Florida before a brief pro career as a quarterback and a more enduring stint as a TV personality/Internet person of interest.""Good luck,"" Cleveland Indians designated hitter Mike Napoli said Tuesday when informed of Tebow\'s career move. ""The game will tell you.""He\xe2\x80\x99s certainly an elite athlete, even if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t throw with the accuracy required of an NFL quarterback. That said, just what do we know about Tebow the Baseball Player, and could this actually work?First, the measurablesTebow\xe2\x80\x99s 40-yard dash time is a reported 4.71 seconds, which translates to a 7.07 60-yard dash, the preferred measure for baseball scouts. A 7.0 60 time translates to a score of roughly 50 on baseball\xe2\x80\x99s 20-80 scouting scale.In short, Tebow is considered an average runner.At 6-4 and 230 pounds, Tebow was on the large side for an NFL QB, and he\xe2\x80\x99s now tipping the scales at 255 pounds. He\xe2\x80\x99d be a hulk on the diamond \xe2\x80\x93 Baltimore Orioles slugger Chris Davis stands 6-3, 230, and Chicago Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo is listed at 6-3, 240.Tebow\xe2\x80\x99s camp will market him as a corner outfielder, which is wise: It\xe2\x80\x99s doubtful he\xe2\x80\x99d hit for enough power after a decade away from the game to justify holding down even a reserve role at first base.He\xe2\x80\x99d cut an imposing figure in the outfield, too, considering some of his big league contemporaries: Orioles slugger Mark Trumbo stands 6-4, 225, New York Mets outfielder Jay Bruce is 6-3, 225. Want to envision Tebow on a baseball field? Maybe take a look at Toronto Blue Jays left fielder Michael Saunders, who stands 6-4, 225, has decent speed and this year has hit a career-best 19 home runs.     .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; }     p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } THE BIG LEADVIDEO: Tim Tebow, Sweaty in a Tank Top, Taking Cuts in a Batting CageDangerous curves ahead?Now, take those physical comps and toss them.

I truly believe Tim has the skill set and potential to achieve his goal of playing in the Major Leagues, and based on what I have seen over the past two months, it could happen relatively quickly.""And it will need to happen quickly.Minor mattersTebow turns 29 on Sunday, not too old for a re-purposed quarterback like Weinke just coming out of college, but very old for a just-starting-out baseball prospect.Any team that signs him probably sends him to the instructional leagues this fall. In a best case scenario, by the end of spring training 2017 he\xe2\x80\x99d show he\xe2\x80\x99s up to speed on this baseball thing and avoid stints in extended spring training and the Arizona or Gulf Coast rookie leagues.Remember Michael Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s minor league dalliance? He started at Class AA at age 31. Tebow\xe2\x80\x99s organization would want to see him soon at least at the high-A level, and even then he\xe2\x80\x99d be competing against players nearly a decade younger than him. He\xe2\x80\x99d need to reach Class AA or higher by season\xe2\x80\x99s end, at which point he\xe2\x80\x99d be a 30-year-old minor league outfielder.Should Tebow sign with an East Coast team, the majority of his minor league stops would take him right through the heart of SEC country, where the former Florida Gator would surely draw overflow crowds of supporters, haters and curious onlookers.Speaking of haters...Is there any downside to all this?Not really. Much was made of Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s 1994 trip through the minor leagues \xe2\x80\x9ctaking an opportunity away\xe2\x80\x9d from another minor leaguer. So long as Tebow doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sign a major league contract, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be added to a club\xe2\x80\x99s 40-man roster.Other than the attention his presence would garner, Tebow would merely be another player scuffling through instructional/winter leagues and minor league spring training, and one with some elite athletic skills.Ultimately, a team that signs Tebow would determine how much attention it hopes to derive from him. An invitation to major league spring training would invite a media circus into the normally tranquil early days of camp, before he\xe2\x80\x99d presumably sent to the minor league side.     .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; }     p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYAs MLB stars exit, Bryce Harper, Mike Trout & Co. battle for star powerOf course, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the worst thing in the world. With baseball aiming for crossover appeal in a media environment where attention is fleeting, a dose of Tebowmania amid February\'s slow news cycle\xc2\xa0wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the worst thing. And should Tebow somehow make the major leagues, his presence wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt the sport trying to lure elite athletes away from football and basketball.What now?So where\xe2\x80\x99s Tebow on Sept. 3 \xe2\x80\x93 maximizing his route efficiency under a scalding Florida sun, or well-coiffed on the set of SEC Nation in College Station for UCLA-Texas A&M?We\xe2\x80\x99ll find out soon. His upcoming open tryout will surely draw at least an area scout from many \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps all - major league clubs. It seems unlikely he\xe2\x80\x99ll show enough with the bat to make the distractions \xe2\x80\x93 and there will be some \xe2\x80\x93 worthwhile.We also know it\xe2\x80\x99s never too wise to count Tebow out of anything.GALLERY: TWO-SPORT PLAYERS WHO PLAYED IN NFL and MLBFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInTwo-sport stars who played in NFL and MLB\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

08/10/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The rebirth of Dylan Bundy - Birds Watcher', ""The long awaited arrival of rookie pitcher Dylan Bundy becoming a consistent member of the Orioles starting rotation is finally becoming a reality for Orioles fans. \xc2\xa0The Dylan Bundy era began when the Baltimore Orioles drafted the right-handed pitcher with the fourth overall pick of the 2011 MLB draft. At the time he was selected, Bundy was just an 18-year-old high school baseball player for Owasso HS in Owasso, Oklahoma. The Oklahoma high school standout was 11-0 in 71 innings pitched with a 0.30 ERA and 158 strikeouts his senior year for the Owasso Rams.Coming out of high school, Bundy was praised for his curveball and cutter along with his extraordinary body control that allowed him to maintain a 98 mph fastball late into games. After being selected fourth overall in the 2011 First-Year Player Draft in June, the Orioles made it official by signing Bundy to a Major League contract which was a five-year deal, including a $4 million signing bonus. Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s bonus was the second highest in Orioles history, coming up short to the $6 million signing bonus to Orioles catcher Matt Wieters.On March 11, 2012, the Baltimore Orioles optioned Bundy to the Delmarva Shorebirds, the Orioles Class A Minor League Baseball affiliate team. Bundy pitched 30 innings, giving up zero earned runs, and 40 strikeouts for the Shorebirds. The Orioles quickly promoted to the Frederick Keys, a Class A Advanced Affiliate team for the Baltimore Orioles. With the Keys, Bundy started 12 games with a 6-3 record and a 2.84 ERA. Finally, after a short stint with the Bowie Baysox\xe2\x80\x99s, Bundy joined the Orioles in September of 2012, pitching just 1.2 innings.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley The Baltimore WireCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireAfter making it to the majors in 2012, the Orioles had plans for Bundy to contribute to the team in 2013, but those plans were destroyed as the 20-year-old experienced arm soreness throughout spring training. After an MRI revealed no damage in Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s right elbow and undergoing treatment in April, Bundy resumed baseball activities in June. Bundy immediately felt distressed in his elbow after throwing from 120 feet. Bundy then underwent a second MRI which revealed a small tear in his elbow after attempting to resume baseball activities. According to ESPN, after being examined by team orthopedist Dr. John Wilckens and Dr. James Andrews, it was decided, Bundy would need Tommy John surgery on his injured right elbow. \xc2\xa0After surgery, Bundy slowly returned in the second half of the 2014 season and threw just 22 innings over eight starts in 2015, posting a 3.68 ERA with 25 strikeouts before a strained shoulder once again sidelined him for the season. However, after another setback in 2015, Bundy found himself in the bullpen for the Baltimore Orioles to start the 2016 season. Bundy pitched well in April, providing Orioles fans with a sigh of relief as he pitched nine innings out of the bullpen with a 2.00 ERA. After an impressive April, Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s ERA for May was 6.75 in 12 innings pitched and allowed at least an earned run in five of his eight relief appearances.More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerWith an unstable starting rotation and ranking near the bottom in the majors in team ERA, the Orioles organization announced Bundy would make his first career start against the Tampa Bay Rays following the All-Star break. However, Bundy struggled by allowing three home runs in just 3.1 innings pitched and eventually departed the game after reaching his pitch limit of 70 in a 5-2 loss at Tropicana Field. His fastball reached the mid-nineties, but Bundy showed fatigue which resulted in a dip in velocity. Despite the loss, it was an inspiring moment for the Orioles organization given the long road Bundy took to become a member of the Orioles pitching rotation.Bundy made his second career start against the Cleveland Indians and was fantastic. Unlike his first start, Bundy displayed no signs of fatigue. In a win against the Cleveland Indians, Bundy tossed 87 pitches in five innings, not allowing an earned run with five strikeouts to capture his first career win as a starting pitcher. Bundy went on to bring a no-hitter into the sixth innings in back to back games against the Colorado Rockies and American League-leading Texas Rangers. He followed that up with two wins in 13 innings pitched and struck out 16 batters in his last two starts. As a starting pitcher this season, the blossoming right-hander is 3-2 with a 3.00 ERA and 33 strikeouts in 27 innings pitched. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles having their aggression used against themThe Orioles initial plan coming into the season was to have Bundy pitch out of the bullpen for the entire 2016 season, allowing him to receive a full healthy season under his belt before entering the starting rotation. Fast forward to the post all-star break and Bundy now finds himself as an essential piece to the Baltimore Orioles starting rotation. In the past several weeks, Bundy has revealed the rare talent that everyone was expecting when the Orioles selected him fourth overall in the 2011 draft. From the bullpen to arguably the top starter in the Orioles rotation, Bundy may be the difference maker in the ever so close American League East Division race.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles at Oakland Athletics - usatoday.com', ""OAKLAND  Calif. -- Rookie right-hander Zach Neal allowed one run over 5 1/3 innings in his second career major league start  and the Oakland A's defeated the Baltimore Orioles 2-1 Tuesday night at the Oakland Coliseum.

08/11/2016,"[('Orioles offense gets worse than it already was in 1-0 loss ...', ' Just when you think you\xe2\x80\x99ve surely seen the worst possible Orioles offensive performance you could possibly see, they show up in another game to prove you wrong. The Orioles dredged up the harbor once again to allow access to their increasingly large fail boat.    The game the Orioles turned in against the Athletics, which they lost, 1-0, was nothing short of pathetic. That\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest story in a game where Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s starter, Ross Detwiler, who last won a game as an MLB starter in 2013, was allowed to go eight shutout innings. He had never, in a career spanning 76 starts, gone eight innings - until tonight. Why are they so bad right now? Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s just an anomaly, or something they\xe2\x80\x99re having a harder time getting out of because they\xe2\x80\x99re out on the west coast. Whatever it is, they better figure it out in a hurry, because they\xe2\x80\x99ve now lost first place to the Toronto Blue Jays and they will fall farther if they don\xe2\x80\x99t start scoring runs. What makes this game even worse is that, by getting only six hits and no walks against Detwiler, the Orioles spoiled a rare good game from Yovani Gallardo. The guy gave up only a run over six innings, which is very good for him.     The A\xe2\x80\x99s only picked up four hits and two walks against Gallardo, and they only had two at-bats with a runner in scoring position for the whole game, but that was all they needed. With two outs in the third inning, Gallardo gave up back-to-back doubles hit by Marcus Semien and Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law. That crossed the lone run of the game.    As it ended up, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had more chances in the game than the Athletics. They went 1-5 with RISP and even that one hit did not score a run. The O\xe2\x80\x99s best, and really only, scoring chance came in the first inning. Adam Jones led off the game with a single and ended up on second base for J.J. Hardy. As Hardy has done a lot lately, he lifted a ball to right field and doubled.    You might ask, how in the world does a guy not score from second base when the batter doubles. That is a great question. The answer is in this video of the play. Actually, I still don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer and I watched the video.  Even if Jones got a bad read on the ball, A\xe2\x80\x99s right fielder Danny Valencia still bumbles playing the carom and bobbles the pickup. And even considering those screwups, Jones still beat the ball to home plate, except he managed to slide into home plate without actually touching home with his front foot.  Jones was initially called safe. The play was overturned on review. So the Orioles lost a 1-0 game in which they had a run on the board in the first inning except for three baserunning screwups on the same play. When things are going bad, they really go bad.    Find something else in the world to make you happy because it\xe2\x80\x99s sure not going to be the Orioles doing it right now. They\xe2\x80\x99ve performed just about as poorly as you can possibly perform at the plate without getting no-hit against three mediocre-or-worse pitchers over the last three games. Chris Davis got two hits in this game, so I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s something. Former Orioles farmhand Andrew Triggs awaits in the 3:35 series finale on Thursday, which the O\xe2\x80\x99s will be trying to win to avoid being swept by a last place team that could barely be trying harder to lose. Triggs is 27 and has one MLB start under his belt. Perhaps that no-hitter is coming after all. Chris Tillman starts the finale for the Orioles and will be the latest victim of the O\xe2\x80\x99s offense going to sleep on the west coast. The Orioles have gotten six straight quality starts, for crying out loud, and they have lost four of those games. Good grief.

There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody out there who would dare suggest that the ten runs on Sunday in Chicago is the exception to the rule, and that the listless offense we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this week in Oakland is actually the norm. This is not a poor-hitting team; they\xe2\x80\x99re a team that\xe2\x80\x99s scuffling just a bit at the plate right now.And the sad thing is that the Birds squared a lot of balls up last night \xe2\x80\x93 heck, for this entire series. But the Oakland Coliseum is so big, that those balls seemed to find a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s glove.\xc2\xa0Manny Machado addressed this after the game (quote courtesy of Roch Kubatko, MASNsports):Every game counts, so it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult going out there and we can\xe2\x80\x99t find a break. We\xe2\x80\x99re squaring balls up and we can\xe2\x80\x99t really do anything about it. We\xe2\x80\x99re having good at-bats. We\xe2\x80\x99re doing what we need to do, trying to get guys over, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just not falling for us. So we just have to stay positive, stay together and keep playing as a team and keep doing it. Eventually things will turn around.So the question is\xc2\xa0what can the O\xe2\x80\x99s do to fix this? As Machado said, they\xe2\x80\x99re having good at-bats, and the ball just isn\xe2\x80\x99t falling.

08/12/2016,"[('With September call-ups approaching, the Orioles have ...', ' The Orioles are in the middle of a playoff push, and September is fast approaching. That means it\xe2\x80\x99s almost time for the O\xe2\x80\x99s (and every other team) to take advantage of one of the more controversial rules in baseball: September roster expansion. On the first of the month, the 25-player limit goes out the window, and teams are free to use up to their entire 40-man roster. Honestly, this seems a little ridiculous, and Buck Showalter agrees. He\xe2\x80\x99s previously advocated for a more reasonable expansion (something like 30 or 32 players), but that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to put the Orioles at a competitive disadvantage just to make a point. Still, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be seeing 40 players in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout three weeks from now. Buck doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like an overcrowded clubhouse and isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to carry guys just to carry them. It\xe2\x80\x99s more likely that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see the roster expand to something in the 33-35 player range.  That\xe2\x80\x99s what the team has done in recent seasons, although the situation is a little different this year. The Norfolk Tides\xe2\x80\x99 season will wrap up on September 5th, and at 50-68 it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say they won\xe2\x80\x99t make the playoffs. Last season, they weren\xe2\x80\x99t eliminated from the postseason until mid-September.     If anything, that could mean we\xe2\x80\x99ll see more players added to the big club. Whereas the 2015 Orioles might have preferred to have a younger pitcher get consistent innings for Norfolk rather than be the 12th man in the bullpen, that won\xe2\x80\x99t be a dilemma this time around. If they think they can use a player, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take him.    So, who might the call-ups be? First of all, we know that the team will call up at least a few pitchers to serve as bullpen help. Odrisamer Despaigne seems like an obvious choice, as do Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson. All three are likely to be in Baltimore in a few weeks. Beyond them, there are nine other pitchers currently on the 40-man roster. Brian Duensing is hurt, so he\xe2\x80\x99s out. Chris Lee and Parker Bridwell have never thrown a major league pitch, and that probably won\xe2\x80\x99t change next month.    T.J. McFarland is pitching a rehab assignment in Frederick on Monday, and if everything goes well he\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be back when the rosters expand. Jason Garcia is unlikely to be called up this year, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure Oliver Drake fits - he\xe2\x80\x99d be the tenth righty in the bullpen if Despaigne/Wilson/Wright all get the nod. Finally, there\xe2\x80\x99s a trio of three lefty specialists - Jayson Aquino, Logan Ondrusek (who\xe2\x80\x99s right-handed, but was acquired because of his reverse splits), and Ashur Tolliver. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good bet that the O\xe2\x80\x99s will take at least one, considering Zach Britton and Donnie Hart are the only lefties in the bullpen (McFarland would be the second). If Hart remains on the 25-man roster, Ondrusek seems like the most likely to join him. Moving on to position players, the easiest one to call is Joey Rickard, who will certainly be placed on the active roster if he\xe2\x80\x99s able to come back in time from his thumb injury. The only other outfielder on the 40-man who isn\xe2\x80\x99t currently in Baltimore is Dariel Alvarez - there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance we\xe2\x80\x99ll be seeing him again too.     Alvarez would be easier to call up, but for this team Julio Borbon seems like a better choice. The O\xe2\x80\x99s have corner outfielders in spades, especially when Rickard returns. Two things they don\xe2\x80\x99t have are guys who can run and guys who can play center field. I have a feeling we\xe2\x80\x99ll see a move to get Borbon in the fold for the stretch run. For infielders, it gets a bit trickier. Right now, the only infielder currently on the 40-man roster is Christian Walker. He may be added to the roster to serve as another right-handed bench bat (especially if Alvarez doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make the trip North) but he\xe2\x80\x99s not really what the O\xe2\x80\x99s need. What the O\xe2\x80\x99s need is someone like Paul Janish. He\xe2\x80\x99s the exact type of player who always gets called up to the big leagues in September - a one-dimensional defense-first player that can play every infield position. Finally, almost every team adds a third catcher this time of year. Francisco Pena is on the roster already. This one\xe2\x80\x99s easy. All in all, my guess is that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see a few more players than usual added to the Orioles clubhouse in a few weeks. Despaigne, Wilson, Wright, Pena and Rickard (if healthy) seem like near-locks. Throw in two of McFarland/Ondrusek/Aquino/Tolliver, which would bolster the bullpen\xe2\x80\x99s ability to match up with left-handed hitters.     Finally, Borbon and Janish fill specific needs and I\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised if Dan Duquette doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bring the ax down on couple low-ceiling players (Tolliver? Drake?) to make room for them. Add one of Walker/Alvarez and that gets the Orioles to an even 35 players. Clearly, the O\xe2\x80\x99s don\xe2\x80\x99t have an exciting top prospect ready to break into the bigs for the stretch run. None of the guys I just mentioned are less than 25, and none are really prospects at all.  But while the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t have a Dylan Bundy to bring up this time around, what they do have is are a ton of bullpen arms and a small group of veteran players who fit of the team\xe2\x80\x99s specific needs. The players might not be flashy, but at least the O\xe2\x80\x99s have plenty of options.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORESAN FRANCISCO (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 After three straight wins, including consecutive starts in which he threw five scoreless innings, Matt Cain lost his command Friday night and the San Francisco Giants lost in their return home from a nine-game road trip.Cain (4-7) allowed five runs and 11 hits in four-plus innings, including home runs by Mark Trumbo and Chris Davis, and the Giants lost 5-2 to the Baltimore Orioles in a game between teams fighting for division leads.""I just got pitches back on the plate a little bit more today,"" Cain said. ""I got the heaters on the plate and they didn\'t miss them.""Giants manager Bruce Bochy said Cain ""didn\'t have his good fastball command.""""A lot of them came back over the plate,"" Bochy said. ""They\'re a good hitting ball club with a lot of power. They took advantage of him. He just didn\'t have his good command. So that was pretty much the story. He got a lot of balls up.""In just his sixth career start, Dylan Bundy relied on mental strength more than physical dominance to pitch the Orioles back into first place in the AL East.Bundy allowed one run and three hits in 5 2-3 innings, Trumbo regained the major league lead with his 33rd home run and Zach Britton notched his 36th save.Orioles manager Buck Showalter said Bundy (6-3) didn\'t have a good feel for his curveball and ""it was good seeing him compete and fight through it.""Bundy acknowledged he didn\'t have command of his pitches at points and refused to blame it on a cool night in San Francisco, with the temperature in the 50s.""Weather is the easy excuse, but it was just that you can\'t have your best stuff every time,"" Bundy said. ""You just got to focus a little more, get the ball over the plate and let them get themselves out.""Trumbo\'s two-run homer in the third inning traveled an estimated 441 feet, landing near the back of the stands in left field. Earlier Friday, Toronto\'s Edwin Encarnacion hit his 32nd home run to tie Trumbo for the MLB lead.Trumbo said he hadn\'t known that Encarnacion had homered, and said it was way too early to worry about who\'s leading the majors in homers.""The win matters, I don\'t care about the other stuff,"" he said.The Orioles\' win, coupled with the Blue Jays\' 5-3 home loss to Houston, moved Baltimore back into first place by a half-game over Toronto. The Giants retained their one-game lead in the NL West over the Los Angeles Dodgers, who lost 5-1 at home to Pittsburgh.Davis led off the fifth with his 24th homer of the season for the Orioles, who are 4-4 on a 10-game road trip that ends Sunday in San Francisco. Matt Wieters and Adam Jones had RBIs in the Orioles\' two-run second.Denard Span drove in San Francisco\'s first run with a third-inning double. Brandon Belt added an RBI single in the ninth.Britton, who leads the AL in saves, has not blown a save this season, and hasn\'t allowed an earned run in his last 40 games.The Giants have lost eight of their last 10 interleague games.TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: Showalter said RHP Darren O\'Day was sent home to Baltimore for tests after experiencing shoulder discomfort in Thursday\'s relief appearance at Oakland. ... Showalter said INF Steve Pearce, who has missed four games with an injured flexor tendon in his right arm, should be ready to return Saturday.Giants: Bochy said there\'s no date set for the return of RHP Cory Gearrin, who has made five relief appearances at Triple-A Sacramento while rehabbing from a right shoulder strain.BRONZED PERRYThe Giants will dedicate a nine-foot bronze statue to Hall of Fame pitcher Gaylord Perry on Saturday before their game against the Orioles. Fellow Giants Hall of Famers Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Juan Marichal and Orlando Cepeda, all of whom already have statues outside AT&T Park, are expected to attend. Perry, 77, talking before Friday\'s game, as usual refused to say whether he ever doctored the ball during his 22-year MLB career.GIANTS HOMECOMINGThe Giants opened a 10-game homestand after finishing a 4-5 road trip to Philadelphia, Washington and Miami. Bochy said he was looking forward to having 15 of the team\'s next 18 games in San Francisco. ""It\'s important to have a good homestand and get back to who we are,"" he said. ""We\'ve been sputtering since the All-Star break.""UP NEXTOrioles: Kevin Gausman (3-9, 4.02 ERA) starts Saturday against the Giants. He is tied for the team lead with quality starts in 60 percent of his 20 outings this season.Giants: Madison Bumgarner (10-7, 2.20) makes his 25th start of 2016 on Saturday.

MLB needs to address it\xe2\x80\x99s system \xe2\x80\x93 and soon.For starters, the Baltimore Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose 6-2 last night in San Francisco because of an instant replay snafu. They lost because they could only put two runs on the board, didn\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of opportunities, and because San Francisco took advantage of theirs. The fact that\xc2\xa0Kevin Gausman walked six hitters didn\xe2\x80\x99t help either; Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.0 IP, 2 H, 2 R, 6 BB, 9 K.Having said that, one of the big opportunities of which San Francisco took advantage came on the heels of a confusing and frustrating moment in the sixth inning in which the Orioles found themselves gerrymandered out of an out. One play a game does not make \xe2\x80\x93 and that goes without saying. However when cracks appear in a system that\xe2\x80\x99s designed to get the call right, it presents a huge problem. And someone out there has to be taxed with fixing it\xe2\x80\xa6looking at you, Mr. Commissioner.San Francisco took a 2-0 in the second on Span\xe2\x80\x99s two-RBI double. He would add a two-RBI single in the last of the sixth, which followed the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 protestation of the instant replay call in the top of the inning. One inning later San Francisco blew the game wide open as Belt smacked a two-run homer to run the score to 6-0.

The ball appeared to catch part of Jones\xe2\x80\x99 hand as well, and it landed in fair terrority \xe2\x80\x93 he was quickly thrown out, but he doubled over in pain. (He would stay in the game, and he says he\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready for today\xe2\x80\x99s game as well.) Interestingly, Jones remained on the field during the medical look-over, which was strange given that he had grounded out\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6but Jones knew he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t grounded out. The ball had hit his finger, and then it actually touched his knee before landing fair. Home plate umpire Brian O\xe2\x80\x99Nora ruled that Jones had offered at the pitch, which is why the call on the field was a fair ball. Manager\xc2\xa0Buck Showalter induced a bit of a delay trying to argue his case for a replay review. After awhile the umpires got on the headset to New York, only to apparently be told that the play wasn\xe2\x80\x99t reviewable.I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that the umpires are out to get the Orioles or anything like that (although some Oriole players did have an interesting opinion on O\xe2\x80\x99Nora\xe2\x80\x99s strike zone.) I do firmly believe that umpires want to get these calls right, and that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything they can to do so. However if the system that\xe2\x80\x99s designed to help them get it right is actually preventing them from doing so, that\xe2\x80\x99s a huge problem.Hit-by-a-pitch is actually reviewable \xe2\x80\x93 however it would have been inconclusive as to whether or not the ball hit Jones before hitting the bat and so forth. (However obviously Jones\xe2\x80\x99 reaction told us that the ball hit him.) What they wanted to review was whether or not the ball hit Jones\xe2\x80\x99 knee before landing fair. If it did, they it\xe2\x80\x99s a foul ball. And the replay was pretty conclusive that it hit Jones\xe2\x80\x99 knee.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerSo my question is\xc2\xa0why is this not reviewable? I mean, is there a legitiate reason why plays in front of the base umpires can\xe2\x80\x99t be reviewed? I suspect that there is, and that reason in fact might even be fairly legitimate. However to piggyback on what I said above, a system that\xe2\x80\x99s designed to get calls right shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t in turn prevent those calls from being made. That makes no sense\xe2\x80\xa6again, looking at you, Mr. Commissioner.Buck Showalter was given the standard answer about the call not being reviewable at the time (quote courtesy of Roch Kubatko, MASNsports):First, it was a challenge. They had to go there. The ball hits his finger and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make an attempt at it, it\xe2\x80\x99s a dead ball, OK? They say it\xe2\x80\x99s non-reviewable once he made an attempt at it, so there was no challenge and we were told it was non-reviewable.If that play is reviewed and presumably overturned, Jones continues his at-bat. It\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to assume that all things would have been the same in that inning given that scenario. However the Birds ended up with two runners in scoring position and one out in that inning. If Jones gets on, perhaps the Orioles score at least one run. That could have changed the entire scope of the game.Or it could have not changed anything. With the way that Bumgarner was painting the corners and the way that Oriole pitchers were nibbling on those same corners and having their pitches called balls, there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance nothing would have changed. All of that is a very tough sell.However what\xe2\x80\x99s not a tough sell is that something needs to change in the instant replay system. In some cases we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see calls overturned leaguewide without clear evidence, as well as calls left to stand that had clear evidence. And in cases like this, the system itself doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow for the correct call to be made. How doe it play if a team finds itself out of the race by one game and they had a situation like this at some point along the way? Something needs to change, Mr. Commissioner.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles: This side of the Bay Area is kinderThe series will conclude this afternoon in San Francisco.\xc2\xa0Wade Miley will get the start for the Orioles, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by SF\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Johnny Cueto.

The O\xe2\x80\x99s then had a runner at second base with two outs in the the ninth, with Trumbo coming to the plate again. However San Francisco wanted no part of Trumbo potentially tying the game at that late hour. So they pitched around him\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6to get to\xc2\xa0Jonathan Schoop. From San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s perspective it was probably very simple; Schoop records the final out, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the end of it. The hometown fans go home happy, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s go home with questions about where their season is going. That\xe2\x80\x99s how they may have drawn it up \xe2\x80\x93 but sometimes the best-laid plans can be foiled.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerSchoop jumped on a fastball on an 0-1 count. The left fielder never stood a chance, and San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s gamble in walking Trumbo backfired. Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s three-run homer gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s an improbably 8-7 win, which turned into an 8-7 victory.

"", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('A Recap of the Baltimore Orioles\\u2019 West Coast Trip', 'Aug 12, 2016; San Francisco, CA, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Dylan Bundy (37) throws to the San Francisco Giants in the first inning of their MLB baseball game at AT&T Park. Mandatory Credit: Lance Iversen-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles just finished a road trip at 5-5. \xc2\xa0Not just any road trip, but a West Coast road trip in Oakland and San Francisco, with the Chicago White Sox at the start.For a team that is 27-34 on the road, to split a West Coast trip (their last of the year) is not bad. But, there are several items inside the games that help make the trip another successful one for the Orioles.First, they won two of the three series. Only a 1-3 series against the Oakland Athletics was a series loss for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. They beat the White Sox in two out of three and did the same to the NL West-leading San Francisco Giants.The pitching in the games was pretty good. The O\xe2\x80\x99s left up 5 (in a bizarre game where the bullpen blew up), 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 6 (another game where the bullpen struggled), 2, 6, and 7 runs in those ten games.These were the numbers by the starters in those 10 games:1 \xe2\x80\x93 7-5 W over the White Sox: Gallardo (W) 6 IP, 7 H, 2 ER, 3 K2 \xe2\x80\x93 2-4 L vs. CWS: Tillman (L) 6 IP, 7 H, 3 ER, 4 K3 \xe2\x80\x93 10-2 W vs CWS: Bundy (W) 6 IP, 4 H, 2 ER, 9 K4 \xe2\x80\x93 2-3 L vs. Athletics: Gausman (L) 6 IP, 6 H, 2 ER, 6 K5 \xe2\x80\x93 1-2 L vs. A\xe2\x80\x99s: Miley (L) 6 IP, 6 H, 2 ER, 2 K6 \xe2\x80\x93 0-1 L vs. A\xe2\x80\x99s: Gallardo (L) 6 IP, 4 H, 1 ER, 6 K7 \xe2\x80\x93 9-6 W vs. A\xe2\x80\x99s: Tillman (W) 7 IP, 5 H, 2 ER, 4 K8 \xe2\x80\x93 5-2 W vs. Giants: Bundy (W) 5.2 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 3 K9 \xe2\x80\x93 2-6 L vs. Giants: Gausman (L) 4 IP, 2 H, 2 ER, 9 K 6 BB10 \xe2\x80\x93 8-7 W vs. Giants: Miley 4.1 IP, 8 H, 6 ER, 1 KSo, what can we take from those starts? \xc2\xa0Well, the only one in which the starting pitcher did not get a decision was the comeback win on Sunday, where Wade Miley exited early and struggled.In addition, the first seven games of the trip were all quality starts. However, four of them were losses. \xc2\xa0So, the offensive struggles continue to keep the O\xe2\x80\x99s from the top of their potential.Dylan Bundy earned wins in both his starts, Kevin Gausman losses in both of his, although he only allowed two runs in each start.Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s start on Saturday was hampered by six walks, although comments by both he and Buck Showalter after the game indicated he was better than his line.For a team that continues to be all about the pitching, this trip was a success. \xc2\xa0The only pitcher who is really not keeping the O\xe2\x80\x99s in games at this point is Wade Miley. \xc2\xa0Hopefully he can settle in over the next few starts.The bullpen had a few hiccups, but not enough to blow any games. The Birds will have to rely on Mychal Givens more, and also Donnie Hart. \xc2\xa0Hart has been very good in his use as a lefty specialist.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('The state of the Orioles bullpen with Darren O\\u2019Day back on ...', ' The good Orioles teams during the Buck Showalter/Dan Duquette era have been led by their bullpens. Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s adeptness at not only using his relievers in game, but keeping them fresh and able throughout the season has been a key to the Orioles winning more games than most people ever thought they ever would.     This is combined with Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s ability to constantly shuffle the roster to bring in fresh quality arms for Showalter to deploy.  One of the keys to the bullpen over the last five seasons has been Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and he just went down with a shoulder injury. This off the heels of a strained hamstring that kept him out for nearly two months. Not the ideal scenario the Orioles had when they surprisingly resigned O\xe2\x80\x99Day this off season for four years and $31 million.  The injuries are also on top of some poor performance with a 3.95 ERA. However, even while missing the all important O\xe2\x80\x99Day, the Orioles bullpen has still managed a 3.19 ERA, the best in the American league just beating out the Houston Astros.     With O\xe2\x80\x99Day out again the shuffling of the bullpen will begin. Tyler Wilson part time starter and part time reliever is back. When last with the Orioles he pitched four perfect innings and was then optioned to keep the bullpen flexible. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough life being the 25th man on a Dan Duquette roster.     The bullpen as it stands now is Zach Britton, Brad Brach, Mychal Givens, Donnie Hart, Tyler Wilson, Vance Worley, and Ubaldo Jimenez. With Brian Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s early season departure the bullpen has lacked a true left handed specialist.  This has put pressure on either inexperienced players\xe2\x80\x94such as Hart or Ashur Tolliver\xe2\x80\x94or on Brad Brach to get out left handed hitters in late game situations. The wear and tear may be showing on Brach as he has a 3.60 ERA in the second half compared to a 0.91 ERA in the first half.     The results have been even worse in August as he has posted a 5.40 ERA to date. Showalter has responded by trying to pitch him less, only 10 innings so far in the second half and he still leads all Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 relievers in innings.  With no left handed pitcher, Brach\xe2\x80\x99s struggles of late, O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s injury, and Givens\xe2\x80\x99 struggles against left handed hitters the Orioles are definitely in need of someone to get left handed hitters out.  Whether that is Donnie Hart or someone picked up during this August waiver period remains to be seen. I have faith that Givens can learn to get left handed batters out, but now is not the time for the Orioles to have that faith. They need a backup plan or a break out.     The Orioles as a pitching staff could use some help against left handed batters. Collectively, left handed hitters have a .344 wOBA against Orioles pitchers this year, that\xe2\x80\x99s the third highest in baseball. For reference, right handed hitters have a .303 wOBA against Orioles pitchers in 2016, which is right around the middle of the pack in baseball.  The right handed heavy rotation for the predominant part of the season has something to do with that. I wanted to see what the bullpen\xe2\x80\x99s numbers were specifically, but I could not readily find that split anywhere online.  Otherwise, the bullpen is definitely weighed down by Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s presence. He has wobbled back and forth between effective and ineffective in his short and infrequent stints as a reliever in 2016.  Who would have thought that Jimenez would be inconsistent? Worley and Wilson provide decent options for when Showalter needs some innings eaten up, but both have their own warts. The move of Dylan Bundy to the rotation has hurt the bullpen some. He was a lights out reliever before he was a lights out starter.  However, with two option-able spots and a bevy of mediocre options available in the minors Showalter assuredly always has at least a fresh arm to go to, if not always a quality arm to go to.     The bullpen is far from the Orioles main concern (that would be the offense getting back on track and smashing balls into outer space again), but it is not without it\xe2\x80\x99s own issues.  Having the O\xe2\x80\x99Day of years past would make it truly formidable as Givens and Brach would be pushed back into the sixth and seventh innings and could be matched up on particular nights for particular lineups. But, with his injuries to date this year that O\xe2\x80\x99Day has not been around. The struggles against left handed hitters needs to be solved and the sooner the better.  Yet, the ultimate weapon in Zach Britton still exists. His sub 1 ERA, sky high ground ball rate, and perfect record so far in 2016 gives the Orioles the ultimate closer. With him at the back end, the bullpen has a high floor.  The Orioles will need the others to step up in O\xe2\x80\x99Days absence. With September right around the corner and roster expansion along with it, Showalter will have even more toys to play with. For our sake, let\xe2\x80\x99s hope it all works out.

Of their 45 games remaining in the regular season, the Orioles only play 10 against sub-.500 teams, seven versus the Tampa Bay Rays and three versus the Arizona Diamondbacks.There are some favorable nuances in the remaining schedule \xe2\x80\x93 three off days in September, for instance \xe2\x80\x93 and some unfavorable things, such as non-division games against a trio of tough opponents: The Houston Astros, Detroit Tigers and National League East power Washington Nationals.Ultimately, the Orioles control their own destiny. Win at their current pace, win enough in the division and on the road, and get into the playoffs. That, of course, is simplistic. Here are five things the Orioles must do to have a better chance at their third postseason in five years.***Bring down the AL EastThe ultimate goal is to get into the playoffs, no matter the manner of entrance. So winning the American League East is not essential. But the division crown is there for the taking. The Orioles play 31 of their final 45 games against division rivals: six versus the Toronto Blue Jays, seven versus the Rays and nine each against the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees.The Orioles are currently 26-19 against AL East teams, the best record of the group. The Blue Jays have the second best mark at 27-21. The Blue Jays have won seven of 13 against the Orioles this season with six left to play \xe2\x80\x93 three each in Baltimore and Toronto.Obviously, the Orioles would love to get home-field advantage and force the Blue Jays into a one-game Wild Card matchup. A big help would be beating Toronto in four of the next six head-to-head matchups to win the season series.***Win on the roadThe Orioles are great at Camden Yards, better than any team in the AL at 39-17. Only the National League Central\xe2\x80\x99s Chicago Cubs have more home wins than the Orioles.But that road record, 27-34, is much less desirable. When I recently wrote about the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 road troubles, one commentor on our Facebook page asked, almost defensively, \xe2\x80\x9cHow many teams are good on the road?\xe2\x80\x9dThe answer: Of the seven clubs currently playing .560 or better baseball, only the Orioles have a losing road record. It\xe2\x80\x99s just one of those baseball truisms \xe2\x80\x93 good teams win on the road. The Orioles have 20 games away from Camden Yards remaining, and they need to make the most of them. Not sure what the formula is \xe2\x80\x93 more focus? \xe2\x80\x93 but it\xe2\x80\x99s imperative to turn more than half of those contests into victories.***Produce a quality lefty specialistThis is something the Orioles should have done at the beginning of the season, or when they released Brian Matusz or when Brian Duensing got hurt or when the trade deadline came and went.Orioles executive vice president Dan Duquette tried to acquire a lefty specialist in July, but the price was too hefty. Now, with versatile, right-handed set-up man Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day on the shelf, adding someone who can retire left-handers late in games becomes more of a need. You can\xc2\xa0read more about my thoughts on that in this piece.The Orioles are hoping that 25-year-old rookie Donnie Hart, a 27th round pick in 2013, can do the job; lefties are just 1-for-11 against him in five games (right-handers are 2-for-4 in the big leagues versus Hart).And maybe Hart can be the guy. But since he has never been in such high-pressure situations in the past, it certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt to add someone who has done it more often on a big stage. There\xe2\x80\x99s still a shot a lefty specialist can be acquired in a trade this month, or maybe Duquette will have to reach into his magic hat and pull out another candidate from parts unknown. But further bolstering the bullpen \xe2\x80\x93 the club\xe2\x80\x99s true strength \xe2\x80\x93 will go a long way in keeping the Orioles on the playoff path.***Dylan Bundy has started six games this season.\xc2\xa0(Photo: Tommy Gilligan, USA TODAY Sports)Get consistency from rotationThis has been the biggest concern all year. Yet since the All-Star Break, the rotation has been solid, certainly enough to put the team in position to win. But, frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s still a bit of a mystery.Chris Tillman has been exceptionally consistent and Dylan Bundy has been a savior since being inserted into the rotation. But you\xe2\x80\x99re not being fully honest if you say you know what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get from Yovani Gallardo, Kevin Gausman and Wade Miley each time on the mound.Gallardo has thrown quality starts in three of his last five outings, but the occasional, rocky five-inning performance is squarely in his portfolio. Gausman has dominant stuff, but can\xe2\x80\x99t always harness it. And Miley has been OK, good and flat-out awful in his three starts since being traded to the Orioles on July 31.Everyone wants a formidable rotation; a solid, consistent one would be enough to get the Orioles into the postseason.***Light a fire under Chris DavisIt\xe2\x80\x99s probably unfair to single out one player on this list. But this one player has been the Most Valuable Oriole two times in the past three seasons and signed a $161 million contract in the offseason.Since the All-Star Break, the offense has had its share of missteps; it\xe2\x80\x99s s not just one guy. But Chris Davis has been the poster boy for the struggles. He\xe2\x80\x99s hitting .160 with a .295 on-base percentage and .234 slugging percentage in 27 second-half games \xe2\x80\x93 and that includes a recent run in which he had three consecutive, two-hit performances. But Davis followed up that streak with six strikeouts in his last seven at-bats. He\xe2\x80\x99s struck out 162 times (and has 67 walks) in 486 plate appearances.By now, you know what you get with Davis. And, oftentimes, what you get is a big finish. In his career, he\xe2\x80\x99s best at the end of the season. He\xe2\x80\x99s hit .294 with a .369 on-base percentage and .554 slugging percentage \xe2\x80\x93 all career highs for a month \xe2\x80\x94 after Sept. 1.And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Orioles need this year. Davis missed the end of 2014 \xe2\x80\x93 the last time the club made the playoffs \xe2\x80\x93 due to his suspension for using the ADHD drug Adderall. He so badly wants to celebrate with his team this year \xe2\x80\x93 and if he gets going like he can, the odds of the Orioles having a September celebration is much, much better.Connolly writes for BaltimoreBaseball.com, an affiliate of USA TODAY Sports Media Group.CONNECTTWEET                              2                      LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com')]"

08/18/2016,"[('Don\\u2019t panic about the Orioles, unless they lose tonight ...', ' Darkness is closing in and the long night is upon us. The light of the 2016 Orioles is fading before our very eyes.    Or at least that\xe2\x80\x99s the dramatic impulse that it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely understandable to have. The recent experience for O\xe2\x80\x99s fans, say for the last 15 years, is that everything is either really, really horrible, or that everything is pretty good by the time the calendar heads towards late August. The post-All Star break time has been closer to horrible than good, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not horrible either. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, well, meh. One experience that we do not have in Orioles fan land is following a good team, not quite a great team, that comes up short against other good teams that aren\xe2\x80\x99t quite great. The AL East is a race of three flawed teams where the O\xe2\x80\x99s flaws are presently the most exposed. That\xe2\x80\x99s not as fun as the Orioles romping through the division and into the ALCS, nor as fun as if they light September on fire and claim a wild card spot. Think about it. In the 2012 season, there were no real expectations for the Orioles. They hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even really gone on their run yet. They were six games back after a win on August 18. Two years later, they were 7.5 games up on the closest competitor on this day. They might not have clinched yet, but it was obvious which way the wind was blowing.    This whole, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, they\xe2\x80\x99re only two games back, but two days ago they were tied and in first place,\xe2\x80\x9d what are we supposed to do with that? It\xe2\x80\x99s a close race. Every single development, good or bad, in a close race feels like it\xe2\x80\x99s amplified in its importance.     Lose two games against the Red Sox? It\xe2\x80\x99s a disaster! The Orioles are choking the season away! That is true. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in action and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been fun. But also: The Orioles have stunk for a month and they\xe2\x80\x99re only two games back, and they\xe2\x80\x99re still two games up for the second wild card spot! They are capable of better than this. We know they are because we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen it. All they have to do is right the ship a bit and get back on track. The AL East will be a tough battle even if they do so, but the playoffs should stay within their grasp.    This is a lot more fun than if the Orioles are 32.5 games out on this date, which they were just six years ago, shortly after Buck Showalter took over as manager. Ty Wigginton was the Orioles All-Star that year, for crying out loud. They only had the one. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad thing to be spoiled by actually having expectations. The only reason that O\xe2\x80\x99s fans are now feeling disappointment and dread is because they had the audacity to be better than everybody in the wider baseball media expected up until now. None of us would want the O\xe2\x80\x99s to switch places in the standings with the Yankees, though Yankees fans may be feeling better about how the last two weeks have gone for their team. Only after they were given up as failures did they do a little winning. Their fans can be excited because some of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Yankees are coming up and doing well.    The Orioles, on the other hand, don\xe2\x80\x99t need tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles because they\xe2\x80\x99re already pretty good. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing they don\xe2\x80\x99t need tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles anyway, because there are none.  They just need their already-good hitters to bust out of the team-wide slump they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in for a month. They might do it. They\xe2\x80\x99re good enough to do it. Are they going to do it? I have no idea! The unknown is terrifying. Hope is frightening. Only the person with hopes can have them crushed. Yet we know what the world with no hope is like. Numbness and constant misery carry the day, every day.  This is something different. In six weeks time, it could turn out to be something awesome, or before then it could be revealed to be horrible.  What if the Orioles decide to set another strikeout record when the play the Astros over the next four games? What if Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder isn\xe2\x80\x99t better after a few days rest? What if the kind of 1-12 streak that plagued them at the end of last August is still around the corner? Those are the horrible possibilities. There are good ones too. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them already this year. Remember when the Orioles ripped off seven game winning streaks in each of April, May, and June, even though their starting pitching has never been good? The Orioles averaged 6.6 runs per game in June. The players responsible for that are all still here.    The Orioles have 43 games left in which to make a comeback. They could get back into a tie within two games if everything breaks right. Or they could be out of a wild card spot in three games if everything breaks wrong. In short, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to panic about the Orioles... unless they lose tonight. Then everyone can pack everything in because the season is over.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles fall to third in battle with inconsistency', ""The Baltimore Orioles appear to be once again battling inconsistency at the plate in the wake of their rain-shortened 8-1 loss to Boston. As a result, the Orioles have now fallen to third place in the American League East, and Boston swept the two-game series. Now having said that, fans should keep two things in perspective\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6first off, the O\xe2\x80\x99s would be in the playoffs if the season ended today. They would be the second wild card team, and would play in the Wild Card game \xe2\x80\x93 vs. Boston (at Fenway Park). Is that ideal? Not really. But the Orioles would be in the postseason if the season ended today. Secondly, they\xe2\x80\x99re only two games out of first place.Dylan Bundy strugged against a Boston lineup that seems to have everything going it\xe2\x80\x99s way right now. Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.1 IP, 9 H, 5 R, 2 BB, 2 K. Bundy was pitching-to-contact, and Boston was making contact and putting balls in play. While you want a guy to pitch-to-contact, that\xe2\x80\x99s usually a bad combination.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley The Baltimore WireCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireThe lone Oriole run was a\xc2\xa0Chris Davis solo homer with Boston already leading 1-0 in the last of the second. One inning later Boston re-took the lead on a Bradley two-run homer, and then got another two-run homer in the fifth from Leon. They also knotched two RBI-doubles from Ortiz and Bradley (who\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double scored two) in the sixth to run the lead to 8-1.The game itself went into a rain delay after the sixth inning, and was never resumed due to some fairly serious storms that passed through the Baltimore area last night. So with that said, should fans be concerned about the course of the season? I mean\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that moving down into third place isn\xe2\x80\x99t what one would want \xe2\x80\x93 right?That goes without saying. However remember what I said above \xe2\x80\x93 the O\xe2\x80\x99s are only two games out of first. Boston\xe2\x80\x99s been hot for some time, and that continued when they came into play the Orioles. That\xe2\x80\x99s probably why we saw various players doing chest bumps out on the field following home runs, which is about as non-traditional in a sport like baseball as you can get. However some would also argue that it\xe2\x80\x99s simply Boston rolling into the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re hot. The alternative I suppose would be to plug along as if it were nothing\xe2\x80\xa6which in theory could emotionally induce inconsistency.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerSo is that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with the Orioles?

Did they in effect steer away from \xe2\x80\x9cBig Mo?\xe2\x80\x9d If not celebrating runs by not showing up the opponent is steering away from momentum, then yes I suppose they did.

The division race is tight, and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t see the Orioles simply falling out of it. There are probably some crass people out there saying the season\xe2\x80\x99s over, and heck for all I know they may be right. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s all downhill from here and at the end of the day all the people to whom I told\xc2\xa0they\xe2\x80\x99ll be in it until the end because of their offensive power will revolt against me \xe2\x80\x93 because their bats went to sleep.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles set a major league record by hitting four home runs in the first inning before making an out.Unfortunately, they still had eight innings left to play.Wade Miley and a host of Baltimore pitchers struggled for much of the game, and the Orioles wasted five homers in a 15-8 loss to the Houston Astros on Friday night.Coming off a six-homer performance on Thursday, the Orioles picked up where they left off against Houston starter Collin McHugh, becoming the first team in the modern era (since 1900) to open a game with four home runs before making an out, according to STATS.Adam Jones hit McHugh\'s first pitch into the seats in left field and Hyun Soo Kim singled before Manny Machado, Chris Davis and Mark Trumbo homered in succession.But Houston answered with a five-run second to go up 6-5. Jose Altuve capped the surge with a two-run double with two outs to chase Miley, who matched the shortest start of his career.""It was terrible. It\'s embarrassing for that to happen,"" he said. ""I flat-out stunk.""The left-hander is 0-2 with a 9.53 ERA in four starts since being traded from Seattle on July 31.He wasn\'t the only culprit. Five Baltimore pitchers combined to give up a season-high 15 runs and 18 hits.""I know he\'s frustrated, but he\'s not the only one who struggled pitching tonight,"" manager Buck Showalter said.Altuve homered and had five RBIs to help the Astros end a five-game skid. George Springer went 4 for 5 with a home run for Houston, which also got long balls from Evan Gattis and Teoscar Hernandez.Chris Devenski (2-4) allowed one hit in four innings for the Astros after McHugh yielded seven runs and nine hits in three innings.""I don\'t know if I\'ve ever been blitzed like that before in my career,"" the right-hander said. ""Today\'s game in general was kind of a crazy.""Springer provided a glimpse of things to come by hitting a leadoff homer on the fifth pitch from Miley.After the teams traded five-run innings, Baltimore went up 7-6 in the third and Houston pulled even in the fourth.The Astros took a 9-7 lead against Ubaldo Jimenez (5-10) in the fifth. Hernandez blooped an RBI single to center and Springer greeted Tyler Wilson with a run-scoring single.Pedro Alvarez homered in the bottom half before Houston pulled away in the sixth, getting a two-run homer from Altuve and a solo shot from Gattis.Showalter doesn\'t expect this defeat to linger with his team.""Our guys turn the page very quickly, just like their team did before tonight\'s game,"" he said.Trumbo, who leads the majors with 36 homers, shrugged off the loss.""It\'s going to happen throughout the course of the year,"" he said. ""We\'ve had a lot of good times, and some not-so-good times, and this will be one of them. Everyone is this room has dealt with it many times before. It\'s not easy to brush off, but I think we\'re equipped to do it.""ROSTER MOVESAstros: Optioned reliever James Hoyt to Triple-A Fresno and recalled Brad Peacock from the same club.

', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Orioles lose shootout to Astros, fall 15-8 with ugly ...', ' The Orioles scored a lot of runs on this particular Friday night, but the combined performances on the mound didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly help the cause in a quest to get one game closer to the top of the AL East.    The recap Orioles starter Wade Miley didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly get off to the best of starts; in fact, the first batter of the game resulted in the worst possible outcome.  After falling behind to George Springer 3-0, Miley forced a 3-1 fastball right to the center of Springer\xe2\x80\x99s bat. The leadoff man launched a home run to right-center, putting the Astros up early by a run. Brilliantly shaking off the rough start however, Miley worked his quick-paced magic to strike out the side following the solo shot. Carlos Correa, Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman  all went down swinging.    Fortunately, the bottom half of the inning belonged to the Orioles. And as an offense of their caliber is supposed to, they owned it against Houston starter Collin HcHugh.    Adam Jones led-off with a first pitch solo shot, but that was only the beginning. After he hit one over the left-field wall, the magic at Camden Yards kicked into full gear.  Hyun-Soo Kim came up next and singled, an at-bat that would ultimately be a disappointment in the grand scheme of the inning. After Kim, Manny Machado lined a hard-hit fly ball that barely snuck over the wall in center. That made it 3-0 Orioles with no outs, hardly the best part of the inning.    The duo of Chris Davis and Mark Trumbo outdid the performance of the top-third of the lineup, both launching massive home runs. Davis rocketed one of his longest HRs on a first-pitch fastball, while Trumbo(mb) took a 2-2 offering to the opposite field.  That\xe2\x80\x99s right \xe2\x80\x94 5 runs, 4 home runs, 0 outs. McHugh would eventually get out of the inning, but not before allowing another pair of singles. After the first inning, his line looked like this: 1 IP, 7 H, 5 ER, 4 HRs.  How\xe2\x80\x99s that for a first inning? Unfortunately the excitement wasn\xe2\x80\x99t over with. Miley couldn\xe2\x80\x99t shut down the Astros in the following half inning to keep the Camden Yards momentum \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even finish his second-inning work.    Given a four-run lead, the right-hander cut off any bit of momentum he might\xe2\x80\x99ve had with the first batter in the second.  After Evan Gattis singled to start the inning, the Astros strung together four more hits, including a hit batsman, to put up a whopping runs in the inning. Tyler White and Alex Bregman notched RBI doubles, cutting the Orioles lead to 5-4.  And just as Miley looked to potentially strand a pair of runners, Jose Altuve slapped a line drive to the opposite field, scoring two more to give Houston the lead. After the colossal mess, Buck Showalter had seen enough. He gave Miley the hook after 1.2 innings, in which he allowed six hits and six runs (all earned) over just 44 pitches \xe2\x80\x94 not exactly the ideal outing. Ubaldo Jimenez entered the game to a large ovation from Orioles fans (strange, yes) and ultimately captured the final out of the inning. After just an inning and a half, the Astros were on top, 6-5.    Starting in the bottom of the third, another, albeit much shorter, string of runs were put on the board by both sides.  Jonathan Schoop took advantage of a leadoff Trumbo walk to score tie things up at six, while a wild curveball in the dirt from McHugh scored another to put the Birds up, 7-6. But when Jimenez took the mound in the fourth, Houston quickly found a way to knot the game. Ubaldo consistently had trouble finding the zone, ultimately leading to the Astros\xe2\x80\x99 seventh run of the night. After a leadoff walk from Jimenez, Bregman laced a weak single to left-center to tie the ballgame yet again.  Overall, Jimenez struggled to do what he has in all of 2016: repeat a delivery and pound the zone with strikes.  In the fifth, Houston again capitalized on the mistakes of the man on the mound. Extending the inning with a walk and several lengthy at-bats, Jimenez surrendered the eighth run of the game on a bloop single in the triangle in right-center.     This time, Teoscar Hernandez was credited with the RBI \xe2\x80\x94 it put the Astros up 8-7 and chased Jimenez out of the game before the inning could end.  He\xe2\x80\x99d finish his three innings of laborious work with 52 pitches, throwing an even split of 26 balls and 26 strikes. Classically in the game of baseball, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a very good ratio. Tyler Wilson entered and allowed one of Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s baserunners to score on a single, giving the Astros a two-run advantage after their visiting at-bats in the fifth. Luckily, Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 rocket arm accounted for the third out of the inning, ending the madness. With one out in the bottom of the fifth, Pedro Alvarez joined in on the home run derby in front of the packed house at Oriole Park. He sent a first-pitch fastball from reliever Chris Devenski into the seats in right, cutting Houston\xe2\x80\x99s lead to 9-8.  C\xe2\x80\x99mon ... you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think this one was over, did you?    After five innings, there were 17 total runs scored, 20 hits sprayed around and five different pitchers to toe the rubber. How\xe2\x80\x99s that for Friday night baseball fun? For Wilson, Friday night was far from fun. It was dreadful. In a nutshell: a nightmare. When he took the hill in the top of the sixth, he had a chance to settle the Astros down to give the offense an opportunity to do their thing. But as the script of this night seemed to go, the guy pitching in orange and black completely unraveled. After allowing a leadoff single, Jose Altuve turned on, and crushed, a first-pitch fastball that caught every bit of the zone. It sailed far into the seats in left, a long way away from the catcher\xe2\x80\x99s mitt. That gave Houston a 11-8 lead, but they weren\xe2\x80\x99t done. Two batters later, Evan Gattis launched a hanging curve over the wall in left to tally another run on the board. Just like that, before Wilson could wrangle two outs, the Astros captured their biggest lead of the night.    Unfortunately, it only got worse from there. When Wilson couldn\xe2\x80\x99t settle down in the seventh, Vance Worley entered and proceeded to allow baserunner after baserunner. A walk and pair of singles led to two more runs, giving Houston a 14-8 advantage. From there, the rest of the way was quiet and uneventful. Another run crossed on Vance Worley\xe2\x80\x99s watch, but the offense couldn\xe2\x80\x99t muster anything the rest of the way. With the loss, the Orioles fall to 67-54. A Toronto loss and Boston win puts the Birds in third place, still just 1.5 games back of the division lead.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAn evening after the Baltimore Orioles pounded out 18 base hits in a 13-5 rout of the Houston Astros, they turn around and allow 18 hits in a 15-8 loss. Ridiculous.It is a good thing when you do something so awesome that it has never been done in the modern era of baseball, right? Something so great that it has not been accomplished in well over 100 years, right? Hitting four home runs before an out is registered is totally amazing, right? You\xe2\x80\x99re going to win a game like that, right?\xc2\xa0 The answers = right, right, right, WRONG!On Friday night the Orioles would get a total of five home runs on 10 hits, scoring eight runs. That should win a vast majority of baseball teams, unless your pitching is awful. And it is.So, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to dump on the pitching here today, but in doing so, let us recall that a tremendous number of games that were decently pitched this year have been lost due to a lack of run support. A number of those sorts of games account for some the O\xe2\x80\x99s nine losses in August.Particularly awful for Baltimore have been the expensive veteran pitchers the Orioles have now accumulated, like Wade Miley and Ubaldo Jimenez \xe2\x80\x93 combining last night for nine runs allowed in 4.2 innings. Here are their combined records and salaries for 2016 (along with Gallardo). You might want to sit down if you are not already doing so.$NameRecordIPERERA$alaryJimenez5-1094.2736.9413.0Gallardo4-483.1485.189.0Miley (O\xe2\x80\x99s)0-217.0189.536.167Total9-16195.01396.4228.167\xc2\xa0That graph is as horrific as it is instructive.Here in this column over the years of publication we have consistently criticized the expense and acquisition of sketchy veteran arms. Young pitchers have been traded away, and these expensive toys become a blocking pattern for development of pitchers within the system. Even so, it is not that Tyler Wilson and Mike Wright have distinguished themselves and seized opportunities. But again, maybe the lack of prior experience is yet a barrier not overcome.Let\xe2\x80\x99s find some silver linings for the Orioles right now: The Blue Jays were beaten yesterday, Chris Tillman is pitching today, and the appearance of the offense breaking out will pay off if it can be sustained.Here at the FanSided Network, we write from the fans\xe2\x80\x99 perspective. We are not beholden to the team or players, risking access by criticisms published. This team may yet win it all, but the flight so far this season is irretrievably memorable for excessive turbulence no matter how glorious the ultimate landing could be.

While the Baltimore Orioles have lived up to their reputation as a homer-happy club, the visiting Houston Astros held their own in that department to even their four-game series at one win apiece. With the clubs combining for 17 blasts in the first two contests, the Astros and Orioles will look to continue to test the limits of Camden Yards when they reconvene on Saturday night. Manny Machado belted a three-run homer in Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s 13-5 triumph before launching a two-run shot the following night in a 15-8 setback to improve to 6-for-19 with three homers, seven RBIs and five runs scored versus Houston this season. While Baltimore fell for the third time in four outings and remained 1 1/2 games behind American League East-leading Toronto, the Astros snapped a five-game skid to move within 5 1/2 games of the Orioles for the second wild-card spot. Jose Altuve homered and drove in five RBIs on Friday to improve to 30-for-73 with 18 runs driven in and 11 scored in August and George Springer also went deep among his four hits. Both stars have struggled versus Saturday starter Chris Tillman, however, as Altuve is 2-for-14 versus the right-hander while Springer is just 2-for-11. TV: 7:05 p.m. ET, ROOT (Houston), WJZ, MASN2 (Baltimore) PITCHING MATCHUP: Astros RH Mike Fiers (8-6, 4.66 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Chris Tillman (15-4, 3.46) After being fortunate to walk away with a win despite allowing three homers, Fiers permitted two more and yielded five runs total in 4 2/3 innings to take the loss at Toronto on Sunday. Homers have been an issue this season for the 31-year-old, who has been taken deep 22 times in 23 appearances (125 2/3 frames). Fiers has also struggled on the road, as his ERA (6.27) is over a run and a half greater than his season total while his 1.61 WHIP and .313 batting average against leave plenty to be desired. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder discomfort was reason enough for the Orioles to keep the 28-year-old from making his scheduled start on Wednesday. Tillman reported no issues throwing off flat ground the following day and is ready to make his first start since Aug. 11, when he allowed two runs on five hits in seven innings of a 9-6 triumph at Oakland. Tillman split his first four career starts versus Houston before settling for a no-decision despite yielding two runs on three hits in seven innings in his last encounter on May 24. WALK-OFFS 1. Baltimore 1B Chris Davis has four homers in his last three games and RF Mark Trumbo has gone deep in back-to-back contests and five of his last eight overall. 2.

After that\xc2\xa0Chris Davis decided that it would be fitting for the Orioles to go back-to-back, and smacked a solo homer of his own. And for good measure,\xc2\xa0Mark Trumbo sent a fourth one over the wall to make MLB history, and to give the Birds a 5-1 lead.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley The Baltimore WireCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireAt that point it appeared the Orioles were off to the races.

But more so when you give up 15 you\xe2\x80\x99re in good shape to lose.So as opposed to the rightful story being how the Orioles made history last night, the story is about the lack of pitching and how most of their runs come off of homers.

08/21/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Glaring issues with instant replay in ...', ""The Baltimore Orioles found themselves on the wrong end of another crooked game. However is there a lesson in this loss for MLB about instant replay?The Baltimore Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t drop another game by a wide margin to Houston because of instant replay last night. In fact, instant replay had nothing to do whatsoever in the outcome of the game or even it\xe2\x80\x99s ebb and flow. It was a total non-issue, if not for the fact that it (that being instant replay) was allowed to run around like a decapitulated chicken during the game.But I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to that in a moment. This game all but got out of control early on, with\xc2\xa0Chris Tillman struggling from the outset. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 2.0 IP, 6 H, 6 R, 5 BB, 0 K. There was some concern that Tillman was still struggling with his shoulder injury, however after the game he said he was fine. He merely struggled with his command, which is something that he freely admitted. So chalk it up as just a poor start.Anything that could have gone wrong for the Orioles last night did \xe2\x80\x93 as evidenced by the fact that\xc2\xa0Ryan Flaherty pitched the ninth inning. If Houston wasn\xe2\x80\x99t scoring on home runs or RBI-doubles, they were scoring on softly hit swinging bunts with the bases loaded. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that, it was a Baltimore chop (again with the bases loaded) forcing in a run. Houston seemingly moved in and made themselves at home at Oriole Park at Camden Yards without the Orioles knowing until it was too late.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley The Baltimore WireCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireIn contrast, when the Orioles did manage to make decent contact with the ball, it was either at a Houston fielder or it was run down by one. Houston seems to have an outfield that\xe2\x80\x99s capable of covering a lot of ground, no matter what the situation. And for an Oriole team that\xe2\x80\x99s used to spraying the ball around the field, that had to be incredibly frustrating. The Orioles did score two lone runs, both off of homers.\xc2\xa0Chris Davis hit a solo shot in the fourth, and\xc2\xa0Steve Pearce followed suit in the eighth.In what was an otherwise dullard of a game, there should be a lesson however for MLB. Houston\xe2\x80\x99s Altuve led off the top of the sixth with what eventually was allowed to stand as a double. His fly ball hit off the top of the outfield wall, and was played on the fly by the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 outfield. Houston manager\xc2\xa0A.J. Hinch eventually went out to inquire about a replay review \xe2\x80\x93 thinking that the ball was a home run.The umpires huddled up and at first appeared to deny the review. Hinch persisted and seemed to refuse to be denied. After awhile, the umpires huddled again and eventually went to the headphones for an apparent replay review. The conversation was quick, and the play stood as a double \xe2\x80\x93 with Hinch still complaining about the decision, while holding an 8-1 lead.We later found out that the discussion was actually more about whether Hinch had waited too long to come out and ask for the challenge. So putting two-and-two together, I suspect that the first protestation was him inquiring about the review, and the second was him trying to convince the umpire to check the rule on how long he can wait to challenge \xe2\x80\x93 which eventually happened. Regardless of the details, the optics didn\xe2\x80\x99t really play well, and in the mean time the Oriole pitcher ended up being frozen in a sense.Buck Showalter came out of the dugout at one point seemingly ready for a fight given the fact that Hinch appeared to be arguing his way into a challenge. However when given the explanation he seemed to accept it. Instant replay is a good thing for baseball; I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that from the beginning, and I still believe that. However it needs to be fine tuned this off season. Far too often, umpires are getting their arms twisted into asking for a crew chief review by politicking managers who have the power of persuasion. That\xe2\x80\x99s not good for instant replay, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for baseball.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerIs it really fair for a game (and/or possibly a season) to hang in the balance by whether or not a skipper can diplomatically persuade an umpire to \xe2\x80\x9cindependently\xe2\x80\x9d review a play? Going back to last night, ironically that play should have had the courtesy of a review by the crew chief since it involved a potential home run. The fact is that it was botched across the board \xe2\x80\x93 by Houston\xe2\x80\x99s manager and by the umpiring crew.The idea is to get the call right. However what we saw last night was a manager who refused to take no for an answer, and the appearance that he had argued his way (twice) into a review. Obviously that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t totally the case, as the umpires called NY to check the rule on how long a manager could wait to ask for instant replay. But in the mean time, the game was delayed for over five minutes.If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to allow for the crew chief to review a play on his own, let\xe2\x80\x99s truly let that be the case. Managers should not be allowed to petition the umpires to review a play \xe2\x80\x9con his own accord.\xe2\x80\x9d So I would submit that moving forward any manager who does this should be ejected. Yes folks, you read that right; if a manager pulls the old\xc2\xa0how about you look at that on your own without me challenging it, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles make history and still manage to loseThe series with Houston concludes this afternoon, as the Birds hope to earn a split.\xc2\xa0Yovani Gallardo will be on the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Houston\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Dallas Keuchel.

The rotation was the biggest thing to worry about with this year\xe2\x80\x99s edition of the team going back to last year, when the team also had a bad rotation. Those worries persisted over the offseason and the O\xe2\x80\x99s have done nothing to make that concern go away.    The 2016 Orioles rotation is somehow even worse than last year\xe2\x80\x99s. How could we have found a rotation with a 4.53 ERA so disappointing? We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how good we had it. If they carried that ERA again this year, they\xe2\x80\x99d be in 10th in starter ERA in the American League - still bad, but not BAD. Instead, entering Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game, they had a 5.00 ERA for the year. Even being aware of how bad they\xe2\x80\x99ve been, it\xe2\x80\x99s still a surprise to look at a number like that as a realization of just how bad it\xe2\x80\x99s been. It\xe2\x80\x99s so bad that I just explained how bad and I still can\xe2\x80\x99t believe how bad it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s not very hard to read between the lines for who long-time baseball writer Peter Gammons blames for this situation:      The '16 Orioles have used 4 starting P not signed or traded for by Andy MacPhail. Those four are 10-16, 5.75\xe2\x80\x94 Peter Gammons (@pgammo) August 21, 2016    The above tweet is wrong, though if corrected, its core point still stands. Gammons seems to have forgotten to count Kevin Gausman, drafted in 2012, the first draft with Dan Duquette at the helm. Add Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 performance to that of Ubaldo Jimenez, Yovani Gallardo, Vance Worley, and Wade Miley, and you come up with a 5.31 ERA for starts made by those gentlemen this year.    Even the two struggling starters who were drafted by MacPhail, Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson, who have combined for a 5.64 ERA, were only pressed into big league duty because of the inadequacy of Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s plan. He\xe2\x80\x99s had long enough to build up the organization so those guys wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be needed. That\xe2\x80\x99s a horrible collective performance, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no getting around that Duquette, as the architect of this unit, deserves a lot of blame for its utter failure. However, if there is some implication that Duquette doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing, or perhaps that he\xe2\x80\x99s only achieved any success because of players he\xe2\x80\x99s inherited from the Andy MacPhail days, that\xe2\x80\x99s just wrong.    I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Gammons is trying to make that implication. I do know that there are plenty of voices within the sphere of Orioles fans who seem to believe that Duquette is some kind of blundering, incompetent doofus. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you have also heard those voices, or at least read their words, more over the span of the current disappointing O\xe2\x80\x99s homestand. Hey, they\xe2\x80\x99re not totally wrong It\xe2\x80\x99s something of an understandable opinion. Gallardo is in August of the first year of a two year deal and has yet to do much to suggest it was a good idea to give up a draft pick to sign him. A whole lot of people would like to see Jimenez on the first train out of town, and even those like me who feel bad for the guy on a human level for all of his struggles aren\xe2\x80\x99t enthused to see him pitch. These two moves have worked out so poorly that you really have to wonder what it is that made Duquette ever believe they could possibly be good ideas.     Then there\xe2\x80\x99s Miley, the \xe2\x80\x9cbig\xe2\x80\x9d trade deadline acquisition. It\xe2\x80\x99s only been four games, but his Friday shenanigans ruining the Orioles historic first run home run party were not a great introduction. Had Miley been merely mediocre (as advertised) instead of astoundingly bad, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are probably just a half game back in the division right now. Baseball fandom is a \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done for me lately?\xe2\x80\x9d kind of thing. Of course it is. What\xe2\x80\x99s happening right now matters more than what happened last year, because fans are living with the consequences right now. The future is also going to be much more influenced by the current trajectory rather than any past events. Still, hitting Duquette with the \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s still MacPhail\xe2\x80\x99s team winning!\xe2\x80\x9d card is not giving him credit for what he has accomplished with the two playoff teams he has overseen, things that would not have happened if MacPhail stuck around. A good 2012 team emerges from nowhere The team that Duquette inherited in that first season, particularly its pitching staff, was a genuine mess. The MacPhail Orioles were basically committed to the continually-failing \xe2\x80\x9ccavalry\xe2\x80\x9d of Jake Arrieta, Zach Britton, Brian Matusz, and Chris Tillman as starters. They also had Jeremy Guthrie and Tommy Hunter kicking around. That first offseason saw Duquette spin Guthrie for Jason Hammel. He signed Wei-Yin Chen for practically peanuts. He stashed Miguel Gonzalez in the minors. He gave himself some options that MacPhail never did. When the young guns again failed to pan out as starters (other than Tillman, eventually,) the Orioles had other choices.    Gonzalez was very good once the Orioles brought him up. Tillman was great at last in the second half. Chen proved to be the league average starter the Orioles always desperately need and, in less successful years, do not find. These allowed the O\xe2\x80\x99s to use less of Hunter, Britton, Arrieta, and Matusz as starters. Duquette even found wild card game hero Joe Saunders late in the season. I have yet to see a convincing reason to believe that the 2012 turnaround, especially the late-season improvement of its pitching staff, would have happened if MacPhail was still the GM of the team. In MacPhail\xe2\x80\x99s last year as GM, he committed about $25 million to Vladimir Guerrero, Derrek Lee, and Kevin Gregg. Two years on, the moves were still bearing fruit Remember when the Orioles won the division? That was awesome. They won that division while having a starting pitcher in 128 of the 162 regular season games who was drafted, signed, or traded for by Duquette. That\xe2\x80\x99s every start that was made by a pitcher other than Tillman. Both of Chen and Gonzalez continued to benefit the Orioles. Gausman stepped into the big league ranks in just his second full professional season and handled himself well. Bud Norris, acquired at the 2013 trade deadline, put things together in his first full year as an Oriole. Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s fingerprints were all over this rotation and all over the pitching staff in general. Did you know that the 2014 O\xe2\x80\x99s only allowed 593 runs over the whole season? The 2016 Orioles still have 39 games left to play and they\xe2\x80\x99ve already allowed 561 runs! That 2014 staff - starters and relievers both - was so good as a unit without having any one great starter.    There are problems with the O\xe2\x80\x99s farm now, but those problems are largely not chickens coming home to roost from the decisions that led to the success of the past four years. Not getting to pick until the third round of the 2014 draft has an impact, but the O\xe2\x80\x99s aren\xe2\x80\x99t feeling that impact at the big league level yet. Looking for the next miracle The man is clearly not King Midas. Not everything that he touches turns to gold. No one bats 1.000 at this.  Duquette has some problematic ideas, like valuing competitive balance draft picks as only bait to dangle for a modest salary dump. His late-offseason pitching signings, which appear to be a deliberate strategy, have not worked out.  There have been trades that have been egregiously misguided, like last year\xe2\x80\x99s acquisitions of Travis Snider and Gerardo Parra, which cost the O\xe2\x80\x99s three pitching prospects, two of whom have pitched in the big leagues this season. The fate of assorted top O\xe2\x80\x99s draft picks - Gausman, Dylan Bundy, Hunter Harvey - leaves one naturally wondering whether the O\xe2\x80\x99s have the right staff in place to develop these guys to be healthy and productive big league pitchers. Same with the fact that Arrieta\xe2\x80\x99s now a Cy Young winner with the Cubs. These things are sources of regular frustration.    Duquette is going to have to pull a rabbit out of his hat to get things going again, or hope that Gallardo and Miley start pitching better, at the very least. The Orioles have a lot of money tied up in those two and Jimenez. They can\xe2\x80\x99t - and given the status of the free agent market coming this offseason, probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t - rely on improving much of the rotation from outside the organization this year. Maybe, in the end, it will turn out that Duquette was best used only as the guy to jump-start a floundering franchise. He has definitely done that. Maybe he will not prove to be the guy who is best for building an organization that can sustain success.  That\xe2\x80\x99s a suspicion that will linger if this year\xe2\x80\x99s O\xe2\x80\x99s fall apart, or even just fall out of a playoff spot, over the last month and a half. The team is, unfortunately, headed in that direction at this moment in time. The season\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing problem with the starting rotation is a big part of why. Duquette has done enough in his tenure that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to have fans practically storming the Warehouse with torches and pitchforks. Or at least, not yet.

The Washington Nationals just finished taking three of four games in Atlanta as they continue to run away with the National League East. The interleague rival Baltimore Orioles are engaged in a much tighter race in the American League East and will try to gain some ground at the expense of the Nationals when they host the opener of a four-game, home-and-home series on Monday. Washington missed out on a four-game sweep of the Braves after a 7-6 loss in 10 innings on Sunday and saw their lead over the Miami Marlins in the NL East slip to 8 1/2 games. The best thing to happen for the Nationals during their current trip (4-3) is Bryce Harper emerging out of a lengthy slump by going 11-for-27 with two home runs and 10 RBIs in the seven games. The Orioles have dropped five of six to open their eight-game homestand and watched the pitching staff surrender an average of 8.3 runs in those six contests. The slide dropped Baltimore 2 1/2 games out of first place in the AL East and leaves it one game ahead of the Seattle Mariners for the second AL wild card. PITCHING MATCHUP: Nationals RH Stephen Strasburg (15-4, 3.59 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Dylan Bundy (6-4, 3.36) Strasburg made it all the way to the All-Star break without suffering a loss but has dropped four of his last six starts, including three in a row. The former No. 1 pick has gotten progressively worse in those last three turns, culminating with a disaster at Colorado on Wednesday in which he was ripped for nine runs on nine hits and three walks in 1 2/3 innings. Strasburg tossed seven scoreless innings at Cleveland on July 27 in his last chance against an AL opponent and is 2-0 with a 3.29 ERA in four interleague starts this season. Bundy had been sharp since moving into the starting rotation before running into the best offense in the league against Boston on Wednesday. The 23-year-old had been moved up a day in the rotation in place of Chris Tillman and was ripped by the Red Sox for five runs and nine hits \xe2\x80\x93 two home runs \xe2\x80\x93 in 4 1/3 innings to suffer a loss. Bundy is getting his first taste of the Beltway Series and is 1-1 with a 2.63 ERA in three interleague games \xe2\x80\x93 two starts. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles LHP T.J. McFarland was held out of a rehab appearance on Sunday and could be activated off the disabled list prior to Monday\xe2\x80\x99s contest. 2. Washington 1B Ryan Zimmerman is 4-for-8 with a homer and three runs scored in two games since coming off the DL. 3. Baltimore RF Mark Trumbo homered in three of the last four games to push his league-leading total to 37.

08/23/2016,"[('What former Oriole could the 2016 O\\u2019s use right now ...', ' The Orioles Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations, Dan Duquette, is known for thinking outside the box. During his time in Baltimore, he has done a lot of great business, including the signings of Nelson Cruz, Nate McLouth and Steve Pearce as well as the trade for Mark Trumbo this past offseason. Of course, there have also been some decisions that came back to bite him; the biggest of which, so far, has been the trading away of eventual Cy Young winner Jake Arrieta. Ugh.    The point is, baseball deals with a lot of unknown factors. Will this guy develop? Is he injury prone? Can he handle the spotlight? Is he a head case? Yada, yada, yada. But what if we wiped all of that away and gave Duquette a fancy time machine (stay with me here). Instead of scouring the waiver wire or trade market, all he had to do was go back in Baltimore history and pluck a former star and plug him right into today\xe2\x80\x99s game. Who should he pick and why? Let\xe2\x80\x99s lay down some ground rules. In this scenario, Duquette can only pick one player. It would be great to round up all the Hall of Famers again, but that defeats the purpose of them adding to this year\xe2\x80\x99s team. It could be someone recent, like Wei-Yin Chen, or someone from the beginning of the team in the 50\xe2\x80\x99s. But, they have to of been Orioles, not St. Louis Browns. As great as George Sisler was, according to Baseball Reference, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to consider him. OK, hopefully that all makes sense. Here now are some of my picks for players that would add the most to the 2016 Orioles in no particular order. Remember, these are all independent of one another. Tell us your pick of these guys or others throughout history in the comments section.    Jim Palmer, RHP The tall, lanky, pitcher-turned-broadcaster is the obvious choice for this Orioles team. As a group, the starters have a 4.97 ERA, which puts them at 26th in MLB. Palmer\xe2\x80\x99s career 2.86 ERA would look pretty great in place of someone like Wade Miley. Not to mention Cakes was a horse, averaging 249 innings per 162-game season. Simply put, he is the best pitcher in team history and would be a welcome addition.    Mike Mussina, RHP If we look at statistics, Moose was not as dominant as Palmer, who came a generation before him. And his stand-offish demeanor may not have earned him many fans along the way, but this guy was a phenomenal pitcher. The righty\xe2\x80\x99s career 3.68 ERA doesn\xe2\x80\x99t scream \xe2\x80\x9cincredible\xe2\x80\x9d, but his career 123 ERA+ is just two points lower than the Hall-of-Famer Palmer. And you have to remember that Mussina pitched through the entire \xe2\x80\x9cSteroid Era\xe2\x80\x9d, which may have inflated his numbers some. Slot him in against today\xe2\x80\x99s offenses and he would be an impact arm again. Eddie Murray, 1B Chris Davis has not been a bad first baseman this year, but he could stand to be a lot better. Murray was one of the best at the position in baseball history and he had his best years in Baltimore. While an Oriole, he slashed .294/.370/.498 and had a 56.3 WAR over 13 seasons and played Gold Glove defense. Murray\xe2\x80\x99s addition would lengthen the lineup and take some pressure off of Crush, who moves to DH in this scenario.    Brady Anderson, OF Man, that 1996 season! A slash line of .297/.396/.637 with 50 home runs and 110 RBI? Yeah, that would slot in somewhere on this team. As would Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s overall athleticism, which is something the Orioles seem to lack at times. Although manager Buck Showalter may not use it much, Brady was a good base stealer, leading Orioles history with 507 swiped bags. Adam Jones probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let the center field spot slipe, but Anderson is a team player. He takes over for either Hyun Soo Kim in left or Trumbo in right to provide better defense. Melvin Mora, UTL I grew up in the dark ages of Orioles baseball. They made the playoffs in 1997, when I was four years old and not paying attention to baseball yet, and then never made it again until 2012, when I was a sophomore in college. During that stretch, Mora was one of my favorites, so this is a bit of a homer pick, but if this was the 2004-version of Mora, he would be quite the addition. That year, he slashed .340/.419/.562 with 27 home runs and 104 RBI. While he eventually became exclusively a third baseman, he had the ability to play all over the field. If he was the pick, the O\xe2\x80\x99s would send Ryan Flaherty back to Norfolk and use Mora as the everyday utility man. Jake Arrieta, RHP It\xe2\x80\x99s not meant to twist the knife anymore, but the modern version of Arrieta would be PERFECT for this 2016 squad. While he has not been quite as dominant this season as he was last summer, he is still pretty darn great. That 2.75 ERA, 15-5 record and 147 ERA+ is going to earn him some Cy Young consideration again. Meanwhile, the O\xe2\x80\x99s rotation is a mess. The advantage that Arrieta has over Palmer or Mussina is that he is performing right now, in this era. Would Moose or Cakes translate from their time? I think they would, but it is open for discussion. The problem, he stunk as an Oriole and returning to Baltimore may cause him issues.    The verdict If I had to pick just one guy from O\xe2\x80\x99s history, I\xe2\x80\x99m going with Palmer by a good margin. Judging based off of both stats and how he speaks during MASN broadcasts, the guy knows pitching inside and out. His game is as much cerebral as it is physical and that would be a nice addition to both the field and the clubhouse, teaching a guy like Dylan Bundy the nuances of the game. I\xe2\x80\x99m for Cakes all the way. Of course, I left off legends like Frank Robinson, Cal Ripken Jr. and Brooks Robinson. My reasoning: they didn\xe2\x80\x99t fill a need as much as others, and this would have been a boring article if all I did was list the Hall-of-Famers for you. However, you can certainly pick them if you so choose. Thanks for reading! Who would be your pick? As mentioned before, it can be one of the players listed above or any other Oriole in history that you prefer. Let us know in the comments or on Twitter and Facebook.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

"", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles swat Nats, 10-8, in a wild one - Camden Chat', ' The Orioles going into tonight were looking for that ever vaunted ""winning streak."" As the impeding doom of Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s trip to the disabled list dropped today Orioles fans had to put their faith in Wade Miley tonight. Miley, as you probably know, has struggled since being acquired in July. As an Oriole he had given up more hits and more runs than innings pitched coming into the night. That\xe2\x80\x99s bad. Well, the Orioles are going to need some surprises down the stretch and they pretty much need Miley to be one of those surprises.    The Orioles faced off against Tanner Roark and the ""rival"" Washington Nationals. The scoring got started early. First batter of the game Adam Jones smashed a ball to the right center field gap that Trea Turner made a spectacular running/diving catch to rob Jones of extra bases. The next batter, Hyun Soo Kim, lined a single down the left field line. That brought Manny Machado to the plate and he walloped a 452 home run into the left center field stands. 2-0, Orioles. Chris Davis then doubled to left center field which was followed by a Mark Trumbo walk. Then a weird sequence of back to back hit by pitches for Jonathan Schoop and Matt Wieters scored another run and left the bases loaded for J.J. Hardy. 3-0, Orioles. With still only one out recorded Hardy got a sacrifice fly to center field scoring Trumbo from third. 4-0, Orioles. With runners on second and third and now two down the Orioles still had a chance to score runs...sort of. The senior circuit brand of baseball calls for pitchers to hit, which is trash. Miley, batting before he even threw a pitch, grounded out ending the rally. A good start for the Orioles offense off a good pitcher in Roark.    The bottom of the first inning began with horror visions of Miley\xe2\x80\x99s last start against the Astros. Trea Turner led off with a single, something he would continue to do in this game, then Jayson Werth was hit by a pitch bringing up one of the NL\xe2\x80\x99s best hitters, Daniel Murphy. Miley had appeared to have minimized the damage with a Murphy ground out to first base. But, as Davis threw to second to get the out Miley did not cover the bag so the double play could not be completed.    Miley was able to strike out Bryce Harper, so with two down and runners on the corners Anthony Rendon doubled down the left field line scoring one run. 4-1, Orioles. However, Murphy was inexplicably sent home on the play and was out by 30 feet. Thanks for the extra outs. Miley wriggled out of something that could have gone much worse. The Orioles would lead off the second with more hard hit balls against Roark. Jones singled on a hard hit ball to third base which Rendon bobbled then airmailed to first base allowing Jones to advance to second base. With one down, Machado singled to center field allowing Jones to score. 5-1, Orioles. With two down, Trumbo was hit by a pitch. But, Jonathan Schoop struck out.    Not much happened from there until the fifth inning. Miley mostly kept the Nats quiet and Roark stranded one runner in the third inning, one in the fourth inning, and two in fifth inning. Koda Glover came on in the sixth inning and he stranded two more Orioles runners. Miley would give up one more run in the bottom of the fifth inning on a Danny Espinosa line drive solo home run to left field. 5-2, Orioles. Miley would come back out for the sixth with two left handed hitters due up. Murphy singled and Harper hit a grounder that Davis booted allowing Murphy to advance to third base. Then on Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s ill advised throw to third base Harper took second. Runners on second and third and none down and the tying run at the plate. In came Mychal Givens to put out the fire. Givens struck out Rendon, popped up Wilson Ramos, and struck out Ryan Zimmerman. He did all that on eleven (11!!!) pitches. No runs scored. Exhale. Givens would come back out for the seventh inning and it did not go as well. With one down Ben Revere doubled to left center field which brought up apparent baseballing God Trea Turner who singled...AGAIN. Runners on the corners with one down. Givens got Jayson Werth to pop out. With two down, Buck Showalter called on rookie lefty Donnie Hart to get the two big lefites, Murphy and Harper. Murphy would flare a single into shallow right to score one run. 5-3, Orioles. Harper and Hart battled, but Hart got him to strike out on a 3-2 pitch to minimize the damage and escape the inning with the lead. Exhale again.    The Orioles offense would alleviate our collective anxiety in the top of the eighth inning adding on five runs against Blake Treinen on a Kim double, Machado RBI single, Trumbo Walk, Schoop RBI single, and Matt Wieters three run home run. 10-3, Orioles. In an effort to make the game interesting and give Baltimore heart palpitations, the Nationals mounted a rally in the bottom of the ninth inning. Back to back singles and a one out walk loaded the bases for Murphy who smashed a grand slam. 10-7, Orioles. I hope Parker Bridwell likes Bowie/Norfolk. Zach Britton came on with one down and ended his scoreless appearance streak by giving up a single to Harper and a long RBI double to Rendon. 10-8, Orioles. Wilson Ramos would then ground a ball back to Britton who for some reason tried for the out at second and missed. So, now Zimmerman is up as the winning run at the plate. What just happened? I can\xe2\x80\x99t breathe again. Anyways, Zimmerman hit a sharp grounder to Schoop who flipped to Hardy who threw to Davis for the 4-6-3 double play. Game over.

The Washington Nationals did not have much success against their Beltway Series rival on the road but will get another chance in their own building when the Baltimore Orioles visit to begin the second half of the home-and-home set on Wednesday. The Orioles are fighting off a challenge for the second American League wild card spot as they open a five-game road trip. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s playoff hopes hit a snag on Tuesday despite the 8-1 win, when it was announced that ace Chris Tillman will be placed on the 15-day disabled list due to shoulder inflammation. The Orioles are 20-6 when Tillman starts but have been encouraged this week by strong outings from young right-handers Dylan Bundy and Kevin Gausman, both of whom will be leaned on to make up for the ace\xe2\x80\x99s loss. The Nationals are suddenly losers of three games in a row but remain eight games clear of the Miami Marlins in the Nationals League East. Washington has some experience in losing an ace after placing Stephen Strasburg on the DL earlier this week but has the luxury of other starters like Tanner Roark, who will go for his 14th win on Wednesday. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles LH Wade Miley (7-10, 5.58 ERA) vs. Nationals RH Tanner Roark (13-6, 2.87) An uptick in performance from Miley would help cover the loss of Tillman as well, but the veteran has been hit hard in four starts since arriving in a trade from the Seattle Mariners. The Louisiana native is 0-2 with a 9.53 ERA in those four turns and is coming off the worst of the bunch after getting hammered for six runs on as many hits in 1 2/3 innings against Houston on Friday. Miley faced Washington once last season as a member of the Boston Red Sox and was lit up for seven runs in 2 1/3 innings. Roark is enjoying a string of five straight quality starts and won the first four in that stretch before settling for a no decision at Atlanta on Friday. The Illinois product allowed three runs on four hits \xe2\x80\x93 two homers \xe2\x80\x93 over 6 1/3 innings against the Braves in a game the Nationals went on to win. Roark is looking for his first win in the Beltway Series and is 0-2 with a 6.75 ERA in three games \xe2\x80\x93 two starts \xe2\x80\x93 against Baltimore. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles LF Mark Trumbo snapped a string of seven straight hits going over the fence when he recorded a pair of singles on Tuesday. 2. Washington C Wilson Ramos is enduring a 1-for-17 slump over the last four games. 3. Baltimore 1B Chris Davis reached 30 home runs for the fourth time in five seasons on Tuesday.

08/25/2016,"[(""Baltimore Orioles: Can you root for the O's and the ..."", ""Is it right or wrong to have two teams? Can fans of the mid-Atlantic region justifiably root for both the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals?The Baltimore Orioles haven\xe2\x80\x99t been alone in the mid-Atlantic region since 2005 when the Washington Nationals moved into the area. One year later, the two teams began playing the \xe2\x80\x9cBattle of the Beltways\xe2\x80\x9d each year. At first each team would visit the other over a three-game weekend series. However of late MLB has gone to a format in which each team visits the other twice over a four-day span \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s true of all regional rivalries now.If you go to New York, you\xe2\x80\x99re either a Yankees or Mets fan. The same is true in Chicago with the ChiSox and Cubs, as well as in Los Angeles with the Angels and Dodgers. Neither side seems to really care for the other, however what they both do seem to agree on is that \xe2\x80\x9chybrid fans\xe2\x80\x9d who claim to love both teams are\xc2\xa0personae non gratae. In other words, you have to pick one!As I look\xc2\xa0down over Nationals Park to ready myself for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game, it dawns on me that the series between the Orioles and Washington isn\xe2\x80\x99t as comparable to those others as one might think. All of those rivalries are in the same city as opposed to Baltimore and Washington being two distinct cities with distinct cultures. Granted the two parks are separated by only about 30 miles, but they\xe2\x80\x99re vastly different places.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley The Baltimore WireCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireBut the idea here isn\xe2\x80\x99t to talk about what makes the cities and teams different or the same. But unlike in the aforementioned places, we do see folks at Beltway Series games with the split hats/shirts, or the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 shirt and Washington hat. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t something you\xe2\x80\x99d ever see in NY or Chicago, but we see it here. Is that okay?Like the region it seems, my answer is split\xe2\x80\xa6! Or rather, let\xe2\x80\x99s say there\xe2\x80\x99s a qualifier on the first part. It is in fact \xe2\x80\x9cokay\xe2\x80\x9d to feel that way and to root for both teams with equal fervor,\xc2\xa0if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you have to do to stay into baseball. The whole idea if for the sport itself to continue to thrive as America\xe2\x80\x99s pastime. So if split loyalties are what you have to do to stay focused on the game, go for it.However in reality, I would argue that it\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0NOT\xc2\xa0okay. You pick one team as a kid or whenever you start following a sport. Now if another team moves closer to where you live or something along those lines, I would say that it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to cease rooting for the one team and start rooting for the other. Does that mean you can\xe2\x80\x99t follow the first team at all? Not necessarily \xe2\x80\x93 but the point is that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be with the same fervor. (Incidentally, for the most part I\xe2\x80\x99m not into people thinking it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to even cease being a fan of a team for one reason or another. But a team moving closer to you is one exception to that.)\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerIn Washington\xe2\x80\x99s case, there are a lot of Orioles fans due in part to the fact that DC went 34 years without a team. However there\xe2\x80\x99s also the proximity factor as well. But I would argue that it goes well beyond just the Orioles. I\xe2\x80\x99ve met lots of people in the DC area who grew up rooting for other teams all together (Red Sox, Yankees, Cubs, etc), but who now claim they still have that initial loyalty \xe2\x80\x93 while having the same amount of loyalty to the Nationals. Again, whatever makes you happy I suppose. But you\xe2\x80\x99d never see this in places like NY or Chicago. Fans on both sides would gang up on someone with a split shirt or cap!Incidentally, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a reflection on Washington fans or anything along those lines \xe2\x80\x93 I can already see the throngs of seething Nationals fans lining up to complain about a Baltimore writer targeting them. There\xe2\x80\x99s still a novelty of sorts with baseball in DC. The kids who are growing up going to Nationals Park now are the ones who will carry that tradition onward. The city didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a team for a long time \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s natural that it would be tough for people to figure out what they want to do at a certain point.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles hold on for dear life to earn a curly W in DCThe Orioles were Washington\xe2\x80\x99s de facto team for some time. But if you grew up a Cubs fan, it might be hard to shove that aside and start rooting for the Nats. Nevertheless, the point is that as opposed to saying\xc2\xa0since I like both teams equally I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be happy no matter who wins\xe2\x80\xa6yay!, you should pick one team and stick with them.

Washington has lost three in a row to Baltimore this week and six of its past nine overall.Despite that, the Nationals still lead the NL East by seven games over the Miami Marlins, and the almost-comeback had manager Dusty Baker feeling better in spite of another defeat.""The thing I\'m proud of my team about is we lost the game, but I mean they showed a lot of fight,"" Baker said. ""If you keep fighting like that, you\'re going to win a lot of ballgames. I mentioned to some of the guys, good teams got to come back. And come back we did.""Trailing 10-3 going into the bottom of the ninth, the Nationals got singles from Danny Espinosa and pinch-hitter Clint Robinson, and a walk to Jayson Werth set up  Murphy\'s 24th home run of the season, the grand slam off Parker Bridwell.""Great at-bats in front of me,"" Murphy said. ""J.W .works a great at bat, Clint comes off the bench, hits a bullet and I got a pitch in the middle of the plate. Fortunately I didn\'t miss it.""Murphy\'s grand slam forced the Orioles to turn to closer Zach Britton, who was on a streak of 43 consecutive appearances without giving up an earned run. That ended when Bryce Harper singled and Anthony Rendon drove him in with an RBI double, the first run Britton gave up since April 30.Britton got Ryan Zimmerman to ground into a game-ending double play, making Washington starter Tanner Roark (13-7) lament his rough start. Roark said he wasn\'t at his best in giving up five runs, four earned, on seven hits in five-plus innings.Roark hit three of the first 14 batters he faced and allowed a two-run home run to Manny Machado before settling down.""He\'s usually not as erratic as he was tonight,"" Zimmerman said. ""He can\'t be great every single time. He did battle. Kept us in the game for five innings. That\'s kind of typical of Tanner.

And in saying that, I mean people thought it would be a beat down. JImenez obviously has struggled this year, so perhaps people thought that with good reason.The Birds did end up falling last night.

Werth being a great hitter, jumped on that and smacked it over the wall giving Washington a 1-0 lead.But I can\xe2\x80\x99t stress enough that Ubaldo Jimenez was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 best chance to win last night\xe2\x80\x99s game.

08/27/2016,"[('Orioles play a disaster of a baseball game, lose to ...', ' Each time you might think that things are as bad as they could possibly get with the Orioles, they dynamite open a hole in the floor to show that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot farther they could still fall. They fell a little farther in another disaster of a game on Saturday afternoon, being laughed out of Yankee Stadium in a 13-5 loss.    Maybe there aren\xe2\x80\x99t must-win games in late August but the Orioles surely needed this one all the same, with the teams above them in the AL East starting to creep away and the teams below them in the wild card, including these same Yankees, creeping up on them from below.  A homer-prone rookie was starting for the Yankees and Dylan Bundy was starting for the Orioles. More importantly, tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s game can already be written off as a loss with Kevin Gausman pitching on the road. Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game is one the Orioles could have won, should have won, and needed to win. Instead... Well, look, it was horrible. And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, the word \xe2\x80\x9chorrible\xe2\x80\x9d is thrown around a lot, including by myself, when it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not that severe of a situation. So I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for exaggerating in the past. But this was horrible.     Like \xe2\x80\x9cgiving up a home run to Aaron Hicks\xe2\x80\x9d horrible. \xe2\x80\x9cBlowing a double steal to let a run score\xe2\x80\x9d horrible. \xe2\x80\x9cMychal Givens had to pitch in the fifth inning\xe2\x80\x9d horrible. \xe2\x80\x9cMatt Wieters doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to call pitches on an 0-2 count\xe2\x80\x9d horrible.    Jim Palmer - who is not at all horrible - has run out of patience with several Orioles, including Wieters. Palmer wondered, repeatedly, why there were so many high fastballs being called on two-strike counts when Bundy was fooling Yankees batters with his breaking pitches. Why, indeed? Palmer also repeatedly referenced the fact that T.J. McFarland was rushed back to the big leagues in desperation, despite his minor league rehab not going particularly well, all for the Orioles to, hopefully, get a few innings out of him. Bundy only pitched four innings, for a variety of reasons, some of which weren\xe2\x80\x99t his fault, and then McFarland was called upon.    And by the way, McFarland was not called upon in a lost cause of a game. Bundy gave up five runs in four innings, true, which sure isn\xe2\x80\x99t great, and is enough to get us all wondering and worrying if the O\xe2\x80\x99s are hurting Bundy with this late-season use.  But by the time McFarland stepped onto the mound, the Orioles were \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d losing 5-4, thanks to two Chris Davis home runs and a Mark Trumbo home run. The Orioles are never out of a game where their pitching staff can keep them remotely close! That\xe2\x80\x99s the trick, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it. So, McFarland. Look, Palmer said it all already. McFarland got rushed here and maybe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong here. He definitely gave up two home runs in the span of facing six batters in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game, and was generally so pathetic that despite the fact that the Orioles desperately needed multiple innings from McFarland, just to eat the innings and move on, he was so bad that Buck Showalter was forced to pull him from the game. The Orioles trailed 9-4 by the time he left.    This is a cascading failure for the Orioles. Now Givens was forced to be deployed in the fifth inning, and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good today either, so he threw 28 pitches and only got one out, which will affect him for the rest of the series (if the Orioles should happen to have a lead) and beyond.  Donnie Hart was also needed in the game, before the sixth inning even finished, for 36 pitches. Brad Brach had to pitch for more than an inning in a game where he entered with the Orioles trailing by eight runs. The \xe2\x80\x9clong\xe2\x80\x9d reliever revolving door will surely keep spinning another day. In short, the Orioles are riding the disaster bus right now.         The Orioles disaster bus Mark Brown / Camden Chat   The Orioles have now given up at least 12 runs in four of their last nine games. They have given up 139 runs in 25 August games - 5.56 runs allowed per game. Their starting pitcher ERA is now over 5.00 for the season. The bullpen ERA, once a strength of the team, is now closer to 4 than it is to 3. They have three players with 30+ home runs and this fact almost doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even matter. We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the East and second place. Jones and Tillman and O\xe2\x80\x99Day fell there. First place went 11 days ago. The home runs are over the wall in right field.

""That\'s my fault and I got to get better next time.""A day after a 14-4 trouncing in which Yovani Gallardo lasted only 1 1/3 innings in the shortest start of his 10-year career, Bundy also came out early.""He\'s pitched well and just could never really get into that rhythm,"" Showalter said.Orioles relievers T.J.

An early strength of the team, the bullpen has struggled of late, allowing 23 runs over the last four games.""That\'s what happens,"" Showalter said. ""That\'s why they call it dog days of August. It happens to pitchers, hitters, everybody.""The homers by Davis and Trumbo brought Baltimore\'s season total to 202 in 129 games, the fifth consecutive season with at least 200 homers. The 129 games needed to reach the mark are the second-fewest to reach 200 home runs in Orioles history, STATS said.Yankees rookie Gary Sanchez homered for the 11th time in 21 games this season. Starlin Castro and Aaron Hicks also connected.New York had 18 hits and drew seven walks on the afternoon, but despite all that offensive output, it was a disputed play on the bases that put them ahead for good.After Davis\' first homer gave the Orioles a 2-1 lead in the third, two-out singles by Teixeira, Didi Gregorius and Castro brought home the tying run.With runners at the corners, Castro broke for second. Catcher Matt Wieters\' throw was then cut off by shortstop J.J. Hardy as Gregorius tried to steal home.Hardy\'s throw appeared to be in time, but Gregorius neatly tucked in his right arm and extended his left arm across home plate.Umpire Ron Kulpa called Gregorius out, but the Yankees challenged and the ruling was overturned. After the review, Brian McCann hit an RBI double for a 4-2 lead.""I thought I probably missed on the first hand,"" Wieters said. ""It was close on the first hand before he pulled it back. And then I knew I got him on the chest area, but didn\'t know if he got his right hand in in time. It was close and it didn\'t go our way.""TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: CF Adam Jones was held out of the lineup after aggravating his hamstring injury on Friday. He tried to talk his way into starting, Showalter said.UP NEXTOrioles: RHP Kevin Gausman (5-10, 3.92 ERA) is set to make his fourth start this season against the Yankees. He\'s 0-1 in the previous three outings despite a 1.31 ERA.Yankees: LHP CC Sabathia (8-10, 4.33) was originally scheduled to pitch Monday in Kansas City. But Girardi made a switch, starting Sabathia instead of RHP Michael Pineda. Girardi cited Baltimore\'s better numbers against right-handed pitching and the Royals\' success vs. lefties.JERSEY BOYOrioles All-Star reliever Brad Brach will be inducted into the Monmouth University Athletics Hall of Fame in December. He will join Miles Austin III (football) as the newest members of the 2016 class. A native of Freehold, New Jersey, Brach remains the school\'s all-time leader in wins (29), strikeouts (277), and innings pitched (324 1-3).

(AP Photo/Kathy Willens)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORENEW YORK (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 In the thick of the AL playoff races, the Baltimore Orioles lost a key player at an inopportune time.Star center fielder Adam Jones left Friday\'s game at Yankee Stadium in the second inning with a left hamstring strain. Although the seriousness of the injury was downplayed by his manager and the five-time All-Star himself, it\'s unclear if this could be a lingering problem that could haunt his club down the stretch.""See where we are tomorrow,"" Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. ""It\'s not a DL thing. I think we\'re still in pretty good shape.""Rookie Gary Sanchez homered for the eighth time in nine games and drove in four runs as the New York Yankees beat the Orioles 14-4 in the opener of their weekend series.Jones was in the starting lineup despite leaving Thursday\'s game in Washington with hamstring cramps. He hustled down the line but was thrown out on a soft grounder to third in his only at-bat on Friday night.""I felt fine. It\'s just the first true test comes when you hit an infield ground ball and first instinct is to try and beat it out,"" Jones said. ""Probably not the smartest thing to do.""Mark Teixeira and Chase Headley also went deep for the surging Yankees, who moved five games over .500 for the first time this season. New York is now 3 1/2 games behind the Orioles for the second AL wild card.Sanchez, who had three hits, had a two-out single in the bottom of the first. Teixeira followed with a towering shot into the right-field bleachers off Yovani Gallardo to give New York a 2-1 lead.The Yankees broke the game open against Gallardo (4-6) with a six-run second. The right-hander was charged with eight runs over 1 1/3 innings, the shortest start of his 10-year career.Luis Cessa (4-0) gave up three runs and five hits over six innings in his second big-league start.Manny Machado homered twice for the Orioles, giving him 31 for the season. Along with Mark Trumbo (38) and Chris Davis (30), it marks the first time in franchise history the Orioles have three players with 30 homers before September.Headley singled and Aaron Judge walked to start the second inning. Ronald Torreyes lifted a fly ball to left-center field but a charging Nolan Reimold could not glove the ball cleanly, loading the bases. The veteran Reimold, who had played 12 career games in center prior to Friday, had just replaced Jones in the field to start the inning.""It just sucks that I feel like I let my team down, putting Nolan in a peculiar situation,"" Jones said.  ""Just try and get this correct and make that big push because at this point in time in the season, missing more than a few games would hurt this team.""Brett Gardner followed with a single to left that drove in Headley and a sliding Judge to give the Yankees a 4-1 lead. Jacoby Ellsbury singled to right, scoring Torreyes for New York\'s fifth run.Sanchez, hitting .541 with eight homers and 14 RBIs over his last 10 games, chased Gallardo with a two-run double to right that made it 7-1.""He continues to just swing the bat extremely well and he seems to center every baseball he hits,"" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ""He\'s patient. He gets his pitch and he\'s not missing it right now.""Teixiera capped the scoring in the big inning with an RBI single off reliever Vance Worley for his third RBI of the game.Headley\'s two-run homer in the fourth pushed the Yankees lead to 10-1, and Sanchez clubbed a two-run shot in the next inning for his 10th homer in 20 games this season.Machado, who gave the Orioles the lead in the first, hit his second of the game into the right-field seats in the sixth to make it 12-3 with his ninth career multi-homer game.Torreyes and Gardner both had RBI hits in the seventh.Yankees right-hander Ben Heller pitched a scoreless eighth in his major league debut.BRONX BLUESBaltimore has lost each of their last 11 series openers at Yankee Stadium, dating back to the start of the 2013.TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: RHP Chris Tillman (right shoulder bursitis) is scheduled to throw on flat ground Tuesday.Yankees: C Brian McCann was not with the team due to the death of his grandmother.UP NEXTOrioles: Rookie RHP Dylan Bundy (7-4, 3.33 ERA) attempts to win for the fifth time this month.Yankees: RHP Chad Green (2-3, 3.66 ERA) has struck out 16 batters in 12 innings over his last two starts, allowing just one run over that span.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

If he ends up hitting the DL are the Orioles done/The Baltimore Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t just lose to New York last night in grandiose fashion, they might have lost Adam Jones for a span of time. While the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t officially have a captain per se, Jones fills that role in every sense of the term \xe2\x80\x93 call it in a de facto manner. He came out of Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s game in Washington with leg cramps, and then exited last night with a hamstring strain after trying to leg out an infield hit in the first inning.More on Jones in a moment, but that acted as a harbinger of sorts for the O\xe2\x80\x99s with regard to the game in the Bronx. Yovani Gallardo never got anything going on the mound, which made for a quick exit. Gallardo\xe2\x80\x99s line: 1.1 IP, 6 H, 8 R (7 earned), 1 BB, 0 K. Gallardo left too many pitches in the middle of the plate, and New York took advantage.The Orioles did have an early 1-0 lead after Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x98s solo homer in the first inning. But in the bottom of the first Teixeira gave NY a 2-1 lead with a two-run shot, and they never looked back. In the second inning they put six runs on the board, chasing Gallardo in the process. And it came on a barrage of hits. All in all, New York managed to have nine consecutive batters reach base. From the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 perspective, that\xe2\x80\x99s never good.

Machado would smack a second home run (of the two-run variety) in the sixth, and the Birds would put one more run on the board in the ninth thanks to Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single. However if you\xe2\x80\x99re into teaching good baseball fundamentals, I hope you sent your kids to bed early last night!And these games will happen over the course of the season. The Orioles have had them occur in their favor and against them. However they do need to realize that they\xe2\x80\x99re now in a dog fight not only for the AL East title, but for a play off spot in general. They\xe2\x80\x99re currently in the second wild car spot, however Detroit is only one game behind. Furthermore, New York is quickly moving up in the standings. It would be quite a coup de grace for this Oriole team to be overtaken by their AL East rivals and to watch them go to the postseason after they basically threw in the towel and \xe2\x80\x9csold\xe2\x80\x9d at the deadline.But if Adam Jones is out for any considerable amount of time, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to make the road all the more difficult. This is an Oriole team that\xe2\x80\x99s already without the likes of Rickard, Tillman, and O\xe2\x80\x99Day. Losing the heart and soul of the franchise would just make the road all the more tough. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long Jones will be out, however the prevailing sentiment right now is that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to the DL.

I feel like I let my team down. Put Nolan in a peculiar situation. Just put people in situations that they\xe2\x80\x99re not familiar with. Let\xe2\x80\x99s try and get this correct and make that big push. At this point and time in the season, missing more than a few games would hurt this team.I get what Jones is trying to say in that he knows he\xe2\x80\x99s a team leader and that he needs to be on the field. However first off his hamstring supposedly felt fine before the game \xe2\x80\x93 so there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have played. He seemed to aggravate trying to leg out an infield hit. So\xe2\x80\xa6would Orioles fans prefer he not hustle? Taking accountability is in my view Jones\xe2\x80\x99 most admirable quality, and one that to be quite frank I try to emulate in my own life. But injuries like these happen \xe2\x80\x93 nothing he could have done to prevent it.But the Birds have always been a next man up type of team under Showalter. So that means that someone has to step up big starting today. And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the skipper many times, other teams (such as Toronto, Boston, Detroit, and yes New York) aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to feel badly for the injury problems you have. They\xe2\x80\x99re just going to be glad you have them. Next: Baltimore Orioles fans: Max Scherzer says be quiet if you come out at allThe series continues this afternoon at Yankee Stadium. Dylan Bundy will be on the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by NY\xe2\x80\x99s Chad Green. Game time is set for just after 1 PM. "", 'birdswatcher.com')]"

He will regress into the promising player he was assumed to be when the Yankees called him up this month, rather than the dominant force he has become since joining them. Sanchez will, most likely, stop hitting like Barry Bonds in pinstripes.That day, however, has not come just yet. Instead, Sanchez, 23, remains on his torrid streak. His debut month has been one for history, and it only got better Saturday. He hit another home run, his 11th this month, in the fourth inning of the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 13-5 home victory over the Baltimore Orioles.Unlike his previous home runs, it was no moonshot, just a defensive swing with two strikes that sent a 94-mile-per-hour fastball from Dylan Bundy skimming over the right-field wall. It was one of six homers in the game, but the only one to bring on a curtain call, with the fans at Yankee Stadium chanting Sanchez\xe2\x80\x99s name for a second straight day.It continued a remarkable stretch for Sanchez, and the Yankees. After going without a home run in his first 27 major league plate appearances this year, he has hit 11 in his last 63 appearances and nine in his last 10 games. He now has more homers with the Yankees than he hit in four months in Class AAA, and he has reached that total faster than any player in major league history.

They have scored 27 runs in two games against the Orioles and piled up 18 hits in each one. Starlin Castro had four hits, including his 18th homer of the year, and three runs batted in.Their victory over their American League East rivals lifted the Yankees to two and a half games behind Baltimore for the final A.L. postseason spot, though they were separated by two other teams. The Yankees are a season-high six games over .500 and have been on an upswing since completing three major deals before the trade deadline that were widely perceived as a decision to put aside serious playoff hopes for 2016 and look to rebuilding for the future.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you think when they trade Beltran, Miller and Chapman,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad Green, the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 starting pitcher Saturday, said of Carlos Beltran, Andrew Miller and Aroldis Chapman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think they\xe2\x80\x99re giving up, but we still have great players in here.\xe2\x80\x9d Sign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

He signed with the Yankees at age 16 out of the Dominican Republic, earning a $3 million signing bonus that was then the largest the Yankees had ever paid to an amateur international free agent.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  He was one of the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 top prospects entering this year, and a top-100 talent among minor league systems across the sport, according to scouting publications. Although he made his debut in the majors on the second-to-last day of the 2015 season, he did not gain a starting job until the organization promoted him on Aug. 2. Since then, he has been a challenging matchup for opposing pitchers.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Still, the Yankees have seen this before, or at least a close approximation. Twenty-six years ago, Kevin Maas made his debut for the club and hit 10 homers in his first 79 at-bats. Buck Showalter, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 manager and a coach on the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 staff in 1990, thought of him Friday night as he watched Sanchez.\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened to Kevin?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked before the game Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did that work out?\xe2\x80\x9dMaas turned out to be a supernova. He was promoted to the Yankees at 25 and never played a game in the majors after 30. He hit just 55 more homers, and his career wound down with stops in the minor leagues and in Japan.Sanchez, however, comes with a more significant pedigree. While his power is evident, his defensive skills as a catcher and his strong arm \xe2\x80\x94 he has thrown out six of the nine base runners who have tried to steal on his watch \xe2\x80\x94 have drawn praise from, among others, Showalter, who also warned against placing high expectations on a young player.

The Baltimore Orioles have dropped off the pace in the American League East, but they have a chance to quickly make up ground when they host the division-leading Toronto Blue Jays on Monday in the opener of a three-game series. Baltimore salvaged the finale of a three-game set at the New York Yankees on Sunday to remain three games behind Toronto. The Orioles were stomped by a combined 27-9 in the first two games at New York before halting a three-game skid with a 5-0 victory Sunday, getting a pair of homers to push their total to a major league-best 204. Mark Trumbo has gone deep in back-to-back games and tops the majors with 40 homers, but he has yet to connect in 13 games against the Blue Jays this season. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s pitching staff will be tested by a Toronto offense that produced 32 runs and nine homers in a three-game sweep of the Minnesota Twins. Reigning AL MVP Josh Donaldson put on a show against the Twins, going 6-for-10 with four homers, nine RBIs and six runs scored. TV: 7:05 p.m. ET, TVA Sports MASN (Baltimore) PITCHING MATCHUP: Blue Jays RH Marco Estrada (7-6, 3.47 ERA) vs. Orioles LH Wade Miley (8-10, 5.51) Estrada\xe2\x80\x99s ERA has jumped up by more than half a run in his last two starts after he was shelled for six runs on 10 hits over five innings in a loss to the Los Angeles Angels on Wednesday. He served up three homers over four innings in a no-decision versus the Yankees in his previous turn and has surrendered six blasts during a three-start stretch. He is 1-0 with a 3.71 ERA in three starts versus Baltimore this season. Miley earned his first victory in five starts since he was acquired by Seattle at the trade deadline, giving up a pair of runs over five innings to beat the Washington Nationals. The 29-year-old was rocked for six earned runs in each of his previous two turns but managed to escape with a pair of no-decisions. Miley dropped to 1-3 with a 6.04 ERA versus the Blue Jays after tossing six innings of two-run ball on July 24. WALK-OFFS 1. Donaldson is riding a seven-game hitting streak overall, but he\xe2\x80\x99s batting only .212 this season versus Baltimore. 2. Orioles 3B Manny Machado, who went 7-for-14 against the Yankees, is batting .388 against the Orioles this year. 3. Toronto leads the season series 7-6.

The team still has veterans with large profiles and larger salaries, but it has been youth that often carried the day.On Sunday, though, it was C. C. Sabathia, 36 and in his 16th major league season, who performed the dutiful work for the Yankees. He pitched six and two-thirds innings against the Baltimore Orioles, subduing for most of the game the fourth-highest-scoring offense in the American League.When he walked back to the Yankee Stadium dugout midway through the seventh inning, fluttering his glove in his right hand as he prepared to bounce down the steps and disappear into the clubhouse, the crowd applauded his performance, even if it had been in vain.The Yankees lost, 5-0, falling short of a three-game sweep of the Orioles and giving back a game to the team that now leads them by three and a half games for the final wild-card spot. The defeat added a sour coda to what had otherwise been a good weekend for the Yankees.

He kept Sanchez relatively quiet, too. Sanchez, the designated hitter Sunday, went without a home run for the first time in four games but had a single and a double in four at-bats. It was just the fourth time in 11 games that he did not homer.

But he held the Mariners to a run in seven innings in his previous start, and on Sunday he looked strong again, keeping a lineup of sluggers quiet except for a solo home run by Steve Pearce. He struck out eight batters and allowed six hits.

Sabathia loaded the bases with his 99th and final pitch, walking Hyun Soo Kim, the ninth hitter in the order. Girardi came to lift him, but the Yankees were already slowly capsizing. When Pearce humbled them once more, lining a two-run single to center field off reliever Adam Warren, the game became an opportunity wasted.

In the fourth inning, with Orioles third baseman Manny Machado shifted from his usual alignment, Sanchez thought he could advance to third on a single by Mark Teixeira.

', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Orioles offense can\\u2019t get started against Jays in 5-1 loss ...', ' Not many baseball teams are going to win many games where they only pick up four hits. That\xe2\x80\x99s how the Orioles opened up their late August series against the Blue Jays in Baltimore on Monday night, dropping a 5-1 decision to increase the O\xe2\x80\x99s deficit in the AL East to four games. The lack of offense meant that the Orioles ended up wasting what was possibly the best start that Wade Miley has made since being traded to the Orioles. Miley was no slouch himself in the game, giving up just five hits over the seven innings he worked. Yes, the Orioles just pulled off back-to-back seven inning starts! That may be the only good news. Unfortunately, two of the five hits Miley gave up were home runs, so he surrendered three runs and left with the Orioles trailing. Counting the nine strikeouts he picked up, it was an impressive outing, and one that, with the Orioles offense being what it is - or at least what it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be - should be good enough most of the time. Is it satisfying to say that, well, sometimes a good offense gets shut down? Even though that\xe2\x80\x99s true, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it any easier to stomach when the Orioles lose a game as the season comes into its closing month. What is also true is what MASN\xe2\x80\x99s Jim Hunter observed in the game\xe2\x80\x99s final moments: This game represented the 35th time in 131 games that the O\xe2\x80\x99s offense were held to two runs or fewer.    Sometimes, good pitching is good It\xe2\x80\x99s not like they got dominated by a scrub. Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Marco Estrada has done very well for himself this season and it was easy to see why tonight. The lone run Estrada gave up was a third inning home run hit by J.J. Hardy, a fly ball with just enough oomph to clear a leaping Melvin Upton.     The Orioles, if you can believe it, led 1-0 at this point in the game. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s home run was his eighth of the year, which also happens to be as many home runs as he hit over the course of all of last season. From there, Estrada shut things down. Over his seven innings of work, Estrada gave up just four hits and a walk. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get many scoring chances like that. The Orioles only had one at-bat with a runner in scoring position in the game, in fact. That makes for a tough task to win, even if your own starter has a good game, as Miley did. Solo home runs by Josh Donaldson and Jose Bautista - two good hitters who are going to hit homers, much as it pains Orioles fans to admit - constituted most of the damage Miley allowed.    The 3-7 hitters for the Orioles went 0 for the entire game! What else can you say? It happens... though it seems to be happening a whole lot for the Orioles of late. Not all of that is because of Adam Jones being out of the lineup with his hamstring issue for a third consecutive game, or because Jonathan Schoop and his .262 post-All-Star OBP batted leadoff in this game.  The outcome is frustrating when combined with a good effort from a starter. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way it goes sometimes. Hoping for luck to turn around Maybe it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even all the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fault. They struck out \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d seven times in the game, really not very many for them. What that means is that, when you take out those strikeouts and Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s homer, there were 20 balls put in play for outs and three put in play for hits. That is a BABIP for the game of .130.     If you had the misfortune of watching the game, you saw more than one play where a reasonably well-struck ball happened to go right to a fielder, including a line drive double play hit right by Matt Wieters to Justin Smoak in the seventh inning, erasing a leadoff walk. It was one of those plays that makes you think, \xe2\x80\x9cOf COURSE that happened.\xe2\x80\x9d The Jays deserve the credit for some of that. It\xe2\x80\x99s not all luck when the fielder is in the right place at the right time. That\xe2\x80\x99s partly good positioning by the defense, or a good job by the pitcher pitching to his defense. But a .130 BABIP is not normal. That\xe2\x80\x99s luck that ought to even out, eventually. Maybe not in this series, when the Orioles need it, and maybe not in time to save their hopes for the season, but eventually! Well, the problem with relying on some pending regression is that the possibility also exists that this type of game is, in fact, the regression for previous unsustainably good luck on the part of the Orioles offense. Not that it ended up mattering, since the three runs were all the Jays needed on Monday, but the final two Jays runs scored in the top of the ninth as the Jays strung together a walk and two hits off of Tommy Hunter. Hunter did not go boom, exactly, in that he surrendered no homers, but every ball on the ground found a hole. There\xe2\x80\x99s that BABIP luck again. As of this writing, every team that the Orioles need to lose for the wild card race is winning or has already won, except for the Yankees, who are losing to the Royals, another team the Orioles need to lose.    There will be rest for neither the weary nor the wicked for the O\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow. They will be going up against a tough lefty in J.A. Happ. It\xe2\x80\x99s weird to refer to Happ as a tough lefty, but when it\xe2\x80\x99s late August and a guy has a 3.19 ERA, that mostly speaks for itself. Plus, the Orioles continue to be the worst-hitting team, by OPS, against lefty pitchers in the whole AL. And who is countering Happ for the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the 7:05 game? None other than Ubaldo Jimenez. I know, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I said too.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
08/30/2016,"[('Tuesday Bird Droppings: Where the Orioles offense will ...', ' Hello, friends. There are now just 31 Orioles games remaining this season, unless they make it into the postseason, which if you\'ve been watching them lately are probably feeling is not too likely. What do you think it will take to win the AL East? Will they need 96 wins to win the AL East? They\'d have to go 25-6 to pull that off. Could it take 92 wins to secure even the second wild card spot? They must go 21-10.    What it adds up to is that, as likely as not, the Orioles cannot lose more games from here on out than what can be counted on both hands. They must do this against a slate of games facing tough, playoff-bound competition, and many of these games will be on the road. And they must do this while, for the moment, three-fifths of their starting rotation consists of Wade Miley, Ubaldo Jimenez, and Yovani Gallardo. My goodness. The postseason isn\'t happening this year. The rotation anxiety isn\'t even getting into the problems, such as there occasionally are, with the offense. These were on display in last night\'s 5-1 loss to the Blue Jays, where Miley actually pitched well. The O\'s only got four hits, and scored two or fewer runs for the 35th time this season. Yikes. You can read\xc2\xa0my recap of the not-so-lovely totals here. So the Orioles are four games out of the AL East. They\'re now just one game up on the Tigers for the second wild card, and two up on the Royals and Astros. They defend that slim wild card lead tonight with Ubaldo Jimenez on the mound, facing off against Jays lefty J.A. Happ. If they can only lose ten games, this is probably going to be one of the ten.

Happ. Game time is set for just after 7 PM. "", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles beat Blue Jays with strong starting pitching, home ...', "" The Baltimore Orioles put on a great show tonight, getting contributions from across the roster. The most unexpected, of course, was Ubaldo Jimenez, who had himself a fine game in limiting the Jays to three runs.    On offense it was three home runs (of course) that did the trick with one each from Steve Pearce, Manny Machado, and Matt Wieters. Dongs for Happ JA Happ is a left-handed pitcher who came into this game with a 3.19 ERA. He has already beaten the Orioles twice this year. This didn\xe2\x80\x99t bode well for the Orioles, and for the first four innings it looked like the Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to do much against him. Our guys actually had base runners in innings 1-4, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of them. They went 0-for-5 with runners in scoring position, through those first four, but made up for it with a three-run fifth that put them back on top (for the moment).    As is so often the case, the Orioles used the almighty dong to get back into the game. Steve Pearce, traded for at the deadline because he is a murderer of lefties, got the party started with a solo home run to left field to tie the game.    Two batters later, Manny Machado hit 32nd home run into the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen. It was a beaut, and with a runner on gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 3-1 lead that they would hold until the seventh. The dong was the 100th of Manny\xe2\x80\x99s young career, making him the youngest Oriole to reach 100 and the third-fastest Oriole to get there.    Welcome home to Ubaldomore Just like with Wade Miley yesterday, many Orioles fans went into this game dreading the damage that would be wrought on the starting pitcher by the potent Blue Jays lineup. And just like yesterday, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. Things looked dicey for Ubaldo Jimenez through the first two innings, though he escaped with just one run allowed. In the first inning he walked two but induced an inning ending double play. In the second the evil Michael Saunders doubled and came around to score on a single. That gave the Blue Jays a 1-0 lead, but after that Ubaldo stopped pitching the way we expected him to and started kicking ass.    After giving up the RBI single, Jimenez went on to retire the next eight batters he faced. The ninth batter hit a one-out single and was immediately erased on a double play. Ubaldo followed that with a 1-2-3 sixth inning and cruised into the seventh inning with a 3-1 lead. And that\xe2\x80\x99s when things went awry. Some might say (with the benefit of hindsight) that Jimenez should have been taken out after six innings. He has a checkered past and the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a big lead. But I think him going back out for the seventh was absolutely the right call. With one out, Russell Martin on first base, and Brad Brach warming in the bullpen, guy I hate Michael Saunders came to the plate. I got nervous. You got nervous, too, I know it. Well, Saunders did just what we feared he would: he hit a game-tying home run. It was deflating and a tough way to see Ubaldo\xe2\x80\x99s night go, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it made his ruined his game. It did really stink, though. Ubaldo got one more out before being pulled for Brad Brach. His final pitching line was 6.2 IP, 5 H, 3 R, 2 BB, 3 K. Not outstanding, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that from Ubaldo any time.      Ubaldo Jimenez's ERA in his last three starts? 2.55 (5 ER in 17 2/3 IP). #Orioles\r \xe2\x80\x94 Eduardo A. Encina (@EddieInTheYard) August 31, 2016    Did I mention we like dongs? Once both starters were out of the game with the score 3-3, I felt mild confidence that the boys would get the job done. Brad Brach looked great, pitching 1.1 innings with just one single allowed. That bought time for the O\xe2\x80\x99s offense to come back. The heroes of the late innings were Jonathan Schoop and Matt Wieters. With two outs in the eighth Schoop worked a walk off of Jason Grilli to keep the inning alive for Wieters. Wieters has been disappointing at times this season, but this was not one of them. He took Grilli deep for a two-run homer onto the flag court to give the Orioles a 5-3 lead. After that it was just a formality as Zach Britton came in to get his 39th save of the season. Coming up The Orioles and Blue Jays will meet for a rubber game tomorrow with Yovani Gallardo pitching for the Orioles and and Aaron Sanchez for the Jays. This is a mismatch for sure, but after tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling a little confident.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
08/31/2016,"[('How many wins will the Orioles need to make the playoffs ...', ' There are now just 30 games remaining in the Orioles regular season. Those 30 games will determine the fate of the universe, or at least the fate of our little corner of baseball for this season.    At 72-60 right now, the Orioles sit in third place in the American League East, trailing the leading Blue Jays by two games and the second place Red Sox by one game. They have the edge for the second AL wild card spot by a single game over the Tigers, with all of the Astros, Royals, Yankees, and Mariners within four games. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of competition that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are going to have to hold off in order to just have the opportunity to play one game to continue on in the playoffs. How many wins do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take for the Orioles to hold those teams off?    The pessimist\xe2\x80\x99s case A pessimist - which longtime Camden Chat readers know is me - might look at all of these teams that are charging hard to gain ground on the O\xe2\x80\x99s and think that more than one of them will end up topping 90 wins, so if the Orioles are going to make the postseason, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to top 90 wins, too.    That means the Orioles would have to play .600 baseball just to get to 90 wins - an 18-12 record over the remainder of the season. The Orioles have topped a .600 winning percentage in both April and June this season, so they\xe2\x80\x99re capable of playing that well over a long stretch of time. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s also been a while since the Orioles have played at that caliber for that long. The O\xe2\x80\x99s finished July with a sub-.500 record and whether or not they close out the Jays series with a win tonight, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be below-.500 for August, too. Turning that around while their best starting pitcher, Chris Tillman, is on the shelf for a couple of weeks is a tough task.    The optimist\xe2\x80\x99s case Maybe they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to get above 90 wins, though. A lower number could end up being enough. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of griping in the realm of Orioles fans about the prognosticating machines  and people at Fangraphs, especially before a season kicks off. Indeed, when the staff of that website predicted the AL postseason teams before the season began, not a single one of them picked the Orioles as a postseason team.  One writer was even riding hard for the Minnesota Twins to win the AL Central. The Twins have a 49-83 record right now. More of Fangraphs thought what\xe2\x80\x99s now a .371 team would make the postseason than thought the Orioles would.    So it might surprise you that right now, based on their projected rest of season standings, Fangraphs thinks that the Orioles will claim the second wild card spot with a record of 88-74. Not an overwhelmingly great record, but then again, I am 32 years old, and there have only been four seasons in my lifetime where the Orioles have won more games than that. If you were born from 1993-1996, you\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen three seasons above 88 wins. An Orioles fan born after 1997 has only been alive for two. Fangraphs is not the only site who presently likes the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 chances. ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Dan Szymborski, the keeper of the ZiPS projection system, also projects out the Orioles to an 88-74 record (Insider required) and puts their postseason chances at 54.6% overall. You have to like them being better than 50%, though if the Orioles lose tonight, they\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be right back below 50%.  To get to 88 wins, the Orioles would have to go 16-14. That\xe2\x80\x99s merely a .520 winning percentage, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound so daunting. It may yet prove to be daunting given that the Orioles will play half of their remaining games on the road.  Up to this point in the season, the Orioles have played to a .439 winning percentage on the road. Depending on whether you round up or round down, that would mean a 6-9 or 7-8 road record for the last month of the season. If they go 6-9 on the road, they have to go 10-5 at home to reach 88 wins. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been nearly that good at home to date (.652 winning percentage,) but it\xe2\x80\x99s still a tall order. The teams chasing the Orioles And all of that is assuming that 88 wins is what gets it done. It may not do so. Of the wild card competing teams I named above, all of them except for the Royals are projected to win 16 of their remaining games. If any of those teams are hotter than that for the remainder of the season, that\xe2\x80\x99s less of a cushion the Orioles have.    The Royals get a 14-16 rest of season projection, which may be unreasonably pessimistic for them. Kansas City only plays 13 of their last 30 games against teams in the postseason hunt. The Orioles, facing an AL East-laden September with three other AL East teams in the postseason picture, must play 20 of their last 30 games against contenders. The AL East heavy schedule could be a positive, if the Orioles can win, because they will have direct chances to take games out of the Red Sox and Blue Jays and improve their own standing. But that requires them to play well against those good teams, and if they lose, their chances are doubly hurt. Games like tonight\xe2\x80\x99s where Yovani Gallardo faces the Jays sluggers do not inspire confidence. Does Detroit have an 18-12 finish in them? Can the Astros finish 19-11? The Yankees must close out with a 21-10 record in order to get above 88 wins. For the Royals it would be 20-10. The Mariners must go 21-9 to make the playoffs, if 88 wins is the number. No one of those things seems to be a likely outcome, individually. Even the team with the best record in baseball, the Cubs, has not won two-thirds of the games it has played this season. They have played to a .641 winning percentage. The Astros would \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d need to play .633 baseball from here on to get to 89 wins. For the Tigers that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmerely\xe2\x80\x9d .600 baseball for the last month.  The chances that one among that group plays as well as they need to play are greater than any one team\xe2\x80\x99s chances of doing so. And all of this is assuming that the Orioles get to 88 wins to begin with, which they may not do.     It may be optimistic to think they play .500 baseball from here on and win 87 games. Now all of the teams chasing them have that much of an easier time catching and passing them. And if they play below .500 from here on? That means forget about the postseason. An 86 win season is better than a 68 win season, but that\xe2\x80\x99s about all you can say about it.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Does Joe Gunkel fit into the Orioles future? - Camden Chat', ' Week after week, reports from the Orioles minor-league system have been full of surprises. Happenings down on the farm have been somewhat encouraging, even with a pre-season \xe2\x80\x9cdoom and gloom\xe2\x80\x9d prediction. One of the biggest noise-makers has been Joe Gunkel, a man who deserves much more attention that he\xe2\x80\x99s currently being given.    The 2013 18th round pick out of West Chester was acquired by the O\xe2\x80\x99s in last year\xe2\x80\x99s mid-season Alejandro De Aza trade with the Boston Red Sox.  At the time, the deal seemed clear-cut \xe2\x80\x94 trade a player who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t performing for a mid-level arm who had a chance to be a semi-formidable option moving forward. Boston knew it\xe2\x80\x99d be unlikely for Gunkel to turn into a superstar, while the Orioles felt enough confidence to pull the trigger.  The move seemed to be fair and balanced at the time, but it\xe2\x80\x99s now very clear that the Birds got the better end of the deal. With De Aza having jumped to the Giants and then Mets since the trade, it\xe2\x80\x99s been Gunkel who has lived up to his potential.    Now, De Aza serves as a part-time, below-the-mendoza-line lineup filler for the Mets while Gunkel has established himself as AAA Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s best starting pitcher.    Realistically, the 24-year-old right-hander is giving the Orioles a look at a potential future big-league arm with the events of his 2016 season. The pros Though he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of as much of a top-tier prospect in 2013\xe2\x80\x99s Draft, Gunkel has proven that what he did in his final two years at West Chester wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an aberration or byproduct of lower-level talent.    There, he went 17-5 with an ERA in the low 2.00\xe2\x80\x99s in his final two seasons, pitching to contact but keeping his walk and home run rates on the low end. His numbers painted him as a reliable, not overpowering starting arm who managed collegiate-level hitters very well. But what they didn\xe2\x80\x99t show was any reason to believe he\xe2\x80\x99d have overwhelming success at the pro level. As with the majority of arms making the leap to the minor-leagues, Gunkel was expected to take a dip in terms of overall numbers.  But as he has played out his first three full pro ball seasons, he shown the exact opposite of regression.    Here\xe2\x80\x99s a quick look at the nitty gritty of his numbers since 2014 \xe2\x80\x94 every level (Red Sox and Orioles) included:  2014 (full-A and high-A): 6-5, 3.47 ERA, 103.2 IP, 88 H, 24 BB, 101 K, .228 AVG 2015 (high-A and AA): 11-6, 2.68 ERA, 144.2 IP, 127 H, 27 BB, 113 K, .236 AVG 2016 (AA and AAA): 8-13, 3.76 ERA, 150.2 IP, 166 H, 20 BB, 101 K, .279 AVG  What immediately stands out with Gunkel is his consistency to stay in the strike zone and pitch very effectively to contact. Unlike many rising Orioles prospects, he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to keep a consistent grasp on finding the zone.  His walk percentage since he\xe2\x80\x99s arrived on scene with the Orioles has been tremendous, shown by his 1.17 BB/9 ratio this season in Norfolk. Last year, in 17 starts at Bowie, that number, too, impressed at 1.37.  This year, he has the best walks/innings ratio among starters in the International League. What you also like to see is the consistency of staying on the field and making outings on a regular basis. After being eased into a starting role in 2014 (15 starts, 27 appearances), he made 22 starts in 2015 before a career-high \xe2\x80\x94 both in HS and college \xe2\x80\x94 26 starts this season.    According to the numbers at MLBfarm.com, the 6\xe2\x80\x995\xe2\x80\x9d Gunkel has also done an adequate job at keeping balls on the ground and out of harms way, likely contributing to his low earned-run totals. This year, 43 percent of balls are going for groundouts, as shown below:         MLBfarm.com   The cons Despite the fact that his ERA has shown a level of consistently being good enough at each level, concerns regarding just how much he\xe2\x80\x99s pitching to contact have to be at the forefront of the minds of O\xe2\x80\x99s talent evaluators.  Sure, his ultra-low walk rates have contributed to the big picture of his numbers \xe2\x80\x94 but at the end of the day, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore the spike in opposing average that he\xe2\x80\x99s seen with the Tides this year. In reality, the only true aspect of his game that is currently acting as a barrier comes within the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s ability to barrel up the ball and make regular contact. In 11 of Gunkel\xe2\x80\x99s last 12 games, the opposing team has notched at-least one hit per inning he\xe2\x80\x99s pitched.    Luckily home runs haven\xe2\x80\x99t been an issue and a lack of free passes have kept his WHIP at just 1.23 on the year. But before proclaiming Gunkel as the next great Orioles starter, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to realize that hitters aren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly missing the baseball \xe2\x80\x94 also shown in a decrease of overall strikeouts.  It should be noted that Gunkel\xe2\x80\x99s overall arsenal isn\xe2\x80\x99t incredibly complex or overwhelming. He only has three pitches \xe2\x80\x94 a low 90s fastball (impeccable command), a mid 80s change, and a slider that is still in the development process.  Despite the top-tier command, you\xe2\x80\x99d like to see a rising prospect have more than two fully mastered pitches. He\xe2\x80\x99s still relatively young, but the tall righty isn\xe2\x80\x99t known as crafty. Future with the Birds There\xe2\x80\x99s clearly a high level of complexity with the potential of Gunkel finding a long-term home in Baltimore. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know how his \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 or lack thereof \xe2\x80\x94 will translate to the major league level. But the 2012 MVP of the NCAA Division-II College World Series is worthy of serious consideration for a future rotation spot. These days, it\xe2\x80\x99s rare that a pitching prospect in the Orioles organization is worthy of excitement.    And while it might be premature to label him a sure-fire future piece of the rotation, it surely appears the Orioles might have a legitimate candidate in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Gunk\xe2\x80\x9d.  At the very least, O\xe2\x80\x99s fans can take solace in the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s not developing in the Boston organization. NOTE: All stats totaled before Gunkel\xe2\x80\x99s Tuesday night start in which he went 5.2 innings, allowing 7 hits and 2 earned runs, no walks and striking out 5.

Is it enough to get them into the playoffs?Keeping up with all the moves that the Baltimore Orioles have made over the last 24 hours? Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. We got it all taken care of for you.A lot has gone down in so little time.It started with the O\xe2\x80\x99s bringing back reliever Tommy Hunter. While it was a feel good story to bring Big Game back to the team, he also is an upgrade to the bullpen. He gives Buck Showalter a reliable option at a time when the Orioles need it most. In order to make room for Hunter, the team designated T.J. McFarland for assignment.Wednesday things got real wild.It started with the Orioles acquiring left-handed reliever Kyle Lobstein from the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Zach Phillips. To make room for Lobstein, they designated Ashur Tolliver for assignment. So logically, the O\xe2\x80\x99s would DFA Lobstein just hours later.Baltimore claimed outfielder Drew Stubbs off waivers from the Texas Rangers, and sent Lobstein to the minors in his place. The addition of Stubbs brings the O\xe2\x80\x99s a player that can play all three outfield spots and offer some speed and pop to the lineup. Orioles General Manager Dan Duquette said before the game that he is a base stealer (wait, the Orioles know what stolen bases are?).Hold on. There is more.One hour after the Orioles announced that they have claimed Stubbs, they are finalizing a deal for Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder Michael Bourn. Bourn gives the O\xe2\x80\x99s another base stealer, a category the team ranks dead last in the Majors. That\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion we had on the latest episode of our podcast.\xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/8 - Baltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters Suits Up for His First Game Against Orioles5/8 - Baltimore Orioles Player Profile: Aderlin Rodriguez5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore5/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley5/6 - Baltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from AngelsWith teams able to expand their rosters tomorrow, a lot of teams in contention are making last-minute deals. The Orioles are no different. Clearly, this is a message that something is wrong with Adam Jones. If the team felt it needed not one, but two outfielders on the last day to add postseason eligible players, they are worried that Jones\xe2\x80\x99 hamstring is going to be a problem the rest of the way.But have they made enough moves to stay in the playoff hunt? Not until they find a starter. Just do not count on that happening.Before the season started, everyone knew what would make or break the Orioles season. The starting pitching was going to decide if this team would make the playoffs. That has never been more clear right now with Chris Tillman on the disabled list.Yovani Gallardo gave up two home runs in the first inning last night and the Toronto Blue Jays had an early lead in minutes. The Orioles were already playing from behind before getting a chance to swing the bats. That seems to be an all too common theme for the Orioles starters.No Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fan liked the idea of entering a pivotal series against the Blue Jays with Gallardo, Wade Miley and Ubaldo Jimenez on the mound. There is not much available in terms of staring pitching at this time of the year either. The teams that are in it are not dealing their players and rest of the teams with pieces can wait until the offseason to find the best deal. However, some team has to be dangling something better than we have seen from the O\xe2\x80\x99s starting staff.The aforementioned names were not the reason the Orioles lost the series against the Blue Jays, but they do not give you confidence the rest of the way either. Each has an ERA over 5.00 and has struggled to keep the team in ball games. That is something the O\xe2\x80\x99s can ill afford at a point of the season where every game counts.Believe it or not, the Orioles had options. Scott Kazmir is having a down year by his standards, but his 4.41 ERA and an outstanding K/9 rate of 9.02 is much better than what the current staff has to offer. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to imagine the Los Angeles Dodgers giving him up easily as they remain in the postseason chase.James Shields is having an awful season with the Chicago White Sox. His numbers are similar to those of Miley, Ubaldo and Gallardo. That is not encouraging, but if you had to pick one of the four to win you one game, your choice is still Shields. His track record is significantly better than the others.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireNBA Playoffs: Recap, must-see highlights from Wizards vs. Celtics Game 43h agoBaltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters Suits Up for His First Game Against Orioles6h agoBaltimore Orioles Player Profile: Aderlin Rodriguez8h agoBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s return was a welcomed one in Baltimore1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley1 d agoThat brings me to Ervin Santana, a name that was available on waivers and would have been an instant upgrade. Santana was a player that the O\xe2\x80\x99s have had interest in previously. His 3.54 ERA in 147 1/3 innings is better than every Orioles starter, and with the Minnesota Twins out of it, they are looking for an attractive offer. His contract is not team friendly, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the price you pay when your team is in the hunt.Instead, the Orioles opted for more hitters over starting pitching.Bourn and Stubbs are solid Major League players. They are already an upgrade over Nolan Reimold and give the Orioles something they do not have on the roster: speed. They can be used as pinch runners and defensive replacements late in games, but neither is going to be the reason the O\xe2\x80\x99s are in our out of the playoffs.This team would have been better with another starter in the rotation. Whether it was one of three players on waivers or someone else out there, the Orioles are going to go as far as this pitching staff will take them. The Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox are getting results from their starters, while the O\xe2\x80\x99s are fading because of the lack of arms. div.apply-now .apply form .submit.apply-now-submit-1:hover{background-color:#f77f00!important}Want your voice heard?

The rotation is shaky, Jones and Tillman are hurt, the bats have been inconsistent and the schedule is unrelenting. If this team is going to make the playoffs, they will have earned it. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Will September call-ups make a difference for the Orioles ...', ' The calendar has turned to September, which means it is time for the annual baseball ritual of September call-ups. If they can fit you into the dugout and onto the 40-man roster, they can have you on the major league team. There is no more 25-man roster limit for the rest of the regular season.    In the bad days of the Orioles franchise, September call-ups mostly meant the appearance of some guys who were never going to matter, although if they had a nice month you could tell yourself they might be on the next good Orioles team. As it turned out, no, guys like Bernie Castro and Walter Young were never going to matter. Now that the Orioles are good, September call-ups mean something different. It is important to be able to plug gaps that may exist on the roster that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to fill when they can only carry 25 players. With the O\xe2\x80\x99s in what\xe2\x80\x99s presently a five or six way battle for the second AL Wild Card spot, they need to grab every little edge that they can. In the last day of August, they were clearly already trying to do so, with the acquisitions of outfielders Drew Stubbs and Michael Bourn looking to give them more late-inning pinch running or defensive replacement options.    Meanwhile, the Red Sox, who sit in the first wild card spot and are looking to get into the AL East lead, have chosen to call up the top prospect in all of baseball, Yoan Moncada. That must be nice to have one of those laying around.    The Orioles obviously don\xe2\x80\x99t have any Moncadas lying around to summon to the big leagues, but will they be able to address any of the problems they\xe2\x80\x99re facing over the last month? Your answer to that question probably depends on what you see as the problems that the Orioles have to deal with. And whatever problems you think that the Orioles face right now, we can likely all agree that the first wave of September call-ups - Caleb Joseph, Tyler Wilson, and Jayson Aquino, according to David Hall of The Virginian-Pilot - aren\xe2\x80\x99t fixing anything.    What has ailed the Orioles this season falls into three broad categories, two of which were problems even while they were winning and in first place. Outfield defense Mark Trumbo has hit 40 homers and counting and that\xe2\x80\x99s great, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take too long watching him out there to see that he\xe2\x80\x99s not at his best in the outfield. Hyun Soo Kim is someone who you have to love watching him at the plate. Not so much when you have to watch him chase a ball into the left field corner.  The Orioles also haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a backup center fielder since Joey Rickard was hurt, which has cost them since the hamstring injury to Adam Jones.    The additions of Stubbs and Bourn at least help with that last part. Either one could actually be capable of playing center field better than Nolan Reimold, and though neither one has hit well, they can hardly hit much worse than Reimold. Well, I say that, but what I kept saying about outfielders last year was, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, (new guy) can hardly be worse than (guy who stunk)\xe2\x80\x9d and guess what? They all stunk. You can\xe2\x80\x99t really call this problem solved because the Orioles have to play Trumbo and Kim. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to, of course - you know what I mean. A seventh or eighth inning defensive replacement still means the Orioles must get through six or seven innings with a sub-par defensive outfield. Starting pitching Thanks to a non-disastrous series against the Blue Jays - at least as far as the rotation is concerned - the Orioles rotation ERA has snuck below 5 to a 4.93 mark. Only one team in the American League has had its starting pitchers throw fewer innings than the Orioles, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the 49-84 Twins, losers of 13 straight games. The problem here is that the rotation is going to stay with its current makeup - and it\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to stay without Chris Tillman for at least another week. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a problem that will be solved by Wilson, Aquino, or Parker Bridwell or Odrisamer Despaigne or anyone else they might call up. If there\xe2\x80\x99s some good news, it\xe2\x80\x99s that the struggling 60% of the rotation (and what an absurd phrase to apply to a team that is in a playoff spot on September 1) is coming off of three straight quality starts against the Blue Jays... so maybe they won\xe2\x80\x99t be horrible?    The additions of extra pitchers will mean that at least the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t have to desperately scramble to fill innings if there are a string of short starting pitching outings. But, at this point in the season, if they still end up having that problem, their playoff hopes are probably toast, so how much help is it, really? The offense The why of the Orioles second half offensive struggle is a matter for some debate, and not one that has just one answer, in any case. What is clear is the result: Before the All-Star break, the Orioles had an .800 OPS as a team and averaged 5.08 runs per game. Since the break, they\xe2\x80\x99ve mustered only a .711 OPS and 3.98 runs per game. The month of July was worse for the Orioles offense than August - at least by OPS with a .664 for July (holy crap! So bad!) and a .772 for August - but the August struggles might stick in your craw more - like the span of four losses in five games where the team lost 4-2, 3-2, 2-1, and 1-0 games. Those last two came against Zach Neal and Ross freaking Detwiler, for crying out loud. Caleb Joseph and the Quest for a Zero RBI Season is not the solution to this problem. Even if the Orioles called up more hitters from the minors in hopes that someone like Christian Walker or Trey Mancini could spark the lineup, where are you going to play them? Actually, there is some room to play with there. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to replace Pedro Alvarez against a righty pitcher, but against a lefty, you could. Same with Kim. Though of course, the Orioles already traded for Steve Pearce as this kind of player, and their performance over the last six weeks makes it clear that, while they struggle against lefties, it\xe2\x80\x99s not their only problem. Heck, the one game they won against the Jays was the one started by lefty J.A. Happ.    Either way, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t solve second half cold streaks for regular players like Matt Wieters (.612 OPS since the break) or Jonathan Schoop (.658). It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help them when they go 0-10 with runners in scoring position over the recently-concluded series with the Jays, when they actually had decent starting pitching. ** For the most part, September call-ups are not going to be what saves the Orioles. Stubbs or Bourn might help them a bit, especially if Jones continues to miss some games the rest of the way, but as for the rest, the only people who can save the Orioles season are the people who\xe2\x80\x99ve been here the whole time.  They\xe2\x80\x99re good enough to do it. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that when they\xe2\x80\x99re at their best. Whether they will is another story. That\xe2\x80\x99s what the last month of the baseball season will tell.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

But it was a struggle today.""The Yankees came to town with a season-high four straight series wins, but they will leave with their ninth consecutive series loss in Baltimore.""It\'s tough, especially when CC goes out there and pitches his butt off,"" right fielder Aaron Judge said. ""If we win tomorrow, we forget about today.""Gausman struck out six of the first eight batters and experienced only one difficult inning, the fourth. New York loaded the bases with one out before Starlin Castro struck out and Brian McCann hit a fly ball to left.A double and an error by Judge provided Baltimore with an unearned run in the bottom half, and Jones hit his 25th home run in the fifth.The suddenly punchless New York offense had no answer. The Yankees totaled 27 runs against Baltimore over two games last weekend before Gausman stepped to the mound.FAREWELL TO TEXMaryland native Mark Teixeira will play his final game at Camden Yards on Sunday.Teixeira was cheered as a visiting player in Baltimore until he signed as a free agent with New York in 2009. From that point, the hometown kid heard only boos.""When you play a long time, it really doesn\'t bother you at all,"" Teixeira said.Besides, it\'s not like he spurned the Orioles in 2009. ""They didn\'t have any intention of signing me. They made an offer just to say they made an offer,"" he said.TRAINERS ROOMYankees: RHP Chad Green (2-4, 4.73) has a sprained elbow and is likely done for the season.

The team averaged 5.29 runs per game in August, the most in the American League, but managed just two hits off Orioles starter Dylan Bundy and none off the relievers Donnie Hart, Vance Worley and Tommy Hunter.The Yankees went hitless for the final six innings, and a single by Brett Gardner in the first and a single by Jacoby Ellsbury in the third were their only hits.The Yankees took two out of three against the Orioles last weekend at Yankee Stadium, and they have won four consecutive series.

Teixeira was born in Annapolis, Md., and went to high school in Baltimore.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had some great games here,\xe2\x80\x9d Teixeira said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy first three-home-run game was here, with the Texas Rangers. Always seem to hit a bunch of home runs here. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a good place to hit. So I\xe2\x80\x99ve always enjoyed playing here.\xe2\x80\x9dBut the Orioles have not been kind this weekend as the Yankees continued to eye a wild-card playoff spot. Baltimore shut out the Yankees for the second night in a row, 2-0. The Orioles hold the second American League wild-card spot, which makes each game in this series so important.\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s game is probably the most important game of the year,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Joe Girardi said.The Yankees now sit four and a half games back in the wild-card race.

On Saturday, Orioles starter Kevin Gausman also allowed just two hits and struck out eight in six innings. The Yankees finished with four hits.

Jacoby Ellsbury walked, Gary Sanchez singled, and Didi Gregorius was hit by a pitch, loading the bases with one out. But Starlin Castro struck out and Brian McCann flied out to get Gausman and the Orioles out of the jam.\xe2\x80\x9cHe was just living on the edges with all his pitches, not only his fastball, but his breaking ball and his splitter,\xe2\x80\x9d Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge said of Gausman. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, just really locating his spots.\xe2\x80\x9d Sign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

Sabathia had a solid outing for the Yankees, going six innings and giving up six hits and one earned run. The Orioles broke through first in the fourth inning. Mark Trumbo led off with a double to left field. Then, later in the inning, Chris Davis singled to right field. Trumbo initially held up at third base, but Judge mishandled the ball as he tried to glove it. Trumbo scored on the error.

On Saturday, a magnetic resonance imaging test revealed that he had a sprained ulnar collateral ligament and a strained flexor tendon in the elbow. The injury puts the rest of his season in jeopardy and will force the Yankees to replace him in the rotation.

In 24 games, Sanchez hit .389 with 11 home runs, 21 runs batted in and 20 runs scored. He reached 11 home runs faster than anyone in major league history: 23 career games.\xe2\x80\x9cFeels great to win the award,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanchez said, speaking through an interpreter before Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game. \xe2\x80\x9cThe focus is to win games right now \xe2\x80\x94 we want to keep winning games, we want to keep winning series.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Two out of three ain\'t bad \xe2\x80\x94 unless you\'re looking to make some headway in the crowded AL playoff race.The Baltimore Orioles sputtered in the clutch Sunday, and the resulting 5-2 loss to the New York Yankees ruined their bid for a three-game sweep.Coming off an 8-0 win on Friday night and a 2-0 victory Saturday, the Orioles missed a chance to sustain the momentum before hitting the road.""We\'re trying to win games. You beat them twice and you\'re trying to beat them a third time,"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""We just didn\'t have much offensively.""The Orioles stranded nine and went 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position.After falling behind 4-0 in the fourth inning, Baltimore closed to 4-2 before wasting an opportunity to complete the comeback in the fifth.Adam Jones led off with a single and scored on a double by Pedro Alvarez. Luis Severino (2-8) replaced starter Michael Pineda and struck out Manny Machado before issuing two straight walks to load the bases. Steve Pearce struck out and Matt Wieters chopped a grounder to second base to end the threat.Baltimore got only one more hit the rest of the way.Before this series, the Orioles had lost five of seven. So while failing to complete the sweep wasn\'t ideal, at least Baltimore could take consolation in being in position to do so.""I mean, I\'m trying to keep a positive mind frame,"" first baseman Chris Davis said. ""We won the series and we\'ll move forward.""Baltimore is tied with Detroit for the second AL wild-card slot, but the loss dropped the Orioles three games out of first place in the AL East.After being shut out three consecutive times by the Orioles over a seven-day span, the Yankees promptly put an end to the streak with a three-run first inning.Wade Miley (8-12) walked the first two batters and struck out the next two before Chase Headley hit an RBI single. A wild pitch and a two-run single by Austin Romine followed.Headley singled home a run in the fourth, and Pearce hit a run-scoring grounder in the bottom half.Brett Gardner made it 5-2 with a sacrifice fly in the ninth.The victory was huge for the Yankees, who came to town after winning four straight series.""You can\'t afford to lose three in a row to these guys,"" manager Joe Girardi said. ""We know they play really well in this building. We lost a tough one (Saturday) night. To be able to bounce back is important. It keeps us alive.""Indeed, the young, retooled Yankees remain a part of the playoff picture, trailing Baltimore and Detroit by 3 1/2 games for the final wild card.Severino (2-8) pitched two strong innings of relief and Dellin Betances, the fifth New York reliever, got four outs for his eighth save.TRAINER\'S ROOMYankees: SS Didi Gregorius was held out of the starting lineup after absorbing some bumps and bruises during the series. ""His arm is sore where he\'s been hit the past few days,"" Girardi said. . 1B Mark Teixeira doesn\'t usually play in day games after playing the previous night, and thus was given Sunday off. Commenting on the ice pack Teixeira had on his neck before the game, Girardi said, ""He deals with his neck, he deals with his knee. It\'s not what you want, but it\'s the reality.""Orioles: RHP Chris Tillman (shoulder) threw off a mound and remains on course to come off the disabled list on Sept. 11.UP NEXTYankees: RHP Masahiro Tanaka (11-4, 3.12 ERA) opens a three-game series against visiting Toronto on Monday. New York is 3-9 against the Blue Jays this season, losing all four series.Orioles: RHP Ubaldo Jimenez (5-11, 6.46) starts Monday in the opener of a three-game series at Tampa Bay.

The Yankees arrived in Baltimore two and a half games out of the second wild-card spot, currently shared by the Orioles and the Detroit Tigers. They will leave it one more game back, with 27 left in the regular season.While the Yankees were not able to cut into the deficit this weekend, it could have been worse for them. A loss on Sunday would have put them five and a half games behind Baltimore \xe2\x80\x94 and trailing Detroit, Houston, Kansas City and Seattle in pursuit of the Orioles.\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose three in a row to these guys,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we know they play really well in this building. We lost a tough game last night. To be able to bounce back today is important and keeps us alive.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The Yankees went with a particularly young lineup Sunday: Rob Refsnyder, Aaron Judge, Tyler Austin and Ronald Torreyes all started. Girardi rested Didi Gregorius, whose arm was sore after being hit by a pitch on Saturday night. Mark Teixeira also was on the bench, as he usually has been for a day game after a night game.

In 82 plate appearances entering the game, Romine was hitting .273 against left-handers, compared with a .245 average over all.

Pineda said that if a pitch was located well, it could lead to a ground ball or strikeout \xe2\x80\x94 the kind of results that can keep Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s power hitters at bay.\xe2\x80\x9cThose guys, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to swing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.The Yankees will now start a 10-game homestand while still in the middle of the wild-card race, although it remains an uphill battle with several teams in contention.

Slugger Chris Davis looks to continue a productive campaign against the Tampa Bay Rays when his Baltimore Orioles pay a visit for the second of a three-game set on Tuesday night. Davis belted his fourth homer of 2016 against the Rays in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s 7-3 triumph and boasts 12 RBIs in the season series as the Orioles improved to 10-3 against Tampa Bay. Davis owns 26 homers and 69 RBIs in 92 games against the Rays in his career and is 6-for-15 with two blasts in his last four games overall for the Orioles, who remain tied with Detroit for the American League\xe2\x80\x99s second wild card. Davis has a homer this season against Tampa Bay\xe2\x80\x99s Tuesday starter Jake Odorizzi, who is 6-0 with a 1.89 ERA since the All-Star break but is 1-1 with a 4.91 mark in four starts versus the Orioles in 2016. Rays home run and RBI leader Evan Longoria left Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game with a sore right hand after being hit by a pitch, but X-rays were negative and he is considered day-to-day. Tampa Bay second baseman Logan Forsythe was rested Monday and should be back in the lineup for the middle game of the series after going 9-for-15 in his previous four games. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Yovani Gallardo (4-7, 5.62 ERA) vs. Rays RH Jake Odorizzi (9-5, 3.56) Gallardo is winless in five starts, but received just 13 runs of support during the drought while allowing three or fewer earned runs in four of those outings. The 30-year-old Mexican, who is 2-5 with a 7.18 ERA on the road, gave up six runs in 10 1/3 innings during two no-decisions versus the Rays in 2016. Corey Dickerson is 5-for-9 with a homer against Gallardo, who is 2-1 lifetime versus Tampa Bay. Odorizzi remained unbeaten in nine starts after limiting the Boston Red Sox to three runs and five hits over six innings of a no-decision last Tuesday. The Illinois native, who owns a 2.92 ERA at home this season, boasts 146 strikeouts and just 47 walks across 161 2/3 innings. Adam Jones is 11-for-28 with two homers versus Odorizzi, who is 3-3 with a 4.83 ERA in his career against the Orioles. WALK-OFFS 1. Tampa Bay CF Kevin Kiermaier has hit safely in nine consecutive games, going 12-for-39 during that stretch. 2. Baltimore 3B Manny Machado owns a hit in each of his last six games and is 7-for-26 lifetime with two homers and six RBIs against Odorizzi. 3. The Rays recalled RHP Steve Geltz, OF Mikie Mahtook, INF/OF Richie Shaffer, RHP Chase Whitley and LHP Justin Marks after Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game.

With Tillman down for at least a while longer and the end of the season coming up at them the Orioles are going to need some pleasant surprises. They would be facing off against Jake Odorizzi.    The fireworks started early on the night. In the bottom of the first inning Gallardo gave up a lead off home run to Logan Forsythe on a 3-1 pitch that Forsythe lined into the right center field seats. 1-0, Rays. Gallardo would get out of the rest of the inning cleanly allowing some Orioles fans to put down their pitch forks and some others to walk away from their ledges. The rest of the fan base would be calmed in the top of the second inning as Chris Davis launched his signature high fly ball to left center field for a dinger. 1-1, tie game. The Orioles and Rays would flip flop leaving runners on base in the second and third innings as the Odorizzi and Gallardo threw lots of pitches to get a few outs. The Orioles would bring the bats to the top of the fourth inning. Davis led off the inning with a single to center field. Matt Wieters then worked a one out walk which was followed by a hit by pitch for Jonathan Schoop to load the bases for J.J. Hardy. Hardy again worked a deep count and ended up lacing a 3-2 pitch down the left field line for a two run double. 3-1, Orioles. With two down and two on, Pedro Alvarez worked another count deep and earned himself a walk. That loaded the bases once again and Manny Machado was tired of seeing all those ducks on the pond and unloaded a blast to deep left center field. Grand Slam. 7-1, Orioles.    Gallardo would come back in the bottom of the fourth inning and give Orioles fans another collective panic attack. Brad Miller led off with a hard single which Logan Morrison followed with a hard double into the right field corner.    With runners on second and third and one down Steven Souza Jr. hit a hard grounder to third base. Machado for some reason decided to come home with the ball to cut the runner down with a six run lead even though an easy out was at first base. The ball sailed up the first base line allowing the run to score anyways and allowing the runners to move up to second and third with still only one down. 7-2, Orioles. Gallardo would wriggle out the jam after getting Corey Dickerson to foul out to Wieters and getting Bobby Wilson to ground out to Hardy. Birdland exhales. The Orioles would chase Odorizzi after their fourth inning barrage. They were able to work the count like crazy on him. After an 8 pitch first inning, he threw 81 pitches in the next three innings. That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty impressive for an Orioles lineup that has shown some predilection for over aggression.    The Rays were also able to chase Gallardo early. He came out of the came after the fifth inning. Finishing with 95 pitches over 5.0 innings, giving up 5 hits, 2 runs, 1 earned run, 1 walk, and 5 strike outs. A typical five and dive performance save for only two runs given up. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t be happy about it. The Orioles would tack on another run in the top of the 7th inning. This time off of Rays reliever Erasmo Ramirez. With two down, Steve Pearce singled to center field and Wieters walked. Then, Schoop hit a slow roller to shortstop which Nick Franklin air mailed into the stands allowing Pearce to score. 8-2, Orioles. Ramirez would get J.J. Hardy to end the inning. The Orioles added another run in the top of the eighth inning as Adam Jones greeted new Rays reliever Steve Geltz with a massive lead off home run to center field. 9-2, Orioles. That was their third home run of the ballgame. The Orioles would add two more in the top of the ninth inning. A lead off single for Wieters followed by a one out J.J. Hardy walk, followed by a two out Alvarez single which was followed by a Machado single. Two runs scored in the inning. 11-2, Orioles.    The Orioles bullpen would pitch four scoreless innings allowing only four base runners to keep Tampa Bay out of the game as the Orioles offense buried them. The Orioles would win by a final score of 11-2. An absolutely crazy game in New York ended in a Blue Jays loss which means the Oriloles are now only one game back in AL East. Also, on a more negative note. Chris Davis was pulled in the fifth inning of the game tonight with an apparent injury. The Orioles luckily have a roster chock full of first baseman to fill his spot if the injury is serious. Join us here tomorrow at 1:10pm as the Orioles and Dylan Bundy look for the sweep against Drew Smyly and the Rays.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

It\xe2\x80\x99s almost unfathomable that someone could have that much trouble \xe2\x80\x93 and/or be that incredibly unlucky \xe2\x80\x93 over the course of a season.     .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; }     p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYHouston Astros' Alex Bregman is USA TODAY Sports' Minor League Player of the YearRemember, as Joseph progressed through the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 system, he was known more for his bat than his glove. In 2013, his last full season in the minors, Joseph batted .299 with 22 homers and 97 RBI\xc2\xa0at Class AA Bowie (Md.). Heading into this year, he was a .223 hitter with 20 homers and 77 RBI\xc2\xa0in 182 games (parts of two seasons) for the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 not great, but certainly passable for a reserve catcher with strong defensive skills.This year, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 affable back-up backstop has played in 42 games, been to the plate 124 times and registered 117 official at-bats. He has 22 hits, including two doubles, and is batting .188 on the season.He has come to the plate 25 times with runners in scoring position (second base or third base) and has two singles and a walk without plating a run. Consider this: In those 24 official at-bats, Joseph has struck out only five times. So, in 17 times with runners in scoring position this year, he put the ball in play and it went to someone for an out. Incredible.With 24 games remaining in the regular season, Joseph, as the backup to Matt Wieters, will probably get six to eight more starts. That translates to about 25 more plate appearances.It\xe2\x80\x99s likely he receives the start Wednesday afternoon in Tampa, a day game after a night game, because Wieters is going to get two consecutive days off before the Orioles begin a run of 17 straight contests. (Catcher Francisco Pena is also on the active roster.)Joseph, obviously, is aware of the RBI-less situation. He was sent to Class AAA\xc2\xa0Norfolk in August to get more at-bats, and when he drove in a run there, he stood at first base and pantomimed grabbing an imaginary monkey from his back and tossing it to the ground.So Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s sharp sense of humor is intact.In 40 at-bats for the Tides, Joseph had 10 hits and drove in four runs. When he played for Class AA Bowie (Md.) and High-A Frederick (Md.) this year as part of an injury rehab assignment \xe2\x80\x93 he underwent testicular surgery in late May when he was hit with a foul tip \xe2\x80\x93 Joseph drove in seven runs in a combined 46 plate appearances.So he has 11 RBI\xc2\xa0in 2016, just none in the majors.If he does get one \xe2\x80\x93 and only one \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99ll also make baseball history. According to Elias, the most at-bats with just one RBI in a season was 114, set by Minnesota Twins\xe2\x80\x99 infielder Johnny Goryl in 1964. Joseph is already three at-bats ahead of Goryl\xe2\x80\x99s season total.It was Goryl\xe2\x80\x99s 90th at-bat and 38th game of the 1964 season when he dropped a sacrifice bunt in the fourth inning on July 28 against the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 of all teams \xe2\x80\x94 and Hall of Famer Robin Roberts. Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first baseman Norm Siebern picked it up and recorded the unassisted out, but Rich Rollins scored from third to give Goryl a RBI.Goryl played in 20 more games that season, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t plate another run.Joseph still has nearly a month to sidestep infamy \xe2\x80\x93 any maybe even Goryl\xe2\x80\x99s one RBI record \xe2\x80\x93 and he could get another crack at it today.It always seems like when we write about a guy on a hot streak, he inevitably goes cold. So maybe this will be a reverse jinx for Joseph.Connolly writes for\xc2\xa0BaltimoreBaseball.com, an affiliate of USA TODAY Sports Media Group.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE "", 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Listen Live: Orioles VS Rays [Live Audio] MLB - CBS Baltimore', ' Listen live as the Baltimore Orioles take on the Tampa Bay Rays at\xc2\xa0Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Chris Davis and the Baltimore Orioles have padded their numbers at the expense of the Tampa Bay Rays this season. With a homer in each of the first two contests of the series, Davis looks to send the visiting Orioles to a sweep of the cellar-dwelling Rays on Wednesday afternoon as the American League East rivals conclude their set at Tropicana Field. Davis recorded his fifth homer and 13th RBI of 2016 against Tampa Bay in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s 11-2 rout, marking Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s fourth victory in five games overall and 11th in 14 encounters with the Rays. The 30-year-old slugger is 8-for-18 with three blasts, six RBIs and five runs scored during his five-game hitting streak and belted a first-inning grand slam against Wednesday starter Drew Smyly in a 12-5 victory at Camden Yards on June 26. Baltimore, which holds a one-game lead over Detroit for the second wild card, has recorded 30 runs over its last five games while Tampa Bay has endured troubles with its offense all season. As a result, the Rays fired hitting coach Derek Shelton and promoted Chad Mottola to the same position prior to Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s game. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Dylan Bundy (8-5, 3.47 ERA) vs. Rays LH Drew Smyly (6-11, 4.94) Bundy made amends after allowing five runs in four innings at Yankee Stadium on Aug. 27 by scattering two hits over 5 2/3 frames in a 8-0 victory over New York six days later. The 23-year-old rookie may have won two of his last three starts, but his 11 walks leave plenty to be desired. Bundy has come a long way since he made his first major-league start at Tampa Bay on July 17, yielding three homers and four runs over 3 1/3 innings of a 5-2 setback. Smyly may own a 4-0 mark over his last eight starts, but the 27-year-old was fortunate to walk away with a no-decision on Wednesday after permitting five runs in as many innings against Boston. Smyly continues to be plagued by the long ball as he allowed two homers for the second time in three starts and 29 in 26 outings this season. Smyly has enjoyed success in his career versus Baltimore with a 4-1 mark, however he was taken to task for eight runs on 10 hits \xe2\x80\x93 including three homers \xe2\x80\x93 in his last encounter on June 26. WALK-OFFS 1. Baltimore 3B Manny Machado belted a grand slam on Tuesday, raising his homer total to three and RBI tally to nine during his seven-game hitting streak. 2. Tampa Bay CF Kevin Kiermaier is 13-for-41 during his 10-game hitting streak. 3. Rays 2B Logan Forsythe is 10-for-20 in his last five contests.

All five affiliates played their final games on Monday, wrapping up quite the season down on the farm.    There were ups and downs, prospects who shined and rookies who made a very encouraging first-year impact. Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s on to the offseason for dozens and dozens of prospects to perfect their games in preparation for 2016.  With that said, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for a quick recap of the highlights at every level, spotlighting on the guys who made the 2016 minor-league season incredibly exciting to break down. Norfolk Tides Final record: 62-82 It certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the most profitable season for the Orioles AAA club, but the feeder club wasn\xe2\x80\x99t awfully void of talent.     Prospect-wise, our game recaps were very focused on Trey Mancini, who consistently displayed a next-level readiness. In 125 games with the Tides, the 24-year-old compiled a .282 average, hitting 13 home runs and driving in 54 RBI. His on-base percentage finished at .349, second amongst qualifying Tides.    The two outfield prospects, Christian Walker and Dariel Alvarez, spent all season with the club. Walker hit .264 with 18 HRs, while Alvarez consistently sprayed the baseball around with a .288 average. The \xe2\x80\x9csurprise of the club\xe2\x80\x9d award has to be handed to Corban Joseph, who was by far the most impressive piece in the lineup during his 85 games played. He slashed .305/.362/.435, leading the team in average and on-base percentage. While he isn\xe2\x80\x99t a top-30 prospect and he\xe2\x80\x99ll turn 28 this fall, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to deny the impact he had with Norfolk this year.    Pitching was unwatchable throughout the season \xe2\x80\x94 not a surprising fact considering the lack of prospects available at the triple-A level. Of course, Joe Gunkel had an impressive season, but the overall performances from the crop of starters were consistently bad. Oliver Drake, the team\xe2\x80\x99s highest AAA pitching prospect, was decent (2.72 ERA, 1.22 WHIP), but he\xe2\x80\x99ll be 30 at the start of next season. Bowie Baysox Final record: 56-86 Finishing that far under .500 is pretty much all you need to know about this team. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t good to start the season, and they weren\xe2\x80\x99t good to end it.    Chance Sisco was the cream of the crop for the entirety of the season, consistently displaying the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready to take a potential giant next step in 2017. His season was brilliant, hitting .320 over 112 games, leading the team\xe2\x80\x99s regulars with a .406 on-base percentage. In other words: he\xe2\x80\x99s ready. Other than Sisco, the rest of the offense was full of disappointing performances from players completely off the prospect radar.  Garabez Rosa did perform well in his 110 games with the Baysox (.303 average, 8 HR, 62 RBI), but it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to see him contributing with the Orioles at the major-league level. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be 27 at the start of next year. Starter Chris Lee was brilliant through his first eight games, but an injury at the end of May kept him out for the rest of the season. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be someone to watch in 2017, potentially finding his way to earning a few starts at some point. Starting pitching was exhausting in Bowie as well, as no regular starter (other than Lee) had fewer hits than innings pitched on the season. Also, five of the six pitchers who made double-digit starts had ERAs over 4.65. That\xe2\x80\x99s an ugly stat.    Jason Garcia couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take the next step, an unfortunate year for the 23-year-old. The opposition hit .291 against him on the year and walked 54 times in 123.2 innings. Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s WHIP was 1.54 to finish the season, paired with a 4.73 ERA. David Hess, 24th on the top-30 prospect list, was even worse, as he allowed a .310 average against. His walk numbers were slightly lower, but he struggled to miss bats all season long. He finished 5-13 with a 5.37 ERA in 24 starts at the AA level. Frederick Keys Final record: 68-72 Despite a lack of intriguing prospects, Frederick managed to have a decent season season in the Carolina League. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect, but there were a few standout stars. The biggest name here was without a doubt Jomar Reyes, the Orioles #5 prospect. Just 19 years old, Reyes had the bulk of the attention on a nightly basis after a tremendous 2015 with Delmarva. Unfortunately, his 2016 season was marked with disappointment across the board. He hit just .228 on the season, putting together an overall .271 on-base percentage. His walk rate of just 5% was a key contributor to the latter number, but the overall season was a wash for a kid with massive expectations at the onset of the season.     Fireball-throwing reliever Tanner Scott threw 48.1 innings with the Keys this year, but he walked 42 batters in the process. His command hasn\xe2\x80\x99t improved, even if he is still hitting 100 miles per hour. Both Matthew Grimes and John Means began the season with great success, however the leap to double-A seemed to stump both 2014 draft picks. Ultimately, they were the true highlights of Frederick\xe2\x80\x99s starting pitching performances.  Full-season corner infielder Anderlin Rodriguez was by-far the highlight of the Keys season, perhaps the surprise of the O\xe2\x80\x99s minor-league system as a whole. The 24-year-old crushed the ball all season long, finishing the year slashing .304/.359/.532 with 26 home runs and 93 RBI. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear what his future holds, but 2016 was certainly kind to Anderlin. Out of the bullpen, 25th-ranked prospect Garrett Cleavinger was largely a disappointment after his promotion from Delmarva \xe2\x80\x94 he worked in 20 games, struggling with a 4.82 ERA and 1.55 WHIP. Delmarva Shorebirds Final record: 73-66 Now these guys, they were fun. Prospects aplenty, Delmarva was consistently putting up big numbers in the nightly box scores.    19-year-old shortstop Ryan Mountcastle was the most notable prospect who spent his full season in Delmarva, and unlike Reyes, this teenager helped his squad throughout the season with impressive numbers. He hit .281 on the season, slugging .426 with some sparks of power. His development next season will be exciting. Catcher Alex Murphy also showed off in Delmarva, acting as a very reliable catcher behind the dish along with a valuable bat. The Calvert Hall alum slashed .252/.335/.423, leading the team with 63 RBI. How about 16 home runs for a bit of pop, too? As he continues his development, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see how the Orioles view him as a potential trade piece down the line. D.J. Stewart spent the first half of his season here, struggling to be a consistent presence at the dish. However, after being called up to Frederick in June, he hit .279 with a .389 on-base percentage. On the bump, perhaps no starter in the Orioles system was better than 20-year-old Brian Gonzalez. The 6\xe2\x80\x993\xe2\x80\x9d, 230-pound lefty went 10-8 with a 2.50 ERA in 27 starts. He struck out 111 batters in 147.2 innings, allowing just 135 hits. If he can improve command, the 2014 third-round pick is a name that\xe2\x80\x99ll stick at the top of the prospect list. Another 19-year-old (who will start next season the same age, by the way) Ofelky Peralta got a unique look at pitching in professional baseball as well. His first full non-rookie ball season with the Orioles saw issues with free passes (60 walks in 103.1 innings), but he surrendered just 87 hits while striking out 101. All in all, it was a successful opening campaign for a kid who should join Gonzalez as a must-watch arm in 2017.    If you followed any of the minor-league recaps at Camden Chat this year, you know who Yermin Mercedes is. If not, here\xe2\x80\x99s his stat line this year. Enjoy. A dark horse to watch would be 21-year-old righty Cristian Alvarado, who brilliantly navigated through a full 27-start season with the Shorebirds. He paired his 3.41 ERA with a 1.16 WHIP, compiling 148 strikeouts in 148 innings. That\xe2\x80\x99s good, very good. Aberdeen Ironbirds Final record: 32-43 The record doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter in short-season A ball \xe2\x80\x94 what counted this season in Aberdeen was the performances of the prospects, and oh were there prospects to be watched. To keep things simple, here are the bullet-points, prospects in order according to the top-30 list:  Cody Sedlock merely scratched the surface in his pro ball debut, but he certainly proved that his college performance wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fluke. In 27 innings, opposing batters hit just .158 against, striking out 25 times. All eyes will be on #SedlockWatch next season. The Orioles took Matthias Dietz in the second-round, sending him to Aberdeen to work alongside Sedlock. He struggled in 18.2 innings, allowing 22 hits and walking 10. He was a junior college standout, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to form too much of an opinion with such a terribly small sample size. Keegan Akin, another second-round selection, performed near perfectly in Aberdeen, posting a 1.05 ERA and 0.85 WHIP through 26 innings. With just 15 hits allowed and 29 strikeouts compiled, his nine mini-starts were great. Austin Hays, the 21-year-old third-round selection, was fantastic in 38 games played. He dealt with a pesky wrist injury that kept him out for about a month, but his numbers were worth the price of admission when he did play \xe2\x80\x94 .336/.386/.514, 4 HR and 21 RBI. Preston Palmeiro hit .258, knocking in 18 RBI in 34 games. Again, a small sample size, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be noteworthy after his impressive career at N.C. State. Australian-born pitcher Alex Wells nearly overshadowed the performances of the 2016 picks with his overall performance with the Ironbirds through 13 starts. He tossed 62.2 innings, allowing just 48 hits and nine walks. At just 19 years old, it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say he\xe2\x80\x99ll be spotlighted approaching next season.   ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
09/08/2016,"[('MLB Playoffs 2016: The Orioles chances with 23 games ...', ' Wednesday afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles loss to the Rays could hardly have been worse. There are only so many games left and the O\xe2\x80\x99s need to win the winnable games against bad teams. That\xe2\x80\x99s the bad news. The good news is that the three days of baseball just played could hardly have gone better for the Orioles, short of the O\xe2\x80\x99s getting that sweep. One of the teams the Orioles are chasing in the division, the Blue Jays, stumbled and got swept, and since the Orioles won their own series, they made sure that most of the competition coming from below could get no closer to them. Trailing the Jays by just a game for the first wild card spot, and the Red Sox by only two games for the division lead, the Orioles are not out of hope for passing either one of those teams, or potentially even both. They will be playing one another this weekend, giving the Orioles prime chance of gaining ground if they can play well. The Orioles are going to need to play well for their wild card spot\xe2\x80\x99s sake this weekend, too. The Detroit Tigers, now one game behind the O\xe2\x80\x99s for that playoff spot, await the Orioles for a crucial and potentially decisive showdown.    Through Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s results, the Fangraphs standings predictions still think that the Orioles, finishing with 88 wins, will take the second wild card spot. We\xe2\x80\x99ll stick with that until finding out something different.    Baltimore Orioles  Wild Card Standing: Road wild card team; one game behind Jays for home spot Yesterday: Lost to Rays, 7-6 Next series: at Tigers (75-64), three games  Current playoff chances: 46.1% (up from 37.2 before Monday\xe2\x80\x99s games) To reach 88 wins: 12-11  Detroit Tigers  Wild Card Standing: One game behind Orioles Yesterday: Lost to White Sox, 7-4 Next series: vs. Orioles (76-63), three games Current playoff chances: 45.9% (down from 57) To reach 88 wins: 13-10  Houston Astros  Wild Card Standing: Two games behind Orioles Yesterday: Lost to Indians, 6-5 Next series: at Indians today, then at Twins (52-88), three games Current playoff chances: 22.4% (up from 18.3) To reach 88 wins: 14-9  New York Yankees  Wild Card Standing: 2.5 games behind Orioles Yesterday: Beat Blue Jays, 2-0 Next series: vs. Rays (59-79), four games Current playoff chances: 8.5% (up from 2.6) To reach 88 wins: 15-9  Kansas City Royals  Wild Card Standing: Four games behind Orioles Yesterday: Lost to Twins, 6-5 Next series: at White Sox (67-72), three games Current playoff chances: 3.5% (up from 2.6) To reach 88 wins: 16-7  With apologies to the Mariners, I\xe2\x80\x99m digging the wild card grave for them for the year. Although their postseason chance is the same as the Royals (3.5%) they are now five games back with 23 games to play and five teams to pass. If they pull off a sweep this weekend, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put them back in the picture. It\xe2\x80\x99s still something of a question whether 88 wins will really be enough to win this thing. And by \xe2\x80\x9cthis thing\xe2\x80\x9d I really mean the right to go on the road for a one game winner-take-all wild card game, which, what is that even worth, really? Maybe the Orioles used up all of their wild card game good luck four years ago!    All that the Orioles have to do to get to 88 wins now is win more games than they lose.  However, only seven of their final 23 games will be against non-contenders, and 12 of the final 23 will be played on the road. The fact that the Orioles will be playing the Tigers this weekend gives them a great opportunity to put some daylight on their closest competitor. All of these other teams in the race will be playing non-contenders this weekend, though, so they likely aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to shake any of them over the next three days. The Orioles have better postseason chances than they did three days ago. That\xe2\x80\x99s good, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll be better still if they can improve on that three days from now. And of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s only the way the standings look in three weeks time that really matters.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Chris Davis added a two-run shot later in the inning, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s led 3-0.At some point, it entered your mind that the Orioles wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t score much more than this and that Detroit would simply chip away at the lead. That thought was especially prevelant when J.D. Martinez cut the lead to 3-1 on an RBI-single in the last of the first.

That ran the score to 11-2, and sent most of the Comerica Park crowd for the exits. Detroit had scheduled a fireworks night, but many people didn\xe2\x80\x99t stay around for that. Detroit would add one additional run in the eighth, but this was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 night in the motor city.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

The series is now split, making this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s rubber match very important. The Orioles chased Detroit starter Jordan Zimmerman very early in this game, however given the fact that rosters are 40 players now they don\xe2\x80\x99t get the luxury of having tired out Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen. There are more where that came from in a sense.The series will conclude this afternoon, with Chris Tillman making his return from the DL in order to make the start. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by none other than Justin Verlander, in what should be a great pitching match-up. Game time is set for just after 1 PM.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles fall on a late Detroit home run at Comerica ParkI\xe2\x80\x99d be remiss if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. As you follow baseball and perhaps football today, take a moment and remember the victims of those senseless attacks on that September day a decade-and-a-half ago. May we never forget the countless innocents who perished that day, nor the bravery that we saw \xe2\x80\x93 both then and in the subsequent years by our armed services. May the victims rest in peace, and may God continue to bless America. "", 'birdswatcher.com')]"

an NFL game.It started with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sitting, and later kneeling, during the national anthem during the NFL exhibition season. He was soon joined by teammate Eric Reid. It extended to Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall before Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s NFL season opener.By Sunday, there were four NFL teams with players expressing silent protests, including Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty of the New England Patriots, who stood with raised fists following the anthem.Yet, since that Aug. 26 day when Kaepernick gained attention for his protest against racial inequality in this country - with his season opener scheduled Monday night against the Los Angeles Rams - there have been nearly 250 Major League Baseball games played, and not a single player has taken a stand.Or, in this case, a knee.This is the sport that launched the civil rights movement when Jackie Robinson integrated the game of baseball on April 15, 1947, finally breaking the color barrier.Now, at a time when even entire high school football teams and soccer players are waging silent protests by sitting or kneeling during the national anthem, there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a single protest in baseball.Perhaps someone is quietly sitting on the dugout bench, or even lingering in the clubhouse until the national anthem is over, but no one has publicly made their intentions known.Why?\xe2\x80\x9cWe already have two strikes against us already,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Baltimore Orioles All-Star center fielder Adam Jones told USA TODAY Sports, \xe2\x80\x9cso you might as well not kick yourself out of the game. In football, you can\xe2\x80\x99t kick them out. You need those players. In baseball, they don\xe2\x80\x99t need us.\xe2\x80\x9cBaseball is a white man\xe2\x80\x99s sport.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Indeed, African Americans comprise 68% of the player population in the NFL, and 74% in the NBA. That number is\xc2\xa0just 8% in baseball, with only 69 African-Americans on the opening-day rosters and disabled lists this season.     .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; }     p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYWhy Rick Porcello\xe2\x80\x99s 20th win deserves more acclaimThis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that anyone who protests racial inequality or police brutality will be released from their teams, or banished from baseball, never to wear a uniform again. Still, in the conservative world of baseball, whose players stand 162 times for the national anthem, playing in front of more fans than any sport in the country, they could face much more ridicule and ostracization.Jones, 31, one of the most outspoken and passionate African-American players in baseball, certainly empathizes with the injustices that minorities face every day in this country. He sees and hears too many incidents of police brutality in his own city that have unfairly targeted minorities, and was an important voice in the aftermath of protests that followed the death in police custody of Freddie Gray, a series of events that compelled the Orioles to play a 2015 game in front of an empty stadium.Jones would like to see change, too, but Sunday, just like every other day, he stood at attention during the national anthem before their game against the Detroit Tigers, with his right hand over his heart.\xe2\x80\x9cHe believes in what he believes in,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Jones says of Kaepernick, \xe2\x80\x9cand as a man of faith, as an American who has rights, who am I to say he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9cKaepernick is not disrespecting the military. He\xe2\x80\x99s not disrespecting people who they\xe2\x80\x99re fighting. What he\xe2\x80\x99s doing is showing that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the social injustice that the flag represents.\xe2\x80\x9cLook, I know a lot of people who don\xe2\x80\x99t even know the words to the national anthem. You know how many times I see people stand up for the national anthem and not pay attention. They stand because they\xe2\x80\x99re told to stand.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the problem. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t do something because you\xe2\x80\x99re told to do something. Do it because you understand the meaning behind it and the sacrifice behind it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Whether you agree or disagree with Kaepernick\xe2\x80\x99s method to draw attention to the inequalities in this country, Jones is dismayed how the public views Kaepernick compared to 49er teammates. Go ahead, check out the difference in coverage since Kapernick sat during the national anthem compared to his teammate, Bruce Miller. Miller was arrested last week and charged with aggravated assault, elder abuse, threats and battery against 70-year-old man and his 29-year-old son. The 49ers later released him.\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s my thing,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Jones says, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s somebody on the 49ers\xe2\x80\x99 team that commits an act like that, accosts a 70-year-old man and his kid, and nobody\xe2\x80\x99s talking about that. But they talk about Kaepernick doing something that he believes in, as his right as an American citizen. People need to talk more about that guy than Kaepernick.\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not receiving the ridicule and public torture that Kaepernick is facing. Is Kaepernick hurting me? No. Is he hurting random people out there? No. I support his decision.\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the day, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t respect his freedoms, then why the hell are we Americans? It\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be the Land of the Free, right?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99     .oembed-asset-link { background: #fff; border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail{ float: left; padding: 14px; }     .oembed-link-thumbnail img { max-width: 78px; max-height: 60px; display: block; }     p.oembed-link-title { font-size: 75%; color: #009BFF; margin: 0 14px; padding-top: 12px; font-weight:normal; text-align: left; line-height: 120%;  }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } USA TODAYJustin Verlander has it all \xe2\x80\x94 including, once again, dominance on the moundJones, who was honored last week by receiving the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 nomination for the prestigious Roberto Clemente award for his community involvement, philanthropy and contributions, may have chosen a different way to express his views about racial inequality in this country. Yet, his heart aches over the public outrage and abuse Kaepernick has received.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Kaepernick called the N-word,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Jones said, \xe2\x80\x9cjust because he\xe2\x80\x99s being sensitive to what has happened to African-Americans in this country. It\xe2\x80\x99s crazy how when people of color speak up, we\xe2\x80\x99re always ridiculed. But when people that are not of color speak up, it\xe2\x80\x99s their right.\xe2\x80\x9cThe First Amendment says we have freedom of expression. We\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be so free, so free. But any time anybody of color speaks up in the United States, for some odd reason, they always get the raw end of the deal. It sucks.\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the day, black men have fought for this right. Indians have fought for this right. White people fought for this right. Mexicans have fought for this right. Japanese have fought this for this right. The United States was not just made up of one race.\xe2\x80\x9cSo let\xe2\x80\x99s just not say that in America, only one person can say something. We all have input because America has always been a country that has united everybody.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99The problem, Jones says, is that most fans don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear their athletes share their opinions outside the sports world. They\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to talk about race, religion, political views, or anything that could create ill will, or discomfort among the fan base. You know, stick to sports.\xe2\x80\x9cThe outside world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really respect athletes,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Jones says, \xe2\x80\x9cunless they talk about what they want them to talk about. Society doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think we deserve the right to have an opinion on social issues.\xe2\x80\x9cWe make a lot of money, so we just have to talk baseball, talk football. But most athletes, especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re tenured in your sport, you\xe2\x80\x99re educated on life, and on more things than most people on the outside. But because Donald Trump is a billionaire, he can say whatever he wants, because he\xe2\x80\x99s older and has more money?\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when Kaepernick does something, or says something, he\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculed. Why is that? \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali, Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown, Olympians John Carlos and Tommie Smith and NBA Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar all spoke out about racial inequalities. All survived the public storm of criticism, though some paid a heavier price.Even Jackie Robinson, the man who Martin Luther King even credited for starting the civil rights movement, became a strong advocate for racial equality during his career and afterwards, and even voiced his opinion about the national anthem in his 1972 autobiography, I Never Had it Made.\xe2\x80\x9cAs I write this \xe2\x80\xa6I cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag; I know that I am a black man in a white world. In 1972, in 1947, at my birth in 1919, I know that I never had it made.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99Once again, Robinson was ahead of his time, opening plenty of doors, but nearly 70 years later, so many are still closed. It provoked Kaepernick to publicly display his discontent, with the movement spreading, and causing everyone to take notice. Due to love or loathing, Kaepernick\xe2\x80\x99s social media presence has increased 35,000% since he spoke up.In these final three weeks of the regular season, during the postseason, or perhaps even on the national stage of the World Series, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if any baseball player now dares to take a stand.\xe2\x80\x9cNo one has done it, yet,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Jones says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s the key word here: Yet.\xe2\x80\x9cWe will see.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99GALLERY: MLB photo of the dayFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInMLB photo of the day\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

09/13/2016,"[('It\\u2019s time to give up on the Wade Miley experiment - Camden ...', "" The Orioles got walloped by the Red Sox last night 12-2 and Wade Miley\xe2\x80\x99s pitching was a big reason for it. He was awful. The lefty\xe2\x80\x99s struggles are reaching the point where it may make the most sense to simply banish him to the bullpen and try again in the spring.    Miley came to Baltimore from Seattle back on July 31 in exchange for 27-year-old farmhand Ariel Miranda. So, with all due respect to Miranda, it seemed like a pretty low-risk deal. Wade was bad with the Mariners; 7-8, 4.98 ERA, 82 ERA+, 4.76 FIP over 19 games. He has been worse with the Orioles. Like, much, much worse; 1-5, 7.15 ERA, 63 ERA+, 4.79 FIP over seven games. And those numbers were taken prior to Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s disaster. To open a crucial three-game series with Boston on Monday, Miley took the hill, but wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay long. Over just 1.1 innings of work, he gave up six runs on eight hits and one walk without striking anyone out. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the line of a major league-caliber pitcher. That is a \xe2\x80\x9cdesignated-for-assignment-type performance.  Of course, Miley won\xe2\x80\x99t be DFA\xe2\x80\x99ed. If the Birds had someone markedly better than him, they would already be on the roster at this point. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t. Plus, Miley\xe2\x80\x99s contract runs through next season and could even be extended if the O\xe2\x80\x99s pick up the $12 million option for 2018. Right now, that seems like an unlikely scenario, but if he can rebound next year and even be league-average then it would be a heck of a bargain, especially for a left-hander.    With Chris Tillman back from injury, the Orioles rotation is pretty well defined. Kevin Gausman may be the staff\xe2\x80\x99s best pitcher. Dylan Bundy has shown he can be reliable. Yovani Gallardo is unspectacular but tends to keep the team in the game. Heck, even Ubaldo Jimenez looks good. And someone like Tyler Wilson or Vance Worley could do a job if needed. Miley is surplus to requirements. So, why keep trotting him out there every fifth day? Because he throws with his left hand? That\xe2\x80\x99s not a good reason.    Only 19 games remain in the 2016 season. According to MLB.com, the Orioles have a 56.7 percent chance of getting to the playoffs. That\xe2\x80\x99s not too bad, but to do that they need to win most of their final games of the year. Over Miley\xe2\x80\x99s eight starts with the O\xe2\x80\x99s, the team is 2-6, a .250 winning percentage. In those two wins, they just barely outscored opponents 18-15. Yeah, to win a game Miley pitches, the Birds need eight or nine runs per game. Nah, that\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna work. Our tweet pretty much sums it up:   The Orioles need to go 10-10 to reach 88 wins, or 10-7 in every game where Wade Miley isn't pitching.\xe2\x80\x94 Camden Chat (@CamdenChat) September 12, 2016    Oh, and there is this one!   With Wade Miley's start tonight, I declare Operation:  Just Not Try to Be Too Horrible a complete failure.\xe2\x80\x94 Dan Szymborski (@DSzymborski) September 13, 2016    And this:    if I was as bad at my job as Wade Miley is at his, I would be fired\xe2\x80\x94 Orioles Memes (@OriolesMemes) September 12, 2016    It\xe2\x80\x99s really that simple. Miley joined the Orioles at a time where the pitching staff was in ruins. All he had to do was be serviceable. But he has been unable to do so. And since he was brought into the fold, those around him have improved while he has become the weak link.    Every game is important at this point in the season and the Orioles have a razor-thin margin or error. Removing Miley from the equation for the final three weeks gives the O\xe2\x80\x99s a better chance of winning in two or three more ball games this year. That could very well be the difference between playoff baseball and an early vacation. Oh, and before anyone else mentions it, Miranda pitched for the Mariners last night too and threw six shutout innings against the Angels. Over eight appearances with Seattle, the lefty is 4-1 with a 3.63 ERA. He had tossed only two innings for the O\xe2\x80\x99s back in July. So, this trade may have actually been more of a risk than originally believed, especially if Miley\xe2\x80\x99s pitching costs the Orioles a shot at October baseball.     "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The lefty gave up five runs on four hits and two walks before being pulled in favor of Heath Hembree.Bogaerts led off the bottom of the fifth with a solo home run to cut the Orioles lead to 5-3. Ortiz singled in the next at bat and moved to second on a Stubbs error, but Bundy would get the next three batters to pop out to end the threat.Bundy would work into the sixth inning, giving up a walk to Chris Young and getting Jackie Bradley Jr. to pop out before being relieved by Tommy Hunter. Bundy threw 95 pitches, 61 for strikes, giving up three runs on six hits and four walks while picking up four strikeouts. Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s fastball was consistently hitting 95-96 mph which is a good sign considering many felt he was starting to wear down as the regular season comes to a close.Baltimore had a chance to add some insurance runs with two outs in the top of the eighth. The O\xe2\x80\x99s were able to load the bases, but Adam Jones struck out to end the inning. Not to worry, they did get that add-on run in the ninth as Schoop drilled his 24th homer of the year out of Fenway Park.The combination of Hunter, Donnie Hart, Brad Brach and Britton closed the door on the Red Sox offense to preserve the win. Britton needed four outs to get his 42nd save of the season and went through the heart of the order to do so.

The Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles own two of the most powerful offenses in baseball, and the team with the most home runs has taken each of the first two games in the series. The Red Sox will try to launch the most over the wall in their own park and maintain their lead in the American League East when they host the Orioles in the rubber match on Wednesday. Boston slugged three home runs in its 12-2, series-opening win on Monday and added another on Tuesday, but it was not enough to overcome Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s three blasts. The Orioles put up five runs in the second inning on Tuesday on the strength of the home run ball and went onto a 6-3 victory, which pushed them into a tie with the Toronto Blue Jays for the two wild card spots in the AL \xe2\x80\x94 two games ahead of the chasing New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers. The Red Sox sit two games clear of Baltimore and Toronto, four games ahead of New York, in the East but are down to eight home games left in the regular season. The Orioles return home for 11 straight after finishing up in Boston and will host losing teams Tampa Bay and Arizona on the homestand in addition to four games against the Red Sox. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (7-10, 3.61 ERA) vs. Red Sox RH Rick Porcello (20-3, 3.21) Gausman is 4-0 in his last five starts, with the lone no decision coming at Detroit on Friday. The LSU product turned in three straight scoreless starts before allowing three runs and seven hits to the Tigers over six innings. Gausman suffered through a pair of terrible starts against Boston in the first half of the season, allowing five runs in six innings at home on May 31 and managing only three frames while getting rocked for six runs in a loss at Fenway Park on June 15. Porcello became the first pitcher this season and the first Red Sox pitcher since Josh Beckett in 2007 to reach 20 wins when he held the Blue Jays to two runs on six hits in seven innings on Friday. That marked the ninth consecutive start in which the Cy Young candidate went at least seven innings and allowed three or fewer earned runs. Porcello, who is 13-0 at Fenway Park this season, struggled at Baltimore on June 2 and was charged with five runs on six hits \xe2\x80\x93 three home runs \xe2\x80\x93 over six innings in a no decision. WALK-OFFS 1. Red Sox 2B Dustin Pedroia recorded multiple hits in 14 of the last 17 games and is 21-for-31 in his last seven home games. 2. Baltimore OF Steve Pearce (elbow, forearm) sat out Tuesday and is day-to-day. 3.

The Baltimore Orioles are surging toward the top of the American League East again and will try to take advantage of the 11-game homestand squarely in front of them to seal a playoff spot. The Orioles look to remain unbeaten against the Tampa Bay Rays at home this season when they host their AL East rivals on Thursday in the opener of a four-game set. Baltimore, which trails first-place Boston by one game in the division, has recorded seven straight wins \xe2\x80\x93 six in 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 against the Rays at Camden Yards and owns one of the best records at home in the major leagues (45-25). The Orioles host Boston next week after attempting to improve on an 11-4 record versus last-place Tampa Bay, which is coming off its first road series win since July 18-20. Baltimore leads the majors with 232 homers while the Rays belted a pair in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 8-1 triumph at Toronto to set a franchise record with 200 blasts. Corey Dickerson has launched 20 of those and has been hot of late, going 16-for-31 with eight RBIs during his eight-game hitting streak. TV: 7:05 p.m. ET, FSN Sun (Tampa Bay), MASN (Baltimore) PITCHING MATCHUP: Rays LH Blake Snell (5-8, 3.62 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Yovani Gallardo (5-7, 5.44) Snell has lost three of his last four starts and did not complete four innings in any of those defeats. The Seattle native, who has not finished six frames in seven of his last eight outings, has served up five homers in 16 games but walked 45 in 77 innings overall. Snell, who will face Baltimore for the first time in his career, is 3-3 in seven starts against AL East opponents during his rookie campaign. Gallardo has permitted three or fewer earned runs in seven of his last nine contests but is just 2-5 in that stretch. The 30-year-old Mexican won at Tampa Bay last time out to snap a four-game losing streak, yielding two runs \xe2\x80\x93 one earned \xe2\x80\x93 and five hits in five innings. Dickerson is 5-for-11 with a homer versus Gallardo, who is 3-1 with a 3.55 ERA in six career starts against the Rays. WALK-OFFS 1. Tampa Bay 3B Evan Longoria, who is batting .193 with three homers against Baltimore this season, is one away from his career high of 33 blasts set in 2009. 2. Baltimore RF Mark Trumbo reached 100 RBIs for the second time in his career on Wednesday with his major league-leading 42nd homer. 3. Rays SS Alexei Ramirez is 3-for-13 for a homer and three RBIs in four games since being signed as a free agent.

According to a stat on last night\xe2\x80\x99s MASN O\xe2\x80\x99s Xtra post-game show, it was the Orioles best road trip of the past 18 years: The only time since 1998 that they\xe2\x80\x99ve won three series in a road trip.    As a result of that 6-3 road trip, many doors are open to the Orioles that we may have long assumed were closed. For several weeks now, the O\xe2\x80\x99s playoff path has seemed to be pretty much limited to the second wild card spot. Could they play well enough to hold off the charging teams coming up from below them? Yet the way that things have worked out, with the Orioles getting hot again as other teams start to run into some problems, it\xe2\x80\x99s going better than that, for now. The Orioles are now ahead of the Blue Jays for the #1 wild card spot and they\xe2\x80\x99re just a game behind the Red Sox for the AL East lead. All those teams charging up are Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s problem at this moment. The Red Sox play the Yankees four games this weekend while the Orioles play the Rays. They\xe2\x80\x99ve still got to play the games and they\xe2\x80\x99ve still got to do their best, but that seems to be in the O\xe2\x80\x99s favor.    The Orioles have 17 games left to play. Eleven of those games will be against playoff contenders, but eleven of them will also be at home, where they have played well.    The Fangraphs standings prediction has shifted. They now think the Orioles and Blue Jays will tie for the wild card spots at 89 wins. That would still put the O\xe2\x80\x99s as the second wild card team. Unless they sweep the Jays in the penultimate series, the Jays will hold the tiebreaker for home field advantage. The Red Sox are projected to take the AL East with 91 wins. Boston Red Sox  Standing: AL East leader; one game ahead of Orioles Yesterday: Lost to Orioles, 1-0 Next series: vs. Yankees (77-68), four games  Current playoff chances: 91.1% To reach 91 wins: 10-7  It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be weird rooting for the Yankees for the weekend, but you know what? The Yankees will still be the incarnate of all evil in the sports world on Monday and the Orioles COULD be in first place. I will happily hate the Yankees from first place. The Orioles have to hold up their part too, of course.    Baltimore Orioles  Standing: Home wild card team; one game behind Red Sox for AL East Yesterday: Beat Red Sox, 1-0 Next series: vs. Rays (62-83), four games Current playoff chances: 66.1% (up from 54.4 before Monday\xe2\x80\x99s games) To reach 91 / 89 wins: 11-6 / 9-8  Winning fewer than three out of four against the Rays is going to feel like a disappointment. I\xe2\x80\x99m as nervous about this series as I was for the Red Sox one. It could be a trap. Toronto Blue Jays  Standing: Road wild card team; one game behind Orioles Yesterday: Lost to Rays, 8-1 Next series: at Angels (63-82), four games Current playoff chances: 63.1% (down from 73.6) To reach 89 wins: 10-7  The Jays are 37-34 on the road. They\xe2\x80\x99re swinging west for seven games, including four against the Angels and three against the Mariners, who\xe2\x80\x99ve won nine of ten. This weekend is their prime chance to get themselves back in the game. Detroit Tigers  Standing: One game behind Blue Jays for second wild card Yesterday: Beat Twins, 9-6 Next series: One game vs. Twins today, then at Indians (84-61), three games Current playoff chances: 37.7% (down from 45.9) To reach 89 wins: 11-6  Seven of the Tigers last seventeen games will come against their division leader, the Indians. Another seven come against the two worst teams in baseball, the Twins and the Braves, including their last three games of the year. For now, this is Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s problem.    Seattle Mariners  Standing: 1.5 games behind Blue Jays Yesterday: Beat Angels, 2-1 Next series: vs. Astros (76-70), three games Current playoff chances: 26.3% (up from 11.8) To reach 89 wins: 11-5  The Mariners have now won nine out of ten to get themselves to where they are in this picture. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to keep winning games at an incredible pace to stay in this thing. It can be done, especially since they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to take games out of the Jays this weekend. New York Yankees  Standing: Two games behind Blue Jays Yesterday: Lost to Dodgers, 2-0 Next series: at Red Sox (81-64), four games Current playoff chances: 9.4% (down from 13.4) To reach 89 wins: 12-5  As my friend and fellow Camden Chatter Stacey Folkemer said to me earlier today, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather the Orioles get the division and the Yankees get the wild card, than the Orioles get the wild card and the Yankees miss the playoffs.\xe2\x80\x9d So, for just the next four games... go Yankees?

09/16/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Late comeback attemp fails as Birds ...', ""The Baltimore Orioles made an attempt at a late comeback last night against Tampa, but it fell short and the Birds fell in game one of four.The Baltimore Orioles seem to be one of those teams that can play up or down to their competition. After taking two-of-three in Boston, one would have thought that coming home to play Tampa would have been easy. But the fact is that there are no easy games in baseball \xe2\x80\x93 and the Orioles know that. You always have to be on your best game, because\xc2\xa0the wolf is always at the door.Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s well aware of their role in the remainder of this season: foil anyone\xe2\x80\x99s plans that you can. That\xe2\x80\x99s evidenced by the way that Kevin Keirmaier seems to run down every ball that\xe2\x80\x99s in the air. I think he could go from foul line to foul line and still get to whatever the Orioles hit last night. But this is a role with which Orioles fans are very familiar (spoiler, that is), and to their credit Tampa is playing it well.Yovani Gallado struggled with control, which seemingly equaled an early exit for him. Gallardo\xe2\x80\x99s line: 3.1 IP, 7 H, 6 R, 2 BB, 7 K. It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting if you think about it; Gallardo struggled with control, yet he tallied seven strikeouts in those 3.1 innings. However he put the Orioles in an immediate hole when he allowed a three-run homer in the first inning to Evan Longoria.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley The Baltimore WireCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireBut the Orioles bounced right back.

Logan Forsythe\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single one inning later tied the game back up at four, and Steven Souza\xe2\x80\x99s softly-hit RBI-single in the third gave Tampa the lead back at 5-4.Tampa would add two more to that tally on Evan Longoria\xe2\x80\x99s two-RBI single in the fourth, putting the Orioles in a 7-4 hole. However late in the game they threatened to come back. J.J. Hardy and Michael Bourn each grounded out in the last of the eighth, driving in a run.

The Tampa Bay Rays are making quite an impact on the American League East race from last place and look to cause some more damage when they visit the Baltimore Orioles on Friday. The Rays have won four of their last five contests \xe2\x80\x93 all against teams in the chase for the division crown \xe2\x80\x93 after edging the Orioles 7-6 on Thursday in the opener of their four-game series. Tampa Bay, which took two of three from Toronto and the finale against the New York Yankees on its current road trip, snapped a seven-game losing streak at Camden Yards as Evan Longoria hit his career high-tying 33rd homer and knocked in five runs. Chris Archer goes to the mound Friday trying to avoid a club-record 19th loss for the Rays and attempting to keep the major league\xe2\x80\x99s best home run-hitting team in check for the second straight night. The Orioles, who occupy one of the two AL wild-card spots, trail Boston by two games in the East after stranding a runner at third in the ninth inning and going without a blast on Thursday. Veteran Ubaldo Jimenez goes for Baltimore on Friday after winning each of his last two starts, including a complete-game gem at Tampa Bay almost two weeks ago. TV: 7:05 p.m. ET, FSN Sun (Tampa Bay), MASN2 (Baltimore) PITCHING MATCHUP: Rays RH Chris Archer (8-18, 4.05 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Ubaldo Jimenez (7-11, 5.98) Archer has equaled Tanyon Sturtze\xe2\x80\x99s club record for losses in a season but has pitched well over the last two months, allowing three runs or fewer in nine of 10 starts. The 27-year-old is just 4-5 during that stretch after yielding three runs over seven innings in a loss to New York last Friday. Jonathan Schoop is 5-for-13 with a homer versus Archer, who is 3-6 with a 4.52 ERA lifetime against the Orioles. Jimenez has been solid in his last four starts, permitting nine runs and 16 hits over 28 2/3 innings. The 32-year-old Dominican, who has posted a 3.24 ERA since the All-Star break, held the Rays to three runs and two hits on Sept. 3 for his ninth career complete game. Jimenez has kept Longoria under control (2-for-13, five strikeouts) and owns a 5-2 record against Tampa Bay with a 2.89 ERA in seven career contests. WALK-OFFS 1.

The Orioles are locked in a duel for the top spot in the AL East and competing for, at worst, one of the two wild cards.Tampa Bay went up 4-0 in the second inning and fell behind 5-4 in the eighth before nearly pulling even in the ninth against Baltimore\'s perfect closer, Zach Britton.With two outs, Mike Mahtook singled off the second base bag. Alexei Ramirez followed with a liner to left, and Mahtook wheeled toward home. The relay from Michael Bourn to third baseman Manny Machado to catcher Matt Wieters easily beat him there.""I knew it was going to be close, just based on the way Alexi hit the ball,"" Mahtook said. ""Left-field line, it wasn\'t like he had super long way to run for it. I was on the move, he made a good play, and they were able to get me.""Evan Longoria hit his career-high 34th homer and Richie Shaffer also connected for the last-place Rays.Tampa Bay starter Chris Archer allowed three runs in 6 1/3 innings and struck out four to increase his AL-leading total to 221. The 18-game loser also avoided setting a franchise record for losses in a season.""Can\'t say I\'m pleased with the way things went,"" the right-hander said. ""We lost the game.""Archer was replaced after giving up successive one-out singles in the seventh. Danny Farquhar hit Adam Jones with a pitch to load the bases for Hyun Soo Kim, who hit a deep liner to center. Kevin Kiermaier leaped with his back to the 7-foot wall, grasped the ball and brought it back onto the field before it popped from his glove.""That\'s a grand slam with any other center fielder,"" Rays manager Kevin Cash said.Kim was limited to an RBI single, and Farquhar struck out Machado and Davis.But Baltimore would not be denied in the eighth against wild reliever Brad Boxberger (4-2).Two walks and a hit batter loaded the bases for J.J. Hardy, who tied it with an infield single. Bourn followed with a fly ball to left field, and pinch-runner Nolan Reimold easily scored as the throw was cut off.Brad Brach (9-3) worked the eighth and Britton escaped with his 44th save in 44 tries.""If we get to where we\'re looking for,"" Orioles starter Ubaldo Jimenez said, ""it\'s one of those games that you can point out: What was the game that made the difference?""Longoria homered off Ubaldo Jimenez with a man on in the first inning and Shaffer went deep in the second for a 4-0 lead.Pedro Alvarez hit his 21st home run in the second for Baltimore and Chris Davis delivered No. 38 in the fourth. Davis also struck out twice and has 201 for the year.Baltimore\'s Mark Trumbo, the major league home run leader with 42, was sidelined with back spasms. It was only the second game he\'s missed this season.OUT IN LEFT FIELDBrad Miller usually plays shortstop or first base for the Rays. In an effort to gauge Miller\'s versatility and add flexibility to the roster, Cash started him in left field.It didn\'t take long for Miller to get noticed: The second Baltimore batter of the game hit a pop to left that glanced off Miller\'s glove for an error.The glove was borrowed from Farquhar.TRAINER\'S ROOMRays: 1B Nick Franklin, who strained his hamstring on Thursday, was held from the game. Cash listed him day-to-day.Orioles: RHP Darren O\'Day (rotator cuff strain) threw 26 pitches in a simulated game and could be activated Sunday or Monday. ...

09/17/2016,"[('Baltimore Orioles: A new star is Bourn in the outfield', ""It took a relay throw from Michael Bourn in the outfielder to nail a runner at the plate for the Baltimore Orioles to finally put Tampa out of their misery.The Baltimore Orioles just acquired outfielder Michael Bourn a few weeks ago, but if he does nothing else in an Oriole uniform he\xe2\x80\x99ll have already made a huge impact. The Birds had slowly crawled back into a game in which they had trailed from the beginning last night against a team in Tampa that they needed to and should have beaten. However Tampa, the masters of\xc2\xa0anything you can do I can do better, just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away. Alexi Ramirez\xe2\x80\x99s ninth-inning single with two outs appeared to be their normal shennanigans in that it appeared to be a game-tying play.Ubaldo Jimenez struggled early, but righted himself last night. However at the time, it appeared the damage might have already been done. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7.0 IP, 7 H, 4 R, 0 BB, 8 K. Jimenez might have been getting too much of the plate if anything \xe2\x80\x93 evidenced by two-run homers by Longoria and Shaffer in the first and second innings respectively.However the O\xe2\x80\x99s began to get back in the game in the last of the second when Pedro Alvarez smacked a solo home run. Chris Davis followed suit two innings later, hitting his \xc2\xa0solo shot to the opposite field. Hyun-Soo Kim\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single in the seventh brought the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within one, and Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent RBI-single an inning later tied the game at four.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley The Baltimore WireCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireHowever it was Bourn who gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s the lead, and who would eventually preserve that lead. His eighth inning sac fly-RBI scored the go-ahead run, and the Orioles led 5-4. However there was still some late drama in this game, and at the end of the day both Bourn and the entire Orioles team were up to the task.With two outs in the ninth inning, closer Zach Britton had Alexei Ramirez with a full count \xe2\x80\x93 down to his final strike. As if Tampa hasn\xe2\x80\x99t caused the Orioles enough problems by running down all of their would-be extra-base hits and so forth, Ramirez sent a tight grounded past third. With a runner at second base, it appeared that the game was going to be tied and that Britton was going to blow his first save of the season\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6it\xc2\xa0appeared that way, at least. With almost cat-like reflexes, Bourn hustled over to the ball and dug it out of the corner. Mike Mahtook (the runner at second) didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the best read on the ball and held up a bit \xe2\x80\x93 giving Bourn time to get to it. Bourn made a near-perfect throw to Manny Machado at third, who relayed it home to catcher Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and\xc2\xa0BOOM! Mahtook was out at home plate. That\xe2\x80\x99s how the game ended, and the Orioles kept pace in the chase for October. The key to that play is Bourn getting to the ball as expediantly as he did, and then making such a great throw. And it really illustrates why Buck Showalter is so big on defense. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a part of the game that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to sacrifice.More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerThat might be as big of an individual play as the Orioles have made this season. You never want to say that the Birds are in a spot where they need to win the rest of their games, because that\xe2\x80\x99s neither true nor possible. However many of these other teams refuse to lose, putting pressure on the Birds. With the line between success and failure this year being so fine, it\xe2\x80\x99s plays like that which you need in your favor to keep the season going.And as I said above, it was almost Zach Britton\xe2\x80\x99s first blown save of the season. Brad Brach actually got the win (as the pitcher of record when Bourn gave the Birds the lead), however Britton came in during the ninth inning. As good as Britton\xe2\x80\x99s been, he probably deserved to have his streak saved by someone else in that spot. And Bourn was most definitely up to the challenge.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Late comeback attempt fails as Birds fall to TampaThe series continues this evening at Oriole Park. Chris Tillman takes to the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s Matt Andriese. Game time is set for just after 7 PM. "", 'birdswatcher.com')]"
09/18/2016,"[('Odorizzi does his part in Rays 2-1 loss to Orioles', 'Tampa Bay Rays manager Kevin Cash stands in the dugout in the ninth inning of a baseball game against the Baltimore Orioles in Baltimore, Sunday, Sept. 18, 2016. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Wins and losses have been elusive for Jake Odorizzi, who\'s experienced a very strange season with the Tampa Bay Rays.Odorizzi pitched well enough to win Sunday, yet the result was familiar: a no-decision in the Rays\' 2-1 defeat against the Baltimore Orioles.It was the 16th start in which Odorizzi received neither a win nor a loss. The right-hander allowed one run and five hits in six innings, striking out three and walking none.He\'s got a fine 3.73 ERA and has allowed two runs or fewer 20 times this year, but owns an unspectacular 9-6 record.""Over time we\'re going to win a lot of those ball games,"" manager Kevin Cash said.Odorizzi can\'t do anything about it but shrug his shoulders, grab the ball every fifth day and hope for the best.""I honestly don\'t think about it,"" he said. ""I try to keep us close every time. Not lose us the game. As long as that doesn\'t happen, it\'s a quality outing. It\'s a funky thing but no-decisions are a lot better than losses, the last time I checked.""Mark Trumbo hit his major league-leading 43rd homer to break an eighth-inning tie and provide Baltimore with a much-needed win.Manny Machado also connected for the Orioles, who lead the majors with 236 home runs. Baltimore salvaged a split of the four-game series against the last-place Rays and improved to 16-47 when scoring three runs or fewer.""We needed two runs to win today because we pitched real well,"" manager Buck Showalter said, ""and we got them.""After missing two straight games with back spasms, Trumbo returned with a flourish. With one out in the eighth, the Orioles\' cleanup hitter drove the first pitch from Ryan Garton (1-1) far over the center-field wall, his career-high 101st RBI of the season.""This time of year, someone\'s got to step up at some point in the game,"" Trumbo said. ""It was a well-played game, but we just needed to get that hit there at the end. So it was nice.""Brad Brach (10-3) pitched the eighth and Zach Britton got three outs for his 45th save in 45 tries. After Tampa Bay got a runner to second with one out against Britton, the lefty struck out pinch-hitter Logan Forsythe and retired Alexei Ramirez on a grounder to shortstop.Corey Dickerson homered for the Rays, extending the team\'s streak of games with a long ball to 14. The drive put Tampa Bay ahead 1-0 in the fifth inning.Odorizzi left with the score 1-all. He\'s 6-1 since July 10.""Can\'t be happier with the way Jake battled today,"" Cash said.Orioles starter Wade Miley allowed one single over four shutout innings, then left with a mild muscle strain in his upper back after warming up in the fifth.That put an end to perhaps his best performance since joining Baltimore on July 31. The left-hander was 1-5 with an 8.41 ERA in eight starts as an Oriole.Miley was replaced by Darren O\'Day, who was activated from the disabled list before the game. The sidearmer\'s first pitch since Aug. 11 was hit by Dickerson into the left-field seats.Tampa Bay loaded the bases with one out in the sixth against Donnie Hart before Dickerson hit into a double play.Machado led off the bottom half with his career-high 36th home run and fourth in 32 career at-bats against Odorizzi.IT\'S A STEALRays CF Kevin Kiermaier stole his 18th consecutive base in the fourth inning. He\'s 20 of 22. The Orioles have 17 steals as a team, on 28 attempts.TRAINER\'S ROOMRays: 1B Nick Franklin (hamstring) hasn\'t played since Thursday and is ""still pretty sore,"" according to Cash. ... C Bobby Wilson left the team because of a death in the family.Orioles: To make room for O\'Day (shoulder), 1B Steve Pearce (forearm) was moved to the 60-day DL, ending his season.UP NEXTRays: Tampa Bay is off Monday.

The time is now for the Baltimore Orioles, whose hopes to win the American League East hinge on their four-game series against the first-place Boston Red Sox beginning Monday at Camden Yards. Baltimore took two of three at Boston last week but only managed to split its four-game set against last-place Tampa Bay and sits three games behind the Red Sox with 13 remaining. The Orioles, who hold a one-game edge over Toronto for the top wild-card spot, used the long ball to edge the Rays 2-1 on Sunday as Manny Machado went deep in the sixth inning to forge a tie before Mark Trumbo launched his major league-leading 43rd of the season two frames later to snap the tie. Boston took out its frustrations of losing back-to-back contests against Baltimore by sweeping a four-game set with the New York Yankees over the weekend. Hanley Ramirez had quite the series, going 9-for-16 with four home runs and nine RBIs while opening and closing the set with game-winning blasts. The Red Sox still have a chance to finish with the most wins in the AL, as they trail Texas (88) by only three with Cleveland in between (86). PITCHING MATCHUP: Red Sox RH Rick Porcello (20-4, 3.12 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Dylan Bundy (9-5, 3.88) Porcello looks to avenge a rare loss after he had his six-game winning streak snapped by the Orioles on Wednesday despite allowing just one run and four hits over eight innings. The 27-year-old native of New Jersey has suffered three of his four defeats this season on the road but has won three straight decisions away from home. Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s setback dropped Porcello\xe2\x80\x99s career record against Baltimore to 3-8 in 14 starts but lowered his ERA versus the division rival to 5.19. Bundy will be making his 13th consecutive start after beginning the season with 22 appearances out of the bullpen. The 23-year-old from Oklahoma has won six of his last eight decisions, with four of the victories coming against division leaders. One was recorded at Boston on Tuesday, when Bundy evened his record at 1-1 in six career games (two starts) versus the Red Sox despite giving up three runs on six hits and four walks in 5 1/3 innings. WALK-OFFS 1. Red Sox DH David Ortiz was rested on Sunday but is expected to be in the lineup against Baltimore. 2. Trumbo has hit safely in eight of his last nine contests and 14 of 16 this month. 3. The season series has been tight thus far, with Baltimore holding a slight 8-7 edge.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('The only thing worse than keeping Matt Wieters would be ...', ' The question of what the Orioles should do with Matt Wieters has been hanging over their heads going back to last year. Wieters accepting the qualifying offer for the 2016 season has only put off those discussions for a year and now they\xe2\x80\x99re coming back again.    Last anything crept into the public rumor sphere about Wieters was exactly one month ago when Jon Heyman reported that the Orioles were not planning to make another qualifying offer to Wieters. Not a particularly shocking revelation to anyone who has spent significant amounts of time in 2016 watching Wieters. So that\xe2\x80\x99s settled, right? Maybe not so fast. Back on Friday, Baltimore Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s Dan Connolly wrote that Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 agent, Scott Boras, will be in town in Baltimore starting today in order to discuss a number of things with Dan Duquette or Peter Angelos, including a possible contract extension for Wieters, about which Boras told Connolly that he believes there\xe2\x80\x99s mutual interest between team and player. One might imagine that Boras is not coming out to Baltimore to discuss maybe adding just one more year onto the contract. They\xe2\x80\x99d probably be taking multiple years for a lot of millions of dollars. Mustering excitement for several more years of Wieters when he is currently hitting .241/.301/.398 - the worst batting year of his career - is a bit of a difficult proposition.    It\xe2\x80\x99d be unfair to say that Wieters has not been worth anything at all this year, nor would it be fair to say he will have no value in the future. The question is whether his salary demand would be in line with, or at all close to, the value he\xe2\x80\x99s likely to produce going forward.    A 2016 season where he\xe2\x80\x99s getting the $15.8 million qualifying offer salary and worth either 1.0 or 1.3 WAR, depending on which site you consult, is not inspiring in this regard. You would have to be really sure that Wieters is going to be better than what he\xe2\x80\x99s shown this year to confidently offer him a contract. It\xe2\x80\x99s now been four years since he played a full season where he posted an OBP over .300. To be sure, the Orioles have a whole lot more information about what Wieters is right now and what he may be in the future than I do. That\xe2\x80\x99s true in nearly every scenario about any player, though of late the Orioles have made use of their extra information to do things like sign Yovani Gallardo and trade for Wade Miley, either one of which any of us could have told them was a bad idea just from looking at Fangraphs.     They were bad ideas and they\xe2\x80\x99ve worked out badly. My reaction to the idea of a Wieters extension is no different now than it was last year. It seems at first glance like another bad idea that would work out badly. The 2016 season certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done a whole heck of a lot to change anyone\xe2\x80\x99s mind for the better about that. Which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Boras from saying things like this in Connolly\xe2\x80\x99s article linked above: \xe2\x80\x9cThis guy is General Grant and General Lee. He is the North and the South. He can do it all,\xe2\x80\x9d Boras told BaltimoreBaseball.com. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is all-around.\xe2\x80\x9d    It\xe2\x80\x99s an amusing turn of phrase that would hold a lot more water if Wieters was not in the middle of his worst offensive season as well as seeming to have really lost something of his defensive ability. If you want to look at pitch framing - a concept that\xe2\x80\x99s as frustrating as it is unavoidable - Wieters ranks towards the bottom, as he has always done. The number of wild pitches that go by him has soared.  Not every wild pitch is a catcher\xe2\x80\x99s fault, but my eyebrow raises when I see the same guy had 28 wild pitches go past him in 1,201 innings in 2013 and now has had 40 wild pitches allowed in just 881.1 innings caught this year. It gives me pause. Is that something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to come back? I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be betting on it. There is one area where Wieters has stayed strong on defense, though, and that is in controlling the running game. Wieters has thrown out 34% of the 58 runners who\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to steal on him. That\xe2\x80\x99s compared to a league average of 29%. That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good, and even better if you throw out the runners who probably stole on Ubaldo Jimenez rather than Wieters.  In Jimenez appearances, Wieters only threw out one of 15 would-be base-stealers. That means that Wieters has thrown out 44% of runners when Jimenez isn\xe2\x80\x99t pitching. That\xe2\x80\x99s better than just pretty good.    The stolen base thing is even more important if you, like me, find yourself eyeing top Orioles prospect, catcher Chance Sisco, and his .320/.406/.422 batting line at age 21 at Double-A Bowie and imagining him replacing Wieters in the near future.  Sisco may yet do so, but beware that runners took off on him a whopping 136 times in 754.1 innings and he only threw out 33 - a 24% success rate. The bat might be ready, but the rest could probably use some Triple-A time. Thinking of Sisco as the Opening Day 2017 catcher seems overly ambitious. Combine that fact with the dire status of the list of pending free agent catchers from MLB Trade Rumors and the equally dire performance of the non-Wieters catchers on the 2016 O\xe2\x80\x99s team, and maybe the prospect of Wieters hanging around beyond this season doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like such a bad idea after all.  The Orioles can\xe2\x80\x99t just go into the offseason saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just get by with Caleb Joseph and Francisco Pena for a few months.\xe2\x80\x9d It is not a plan for success. The Orioles front office surely knows it. If Boras is demanding some ridiculous price tag like five years and $100 million, of course Duquette should laugh and end the talks. What\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable number? Would Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 side want to do something like three years at $15 million per year?     It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine they\xe2\x80\x99d want to talk less than three years, or that the Orioles would want to talk more than three. Once Sisco does arrive, even if he splits playing time with Wieters initially, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like Wieters has ever hit well enough to set him up as a part-time designated hitter. The money itself is less of a concern than I would have thought a year ago. At least, as long as last offseason\xe2\x80\x99s spending really signals a new era of Orioles payroll budgets. If Wieters sucks up $15 million or even a little more, so what? That won\xe2\x80\x99t stop them from doing other things, especially not this offseason, where there\xe2\x80\x99s hardly anybody worth signing anyway. All in all, keeping Wieters around a while longer may well be a bad idea, but letting him go could be an even worse one. If the two sides can work out a fair deal, that should be something to celebrate. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99ll even happen this week when Boras is in town.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The American League East race is gaining more definition this week, and the Boston Red Sox are emerging as the clear favorites. The Red Sox will try to add to their division lead and trim their magic number to eight when they visit the Baltimore Orioles for the second of a four-game series on Tuesday. Boston knocked the New York Yankees out of the race with a four-game sweep over the weekend and set about doing the same to the Orioles with a 5-2 victory in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s series opener. Mookie Betts continued his domination of Baltimore with a two-run blast and David Ortiz homered as well for the Red Sox, who are now four games ahead of the Orioles with 12 left in the regular season. Baltimore had a chance to get back into the division race with a strong series but ensured that it will be in no better than second place when the weekend rolls around with a loss in the opener, leaving the wild card race a more pressing concern. The Orioles remain in a battle with the Toronto Blue Jays for the top wild card spot, with the Detroit Tigers and the Seattle Mariners lurking close behind. PITCHING MATCHUP: Red Sox LH Eduardo Rodriguez (2-7, 4.98 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Kevin Gausman (8-10, 3.43) A potential third spot in the Boston postseason rotation behind Rick Porcello and David Price is up for grabs, and Rodriguez did not do much to distinguish himself last time out. The 23-year-old Venezuelan could not make it through three innings and was ripped for four runs on eight hits by the New York Yankees on Thursday. Rodriguez tossed four hitless innings at Baltimore on Aug. 16 before leaving with tightness in his hamstring and is 1-3 with a 4.30 ERA in six career starts against the Orioles. Gausman had no trouble with the powerful Red Sox offense on Wednesday, when he scattered four hits over eight scoreless innings to outduel Porcello in a 1-0 Baltimore win. Gausman is 5-0 in his last six starts and held the opposition scoreless in four of his past five outings. The LSU product has not served up a home run in any of his last five starts and is 3-3 with a 4.01 ERA in 13 career games \xe2\x80\x93 eight starts \xe2\x80\x93 against Boston. WALK-OFFS 1. Betts is batting .500 with eight home runs and 15 RBIs in seven games at Baltimore this season. 2. Orioles OF/1B Steve Pearce, who was placed on the 60-day disabled list, will have surgery on Wednesday to repair flexor tendons in his right arm. 3. Boston 1B Hanley Ramirez, who was named AL Co-Player of the Week on Monday, is 10-for-20 with four home runs and nine RBIs in the last five games.

We get it. Every publication has written a story. Every upset uncle has typed a Facebook rant. We heard you. Loud and clear.     Last night, the Orioles lost 5-2 to the Red Sox in a pretty important game at home. They did so in front of 18,456 fans; a good chunk of which were supporting the visitors. Oriole Park holds about 45,000 people. So, that was disappointing in many ways. And to hear chants of \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go Red Sox!\xe2\x80\x9d at several points in the game was enough to make any Birds fan a little miffed.  Of course, I observed all of this from the comfort of my couch. So, believe me, I\xe2\x80\x99m not pointing fingers. We\xe2\x80\x99re just talking here. Ya know, like friends.  The stats I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at BaseballReference.com for all of this information. According to BR, prior to last night\xe2\x80\x99s game, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a total attendance this season of 1,976,194, which is an average of 26,705 per game. Both of those numbers sit them in 20th place of Major League Baseball, the lowest standing of any \xe2\x80\x9ccontending\xe2\x80\x9d team.    At this point last season, the Birds had drawn 2,165,296 in attendance. That is an average of 29,261 per game. If I\xe2\x80\x99m doing the math right (I\xe2\x80\x99m probably not), that is about a nine percent decrease from a year ago.     On paper, that makes no sense. The 2016 version of the Orioles already has more wins than 2015\xe2\x80\x99s team did and there are still two weeks to go. So, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t people heading to the park? More numbers Well, if we keep looking at numbers, we see that attendance is down across the league. There have been 566,649 fewer people at baseball games this summer when compared to last. Of course, across every game that number is a negligible 253 people each night.    Breaking it down team-by-team though, 18 of the 30 MLB teams have seen fewer fans at the park this year, including the defending World Series champion Royals, NL East-leading Nationals, Wild Card-contending Tigers and the consistently fantastic Cardinals. The O\xe2\x80\x99s aren\xe2\x80\x99t alone in playing good baseball, but failing to draw fans. On top of that, the Orioles have really good television ratings. I know. I know. That is a very common, very lame, and yet quite logical, reason. Forbes had them as the fourth-best local market in the country just after the All-Star break, and I doubt it has changed much since then. Baltimore still cares. It just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t translated to the turnstiles...or, ya know, those little scanner things. What\xe2\x80\x99s up? I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure of the cause. You tell me. We can hypothesize all we want. Steve Cockey did a really nice summary of many reasons for BaltimoreBaseball.com a couple of weeks ago. And, in reality, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t just one reason alone. It\xe2\x80\x99s all of them.    If we want to focus on just one game, like last night\xe2\x80\x99s duel with the Red Sox, it seems like there are a lot of easy answers: it was a weeknight, the kids are back in school, no giveaway, poor weather, prime game which means more expensive tickets, the TV product is so great, yada, yada, yada. It becomes a tad harder to put together reasons for the entire season. To me, the two big ones have to be the cost of going to the games and this summer\xe2\x80\x99s weather. It was unrelentingly hot in Maryland and the O\xe2\x80\x99s bumped up the cost of tickets this season. But with the team\xe2\x80\x99s relatively good play on the field, those seem like pretty minor reasons to keep away nearly a tenth of the game-going fanbase. One final reason Honestly, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you why exactly more people aren\xe2\x80\x99t attending ballgames. But here is my best guess at another factor: they just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to. Why? They expect a better product on the field, as greedy as that may seem. There are a lot of good things about the Orioles. They hit dongs. Manny Machado is one of the best in the game. Adam Jones is the greatest centerfielder in franchise history. Kevin Gausman is turning a corner. And Zach Britton is putting together one of the most incredible seasons by a reliever EVER. But is this a great team that you can reasonably see winning the World Series without a LOT of things working out that probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t?  Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong. They could certainly do it. But this is a club with a lot of holes. The outfield defense can be real bad. The starting pitching, while competent lately, has been abhorrent for long stretches. And the offense seems to randomly fall asleep if they don\xe2\x80\x99t hit a home run.    Maybe Baltimore fans are just THAT fair-weathered. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want \xe2\x80\x9ccompetitive\xe2\x80\x9d anymore, they want outright winners. The dark, 14-year-long cloud is gone and a distant memory for some. This organization has been a \xe2\x80\x9cwinner\xe2\x80\x9d for five years now and has recently been to an ALCS. The next step is the World Series, not simply getting to the crapshoot that is the Wild Card game. The fans pay attention. The decision to basically stand pat this winter, save for a Yovani Gallardo/Wei-Yin Chen swap and a buy-low Mark Trumbo trade, raised some eyebrows. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the O\xe2\x80\x99s won\xe2\x80\x99t dip their toe too far into free agency. But it is also widely known that the minor league cupboard is relatively barren. You can see how a fanbase gets discourage despite recent success. Of course, I do think that fans should be getting out to the games to support the Orioles in force. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not my money to spend. If the O\xe2\x80\x99s can hold on and make it to the playoffs, Camden Yards will be stuffed. If they prove me wrong and make a World Series run, it could stay that way come next regular season. Maybe I am totally off base with all of this. It seems like a topic that stirs a ton of conversation, so go for it. Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t more people going to Orioles games? Let us what you think in the comments down below, on Twitter and on Facebook.     ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('The Orioles trading for Steve Pearce is even worse than we ...', ' When a team acquires a player at the trade deadline in order to bolster the team for the playoff chase and the playoffs themselves, and that player lands on the 60-day disabled list in mid-September, it\'s safe to say that trade didn\'t quite work out. That\'s where the Orioles stand with Steve Pearce, who will be getting season-ending surgery to repair flexor tendons in his right arm.    Pearce, whom the Orioles acquired from the Rays in exchange for catching prospect Jonah Heim, was batting .309/.388/.520 at the trade deadline, and he seemed to be a player who might be able to fill a role the Orioles needed: A bat actually capable of hitting left-handed pitching. It was a nice idea in theory, and, Pearce being an ex-Oriole who had been a key contributor on the 2014 division-winning team, it was a feel-good story for them to get him back. The trade hadn\'t quite worked out even without the injury, since Pearce only batted .217/.329/.400 in 25 games with the O\'s, but it was something where you could at least understand the rationale. Except it\'s not quite that easy. Ever since the injury was first aggravated with the O\'s after the trade, you could peer at Pearce\'s season stats and wonder why he never played even one inning of outfield with the Rays. Sure, they have better outfielders than the Orioles do, but with as well as he was hitting, you\'d think they\'d squeeze him in wherever they could.    What if Pearce had been hurt all along? This seemed crazy to think about, the Orioles reputation for the physical being what it is - though of course there\'s no taking a fresh physical for a trade, just reviewing of medical information. The Orioles wouldn\'t actually trade for a player they knew to be injured, would they?    The Baltimore Sun\'s Eduardo Encina\xc2\xa0answered the question in an article on Monday night:  Orioles executive vice president Dan Duquette said the club was well aware of physical limitations Pearce had when the returned to Baltimore in a trade with the Tampa Bay Rays. ""We reviewed the medical and we know Steve Pearce, we had him,"" Duquette said. ""Unfortunately, he had an injury with us that made things considerably worse than when he came. We had a good idea [of his health], but having said that, we expected that he would finish the season and help us in the playoffs.""     This is the kind of stuff that, when you add it to the pile of other bad Duquette moves, really can drive you crazy. The Orioles genuinely knew there were physical limitations to Pearce and still decided to make the trade, knowing that they intended to try to use him as a corner outfielder? Encina adds later in the article that Pearce specifically did not play outfield in Tampa due to the issue with his arm, and further, that Pearce stopped playing second base after May 31 due to the same issue. They seem to have never wanted him to actually have to make a hard throw. And then here comes the Orioles, throwing him into left field almost immediately and aggravating that injury almost immediately. The Pearce trade has quite suddenly gone from a bad luck trade made for a good reason to an absolutely infuriatingly short-sighted trade made out of desperation. No desperation Orioles trade has worked out in the Duquette era and with the kinds of moves he makes when he gets really stuck, I won\'t be holding my breath waiting for the first.    The Orioles definitely did need a player to hit lefties. Preferably, they would get a real outfielder in the process, which Pearce certainly isn\'t, but a lefty-masher would have been fine. Their outfield defense could hardly get worse by putting Pearce out there. There has been a season-long need for another player like that in the lineup. They might even need more than one. The Orioles are the single worst American League team by OPS when it comes to hitting lefties, with a .233/.301/.390 batting line. That\'s why they got Pearce. It wasn\'t a bad idea, except for when you take the injury thing into consideration. Why would they make that trade at all if they had awareness of Pearce\'s limitations? That\'s ridiculous! It\'s not like this is some wild conspiracy theory. Duquette openly conceded the reality to an Orioles reporter. The Duquette-bashing crowd will surely add this to fuel their ever-burning bonfire of hatred for the O\'s GM. One can defend a lot of what Duquette does, even some of the moves that don\'t work out, but there\'s nothing to say in defense of a move made that didn\'t work out due to an injury that the Orioles apparently knew about before the trade. That\'s the Orioles talking themselves into a bad idea that they really should have known better than to make happen. Now the only real question with the trade is how much Heim makes them regret it into the future. Perhaps not much. Although Heim had a very strong defensive reputation in the O\'s system, things hadn\'t yet clicked so well for him when it came to hitting. The 21-year-old Heim batted .216/.300/.344 in 88 games with High-A Frederick before the trade.    That\'s not looking like a guy who\'s going to be causing Orioles fans grief as he succeeds for another MLB team the very next year, such as Zach Davies with Milwaukee or Steven Brault with Pittsburgh. Heim is going to have to improve to even get himself up to the level of expectations for hitting for an MLB backup. Maybe he never will. But the Orioles would have been better off keeping him rather than crossing their fingers to re-acquire Pearce. The short-sightedness of the trade is simply astounding. Duquette has done many good things while in charge of the Orioles - see how they\'re in the postseason hunt for the third time in five seasons since he took over, and they haven\'t had a losing season yet - but his trades to try to improve the team in the middle of a season really leave something to be desired. Knowing what\'s now known, the Orioles took a chance in trading for Pearce that they never should have taken. The Pearce move is no longer defensible in any way. They didn\'t get what they convinced themselves they\'d get out of him, and now they\'re out a possible backup catcher of the future. Stop making stupid win-now trades that don\'t even help the Orioles win now!  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Toronto is in second place, four games back following a 10-2 victory at Seattle.After sweeping four games from the Yankees, the Red Sox have won the first two of this pivotal four-game series by identical scores.""Two runs is not quite enough to go up against that offense,"" Orioles catcher Matt Wieters said. ""We know we need to do better and score more runs.""Facing the highest-scoring team in the majors, Baltimore got only six hits against Eduardo Rodriguez (3-7) and four relievers.""They\'re pitching real well and we haven\'t swung the bats real well,"" manager Buck Showalter said.Trey Mancini homered in his major league debut for the Orioles, who are 1 1/2 games ahead of Detroit for the second AL wild card.The Red Sox are 11-3 in their last 14 games and a major league-best 13-5 in September.""I think there is growing confidence in our clubhouse daily,"" manager John Farrell said.The Red Sox led 2-1 in the seventh when Marco Hernandez and Mookie Betts singled off Kevin Gausman (8-11). One out later, Ortiz hit a 1-2 pitch far over the center-field wall.""I still can\'t figure out how he can swing so hard on balls up and in and then cover a pitch down and away, but that\'s why he\'s the hitter he is,"" Wieters said.Ortiz guessed correctly that Gausman would throw a fastball.""I had to shoot for something. Experience played out in that at-bat,"" he said. ""I told myself, \'I\'ve got to either shoot for a fastball or a splitter.\' But I know he\'s throwing his best fastball right now. So I\'m going to go for a fastball.""Playing in his final season, Ortiz has 36 home runs and 121 RBIs. Big Papi has hit eight home runs against the Orioles this season \xe2\x80\x94 including two in this series \xe2\x80\x94 and 54 for his career.Betts also extended his run of success against Baltimore, going 3 for 5 and scoring twice. He is 16 for 31 at Camden Yards and has scored 16 runs in eight games.Rodriguez allowed two runs and four hits in 6 1/3 innings to earn his first win in 11 starts since July 16.Craig Kimbrel worked the ninth for his 28th save.After giving up four hits in eight scoreless innings last week at Boston, Gausman yielded five runs and 10 hits in 6 1/3 innings.""I was just leaving a couple of pitches too good early on,"" he said. ""A team like this, it\'s tough to repeat what I did in Boston.""Boston went up 1-0 in the third when Betts singled and scored on a grounder by Hanley Ramirez. Jackie Bradley Jr. hit his 26th homer in the fourth.Rodriguez retired his first 11 batters and held Baltimore without a hit until Mancini connected with two outs in the fifth. The rookie sprinted around the bases, taking about half the time Ortiz did during his home run trot in the seventh.UNFORGETTTABLE MOMENTThe Orioles were quick to turn the page after the defeat, but Mancini will never forget this night. He became the third Orioles player to homer in his first game, following Larry Haney in 1966 and Jonathan Schoop in 2013.""It was a really special moment, something that I\'ve definitely been waiting for my whole life,"" the rookie said.TRAINER\'S ROOMRed Sox: Farrell gave 2B Dustin Pedroia (knee) the night off but expected him back in the lineup Wednesday.Orioles: LHP Wade Miley is expected to leave the team after Sunday\'s game against Arizona to join his wife, who is expecting.

The O\xe2\x80\x99s fell 5-1 to the BoSox.The Baltimore Orioles have all but rolled over and played dead against Boston this week. Last night they were plugging along with a 1-0 lead until the sixth inning, when Boston seemingly took control of the game. So in looking at the title of this morning\xe2\x80\x99s article, I pose an interesting question about playing\xc2\xa0not-to-lose\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6which is a game that\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly played in European soccer quite often. In round robin tournaments often times if both teams are advancing alreay the two coaches will wink at each other and and their teams will play fairly vanilla. What\xe2\x80\x99s the point of trying to go all out and win when all you have to do is not lose? It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit different in a sport like baseball \xe2\x80\x93 there are no ties.The fact is that you can\xe2\x80\x99t play\xc2\xa0not-to-lose in American sports the way one can in Europe. However it seems that the Orioles have had losing on their minds this week. By that, I mean that they\xe2\x80\x99ve played so tight because they\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of making a mistake and losing. They know how fine a line it is to toe in MLB \xe2\x80\x93 between winning and losing. But take it from me\xe2\x80\xa6both in baseball and in life, if you\xe2\x80\x99re so afraid to lose that all you do is play it safe, your worst fears will come true.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley The Baltimore WireCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireUbaldo Jimenez pitched fairly well last night, as has been his trend.. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.1 IP, 4 H, 2 R (0 earned), 4 BB, 8 K. I use this term often, but he put the Orioles in a position to win the game. They just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of that. And the Orioles actually had the lead in this game at 1-0, on Adam Jones sac fly-RBI in the third.However the Orioles went 0-for-3 with RISP, which is why I question if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t playing not-to-lose. Let me be clear; I\xe2\x80\x99m\xc2\xa0NOT questioning the effort in any shake of the imagination. I recognize how hard it is to win a major league game, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the fact that the Orioles are going to finish with a winning record once again is such an impressive feat. But I also suspect that they thought they could win this game 1-0 past a certain point. And against a team like Boston, that\xe2\x80\x99s a dangerous thought.Chris Davis committed a two-run error in the sixth which immediately gave Boston the lead for good. Again, the pressure to win can sometimes cause mistakes to happen. Andrew Benintendi also smacked a three-run homer later in the inning, and that\xe2\x80\x99s your ballgame.

The Arizona Diamondbacks may have the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 number during their rare interleague meetings, but right-hander Yovani Gallardo routinely has gotten the better of the desert dwellers throughout his career. Gallardo looks to improve upon his 7-2 mark and 2.32 ERA in 12 career starts on Friday when he takes the mound in the opener of a three-game series at Camden Yards. Paul Goldschmidt has gone deep three times in the last two games, including a pair of homers in Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s 3-2 win over San Diego on Wednesday. The 29-year-old is an impressive 6-for-10 with five walks versus Gallardo while two of his three hits against Baltimore have left the yard. The Orioles were unceremoniously swept in a four-game series by Boston that concluded on Thursday and have seen their offense go limp with just 12 runs in a 1-5 stretch. Former Diamondback Mark Trumbo is 1-for-12 with four strikeouts in his last three games for Baltimore, which finds itself a half-game behind Detroit in the race for the second wild card in the American League. PITCHING MATCHUP: Diamondbacks RH Shelby Miller (2-12, 6.90 ERA) vs. Orioles RH Yovani Gallardo (5-8, 5.77) Miller fell to 0-6 in his last seven starts on Saturday after allowing four runs on seven hits in 5 1/3 innings of a 6-2 setback versus the Los Angeles Dodgers. The tough outing actually reduced his ERA, but the 25-year-old would rather celebrate after recording his first win since June 20. Pedro Alvarez is 5-for-20 with three homers off Miller, but the veteran right-hander has retired Trumbo in all six plate appearances. Gallardo fell to 2-7 in his last 11 starts on Thursday after getting shredded for six runs on seven hits in 3 1/3 innings in a 7-6 setback to Tampa Bay. The 30-year-old has surrendered 19 runs and five homers in his last four starts and has been taken deep 10 times in his last 11. Gallardo needs to keep an eye on Welington Castillo, who is just 1-for-9 in his last four outings but is batting .316 versus the hurler. WALK-OFFS 1. Orioles CF Adam Jones is 1-for-11 in his last three games overall and 0-for-14 in three career outings versus the Diamondbacks. 2.

Be it in April or September, when you\xe2\x80\x99re at home and you go into extra innings, you always have a shot to win on one swing of the bat. In this case, it\xe2\x80\x99s September \xe2\x80\x93 and the Orioles are fighting for their playoff lives.The Birds got a decent outing out of Yovani Gallardo, who checked in with a quality start. He also put his team in a position to win, although he didn\xe2\x80\x99t ge the run support he probably deserved. Gallardo\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.0 IP, 6 H, 2 R, 2 BB, 5 K. However keep in mind that at this stage of the game it\xe2\x80\x99s not about run support or anything else \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s about winning.Arizona got an RBI-single from Jake Lamb in the first, and an RBI-double from Jean Segura in the second to take a 2-0 lead. That Lamb RBI-single was fairly consistent with something that\xe2\x80\x99s plaqued the Orioles for years. It was a dying quail that was seemingly barely nicked at the plate.

Hardy tried to score from first on Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 single. However he was called out at home plate. The Orioles challenged under the collision rule, but it was ruled inconclusive.And on we played. The Birds had the bases loaded in the 11th but were unable to plate a run, and it was starting to look like this could turn into a marathon-type game. However in games like this you always give the nod to the home team because of their last at-bat.

But also because it\xe2\x80\x99s tough for me to separate my own personal thoughts and beliefs and to keep journalistic integrity when it comes to matters involving the flag or the national anthem.But I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a shot at it here, as the Orioles prepare to continue their hunt for October. As you might have gathered from above, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a fan of anyone disrespecting our flag or anthem under any circumstances. To me there are just some things that are more sacred than anything else \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s one of them.However there\xe2\x80\x99s little doubt that Mr. Kaepernick and others are within their rights to do it. Furthermore, I might even support the root of their cause in trying to stand for social justice. Heck, I suspect that the majority of the good and honest police officers (which is the vast majority of officers on forces nationwide) do as well. The last thing they want are a couple of bad apples giving them all bad names.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley The Baltimore WireCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireBut in effect that message is lost on folks such as myself, as all we see is our nation\xe2\x80\x99s flag being disrespected by people using the very laws that the flag represents to do so. However that aside, it\xe2\x80\x99s not something we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in MLB as of yet. Although it\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s been addressed, very specifically by Adam Jones. While Jones said that he intended to stand for the anthem, he supported Kaepernick\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0right to sit or kneelIn truth, he has no choice \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s a right guaranteed to Kaepernick by the constitution. And in fact, if you want to see a country where \xe2\x80\x9cpatriotism\xe2\x80\x9d is forced, look no further than North Korea. However the more controversial aspect of Jones\xe2\x80\x99 comments were that nobody in baseball has followed suit because \xe2\x80\x9cbaseball is a white man\xe2\x80\x99s sport.\xe2\x80\x9d He received some backlash for those comments, but to his credit he attacked them head-on. And if his remarks were ever a story, that story has now passed.Interestingly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this \xe2\x80\x9cphenomenon\xe2\x80\x9d spread to other NFL sidelines, and even to other sports. And again, my point would be that there\xe2\x80\x99s a better way of protesting very legitimate causes than by disrespecting our nation overall. Last night the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints opted to join hands at midfield during the anthem in a show of unity for the cause of social justice. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the type of thing that gets the point across without disrespecting the flag or the country as a whole.However now I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to hear stories about high school teams pulling stunts like laying on the ground during the anthem, among other things. So\xe2\x80\xa6is there ever a point where this will run it\xe2\x80\x99s course? Are players/people doing this simply because it\xe2\x80\x99s fashionable at this point, or because they want to prove a point? Because at this point, I question whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s still news when someone pulls this stunt.More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerAnd there are some folks out there who will say\xc2\xa0what do you expect people to do to get society\xe2\x80\x99s attention\xc2\xa0and so forth. Colin Kaepernick did get everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and did create a national discussion. But in defending Kaepernick\xe2\x80\x99s right to do what he did, even President Obama said that it might have been best to leave the flag or the anthem out of the protestation \xe2\x80\x93 since people had died for that over the years. However again, I\xe2\x80\x99m\xc2\xa0NOT in anyway saying that Mr. Kaepernick doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the right to do what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing. He totally does \xe2\x80\x93 I just wish he did it in another way.And again, before people say that he wanted to do something that would kind of shock society, keep in mind that Martin Luther King (the greatest civil rights leader in history in my view) accomplished a lot more by marching from Selma and speaking at the Lincoln Memorial for the March on Washington. And mind you, all of his marches somehow included the American flag.Next: Baltimore Orioles restore order in the universe - for nowAre we now having the national debate that Kaepernick wanted? Yes I suppose we are. Mind you, police brutality and race relations are a problem in America, and there can be no question about that. But I feel that we should look to the example of Dr. King to fix those issues as opposed to the image of a multi-millionaire sitting on the bench during the national anthem.

The Toronto Blue Jays are still alive in the race for the American League East crown, though just barely. The Blue Jays will try to keep their chances alive and knock the Baltimore Orioles further back in the wild card race when they host the second of a three-game series on Wednesday. The Boston Red Sox had a chance to clinch the AL East crown with a win or a Toronto loss on Tuesday but neither event occurred, leaving the Blue Jays five games back in the East with five left in the regular season. The wild card race is the bigger focus as Toronto moved two games ahead of the Orioles for the top spot and, more importantly, remained three games clear of the third-place Detroit Tigers and four in front of the Seattle Mariners with a 5-1 triumph in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s series opener. Baltimore is just one game north of the Tigers and will play its final five regular-season games on the road, where it is 35-41. The Orioles would like to avoid coming back to Toronto for the wild card game and are 2-6 in eight games at the Blue Jays in 2016. PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Chris Tillman (16-6, 3.84 ERA) vs. Blue Jays LH Francisco Liriano (8-13, 4.88) Tillman is trying to bounce back from a terrible outing against Boston on Thursday, when he was reached for three runs on five hits and three walks in just 1 2/3 innings. The California native is in line to start for Baltimore in a potential wild card game and is making his fourth start since August 20 after missing three weeks with bursitis in his right shoulder. Tillman allowed two runs in 5 2/3 innings at Toronto on July 31 and is 5-10 with a 5.61 ERA in 23 career starts against the Blue Jays. Liriano is no stranger to pitching in big games after helping the Pittsburgh Pirates to the playoffs the last three years and is 2-2 with a 3.35 ERA in nine appearances \xe2\x80\x93 seven starts \xe2\x80\x93 since joining Toronto. The Dominican Republic native is coming off his best performance since returning to the AL, holding the New York Yankees scoreless on three hits in six innings to earn a win on Friday. Liriano has not seen Baltimore since joining the team and is 2-0 with a 2.60 ERA in his last three home starts. WALK-OFFS 1. Blue Jays RHP Joaquin Benoit suffered a torn left calf during a benches-clearing incident against New York on Monday and is likely to miss the rest of the season. 2. Baltimore 2B Jonathan Schoop is 0-for-20 with six strikeouts in the last five games. 3. Toronto 2B Devon Travis (left shoulder) aggravated an injury in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s brawl and is day-to-day.

The Baltimore Orioles stayed alive in the battle for the top American League wild card spot and put themselves in position to pull even with the Toronto Blue Jays atop the standings with a dramatic victory on Wednesday. The Orioles can earn that tie and keep some space between themselves and the rest of the AL wild card contenders when they visit the Blue Jays in the rubber match of the three-game series on Thursday. Toronto was on the verge of a three-game lead in the standings before the bullpen had a little trouble closing out a two-run lead on Wednesday, and the recent struggles of Jason Grilli and Robert Osuna in the late innings are a concern. Grilli has allowed five runs while recording three outs in his last two appearances while Osuna was hit with a blown save in two of his last three games. Hyun Soo Kim\xe2\x80\x99s pinch-hit, two-run blast off Osuna in the ninth on Wednesday was the deciding factor in the win and left Baltimore one game ahead of the Detroit Tigers and two clear of the Seattle Mariners in the race for the second wild card. The Orioles finish the regular season with three games at the New York Yankees over the weekend while the Blue Jays travel to Boston. TV: 7:07 p.m. ET, MASN (Baltimore), Sportsnet (Toronto) PITCHING MATCHUP: Orioles RH Ubaldo Jimenez (7-12, 5.71 ERA) vs. Blue Jays RH Marcus Stroman (9-9, 4.34) Jimenez has been solid since returning to the rotation late in August and posted quality starts in four of his last six turns. The Dominican Republic native went at least six frames in the first five of those outings but lasted only 5 1/3 innings against Boston in his last start on Sept. 21 and was hit with the loss while allowing two unearned runs on four hits and four walks. Jimenez limited Toronto to three runs in 6 2/3 innings without factoring in the decision on Aug. 30. Stroman has not won since Aug. 14 despite allowing three or fewer earned runs in six of his last seven turns. The best start of the bunch came against the New York Yankees on Saturday, when the Duke product surrendered one hit in seven innings but was held out of the decision in a game the Blue Jays went on to win 3-0. Stroman last saw Baltimore on June 19 and was lit up for seven runs and 10 hits in 3 2/3 innings. WALK-OFFS 1. Blue Jays 2B Devon Travis (shoulder) sat out the last two games. 2. Baltimore LHP Zach Britton turned in his 13th straight scoreless appearance for his 47th save on Wednesday. 3. Toronto CF Ezequiel Carrera is 9-for-18 with six runs scored in his last five starts.

09/30/2016,"[('Baseball - Orioles down Blue Jays to bolster playoff pursuit', ""TORONTO, CANADA - SEPTEMBER 29: Ubaldo Jimenez #31 of the Baltimore Orioles delivers a pitch in the first inning during MLB game action against the Toronto Blue Jays on September 29, 2016 at Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images/AFPTORONTO, CANADA - SEPTEMBER 29: Ubaldo Jimenez #31 of the Baltimore Orioles delivers a pitch in the first inning during MLB game action against the Toronto Blue Jays on September 29, 2016 at Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images/AFP (AFP Photo/Tom Szczerbowski)More- Ubaldo Jimenez allowed one hit in 6 2/3 scoreless innings Thursday as the Baltimore Orioles beat the Blue Jays 4-0 to tie Toronto for the first American League wild card berth. The Orioles took the rubber match of the three-game series in Toronto after the Blue Jays took the opener. The St. Louis Cardinals kept their bid for a National League wild card berth going by rallying for a 4-3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Yadier Molina's two-out run-batted-in double in the bottom of the ninth inning. The Cardinals pulled within two games of the idle New York Mets for the National League's first wild-card spot and within a half-game of San Francisco for the second wild card spot.AFP "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Ubaldo Jimenez pitches Birds closer to ...', ""Ubaldo Jimenez pitched six plus innings of one-hit baseball as the Baltimore Orioles tied Toronto for the top wild card spot.As maligned as Ubaldo Jimenez has been by Baltimore Orioles fans over time, you have to admit that he normally shows up when he\xe2\x80\x99s needed most. I would point back to the 2014 AL East clincher against Toronto, where Jimenez started out of the bullpen and came up big for the Birds. He\xe2\x80\x99s also had several big starts over the past couple of weeks, which brought him and the Orioles to last night\xe2\x80\xa6,,,ironically against Toronto once again. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.2 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 3 BB, 5 K. Anytime a pitcher goes as long as Jimenez went into that game and tosses a one-hitter, he\xe2\x80\x99s really on his game. Jimenez certainly struggled for much of the 2016 season. However he\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99d call a big-game late-season pitcher. He steps it up when he needs to.Some fans might justifiably point out that perhaps had Jimenez been on his game earlier the Orioles might not still be trying to wrap up a playoff spot at this point. But the point is that when he\xe2\x80\x99s called in a big spot late in the year, Jimenez has proven that he shows up. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a good guy to have on your team.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman's return was a welcomed one in Baltimore The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Injury update on Orioles starting pitcher Wade Miley The Baltimore WireCurt Schilling Continues to be an Embarrassment Call to the PenBaltimore Orioles: Chris Tillman season debut scheduled for Sunday Call to the PenFantasy Baseball 2017: Zach Britton back on 10-day DL Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBaltimore Orioles Acquire Jordan Kipper from Angels The Baltimore WireThe Orioles took a 1-0 lead in the third on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI. Michael Bourn grounded into a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice-RBI an inning later, and the Birds led 2-0. RBI-singles by Kim and Wieters in the seventh and eighth innings closed out the scoring, and the Birds took a 4-0 victory into the clubhouse.WIth the win, the Orioles are now tied with Toronto in the American League Wild Card standings. Whichever team finishes with the better win percentage will host the wild card game, which is scheduled for next Tuesday night. If the two teams finish tied, Toronto wins the tie-breaker. Toronto finishes their season in Boston, while the Orioles of course are down the pike in New York.Notice that I said the wild card game is\xc2\xa0scheduled\xc2\xa0for Tuesday. In theory that could be up in the air if tie-breakers come into play. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 magic number to clinch a playoff spot is three. However Detroit (who\xe2\x80\x99s chasing the Birds) was rained out yesterday at home in their game against Cleveland. That game would in theory be made up on Monday\xc2\xa0if it\xe2\x80\x99s needed.If the Orioles can eliminate Detroit before then, that game will be irrelevant. However if Detroit is still within a half-game of overtaking or tying the Orioles, it would need to be made up. And that\xe2\x80\x99s where it gets murky; if that game is made up on Monday and after the fact the Orioles (or Toronto for that matter) and Detroit are tied, then what happens? In that case they\xe2\x80\x99d have to play a tie-breaker game, which in reality would be\xc2\xa0regular season game 163.More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal2/17 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Johnson wants to revitalize his careerSo when does that happen? Obviously MLB has a nightmare scenario in that situation, because they\xe2\x80\x99d probably need to reshuffle the schedule a bit. However my prediction is that it won\xe2\x80\x99t be an issue. While Detroit is playing Atlanta this weekend, any combination of Orioles (or Toronto) wins and Detroit losses which equal three eliminates Detroit. So if the Birds take two-of-three in NYC and Detroit drops at least one game in Atlanta, that\xe2\x80\x99s the end of it.Obviously if the Orioles sweep the series in NY it would be over as well. So at this point I\xe2\x80\x99m predicting the Orioles as a playoff team, but without the theatrics which a lot of folks are saying could happen. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to look at it; if the Orioles and Atlanta win tonight, then an Oriole or an Atlanta win tomorrow will put the Orioles in the playoffs.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Hyun-Soo Kim saved his best for lastThe aforementioned penultimate series in New York begins tonight at Yankee Stadium. Yovani Gallardo gets the ball for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by New York\xe2\x80\x99s Michael Pineda.

Three singers then stood on the first-base dugout and did a rendition of \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land Is Your Land,\xe2\x80\x9d the famous folk song written by Woody Guthrie.By the time the end of the third verse arrived \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cAll around me a voice was sounding, this land was made for you and me\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 fans had joined in.In a tradition that dates to the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror attacks in 2001, \xe2\x80\x9cGod Bless America\xe2\x80\x9d is played in major league ballparks around the country, including in Baltimore, during the seventh-inning stretch of Sunday games. The song can also be heard during assorted holiday games, and the Yankees play the song during the seventh inning of every home game.But Baltimore is the only major league franchise to regularly play \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land Is Your Land,\xe2\x80\x9d which it does at Friday home games. And the song, long considered an anthem of the left because of its populist themes, is meant to be more than a Camden Yards singalong. It is a subtle, yet intentional, message from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 management that at the intersection of sports and patriotism, one size does not have to fit all.

But, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a strain of progressivism in American life, and if we can reflect it, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles began occasionally playing Guthrie\xe2\x80\x99s song in the 2015 season. This year, they made it a staple on Fridays, which means it was in place before San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick focused attention on a nationwide debate when he declined to stand for the national anthem before an N.F.L. exhibition game in August.Kaepernick cited racial oppression as the reason for his action, which paved the way for symbolic gestures by other athletes, some who have knelt during the anthem, others who have linked arms while standing at attention and still others who have raised a clenched fist.Set against all this is Guthrie\xe2\x80\x99s song, which the Orioles, who finish the season at Yankee Stadium, will have a chance to play again this year only if the team makes it to the playoffs. Regardless, they plan to keep playing \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land\xe2\x80\x9d next season. In the meantime, Angelos is keeping a close eye on all the ripple effects created by Kaepernick. Photo       Woody Guthrie, above, who was known for his songs about the downtrodden, wrote \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land Is Your Land\xe2\x80\x9d in 1940 as an answer to Irving Berlin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGod Bless America.\xe2\x80\x9d  Credit             Associated Press           \xe2\x80\x9cI hope people in the sports industry are learning from what Colin Kaepernick is doing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope we can learn that speaking out about your country is not un-American, that words like \xe2\x80\x98un-American\xe2\x80\x99 have no place.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  As for the criticism Kaepernick has faced, Angelos called it \xe2\x80\x9cdisgusting.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt reeks of McCarthyism,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The history of Guthrie\xe2\x80\x99s tune is linked to \xe2\x80\x9cGod Bless America,\xe2\x80\x9d which was written by Irving Berlin and then recorded by Kate Smith in 1938, when it became a hit at a time of uneasiness in the years leading up to World War II.Guthrie, who had spent years traveling the country during the Great Depression, had Communist sympathies and a different, more defiant, vision of the United States than the one conveyed in \xe2\x80\x9cGod Bless America.\xe2\x80\x9d As an answer to that song, he wrote \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land Is Your Land\xe2\x80\x9d in 1940.His original lyrics questioned the merits of private property and included lines that were never officially recorded: \xe2\x80\x9cBy the relief office, I saw my people. As they stood there hungry, I stood there wondering if this land was made for you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d Through the years, the song was popularized by Guthrie\xe2\x80\x99s son, Arlo, and others, including Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen.

Privacy Policy    John Shaw, the author of \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land That I Love,\xe2\x80\x9d a book about the two songs, said the two songwriters had more in common than meets the eye. Although \xe2\x80\x9cGod Bless America\xe2\x80\x9d has become associated with unvarnished patriotism, that was not Berlin\xe2\x80\x99s intent. When the song was written, Shaw said, it was Berlin\xe2\x80\x99s way of showing gratitude that he was no longer in Europe. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a love letter written by an immigrant to his adopted country,\xe2\x80\x9d Shaw said.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  As for Guthrie, Shaw noted that while the original lyrics were a sarcastic response to Berlin\xe2\x80\x99s song, \xe2\x80\x9cThis Land Is Your Land\xe2\x80\x9d evolved, too. \xe2\x80\x9cIt became a love song to America, too,\xe2\x80\x9d Shaw said.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, major league teams began playing Berlin\xe2\x80\x99s song as a show of patriotism. But Angelos also thought about how the Orioles could diversify the way they honored America. For instance, the team now has a program to honor community heroes at Friday, Saturday and Sunday home games. Photo       John Angelos, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 chief operating officer, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a strain of progressivism in American life, and if we can reflect it, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Credit             Todd Olszewski/Orioles           The core of the idea was to celebrate various citizens, and not just members of the military, and pair each day with a different song (\xe2\x80\x9cAmerica the Beautiful\xe2\x80\x9d is played on Saturdays). Last Friday, the community hero was a bus driver, Reneita Smith, who saved a group of elementary students from a burning school bus.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cPeople forget a lot of these stadiums are publicly funded buildings and, by law, they have to welcome people from all different walks of life,\xe2\x80\x9d Angelos said. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes sports can be narrowcast in the causes and groups focused on. Our idea is that everyone should be included; let\xe2\x80\x99s not leave anyone out.\xe2\x80\x9dThat the Orioles are taking this approach is not all that surprising. Peter Angelos made his fortune representing workers in asbestos cases. He refused to sign replacement players during the strike by players in 1994 and 1995, and he helped arrange for the Orioles to play a home-and-home series with the Cuban national team in 1999 at a time when there was no active relationship between the countries.

Jones, who recently said that athlete protests over the national anthem had not spread to baseball because of a lack of racial diversity in the sport, said he was not conversant with the song\xe2\x80\x99s political history.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Several fans, asked about the song\xe2\x80\x99s meaning last week, also pleaded ignorance. \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt most of our guys know who Woody Guthrie is,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Buck Showalter added.  For his part, John Angelos said it did not bother him that many fans and players may not know the song\xe2\x80\x99s origins because it was only one aspect of the community heroes program.\xe2\x80\x9cWe can honor a veteran, but we can also honor a veteran who is against a particular war,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat diversity is what the song represents.\xe2\x80\x9d  A version of this article appears in print on October 1, 2016, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: In Baltimore, This Song Is Their Song.

The televisions in the middle of the room were showing the final inning of the Toronto Blue Jays\xe2\x80\x99 game in Boston. The Jays were down to their last out.\xe2\x80\x9cStrike him out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schoop, who had just driven in five runs against the Yankees. But his heart was not really in it. He left the room before the Red Sox obliged, lifting the Orioles into the top spot in the American League wild-card race. The Orioles have reason to be confident; if they keep winning, they will need no help to host a game at Camden Yards next week.With a soggy 8-1 victory over the Yankees in the Bronx \xe2\x80\x94 and the Blue Jays\xe2\x80\x99 5-3 loss at Fenway Park \xe2\x80\x94 the Orioles now stand a game ahead of the Blue Jays. They nearly fell three back on Wednesday, before a ninth-inning, pinch-hit homer by Hyun Soo Kim in Toronto.\xe2\x80\x9cI thought we were going to win that game, frankly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan Duquette, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 executive vice president for baseball operations. \xe2\x80\x9cI really did, because we\xe2\x80\x99d played a good game. We played good defense, we got good pitching. We still had a shot. And that was a terrific at-bat by Kim.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Now the Orioles have won six of their last seven. At 88-72, they can clinch one of the wild-card spots with a victory on Saturday and a loss by the Detroit Tigers. That would be a tidier outcome than a slew of other possibilities.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  If Toronto pulls even with the Orioles at the end of the regular season, the Blue Jays will host the wild-card game on Tuesday because they won the teams\xe2\x80\x99 season series. But if Detroit is just a half-game ahead or behind after Sunday, the Tigers will have to make up a rained-out game against Cleveland on Monday. That could set up a three-way tie for two spots.Other possible outcomes are in play, too. The Seattle Mariners are still alive, and the Tigers, conceivably, could play five games in five cities from Sunday through Thursday. It is a lot to process.

There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of different things that will cloud your mind if you let them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles are striving for another shot at their first championship since 1983. They lead the A.L. in victories and home runs \xe2\x80\x94 while committing the fewest errors \xe2\x80\x94 since the start of the 2012 season. But they have not advanced past the A.L. Championship Series. The Kansas City Royals swept them in that round two years ago.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cIf you get in the tournament, who knows, right?\xe2\x80\x9d Duquette said. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of the teams that get into the tournament as a wild card, they do pretty well. Just got to win a couple more games and get into the tournament and take our chances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles have gotten this far with extremes: They lead the majors in home runs, and have stolen the fewest bases. They have by far the most home runs, with 250, but have just 19 stolen bases and six triples, which would be the fewest ever by a team in a season.Yet the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 power and bullpen \xe2\x80\x94 anchored by the incomparable Zach Britton \xe2\x80\x94 have been enough to overcome the lack of speed, and a rotation with a 4.74 E.R.A. Every team with a higher starters\xe2\x80\x99 E.R.A. has a losing record. The Orioles have found a way, but this was not part of some master plan.\xe2\x80\x9cWe just try to get the best players we can get,\xe2\x80\x9d Duquette said. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes the value\xe2\x80\x99s in the relief pitchers. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s in the power hitters. We\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to develop some good starters, which we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress on. So we\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to get the best players we can for the value, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on power, without power arms in their rotation, could be a dubious formula for October success. Mark Trumbo, the major league leader in home runs, sounded almost apologetic Friday when asked about the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 three-homer fifth inning, which included his 47th of the season.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s kind of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve proven we do,\xe2\x80\x9d Trumbo said. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially going into the situation we\xe2\x80\x99re in, I like the execution just as much, though. From here on out, beyond the regular season, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see pitching that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be top of the line, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important against guys of that caliber to be able to scrap together some runs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  As soon as Saturday, the Orioles could clinch their opportunity. Showalter likes what he sees.\xe2\x80\x9cOur guys, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to have a real peace about the endgame here, because they\xe2\x80\x99ve given themselves every chance,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say this about every team I\xe2\x80\x99ve had, but this team will be as good as it\xe2\x80\x99s capable of being \xe2\x80\x94 I feel like, anyway. They\xe2\x80\x99re a real trustworthy bunch.\xe2\x80\x9d  A version of this article appears in print on October 1, 2016, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Orioles  Set Off, Destination Unknown.

It was first given by Major League Baseball in 2014. The American League\xe2\x80\x99s honor is named for Mariano Rivera, the National League\xe2\x80\x99s for Trevor Hoffman. Rivera, Hoffman and other decorated former closers do the voting.\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not that highly touted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zach Britton, the star closer for the Baltimore Orioles. \xe2\x80\x9cRarely do you even know who wins it. The Cy Young\xe2\x80\x99s always been the pinnacle of the pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s award. Coming up, I thought it was the starting pitcher award. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know relievers had won it, just because there\xe2\x80\x99s been very few that have.\xe2\x80\x9dRelievers are eligible, and nine have won since baseball writers created the award in 1956. Usually, though, it goes to an ace starter who exhibits durability and dominance, like Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Max Scherzer, the clear choice in the N.L. this season.Scherzer was 19-7 with a 2.82 earned run average. He pitched like an ace more than anyone else, with a major-league-best 18 starts in which he lasted at least seven innings and allowed no more than two earned runs. His 0.940 walks plus hits per inning is the best in the league, as is his strikeout total, 277. Opponents managed a meager .248 on-base percentage against Scherzer. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      In the A.L., there has been no similar starter. Nobody had an E.R.A. below 3.00. Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Rick Porcello (22-4, 3.15) leads the league in walks plus hits per inning and strikeout-to-walk ratio, but Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s Corey Kluber, the Chicago White Sox\xe2\x80\x99 Chris Sale and Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s Justin Verlander were dominant more often.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Britton, meanwhile, has simply done his job better than any other pitcher in the A.L., going 47 for 47 in save opportunities. His 0.55 earned run average would be the lowest in baseball history for a pitcher who had thrown at least 65 innings.Britton has faced about 250 batters. Kluber, Porcello, Sale and Verlander have each faced more than three times that. But Britton\xe2\x80\x99s success in high-leverage situations has made him the league pitching leader in Win Probability Added, which measures how much a player affects the outcome of games.\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s all relative to nowadays, how the game is,\xe2\x80\x9d Britton said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe game is really built on big bullpens; we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that with world champions. It\xe2\x80\x99s not built on rotations as much as it was. So I think, sometimes, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get people\xe2\x80\x99s heads to grasp that the game has evolved. People find that if you have a dominant bullpen, to an extent those guys affect more games than a good starter will, which is at most 30 or 35 games.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Britton came up as a starter but found his calling in the bullpen as a one-pitch marvel, with precision command of a heavy, darting sinker. He works many more games now, for shorter, intense bursts.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be only 60 to 70 innings, but it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to ask somebody to be perfect over time,\xe2\x80\x9d Britton said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a starter, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have that pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Britton has achieved perfection, in a season when no A.L. starter has overwhelmed the field. No reliever has won the Cy Young Award since Eric Gagne, who was perfect in save chances for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2003.

Most Valuable PlayerMike Trout, Los Angeles AngelsMany voters link this award to team success, yet this guideline is detailed on every ballot: The M.V.P. need not come from a division winner or other playoff qualifier.

He did everything exceptionally well, and even brought stolen bases back to his game.Who is more valuable than Trout? Do not hold the Angels\xe2\x80\x99 threadbare roster or serious pitching injuries against him. The answer is that no player is more valuable. Yes, the Angels had a losing record with Trout. Without him, they would have been much worse. Whether his value helped his team win 90 games or 70 should not matter.

But Trout entered the weekend first in the A.L. in on-base percentage and second in slugging percentage. Betts ranked eighth in both. We should not overthink this. Nobody is better than Trout.Runners-up: 2) Mookie Betts, Boston; 3) Jose Altuve, Houston; 4) Josh Donaldson, Toronto; 5) David Ortiz, Boston; 6) Adrian Beltre, Texas; 7) Manny Machado, Baltimore; 8) Miguel Cabrera, Detroit; 9) Robinson Cano, Seattle; 10) Mark Trumbo, Baltimore.

He needed just six and one-third innings to qualify for the E.R.A. title. On a rainy night in Detroit, he fell three innings short.Even so, coming that close to the E.R.A. title ought to earn Fulmer the A.L. Rookie of the Year Award. Fulmer, who went to the Tigers from the Mets for Yoenis Cespedes last summer, made 26 starts. In 21 of them, he allowed three runs or fewer. He should be rewarded for consistent quality from late April through late September.

He never had to make the adjustments all players must face over the long season, so even to be runner-up is an achievement. Ryan Dull \xe2\x80\x94 the Oakland setup man who had held opponents to five hits in 68 at-bats with runners in scoring position through Thursday \xe2\x80\x94 also makes the ballot.

Manager of the YearTerry Francona, Cleveland IndiansTerry Francona won two championships with Boston but never received this award until he guided the low-payroll Indians to a wild-card berth in 2013. This season, he led Cleveland to its first American League Central crown in nine years, easily winning a division that included the reigning World Series champions (Kansas City) and a team loaded with stars (Detroit).The Indians\xe2\x80\x99 best hitter, Michael Brantley, played only 11 games. The team got almost no production from its catchers, and a vaunted rotation hobbled to the finish. But Francona put his players in position to succeed, and he was not scared to use his best reliever, Andrew Miller, to snuff out rallies before the ninth inning.

Most Valuable PlayerKris Bryant, Chicago CubsKris Bryant is poised to follow up his rookie-of-the-year season with a runaway victory for M.V.P. He would become the fourth player to win those awards in consecutive seasons, after Cal Ripken Jr., Ryan Howard and Dustin Pedroia. (Fred Lynn and Ichiro Suzuki won them in the same season.)  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Bryant brings significant value with his bat; he hits for average, gets on base a lot and is one of the majors\xe2\x80\x99 top sluggers. But he gets extra credit for starting at four positions, personifying the value of versatility in today\xe2\x80\x99s game.It was tempting to endorse Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s Nolan Arenado, an exceptional defender at third base who strikes out a lot less often than Bryant does. But Arenado got a serious boost from playing at Coors Field, where he had a 1.032 on-base-plus-slugging percentage entering the weekend, compared with .832 on the road. Still, he ranks just behind Bryant and Daniel Murphy among N.L. stars this season.

Corey Seager, a 22-year-old Dodger, showed that he might be the premier N.L. shortstop for years to come. Just three other rookies in the last 40 years have hit .300 with at least 70 extra-base hits: Nomar Garciaparra (1997), Albert Pujols (2001) and Jose Abreu (2014). All unanimously won rookie of the year, and Seager will do so, too.

The Cardinals\xe2\x80\x99 Aledmys Diaz, the Rockies\xe2\x80\x99 Trevor Story and the Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 Trea Turner each have a strong case for the final spot, but Diaz gets the edge because he played the most games.

It was a go.Within seconds, a crew of maintenance workers descended on the visiting clubhouse with rolls of plastic wrap, tape and staple guns, feverishly erecting a protective wrapper around the roughly 900-square-foot room.But out on the field, the Yankees began a wild comeback in the bottom of the ninth inning, which Cucuzza watched carefully. If the Yankees won \xe2\x80\x94 as they did \xe2\x80\x94 and if the Baltimore Orioles lost to the Toronto Blue Jays, the Red Sox would not clinch the American League East title. Cucuzza and the maintenance crew would have had to tear down the work they had just completed in only a few minutes, before the losing players returned to the clubhouse.\xe2\x80\x9cI had my phone, and I was also watching the score in Toronto,\xe2\x80\x9d Cucuzza said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was close, but when I saw the Orioles scored in the ninth, I just said to leave it all up.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      When the Orioles won on Wednesday, the Red Sox clinched the division and were able to celebrate. Now it could be the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 turn, leaving Cucuzza and his crew to arrange and clean up a second celebration.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles, who lost to the Yankees, 7-3, on Saturday, could clinch a wild-card berth on Sunday, which would result in Yankee Stadium having hosted two Champagne-and-beer celebrations in less than a week, neither involving the Yankees themselves. Times have certainly changed.\xe2\x80\x9cIf you win, you\xe2\x80\x99ve earned that right,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Girardi, the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 manager, said with a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to celebrate, then don\xe2\x80\x99t let them beat you.\xe2\x80\x9dClubhouse celebrations have been a tradition in baseball dating at least to the 1950s. But with the advent of divisional play, and then of three divisions and two wild-card teams in recent years, the Champagne-infused fiestas have mushroomed.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  There are now five playoff teams in each league, so 10 teams can celebrate their entrance into the postseason. With each round of the playoffs (two wild-card games, two division series, two league championships and one World Series) factored in, baseball can have a total of 17 \xe2\x80\x9cChampagne fights,\xe2\x80\x9d as Japanese reporters like to call them.

Privacy Policy    The unsung heroes of all these celebrations are the clubhouse attendants, like Cucuzza, who are charged with preparing for and cleaning up long after the last drop of Champagne has been poured over the last man on the roster.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cWe finished cleaning up around 3:30 in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d Cucuzza said of Wednesday night\xe2\x80\x99s celebrations, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s faster than it used to be. But the kids did a tremendous job. The Red Sox players came in the next day and said they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it did not even smell.\xe2\x80\x9dThat was in part because of a celebration innovation that could become as common as protective eyewear. Like a sharp baseball scout, Cucuzza was watching the Chicago Cubs celebrate their division championship on television last month when he noticed plastic wrapping on the floor of the Cubs\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse, not just over the lockers.\xe2\x80\x9cI thought, \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s an idea,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Cucuzza said.So he and his staff did the same thing for the Red Sox\xe2\x80\x99 celebration Wednesday. When the party was over, Cucuzza and five members of his clubhouse staff gathered around sections of the plastic and lifted up the corners, creating a kiddie pool of the remnants of Champagne and beer. They carried it into a hamper and out to be drained. The process was repeated for the remaining sections of floor covering.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  When they were done, a cleaning crew shampooed the rug. In years past, when all the Champagne and beer spilled directly onto the carpet, the cleaning crew would have to come in two or three times to extract the liquid and shampoo the rug, and the smell would linger for days.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Red Sox celebrated their division title on Wednesday despite having lost on a game-ending grand slam by Mark Teixeira. If the Orioles had lost to the Blue Jays, Cucuzza and his staff would have quickly removed the carts full of Champagne and beer, as well as all that plastic. There would not have been time, however, to put all the furniture back in place.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tradition,\xe2\x80\x9d Red Sox Manager John Farrell said the day after the party. \xe2\x80\x9cLast night was surreal. It was odd. Do you celebrate after a loss? That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a fundamental question.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles knew on Saturday that they could face similar circumstances on Sunday. If the Tigers lose on Sunday, and the Seattle Mariners were also to lose one of their last two games, then the Orioles could clinch even if they lose to the Yankees on Sunday.Buck Showalter, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 manager, has refused even to discuss any advance scouting for the playoffs, let alone the idea of celebrating after a loss.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are trying to do something that makes us that team,\xe2\x80\x9d he said before Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s loss.But if the Orioles do end up partying at Yankee Stadium on Sunday, Cucuzza and his staff will be there to clean it up.
