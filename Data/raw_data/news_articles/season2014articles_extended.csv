Mandatory Credit: David Manning-USA TODAY SportsThe first televised Baltimore Orioles spring training game revealed more than just hopes for seasonal change, but also hopes for a successful 2014 for the Birds. Fans got to see both the friendly faces of the past, along with a new set of personnel who hope to contribute to the coming season. (For a complete reference list, check out our article HERE. It can help you out in the latter innings of the game!)One is never completely certain what can be learned from a spring training game. The visiting team does not always bring their main guys, though the Blue Jays did bring more than is typical. And pitchers may be working on a specific part of their game such as spotting their fastball.\xc2\xa0But it turned into an interesting game as the afternoon wore on.It was the host of back-up players for the Orioles who put up seven runs in the bottom of the 8th inning to bring the Birds back from a 7-2 deficit to score a 9-7 victory. The big blow was provided by Francisco Peguero who cleared the loaded bases with a two-out triple. Oh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t recall Peguero? Can he make the team? That\xe2\x80\x99s why you need the list mentioned above!Starting pitcher Miguel Gonzalez looked very good. Though he gave up a run on two hits in the second inning, both hits were on pretty good pitches \xe2\x80\x93 gotta give the hitters credit sometimes.We were able to see from David Lough some of the elements of his game that are destined to make him a fan favorite in Baltimore. He made a nice diving catch on a liner into short left-centerfield. And he beat out an infield grounder by his hustle down the line, setting up scoring the first Orioles run on a Chris Davis two-run double. Lough worked a leadoff walk in the fifth and stole second base.Ryan Webb, a player I hope could be considered perhaps a top choice as a closer candidate, did not look good at all. His ball was up in the zone and he did not work at all to hold base runners. He did manage to get out of his inning with no runs scored on three hits.Edgmer Escalona gave up a 2-1 Orioles lead in the top of the 6th inning, though he probably deserved a bit better fate.\xc2\xa0 Xavier Paul turned a fly ball into a double, and a broken bat single extended the inning. Dan Johnson would get a pitch down the center of the plate and drive a three-run homer over the right-field fence. After five runs scored, it does not look good for Escalona\xe2\x80\x99s chances.Catcher Johnny Monell had a terrible game in every facet. He struck out twice, had runners taking bases, and failed to pull down a high throw from Schoop at the plate.Jonathon Schoop continues to impress, driving a bases-loaded two-run grounder into left field in the eighth inning. Though there is quite a sizeable fan club out there to see Schoop make the team now, and in spite of his early successes in spring training, I do not think he looked at all close to being ready last year or in the Arizona League. He\xe2\x80\x99ll get there though.But the main thing today is that they are playing actual baseball games! The next televised game will be Friday against the Phillies.How about starting your year off on the right foot as well by liking The Baltimore Wire on Facebook and following @BaltimoreWireFS on Twitter? ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Blue Jays @ Orioles spring training home opener, 1:05 ...', "" The Orioles are undefeated after one game in the Grapefruit League, so you might as well start printing out those playoff tickets now. I hope you're a season ticket holder so you get priority in buying them.    Today's home opening spring training game will feel a whole lot more like an Orioles game because most of the players will be actual people who are likely to make the roster. Yesterday's win with that little hodge-podge gang was nice enough, but a game that starts out with probably 8/9 of the Opening Day lineup - all except for the recovering Manny Machado - is much more, well, Orioles. Though, for all the excitement there's been about the newer, buffer Nick Markakis, I can't imagine he's buff enough to bat fifth in the regular season. Sure, they'll probably only get like one at-bat and then get lifted for the parade of camp filler, but for three-ish glorious innings, there will be real Orioles baseball. The game will be televised even once it turns into a field full of nobodies, which is also fun. You can tune in on MASN, or once again on WBAL radio.

Toronto Blue JaysJose Reyes, Maicer Izturis, Munenori KawasakiJose Reyes is a four-time All-Star and is considered one of the best shortstops in the game.\xc2\xa0 A career .292 hitter, Reyes has all tools.\xc2\xa0 He is a good hitter for average, with power numbers typical for a shortstop.\xc2\xa0 Although not the greatest fielder as far as fielding percentage, Reyes has great range.\xc2\xa0 His 2013 season was diminished due to injuries, playing in only 93 games.\xc2\xa0 A solid contributor all around, Reyes takes the top billing at the position.Izturis appears he will be the Jays utilityman at this point, with Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 killer Munenori Kawasaki likely being sent to Triple-A.\xc2\xa0 Kawasaki saw most of his playing time last year when Reyes was hurt, and the Jays will be counting on a healthy Jose Reyes in 2014.2. Baltimore OriolesJ.J. Hardy, Alexi Casilla, Ryan Flaherty, Alex GonzalezJ.J. Hardy takes the second spot in the AL East shortstop rankings.\xc2\xa0 J.J. is one of the top power hitting shortstops in the game, averaging 26 homers a season while an Orioles. \xc2\xa0His average is atypically low for a shortstop, a .256 hitter during his three year tenure as an O.\xc2\xa0 However, the Orioles will gladly take the power numbers and the great fielding that comes from Hardy.\xc2\xa0 Hardy has been a Gold Glover each of the last two seasons, has great range and does not commit many errors.Casilla and Flaherty are both battling for the second base position, one that certainly heated up the first week of camp (I\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on that in another post).\xc2\xa0 Flaherty will likely make the team, so if he is not the starting second basemen, he likely will be the utilityman. Gonzalez also could make the team, but it would like mean the O\xe2\x80\x99s break camp with several injuries, something the team hopes to avoid.New York Yankees3. Derek Jeter, Brendan Ryan, Eduardo NunezThis is a hard ranking.\xc2\xa0 Despite being an Orioles fan, I have the utmost respect for what Derek Jeter has accomplished on the baseball field.\xc2\xa0 However, 13-time All-Star Mr. November is now 39 years old, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have much playing time left on his body. He has already announced he will retire at the end of the season. So what Jeter will we see during his final year?\xc2\xa0 Will it be the man who played in 159 games in 2012, and led the majors in hits, hit 15 home runs, had a .316 batting average and was an All-Star and Silver Slugger?\xc2\xa0 Or will be the player\xe2\x80\x99s whose body started breaking down in 2013, playing only 17 games and hitting .190.\xc2\xa0 I think all baseball fans want Jeter to have a successful season, but to expect the numbers from 2012 would be absurd.\xc2\xa0 If he can stay healthy, Jeter will be a solid contributor to the Yankees.\xc2\xa0 But like so many of the players in the Yankee infield (Brian Roberts, Mark Teixeira) that is a big if.Ryan and his sterling defense will be the backup, although both he and Nunez could see a lot of time at other positions depending on injuries and performance.\xc2\xa0 Another thing to watch for is that Jeter makes a lot of starts at DH, and these two split time at shortstop.4. Tampa Bay RaysYunel Escobar, Ben Zobrist, Jayson Nix, Logan ForsytheYunel Escobar was once a top prospect with the Atlanta Braves, before being traded to the Blue Jays, who then shipped him to the Marlins in exchange for Jose Reyes in that blockbuster deal.\xc2\xa0 The Marlins flipped him to the Rays, where he started 149 games as the everyday shortstop in 2013.\xc2\xa0 Escobar is never going to hit home runs, but his average is never going to be high either.\xc2\xa0 However, the Rays are more than willing to live with that, as he fits the theme of their offense.\xc2\xa0 Get on base and make things happen.\xc2\xa0 With a .350 on-base percentage for his career, Escobar has a propensity to do just that.\xc2\xa0 In addition, 2013 was arguably his best season with the glove as well.\xc2\xa0 Escobar is a solid player, and the Rays will take that every day from their shortstop.Zobrist of course will be playing all over the field, and former Yankee Jayson Nix also was invited to Spring Training.\xc2\xa0 Forsythe is listed on the depth charts as the utilityman, but you have to think with Zobrist able to fill that role and star in it, that Escobar may not have a true backup.5. Boston Red SoxXander Bogaerts, Jonathan HerreraIf you were upset that I have Jeter ranked third, you might be appalled that Xander Bogaerts is ranked last out of the five AL East shortstops.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest, I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to watch the kid play. The 21-year-old from Aruba played in 18 regular season games in 2013, hitting .250 and being a defensive whiz.\xc2\xa0 He had much better numbers in the postseason, playing in 12 games, including all six of the World Series games, where he showed just how much potential he has.\xc2\xa0 But the questions remain about how good of a hitter Bogaerts can be?\xc2\xa0 His defense is stellar, but in a division with Jose Reyes, J.J. Hardy, Derek Jeter/Brendan Ryan and Yunel Escobar, everyone else knows how to field their position too.\xc2\xa0 The expectations are through the roof.\xc2\xa0 He is classified as a complete player, a natural hitter and a guy who has some pop in his bat.\xc2\xa0 But at 21, in his first full major league season, is he ready to handle the position?\xc2\xa0 The Red Sox hope so, because as you can see, they have only possible utilityman Herrera backing him up.Come June, these rankings could be vastly different.\xc2\xa0 Bogaerts might quickly rise to the top, while Jeter struggles to stay healthy.\xc2\xa0 This position is arguably the deepest in the division, and makes for interesting debate.\xc2\xa0 How do you think they should be ranked?

(AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Masahiro Tanaka was happy with his performance in a brief appearance for the New York Yankees in a spring training game on Friday, with every pitch from the big-money signing heavily scrutinized by the team, the media and expectant fans alike.Tanaka enters the upcoming season with enormous expectations after signing a $155 million, seven-year contract, and having gone 24-0 in his last season in Japan, so Friday\'s initial mound appearance against Philadelphia was the subject of intense focus.He pitched two scoreless innings, striking out three batters and giving up a pair of singles.""I felt pretty good out there,"" Tanaka said through an interpreter. ""I was nervous, but it was a really good nervousness. I\'m relieved to be able to throw against the batters over here.""Tanaka came into the game after C.C. Sabathia and Hiroki Kuroda each pitched two innings. Some fans in the announced crowd of 10,934 at Steinbrenner Field stood when Tanaka went to the mound to a loud ovation.""A buzz around the park,"" Sabathia said.Tanaka was in control the whole way.""The biggest thing was he looked calm out there,"" Kuroda said of his countryman through an interpreter. ""And the command was there, so he was good.""Darin Ruf, the first batter Tanaka faced, swung and missed at Tanaka\'s first two pitches before lining a single to center. After getting a pair of flyballs, Tanaka struck out a swinging Cesar Hernandez.In the sixth, Tanaka fanned a swinging Ben Revere on an impressive splitter before Ronny Cedeno blooped a single. All-Star Domonic Brown went down swinging and pinch-hitter Kelly Dugan flied out.The fans again cheered for Tanaka as he departed, en route to be greeted by his new teammates, who lined the top step in the dugout to offer congratulations.""I was encouraged by what I saw, how he handled it,"" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ""People were eager to see him pitch. The guys on our team were eager to see him pitch.""Tanaka is expected to make his first regular-season start in New York\'s third or fourth gameThe Yankees said Saturday\'s game was carried by three TV networks in Japan.Tanaka, however, doubted that family or friends watched it live back home, where it was early in the morning.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInGrapefruit League photos from spring training\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

03/02/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The spirit of the Fighting Showalters', 'If the 2014 Baltimore Orioles go onto have a season to remember, few people will point back to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s 9-7 spring training victory over Toronto and say that it was the launching point. Let me rephrase that;\xc2\xa0NOBODY\xc2\xa0will point back to yesterday. However all good teams have to have the element of a comeback in them at various points in the season, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something we saw yesterday. The O\xe2\x80\x99s trailed 7-2 going to the last of the eighth, and when all was said and done they put seven runs on the board that inning to take a 9-7 lead (which stood up as the final).We should bear in mind that the guys who orchestrated the comeback are hardly the lovable group that we saw turn into the Fighting Showalters in the latter part of 2011 and throughout 2012. For the most part, the guys who orchestrated the comeback are just hoping for a spot on the big league roster \xe2\x80\x93 anyone\xe2\x80\x99s big league roster at that. But perhaps they channeled the spirit of the Fighting Showalters, and brought it forward into today as part of their quest for work in professional baseball. Needless to say, it was a welcome sight for Orioles fans.\xc2\xa0Courtesy of David Manning-USA TODAY SportsMiguel Gonzalez got the start for the O\xe2\x80\x99s yesterday, and as he admitted later in the game on MASN, threw primarily fastballs. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 2 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 0 BB, 0 K. The lone run Gonzalez allowed came on an RBI-single which followed two stolen bases. It was certainly not a bad outing for Gonzalez, however I think most fans would have liked to have seen him mix up his pitches a bit. But that\xe2\x80\x99s an element to these spring games (especially early) in that often times managers will pick one pitch for their pitchers to work on. The most impressive part of the day in my view was David Lough in left field and leading off. Lough had an impressive play in the field, and reached base by legging out an infield hit. Lough struck out to open the last of the first, but worked the count full on nine pitches. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the type of at-bats you want out of your leadoff guy.Following the aforementioned infield hit, Nelson Cruz drew a walk and both Cruz and Lough crossed home plate on Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x98 two-RBI double (Davis took third on the throw home). Steve Johnson also bounced back nicely from a rocky appearance in an intrasquad game last week by retiring all six batters he faced.The game seemed to spiral out of control for the Orioles in the fifth when reliever\xc2\xa0Edgmer Escalona gave up five runs, the last three of which came on a Dan Johnson home run. For awhile, it appeared that the saving grace of the day would be that the Orioles were leading when most of the regulars left the game. (Incidentally, Toronto played their starters for much longer than did the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 for whatever that\xe2\x80\x99s worth.) When the smoke cleared, the O\xe2\x80\x99s trailed 7-2; if you lived and died with Grapefruit League results, you probably weren\xe2\x80\x99t too pleased at this point. However driven by a three-run triple by Francisco Peguero and a two-RBI single by Xavier Paul, the Orioles put the aforementioned seven runs on the board in the last of the eighth\xc2\xa0to take a 9-7 lead.For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, Josh \xe2\x80\x93 WAIT FOR IT \xe2\x80\x93 Stinson got the win in relief. (If you\xe2\x80\x99re like me and a mega-fan of CBS\xe2\x80\x99 show,\xc2\xa0How I Met Your Mother, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get the implication\xc2\xa0wait for it. If not, forget I mentioned it.) The guys who finished the game for the O\xe2\x80\x99s will probably not be on the final 25-man roster, however it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see that Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x98s concept of always playing until the final out is echoed at the top and all the way down to the bottom of the organization. What fans should have seen at the end of the game is a group of guys who are hungry, and who also know that if there\xe2\x80\x99s not a place for them on the Orioles or in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 organization there are plenty of other teams out there who might need players up and down their organizations.The Orioles will travel to Ft. Myers, FL to take on the Boston Red Sox this afternoon at 1 PM, with Brian Matusz getting the start for the Fighting Showalters. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Felix Doubront. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see which players the Orioles bring today, given the fact that it might behoove them to start seeing where they stack up against teams like Boston. It\xe2\x80\x99s also worth noting the interest that I\xe2\x80\x99m taking in the fact that Brian Matusz is starting today. Over the course of the winter Matusz expressed his yearn to be a starting pitcher, however with the addition of Ubaldo Jimenez those odds seem even more far-fetched than they did previously. So given the fact that the MLB Network is picking up NESN\xe2\x80\x99s (Boston\xe2\x80\x99s TV network) feed of the game nationally today\xe2\x80\xa6are the Orioles showcasing Matusz? If he pitches well in spring training, he might end up being one of those guys who\xe2\x80\x99s worth more to the organization on the trade block than he is on the roster.As I said above, fans can tune into MLB Network at 1 PM to see this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game if they wish. You can also hear the game via WBAL\xe2\x80\x99s broadcast with Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 announcers Joe Angel and Fred Manfra. On a side note, Henry Urrutia will miss a couple of days with a sore shoulder. It\xe2\x80\x99s not considered serious, but he\xe2\x80\x99s being held out as a precaution.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWe can also be pretty sure that it is not going to be Chris Davis, even though he batted leadoff in the intrasquad game the other day. I thought maybe Showalter was just messing with Crush, but I guess it was actually nothing more than an alphabetical order thing. And apparently it was the first time it had ever happened in Davis\xe2\x80\x99 baseball life.Frankly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this leadoff batter issue is a difficult decision. As far back as my 2011 Orioles blogging I was advocating for Nick Markakis in this role. He has perhaps the best batting eye in all of MLB, works pitchers into deep counts, and has always had a fine on-base percentage and batting average (even considering his drop-off of 2013).Over the past three seasons, Nick has accumulated more than a small sample size of statistics in the role. Over 88 games and 405 plate appearances, he has a slash line of .329/.375/.816 as the leadoff guy \xe2\x80\xa6 not bad at all!\xc2\xa0 Markakis looks very natural in the role, though it could be argued that he does not have the base-stealing speed most often associated with the #1 batter. I grant that this is true, but would argue that a player can have world-class track speed, but if he does not get on base, it is worthless.Markakis enters this season \xe2\x80\x93 the final of this contract \xe2\x80\x93 with a lot to prove after his sub-standard campaign of 2013. The series of nagging issues and that C.C. Sabathia ball that ended Nick\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 season are, in my view, the bulk of the reason for the drop-off of this past year. And the story is that Markakis is looking to be in beastly shape this spring and is full healthy. But even if he regains the power of the past, there is no need really for him to have to display it deeper into the lineup \xe2\x80\xa6 the Orioles are loaded with power at every turn.It also seems that the varied comments of Buck Showalter on the subject would lead the listener to believe that Markakis is the likely choice and frontrunner to be the first Oriole to come to the plate in the home opener.There are only a couple of possible scenarios as to who else might step into that role; and to force their way into it by their level of play is certainly what they will have to do.The next most likely candidate is new left fielder David Lough, who looked great in the leadoff position in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s home opener in Sarasota. He has the better speed to project as a more classic leadoff player, while also having at least some marginal power. Lough has a small sample size at leadoff, but it is decent \xe2\x80\xa6 over 19 games atop Royals\xe2\x80\x99 lineup last year he batted .271/.297/.626.\xc2\xa0 And then there is the possible scenario of Lough platooning with Nolan Reimold \xe2\x80\x93 another player who had great success in leadoff situations in 2012 before his own series of injuries began.An intriguing possibility is second baseman Jamile Weeks, who is a switch hitter with speed. And like everything else with the former A\xe2\x80\x99s player, there is the person who was awesome in 2011, but then the guy who has struggled ever since. He actually has 707 plate appearances leading off in his career with an OBP of .320.\xc2\xa0 And in 2011 as the A\xe2\x80\x99s leadoff hitter in 85 games, he had a slash line of .299/.338/.744 \xe2\x80\xa6 now THAT would be great to have!Weeks has made a very strong first impression this past week. We just need that to be repeated for weeks and weeks. (See what I did there?)\xc2\xa0 Honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99m pulling for this guy at second base over Flaherty, who in turn can be the super utility person. Though Flaherty has the greater power and probably the better defensive skills, I do not see him ever becoming even an average infielder offensively (other than power). I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be wrong on this judgment.The Orioles spring training is off to a great start, and it appears at this moment that the decisions to be made about personnel are going to be very difficult between varied good choices. And that reality is a testament to many good things and choices that have happened over recent years. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles rally in ninth but fall to Red Sox, 8-6, in first ...', "" Spring training is a lot like life in that it's ultimately meaningless and most people who are involved in it will leave it disappointed, their dreams never realized. It means something while it's happening, though. It's the only game in town, so they play, and we watch. Got to. This America, man.    Every now and again you get to see something you've never seen before, like on Sunday when the Orioles let pitching prospect Eduardo Rodriguez into the game for a couple of innings. Rodriguez is one of the guys it's worth getting excited about. Naturally, that means he wasn't very sharp today. It was his first taste of pitching to big league-caliber hitters. In typical Orioles pitching prospect style, he walked David Ortiz and allowed Mike Napoli to hit a home run before he ever even retired a batter. He may not have actually walked Ortiz with an objective, rulebook strike zone, but that's life. The next inning, Rodriguez was unfortunately victimized by a poor defensive play by Julio Borbon that allowed a run to score. If you're looking for something to hang your hat on, at least he was able to battle through the spots he found himself in without allowing major damage. Except four runs in two innings is kind of major damage. It would be nice if just one time, an Orioles pitching prospect could come up and just dominate everyone immediately, or at least be good immediately. Rodriguez has another month to work on things, and he has time left in the minors before they summon him too, so there's no point in worrying about him. In fact, maybe this taste of MLB competition will be just what he needs to show him what he still needs to work on.    Back on the subject of meaningless things, this game was started by Brian Matusz. It's nice that he can pretend to be a big league starter for a day. It's even nicer that he pitched a couple of scoreless innings. but we all know that there's no chance of him starting a game for the O's during the regular season unless things go horribly wrong. That ship sailed a long time ago. Delmon Young and Steve Pearce each had a pair of hits for the O's. Neither one seems likely to have a place on the team, in light of acquisitions that have been made, but they're making their case in the early days of spring training. The other day on the radio, I think it was Fred Manfra who was talking about Pearce and he referred to him as a veteran. Manny Machado has more MLB plate appearances than Pearce. he's just a guy who's kicked around the majors and minors a lot. He is a veteran of being designated for assignment. In the ninth inning, the Orioles decided to make it interesting, with the guys who were left in the game at that point getting five runs before Xavier Paul struck out looking to end the game. The rally included a two-run double by Jonathan Schoop that scored pinch-runner and Frank Robinson expert Josh Hart. Christian Walker and Buck Britton also had hits during the rally. With Paul's strikeout, the 8-6 final score was sealed and the O's had their first spring training loss in the books.    Game Notes:    One of the Orioles minor leaguers who came along on the road trip was Mike Yastrzemski, grandson of Baseball Hall of Famer Carl, who was in attendance. The younger Yastrzemski entered the game as a pinch runner and scored a run. This was probably done for sentimental reasons, and that's OK. He also walked in the ninth inning. Yastrzemski came on the trip to replace Henry Urrutia, who had a sore right shoulder. Urrutia told reporters that he thought it was just something that happened when he made a throw without properly warming up and he doesn't expect it to be a lingering issue. T.J. McFarland pitched for a little bit today. He sucked. The ninth inning pitcher for the Red Sox was Keith Couch. I have to imagine he was not a fan of a particular sketch from the Dave Chappelle Show. He also sucked and was lifted before getting through the inning.   "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
03/03/2014,"[('Orioles logo and uniform history - Camden Chat', ' After 52 years as the St. Louis Browns, the baseball club currently known as the Orioles moved to Baltimore in 1954. Adopting their name and colors from the state bird of Maryland, the Orioles have had varying degrees of success since moving to the Charm City.    The organization\'s most sustained period of success, including three World Series Championships, came with the Cartoon Bird on their caps, and after 14-consecutive losing seasons, the return of the beloved bird has brought the magic back to Camden Yards. With the help of Chris Creamer\'s Sports Logos and the\xc2\xa0Orioles logo page, I have compiled a complete hat logo and uniform history for the O\'s. Hat Logos: The Lead-Off Bird (1954-62)  For the Orioles\' first nine seasons, this realistic-looking bird adorned the team\'s caps. Baltimore managed only two winning seasons under this logo.  Orange ""B"" (1963)  The only season in team history that Baltimore\'s cap was bird-less, the Orioles were above .500, but finished the season 18.5 games behind American League Champion New York.     The Chirping Bird (1964-65)  After one season without, the bird returned to the Orioles\' cap. Finishing both seasons above .500, Baltimore won a then-franchise record 97 games in 1964.     The Original Cartoon Bird (1966-88)  While this logo had many adaptations during its 23 seasons on the Orioles\' cap, the Cartoon Bird is associated with the most successful period of Baltimore baseball. The Orioles had 19 winning seasons, including seven trips to the American League Championship Series, six pennants, and three World Series Championships. During this span, the O\'s were the winningest team in baseball.  The Ornithologically Correct Bird (1989-97)  Going into the 1990s, the Orioles removed the Cartoon bird from their caps in favor of another realistic-looking bird. Outside of a pair of ALCS losses to the Yankees and Indians, respectively, the ornithological bird has been associated with failure.     The Lifelike Bird (1998-2008)  Like its predecessor, the lifelike bird does not have the best track record. In the 10-year span that this bird was featured on the team\'s cap, the Orioles failed to record a winning season.  The Traditional Bird (2009-2011)  Although the changes may seem slight, this simplification of the Orioles\' lifelike logo removed any color outside of the team\'s orange, black, white, and gray scheme. This update also modified the bird\'s upright stance.  The New Cartoon Bird (2012-Present)  Baltimore introduced a modernized version of the Cartoon Bird as the team celebrated the 20th anniversary of Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The logo, which combines elements from the original Cartoon Bird and the O\'s current alternate cap, seemingly brought new life to a long-suffering franchise. In the first season with the updated logo, the Orioles finished above .500 for the first time in 14 seasons, as well as won the inaugural Wild Card Game. The following season, the team failed to make the playoffs, but finished above .500 for the second-consecutive year.     Uniforms: As you would expect in 1954, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first uniforms were quite plain. Both the white home uniform and the gray road jersey were devoid of any piping, featuring only a slanted script ""Orioles"" across the chest. The sloppy script was the epitome of the new franchise that would go on to lose 100 games in its inaugural season.  The following season, the Orioles improved their look by adding piping to the collar and sleeves of the uniform, as well as replacing the script across the chest with a different font. This uniform featured The Shoulder Patch Bird, the predecessor to the Cartoon Bird.  In 1956, the Orioles replaced the team nickname on the uniform with the city name, Baltimore, in a slanted script across the chest. The jerseys remained virtually unchanged, except for the addition of numbers to the front of the uniform, through the 1962 season.  The following year, the team decided to simplify its look. The Lead-Off Bird was removed from the cap in favor of the letter ""B"" and an arched, block ""Orioles"" replaced the script across the chest of every jersey. Luckily, this generic look did not last long in Baltimore.  The script wordmark was restored to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 uniform in 1966, just in time for the team to capture its first American League pennant and eventual World Series Championship. Although there would be slight variations in the shade of orange used by the Orioles, the Cartoon Bird, and the piping on the uniform\xe2\x80\x99s sleeves, this look would remain constant for the next two decades.     In 1971, the Orioles introduced their first alternate uniform. The all-orange uniforms, pants included, were worn during the season that produced a quartet of 20-game winners for Baltimore. The team experimented with pullover jerseys, as well, during this time period, but the look remained the same.  When the Orioles decided to ditch the Cartoon Bird for the Ornithologically Correct Bird, a new set of uniforms came with it. From 1989 through 1994, the Orioles uniforms featured an updated script, as well as new piping on the sleeves. The piping was similar to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 current uniforms, with a black-orange-black pattern on the white jersey.  Already wearing a black uniform for batting practice, the Orioles decided to make it an alternate for the 1993 season. A black jersey has been the team\xe2\x80\x99s Friday night alternate ever since.  In 1995, the Orioles seemingly rounded off the ""O"" and thickened the font in the script across the chest. The colors of the script were inverted, as well, marking the first time in almost 30 years that the wordmark was black with an orange outline.   A slight modification is made to the Orioles uniform in \'98, as the script is made thinner than the previous version. This change is in conjunction with the update to The Lifelike Bird on the cap.      During the 1999 season, twenty teams throughout Major League Baseball elected to wear uniforms in a futuristic style. For one game, the futuristic Orioles dropped orange from the color scheme, leaving only a white workmark on a black uniform.   Fifteen years after the colors were inverted, the script on the Orioles home white uniforms returned to orange with a black outline. This change made the uniforms aesthetically pleasing, as the wordmark matched the numbers on the uniforms.  Based upon a desire to celebrate the great teams of the past, the Orioles made a well-received change to their road uniforms in 2009. The script ""Baltimore"" made a return to the birds\xe2\x80\x99 road jersey for the first time in almost 40 years.  Along with The New Cartoon Bird, the Orioles unveiled a new orange uniform that has been worn during Saturday home games throughout the season. Not only was the 2012 season the 20th anniversary of Oriole Park at Camden Yards, but marks 20 years since the Orioles donned orange uniforms.

He would be the latest reclamation project under executive vice president Dan Duquette.Santana \xe2\x80\x94 who will be 35 this month \xe2\x80\x94 was once one of the best left-handed pitchers in the game, but he did not pitch at all last season after his second shoulder surgery in three seasons last April to repair a torn anterior capsule. He has pitched in just 21 games since the end of the 2010 season.Santana will likely report to the team\xe2\x80\x99s minor league camp at Twin Lakes Park, where he will continue rehabbing and strengthing his shoulder. var adSkipCounter = 0; There is no clear timetable for Santana\xe2\x80\x99s return, but he could return by June, according to an industry source.The Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they will get from Santana, but a minor league deal offers little risk and high return if he is anywhere close to his former self.Under Duquette, the Orioles have a history of giving opportunity to veteran pitchers looking for another chance. Over the past two seasons, the club has signed left-hander Dontrelle Willis, right-hander Freddy Garcia and left-hander Jamie Moyer to minor league deals. Garcia was the only one of that group to make it to the majors, with the other two veterans exercising opt-out clauses in their contracts.Even this season, the Orioles signed veteran slugger Jack Cust \xe2\x80\x94 who also didn\xe2\x80\x99t play in the majors in 2013 \xe2\x80\x94 to a minor league deal following a minicamp tryout in January. Two years ago, the Orioles gave Miguel Tejada a minor league deal for his third stint in the organization, but he also took an opt-out.The Orioles were one of several teams to scout Santana last week during a bullpen session in Fort Myers, Fla. During that session, Santana\xe2\x80\x99s fastball reportedly topped out at just 81 mph, even though he did show flashes of the changeup that made him so tough when he was healthy.After the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 9-2 exhibition loss to the Minnesota Twins at Ed Smith Stadium on Monday, Orioles manager Buck Showalter wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk specifics about any impending deal with Santana.\xe2\x80\x9cI told you when we started, there\xe2\x80\x99s irons in the fire,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s been going on for quite some time. Certain things like that come to fruition at different times. ...\xe2\x80\x9dFrom 2004 to 2008, Santana was one of the best and most durable left-handers in baseball. He won the AL Cy Young Award in 2004 and 2006 with the Twins and finished among the top five votegetters for the Cy Young in each of the other three seasons, posting 219 innings or more in each of those campaigns.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that in the past he was one of the best,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles first baseman Chris Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cHopefully, he can regain his form and be a help for us. There are some things you just can\xe2\x80\x99t coach and experience is one of those things and he definitely brings that to the table.\xe2\x80\x9dSantana had his first shoulder surgery on Sept. 14, 2010 less than three years into a six-year deal with the New York Mets that paid him $137.5 million, including a $5.5 million buyout on their $25 million club option for 2014.Santana is 139-78 with a 3.20 ERA over his career, but he is just 6-9 with a 4.85 ERA in 21 starts since his first shoulder surgery.The Orioles came under scrutiny this offseason when the club pulled away from two major league deals \xe2\x80\x94 including a two-year, $15 million deal with closer Grant Balfour \xe2\x80\x94 when concerns arose during the players\xe2\x80\x99 club physical.

It\'s ""scope.""The 22-year-old Curacao native would seem to be on a fast track to the big leagues with the Orioles except that he hangs in fast company and some of his best friends are wondering what\'s taking him so long.Well, if guys like Manny Machado and Jurickson Profar would have just let Schoop keep playing shortstop.Machado, with whom Schoop became tight coming through the Orioles system, debuted in Baltimore at 20 and the only thing that\'s stopped him since is the knee injury that prematurely ended his 2013 season but is looking less and less likely to keep him from the lineup on Opening Day or very shortly after.Profar, with whom Schoop regularly hangs out and works out with back home, debuted with Texas at age 19 two seasons ago, was a Rangers part-timer last year and now will be the starting second baseman \xe2\x80\x93 like Schoop moving from his natural shortstop.""I just want to play, you know,"" says Schoop, sitting at his locker as Machado breezes by and suggests his buddy be tested with tougher questions.Schoop is having a strong spring and asking the difficult question of manager Buck Showalter, who\'s been non-committal so far.It\'s not like the Orioles jumped into the Robinson Cano sweepstakes over the winter. They have plenty of candidates besides Schoop to play second base but none can realistically be considered much more than a placeholder.Jemile Weeks, acquired from Oakland, hasn\'t had his prospect label completely scraped off. Alexi Casilla has. Ryan Flaherty? Ivan DeJesus? Cord Phelps? There\'s a utility guy and a couple of future Norfolk Tides in there somewhere.Schoop has a couple of things going for him beyond the talent that projects him hitting for average with decent power for a middle infielder. He\'s on the 40-man roster, eliminating service-time issues, and he\'s been in big league camp before, wiping out any questions he might have had about belonging.""When you first get here, you realize you\'re here with all these good guys,"" Schoop says. ""But, you know, I can play here.""Since Machado has moved to third, there\'s no competition with Schoop over who\'s the better shortstop \xe2\x80\x93 for now, anyway, with J.J. Hardy entering the final year of his contract though an extension isn\'t totally out of the question.As for back home, who gets to play where when Schoop and Profar get together?""I don\'t know, I don\'t care"" Schoop says. ""We just throw it around. It\'s pretty much the same (at any infield position). If you can handle shortstop, I think you can handle the other positions.""***\xc2\xa0(Photo: Gene J. Puskar, AP)The stakes are raisedThe Orioles are almost giddy over their sudden rash of signings just as camp opened \xe2\x80\x93 outfielder Nelson Cruz plus pitchers Ubaldo Jimenez and Suk-Min Yoon, with Johan Santana a distinct possibility.The moves quieted the criticism back home over the front office going into virtual hibernation in a winter that was looking rather rough not only for the weather that\'s hit that part of the country.General manager Dan Duquette\'s patience got him to a point that the deal look to be significant bargains in his mind. Certainly Cruz at $8 million is a discount over the $14.1 million qualifying offer he rejected, even coming off his 50-game drug suspension t the end of last season.But it\'s Duquette and the Orioles who actually are raising the stakes \xe2\x80\x93 at least over how they continue to do business.They\'ve been a ""Little Engine That Could"" story the past two years with payrolls of $84.1 million and $92.2 million. They used 52 players in each of those years, cashing in on Nate McLouth-style true bargains.Now, they\'ll run the same gamble at higher prices \xe2\x80\x93 and boost the payroll some more, probably past $100 million.Cruz, 33, is coming off a year in which he reversed a two-year decline in his numbers, most notably slugging percentage, before the suspension. How those factor mesh going forward is anybody\'s guess.Jimenez had a 1.72 earned run average over his final 12 starts last season. He hasn\'t pitched like that since his first 12 starts of 2010, when he had a 0.93 ERA for Colorado.He got to 15-1 and started the All-Star Game in 2010 but also had a 4.34 ERA over his final 19 starts that year. He couldn\'t even match the 4.34 the next two seasons.So, here\'s guy with two great runs \xe2\x80\x93 totaling maybe a full season\'s worth of pitching \xe2\x80\x93 since he got to the majors at the tail end of the 2006 season. Showalter indicates he and his staff already had some mechanical tweaks in mind for Jimenez before the Orioles snagged him.And then there\'s Yoon, whose name Showalter jokes he just can\'t match up with his own down-home accent. At $5.575 million over three years \xe2\x80\x93 as a Scott Boras client \xe2\x80\x93 those numbers might give a better indication than the 2011 MVP in Korea\'s pro league striking better than a batter per inning there last year.Uh, oh, curve ballsThe internal scouting report on Jimenez is all about the curve ball.Casilla and Jimenez were teammates as kids in the Dominican Republic.Casilla remembers vividly what make his friend so dominant \xe2\x80\xa6(Kids and overzealous parents, stop reading right now.)""Nobody wanted him to pitch because he used to throw a lot of curveballs,"" Casilla says of the kid he remembers as remarkably skinny. ""He had a high, slow curveball. Nobody liked it.""OK, he got to the majors and nobody\'s suggesting any issues from snapping off breaking balls with an arm not fully developed.Besides, as Casilla can attest, the big bender remains a weapon.They went head-to-head in 2012 at Minnesota. Casilla popped out, grounded out and sacrificed in three plate appearances.""He threw me 11 pitches and he threw me nine breaking balls,"" Casilla says. ""I\'ve known him since I was 11. The next day, I was running outside and I said, \'Hey, nice breaking balls, man. That curveball is pretty good.\'""He went like, \'Hey, I know you very good.\' ""\xc2\xa0(Photo: Louis Requena, MLB Photos via Getty Images)***SnapshotOn one of Showalter\'s first days on the job in Baltimore late in the 2010 season, he sat in his office and asked Orioles Hall of Famer Jim Palmer for a list of the team\'s former players still living in the Baltimore area.SHOWALTER: Makes prospect write a paper about Frank RobinsonShowalter was determined to mine franchise pride he thought had gone missing.He was right.""For 13 years, I\'ve had this shirt in the closet and I didn\'t wear it,"" said Frank Robinson, another Hall of Famer, when he addressed the current Orioles before a workout this spring.The shirt is orange.""The last couple of years, I\'ve broken it out and I wear it because I\'m very proud of this team,"" Robinson says, admitting yet scoffing at the idea he\'s supposed to be neutral in his job in Major League Baseball\'s offices. ""It\'s back to pride in the Orioles. I told them I don\'t believe my blood is orange like Tommy (Lasorda\'s) is (Dodgers) blue but I\'m an Oriole through and through because this is where I had the most team success and the greatest individual success of my career.""But the MVP award Robinson won in Baltimore came 48 years ago. He played his last game and broke the managerial color barrier before any current Orioles were born.The players who\'ve been on the roster for a few seasons get it. Palmer is a broadcaster with the team. Robinson has been around as the franchise has ramped up the connections with the past by erecting statues of its Hall of Famers.Still, as Showalter and Robinson passed 2013 draft pick Josh Hart in the hallway before Robinson addressed the team, the generation gap hit home. Hart, an African-American, admitted he didn\'t recognize the guest.""I said, \'OK, by tomorrow, this time, I want a page about Frank Robinson,\' "" Showalter says. ""I said, \'You go home, research it and you come back tomorrow and have it on my desk.\' ""Hart did and admitted he was thrilled with his history lesson.Showalter is far from finished. During the team\'s surprising 2012 run to the playoffs, he said his goal was to make baseball relevant in Baltimore again.Mission accomplished.Next?""I want Cal (Ripken) here yesterday,"" Showalter says. ""Cal is so dad-gum busy. He\'s come a couple of times \xe2\x80\xa6 and Eddie Murray, too.""There\'s such a fine line,"" Showalter says. ""You don\'t want to confuse changes with lack of respect for tradition. It\'s not necessarily change. What you want to have in common with them is winning.

""I\'m not going to say no risk, as far as, I\'m not the owner, but it\'s another thing that Peter (Angelos) allowed us to do that puts us in position to get kind of lucky. I\'m not going to say it\'s a no lose proposition. There are things you lose, but it makes a risk worth taking. I think it\'s exciting, the possibility down the road.""Santana is expected to report Wednesday. The Orioles are hopeful that he might be ready to pitch in the majors around June 1.Santana can earn $2.1 million in bonuses based on days on the active 25-man roster: $250,000 for 30, $350,000 for 60, $500,000 for 90 and $1 million for 120.He can make $2.95 million based on starts: $250,000 for five, $350,000 for 10, $500,000 for 15, $750,000 for 20, $150,000 each for 21 and 22, $200,000 apiece for 23 and 24, and $400,000 for 25.He has additional award bonuses for All-Star selection, and winning a Gold Glove and the Comeback Player of the Year and league championship series and World Series MVP awards.Santana would get $100,000 if he is released before March 25.

03/05/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Ranking the AL East Center Fielders', 'Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe rankings of the positions in the AL East chugs along to center field, an area where there is tight competition at the top.\xc2\xa0 One of those players has traded a World Series for pinstripes, but is he first on the list\xe2\x80\xa6Also, I included most of the backup outfielders in the LF rankings, but some guys are certainly more suited for CF.\xc2\xa0 They will be included among the backups.\xc2\xa0 And if you are looking for the past rankings, they are all located at the bottom.1. Baltimore OriolesAdam Jones, Francisco Peguero, Quintin Berry, Julio BorbonJones takes the top spot for the Orioles in a very close competition with Jacoby Ellsbury.\xc2\xa0 I saw another ranking recently, and someone asked, would you trade Jones for Ellsbury straight up.\xc2\xa0 I think Brian Cashman would say yes every time.\xc2\xa0 Both are above average defenders, but Jones provides some of the best power from the CF position in the AL, as evident from his silver slugger award in 2013. Jones has only missed two games over the past two seasons.\xc2\xa0 His batting average over the last four years has been between .280 and .290 each year, but Jones does not take a lot of walks.\xc2\xa0 So you have to live with the low OBP, but the number of home runs he hits, 30+ the last two seasons, makes up for it.Peguero came to the Orioles from the San Francisco Giants and is fighting for a roster spot, while Berry, a close friend of Jones as detailed here, was signed to a minor league deal; and Borbon was a minor-league Rule 5 pick, despite having major league experience.\xc2\xa0 Chances are with the O\xe2\x80\x99s wanting to keep Delmon Young that none of these three make the team, and David Lough would shift to CF if Jonesy needs a day off.2. New York YankeesJacoby Ellsbury, Ichiro Suzuki, Slade HeathcottEllsbury comes in a close second after leaving Boston for New York.\xc2\xa0 While Jones brings power to the center field position, Ellsbury brings speed.\xc2\xa0 In his career year of 2011, Ellsbury did hit 32 home runs on his way to being a silver slugger, gold glover, All-Star and second in the MVP race.\xc2\xa0 However, every other year he has hit less than 10 home runs.\xc2\xa0 He has been in the top 10 in stolen bases three times, including 2013 when he swiped 52 bags.\xc2\xa0 However, there are concerns about his durability.\xc2\xa0 The Yankees are paying him over 20 million a year for a player older than Jones, so they hope he can stay healthy.\xc2\xa0 Ellsbury\xe2\x80\x99s average numbers have been a bit inconsistent, but his career average of .297 is certainly quite high, and anytime he gets on base he makes it tough on opposing pitchers.If Ellsbury was to need a day off, or get injured, the capable but aging Ichiro is the backup, and at his age playing CF he would be a liability.3. Tampa Bay RaysDesmond Jennings, Brandon GuyerStop me if you have heard this before, Jennings numbers aren\xe2\x80\x99t overly impressive.\xc2\xa0 It seems like there are a number of Rays about whom I have said the same, but he fits their offense.\xc2\xa0 Only a career .250 hitter, Jennings supplies plus speed and some power in the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 OF.\xc2\xa0 Another very sound defender in center, Jennings typically bats in one of the first slots in the Rays batting order and sets the table for their offense.His backup will be Brandon Guyer, who has a decent chance of making the team.\xc2\xa0 If not, David DeJesus would likely slide over from LF and let Matt Joyce or Sean Rodriguez play left.4. Toronto Blue JaysColby Rasmus, Anthony Gose, Kevin PillarColby Rasmus is a player, like many on the Jays, that they are hoping puts it all together.\xc2\xa0 In five big league seasons, he has played more than 100 games each year.\xc2\xa0 He has two seasons with a batting average of .276, two seasons with a batting average of .225 and .223 and one at .251, which was his rookie year.\xc2\xa0 That all averages out to .248 batting average.\xc2\xa0 Rasmus also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take many walks, but does have the ability to hit with some power, as evident by having 20 plus HRs three times in five years.\xc2\xa0 Not a big stolen base guy, Rasmus has the required speed for a center fielder, but is also likely the worst defensively out of all the CFs in the AL East.Gose is his backup, and many think could someday force Rasmus to a corner outfield position as he was considered one of the Jays top prospects. Gose came to the Jays in the Roy Halladay trade and has appeared in over 50 games each of the last two years, starting 49 and 37 in 2012 and 2013 respectively.5. Boston Red SoxJackie Bradley Jr., Grady Sizemore, Scott CousinsThe Red Sox were alright with Jacoby Ellsbury leaving because they weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to give him the outrageous contract the Yankees did, and they have Bradley ready for the majors.\xc2\xa0 Bradley Jr. was drafted in the first round in 2011, and at 23, is another young player ready to make his mark on the Sox.\xc2\xa0 Just like Xander Bogaerts, I have to rank him last because it is hard to tell what to expect.\xc2\xa0 He started 26 games in 2013 and struggled, hitting to only a .189 average with 18 hits and 31 strikeouts.\xc2\xa0 Bradley has some speed, as evident by his 24 stolen bases in the minors in 2012.\xc2\xa0 But he isn\xe2\x80\x99t a big home run guy, and his numbers in the minors are largely uneven.If Bradley struggles in the majors, Sizemore is attempting to prove he can be a major league player again this year. Otherwise, the Red Sox may be stuck moving Shane Victorino to center field and being weaker in the outfield.As always, feel free to sound off if you disagree.\xc2\xa0 And for the previous rankings, check out the links below:LF3BSS2B1BC ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('With Roberts, Yanks Hope Imperfect Piece Is Good Fit - The ...', '     Supported by    Baseball  With Roberts, Yanks Hope Imperfect Piece Is Good Fit    On Baseball  By                       TYLER KEPNER   MARCH 4, 2014     Continue reading the main story Share This Page  Continue reading the main story                if (             window.magnum             && window.magnum.getFlags().indexOf(\'headlineBalancer\') > 0             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.shouldRun()         ) {             window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize();         }         Photo       Brian Roberts, right, led the A.L. in doubles in 2009.

Probably, it was the explosion of their payroll, demonstrated again with their $500 million off-season.At some point, the Yankees became the team that must have a perfect roster. Their willingness to spend, the thinking goes, should create at least the illusion of certainty at every position.\xe2\x80\x9cI think that\xe2\x80\x99s become an expectation now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yankees Manager Joe Girardi, a former catcher with the team. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look at some of the early championships in the \xe2\x80\x9990s, and that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily the case.\xe2\x80\x9dGirardi pointed to some positions on those teams that looked imperfect on their face: catcher, third base, outfield platoons. \xe2\x80\x9cIt definitely can work, and it worked at a pretty high level,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve just got to get your pieces to fit right and use them right.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees have pieces to fill in for Robinson Cano at second base and Alex Rodriguez at third.The one they are counting on most is Brian Roberts, who started at second base and hit cleanup on Tuesday night against his old team, the Baltimore Orioles. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Cano did not run fast but otherwise was about as flawless a player as you could find. The Seattle Mariners invested $240 million in that belief, leaving the Yankees with a question at second base for the first time since Tony Womack yielded to Cano in early 2005. Photo       Roberts has missed 456 games in the last four seasons because of injuries.  Credit             Barton Silverman/The New York Times           Citing Womack\xe2\x80\x99s regrettable tenure (one season with the Yankees and a .276 on-base percentage) underscores just how much of a fixture Cano became. The Roberts of 2009 would be an excellent replacement; he led the league in doubles while stealing 30 bases. But Roberts has missed 456 games in the last four seasons, while Cano missed just 14 in the last seven.A strained abdominal muscle, a concussion, a strained groin muscle and a labral hip tear caused most of those absences for Roberts. He left last spring training healthy but almost immediately strained his hamstring. He missed about three months and finished with a .249 average in 77 games.

I expected to play 155 games those years, too.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees cannot plan just one day ahead, of course, and Girardi said he wanted to play Roberts as often as he could. It seems far-fetched to think of Roberts as a regular, but he played his second game in a row on Tuesday and said he felt strong.Billy Eppler, the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 assistant general manager, said he called Roberts\xe2\x80\x99s agent during the first week of free agency, long before Cano signed with Seattle. Whether Roberts would be a part-time or a full-time option, the Yankees wanted him.

Credit             Barton Silverman/The New York Times           For every Chavez and Ibanez, who made a positive impact in a late-career Yankee cameo, there has been a Travis Hafner or a Kevin Youkilis, who arrived with nothing left. The Yankees invested $2 million in Roberts and $3 million in another second baseman, Kelly Johnson, who will play mostly third.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Eduardo Nunez is still around, and the Yankees smartly re-signed Brendan Ryan, a defensive wizard who can back up Derek Jeter at shortstop and help at second and third.

03/06/2014,"[(""Zach Britton hurt in Baltimore Orioles' win - Birds Watcher"", 'Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitcher Zach Britton was hit on the bottom of his glove by a comebacker in last night\xe2\x80\x99s 11-5 victory over Minnesota. After the game Buck Showalter said that Britton might end up with a bruise, but that he should be okay \xe2\x80\x93 no x-ray\xe2\x80\x99s needed. According to Showalter the ball mainly hit Britton\xe2\x80\x99s glove; and for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to come out of the game. But this does invoke some bad memories for O\xe2\x80\x99s fans, who still remember former pitcher Brad Bergesen being hit by a comebacker off the bat of Kansas City\xe2\x80\x99s Brett Butler.The good news in general is that Britton appears like he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be okay. Perhaps the best news of the day for the Birds however came in the context of the 11-5 victory. Chris Tillman allowed three runs, but only one of them earned. Showalter said after the game that in his mind it should have been zero; Tillman himself also said afterwards that he was happy with his performance. Backup catcher candidate Johnny Monell\xe2\x80\x99s three-run homer was also part of a five-run rally in the third inning. My personal opinion is that Monell will probably end up being Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s starting catcher, as the Orioles will probably keep Steve Clevenger. However it\xe2\x80\x99s good to know that they have catchers in the system that have plate presence and so forth.The Orioles will return to Sarasota this afternoon to take on Tampa at 1 PM. Manager Buck Showalter and several players will be leaving camp at some point tomorrow (possibly during their game) and flying briefly to Baltimore to attend the services for Monica Barlow, the team\xe2\x80\x99s late Director of PR. For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth to fans, owner Peter Angelos paid out of his pocket to expand the number of seats on the team\xe2\x80\x99s plane so that all of the players, coaches, and staff who wanted to attend would have the option of doing so.

03/07/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Ranking the AL East Right Fielders', 'Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsRanking the right fielders in the AL East is not at all an easy exercise.\xc2\xa0 Every team but the Tampa Bay Rays features a veteran at the position, all players who have been quite successful over their career.Because of that, the position is very much up for debate.\xc2\xa0 Read my rankings and then comment and let me know why I am wrong!1. New York YankeesCarlos Beltran, Ichiro SuzukiLet\xe2\x80\x99s start with age.\xc2\xa0 Beltran is 36 years old, and was just given a 3-year, $45 million contract by the New York Yankees.\xc2\xa0 This will be Beltran\xe2\x80\x99s 17th season in the major leagues, and the eight-time All-Star comes off a very successful 2013 with the St. Louis Cardinals.\xc2\xa0 A lifetime .283 hitter, Beltran has driven in over 100 runs eight times.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately for Yankees fans, the last of those 8 times was in 2009.\xc2\xa0 Carlos is no longer the speed threat he once was, and also has lost some luster in the field with age.\xc2\xa0 But, he still heads up the right field rankings due to the consistent success he has had, despite aging.His backup, Ichiro is not a spring chicken either.\xc2\xa0 At 40 years old, Ichiro no longer will put up a season where he has over 200 hits and hits over .300, and that is why the Yankees have him in a reserve role, although he easily could see time at DH as well.\xc2\xa0 The Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 number of aging players is staggering, and if age catches up to a number of them, it will be a long season for the pinstripe-clad crew.2. Baltimore OriolesNick Markakis,\xc2\xa0Delmon Young, Francisco PegueroAnother make no mistake about it, despite all the depth in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 outfield, RF is Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 territory.\xc2\xa0 To be honest, I had Markakis ranked last until I looked at the stats.\xc2\xa0 But when I did that, and you factor in his age compared to the other players in the division, I realized he deserved to be much, much higher.

Toronto Blue JaysJose Bautista, Kevin Pillar, Moises SierraBautista, 33, has been an All-Star each of the last four seasons as he basks in the glow of leading the majors in home runs in 2010 and 2011.\xc2\xa0 But a look at his numbers reveals something alarming.\xc2\xa0 Those two years, were the best years of his career BY FAR.\xc2\xa0 In fact, a lot of that had to do with the fact he stayed healthy and played in 161 games in 2010, and 149 in 2011.\xc2\xa0 In his career, he only has one other season in which he has played more than 130 games, and that was back in 2007.\xc2\xa0 Bautista has a great eye and will often take as many walks as he does strike out.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, playing in Rogers Centre in Toronto has helped his numbers, as before 2010 he never hit over 16 home runs.\xc2\xa0 A career .254 hitter, Bautista has only hit better than .260 once, and that was in 2011 when he led the majors in on-base percentage and was third in the MVP race.\xc2\xa0 And the defensive numbers are not really great either, as Bautista is more of a liability than he is a solid defender.\xc2\xa0 The Jays are going to have to hope the slugger can stay healthy in 2014.Sierra and Pillar are fighting to make the team as the reserve corner outfielder.\xc2\xa0 I think Pillar gets the nod, but neither player has had a lot of success at the major league level, albeit in limited opportunities last season.5.

I don't remember a time in my life when I didn't love Brady Anderson. He began playing for the Orioles when I was nine years old and didn't stop until I was 22. That's time to build a lot of history, and Brady certainly made the most of his playing days. Really, Brady is still an Oriole. He has spent years working around the organization and with the players, and for the last few years has worked in the O's front office, currently as the Vice President of Baseball Operations.    Brady Anderson was drafted in the 10th round of the 1985 amateur draft by the Boston Red Sox and came to the Orioles along with Curt Schilling in a trade for Mike Boddicker at the trade deadline in 1988. He was something of a late bloomer, and didn't become a regular player for the Orioles until 1991 when he was 27 years old. His first big season came the following year, 1992. That season he hit .271/.373/.449 an OPS+ of 130 and wOBA of .366 and 53 stolen bases. Oh, to have a guy like that leading off for the current Orioles. Brady's OBP over his Orioles career was .364, which is very nice indeed. And while he always knew how to take a walk, with a career walk rate of 12.4%, he also had another way to supplement his on-base percentage. Simply put, he was very good at getting hit by pitches. Anyone who spent the 1990s as an Orioles fan surely has a mental picture tucked away in his or her brain of Brady crowding the plate and then simply turning and letting pitches hit him in the back or leg or butt. He didn't dive in front of pitches, but he never ducked away from them either. In his career he got hit by a pitch a total of 154 times, which is 14th best in baseball history. 148 of those HBP came when he was an Oriole, which easily gives him the highest mark in team history (#2 is Melvin Mora at 107, and Cal Ripken comes in third with 66). Three times in his career he led the league in HBP. His best season was 1996, and it's also the season that causes people to look at his home run total and his muscles and speculate that he was doing something untoward to get those results. But as I once heard Brady say (when we were on the radio together, AKA best day of my life), if he was able to use steroids and be that good for just one season, why did he stop being so good after that? At any rate, 1996 was a crazy year for him. He posted the highest slugging % and second-highest OBP of his career as he mashed 50 home runs and 27 doubles.    If his power was a fluke, his ability to get on base certainly wasn't. In 1997 he dropped down to a home run total of 18, but his OBP was .393, just .003 less than in '96. His skills at the plate were a big part of what helped the O's get to the playoffs in both 1996 and 1997. Those were the only two years in Brady's career that he played in the postseason, but he made the most of them.  In 92 postseason plate appearances, he hit .300/.380/.575 with 6 home runs. I was lucky enough to go to one game of the 1996 ALDS against the Indians, and when the Orioles clinched in 1997 I knew I had to go back. Armed with my mother's credit card, I called the Ticketmaster phone number over and over and over again. By the time I got through the busy signal they only had single seats left for game one of the ALCS, also against the Indians. I had been planning on buying tickets for myself and my brother, but he didn't want to sit by himself at the game. So instead I just bought one single ticket for myself. My mom wasn't amused at the idea of her teenage daughter going into Baltimore by herself, but there was no stopping me. Brady rewarded me with a leadoff home run in a game that the O's ended up winning 3-0. Speaking of leadoff home runs, Brady was kind of known for them. Of his 210 career home runs, 44 of them were in his first at-bat of the game. He even did it in four games in a row in April 1996.    Brady's final season with the Orioles was 2001, the same year that Cal Ripken called it quits. At 37 years old, he just couldn't hack it any more. His last Orioles at bat was a strikeout, and most people remember it as the strikeout that left Cal Ripken on deck to end the season. Oops. He tried to play one more year in 2002, signing on with the Cleveland Indians, but was released in May. Personally, I like to pretend that year never happened and that Brady finished his career with the O's. Brady ranks high on the Orioles leaderboard in a number of categories. He is 6th in home runs and games played, second in walks, and first in stolen bases. He was inducted into the Orioles Hall of Fame in 2004, and I may or may not have this poster in my laundry room.

Hardy, Matt Wieters, and Chris Davis have stalled, might as well give him the money.At the very least, it will make the Orioles flush with starting pitching by mid-season, when Kevin Gausman has done all he can in AAA.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that Zach Britton looks good after just a few weeks of working with Dave Wallace.Too much pitching is never a problem, but the Orioles will have to figure out what to do with all the options, whether they sign Santana or not.

But then fact is that the Baltimore Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t just look good. They looked\xc2\xa0darned good\xc2\xa0in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s win. And before you look at the score and assume that Philadephia brought a group of scrubs to Sarasota, they had most of their A-teamers in the game. The O\xe2\x80\x99s just flat out beat them.Courtesy of Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY SportsUbaldo Jimenez made his Orioles debut, and looked every bit worth the money the Birds are paying him. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 2 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 3 K. Jimenez was even credited with the win, which was really more of a technicality than anything else. However Jimenez was solid, as is evidenced by throwing two perfect innings. But before we put him in Cooperstown\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s one spring training start. But he held down a potent (but aging) Philadelphia lineup throughout his two innings. From a pitching perspective, the only real scare was Miguel Gonzalez being the second Orioles pitcher in as many games to get hit by a comebacker. Gonzalez faced three batters, and left the game as soon as he was hit \xe2\x80\x93 he has a bruised leg as a result.As is evidenced by the 15 runs, Oriole bats were hot in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game. Nick Markakis went 4-for-4 on the day, with a single, two doubles, and a triple. Ryan Flaherty and Jonathan Schoop also homered on the day for the Orioles, who\xe2\x80\x99s relief pitching was dominant throughout the day. Matt Wieters, Jermile Weeks (who got the start at second base yesterday), Ryan Flaherty, and J.J. Hardy each drove in two runs, Hardy doing it with three hits on the day.Again, people should take results like these with a grain of salt. However it\xe2\x80\x99s worth pointing out that the Orioles looked crisp, while if you\xe2\x80\x99re a Philadelphia fan you probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t come away from the game with the same impression. However what should impress fans the most from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint are things such as Nick Markakis extending a double into a triple in the last of the fourth. In an exhibition game the O\xe2\x80\x99s were winning 6-2 at the time, that might not seem like a big deal. However it shows that Markakis is an intelligent base runner, who used his knowledge of right field to his advantage in terms of how much time the Philadelphia right fielder had to get the ball back in.Markakis would later come into score on a wild pitch, which again illustrates the importance of smart base running. Odds are Markakis would have made it to third on that wild pitch from second, and later scored on what would have been a Chris Davis flyout, however the point is that the Birds were able to tack on a run that they otherwise might not have had. Immediately following Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 at-bat Adam Jones worked the count and drew a walk, which again is something that should give Orioles fans a lot of hope. If Jones can start working the count more often he\xe2\x80\x99ll see better pitches. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying that for a few years, and it applies to several different players (league-wide). Ultimately these games aren\xe2\x80\x99t as much about wins and losses as they are the mechanics of the game, and how the games themselves unfold.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are back on MASN again this afternoon at 1 PM as Boston comes to Sarasota for the first time this spring. Kevin Gausman will get his first start of the spring for the Orioles today, although it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99ll be facing Boston\xe2\x80\x99s A-team.

Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day pitched a perfect frame in the afternoon (throwing some newly-learned change-ups), while Tim Berry looked extraordinary in two innings to finish the game.

(This might help make the Sox wish they had him back, which, of course, may well happen). Almanzar would add another RBI in the next inning where the wheels completely came off for the Red Sox, as the Orioles used a series of errors and hits to score five more runs before an out could be registered.

03/10/2014,"[('Top 40 Orioles of All Time: #10, Bobby Grich - Camden Chat', "" #10 - Bobby Grich, 2B (1970-1976) As Stacey and I were compiling our top 40 Orioles list, we consulted the career Wins Above Replacement for a number of players to see where our recollections of these great Orioles matched up with reality. When I looked at that list and saw Bobby Grich so high up on the O's franchise leaderboard, I wondered how that could possibly be so. Then I looked at Grich's career stats, both in and out of an Orioles uniform, and I was left wondering why he isn't in the Baseball Hall of Fame.    It's true that Grich only played five seasons with the O's where he logged significant time, and for most of those he was along for the ride in an infield that contained three great Orioles yet to come on our countdown - Brooks Robinson, Mark Belanger, and Boog Powell. What's a second baseman who played in 786 games in an O's uniform compared to that? Would you settle for a three-time All Star and four-time Gold Glove winner? What about a guy who was among the five best position players in the American League every year for five straight years? Not that the MVP voters of the day noticed, but that's exactly what he was. Maybe it's also because, among second basemen, Hall of Famer Joe Morgan spent 1972-1976 going completely bonkers. That's some tough timing. The thing that Grich brought to the table was value both offensively and defensively. Where the majority of his positional competition on other teams during his O's time could neither get on base nor hit for power, Grich was able to do both. He walked, he hit doubles, and he even had double-digit home runs every year. He did all of this while playing defense that contemporary measures rate as being excellent. 1973 Grich was very nearly as good as 2013 Manny Machado defensively, according to Fangraphs numbers.    Over that five-year stretch, Grich batted a combined .263/.374/.410, which is a nice reminder that it's possible for a player to take a free base every now and again. He averaged 89 walks per year for those five years, which worked out to a walk in 13.8% of his plate appearances. The modern day Orioles have not had a player with 89+ walks in any of the last five years.    Grich had an OPS+ of 127 in his O's tenure, meaning he was 27% better than the average player, hitting well enough that his bat would have played in a number of positions. Since he was great at playing second base, he was far beyond most of his peers at that spot. He just missed the real glory years. Being drafted in the first round of the 1967 draft - the pick (#19 overall) the Orioles received for having been American League and World Series champions the previous year - meant that by the time Grich was ready for major league action, the three-year stretch of American League Champion Orioles had already come and gone, though Grich did get a cup of coffee in the big leagues in 1970 and 1971. With the advent of free agency, he was off of the team before the late-70s and early-80s saw more great Orioles teams.    Perhaps that also contributes to why his great Orioles legacy is forgotten. It's hard to stand out among that crowd. Still, the quality of his resume can't be denied. He may have only spent five full years on the Orioles, but they were five years that were so good as to propel him up among the greatest Orioles of all time. Looking back through the annals of baseball writer voting produces some head-scratchers from time to time. The fact that Grich fell off the ballot in 1992, his first year of eligibility, is one of those mysteries. How could a guy with his career get only 11 votes out of 450 cast? Grich and future Hall of Famer Rod Carew both spent the tail ends of their careers with the California Angels. They were teammates for seven seasons. All would agree that Carew is a no-doubt, slam-dunk Hall of Fame second baseman. The thing is that in those seven years, Carew played two games at second base because Grich was better at the position.    If they ever correct the oversight that Grich is missing from the Hall, perhaps he will even go in as an Oriole. He played more years in California, but he played his best years in Baltimore. Though he may have been snubbed by the wider Baseball Hall of Fame, the Orioles Hall of Fame recognized one of their great players by inducting him in 1998. His four Gold Gloves are most for a second baseman in the history of the franchise, and tied for fourth-most for the franchise as a whole. Jim Palmer and Mike Mussina - also great Orioles still to come - have four Gold Gloves as well. Grich did not have the fortunate timing to be on any of the greatest Orioles teams, but he is nonetheless one of the ten greatest Orioles to ever wear the uniform. Orioles fans would be lucky to see another player as great or better on the team again. Any player, present or future, would have to be something really special to unseat Grich from where he is on this list.

Boston Red SoxDavid Ortiz, Mike Napoli, Jonny Gomes, Daniel NavaLet\xe2\x80\x99s face it, if the Red Sox need a DH, Ortiz is likely to be that player.\xc2\xa0 As I write this, I think he just got another hit of the St. Louis Cardinals\xe2\x80\x99 pitching.\xc2\xa0 All kidding aside, his bat is too valuable not to have in the lineup, but he just can\xe2\x80\x99t play first base anymore, although the Red Sox do try to run him out there in interleague games, as they did in six games last year.\xc2\xa0 The 38-year-old is a nine-time All-Star and was a complete monster in both the World Series and the ALDS last year, winning World Series MVP honors. A lifetime .287 hitter, Ortiz has hit .309 or better in each of the last three seasons.\xc2\xa0 Factor in the 30 home runs, the 38 doubles for a guy with no speed, and Ortiz is still as formidable at the plate as ever.\xc2\xa0 He won\xe2\x80\x99t win points for his charm (just ask the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 visiting clubhouse phone, but Ortiz is a masher in the truest sense.Napoli and Nava are both expected to start at other positions, and let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget, this is Big Papi\xe2\x80\x99s position.2. New York YankeesAlfonso Soriano, Derek Jeter, Ichiro Suzuki, Mark TeixeiraThe Yankees DH situation could be a who\xe2\x80\x99s who of their aging veterans.\xc2\xa0 But it is Soriano who is expected to be the regular DH.\xc2\xa0 He provided a big boost once acquired by the Yankees last year, hitting 17 home runs in 58 games and driving in 50 runs.\xc2\xa0 Soriano no longer has the speed he once did, but is still a guy who can hit for over 30 doubles.\xc2\xa0 In fact, Soriano has 25 or more doubles in each of his 13 full seasons in the majors, to go a long with 20 plus homeruns in all but his first full season.\xc2\xa0 Soriano can still bring it with the bat, and so far his age has not caught up to him.\xc2\xa0 Never a big average guy, Soriano will be a key part in the Yankees veteran-laden lineup.\xc2\xa0 Jeter could play some DH in his last season so the Yankees can get him in the lineup, and Suzuki is expected to be a reserve as well.\xc2\xa0 But it is likely Soriano who will play here the most, as the Yankees want him in the lineup.3. Baltimore OriolesNelson Cruz, Delmon Young, Nolan Reimold, Henry Urrutia, Steve PearceNelson Cruz is expected to DH against righties and Delmon Young against lefties, at least preliminary based on comments from Buck Showalter.\xc2\xa0 Cruz is another player who can mash the ball, and will be a power threat in Camden Yards for sure.\xc2\xa0 I wrote extensively about him when talking about left field, to re-read that, click here. As for Delmon, his average numbers are similar to Ortiz, but he is nowhere near the power hitter than Ortiz is.\xc2\xa0 His numbers have been down the last three years, but Young is considered a bit of a good luck charm, as his team at the end of the season has made it to the playoffs each of the last five seasons.\xc2\xa0 If that isn\xe2\x80\x99t a reason for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to keep him, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is!Reimold is a guy who has some power, but he has to make the team first.\xc2\xa0 And if he does make the team, Urrutia and Pearce will not.4. Toronto Blue JaysAdam Lind, Edwin EncarnacionLind rebounded from three subpar seasons to have a pretty good year in 2013 as the regular DH for the Jays.\xc2\xa0 Occasionally he will spell Encarnacion at first base and Edwin will be the DH, but Lind is the primary DH in Toronto.\xc2\xa0 Lind offers a decent amount of power and is a solid option at DH for the Jays.\xc2\xa0 At 30 years old, nothing suggests his numbers would be declining, it is really about staying healthy for Lind.\xc2\xa0 That is a big part of the reasoning as to why he has moved to DH. One thing you will notice with Lind is he hits into a lot of double plays, which can be killer in the AL East.5. Tampa Bay RaysMatt Joyce, David DeJesus, Sean RodriguezI said when talking about Joyce as a reserve corner outfielder that the Rays expect big things from him this year. Joyce is a career .249 hitter, and only has one season, 2011, where he hit above .255.\xc2\xa0 In fact, in 2012 and 2013 he hit .241 and .235 respectively. That will not get it done from the DH, and is why the Rays are considering other options if he can\xe2\x80\x99t cut it.\xc2\xa0 Neither DeJesus nor Rodriguez would be prototypical DH options, and one of these three is going to start in LF.\xc2\xa0 One other possible option is Wilson Betemit, who is attempting to come back with the Rays this season.\xc2\xa0 However, the Rays have this position pretty much set, it is all about how well Joyce performs.

03/11/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Ranking the AL East Starting Pitchers', 'Jeff Curry-USA TODAY SportsThe starting rotations for each team at this point are starting to come into view.\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily what order the five players will pitch in, but certainly who those five players are likely to be. Now, a signing of Ervin Santana by one of the two teams in this division would change their rotation, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would change where either of them are ranked at this point. To start things off, the World Series champs. 1. Boston Red Sox Jon Lester, Clay Buchholz, Jake Peavy, John Lackey, Felix Doubront, Chris Capuano, Allen Webster These three combined for 52 wins last year for the Red Sox, and that was with Buchholz spending significant time injured and Peavy only pitching 64.2 innings for the Red Sox.\xc2\xa0 In looking at the main five listed, because barring injury that will be their rotation, you have four guys who are proven pitchers in the majors.\xc2\xa0 You know what you are going to get from each of them.\xc2\xa0 And a full season from a bulldog like Peavy, who will eat innings no matter how good his stuff is that night, and his stuff is usually pretty good.\xc2\xa0 Doubront, 26, has started 27 and 29 games the last two years, The one thing that jumps out at you is his WHIP near 1.5, but from a fifth starter in the AL East, you kind of learn to deal with that. If there would be an injury, free-agent signing Chris Capuano or Allen Webster would likely bump into the rotation, although both are certainly a step down from these five. 2. Tampa Bay Rays David Price, Matt Moore, Alex Cobb, Chris Archer, Jake Odorizzi, Jeremy Hellickson, Erik Bedard The young guns.\xc2\xa0 David Price is the elder statesman of this group, and he is 28.\xc2\xa0 The All-Star and Cy Young award winner (2012) is a career 71-39 in the majors.\xc2\xa0 With a WHIP under 1.2 for his career and an ERA of 3.19, Price is one of the best pitchers in the game.\xc2\xa0 These five amassed 47 wins in 2013, mainly due to Odorizzi not being in the majors.\xc2\xa0 And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a top year for them.\xc2\xa0 Price struggled with a lack of run support to his worst record of his career, Despite the fewest walk per nine innings and best strikeout to walk ratios of his career.\xc2\xa0 Moore, 24, was a sterling 17-4 last season.\xc2\xa0 Cobb, 26, was a fantastic 11-3 while missing considerable time after taking line drive off the head.\xc2\xa0 Archer, 25, finished third in the Rookie of the Year vote after going 9-7.\xc2\xa0 However, he also had to deal with a lack of run support, with a 3.22 ERA. Hellickson and Bedard are both proven pitchers in the majors, but Hellickson\xe2\x80\x99s struggles in 2013 have him currently without a spot in the rotation.\xc2\xa0 However, he could be the long man in the bullpen for the Rays. 3. Baltimore Orioles Chris Tillman, Ubaldo Jimenez, Wei-Yin Chen, Miguel Gonzalez, Bud Norris, Zach Britton, Kevin Gausman Some may say putting the Orioles ahead of the Yankees is a homer pick.\xc2\xa0 But not in my eyes.\xc2\xa0 Tillman, 25, went 16-7 last year, and several of his no-decisions were due to the bullpen blowing his games.\xc2\xa0 His starts weren\xe2\x80\x99t always pretty, as his ERA was 3.71 and there were a few games in which he struggled.\xc2\xa0 But, he pitched long enough to keep the team in it and let the offense win the game, something that likely won\xe2\x80\x99t be an issue this year.\xc2\xa0 Ubaldo is a welcome addition to the staff who was desperately in need of another top of the line starter.\xc2\xa0 It takes some of the pressure off of Chen, Gonzalez and Norris.\xc2\xa0 Chen needs to stay healthy, as the 28-year-old Taiwanese pitcher only appeared in 23 games last year.\xc2\xa0 However, Gonzalez is a sneaking good pitcher with really impressive numbers for a number 4.\xc2\xa0 As for Norris, many feel he may blossom under the tutelage of new pitching coach Dave Wallace.\xc2\xa0 Britton is out of options and could be the long reliever, while Gausman will likely go to AAA and start every day and beat on the door to the majors.\xc2\xa0 Both Britton and Gausman are having excellent springs for the Birds. 4. New York Yankees CC Sabathia, Hiroki Kuroda, Masahiro Tanaka, Michael Pineda, Ivan Nova, David Phelps, Vidal Nuno The questions abound with the Yankees pitching, and just like their lineup, a lot has to do with age.\xc2\xa0 The slimmed-down Sabathia, 33, has pitched over 200 innings each of the last 7 seasons, and some in baseball are beginning to wonder how much longer his arm will be as effective as it has been for so many years.\xc2\xa0 Kuroda is 39 years old, and is a career 69-70 pitcher.\xc2\xa0 Even last year he only went 11-13.\xc2\xa0 He isn\xe2\x80\x99t a big strikeout pitcher, and with some of the lineups in the division that can make it hard at times.\xc2\xa0 Tanaka got the huge contract from the Yankees, but is he another Yu Darvish?\xc2\xa0 No one knows, and no one will know until he pitches a few games.\xc2\xa0 Pineda hasn\xe2\x80\x99t pitched in the majors since 2011.\xc2\xa0 At only 25, he is still young enough to blossom with the potential he once had, but after major surgery it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a guarantee.\xc2\xa0 Nova went 9-6 last season in 23 games, but he had some real gems in there, including one against the Orioles.\xc2\xa0 Phelps and Nuno are both more likely to help a questionable bullpen than compete for a starting slot. 5. Toronto Blue Jays R.A. Dickey, Brandon Morrow, Mark Buehrle, J.A. Happ, Esmil Rogers, Ricky Romero, Drew Hutchison, Todd Redmond The Jays first four pitchers are pretty solid as far as making the rotation.\xc2\xa0 However, Dickey struggled last year in his first year with the team, going 14-13.\xc2\xa0 The knuckleballer is 39 years old, and the move to the AL East has not been as easy as it was pitching in the NL.\xc2\xa0 Buerhle is another veteran who has been successful, he went 12-10 last season and both guys had ERAs over 4.\xc2\xa0 Morrow is a guy with really good stuff, but can he put it all together?\xc2\xa0 He is 33-28 with the Jays over a four-year stretch, also with an ERA over 4.\xc2\xa0 Happ was another player who missed significant time after taking a line-drive to the head last year.\xc2\xa0 He is a sub .500 pitcher with a career ERA over 4.\xc2\xa0 And he is the Jays number 4, the 5 will be any of the above.\xc2\xa0 Or they could get Ervin Santana, but even with Santana, I still think their rotation is the worst in the AL East.

Though the acquisitions have bettered the team significantly and demonstrate their \xe2\x80\x9cwin now\xe2\x80\x9d mentality, the loss of early draft picks may interfere with the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 recent minor league revitalization. Not to say those costs outweigh the benefits, but it will prevent any additions of America\xe2\x80\x99s top undrafted talent. What are some ways this situation might be offset? International scouting may play a role in continuing to add cheap talent to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 minor league system.In just the past few years, the Orioles have signed Tsuyoshi Wada (Japan), Wei-Yin Chen (Taiwan), Koji Uehara (Japan), Henry Urrutia (Cuba), Miguel Gonzalez (Mexican League), and others. Though Wada never worked out for the Orioles, \xc2\xa0the other four have made contributions to the Orioles at one point or another. Urrutia had limited time at the Major League level, and Chen and Gonzalez are important parts of the starting rotation. Though Uehara is gone, he is not forgotten. Now the closer for the Boston Red Sox, Uehara was an important part of the Oroles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen when he was in Baltimore and brought back Chris Davis and Tommy Hunter in a trade with the Texas Rangers in 2011.Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThe previously listed players are just the tip of the iceberg for the Orioles when it comes to taking advantage of the international market. Among the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 list of top prospects are two more international signings of undrafted free agents. Eduardo Rodriguez (Venezuela) and Jonathan Schoop (Curacao) were added outside of the first year player draft and represent the importance of international scouting when building a farm system. What value they bring to the Major League level is yet to be determined, but they clearly have value (including trade value) that can be used to better the team one way or another.In 2014, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 will likely place a light emphasis on scouting players for the draft, considering the quality of players will fall off by the time the Orioles are on the board. With that said, it will be interesting to see how much emphasis they add to their international scouting. They won\xe2\x80\x99t have to invest excessive finances into scouting American players or paying huge signing bonuses to the players they sign. This money won\xe2\x80\x99t be pocketed, rest assured, but more likely redirected into international scouting.It will be very interesting to see what the Orioles do in their continued effort to build their minor league system through the international market. Orioles General Manager Dan Duquette has continued the emphasis on international scouting set by his predecessor, Andy McPhail, and has so far worked out well for Baltimore. International scouting may offer a cheaper and better means of adding talent to the Orioles, and it appears that it will be even more important in 2014. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
03/12/2014,"[('Top 40 Orioles of All Time: #9, Paul Blair - Camden Chat', "" #9 - Paul Blair - CF (1964-1976) To say that center fielder Paul Blair had a remarkable career is an understatement. In his career he played in six World Series, seven American League Championship series, won eight Gold Gloves, and played on just one team with a losing record in seventeen big league seasons. He is considered to be one of the greatest defensive players of all time, and according to Baseball Reference he played at an All-Star level in five different seasons while with the Baltimore Orioles. He was a premier player during the glory days in Baltimore.    Blair started his career in the New York Mets system, but came over to the Orioles prior to making his major-league debut at the age of 20 in 1964. He got just one plate appearance that season, but starting in 1965 was the regular center fielder for the Orioles. Blair wasn't a world class offensive player, but he more than held his own early in his career. In 1967 he had an OPS+ of 135, and in 1969 he slugged 26 home runs. He was just entering his prime when he was hit in the face by a pitch on May 31, 1970. He missed 17 games before coming back, and many say that he was never the same hitter after that. Blair himself blamed his offensive decline for not having Frank Robinson hitting behind him after 1971. I didn't have the good fortune of watching Paul Blair play defense, and I don't even have the luxury of looking up his advanced stats to try and paint a picture (back then they didn't, you know, exist). So instead of me trying and failing, here are some excerpts from a few guys who had a front row seat to Blair's defense.  Earl Weaver, from Weaver on Strategy:  Paul Blair could stand in center field and know when a ball was hit over his head. He would turn around and run, never looking back at the ball, get to a spot, and then look up -- and there would be the ball. He'd grab it easily. No one can explain what Paul Blair had that gave him the ability to run and run and then know exactly where the ball was coming down. That's something that can't be learned. Such players know where the ball is going long before it gets there. Watching them, it seems, it seems they know as soon as the ball leaves the bat. It can't be explained or taught.     Frank Robinson, via the Baltimore Sun:  [H]e was to the outfield what Brooks [Robinson] was to the infield. He was our glue out there. I had to play such a small area [in right field] just to get out of his way, and so did the left fielder, that it felt like we weren\xe2\x80\x99t even on the field.      I never saw Paul Blair run into a wall. He\xe2\x80\x99d go back to the wall, full speed, jump, come down with the ball, straight down, and he would never run into the wall. He knew where the wall was at all times. He played a very shallow center field. He was an outstanding center fielder. There were some times his throw wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as consistent as it should be, but he was a tremendous defensive center fielder.  Don Buford, via ESPN:  He played very shallow. People talked about how Willie Mays played shallow, and Paul did the same thing. He played with assuredness. With me in left and Frank Robinson in right, we played toward the lines and gave him a lot of room. He could really go get it.     Blair played in four World Series with the Orioles, and while he only had one hit in the 1966 WS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, it was a big one. In game three, the first home World Series game in Orioles history, Blair hit a solo home run off of Claude Osteen. It was one of only three hits the O's had in the game, and it was the only run the Orioles needed to win 1-0 and go up three games to none on the Dodgers. He was equally impressive in the 1970 World Series, going 9-for-22 with a .524 OBP against the Reds. All together, Blair played in 35 games for the Birds in postseason. Prior to the 1977 season, the Orioles traded Blair to the New York Yankees. His offense had fallen off the table by then, and he would never get it back. He did, however, get to play in two more World Series after being traded.    Paul Blair spent his post-baseball days living in the Baltimore area, and passed away on December 26, 2013 of a heart attack while attending a charity bowling event in Pikesville. He was elected into the Orioles Hall of Fame in 1984 and is, without a doubt, one of the greatest Orioles of all time.

Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsErvin Santana has signed with the Atlanta Braves for a reported $14.1 million \xe2\x80\x93 the exact amount of the qualifying offer. So, months of maneuvering finds Santana back at the starting point, financially speaking, although it could be argued that Atlanta is a better place to be than Kansas City. Yet again, the Royals are a pretty good-looking outfit, and they may in the end have the better season for all we know at this point.The Orioles were in the running for the last big free agent pitcher, having offered a one-year deal for $13 million, with talk also of three years for $30 million. The Braves have had a number of injuries that raise rotation concerns, so it made sense that this deal was consummated in that direction. One solace for the Orioles is that Santana did not end up with another suitor \xe2\x80\x93 the Blue Jays. But yet again, it could be that the Orioles would need help from the Jays this season to knock off other division rivals. So much speculation!Santana, like many other of the free agents this offseason, had hopes for a much better multi-year deal, but he wants to get into a camp and get the season going. The one-year deal allows him to play, again prove his worth, and gain a better deal moving forward.As with practically every pitcher, there are no real guarantees with Ervin Santana. Even if the Orioles would have been able to land him, would they be getting the guy from 2012 with a 5.16 ERA with the Angels, or the 3.24 ERA with the Royals in 2013? How much did the expanse of Kauffman Stadium help those numbers? Or could one expect something more like his career ERA of 4.19, which might not be worth really big bucks?The big difference between his poor 2012 season and other years is seen in one statistic \xe2\x80\x93 the number of home runs allowed \xe2\x80\x93 39, as compared to no more than 26 in all other campaigns.

He\xe2\x80\x99s not a fly-ball pitcher to the extent he is being portrayed by some.\xe2\x80\x9dOn an additional note, it is simply amazing to see the change in the Orioles organization\xe2\x80\x99s spending posture over the past month. Looking around at articles written by colleagues for other organizations that chose not to spend on Santana \xe2\x80\x93 clubs who could have arguably needed him even more than the Birds \xe2\x80\x93 there is anger, angst, and frustration pouring out all over the page.Looking back at my previous posts in the offseason, I wrote this\xc2\xa0at the time when the payroll was at about $83 million\xe2\x80\xa6Logical Conclusion = If the Orioles use their $17 million to yet acquire another quality pitcher or two, and do so in a way that gains the most bang for the buck, fans are not justified in criticizing the efforts made \xe2\x80\xa6 recognizing that the core of the team is as good as anyone else out there. BUT, if nothing more is done, after all the talk of a reasonable $100 million target as the \xe2\x80\x9creallocation of resources,\xe2\x80\x9d then the fan base has a justifiable right to feel blown off.According to the salary totals at the site \xe2\x80\x9cSpotrac\xe2\x80\x9d (here), the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 salary total right now is at $106.63 million.

Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY SportsThis past Friday, Ubaldo Jimenez threw two perfect innings against the Phillies, while A.J. Burnett got tagged for six runs on seven hits in his three innings against the Baltimore Orioles.But Wednesday saw a total reversal in fortunes. It was Jimenez who struggled from the start, giving up four runs in two innings \xe2\x80\x93 three of them in the top of the first on 37 pitches. Burnett was far from lights out, but he only gave up three hits in the first four innings before starting the fifth by allowing a walk and homer.Jimenez spoke of the newness of pitching from the stretch as the basis for his struggles. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a tough day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first time I got to pitch from the stretch in a game and it got the best of me. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a good release. That was after the leadoff guy got on base right away, so it was a little bit tough to get in a good rhythm.\xe2\x80\x9dAnother reversal in fortune was seen with Nolan Reimold. Serving as the DH, Reimold was two for three, including the two-run homer in the fifth off Burnett. He also hit a screaming line-drive that was turned into a double play.Showalter said of Reimold, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the breaking-ball base hit over at Pirate City, he\xe2\x80\x99s looking more \xe2\x80\x9chitterish\xe2\x80\x9d each at-bat, so that\xe2\x80\x99s good to see. I thought he had a lot of good at-bats today. He squared up a couple. I thought the line drive to third base was a better at-bat than the home run.\xe2\x80\x9dThere was originally a plan to send Reimold to the minor league camp in order to DH and get a higher number of at-bats under his belt, as the left fielder continues to get his muscle memory and timing back together since his multiple health adventures. That will likely happen today instead.Reimold is surely both on the clock and on the bubble. Time is running out for a decision that will impact him and the Orioles \xe2\x80\xa6 and some others as well in the logjam that is the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 options for the outfield. Speaking of options, Reimold is out of them; and he would not likely clear waivers if DFA-ed. The others immediately impacted by this conundrum are Delmon Young and Quintin Berry. Only two of the three can be kept along with Adam Jones, Nick Markakis, Nelson Cruz and David Lough.Prior to yesterday, Reimold was merely 3 for 14, with two of those hits being of the infield variety. Nolan needs to keep stroking the ball. There are not many guys with 30+ HR potential who can run like this guy, but \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa6 Everyone who follows the Orioles knows the rest of the sentence that comes after the \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9dIf I had one wish to be granted for one player, I would use it for Nolan. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t see the at-bats available for him to succeed in Baltimore, and I believe he is one who needs to play daily, including in the field, to be at the top of his game. It pains me to write that and face what looks to be his reality, as I have often been one of the last people on the bus with him and still identified as in his corner.Steve Johnson had two good innings with only one hit allowed. This spring he has had three good outings in his four appearances. In seven total innings he has only thrown 44 pitches, with 36 being strikes. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be great to have that sort of pitch count from Orioles starters? But with the number of options the O\xe2\x80\x99s have among pitchers, and with Johnson having an option, he will surely be starting for the Tides at this time next month.Eduardo Rodriguez pitched another couple of difficult innings in his last experience-gaining appearance before being sent to the minor league camp. He will likely be spending at least the first portion of the season with my pitching coach friend Blaine Beatty in Bowie. And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve written previously, this may be a good place for his baseball idol and fellow countryman Johan Santana to work back into form.Also assigned to minor league camp were Brock Huntzinger and Ivan De Jesus. All the cuts and assignments so far have been simple ones to make. More difficult decisions are coming just down the road, which is why unusual numbers of scouts are at all Orioles games like vultures circling overhead.

We talked about a wide array of subjects, including the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 issues with physicals over the off season, Ubaldo Jimenez and Nelson Cruz, and we even touched a bit on Brian Roberts. However towards the end of the program Ricky asked me if I thought the Orioles would outdo what the early Vegas odds said they would put up in terms of wins in 2014\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and my answer was a resounding\xc2\xa0YES. One of the early lines in Vegas predicted the BaltimoreCourtesy of Brace Hemmelgarn-USA TODAY SportsOrioles as finishing with 80.5 wins. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen another betting line that suggested 76.5 wins. First off (as I said on the program), what\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0half a victory? Is that what\xe2\x80\x99s scored in the standings if you sweep a doubleheader, even though they don\xe2\x80\x99t schedule doubleheaders anymore?! However that aside, both the 80 and 76 win total numbers seem to indicate that Vegas is buying into the whole\xc2\xa0anything that can go wrong for the Orioles will find a way to go wrong. Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, nothing is out of the realm of possibility. Injuries happen, such as Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x98 turned ankle the other day. However I can\xe2\x80\x99t validate odds that are saying that a core group of guys that won 93 games two years ago and 85 games last year is going to regress that much.To further this point, they had Toronto winning 86.5 games. Toronto supposedly won the off season last year, but yet they vastly underachieved and only posted 74 wins. So\xe2\x80\xa6after an off season that was vastly quiet north of the border they\xe2\x80\x99re going to win 12 more games year-over-year while the O\xe2\x80\x99s are going to flail in the wind. At least that\xe2\x80\x99s what Vegas is saying.Luckily, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a betting man and I don\xe2\x80\x99t place bets. However as I said on the podcast last night I see the Orioles finishing well north of 80.5 wins. Now in fairness the Birds do have supposedly the toughest schedule in baseball, however in effect they play the same schedule as the rest of the AL East. Incidentally, they\xe2\x80\x99re also putting the defending champions (Boston) at 79 wins, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t get. Time will ultimately tell one way or the other; it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible that in October we\xe2\x80\x99ll be saying that Vegas was right. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the season shaking down that way for the Orioles, and it seems that most of the folks on ESPN, MLB Network, et al. feel the same way.Speaking of wins and losses, I\xe2\x80\x99ll publish the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d season preview for the 2014 Orioles on Sunday March 30th.

', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Ranking the Closers and Relievers', 'Rob Grabowski-USA TODAY SportsWhen looking at relief pitchers and closers, there is a lot more than what meets the eye.\xc2\xa0 The Orioles bullpen is a perfect example.\xc2\xa0 2012, they were one of the best in MLB history, with the statistic from one-run games to back that up.In 2013, they led the majors in blown saves, which is one of the reasons why former closer Jim Johnson is now in Oakland.\xc2\xa0 The rest of the bullpen was kind of shaky as well.\xc2\xa0 And such is life in the bullpen.\xc2\xa0 Unless your name is Mariano Rivera, who of course is now retired, consistency doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always occur.Because of that, ranking the bullpen and closers is mainly going to focus on the closer spot.\xc2\xa0 However, I will briefly touch on the depth of the bullpen, especially if I feel two teams closer situation is near equal.Speaking of closers, there is only one closer in the AL East for 2014 who spent the entire season in 2013 as the closer.\xc2\xa0 So there has certainly been a lot of turnover at the position. But he won\xe2\x80\x99t rank number one in this list.1. Boston Red SoxKoji Uehara (CL), Edward Mujica, Craig Breslow, Junichi Tazawa, Brandon Workman, Andrew MillerThe Red Sox have the best closer in the division.\xc2\xa0 Koji is a pitcher who works fast, does not leave up many home runs and rarely walks anyone.\xc2\xa0 He is a guy who does not get fans anxious when he comes into the game to close.\xc2\xa0 His insanely good 1.09 ERA of 2013 and WHIP of 0.565 will not be duplicated, but Koji is a very good pitcher over his five years in the Majors.\xc2\xa0 A career 2.42 pitcher with a low WHIP of .829, he could end up one of the best closers in the league.\xc2\xa0 The one question the Red Sox must deal with is how often he can pitch.\xc2\xa0 He is a guy who had a few stamina issues back when he was for Baltimore, so it will be worth keeping an eye on.\xc2\xa0 But if can\xe2\x80\x99t close, Mujica is a very skilled candidate after last year filling in at closer for the St. Louis Cardinals, and there are several other guys in the bullpen who have been there for quite awhile.2. Toronto Blue JaysCasey Janssen (CL), Steve Delabar, Sergio Santos, Dustin McGowan, Aaron Loup, Brett CecilIf you were grading an entire bullpen, the Jays would be right up there with Boston.\xc2\xa0 Delabar was an All-Star last year despite being a 7th-inning reliever.\xc2\xa0 Janssen was firmly entrenched as the Jays closer last year, and did quite a good job, racking up a 4-1 record with 34 saves.\xc2\xa0 Janssen is not a strike out pitcher, but he also does not leave up many hits, leaving up 39 in 52.2 innings in 2013.\xc2\xa0 He has had a WHIP under 1 for the last two years, and is a very solid option at closer for Toronto.3. Tampa Bay RaysGrant Balfour (CL), Heath Bell, Jake McGee, Joel Peralta, Cesar Ramos, Alex Colome, Juan OviedoGrant Balfour\xe2\x80\xa6thought to be an Oriole, now back as a Ray.\xc2\xa0 The flamboyant former Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s closer has spent less than two full seasons as a closer, something he has in common with Janssen, which gives him more closing experience than Uehara.\xc2\xa0 Balfour was an All-Star last year for Oakland, going 1-3 with 38 saves and a 2.59 ERA and a WHIP of 1.159.\xc2\xa0 Look at the numbers, his numbers are no better than Janssen\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 And I think he is due regression, because I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe he is only going to get better at age 36.\xc2\xa0 And the rest of the Rays bullpen, there are certainly a lot of question marks.\xc2\xa0 Which Heath Bell are you getting, the one who was an All-Star closer three years ago, or the one who has struggled mightily the past two years.\xc2\xa0 And McGee\xe2\x80\x99s numbers aren\xe2\x80\x99t horrible, but I always remember the Orioles destroying him about every time they face them.4. Baltimore OriolesTommy Hunter (CL), Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Ryan Webb, Brian Matusz, Troy Patton, Evan Meek, Zach BrittonThe Orioles bullpen I would stack up against any other in the AL East because of their depth.\xc2\xa0 O\xe2\x80\x99Day has been a set-up man for a few years now.\xc2\xa0 Webb was a very good reliever for the awful Marlins, and Matusz gets lefties out with the best of them, as he just struck out David Ortiz again.\xc2\xa0 However, Patton will start the season on the restricted list, former All-Star Meek is trying to regain major-league form, and Tommy Hunter only has four saves in his career.\xc2\xa0 And because of that, they end up fourth on the list. The converted starter, Hunter closed four games last year during Jim Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s struggles.\xc2\xa0 As a reliever he can blow his fastball by hitters at 98 or 99 MPH, but the big concern is his issues leaving up home runs.\xc2\xa0 The numbers are skewed a bit because of his starter past, but Hunter leaves up a lot of home runs, something you can\xe2\x80\x99t do as a closer in a one-run game.\xc2\xa0 But, the Orioles hope that he can keep the ball down, and he will be their primary closer, although Buck Showalter may also look at matchups as well.5. New York YankeesDavid Robertson (CL), Shawn Kelley, Preston Claiborne, Dellin Betances, Matt Thornton, Adam WarrenDavid Robertson has big shoes to fill, probably the biggest a reliever has ever had to fill.\xc2\xa0 That alone is a lot of pressure.\xc2\xa0 And Robertson is a very good pitcher, but he only has 8 career saves himself.\xc2\xa0 Robertson gets a lot of strike outs, but also leaves up a large number of walks for a reliever.\xc2\xa0 With a career .276 ERA, he should be fine as a closer.\xc2\xa0 My concern isn\xe2\x80\x99t about him. How in the world are the Yankees going to get the ball to him with the relievers in front of him? Yes, Betances has been very good this spring.\xc2\xa0 But none of those names is striking fear into anyone.\xc2\xa0 The Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen has been a strength for so long, but this year it could be a glaring weakness.To check out all the previous rankings, click on the positions: Starting Pitching, Designated Hitter, Right Field, Center Field, Left Field, Third Base, Short Stop, Second Base, First Base, Catcher ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles @ Yankees spring training game thread, 1:05pm ...', "" You know it's a special day when Caleb Joseph is in an Orioles starting lineup. Sure, it's March 13 and it's a road game, plus there's the fact that Matt Wieters rolled his ankle and is out of action, so people are moved up the chart a little bit. He's like the forgotten guy. Hitting pretty well in Double-A and yet still with all the junk catchers they had in Norfolk, he couldn't move up. That probably means he isn't very good at catching, but hey. Maybe the Orioles just hate him for no reason.    Do you think a starting lineup containing Steve Pearce, Ryan Flaherty, and Henry Urrutia will be enough to forestall complaints about a team not sending enough major leaguers on a road trip? There's also starting pitcher Bud Norris. Those are some qualified major leaguers, but only one of the position players is likely to log significant time in the regular season, though the other two should at least spend time on the team. The only reason I'm asking is because this is the sort of thing the Marlins complained about with the Red Sox recently. But it doesn't seem like many teams are going to kick that hornet's nest in spring training, even if someone is technically violating an informal or formal rule. Other pitchers who've made the trip, according to Roch, are Kevin Gausman, Josh Stinson, Brad Brach, Ryan Webb, and Troy Patton. Well, that doesn't look as bad when you count the pitchers. At least three or four of them plus Norris figure to log significant time in the big leagues.    Thursday's game will be televised, marking a distinct difference from the revolution. However, it will be televised only on the YES Network, so you'd better fire up your MLB.tv if you want to watch any of it, like the radar gun on Michael Pineda, just in case you're curious how he's coming back from his shoulder issues.

03/14/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Projecting the AL East', 'Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsNow that all of my position rankings are done, I wanted to do a brief recap of where I feel that puts each team.\xc2\xa0 So I added up the team\xe2\x80\x99s points (5 for top player at that position to 1 for worst at that position) to determine which team rankings wise is best.The answer is not a surprise to me, the Baltimore Orioles.\xc2\xa0 They rank with 39 points, Boston 35, New York 34, Toronto 29, and Tampa Bay 28. So why do the rankings look like this?Well, the Orioles have more proven players on their roster who are not in the twilight of their career than anyone else.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, the Yankees have a ton of talent if everyone was in their prime and not a concern to be injured, they would have an All-Star team.\xc2\xa0 But many of those players are older than 35 and/or have significant injury concerns.\xc2\xa0 The oldest player on Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s roster is Nick Markakis, who may be a little past his prime, but not as much as say Brian Roberts.The Red Sox got the lowest ranking at two positions where they could end up being the best, SS and CF.\xc2\xa0 That is because they are starting two heralded rookies at those positions.\xc2\xa0 Right now, no one has a great idea what to expect, but both players are supposed to be very good.The Rays come in last because other than Evan Longoria, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have any established stars.\xc2\xa0 Wil Myers could be one, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had enough time to prove himself yet.\xc2\xa0 The Rays are a team that overachieves almost each and every season, a tribute to their great manager, Joe Maddon who is one of the best in the game (and the best in the division.)And the pitching, starting pitching only counted as one slot, but it is what sets teams apart.\xc2\xa0 The Red Sox and Rays lead in that area, which gives both teams a boost.Without further ado, here are my projections for the 2014 season:Boston Red Sox93-69, 1st placeI expect the defending champions to finish first again this year.\xc2\xa0 They have the best overall pitching in all of baseball, including starters who are all established major league pitchers.\xc2\xa0 They have great hitters, who should be able to make up for the struggles that several new additions may have at times.\xc2\xa0 You do have to be a little concerned about what performance they will get out of A.J. Pierzinski and whether they can keep a few of their players, namely Shane Victorino and Mike Napoli, healthy.\xc2\xa0 But overall there is no reason the champs shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t win the division again.Baltimore Orioles89-73, 2nd place and first wild cardThe Orioles are absolutely loaded on offense, where they likely will be better statistically than they were last year.\xc2\xa0 But it is all about pitching.\xc2\xa0 Which Ubaldo Jimenez are they getting, the one from the beginning of 2013 or the end?\xc2\xa0 Will Wei-Yin Chen and Miguel Gonzalez stay healthy?\xc2\xa0 If not, will Zach Britton finally put it all together.\xc2\xa0 If the pitching in Baltimore is good, or even just average, the Orioles will contend all the way up to the end of the season for the division title.\xc2\xa0 And the Orioles still have some potential trade chips as well, so there is still a chance they aren\xe2\x80\x99t done upgrading their team.Tampa Bay Rays85-77, 3rd placeThe Rays are seemingly in contention every single season.\xc2\xa0 Yet this year will be tough as the division is once again going to be very strong, meaning the competition in division will likely prevent the third place team from winning the second wild card spot. Manager Joe Maddon gets the best out of his players, and his pitching staff is locked and loaded with young talent.\xc2\xa0 The bullpen has a few questions, but most of the focus will be on how well the Rays hit the ball this year.\xc2\xa0 If well, this team will also be in contention all season.New York Yankees81-81, 4th placeThe Yankees are going to suffer through a disappointing season in the Bronx, yet still finish at .500.\xc2\xa0 There are just so many questions among the entire team, and so many health risks and aging players that is hard to see this team holding up over a 162 game season.\xc2\xa0 And if they all do stay relatively healthy, what performance will we see from Derek Jeter, Carlos Beltran, Alfonso Soriano, Mark Teixiera, Brian Roberts, and Kelly Johnson? That is six of the nine players projected to be opening day starters that there are questions about.\xc2\xa0 And that is before you get to the pitching, where you have to wonder about all the innings on CC Sabathia, Hiroki Kuroda\xe2\x80\x99s age, how good Masahiro Tanaka will be, and how good Michael Pineda will be pitching in the majors for the first time since 2011.\xc2\xa0 And can the bullpen full of players most have never heard of bridge that gap to closer David Robertson? So many questions for the Yankees.\xc2\xa0 They could get lucky and everyone stay healthy, but Brian Cashman thinks that fluke seasons don\xe2\x80\x99t just happen.\xc2\xa0 If that is the case, his team is a sinking ship this year with the various questions.Toronto Blue Jays77-85, 5th placeNotice, Jays aren\xe2\x80\x99t that far below .500.\xc2\xa0 They have some good pieces, but once again the pitching staff is a huge question mark.\xc2\xa0 Even though he is a knuckleballer, their staff ace R.A. Dickey is 39, which is pretty advanced in baseball age. Plus, he had a subpar season last year in the AL East.\xc2\xa0 How good will Mark Buerhle be, and J.A. Happ?\xc2\xa0 As for the hitters, if everyone had career seasons at once, like what happened two years ago, the Jays could be very competitive.\xc2\xa0 But the lineup is made up of guys who are largely inconsistent, and that isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that just magically changes.\xc2\xa0 I think the Jays are looking at another last place in the AL East this season.How would you rank the teams?\xc2\xa0 Do you think Boston will repeat as division champions?\xc2\xa0 Will the Yankees be able to stay healthy and finish higher?\xc2\xa0 Comment and let me know!To see my rankings on each positions: Relief Pitchers and Closer, Starting Pitchers, Designated Hitter, Right Field, Center Field, Left Field, Third Base, Short Stop, Second Base, First Base, Catcher ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Yankees\\u2019 Pineda Makes Impression Against Orioles - The \\u2026', ""     Supported by    Baseball  Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 Pineda Makes Impression Against Orioles  By PETER KERASOTISMARCH 13, 2014    Continue reading the main story Share This Page  Continue reading the main story                if (             window.magnum             && window.magnum.getFlags().indexOf('headlineBalancer') > 0             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.shouldRun()         ) {             window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize();         }        After another strong performance, the Yankees continued to be optimistic about Michael Pineda.Against the Baltimore Orioles in Tampa, Fla., Pineda pitched two and two-thirds innings, yielding three hits and a walk and striking out five.

"", 'www.nytimes.com'), ('Top 40 Orioles of All Time: #8, Mark Belanger - Camden Chat', ' #8 - Mark Belanger, SS (1965-1981) It\'s safe to say that Mark Belanger never won a Gold Glove because he had a great year at the plate. He won eight of them in an eighteen-year career, thirteen of which he spent as a full-time player. Belanger won a Gold Glove in more than half of the seasons in which he played over 100 games.    He did all of this with a career batting line of .228/.300/.280, pulling off that impressive feat of having a slugging percentage below his OBP. A player might do this over the span of a season or two nowadays before they wash out. Belanger had 6,601 plate appearances in his big league career. If batting .200 is the Mendoza Line, perhaps having an on-base percentage of .300 should be the Belanger Line. Belanger was a league-average hitter (by OPS+ of at least 100) exactly one time, in 1976, when his batting line rose to a scorching .270/.336/.326. None of that really mattered, because he wasn\'t playing for his bat. When up-and-coming manager Earl Weaver first encountered Belanger in the minor leagues, he said, ""You\'re my shortstop if you hit .0001."" He was safe in that regard, though there were two seasons where his batting average was below .200. In 1970, he even ""won"" a Triple Crown, if only they were scored like in golf - his batting average, home runs, and RBI were all lowest in the American League among qualified batters. More than just about any of the other of our Top 40 Orioles who I never saw play, I wish I could have seen Belanger in action. I\'ve heard enough stories from my dad about him and I would love to have been able to see it for myself. What must it have been like for hitters trying to get balls on the ground past the tandem of Belanger and Brooks Robinson? If Belanger had been able to hit close to as well as Brooks, he\'d probably be in the Hall of Fame, too.    Instead, he\'s remembered as a defensive wizard, as well he should be. He was worth 41 Wins Above Replacement in his career, according to Baseball Reference. That\'s sixth-most in the history of the franchise. 39.3 of those wins were for his defense, which leaves him ahead of even legends like Brooks and Cal Ripken.    It\'s tough to imagine someone in today\'s game being so good defensively that they would warrant playing time for so long in spite of that kind of batting line. Maybe it was a stretch even in his era, but he had the loyalty of Weaver for a long time, and he rewarded Weaver for sticking with him over a long career. When Orioles pitchers were dazzling the league, Belanger played an important part. As poor as he was at the plate, he still had a couple of pitchers to face who he hit better than others. Two of these happened to be future Hall of Famers Bert Blyleven and Nolan Ryan. What was it about Blyleven that Belanger could solve him to the tune of a .321/.406/.375 batting line in 64 plate appearances? Or Ryan, the man with seven no-hitters, letting Belanger get on base at a .367 clip in 62 plate appearances in his career? Some things are not meant for mortal minds to know.    The Blade - so-called because he was so skinny, that\'s what he looked like in profile - played in the third-most games in Orioles history, with 1,962 games played. Though he wasn\'t known for hitting, his 1,304 career hits are 12th-most in O\'s history, with 33 triples being eighth-highest. He walked a little, enough that his 571 walks also place in eighth, and when he got on, he might steal a base: 166 career steals leave him in fifth, tied with the man he replaced at shortstop, Luis Aparicio. Weaver always said the place for a sacrifice bunt was deep in your closet, but when Belanger came up to the plate, it was time to go digging for it. One place where he leads the franchise is in sac bunts, with 153. He was the exception to that rule. His eight Gold Gloves and legendary defense will forever be a part of the annals of the franchise. He\'s an important part of every Orioles home game to this day. The story goes that in 1975, it was Belanger and his wife who suggested that the team start using ""Thank God I\'m A Country Boy"" as the song during the seventh-inning stretch. Every time the Oriole Bird does his little hoedown on the home dugout, the Blade\'s will is done.    Belanger was elected to the Orioles Hall of Fame in 1983, not even a full year after his playing career had ended. As with the other greats, there was no doubt from the beginning that he was one of the best to ever wear the uniform. He passed away in 1998 after a battle with lung cancer. Belanger is buried in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, the same town where he was once a two-sport star and where the Orioles found him as an amateur free agent back in 1962.

Absalon-USA TODAY Sportseyebrow or two. You\xe2\x80\x99ll remember that Balfour ceremoniously had his would-be contract pulled by the Orioles earlier this year after medical issues were raised on his physical. To their credit, the O\xe2\x80\x99s never spoke publically about the circumstance, although Dr. Koko Eaton (Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s physician) took up for Balfour saying that he was healthy. The story grew legs of it\xe2\x80\x99s own, and it ended up painting the Orioles organization in somewhat of a poor light.So I have to wonder if this latest news doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make the likes of Dan Duquette feel somewhat vindicated. Obviously the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t wish ill upon a player, however the organization was steadfast in it\xe2\x80\x99s belief that Balfour\xe2\x80\x99s health wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t last for the duration of the contract. It seemed that most of the public opinion about the matter was slanted in Balfour\xe2\x80\x99s direction \xe2\x80\x93 outside of Baltimore that is.If the Orioles are smart, they\xe2\x80\x99ll concentrate on their own camp and not worry about Balfour.

Steinbrenner Field. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsAny of you who have ever managed a stock portfolio know that it is a difficult process, and even on the best days there are a few investments going in the wrong direction.That is something of an illustration as to how spring training is for a baseball team. It is evaluating what investments (and literally, players are investments) are ready to be cashed in by the organization in terms of making the final 25-man roster.Every Baltimore Orioles fan can name a list of the 17-18 players who are \xe2\x80\x9clocks\xe2\x80\x9d to be on the roster. But filling the remaining handful of positions is more complicated this year than any other season in recent memory. Adding to the complication are some temporary setbacks that likely make Manny Machado unavailable for opening day.Relative to the players who are somewhat on the bubble, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at whose stock is rising or falling right now \xe2\x80\xa6Rising Stock ValueJonathan Schoop \xe2\x80\x93 The second baseman looks like the second coming of Machado. After a mediocre season with some health issues in 2013, and then a very lackluster Arizona Fall League performance, I am totally surprised at how well he has performed in spring training. Much of this is due to the obvious benefits of a workout regimen that has reshaped him into an athletic specimen. If it were up to the fanbase, Schoop would be playing second base now.Steve Clevenger \xe2\x80\x93 The local boy is ripping the ball with a 9 for 19 / .474 average. That\xe2\x80\x99s more than enough to make us all forget Taylor Teagarden, and he would seem a no-brainer for the open role of backup catcher. But Johnny Monell is playing nearly as well.Alex Gonzalez \xe2\x80\x93 The long-time veteran looks to have plenty of quality baseball in him, both in the field and while currently hitting 10 for 23.Steve Pearce \xe2\x80\x93 No doubt, when Pearce squares a ball, it is hit with authority. He is currently 9 for 36 with the most at bats on the Orioles. Unlike the other outfield candidates, he can play 1B. Buck loves him \xe2\x80\xa6 always calls him a \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional hitter.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Hear me, there are many players who are far worse. I\xe2\x80\x99m just not a fan \xe2\x80\xa6 just don\xe2\x80\x99t think he is an athlete with the upside potential of anyone else vying for the extra OF positions. Even so, I\xe2\x80\x99d not be surprised to see the Orioles keep him, though I believe that would be a mistake.Eddie Gamboa \xe2\x80\x93 He is not going to be on the final 25-man roster, and has already been sent down. But the knuckleball experiment is bearing fruit.Josh Stinson \xe2\x80\x93 Out of options and pitching well, he\xe2\x80\x99ll make the team for opening day this year.Brian Matusz \xe2\x80\x93 Out of options and pitching well, he\xe2\x80\x99ll make the team for opening day this year.Steve Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 Not out of options and pitching well, he won\xe2\x80\x99t make the team for opening day this year.Kevin Gausman \xe2\x80\x93 see Steve Johnson.Zach Britton \xe2\x80\x93 As I wrote in a piece yesterday, Britton is currently pitching as well as he ever has \xe2\x80\x93 touching 96 and 97 with his fastball \xe2\x80\x93 from a lefty! And his off-speed and breaking pitches look deadly. It would be a shame to lose him at the very moment he may well be ready to truly excel. I think he has to be kept, and I would not be surprised to see him as a starter at some point this year.Falling Stock ValueAlexi Casilla \xe2\x80\x93 He is finally starting a game today, but has had one injury after another. I know he is a great clubhouse guy that Buck likes, but there are simply more and better options.Jamile Weeks \xe2\x80\x93 There is no doubt that Weeks can really run. However he is not hitting for much at the moment, and having an option, it will likely be used.Delmon Young \xe2\x80\x93 Though Young delivered two hits yesterday including a double that turned into the winning run, overall he has not produced the sort of spring that cries out for a definitive place on the roster.Alfredo Aceves \xe2\x80\x93 He has given up five runs on seven hits in five innings. He does not seem to be fooling anyone, though Buck speaks well of his long-term record.Troy Patton \xe2\x80\x93 With the 25-game suspension, Patton is not getting much of a look this spring, and when he has pitched, it has been ugly. I have the sense that the Orioles are disgusted with him, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll predict he never pitches again for the Birds. But that is total conjecture.Uncertain DirectionDavid Lough \xe2\x80\x93 Lough has demonstrated the hustle and all-out aggressive style that marks his approach to the game, and perhaps that has caused him to have some current issues with neck problems from diving for balls. He might be a bit like Bryce Harper in terms of how his style is going to lead to some occasional bangs and bruises. He is currently 6 for 23 with two triples and two stolen bases. If healthy, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in LF for the Baltimore Orioles.Nolan Reimold \xe2\x80\x93 It really is make-or-break / do-or-die time with Nolan. He is only batting 5 for 20, but has six walks for a good OBP. The Orioles are doing all they can to give him sufficient at bats to regain his form. Will it be enough? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to think on this one. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine being an Orioles writer without having Reimold around to talk about.Henry Urrutia \xe2\x80\x93 The guy can hit, but he has demonstrated the base running blunders he is known to sadly still possess, though his fielding is better. Since his position is already crowded, and since he can be optioned, and since he needs some more tuning on defense and the bases, he will be sent to AAA. However, I cannot imagine but that he will totally tear up the International League with his bat. How long can he be denied?Quintin Berry \xe2\x80\x93 Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 high school teammate and friend is 6 for 24, but has struck out seven times. He has many skills, but can he stick?Mid-March PredictionsI am not even going to try to figure out the LF and DH combo. I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it is Clevenger for backup catcher. And with Machado not likely being ready, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with Ryan Flaherty / Schoop / Gonzalez as covering 2B, 3B and backup infielder.Here\xe2\x80\x99s the pitching staff \xe2\x80\x93 The five well-known starters \xe2\x80\xa6 with the bullpen of Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Tommy Hunter, Brian Matusz, Ryan Webb, Zach Britton, Josh Stinson, and Kelvin De La Cruz (since he is out of options) or Evan Meek if he continues to pitch well. However, if Aceves looks good at all over the next two weeks, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be the final guy based upon his history.I know there are hundreds of readers out there.

But before we crown the Birds as a force in the AL East, let\xe2\x80\x99s recognize the fact that the majority of NY\xe2\x80\x99s regular players\xc2\xa0were in Panama playing exhibition games in honor of Mariano Rivera. The only New York players with whom anyone was familiar was Ichiro Suzuki, and\xe2\x80\xa6get this, Brian Roberts. However again, the most important part of any of these games is how they unfold \xe2\x80\x93 as opposed to the final scoreChris Tillman had what I would term his best outing of the spring thus far. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.0Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIP, 3 H, 1 R, 2 BB,\xc2\xa05 K. I say it\xe2\x80\x99s the best one because Tillman had posted a couple of laissez-faire outings in a row, and he really rebounded yesterday afternoon. Tillman used a heavy dose of fastballs to mow New York hitters down, but Francisco Arcia\xe2\x80\x98s solo homer on a fastball in the top of the sixth gave New York a 1-0 lead. However the fact that Tillman stayed in the game into the sixth inning is impressive in and of itself. He was lifted as soon as he gave up the homer, however that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take away from the effort he put forth and the quality outing he turned in. Zach Britton came in to relieve Tillman, and he posted a 97 MPH fastball for a strike on the gun.In the last of the sixth Chris Davis sent a two-out shot to center and suddenly the game was tied at one. An inning later in the last of the seventh, Delmon Young sent a tight grounder over the bag and down the line at third, which put him at second base. The Orioles pinch ran Jermile Weeks, who promptly attempted to steal third with Jonathan Schoop at the plate. Weeks had a decent jump as it was, but Schoop made a very smart play in offering up a bunt before hastily pulling the bat back. That movement distracted NY\xe2\x80\x99s catcher just enough to where he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to throw. Weeks took third base, and he would later score on Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly.Yesterday was also the debut of Suk-min Yoon, who gave up on hit on 11 pitches. Yoon was followed to the mound by Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, who pitched himself into a jam by allowing two runners to get into scoring position with nobody down. However O\xe2\x80\x99Day pitched out of the jam without allowing a run, and the Orioles completed their 2-1 victory over NY, the teams\xe2\x80\x99 final meeting in Grapefruit League play. On a side note, Matt Wieters sat out yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game with a sore ankle, and Adam Jones is expected to return to the team today or tomorrow following the birth of his son earlier this past week. The Orioles will travel to Dunedin, FL this afternoon at 1 PM to take on the Toronto Blue Jays.

Hardy is seen during batting practice before a spring exhibition baseball game against the New York Yankees in Sarasota, Fla., Saturday, March 15, 2014. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORESARASOTA, Fla. (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 There\'s a word to describe the way J.J. Hardy plays shortstop.It isn\'t ""flashy"" or ""colorful.""""His nickname here is Textbook,"" said Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter, who appreciates Hardy\'s defense far more than the bat that last year produced 25 home runs and earned the 31-year-old a Silver Slugger Award.Hardy doesn\'t often make the plays that show up on the nightly highlight show. That\'s not his style. But if the Orioles are lined up at double-play depth and Hardy gets his hands on a grounder, Baltimore will get those two outs quicker than you can say 6-4-3.He\'s all about substance.""I\'ve never been flashy,"" Hardy said. ""I feel like if I make an error trying to be flashy, I\'m about as embarrassed as I can possibly be.""It doesn\'t happen often. Hardy earned a second straight Gold Glove Award last season after ranking first among shortstops in double plays, second in assists and third in putouts. Over the past two years he\'s made only 18 errors in 1,424 chances.The last Orioles shortstop to win two consecutive Gold Glove Awards was Cal Ripken Jr. (1991-92). Ripken, a no-nonsense fielder, appreciates the way Hardy plays the position.""He does it without a lot of fanfare,"" Ripken said. ""He does it consistently. He makes all of the plays and is in the right spot all the time. And it doesn\'t going to go unnoticed to me.""Showalter can\'t help but notice, too.""If you\'re not talking about it, you\'re not watching. But I think a lot of people don\'t talk about it because he\'s not flashy,"" the manager said. ""He doesn\'t need to draw attention to himself by making something look harder than it is.""It\'s a lesson that is not wasted on Manny Machado, the Orioles\' 21-year-old third baseman. Machado was drafted as a shortstop, but he\'s learned plenty about the position by working alongside Hardy over the past two seasons.""I don\'t think there\'s anybody better out there,"" Machado said. ""Some of my success is because of my talent, but mentally he helped me out a lot, seeing how he goes about his business and seeing how he gets prepared for games. This game is all about routine, and to learn from a guy like that, it\'s something I\'ll always remember. It will always be a part of my game.""Hardy makes an error about as infrequently as a sports writer turns down a free meal. When it does happen, it\'s a shock.""When he kicks a ball,"" Showalter said, ""everybody just goes, \'What happened?\'""Everyone makes mistakes. Hardy, a two-time All-Star, does so less often than most.""I have to remind myself that errors are part of the game because it bothers me. I still get really upset,"" he said. ""It\'s a pride thing. I don\'t think I\'ll ever be OK with making an error.""OK, it\'s obvious Hardy cares about how he performs with the glove. But what about his bat? He\'s hit 30, 22 and 25 home runs over his last three seasons and totaled 224 RBIs over that span.""Defense is something I take a lot of pride in only because defense got me to the big leagues,"" Hardy said. ""In \'05 I wasn\'t much of a hitter, but they said if you can catch the ball and throw the ball, you\'ll play for us in the big leagues. That\'s what I did, and then I started to develop a little bit more, got a little bit stronger. I always take a lot of pride in defense, but it\'s about the same when it comes to offense.""After breaking into the big leagues with Milwaukee in 2005, Hardy played five seasons with the Brewers before being dealt to Minnesota in 2009. He was traded to the Orioles a year later, and has found a home in Baltimore.The three-year extension he signed in 2011 will expire after this season. Hardy wants to stay, and it\'s clear that the Orioles don\'t want to lose a shortstop with a steady glove and a potent bat.""We\'re really happy with the work he\'s done and we\'re going to try to get a long-term agreement with him,"" executive vice president Dan Duquette said this week.Hardy is taking a wait-and-see approach.""There has been not much talk at all,"" he said. ""I don\'t know what they\'re thinking. Really, the ball is in their court if they want me. They know I like it here.""If he is to stay, it will be as a shortstop. The Orioles moved Ripken to third base during the latter part of his career, and Hardy is not ready for that kind of switch.""If there are any intentions at all of signing me to a long-term deal and wanting Manny to move over to short I would definitely want to know that before,"" Hardy said. ""Because, yeah, I still feel like I can play shortstop and that is what I want to do.""CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

03/17/2014,"[('Top 40 Orioles of All Time: #7, Boog Powell - Camden Chat', "" #7 - Boog Powell, 1B/OF (1961-1974) When Camden Yards opened its doors in 1992, I was at the second game played there with my father and my brother. We walked along a packed Eutaw Street taking in the sights, and when my father saw Boog Powell standing at Boog's BBQ, we had to rush over and get in line. Boog greeted us warmly and signed my Camden Yards inaugural game program, and that was my first exposure to one of the greatest players in Orioles history.    It's funny how many years I felt familiar with Boog Powell because of how visible he is around the park, because until a few years ago I never had any idea how good of a baseball player he actually was. He stopped playing for the Orioles five years before I was born, so the only thing I really knew about him was that he was an old time Oriole and something of a giant. But man, he was good. After going 1-for-13 over the last five games of the 1961 season, Boog was up for good beginning in 1962. In 1963 he hit 25 home runs and 22 doubles for the Orioles with an OPS+ of 125, and he only got better from there. He broke out in 1964, hitting .290/.399/.606 with 39 home runs. From 1962-1965, Boog Powell played mostly left field for the Orioles. The O's had Jim Gentile playing first base in '62 and '63, then Norm Siebern (who the O's traded Gentile for) in '64 and '65. But after Siebern left the team, first base belonged to Boog Powell.    In 1966, which we all know as the year of the Orioles first World Series championship, Boog hit .287/.372/.532 with 34 home runs. He came in third place in the A.L. MVP race behind teammates Frank and Brooks Robinson and went 5-for-14 in the World Series against the Dodgers.    After being selected for the first of four consecutive All-Star Games in 1968, Boog again came close to the MVP in 1969. He slugged 37 home runs with a 160 OPS+ but came in second in voting to Harmon Killebrew. But finally, in 1970, he brought home the trophy. He hit 35 home runs with an on-base percentage of .412 that season. Boog Powell played in four World Series with the Orioles, but never was he more on fire in the playoffs than in 1970. In the ALCS with the Minnesota Twins (who didn't stand a chance, really, being swept in three games by a combined score of 27-10), Boog went 6-for-14 with six RBI. And in the World Series against the Reds, he had five hits and five walks in five games, with two home runs.    In 1973-74, Boog's power dropped and he found himself sharing time at first base with Earl Williams. He was still an above-average hitter, just not as good as he used to be. The Orioles traded him to the Cleveland Indians for two players who never contributed much on the field. Boog had a fantastic 1975 with the Indians but fell off the table after that. He retired in 1977 after being released by the Dodgers in August. Boog Powell was the kind of player that the word slugger was created for. He had four seasons with over 30 home runs. The only Oriole to do it more is Eddie Murray. His 303 home runs as an Oriole ranks third all time behind only Cal Ripken and Murray. But he wasn't just a power hitter, he was also patient. He had a career walk rate of 12.8% and from 1964-1974 he topped 15% four times. His 889 walks is third on the O's all-time list. His total hitting line as an Oriole was .266/.362/.465 (OPS+ 135). He was elected into the Orioles Hall of Fame in 1979. So there you have it. Boog Powell is not only a successful businessman and local celebrity who signs autographs while you wait for your pit beef sandwich. He is also the seventh best Oriole of all time.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThere is a famous John Kruk story that became the title line for a 1994 book by the former Phillies player and current ESPN baseball analyst. The Kruker tells it like this, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a story, a funny story, about me sitting in a restaurant. I\xe2\x80\x99m eating this big meal and maybe having a couple of beers and smoking a cigarette. A woman comes by the table. She recognizes me and she\xe2\x80\x99s shocked because it seems like I should be in training or something. She\xe2\x80\x99s getting all over me, saying that a professional athlete should take better care of himself. I lean back and I say to her, \xe2\x80\x98I ain\xe2\x80\x99t an athlete, lady. I\xe2\x80\x99m a baseball player.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9dThat was then, and this is now. And now, if you want to be a baseball player, you\xe2\x80\x99d better be an athlete too. Gone are the days when unique skills, eye-hand coordination, or whatever talent could sufficiently carry a person to a big league career. Without doubt, those unique abilities are necessary requisites to, for example, recognize and hit a rising 95-mph fastball. But minus a strong fitness component, those skills will now only take a player so far.Who is the most valuable person in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 organization? The first thought is to consider the great players \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Davis for his homers, Matt Wieters for his defense and influence on more than half of all plays in the game, or Adam Jones for his consistent play in both halves of an inning. Or you might think more widely and say that it is Buck Showalter who orchestrates all that happens in the game, or say that it has to be Dan Duquette who secures the talent to make it all possible.Right now, my vote is going to Brady Anderson for what he is accomplishing away from the field in terms of fitness, nutrition, and all that goes into making a baseball player more than just a baseball player \xe2\x80\xa6 in fact, an athlete.Think for a moment about the players in spring training who are getting some of the most attention for their play and their skills improvements. There is Zach Britton throwing 97 mph with the return of his killer sinker. Jonathan Schoop has Orioles Nation screaming to put him on second base NOW. Nick Markakis looks like a new person with a new body under the old head. The same with Henry Urrutia. And think back to the \xe2\x80\x9carrival\xe2\x80\x9d of Chris Tillman and his 25-10 record since his call-up at the second half of the 2012 season.What is the common denominator behind these stories and a list of others we could additionally cite? It is Brady Anderson and the conditioning program that he has installed as a normal part of the new culture of the Baltimore Orioles organization.\xc2\xa0 Some of the Orioles players have found quick success with this technique, whereas for others it is taking a bit longer to see the reward. But the payoff for more than a few is undeniable.You never hear Chris Tillman talk about his pitching metamorphosis without some credit being given to working with Brady Anderson. Zach Britton spent the offseason with Anderson in Southern California for the second consecutive year, and along with a healthy arm for the first time since 2011, the results look very promising. And Schoop was introduced to the program in the fall of 2012, after the Arizona Fall League concluded that year.Anderson has gone from a former player who helped some individual Orioles along the way with some fitness techniques, to now being an executive in the organization who manages such as a strength-and-conditioning component of all that is done. Along with the great new Sarasota facility of varied practice fields is also the best of equipment for \xe2\x80\x9cthe world according to Brady\xe2\x80\x9d to be accomplished. Previously for the spring season \xe2\x80\x93 and I\xe2\x80\x99m not making this up \xe2\x80\x93 the exercise and weight equipment was housed in a tent!Though it will not likely be rare for long, this culture of weight training and exercise science is far ahead of the game in MLB. In an article from a year ago by the Baltimore Orioles MLB writer Brittany Ghiroli, she related the comments of players coming to the Orioles from other franchises and reflecting upon their comparative experiences.Nate McLouth at that time said, \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people, in talking to guys from other teams, maybe had more of a conservative approach to lifting, especially during the season. Here, if you want to get after it, you can get after it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never lifted as heavy as I did last year during the season, and my legs have never felt as good.\xe2\x80\x9dAnd hear this from Chris Davis \xe2\x80\x93 and remember that this is BEFORE he hit the 53 homers, \xe2\x80\x9cIn Texas, there were maybe four or five guys always in the weight room. Here, there are like 20. One of the reasons I finished as strong as I did last year was the workouts. I came in with some [past] knee issues and was able to run around in the outfield and not have knee problems or anything like that.\xe2\x80\x9dSo, is it possible that the Baltimore Orioles having 20 more homers in 2013 than anyone else was simply the good fortune of just happening to have an unusual number of long-ball hitters on the roster at the same time? Or could it be also related to this sort of conditioning program and fitness culture?Some players, no matter how much they lift, are not going to be home run hitters. But others with the strength and ability to hit long fly balls could have their conditioning raised that fractional amount that helps some of those \xe2\x80\x9clong and loud outs\xe2\x80\x9d to fly just over the fence instead of into the outfielder\xe2\x80\x99s glove. And that is what many of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 homers are \xe2\x80\x93 long fly balls that make it over the fence, rather than screaming line-drives that are perfectly squared and hit precisely on the nose.Much is also written about the great clubhouse atmosphere that the Orioles have \xe2\x80\x93 that \xe2\x80\x9cband of brothers\xe2\x80\x9d culture of togetherness. I guarantee this is much accomplished, in part, through hours together in the weight room. I know this happens in the world of sports. I saw it in my final two years of high school coaching recently completed (distance runners) where my running guys bought into this and became best friends \xe2\x80\x93 and champions \xe2\x80\x93 together from hours of weight-and-strength-conditioning training beyond the hours of simply running. My own son from that group is now majoring in exercise science in college.Brian Matusz said of this fellowship component, \xe2\x80\x9cJust how the guys are \xe2\x80\x93 the camaraderie \xe2\x80\x93 after we are done on the field, everybody is in there working out together, pushing each other. It\xe2\x80\x99s got that fun atmosphere, where it\xe2\x80\x99s not, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, we have to go work out today.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x98All right, guys, here we go, this is fun.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9dAnd it is not just in Sarasota, or Baltimore, or Southern California with Brady. Anderson has helped a number of the players, including Nick Markakis, set up their own personal weight rooms with necessary equipment, etc.So, even though Chris Davis broke Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s single season Orioles home run record, Brady can rightly take some pleasure in having had a part in seeing it happen.

I apologize for the technical difficulties and for the rough nature of the show itself; all of that will\xc2\xa0improve as we go onward with this endeavor. But thanks goes out to all of our listeners and readers.The Baltimore Orioles played another pitchers duel yesterday, however this time they came upCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sportson the short end of a 4-3 decision in Dunedin, FL against Toronto. However the story of this game was the performance of starter Miguel Gonzalez, who said after the game that he was content with his performance. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4 IP, 5 H, 1 R, 0 BB, 3 K. So to review, the Orioles had presumed starter Chris Tillman with a quality outing on Saturday followed by presumed starter Miguel Gonzalez with a quality outing yesterday. (Note that I\xe2\x80\x99m using the term\xc2\xa0quality outing rather liberally; not in the true sense of the term.) If there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed this spring, it\xe2\x80\x99s that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 presumed starting rotation has looked very strong thus far.Of the players who started the game, Ryan Flaherty and Steve Clevenger both netted RBI, which gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 2-0 lead. However Toronto chipped away, and tied the game at two on Munenori Kawasaki\xe2\x80\x98s RBI in the last of the ninth. You might remember Kawasaki, who won a few games for Toronto last season in walk off fashion (one against the Orioles) and became noted for his celebrations. Nevertheless, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a bases-loaded situation in the last of the ninth yesterday, however Xavier Paul gunned the would-be winning run down at the plate to preserve the tie.Most spring training games are allowed to go into the 10th inning if they\xe2\x80\x99re tied (depending upon how many players the visiting team had brought with them). This one was no exception, and Daniel Alvarez gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a quick lead with a solo homer. At that point it was merely a matter of getting three outs, however Toronto had other ideas and were able to push two runs across in the last of the tenth to defeat the Orioles by the aforementioned 4-3 score.Again, the big takeaway here is Miguel Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s performance. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past that Gonzalez can be a workhorse, which bodes well for the Oriole team if he\xe2\x80\x99s stuck smack in the middle of the rotation. Adam Jones also made the trip from Sarasota, and got his first action in a week after returning from the birth of his son last week. Jones, who\xe2\x80\x99s only hitting .125 for the spring, went 1-for-2 with a walk. So should Orioles fans worry about Jones with only two weeks left in spring training? I would say no, given the fact that he progressed slowly during Grapefruit League play last season as well. Plus I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him working the count much more this spring than in the past, which is a good sign. If he can lay off the low sliders, he\xe2\x80\x99ll see much better pitching since he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have more support around him this season (with Nelson Cruz).The Orioles are scheduled to take on Minnesota tonight in Sarasota at 7 PM, however it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether or not the game will be played due to weather in the area. Ubaldo Jimenez was scheduled to start, however he\xe2\x80\x99s been sent to pitch the minor league game in Ft. Myers so as to hopefully get him another start (in an area where the weather is expected to be favorable). If the game is played, Steve Johnson will get the start. Tomorrow is the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lone scheduled off day of the spring. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
03/18/2014,"[('A history of Suk-Min Yoon - Camden Chat, a Baltimore ...', ' On Saturday, March 15, Yoon made his Spring Training debut for the Orioles.  Because of visa issues, he had not been able to pitch in games while other candidates like Gausman and Britton have impressed.  If Yoon starts out in the bullpen and eventually somehow finds his way into the rotation, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be different to how he became one of the best starters in KBO.    1. Amateur Days  Yoon could have faded away as a non-draftee had he not received some external support.  Yoon attended Yatap High School in Seongnam in Gyeong-gi province, which is located nearby south of nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital, Seoul.  Up to the sophomore year, Yoon was only the fourth-best starter on his team and was buried under three teammates who ""exceeded 140 km/h (around 87 mph) and had ace-potential stuff that led to a bunch of mercy games versus opponents"" according to his high school coach.  In fact, Yoon was described to be ordinary - topping out at 131 km/h (81.3 mph) and mostly staying around mid-70\xe2\x80\x99s mph.  His coach had plans to put him at second base but he was ""too slow to stick on that position"".  Yoon himself agreed that he was quite subpar.  From the article, he is quoted ""Even when I reflect back, I really stunk.  The velocity wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there and I was really average.  If I were a manager, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put myself on the mound for game actions.""   However, when Yoon became a junior, he broke out as a pitcher.  The fall before that year, the coach decided to bring out the best of Yoon\xe2\x80\x99s pitching ability and put him into a total workout program.  As a result, the mid-70\xe2\x80\x99s fastball climbed up to high-80\xe2\x80\x99s and he became the ace of the Yatap High.  Scouts were astounded at Yoon\xe2\x80\x99s growth and he became a very attractive target to teams for the 2005 KBO Draft.  According to a KIA Tigers scout, Yoon had a great showcase during a tourney in June that took place in Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 home field. ""If he can throw very well in the team\xe2\x80\x99s home team, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a bad idea to select him,"" said the scout.  The scout also mentioned ""Yoon had a very pretty delivery - ever since we picked him, we told the coaching staff not to tamper with his mechanics.""  The Tigers ended up taking as the first pick of the 2nd round of 2005 KBO Draft. 2. First Years And Stardom The season after he was drafted, Yoon immediately saw the action in KBO as a reliever.  For a 18-year-old, he held himself quite well: 3-4, 4.29 ERA, 7 SV in 84IP.  He broke out as one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s elite closer in 2006 by going 5-6, 2.28 ERA, 19 SV, 75 K\xe2\x80\x99s in 94.2 IP.  Fans nicknamed him ""Gwangju Dam"" (Gwangju is a city that the KIA Tigers are based on) in hopes that Yoon would be the perennial closer for the team for a long time.  However, he switched to being a starter in 2007 (Video of his first win here).  As a 20-year-old-going-21, he had decent numbers - 3.78 ERA (10th in the league) in 162 IP with 104 K\xe2\x80\x99s with 54 walks allowed.  But he ended up with an abysmal 7-18 win-loss record thanks to lack of support from the Tigers lineup (the team finished 8th out of the 8-team league, going 51-74 with 1 draw).  18 losses is the fifth-most in a single season in the history of KBO but given on the promise he showed as a very young starter, Tigers fans were content.     2008 was the first true big year for Yoon in multiple ways.  First off, he was granted exemption from mandatory Korean military service by being a part of the Korean National team that won gold in 2008 Beijing Olympics.  There is a story behind his exemption.  He made it to the candidates entry for the team, but ended up not making the final entry for the last spot of the team - a Doosan Bears RHP reliever named Tae-Hoon Lim took it.  Lim had a solid debut season in 2007 that earned him the Rookie of the Year Award - 7-3, 2.40 ERA, 103.1 IP, 93 K\xe2\x80\x99s and 36 walks.  Those are some great numbers from an 18-year-old rookie against the big guys.  But when the final entry came out, Yoon was in midst of a phenomenal season, leading the league in wins (12), second in ERA (2.47) and third in strikeouts (95) by the All-Star break.  On August 5, only 3 days before the start of Beijing Olympics, the Korean National team manager Gyeong-Moon Kim (who was also manager for Doosan Bears) substituted Lim with Yoon.  Lim had been on a cold streak (0-1 with 9.82 ERA in 7 games after initially making the team) and had not performed well in exhibition games.  At the tournament, Yoon earned 2 wins and a save while going 7.2 IP with 6 K\xe2\x80\x99s as a reliever, being an integral part of the gold medal team.   Yoon continued his hot streak in 2008 and ended the year with 14-5, 2.33 ERA, 154.2 IP, 119 K\xe2\x80\x99s and 45 walks. He finished second for the Golden Glove for pitchers (Note: in Korea, the Golden Glove Award goes to best player in each position, not towards the best fielders) and was chosen to be a part of Korean National team for 2009 World Baseball Classic.  On the semifinals versus Venezuela, Yoon disarmed the potent lineup featuring ML\xe2\x80\x99ers like Miguel Cabrera, Bobby Abreu, Marco Scutaro, etc.  However, after the tournament, Yoon started to feel discomfort on his shoulder.  The Tigers, alarmed about their young ace\xe2\x80\x99s health, placed him in and out of the rotation.  Despite the concerns, Yoon managed a decent 9-4, 3.46 ERA in 119.2 IP line but a notch down from his sublime 2008.  The KIA Tigers, by the way, rebounded from horrible 2007 and 2008 and won the pennant and The Korean Series in a dramatic bout versus the dangerous the SK Wyverns.  (The Game 7 of the Korean Series ended like this)     3. Few Troubles And an MVP Season 2010 posed another health threat to Yoon, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the shoulder.  On June 18, furious with his performance versus SK Wyverns, he slammed his throwing hand in the locker room and fractured his pinky, missing six weeks.  The Tigers weren\xe2\x80\x99t doing well either - after his injury, the team went on a whopping 16-game losing streak.  When Yoon was fully healed in August, they decided to ease him into action by putting him in bullpen.  On August 15, the Kia Tigers were in a race for the 4th place spot (the lowest seed to make the playoffs) and they were playing the Lotte Giants, one of the teams that was also in the running.  Yoon entered the game in relief and hit one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s best hitters, Sung-Heun Hong, on the hand, causing him to miss the rest of the season.  Losing Hong was a big blow for the Giants as the slugger was hitting .350 with 26 HR\xe2\x80\x99s and 116 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s in 110 games so far.  As if that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t already bad enough, only 9 days later, Yoon took the mound as a reliever versus the Giants and hit their leadoff man Sung-Hwan Cho in the head, which brought whole storm of anger from the Giants fans (Video). The saga was very traumatic on Yoon himself.  According to the reports, he could not fall asleep for awhile, his appetite was gone and once he felt nauseous and was hospitalized, causing him to miss some action. Three months after the hit-by-pitch incidents, Yoon had a chance to redeem himself as a member of the Korean National team for the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games.  In the first game versus Taiwan, when Yoon was set to pitch as a reliever in the 7th inning, the officials discovered that they accidentally left out Yoon as a part of the roster in the list.  The righty was ejected without throwing a pitch. If he had pitched, the Team Korea could\xe2\x80\x99ve had to forfeit the game for bringing in a player that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t listed.  After the Korean national team corrected their mistake, Yoon was put in to pitch against the Team Taiwan in the finals. As a reliever, he finished off the Taiwaneses by going 5.0 IP with seven strikeouts, three hits, one walk and no runs, and the Koreans won the gold.   With that, Yoon managed to win back some popularity and gave hope to the Tigers fans for a better 2011 showing.     He didn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint. He had his best season as a starter (Video of his strikeout pitches) by going 17-5, 2.45 in 172.1 IP while recording 178 strikeouts (9.30 K/9) with 44 BB (2.30 BB/9).  Not only that, he won the pitching triple crown (wins, ERA and strikeouts), and he led the league in K/9, FIP, WHIP, quality starts, opponent OPS, double plays induced and IP\xe2\x80\x99s per start.  On November 7, he garnered 61 votes out of 91 to garner the MVP award.  Stuff-wise and record-wise, 2011 was the peak for Yoon.  4. Post-MVP and Shoulder Troubles After playing seven seasons with the Tigers, Yoon was eligible to be posted to the foreign league teams and he wanted to pursue being in the Major Leagues.  ML scouts were interested in him, however, the team declared that they wanted to keep Yoon for the best chance to win the pennant in 2012.  He had a fine 2012, going 9-8, 3.12 ERA in 153 IP.  Going into 2013, Yoon was aware that it would be an important year - he was going to be a free agent in the season\xe2\x80\x99s end and was named as the ace of the Team Korea for 2013 WBC.  However, he took a loss in his only start in the tournament (vs. Netherlands) and Korea was disqualified after the first round.  After the tourney, Yoon started to feel more discomfort on his shoulder.  He started the season late after spending April rehabbing.  But when he got into game action, he showed diminished stuff and unsatisfactory results - 3-6, 4.00 ERA in 87.2 IP.  It was the lowest amount of innings thrown after converting to a starter and his worst ERA since his debut season.    Even after a subpar 2013, Yoon strongly wanted to pursue playing in MLB.  For that, he hired Scott Boras as his agent and flew over to U.S. to work out for interested ML teams, which led to him signing with the Baltimore Orioles.

In October, the 28-year-old had surgery to remove bone chips in his right knee.""A low 4.00 ERA in the American League, it\'s hard to do,"" Showalter said. ""We also know he went through periods where he pitched a lot better than that. I think the big thing is just trying to keep him on the field."" var adSkipCounter = 0; So far that\'s been the most important development involving Chen this spring. He had allowed just three runs in his first nine innings before getting pounded for six runs and 10 hits, including two homers and five doubles, in 32/3 innings Wednesday in a 7-4 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays. The performance pushed his Grapefruit League ERA to 6.39 in 122/3 innings.Still, he struck out five, didn\'t walk a batter and said he was working more on command than trying to set up hitters with a particular sequence.""Some of the pitches were up, so they squared them up. Other than that, I felt pretty good,"" Chen said through interpreter Louis Chao. ""I got more swings and misses with my fastball. I am happy about that. And I\'m also happy about not issuing any walks. So, overall, it was pretty good.""Showalter has not yet announced the order of the rotation beyond Opening Day starter Chris Tillman and No. 2 pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez. But Chen likely will slot into the third spot, pitching April 3 in the finale of the opening series against the Boston Red Sox.""I think he is really important for us,"" said Zach Britton, who has become one of Chen\'s better friends on the club. ""Right now, he is the only lefty in the rotation for a staff that needs to combat those lefty-heavy lineups we are going to face.""After throwing 1922/3 innings in 32 starts as a rookie, Chen was limited to just 23 starts and 137 innings last season. He started off strong, going 6-3 with a 2.87 ERA in his first 12 starts before finishing 1-4 with a 5.55 ERA in his final 11. He failed to complete six innings in five of his last seven outings.The precipitous dropoff led to speculation that he was either fatigued or affected by the knee injury, which didn\'t become public until the October surgery was announced.""I can\'t say that it didn\'t affect me, but I don\'t know actually how much,"" Chen said. ""But for this year, I already got it taken care of, and I\'m going to concentrate on this season \xe2\x80\xa6 And I am not going to think about the knee anymore.""Previously, Showalter and the coaching staff took every precaution available to keep Chen rested, arranging the rotation to give him an extra day when possible. When Chen pitched in Japan, he was accustomed to starting every sixth day.""This will be his third year in a five-man rotation, and you all know how many times we gave him some extra time when we could,"" Showalter said. ""But \xe2\x80\xa6 he is a well-conditioned guy, and I\'m looking forward to him being out there every fifth day for us all season.""Two offseasons ago, Chen spent most of the winter in California working out with club vice president Brady Anderson and a group of pitchers that included Britton and Miguel Gonzalez. The three pitchers formed a close bond \xe2\x80\x94 one that still remains.""We were there almost every day, just kind of interacting with him. He didn\'t have a translator, so he was fending for himself a little bit,"" Britton said. ""It was just about him getting comfortable with [English]. And when he opened up, we saw the Chen that he really is. He\'s really funny, he likes to joke around. And he blends in really well with these guys.""Case in point: Britton recalls a night in Cleveland in which Chen took his former translator, Tim Lin, and Britton to an authentic Taiwanese restaurant. Britton couldn\'t read a word on the menu, and Chen volunteered to order for him. Britton\'s meal looked like ""Jell-O on rice"" and, ""was absolutely disgusting.""""I\'m eating this stuff and I\'m trying not to be rude. To myself I\'m like, \'Oh my god, this stuff is awful,\' "" Britton said. ""[Lin] finally tells me, \'Dude, no one eats that stuff. It\'s the nastiest stuff you will ever have.\' \xe2\x80\xa6 For the next two weeks, Chen thought he was the funniest guy in the world.""As catcher Matt Wieters said: ""Chen fit in right away. His baseball competitive spirit fit in right away, and he is great to have in the clubhouse, too.""Now, the club hopes he\'ll take the next step in his maturation as a pitcher. His initial three-year deal expires after this season, but the Orioles have a team-friendly $4.75 million option for 2015 (with a $372,000 buyout).He\'d likely have to have a truly rough season for the Orioles to not exercise the option. And that\'s the furthest thing from his mind.""Every year the goal is to stay healthy, and this year, I\'m going to try to pitch more innings than before. That\'s my goal,"" Chen said. ""Of course, I want to improve on every aspect of pitching. This year I am going to try and stay on pace and try to improve everything that I can.""dan.connolly@baltsun.comtwitter.com/danconnollysun     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldPriest at once defended, excoriated1969 slayings of 2 women forge police-FBI liaisonA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

Mussina remains the greatest pitcher to ever call Oriole Park at Camden Yards home. Had there only been a little less stubbornness and a little more willingness from the franchise to recognize that a great pitcher deserved to be paid, Mike Mussina might have been the Jim Palmer of our generation: a great, career-long Oriole.    The way Mussina departed the franchise seems to have created a frostiness that endures today. When he was inducted into the O's Hall of Fame in 2012, the speech he gave was cursory and brusque. It was enough to wonder whether he will even have any desire to wear an Orioles cap in the Hall of Fame once the Baseball Writers Association of America electorate gets their collective head out of their hindquarters and elects him into Cooperstown. There can be no mistaking the fact that Mussina is a worthy baseball Hall of Famer. He should be in as an Oriole, too, and they should add a statue of him in Legends Plaza and retire his number, same as they've done with all of the other members of the team who've made it into the Hall. He spent more years in Baltimore, threw more innings here, and his best years were here. He should be the next Oriole in the Hall of Fame. It's just a matter of when the rest of the world gets around to noticing that fact. The Orioles drafted Mussina out of Stanford with the 20th overall pick in the first round of the 1990 draft. He signed for a bonus of $225,000 and went straight to Double-A. He only made a total of 28 starts in the minors before the Orioles called him up for good. The adage from Earl Weaver's days was to break in a young starter in the bullpen. Mussina needed none of that.    They unleashed him on the American League for 12 starts in 1991 and he rewarded them with a 139 ERA+ over 87.2 innings across twelve starts. Counting his minor league time that year, he threw over 200 innings in his debut season as a 22-year-old. The truly great ones are fortunate to not need innings limits or bullpen stints. They're just that good.    Mussina's first full season saw him dazzle the league over 241 innings, putting up a 2.54 ERA - a 157 ERA+ - and holding hitters to a batting line of .239/.279/.348. He finished fourth place in the Cy Young voting and ought to have been in the top two, but writers in those days were enamored with bunches of saves (Dennis Eckersley) and 20 wins (Jack McDowell). He was great. He would continue to be great. That 1992 season was the first year he was named to the All-Star team. He made it back onto the All-Star team the next season, with the game in Baltimore, though he did not appear in the game. You know the story. The name of Cito Gaston, the Blue Jays manager at the helm of the American League team, who left him in the bullpen in Baltimore on that night, shall forever be reviled in the annals of Baltimore sports history. He'll rue the day he left Mussina in the bullpen. I think he just rued again.    In the seasons following that, Mussina was named to three more All-Star teams. He won four Gold Gloves as well. We've spent the time since he departed watching a load of bumblers who often appear to be unaware that they're responsible for fielding baseballs. He was ready to field his position with every pitch. He also had four more top-five finishes in the Cy Young voting as an Oriole. They've had exactly one - a fifth-place finish by Erik Bedard in 2007 - since Mussina left. Though he came close several times, he never did win 20 games as an Oriole. He was hosed on both ends by the baseball strike - 1994, when the season ended early, and 1995, when it started late - and by terrible teammates on the 1999 club. Over a ten-year Orioles career, he threw 2,009 innings with a 3.53 ERA. That sounds modest now, but it was good for a 130 ERA+ at the time, 30% better than the league average. How often have we wished for even one league average pitcher, let alone one as good as Mussina? He more than held his own during the era of inflated offense. Mussina's finest time as an Oriole came during the 1997 postseason. He was so good it's hard to even fathom: four starts between the ALDS against Seattle, outdueling Randy Johnson twice, and the ALCS against Cleveland, during which time all hope was destroyed by Armando Benitez. Mussina himself went 29 innings between these four games, giving up only four earned runs. He also only allowed 18 hits and walks. That's actually ridiculous.    Benitez was not the only goat in the bullpen that series; Alan Mills and Randy Myers also lost games on top of Benitez's two. If not for that, do the Orioles win the 1997 World Series, giving Mussina the championship ring he always deserved? Alas, for what might have been. The totals from his Orioles career are staggering. His 147 wins rank third on the franchise list, and his won-lost percentage of .638 is the highest among O's pitchers who have thrown more than 500 innings. With 1,535 strikeouts, he is behind only Palmer. Mussina is the only Oriole to ever have multiple 200+ strikeout seasons. He had three. Among O's pitchers who threw more than 1,000 innings, his BB/9 of 2.09 stands as the lowest; not surprisingly, his K/BB rate of 3.287 is the highest. By ERA+, Mussina even had a better career than Palmer - 130 to Palmer's 125. Over his O's career, he had 45 complete games and 15 shutouts. That's more shutouts than every Orioles pitcher has in total since Mussina's last season in Baltimore. He had more complete games as an Oriole than every O's pitcher combined since 2003. He was so good, and for the best years of his career, he was ours. He's our #6 greatest Oriole of all time.

The Birds have also had two impromptu days off (including Monday) due to rain outs, but I digress.

However there\xe2\x80\x99s another injury that popped up last week in camp that might be one to watch. Matt Wieters turned his ankle running the bases the middle of last week. At first Buck Showalter was hoping that he\xe2\x80\x99d be able to play this past Saturday, and then it shifted to Monday \xe2\x80\x93 which was rained out.I have no doubt that Wieters will be ready to go and healthy for Opening Day. However what about the time that he missed in camp? AtCourtesy of USA Todaythis point, Wieters hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played in a game in a week since being hurt. Granted he was to be back on this past Monday, but that game was rained out. So do the Orioles have a problem brewing on their hands in that regard?To be blunt, no they do not. Keep in mind that catchers reported approximately a week prior to regular position players, and thus have that extra work under their belts. Wieters is expected to be starting behind the plate this afternoon when the Orioles take on Tampa with Wei-Yin Chen on the mound. However anyone that\xe2\x80\x99s ever seen Wieters play or followed my twitter feed during games (\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t. Run. Ever.\xe2\x80\x9d) knows what an asset Matt Wieters is behind the plate. Fans can rest assured that a few days off aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to affect him as a catcher. (And keep in mind that just because he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played in a game since last week doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked out or worked on his catch and throw skills.)Including the aforementioned game this afternoon, the Orioles have ten games left on their Grapefruit League schedule \xe2\x80\x93 including a couple of split squad days.

He left Montreal just before the Expos\xe2\x80\x99 big season, and was fired by the Red Sox two years before Boston won a title with many of the players he acquired.After almost 10 years away from the front office, Duquette landed with the last-place Orioles after the 2011 season. He added to the talent Andy MacPhail left behind, and two winning seasons followed. With an overpowering lineup and stingy defense, this year\xe2\x80\x99s team should be a major factor in the American League East.

That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much all you need. We have good pitching, and you know you just have to throw strikes, because you have guys behind you to catch every ball.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Jimenez was one of two impact free agents the Orioles signed after arriving at spring training, along with outfielder Nelson Cruz. Those late-winter surprises make it realistic to think that the Orioles, after winning 93 games and a wild-card berth in 2012 \xe2\x80\x94 and 85 games last season \xe2\x80\x94 could win a highly competitive division.The Orioles signed Jimenez for four years and $50 million, forfeiting their No. 1 draft choice for a former All-Star who was 13-9 with a 3.30 earned run average for Cleveland last season. Cruz, who hit 27 homers for Texas despite serving a 50-game drug suspension, signed for one year and $8 million.The deals transformed the vibe around the Orioles, who had been mostly quiet in a division with the World Series champions (Boston), a wild-card winner (Tampa Bay) and a team that spent $470 million on roster upgrades (the Yankees).  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cWe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily done a lot in the off-season, so when we came here, I think there were maybe a few feelings of being let down, that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t really make a big splash,\xe2\x80\x9d first baseman Chris Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then we were obviously really excited once we signed Ubaldo and Nelson, knowing that everybody was on the same page and we were really gearing up for this year.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Davis erupted for 53 homers last season, helping the Orioles lead the majors in that category. They tied for fifth in runs scored, behind the three A.L. division winners and the St. Louis Cardinals, who won the National League pennant.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Good pitching beats good hitting, as the saying goes, but major league teams averaged 4.17 runs per game last season, the lowest mark since 1992. A high-powered offense can be a separator in that environment, and two A.L. teams that scored more than Baltimore last season, Boston and Detroit, lost significant punch in the winter.

If we can work in the strike zone and make the opposing pitchers throw strikes, we should be good.\xe2\x80\x9dMore base runners, of course, would help the Orioles take better advantage of their power. Their .313 on-base percentage last season was five points below the major league average. Cruz, 33, is their oldest everyday player, so perhaps a young team can learn better plate discipline. But Manager Buck Showalter does not want his hitters to lose their aggressiveness.\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been in the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box in the major leagues or the minor leagues, you cannot take until you hit \xe2\x80\x94 you hit until you take,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Hit, hit, hit\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 and then some mechanism says, \xe2\x80\x98Take.\xe2\x80\x99 You can\xe2\x80\x99t go, \xe2\x80\x98Take, take, take,\xe2\x80\x99 and try to hit. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In any case, Showalter said, the Orioles emphasize defense from their regulars, and five have won Gold Gloves within the last three seasons: shortstop J. J. Hardy, outfielders Adam Jones and Nick Markakis, catcher Matt Wieters and third baseman Manny Machado, who could miss opening day while recovering from knee surgery. Even with strong defense last season, Baltimore pitchers had a 4.20 E.R.A., ranking 10th in the A.L.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Duquette traded closer Jim Johnson to Oakland, but Tommy Hunter should be a capable replacement, and a new setup man, Ryan Webb, has strikingly similar statistics to Johnson. The rotation \xe2\x80\x94 with Jimenez, Chris Tillman, Wei-Yin Chen, Bud Norris and Miguel Gonzalez \xe2\x80\x94 is respectable, if unspectacular.On Wednesday, two intriguing names threw from a flat mound as they recover from injuries: the veteran Johan Santana (shoulder) and the top prospect Dylan Bundy (elbow). Both could make a difference this summer.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cYou need all the support you can get,\xe2\x80\x9d Duquette said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long season, and the Yankees and the Red Sox do make you throw a lot of pitches.\xe2\x80\x9dWhile those teams have hoarded eight of the last 18 World Series titles, the Orioles have not won a championship since 1983. The thought of winning one, which would be the first for Duquette in a long career, motivates him, and he just might have a good chance.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one of the driving forces that allows me to get up every day and come to work,\xe2\x80\x9d Duquette said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy philosophy is that you have to have a number of good teams. You have to knock on the door a few times and eventually the door will open for a championship. We have a lot of the ingredients to have a championship team here, and our intent is to see it through.\xe2\x80\x9d  A version of this article appears in print on March 20, 2014, on Page B18 of the New York edition with the headline: The Orioles Are Wired for Winning.

Nor should they force this to happen.<\\/p>\\n<p>It is entirely unarguable that Manny Machado is anything but one of those extraordinarily rare talents that comes along only once in a great while. I think I have a creative and positive imagination for what is possible, but Machado\\u2019s 2013 season was WAY FAR beyond my wildest imaginations.<\\/p>\\n<p>There was no doubt that he should have started the season as the Orioles\\u2019 regular third baseman.

Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 3.2 IP, 10 H, 6 R, 0 BB, 5 K. Perhaps the tone for the game was set when Wil Myers hit the second pitch out of the ballpark. However even though Chen\xe2\x80\x99s ERA ballooned to 6.39 for the spring, the five strikeouts were certainly noteworthy. Suk-min Yoon, who was reassigned to triple-A Norfolk after the game, pitched two innings and gave up a solo homer, and Eric Meek pitched an inning without allowing a hit or a run. As for Chen, while that\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly the type of start you ever want (in a Grapefruit League or regular season game), it\xe2\x80\x99s also something to build on.Offensively for the Orioles we saw a lot of promise out of the bats. While Adam Jones was 2-for-16 coming into the game (for the spring), he played by far his best game to date thus far. Jones reached on an error in the last of the first, and that in and of itself seemed to get his bat on track. However it\xe2\x80\x99s what he did after getting on base that impressed the most. Jones went to steal second base with Chris Davis at the plate, and in doing so noticed that nobody was covering third \xe2\x80\x93 so he took third base as well. Often times guys are so intent with getting to second without getting thrown out that they fail to notice things as such.This all starts with manager Buck Showalter, who\xe2\x80\x99s legendarily noted for paying such close attention to detail. And that\xe2\x80\x99s started to trickle down to Jones and the rest of the team. Jones would later score on Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 RBI-double; odds are he would have scored from second on the play anyways, however you get the point. Often times, especially in a division as competitive as the AL East, small details such as base running (and smart base running at that) can make the difference between winning and losing.Jones would later score on Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 RBI-double, and as I said above he also homered in the game. Again folks, wins and losses aren\xe2\x80\x99t the point here; although, I suspect that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see a bit more emphasis on how the games are unfolding on a situational basis. So with that said it was good to see Nolan Reimold come through with an 11th hour ninth inning RBI-single yesterday. Reimold is currently in a stiff competition for the left field platoon, along with the likes of David Lough, Francisco Peugero, and even Nelson Cruz. Obviously Cruz will be the primary DH, but knowing that he can also play the outfield is a great luxury for the O\xe2\x80\x99s.The Orioles will travel to Bradenton, FL tonight to take on the Pittsburgh Pirates at 7 PM. I also hosted a very impromptu and very truncated version of the Birds Watcher Show this morning, available by clicking here. After yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game the Orioles optioned Suk-min Yoon and catcher Johnny Monell to triple-A Norfolk. Showalter hasn\xe2\x80\x99t committed to Steve Clevenger as the backup catcher, but I suppose given the fact that Monell is headed to Norfolk one could assume he has the job by default.

03/21/2014,"[('Top 40 Orioles of All Time - #5, Frank Robinson - Camden Chat', ' #5 - Frank Robinson, OF (1966-1971) Frank Robinson comes in at #5 on the list of the Top 40 Orioles of All Time, but make no mistake: he was the best baseball player to ever put on an Orioles uniform. Hands down. Where he sits in baseball history is up for debate, but he is reasonably one of the top 25 players in MLB history.    When the Orioles traded for Frank Robinson in the winter of 1965, he was already a bonafide superstar. He had been Rookie of the Year, won an MVP, and had been to five All Star Games in his ten seasons with the Reds. From 1960-1962 he led the National League in slugging three straight years, and from 1961-1964 he lead the league in intentional walks. There is not much I can say about Frank Robinson that you all don\'t already know. When he arrived in Baltimore, he came to a team that was good, but not good enough to get to the playoffs. He\'s credited with giving them the boost they needed to win their first World Series. His first season was his finest in an Orioles uniform. He won the Triple Crown with the most home runs, runs batted in, and the highest batting average in the league. For good measure he also led the league in runs scored, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, total bases, and sacrifice fly. All that contributed to his cool 8.2 WAR that season. And he was just as great in the World Series against the Dodgers, where he took home the series MVP by going 4-for-14 with two home runs, a triple, three walks, four runs scored and three RBI.    By many accounts, Frank Robinson was one of the toughest, most intense players to play the game. If he was knocked down by a pitch, that made him more determined to hit one out, and he took out his aggression on the basepaths with vicious slides in the middle infield. Robinson led the league in getting hit by pitches seven times in his career, and it was revealed at one point that multiple managers charged their pitchers a fine if they hit Robinson on account of how Robinson took it out on the other team when he was.    There is little doubt that part of Robinson\'s hardness on the field was as a result of the racism he faced throughout his career. He played in the minors in the south where he was harassed regularly, and while playing in Cincinnati he received multiple death threats. Things didn\'t get better for him when he came to Baltimore, as he found it difficult to even find a place to live when he was traded. He was a superstar baseball player! A number of years ago I was gifted the book After Jackie. It\'s the story of black baseball players after the color barrier was broken, and the things that they went through in the careers. One chapter was dedicated to Frank Robinson, and in it he told a story about how he visited Baltimore with the Reds in 1958 for an exhibition game, but it got rained out so he decided to go to a movie. When he got to the ticket window they refused to sell him a ticket because it was a whites-only theater. He was in shock. Seven years later he was traded to the Orioles and he didn\'t want to go. He thought, ""I\'ve got to move to Baltimore, and I\'m not going to be able to go to the movies.""    I\'m not as tough as Frank Robinson, so that chapter left me crying. I\'m getting upset recalling it right now. That was the last chapter I read in the book. He went on to be a star in Baltimore and become a beloved member of the Orioles. He is revered in this town these days, and that\'s the way he was treated. After moving to Baltimore and not being able to rent a house in a good neighborhood because of the color of his skin, Frank Robinson became active in the civil rights movement. He made it his business to shed light on the discrimination and bigotry he faced, including on the field. But the discrimination he was subject to didn\'t affect him negatively on the field; if anything, it fueled him. In six seasons with the Orioles, Robinson hit .300/.401/.543 (OPS+ 169) with 179 home runs, 143 doubles, and 460 walks. His wOBA was .415, wRC+ 168. He never once had an OPS+ of less than 151. He helped lead the Orioles to four World Series in six years.    Traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers after the 1971 season, Frank Robinson went on to play five more seasons with the Dodgers, Angels, and Indians. In 1975 the Indians named him player-manager, making him the first African-American manager in the history of baseball. He was back with the Orioles in a front-office position in the mid-1980s, and in 1988 replaced Cal Ripken Sr. as manager. He managed the Orioles through that terrible season and the awesome 1989. He lasted 37 games into 1991 before being replaced. In the recent past, Frank Robinson has been absent from the Orioles family, which is sad. But he returned in April 2012 as his statue was revealed, and in his speech to the crowd he prophetically spoke of a time in the near future when the young talent on the Orioles would come together and be very good. Just a few weeks ago, he made an appearance at spring training to talk to the current Orioles. He wore an orange polo shirt that he joked had been in retirement until a few years ago. When the Orioles created their team Hall of Fame in 1977, Frank Robinson and Brooks Robinson were inducted together as the first two members. In 1982, the first year he was eligible, he was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame with 89.2% of the vote. Despite ten great years with the Reds, he went into Cooperstown in an Orioles cap. He is one of the greatest players in baseball history and the 5th greatest Oriole of all time.

Now, that was the talk of the game.DOWN UNDER: Dodgers win openerColon, who hasn\'t had a hit in the majors since 2005, made contact in three of four at-bats and had an RBI single \xe2\x80\x93 a hard grounder past third base and into the left-field corner that would have been a double for anybody else \xe2\x80\x93 in the Mets\' 10-2 win over the Miami Marlins.""I told him if he hits one of those in Miami, he better try to get to second because it\'s a long way out there,\'\' manager Terry Collins said. ""He may hit fifth if he continues to hit good.\'\'Colon is a .104 career hitter \xe2\x80\x93 10-for-96 \xe2\x80\x93 in 16 seasons mercifully spent almost exclusively in the American League, except for a three-month stint with the Montreal Expos in 2002.But now that he\'s facing a full season of having to step up to the plate \xe2\x80\x93 if not necessarily hit \xe2\x80\x93 Colon could use some practice, and he got plenty as the Mets pounded Marlins pitchers for 13 hits.His first time up, the 40-year-old Colon didn\'t even pretend to swing as he struck out looking on three pitches, and that figured to be his hitting approach the rest of the game.But something happened between the second inning and the fourth, when Colon hit a slow comebacker for an easy out that still elicited a lively response from the Mets dugout and their fans behind it.Then in the sixth, Colon ripped a 93 mph fastball from Henry Rodriguez for the RBI single.""Really, the ball found the bat,\'\' Colon said. ""I really didn\'t do anything.\'\'The 5-11, 265-pound Colon did have to run the bases, as Eric Young Jr. followed with a deep drive to center that wound up hopping over the fence for a ground-rule double.That sight of Colon motoring around drew some chuckles, but Collins said not to be deceived by his girth.""This guy\'s a better athlete than what he\'s teasing you about. Don\'t get too caught up in that,\'\' Collins said. ""This guy\'s got great feet, he\'s got great hands. He knows when he\'s got to do something right.\'\'Like keeping his legs healthy instead of blowing out a hamstring trying for a hit. In his final at-bat in the seventh, Colon hit a slow dribbler to third that the vast majority of the baseball population would have turned into an infield single. He was thrown out at first.""Honestly, I was a little scared,\'\' Colon said of running the bases in general. ""I haven\'t done that in a while. Thankfully nothing happened.\'\'GALLERY: GRAPEFRUIT LEAGUEFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInGrapefruit League photos from spring training\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Will he be ready for Opening Day? When will we actually see him in a game? I\xe2\x80\x99ve maintained since January that my personal opinion was that Machado would start getting into games towards the end of spring training, would probably be sent to extended spring training once the team broke camp, go out on a rehab assignment, and eventually rejoin the O\xe2\x80\x99s towards the end of April to guard the hot corner. The Orioles haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet publically said that Machado wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be ready on Opening Day, however at this point that appears to be a bit of a stretch.Machado was examined by\xc2\xa0Dr. Neal ElAttrache in Los Angeles this week, and he returned toCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsSarasota yesterday after the good doctor cleared him to resume workouts. Machado no longer has any medical restrictions. However Buck Showalter hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said when we\xe2\x80\x99ll actually see Machado in a game. Anyone that\xe2\x80\x99s seen how Showalter operates since he\xe2\x80\x99s been with the Birds knows that there\xe2\x80\x99s usually more than meets the eye going on in his brain. My point is that I suspect that Showalter and Dan Duquette have a plan in place in terms of when Machado will start playing, how much work he\xe2\x80\x99ll get, etc.All Orioles fans want to see Machado at Camden Yards on Opening Day. However I would submit that Machado playing on Opening Day might not be in the best interests of the organization. Granted every situation is different, however I recall that in 2010 Brian Roberts was bothered by back spasms for most of camp and didn\xe2\x80\x99t start playing in games until the final week or so of spring training; we all know how that turned out. Roberts strained his back in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 home opener, and quite frankly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the same since.Obviously Roberts was an aging veteran at the time, and Machado is a budding star. He\xe2\x80\x99s also more important to the organization than Roberts was at the time of his injury. However my point is that often rushing someone back after being hurt causes more harm. So as I said, I suspect we\xe2\x80\x99ll see Machado stay in Sarasota after the Orioles pack up and leave at the end of next week, and play in a few extended spring games. He\xe2\x80\x99ll probably then head up perhaps to double-A Bowie (only for proximity reasons) for rehab starts before joining the Orioles in late April.Miguel Gonzalez became the first Oriole starter to pitch six innings in a spring training game yesterday as the Birds defeated Atlanta 8-0. Gonzalez was moved up a day in the \xe2\x80\x9crotation\xe2\x80\x9d (so-to-speak) due to Chris Tillman coming down with a 24-hour flu bug that\xe2\x80\x99s made it\xe2\x80\x99s way through the clubhouse. Unfortunately this is something that we often see in baseball given the amount of time the players spend together. Ubaldo Jimenez will get the ball this afternoon when the O\xe2\x80\x99s head to Port Charlotte, FL to take on the Tampa Rays. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
03/23/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Two More Minor League Signings', 'Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsSome people call it dumpster diving, others call it organizational depth.\xc2\xa0 Dave Trembley, above with Brett Wallace, would have liked a little more organizational depth when he was in Baltimore.Dan Duquette and the Baltimore Orioles just continue to shop for more players. A few days ago, the team signed Luis Ayala, who the Orioles had traded to Atlanta for Chris Jones. Ayala struggled away from Baltimore, but now is back with a minor league deal.Saturday, the team announced they had reached an agreement on a minor league deal with David Adams. Adams, who started 38 games last year for the New York Yankees, is a very polished fielder. He is not quite as strong with his bat, hitting .193 in 2013 with 27 hits and 13 RBIs.Adams was for the Cleveland Indians this spring, appearing in 17 games and getting 9 hits in 32 at-bats for a .281 batting average. Adams, 27, is likely to be another utility infielder in the Orioles organization. And with some of their other utility options, such as Alexi Casilla and Alex Gonzalez either making the team or possibly opting out, the Orioles will need that depth.But, that\xe2\x80\x99s not all. The Orioles announced today (Sunday) the signing of Brett Wallace to a minor-league deal. Wallace, a corner infielder, was the first round pick by the St. Louis Cardinals in 2008.Wallace has played 311 major league games in his career, all with the Houston Astros. He is a career .242 hitter, with 29 home runs. Wallace, also 27, is a guy who strikes out a lot, but some think he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite figured it out yet. He does have several good hitting years in the minor leagues.Dan Duquette, speaking of the signing to MASN Sports\xe2\x80\x99 Roch Kubatko, said the following about Wallace, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at his numbers in the minors, he\xe2\x80\x99s hit over .300 there. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t translated as effectively to the big leagues, so maybe a little more time will help with that. He can hit. He hit 24 home runs last year between Triple-A and the big leagues.\xe2\x80\x9dI like both signings. Neither are guys who are going to make the Opening Day roster, but you never know when injuries could become an issue. And let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, the positional depth among the Orioles minor leagues is a weakness, so bringing in some capable players is not a bad thing.The team has a lot of decisions in the next eight days to get the team from the current number of players in major league camp to 25 for Opening Day. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: What is Wieters worth? - Birds Watcher', 'Mar 8, 2014; Sarasota, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles catcher Matt Wieters (32) hits an RBI single during the second inning against the Boston Red Sox at Ed Smith Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsI\xe2\x80\x99m torn, as many Orioles fans are, about a potential contract extension for two-time all-star catcher Matt Wieters. On one hand, I love certain things about Matt Wieters. I\xe2\x80\x99ll laugh when a poor lost soul tries to swipe second. I\xe2\x80\x99ll laud Wieters for his ability and desire to catch every day. I love his positive attitude and his handling of the wide range of Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching \xe2\x80\x94 from inexperienced super talents like Kevin Gausman, to over-the-hill finesse pitchers like Joe Saunders.Then he comes to the plate.Once considered a prime hitting prospect Wieters has not lived up to the \xe2\x80\x9cSwitch-Hitting-Jesus\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cMauer-With-Power\xe2\x80\x9d monikers. Some have wondered whether he should give up the switch-hitting part altogether. No one draws the comparison to the perennial .300-hitting Joe Mauer anymore.Instead, the Orioles get a healthy 20 home runs per year and a not-so-healthy batting average. Last year, the real killer was a bottom-scraping .287 on-base-percentage coupled with his career-low .235 average. Even second baseman and utility infielder Ryan Flaherty, who many would argue was the worst hitter on last year\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles team, bested Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 lowly OBP.When it comes down to it, the Orioles are paying for two good-to-very-good attributes from Wieters, his power and his defense. But how much is that worth, and how much is that offset by his below average production in other areas.From early indications, Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 agent Scott Boras seems to think that Wieters is worth a lot. According to ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Buster Olney, Boras proposed an extension somewhere in the range of the eight-year, $184 million deal that Mauer signed before the 2013 season.In 2012, 29-year-old catcher Yadier Molina signed a five-year, $75 million extension with the St. Louis Cardinals. At the time, Molina had won four consecutive Gold Gloves and made the All-Star team three times. He was coming off a 2011 season where he hit .305/.349/.465 over 139 games and his career was trending upward.Wieters put up comparable numbers to Molina earlier in his career, batting .262/.328./.450 and .249/.329/.435 in 2011 and 2012, respectively, while hitting 22 and 23 home runs during those seasons. Before his backslide in 2013, I would have said that Wieters deserves similar money. But now, giving Wieters a contract worth the same average annual value as Molina ($15 million per year) seems like overpaying for an inferior performance.Before this season, Wieters and the Orioles agreed to a one-year, $7.5 million deal to avoid arbitration. Paying much more than that is becoming increasingly less attractive for the Orioles and their fans. While having Wieters around is great for now, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done enough to warrant a long term deal on the same level that he\xe2\x80\x99s reportedly asked for. What he brings to the table, defense and power, are two things the Orioles currently have a surplus of. If the team needs to cut costs to sign other stars like Chris Davis, catcher may be the position to do it. It can afford to bring in a replacement-level player, perhaps Baltimore product Steve Clevenger, to handle duties behind the plate in a couple years. He may actually be an improvement on offense given the way that Wieters performed last year.If Wieters continues to show that he may not be worth a high-cost long-term commitment with his play this year, the Orioles are left with two options: make Wieters a qualifying offer when he walks in 2015, thus recouping a first-round draft pick, or trade him.Either way, Matt Wieters should not be a Baltimore Oriole beyond the 2015 season unless his contract demands dramatically decrease. Stellar defense and power are great, but at what cost? The Orioles have more important paydays coming up in Davis and Manny Machado.

03/24/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Dan Duquette Does It Again', 'Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY SportsAlright, let\xe2\x80\x99s not even try to sugar coat things, Dan Duquette may be a genius.\xc2\xa0 Who else trades a 37-year-old who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played more than 50 games in two seasons for a player who is already a proven utility player on a winning team?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought.Alex Gonzalez deserves a lot of credit for this.\xc2\xa0 He had a GREAT spring for the Baltimore Orioles, and now is rewarded by a starting spot on what I believe is one of the top three teams in the AL, the Detroit Tigers (with the Orioles and Boston Red Sox). Gonzalez was 12-28 this spring for a .429 average, and is always a good fielding option.\xc2\xa0 In fact, Buck Showalter commented Monday that Gonzalez was going to make the Orioles as a utility infielder had he not been traded.But in return, the Orioles get Steve Lombardozzi Jr.\xc2\xa0 There is a lot to like here for Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans.First, Lombardozzi comes from a baseball family, as his dad was a major leaguer.\xc2\xa0 Also, he lives in Columbia, Maryland and grew up going to Orioles games.Lombardozzi is only 25-years-old, a significant 12 years younger than Gonzalez.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He also is under team option until 2018.Lombardozzi can play second base, third base and the outfield, and is a switch-hitter.\xc2\xa0 He played in over 100 games in each of the last two seasons for the Washington Nationals, hitting .273 and .279 respectively.While his numbers aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to wow you, he presents much more to the Orioles future than a 37-year-old.\xc2\xa0 And with the Tigers being a team built to win now, this trade in the end does make some sense for both teams.But I still think that the Orioles won this trade easily.\xc2\xa0 Remember, Lombardozzi was the biggest name traded to Detroit when they traded Doug Fister to the Nationals.What else this trade means is several things for players currently vying for a roster spot.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, Ryan Flaherty is going to be on the roster.\xc2\xa0 One would believe Lombardozzi will be too, even though he has minor league options.\xc2\xa0 So that means Alexi Casillia, for one, is likely gone.\xc2\xa0 Jonathan Schoop is likely headed to AAA, which will allow him to prove his spring training after bulking up is no fluke.Jemile Weeks will probably also be headed to AAA Norfolk, while Michael Almanzar likely is headed to back to the Red Sox, unless the Orioles can work out a trade.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is a high possibility, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be shocked if it is Weeks who goes to the Red Sox.

The Orioles defeated the Yankees 6-3. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIs Dan Duquette the Imelda Marcos of the Baltimore Orioles? The who? Some of you reading this are likely too young to remember the wife of The Philippines\xe2\x80\x99 ousted Dictator Ferdinand Marcos. She garnered worldwide fame for her excessive lifestyle when it was revealed that she left behind over 1200 pairs of shoes. So does DD collect and horde ballplayers in this fashion?Or maybe a better illustration is a do-it-yourselfer dude and Home Depot. At some point when I got a credit card there, I became an email client where I get a daily \xe2\x80\x98deal of the day\xe2\x80\x99 notification. I suppose some men cannot resist running into the orange box store and making the most of the sale, whether they need that tool or not! Is that the way Duquette is with the waiver wire?Over the weekend the Orioles have signed two infielders to minor league deals: former Yankees second baseman David Adams \xe2\x80\x93 who was claimed off waivers from the Indians, and Brett Wallace \xe2\x80\x93 a corner infielder who played portions of four seasons with the Astros.Probably most Orioles fans wonder \xe2\x80\x9cwhy?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Why get these guys with very marginal statistics who are so unlikely to really make an impact, and who sometimes clog up the system? Actually, these are not players who clog the system, as the Orioles do need to fill out the position player roles with sufficient level-appropriate talent throughout the organization.And yes, most of these acquisitions are long-shot types, and each of these most recent additions are in their age 27 year. But a common theme for both Adams and Wallace \xe2\x80\x93 and almost always with these deals \xe2\x80\x93 is that they were high draft choices. There was something about them in terms of their past performances and athleticism that had them valued so highly, and perhaps something will at long last click and they will put the pieces together such that the Orioles really have something.Some years ago I had befriended a young man who was a minor league player for the Hagerstown Suns when they were a Toronto affiliate. He was a late-round draft pick but was hitting very well \xe2\x80\x93 well into the .300s, whereas another top-round draftee hitting 100 points less was advanced up the system instead. Noting this situation, I remember the guy telling me, \xe2\x80\x9cTop draft picks will be given innumerable opportunities to prove that can\xe2\x80\x99t do it, whereas a late-round guy like me will only have a short window of time to prove that we can.\xe2\x80\x9dSo that is some of what we are seeing here with these, and other choices.

03/25/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles Roster \\u2013 Reviewing Spring Training ...', '\xc2\xa0Mar 10, 2014; Bradenton, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles second baseman Jonathan Schoop (6) smiles in the dugout against the Pittsburgh Pirates at McKechnie Field. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsWith only a few days remaining until the beginning of the actual baseball season (ahhh \xe2\x80\xa6 that was a beautiful phrase to write while looking out the window here in Maryland and watching the snow fall), we may recall that just a month ago a whole series of spring training questions were being asked by everyone about the 2014 Baltimore Orioles roster.Have those questions been answered? There are some definite answers, some probable answers, and some questions still much up in the air.Definitely Answered QuestionsWill Manny Machado be ready to start the season?\xc2\xa0 This has been a daily question, and we now know that the answer is \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I never truly expected he would be able to play on March 31st. I\xe2\x80\x99m simply pleased it will only be a few more weeks, in light of all that he has gone through over the offseason with the surgery and recovery. If he can come back at all before April is over and be productive, I would term that to be a \xe2\x80\x9cbullet averted.\xe2\x80\x9dWho will be the primary designated hitter?\xc2\xa0 This question was answered rather clearly when the Orioles signed Nelson Cruz. Though he will likely have some games in the field, this looks to be the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 primary DH. It very much strengthens the center of the batting order, and Cruz has had a good spring season.Who will be the backup catcher?\xc2\xa0 The Orioles have been working hard to bolster the catching situation throughout the organization. And though both Johnny Monell and Steve Clevenger put up good numbers and demonstrated sufficiently strong defensive skills, the job is going to be given to the latter. Clevenger had half of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 hits in today\xe2\x80\x99s 4-1 loss to Minnesota as he went 3-for-3, and is now batting .484.\xc2\xa0 It would be great if this could continue and give Matt Wieters more days off.Questions With Probable AnswersWhat will be the composition of the starting rotation? There has been a partial three-part answer in Chris Tillman, Wei-Yin Chen, and Miguel Gonzalez. Beyond that was the assumption that Bud Norris was a likely fourth starter. But with securing Ubaldo Jimenez, along with Norris pitching relatively well, the rotation seems set. But something will happen to change it along the way somewhere \xe2\x80\x93 it almost always does morph for almost every team. And when it does, there are good options in players like Brian Matusz, Zach Britton, and Kevin Gausman.Who will be the closer?\xc2\xa0 Though it has not been announced, the presumption continues to be that it is Tommy Hunter. I lack confidence in this, but then again, I lack confidence in almost every closer and would rather see two or three relievers who understand they might be called upon to fulfill that role. But Hunter is as good as any to start with, though I\xe2\x80\x99d almost bet there will be someone else by August or September. Yet I\xe2\x80\x99d love to be wrong on this one.Questions Yet To Be AnsweredWho will play left field, and who will be the utility outfielders / DHs? \xc2\xa0It would seem almost certain that David Lough will be the most common person in left field, though Cruz may play as well. Henry Urrutia looks destined for Norfolk. So the battle comes down to keeping two of these four: Nolan Reimold, Steve Pearce, Delmon Young, and Quintin Berry. This is difficult.Who will comprise the seven-man bullpen?\xc2\xa0 Five names were/are certain \xe2\x80\x93 Britton, Matusz, Hunter, Ryan Webb, and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day. The final two spots will have to come from between Josh Stinson, Evan Meek, Brad Brach, and Alfredo Aceves. I would choose in that order, but anything could happen here. \xc2\xa0<<Update \xe2\x80\x93 Brad Brach has been sent to AAA.>>Who will be the most regular second baseman?\xc2\xa0 Several events have complicated this question. Since Machado will start the season on the DL, presumptive 2B frontrunner Ryan Flaherty is now the presumptive 3B frontrunner. Yesterday, Steve Lombardozzi was added to the Orioles upon the trade with the Tigers for Alex Gonzalez. And rising star Jonathan Schoop has brought his bulked-up new body to camp and smoked the ball. All three could be kept \xe2\x80\x93 with Schoop on second and Flaherty on third.Another issue involved with this decision has to do with the complicated rules of long-term team control of a player. If the Orioles delay in bringing up Schoop until a specific later time, they will gain an extra year of his services. In this event, Lombardozzi could start at second base with Alexi Casilla as the backup.Any other year than this year, the preceding scenario is what would be played out with the Orioles. However, this is 2014. This is the year that the Orioles gave a free agent starting pitcher a four-year deal, and in the same immediate timeframe brought in a Korean pitcher in Suk-min Yoon and signed a one-year deal with Cruz. If the Orioles begin the season with Schoop, that looks to me like yet another move in a new \xe2\x80\x9cwin now\xe2\x80\x9d era for the Baltimore Orioles.Final Word \xe2\x80\x93 20 Baltimore Orioles roster spots are certain. The outstanding questions are the two-of-four choices in the outfield and the final bullpen composition, and the clarification of Schoop or Casilla.

But we will also pull in the Terps and other Maryland sports quotes and links to stories.1. \xc2\xa0Curacao natives Jonathan Schoop and the Braves\xe2\x80\x99 shortstop Andrelton Simmons \xe2\x80\xa6These two players lived only a few miles apart on Curacao and were high school rivals, and though they talked before the game, when Schoop made it to second base he refused to get into a conversation. Buck Showalter noted this and said, \xe2\x80\x9cJonathan\xe2\x80\x99s trying to make the club. I\xe2\x80\x99m watching and this guy is trying to engage him and get Jonathan to talk, and Jonathan won\xe2\x80\x99t even acknowledge him. \xe2\x80\xa6 I was watching. He was like, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not messing around here at all.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9dLater Schoop said to Showalter about how close they lived to one another, \xe2\x80\x9cBuck, the island is only 100 miles long, if that. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s a neighbor.\xe2\x80\x9d2. \xc2\xa0The North Carolina boy who cried when his favorite player Steve Smith was traded \xe2\x80\xa6The video of this little boy\xe2\x80\x99s meltdown went viral. Smith said upon finding out about this, \xe2\x80\x9cI gotta meet him and hook him up with some new Ravens gear\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 which he did. An article about this little boy named Gavin can be found here.3. \xc2\xa0Steve Smith is pulled over by the cops while talking on a live sports show \xe2\x80\xa6While driving and doing a live interview on ESPN radio\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Dan Le Batard Show,\xe2\x80\x9d Steve Smith was pulled over by the police. He of course assumed he was getting a ticket for cell phone use (I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what state he was in at the time.). \xc2\xa0After being gone a few minutes he returned to the call to say that he did not get busted at all. Trying to explain what happened, Smith said, \xe2\x80\x9cNah, you know. Uh, hey, a brother driving a nice car \xe2\x80\xa6 You know, sometimes they got to make sure it all matches up.\xe2\x80\x9d4.\xc2\xa0 In a David Lough interview with MASN\xe2\x80\x99s Roch Kubatko \xe2\x80\xa6The new Orioles outfielder is obviously liking his new team and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI led off, just trying to get on base, and look what happens when I get on base. I score runs. Look who\xe2\x80\x99s hitting behind me. It\xe2\x80\x99s an army behind me. It really is. It\xe2\x80\x99s awesome.\xe2\x80\x9d5.\xc2\xa0 Smithsburg, Maryland / Smiths of the Ravens \xe2\x80\xa6As I had written earlier in an article, the Ravens now have four \xe2\x80\x9cSmiths\xe2\x80\x9d on the team: Torrey Smith, Steve Smith, Daryl Smith, and Jimmy Smith. One other NFL team has three. But here is a quick little article about a real town named Smithsburg, MD. This is humorous for me since I live close to this place in Washington County.

Our own network\xe2\x80\x99s Tigers site said, \xe2\x80\x9cSo that whole \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable with our internal options at shortstop\xe2\x80\x99 bit?

Simmons was hoping to mess with the kid, distract him, make him laugh. But Schoop, who had spent several minutes before the game chatting with Simmons, wanted no parts of the potential frivolity.""This guy is trying to engage him and get Jonathan to [mess] around. And Jonathan won\'t even acknowledge him,"" Showalter said. ""He\'s looking out at his outfielders, signaling \'two outs,\' which is good. He was like, \'I ain\'t messing around here at all.\' ""In one sense, it was a fleeting snapshot in a forgettable Grapefruit League game. But there also was some significance to it: Simmons and Schoop are countrymen from the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao, which has become a professional baseball hotbed. var adSkipCounter = 0; They\'ve played against each since they were about 8 years old; they\'ve trained together in the offseason. And they were two of seven players in the major leagues last year from tiny Curacao, which is 171 square miles and has a population of about 150,000 \xe2\x80\x94 roughly one-fourth of Baltimore City\'s.""You like your percentage of return from there,"" Showalter said. ""I don\'t know per square mile there\'s ever been a better [talent producer] with where they are right now. There\'s a bunch of them.""And the Orioles are hoping there will be a bunch more soon. There are currently seven players from Curacao in the organization \xe2\x80\x94 Schoop is the only one on the precipice of the majors \xe2\x80\x94 including six originally signed by the team. Not only does Curacao produce major leaguers \xe2\x80\x94 14 in the country\'s history, with half playing in 2013 \xe2\x80\x94 the quality is pretty impressive.Simmons, 24, won the 2013 National League Platinum Glove Award as that league\'s best defender. Texas Rangers infielder Jurickson Profar, 21, has widely been considered among baseball\'s best prospects. Didi Gregorius, who was born in the Netherlands but lives in Curacao, played in 100 games at shortstop for the Arizona Diamondbacks last year at age 23.And then there is the 22-year-old Schoop, who is making a real run at becoming the Orioles\' Opening Day second baseman even though he has only five games of major league experience \xe2\x80\x94 all coming last September.""Growing up with him, playing against him, he was always a good player,"" Simmons said of Schoop, his teammate on the Netherlands\' 2013 World Baseball Classic team. ""But playing with him last year for the Dutch national team, I really saw what he was capable of on a big stage. So this doesn\'t surprise me at all.""Simmons remembers Schoop as a thin kid with potential, but didn\'t expect him to grow into a 6-foot-2, 225-pound slugger.""He always hit OK, but he never crushed balls like he does now,"" Simmons said. ""I\'ve seen him do terrible things to baseballs lately. It just shows how much he\'s grown and improved.""In the sporting world, Curacao is known more for windsurfing than baseball. The sport isn\'t played in high school, there are no baseball academies and most games are played only on weekends in organized amateur leagues. That makes scouting the island somewhat tricky because, with less exposure to a player, the margin for error increases.Yet Orioles international scout Calvin Maduro said the percentage of amateur Curacaoan signees who eventually make the majors is higher than any other country. The players are often highly coachable, and because education is the country\'s primary focus and not sports, those who advance to the professional level seem determined to become major leaguers.""We have the talent in Curacao,"" Simmons said. ""But we also have the discipline and the will to work.""The country\'s first major leaguer was Hensley ""Bam Bam"" Meulens, whom the New York Yankees acquired for a $5,000 bonus in 1985. He spent parts of seven seasons in the majors. The scout who signed Meulens was Fred Ferreira, who is now the Orioles\' executive director of international recruiting.Curacao really landed on the baseball map in 1996, when 19-year-old Braves center fielder Andruw Jones debuted on his way to a splendid 17-season career in which he won 10 consecutive Gold Gloves (1998-2007). A few years later, the Orioles promoted their first Curacao native, infielder Ivanon Coffie, who played in 23 games in 2000.In 2004, Curacao\'s baseball program received another boost when the country won the Little League World Series. Profar was a hitting star and Schoop batted third and picked up the save in the championship game.Now the youth programs that began to thrive with Jones\' ascension are bearing fruit in the majors. And the Orioles are hoping to continue that trend in the next few years. Maduro and Ferreira each take about four trips a year to Curacao looking for the next Simmons or Schoop.""You\'ll see some more ballplayers come out of there now with these players playing in the big leagues,"" Orioles executive vice president Dan Duquette said. ""Because [the kids] will all emulate the players in the big leagues, and it will all perpetuate itself.""dan.connolly@baltsun.comtwitter.com/danconnollysunCuracao connectionThe Orioles have seven players from Curacao in their organization.Jonathan Schoop, 22, infielderSharlon Schoop, 26, infielderRoderick Bernadina, 21, outfielderJonatan Isenia, 20, right-handed pitcherAdema Rifaela, 19, outfielderRochendrick Alexander, 19, outfielderWendell Floranus, 18, right-handed pitcher     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldPriest at once defended, excoriated1969 slayings of 2 women forge police-FBI liaisonA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

03/26/2014,"[('Top 40 Orioles of All Time: #3, Jim Palmer - Camden Chat', ' #3 - Jim Palmer, RHP (1965-1984) It\'s tough to write about Jim Palmer with any degree of originality. There are the Orioles fans who are old enough to have seen him play, and there is a younger generation of Orioles fans who have learned all about his amazing career from the man himself, who has been a broadcaster for the Orioles since not long after he retired in 1984. But regardless of how well we all know his stats and history, it\'s certainly worth repeating. Because Jim Palmer was a fantastic pitcher.    Jim Palmer was signed by the Orioles when he was just seventeen years old and made his debut in 1965 as a 19 year old. In that year he pitched mostly in relief and as a spot starter, and in 1966 he made the rotation out of spring training and pitched over 200 innings as the team won its first World Series. He started game two and pitched a complete game shutout against Sandy Koufax. Yes, things were looking good for Jim Palmer.  Credit: Getty Images Unfortunately, he didn\'t have as much success in 1967. He was demoted to the minors after seven starts and spent the next year and a half injured or ineffective. The Orioles placed him on waivers near the end of the 1968 season and he didn\'t get claimed. Ouch. But he worked through his injuries and started the 1969 season with the Orioles, never to go back to the minors until a rehab stint in 1983. From 1969-1971, the years that saw the Orioles go to the World Series three straight times, Palmer pitched in 102 games with an ERA of just 2.61. On August 13, 1969, Palmer pitched a no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox, just four days after he came off of the disabled list. He walked six batters but history doesn\'t remember that part. (That reminds me of my favorite Palmer-as-broadcaster stories. When Erik Bedard pitched a complete game against the Texas Rangers in 2007 with 15 strikeouts, Palmer\'s broadcasting partner Gary Thorne asked rhetorically, ""Have you ever seen a better pitched game than that?"" To which Palmer replied, ""Well, I did throw a no-hitter."")     Palmer with his 1975 Cy Young Award. Credit: Getty Images Palmer got even better after that, and in 1973 his league-leading 2.40 ERA helped him capture the first of his three career Cy Young Awards. He also came in second in the voting for the A.L. MVP. His second Cy Young came in 1975 when he pitched 323 innings with a 2.09 ERA and his third came in 1976 with 315 IP and a 2.51 ERA.    The Orioles were back in the playoffs in 1979, which meant Palmer was playing in his fifth World Series. He made two starts against the Pirates. In game two he gave up two runs in seven innings, but Don Stanhouse took the loss in the ninth inning. And in game six Palmer took the loss with four runs allowed in eight innings.     Credit: Getty Images   It\'s well known to Orioles fans that Palmer and his manager, legend Earl Weaver, weren\'t the best of friends. They sniped at each other through the press, they argued publicly and privately. Can you even imagine such a thing happening today? But the Orioles were winners and Jim Palmer was a star, so something was working. Later in life, Palmer admitted that Earl Weaver pushed him to be a better pitcher, even as they butted heads.    When the Orioles reached the World Series in 1983, Jim Palmer was near the end of his career. He had pitched in just 14 games during the season, and in the WS he made just one appearance, pitching two scoreless innings in relief in game three. In May 1984, after pitching just a handful of poor games, the Orioles released Palmer at his request, ending his major-league career. But what a career it was. Of course, Palmer has made himself a new career as a broadcaster, which he has been doing since the 1980s. (He took a break in 1991 for his failed comeback attempt) Palmer rubs some people the wrong way in the broadcast booth, and I can see why. He is arrogant and self centered, sometimes making it seem as though he believes he\'s on the Jim Palmer Show and not covering a major-league baseball game. But I think he\'s fantastic, and I\'ll tell you why. In addition to be extremely intelligent (he can remember stats off the top of his head like no one I\'ve seen), Palmer has always told it like it is. He wants the Orioles to win, but when they\'re awful, he says so. He\'s a lot like a fan in that regard, getting disgusted with their failings even though you know that he just wants them to play well. And after awhile, his self serving stories are kind of fun, because he\'s Jim Palmer and you\'re not. In 19 big league seasons, all with the Orioles, Jim Palmer pitched in 558 games with a 2.86 ERA (ERA+ 125). Four times he led the league in innings pitched, twice in ERA. In 1975 he pitched 10 shutouts, most in baseball, and in his career he had 53. He won three Cy Young Awards, was a six-time All Star, and pitched in six American League Championship Series and six World Series. He benefited from having a world class defense behind him for most of his career, but I won\'t hold that against him as he\'s the first to admit it.    The next time the Baltimore Orioles are in the World Series, it will be their first appearance without Jim Palmer. He was elected into the Orioles Hall of Fame in 1986 and the MLB Hall of Fame in 1990 with 92.6% of the vote. He is the third-greatest Oriole of all time.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest; I was stunned when the Birds made a flurry of moves within days of the team reporting to Spring Training. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why I was so surprised, especially given that the likes of Jimenez, Cruz, and numerous others were still out on the market. It would stand to reason that once teams are actually starting to report, the price would come down, right?Change often comes slowly, especially for me! However in the past we would rarely see player aquisitions as late as we saw the Orioles signing some of the aforementioned names. Heck, the team was STILL making trades as late as yesterday with Steve Lombardozzi! So when I say I was stunned that they made such big waves so late in the game, that\xe2\x80\x99s probably the reason why.So the question now becomes, do the Orioles have any other surprises in store before the season starts? Notice I said\xc2\xa0before\xc2\xa0the season starts. I suspect that once the first pitches fly and we get into the season next week, most of the hot stove talk will quiet down until June or July. (That\xe2\x80\x99s generally the case, but of course in the past teams wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t iron out deals a the beginning of spring training, either.) If there\xe2\x80\x99s one area that might still be in question, I suppose one could submit the back end of the bullpen. Presumably, Tommy Hunter is going to be the closer come Monday (note the Jimmy Buffet reference). However could that change?Top-to-bottom, the Orioles have one of the best lineups in baseball. But the relief pitching could at times be better. The O\xe2\x80\x99s were 10-21 in one-run games last season, and for that trend to be reversed the back end of the \xe2\x80\x98pen is going to have to step it up. However I presume that if that ends up being suspect, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have the horses currently in the organization to do some sort of patch job in-season.Generally what occurs is that teams get to the middle of June before they start evaluating if they might be able to swing a deal to add someone. So I suspect that the 2014 O\xe2\x80\x99s will be no exception. Furthermore, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anyone of consequence that they could add at this point. Having said that, all teams will be making their final cuts towards the end of this week and into the first part of the weekend. So for all we know there might be someone that ends up on the waiver wire who\xe2\x80\x99s of interest to Dan Duquette. Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be anyone of consequence; probably just a player that could be stashed in Norfolk or Bowie in case he\xe2\x80\x99s needed later (your classic \xe2\x80\x9corganizational depth\xe2\x80\x9d type of guy).

He was out of options on a team loaded with major league quality depth, and with his past inconsistencies, there\xc2\xa0was a good chance the Orioles\xc2\xa0would be forced to move on. Whether he was claimed on waivers by another team or the Orioles had worked out a deal, it looked inevitable his days in an Orioles uniform were numbered. However, after a impressive spring, Britton may be developing into a key piece of the bullpen.With a mid-90\xe2\x80\x99s sinker, it has never been a question of stuff, but he has struggled to harness that raw ability over his three seasons as an Oriole. The former third-round pick debuted in 2011 and pitched to a 4.61 ERA in twenty-eight starts; a relatively respectable ERA for a twenty-three year old. However, over the next two years Britton seemed to regress, and found himself on the shuttle back-and-forth to Norfolk. Last season, in eight games for the Orioles Britton posted a 4.95 ERA, but it was\xc2\xa0the 17 walks to 18 strikeouts that\xc2\xa0were really concerning. He looked over-whelmed and out-of-place on the mound.However, Britton has been a different pitcher this spring. He looks physically stronger and his mechanics have been exceptionally more consistent. With his fastball consistently in the upper 90\xe2\x80\x99s and his slider looking sharp, Britton has pitched to an ERA of 0.84 in just under eleven innings. He has also increased his strikeouts ratio rate to over one an inning. It\xe2\x80\x99s a small sample size but there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying he has been impressive, and it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the spring he needed to force his way onto the roster.The Orioles have had success in recent years converting starters into relievers. Both Tommy Hunter and Brian Matusz struggled to find consistency as starters and eventually found themselves out of the rotation. However, in the bullpen, both pitchers saw significant increases in velocity and above all looked tremendously more confident. The Orioles could be seeing the same results this spring in Britton.\xc2\xa0With the additions of Ubaldo Jimenez and Suk-min Yoon, Britton probably never had a legitimate shot at the rotation; but with his impressive spring he could be a valuable member of the bullpen when the team heads north. It\xe2\x80\x99s still only March, but with his high-90\xe2\x80\x99s sinker, the Orioles may have found a useful late-innings power-arm.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThinking back just a few weeks, it was difficult to imagine how the Baltimore Orioles roster was going to be whittled down from a spring training camp with 62 names to a list of 25 to take north. Of course there were about 18 names as certainties, along with a host of others destined for AAA or AA while getting a big-league camp experience.And now four days before the opening game, it is down to a couple of decisions to be made. The starting rotation is set. And the outfield situation clarified itself after the decisions to send down Quintin Berry and Henry Urrutia, along with Nolan Reimold headed to the familiar DL. Urrutia will be back someday, and I pity the poor International League pitching he is going to ravage. And, as much as I really like Reimold and have been one of his bandwagon folks, wow, it is difficult to hold on.Still to be defined is this infield situation. Let\xe2\x80\x99s work back from where the Orioles hope to be a year from now \xe2\x80\xa6 and that would be with Manny Machado at third, J.J. Hardy (with contract extended) at short, Jonathan Schoop at second, and Chris Davis at first. That even looks good in print, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? The backup infielder would be the best of Ryan Flaherty or Steve Lombardozzi \xe2\x80\x93 based upon their 2014 performance.Working back from a month from now, where the O\xe2\x80\x99s hope to have Machado at third, the presumption would be Flaherty and Lombo at second \xe2\x80\xa6 that is, unless the Orioles decide to go for it now on making it happen with Schoop. It would seem to me that it fits the Baltimore pattern of behavior to delay the clock on young players and let them grow up at AAA, though advancing the timepiece worked with Machado.The other outstanding decision is clarifying the final two bullpen positions, where it seems to me that guys who strike out the side in final spring training games should be seriously considered \xe2\x80\x93 and they are. That would be Evan Meek \xe2\x80\x93 who earned a save against Boston by striking them out in the bottom of the 9th on nine consecutive pitchers! That boy deserves a bonus for doing that against the Red Sox \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if it was in a video game!The other was Josh Stinson, who gained six strikeouts in two innings last evening against the Rays \xe2\x80\xa6 although you have to also toss in three walks and his own throwing error (and a catcher\xe2\x80\x99s error) \xe2\x80\x93 all in the 9th inning.

03/28/2014,"[('Top 40 Orioles of All Time: #2, Brooks Robinson', ' #2 - Brooks Robinson, 3B  (1955-1977) When Stacey and I first tossed about the idea of doing this list, she asked me, ""Cal is #1, right?"" And yes, Cal is #1, but that\'s not because Brooks Robinson is any less of a great Oriole. Cal and Brooks are the greatest Orioles. That much is certain. The debate over which is the greatest can always be had.    For us, Cal is the one we got to see. Brooks is the one we heard about from our parents. There was a lot to hear about. Fifteen straight All-Star selections, sixteen consecutive Gold Gloves at third base. One Most Valuable Player award in 1964 and four more top five finishes. Two World Series championships over a 23-year Hall of Fame career. The Human Vacuum Cleaner, they called him, and still do. All future third base defense is compared against his gold standard. You know the legendary Brooks images. Leaping towards Dave McNally and Andy Etchebarren as the Orioles have clinched the 1966 World Series. He looks to be soaring so high it\'s like he\'s floating towards the clouds. Perhaps he was doing just that as the team won its first championship in the franchise\'s history. He was the runner-up for American League MVP that year, sandwiched between teammates Frank Robinson and Boog Powell in the voting. Maybe you\'ve heard about this one once or twice: Your browser does not support iframes. Great day in the morning! Sure, it was probably a slow runner, but my goodness. Two steps into foul territory and he fires the perfect strike. I\'ve heard about this play a hundred times and even seeing it, I still can\'t believe it. That was Brooks at age 33, over 2,000 games into his major league career. If he had that kind of range and arm strength into his 30s, I can only wonder what it must have been like to see him in the prime of his career.    What a career it was. The Orioles signed him out of Little Rock in 1955 and he made his big league debut - over six games - that very year. Most of his time was spent in the minors until 1958, when he played in 145 games at age 21. He only batted .238/.292/.305 that year and didn\'t show much of anything at the plate. A rough April in 1959 saw him demoted to Triple-A - Vancouver in those days, if you can believe it - and he didn\'t make it back to Baltimore until July.    That was a rough month, too, but he got things going in August and September of that year and never looked back. He played in only 88 games in 1959, but he\'d play in 144 or more every year after that until the 1976 season, winning a Gold Glove in every one of them. Watching him flash the leather above, it\'s easy to see why. The people who watched him play could see it right away, too: he came in third place in the MVP voting in that 1960 season, the first of seven top ten finishes. Brooks broke out for his MVP season in 1964, which also happened to be a great year for the Orioles. He was a big part of the team winning 97 games, which was only good for third place in that year\'s American League, though they were only two games back of first place New York.    Apparently, you didn\'t have to be on a playoff team to win MVP then. You just had to be really good, like .317/.368/.521 good, with 28 home runs and 118 runs driven in. That was good for 8.1 bWAR, a number that\'s only been topped in seven Orioles seasons in the 50 years since. One of those others was Brooks himself; three of them were Cal. This was the first of five MVP awards won by Orioles players to date. That kicked off a five-year stretch in which he had a better-than-league average OPS+ every season. Not surprisingly, three of these five years he finished in the top three of MVP voting. His 1964 season was his most superlative with the bat, but he was never as helpless with it as a player like Belanger. He finished with a .267/.322/.401 batting line over his career, and had ten seasons in which he batted at least league average. Add to that the kind of defense that let him pull off a play like he did against Lee May above and you\'ve got a player who was one of the best to ever step on a baseball field. Did you know that when Brooks was elected to Baseball\'s Hall of Fame in 1983, there were 30 writers of the 374 with ballots who did not vote for him? What sort of person sat there and thought, nope, not a Hall of Famer? There are always a few curmudgeons, but it certainly wasn\'t anti-PED crusading in those days. Too bad for them. He cruised in with about 92% of the ballots naming him.    I\'ve never met him - though he did cruise in a golf cart right past me one time - but we\'re on a first name basis. Maybe that\'s because it was the only way to differentiate him from Frank Robinson. I think there\'s more to it, though. Beyond just spending his whole career here, he felt like a part of everyone\'s lives, and he still does. He was a player for so long, then a broadcaster for a while. He even got his own Norman Rockwell painting. He is older now, soon to be 77, and any time he is in poor health, the whole community of Orioles fans is behind him. Brooks is part of the family. His statue stands with all the rest in Legends Plaza, and no matter what any fan of any other team might try to tell you, he\'s the greatest third baseman to ever play the game of baseball. My dad was lucky to get to see him play, and I\'m lucky I got to grow up hearing stories about him. #5 in his uniform, #2 in our list, he is Brooks Robinson, and he is an Oriole if there ever was one.

In that time, there has been plenty to celebrate. Jessica Kartalija takes a look back at some fans\xe2\x80\x99 fondest memories. For Orioles fans, it\xe2\x80\x99s a walk down memory lane. \xe2\x80\x9cI was at the Orioles first game ever, 1954, and I was seven-years-old,\xe2\x80\x9d Mike Gibbons said. Gibbons is executive director of Sports Legends Museum at Camden Yards. Like other Marylanders, he has fond memories of the team over the past six decades. Fans fondly recall watching Brooks Robinson play third base in the \xe2\x80\x9960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s, like the guys from 105.7 The Fan. \xe2\x80\x9cI was taken to a box and met one of my favorite all-time players from childhood,\xe2\x80\x9d Ed Norris said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was still stunned and awestruck and I will never forget it. That is my favorite moment.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cJuly 15, 1989. Go to the ninth inning, the Orioles are down 9-7. Larry Sheets comes up as pinch hitter and ties the game,\xe2\x80\x9d Steve Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then Mike Devereaux on a 1-1 count whacks one to left. It goes out, it\xe2\x80\x99s walkoff, game-winning home run. No one knows whether it\xe2\x80\x99s fair or foul, probably even to this day, but 47,000 fans went nuts. Now that was Oriole Magic.\xe2\x80\x9d Magic like the 2012 season, when the team went to the playoffs for the first time in 15 years. \xe2\x80\x9cGetting to go with my dad and brother, sitting there and taking it in the crowd. Just the energy at the stadium is always fun to be at,\xe2\x80\x9d Molly Crisp said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was 11-years-old. My mom took me to my first baseball game and it just so happened that was Opening Day,\xe2\x80\x9d Rob Long said. That was at Memorial Stadium, where the team played from 1954 until the early 90s. \xe2\x80\x9cOctober 6, 1991. After the game, all of the old Orioles came out on the field, made a circle and we took a 360-degree picture of them to use as an exhibit later on,\xe2\x80\x9d Gibbons said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the last-out ball at Memorial Stadium, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very special to our collection.\xe2\x80\x9d On September 6, 1995, when Cal Ripken broke Lou Gherig\xe2\x80\x99s record.

However in the fourth inning of last night\xe2\x80\x99s 4-3 loss to Tampa Nelson Cruz was hit on the bill of his helmet by an Alex Cobb off speed pitch. Obviously that and a pitcher being nailed by a comebacker are two of the scariest type of moments that baseball has to offer. However for all intents and purposes, it appears that the Orioles dodged a bullet. Cruz was taken to a local hospital and given a CT scan; he isn\xe2\x80\x99t expected to miss Opening Day on Monday.The O\xe2\x80\x99s finished Spring Training with a 13-9-4 record; and you have to figure that in at least three of those four ties the Orioles had the lead late, and ended up losing it. However according to manager Buck Showalter, the Birds accomplished everything that they were hoping to accomplish in Spring Training. As he told MASN\xe2\x80\x99s Roch Kubatko after last night\xe2\x80\x99s game, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6we\xe2\x80\x99re as ready as we can be.\xe2\x80\x9dIt\xe2\x80\x99s tough to judge how a team is going to do based on Spring Training records, because for theCourtest of David Manning-USA TODAY Sportsmost part the games don\xe2\x80\x99t really unfold the way a normal game would. Towards the end the manaers will normally let things go the way they would during the season, but other than that the games are almost scripted in terms of who pitches when and for how long. However Oriole fans should take a lot of hope based on the fact that the team looked very good in most of their spring games. And speaking of the fans, last night\xe2\x80\x99s game was the seventh sellout of the spring for the Orioles, who have really been embraced by the Sarasota community since moving their Spring Training headquarters there in 2010. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s fans coming down from the Baltimore area, local Sarasota people, or fans from far and wide who just want to take in a game, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have consistently drawn well in Sarasota. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve rewarded the fans that have come by having arguably the nicest facility in baseball.Following last night\xe2\x80\x99s game reliever Alfredo Aceves was informed that he was not going to make the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 25-man roster, and he\xe2\x80\x99s apparently going to opt out of his contract. The Birds signed Aceves to a minor league deal this past off season, however it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that he was expecting to be on the big league roster. The Orioles will remain in Sarasota to tie up loose ends today, and then are expected to formally break camp in a sense tomorrow when they board their team charter bound for Norfolk, VA as they get set to take on the Tides at 3 PM. However rain is expected in the Norfolk area tomorrow, so if the game ends up being rained out the Birds will remain in Sarasota awhile longer for a workout on Saturday.Buck Showalter will need to trim his active roster down to 25 by 3 PM Sunday, and he\xe2\x80\x99s expected to make his final cuts on Saturday in Norfolk. It makes sense if you think about it \xe2\x80\x93 most of those final cuts will be playing for the Tides anyways, so the O\xe2\x80\x99s might as well drop them off there! ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
03/29/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Buck stops here - Birds Watcher', 'We\xe2\x80\x99ve given a lot of time this spring to figuring out how various players would end up fitting onto the roster that the Baltimore Orioles have construed. However what can we continually make of what\xe2\x80\x99s above that roster? Namely, what do the Orioles have in the dugout? Buck Showalter is entering his fourth full season as the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 skipper; he also guided the team in the final two months of 2010. Does he give the Birds an advantage on the field or in the win/loss column? I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of opinion, and in reality it matters how you look at things.Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s biggest detractors point to how in the past he\xe2\x80\x99s done things in a\xc2\xa0my way or the highway\xc2\xa0type of manner. By in the past, I mean in previous managerial stints. Whether or not those days are truly over is another story. Look at things from the perspective of a company; if your supervisor gives you instruction, the\xc2\xa0my way or the highway\xc2\xa0mentality is somewhat implied. However that aside, Showalter also gets tagged with being overly loyal to players. Coming from an Italian family, loyalty is the quality that I admire the most. It\xe2\x80\x99s also worth mentioning that last season while Showalter was publically standing behind closer Jim Johnson in his nine blown saves, odds are he was counseling him a bit more severely behind closed doors. However that\xe2\x80\x99s the mark of a great leader; publically praise and privately scorn.Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s trademark in all of his managerial stops along the way has been his legendary attention to detail. There\xe2\x80\x99s no detail that goes unnoticed by Buck. When he took stewardship of the franchise in August of 2010, he paid a short side visit almost immediately to Ed Smith Stadium in Sarasota to see how the renovations were going (during a road trip to Tampa). Even before that, he spend two weeks prior to accepting the job scouting the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 minor league system to see what he would have to work with. Those qualities should tell fans and players alike what kind of attention to detail Buck Showalter pays.To his credit, Showalter is not an excuse maker. So often in society nowadays we\xe2\x80\x99re being taught to give and accept excuses on a regular basis. Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s attitude is that if you continually accept lame excuses, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to get lame excuses. So the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 payroll being less than that of New York and Boston is no excuse for losing. It\xe2\x80\x99s that attitude, as well as an aura of confidence, that gave the Orioles the self-discipline and the will they needed to stand up to the Yankees and Red Sox.The fact is that for the first time since the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, the Orioles have both a bona fide manager, and a roster of players that\xe2\x80\x99s poised to make a playoff run. As late as 2005, the Birds were in contention at the all-star break. However they never had a presence in the dugout that would have been necessary to take that next step in their progression.

Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY SportsThis is the third of a four-part Baltimore Orioles Preview package for the 2014 season. Two days ago I wrote HERE a negative perspective about all that could go terribly wrong this year, whereas yesterday I wrote HERE about how this could be the most incredible season. And now today I balance out what I believe is a most likely scenario of ups and downs \xe2\x80\x93 call them hopes and fears for the 2014 Orioles. And then I finish tomorrow with a short piece that projects the AL East.Having done this for a few years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve nicely hit a couple on the head \xe2\x80\x93 like pretty much predicting Davis\xe2\x80\x99 great season in 2013, but missed a few also \xe2\x80\x93 like saying it was crazy to put Manny Machado batting second in the order.In any event, it really is pretty foolish to put one\xe2\x80\x99s views out there for the whole world to see, since predicting baseball is about as accurate as trying to forecast the next winter\xe2\x80\x99s weather in September. But, here it goes \xe2\x80\xa6 and yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring these back again after the season in October to review what was right and what was wrong.The six core players for the Orioles will have a mixed bag of results, though in total they will be as strong as any top six players on any MLB team.a. Chris Davis will have a season that, in total, will be nearly as strong as 2013. He will have fewer homers and RBIs, but also fewer strikeouts, with also an improved batting average.b. Matt Wieters will continue his outstanding catching skills, having his best season ever with an improved Orioles pitching staff. His power numbers will be about the same, with his average a bit higher though not at the level hoped for a few years ago.c. J.J. Hardy will provide a solid year in all respects, with a slight decrease in average and homers.d. Adam Jones will have yet another season on par with recent years in all offensive categories, contributing as always as the soul and heartbeat of the team.e. Nick Markakis is going to have a tremendous comeback year, re-establishing power and hitting for an average as he did before the rash of injuries. The Orioles will either exercise the option for him for another year, or he will leave vindicated by the great season he had.f. Manny Machado will return from injury to begin play in late April. He will be a solid player, especially on defense, but the offseason of rehab will have him behind at the plate, and he will not recover offensively until 2015.The new additions in left field, designated hitter, second base, and backup catcher and utility players will make a huge offensive difference for the Orioles.a. The DH hole will produce among the top three in the AL between primarily Nelson Cruz and Delmon Young against lefties.b. David Lough will be an effective left fielder, especially defensively, and will produce offensively beyond expectations. He will become a fan favorite early in the season because of his hustle and aggressive play.c. Jonathan Schoop will have an effective first year and be more productive than anything else seen at second base in several years, though it will not be enough for something like Rookie of the Year. But he will establish himself as the second baseman for the upcoming number of years.d. Ryan Flaherty and Steve Lombardozzi will prove to be good utility players and occasional starters, while the Nolan Reimold health issue comes to a sad conclusion as simply unable to be resolved sufficiently.e. Steve Clevenger will be the best backup catcher the Orioles have had in years, and this will allow more time off for Wieters \xe2\x80\x93 helping Matt have a better year offensively.The Orioles bullpen will have an extremely effective year in total, and they will prove to be more like the pen of 2012 than 2013. This will be a key team strength that is managed well by Buck Showalter.a. Brian Matusz will be every bit as good against lefties as in the past, and he will provide some occasional long-relief innings that save the day in multiple games.b. Tommy Hunter will do a decent job in the closer\xe2\x80\x99s role, though Zach Britton will look so good in late innings set-up work that he will eventually flip positions with Hunter.c. Ryan Webb, Evan Meek, and Josh Stinson will all have very, very good seasons and consistent effectiveness.d. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day will have his poorest season as an Oriole, while Troy Patton will never pitch again for the O\xe2\x80\x99s.The starting rotation will be improved over 2013, though still prove to be the weakness of the team.a. Chris Tillman will not be as good as 2013, though still a worthy part of the rotation.b. Whereas Ubaldo Jimenez will have some good games, he may well have difficulty particularly against AL East teams \xe2\x80\x93 struggling there with pitch counts that work against him and an inability to finish off hitters.c. Wei-Yin Chen and Bud Norris will struggle with inconsistency, while Miguel Gonzalez will provide strong four and five-inning starts to games, with difficulties getting deeper into the 6th and 7th frames.d. Kevin Gausman will be the most effective starter for the Orioles in the second half of the season.e. Suk-min Yoon will not prove to be particularly effective either at Norfolk or Baltimore. Dylan Bundy will make progress, though not enough to help the Orioles this year.f. The season will end with the certainty of a very different rotation expected for the 2015 season.Overall the Baltimore Orioles are an improved team in every department beyond the 2012 and 2013 versions, and this translates into a significant win total.I am slow to make statements such as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Orioles will go as far as their starting pitching takes them\xe2\x80\x9d as that does not seem terribly insightful to me. There is not a team in baseball that would not make the same statement. It is the nature of the game. Most teams have rotation concerns.Over recent years I have tracked seasonally with the Orioles in a simple chart I keep about what part of the team either most caused them to lose or win a game. And though one would expect it to be the starting pitching, in actuality, the Orioles drop more games because of ineffective situational hitting than they do the starters putting them into a deep hole. And in 2013, the bullpen was a huge problem, particularly that fellow wearing the yellow and green now, which is why I do not grieve his loss. Save statistics are among the most worthless of baseball numbers, in my view.So, having said that, I believe the upgrades at 2B, LF, and DH particularly, are going to make enough of a difference that the bullpen will be in far fewer critical save situations than over the past two years.

Every time, Verlander has helped pitch them into the American League Championship Series.Yet in all those years, the Tigers have won just one World Series game, in 2006. Verlander, 31, is signed through 2019 and can afford to take the long view. The lack of a title does not pain him.\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I wait a few more years, next thing you know I\xe2\x80\x99m 36 and came close to it a bunch of times and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite able to get it, then I think it would start to feel like more of a void.

The Tigers traded the reliable starter Doug Fister to Washington for a package led by Robbie Ray, a pitcher with just 11 games above Class A.

Of course. They have three aces, including Anibal Sanchez, and the game\xe2\x80\x99s best hitter in Miguel Cabrera, who just signed a contract through 2023. But they have lost shortstop Jose Iglesias and reliever Bruce Rondon to season-ending injuries, and two of their most important players, outfielder Torii Hunter and closer Joe Nathan, will be 39 by the end of the All-Star break. Improved Royals Are LurkingIn the Central Division, the Tigers will have all they can handle from the Kansas City Royals, who went 86-76 last season, their best record since 1994. The Royals should reach base more often, with Norichika Aoki and Omar Infante added at the top of the order, and the rookie Yordano Ventura could have a major effect on the rotation.

But remember that the Royals went 43-27 in the second half, essentially matching the Tigers (43-27) and the Cleveland Indians (41-26).

But he went 11-14 otherwise, mainly because of atrocious defense and the A.L.\xe2\x80\x99s worst offense.

But do not be surprised if the Baltimore Orioles turn out to be the best team in the league. In an era of declining offense, their overpowering lineup is a difference maker.Three A.L. teams scored more runs last season than Baltimore: the division-winning Red Sox, the Tigers and the Athletics. The Orioles led the majors in home runs by far, and now they add the All-Star Nelson Cruz to the middle of their order.

Puskar/Associated Press           Cruz was suspended last summer as part of the Biogenesis doping investigation. But his addition gives Baltimore five everyday players who hit at least 22 homers last season.

East. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers may not measure up to the rest of the division on the surface, but five everyday players have won Gold Gloves in the last three seasons. Manager Buck Showalter and the pitching coach, Dave Wallace, are skilled at manipulating pitchers\xe2\x80\x99 roles.The Orioles have five solid starters, led by Ubaldo Jimenez. But they also have two elite prospects \xe2\x80\x94 Dylan Bundy (recovering from Tommy John elbow surgery) and Kevin Gausman \xe2\x80\x94 who could contribute this season. If Johan Santana has anything left in his surgically repaired shoulder, the Orioles will get it. Suk-min Yoon, a right-hander signed from South Korea, may also help.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles are far from perfect. Third baseman Manny Machado, who led the league in doubles and defensive wins above replacement (as calculated by baseball-reference.com), will miss the start of the season while recovering from knee surgery. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s long-term outlook is clouded by the service time of Davis and catcher Matt Wieters, who are both clients of the agent Scott Boras and can be free agents after the 2015 season.Like many teams, then, the Orioles are squarely in a win-now stretch. Their A.L. neighbors Tampa Bay, New York, Texas, Detroit and Boston have reached the World Series within the last six years. Although some of those teams may have peaked, the Orioles and their prime-age core could be better than what we have recently seen.\xe2\x80\x9cEver since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of guys at the same stage of their careers, the same age, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to keep a lot of us together,\xe2\x80\x9d Wieters said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very rare to have so many guys from 25 to 31 on the team. More than anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice for all the players because we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through very similar stages in our career.\xe2\x80\x9dNow they have a better chance than you might think to reach the brightest stage in baseball, a place not visited by the Orioles in 31 years: the World Series.

Those signings turned the Orioles from off season losers to big time winners. Whereas previously the story of the off season was the Grant Balfour situation, afterwards it turned into how much beefier the rotation looked, and how much more opponents might now fear the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 already potent lineup with the likes of Nelson Cruz. But will this translate to wins and losses on the field?If you\xe2\x80\x99re going for overall wins and losses, Nelson Cruz \xc2\xa0had a WAR of 2.2 in 2013 and UbaldoCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsJimenez stood at 2.7. So doing some rough math, that\xe2\x80\x99s five wins that the Orioles picked up based on those signings \xe2\x80\x93 which would put the O\xe2\x80\x99s at 90 wins based on last season. Is that enough to make the post season? Let\xe2\x80\x99s not get ahead of ourselves, as we only now sit on the eve of Opening Day. However as has been the case in the past, the Orioles will sink or swim this season based on their pitching. Granted it begins with starting pitching, however it also dips into the bullpen as well.The O\xe2\x80\x99s of course traded closer Jim Johnson to Oakland, and Tommy Hunter is going to be the primary closer. Questions about the bullpen will linger throughout the first few weeks of the season, or until the \xe2\x80\x98pen proves that it can mow down opposing batters. With that said, the success and/or failure of the 2014 season might well lie in one-run games. In 2012 (a playoff year) the Birds were an amazing 29-9 in one run games. Last season (where they just missed qualifying for the post season) they were 10-21 \xe2\x80\x93 do the math. In a division like the AL East, those one run games will be a huge deciding factor. That in and of itself is why the performance of the aforementioned Hunter, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Zach Britton, Brian Matusz, et al, is of great importance.However wins and losses often begin and end with starting pitching. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 rotation looksCourtesy of Douglas Jones-USA TODAY Sportsmuch different than even five years ago, when it was anchored on Opening Day by Kevin Millwood. However with the addition of the aforementioned Jimenez, the Birds now have two bona fide ace-type pitchers at the front of the rotation. And when you throw in Wei-Yin Chen, Miguel Gonzalez, and Bud Norris, the O\xe2\x80\x99s appear to be in decent shape top-to-bottom in terms of their starters. This of course presumes that the likes of Tillman and company produce what they have in the past, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to think that they won\xe2\x80\x99t. (Incidentally that\xe2\x80\x99s true of every team in the league; if Derek Jeter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t produce as he has in the past he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to have a good season.) However the key for the starters is once again going to be going deeper into games; if the bullpen has to pick up the slack for half of games down the stretch, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a long season and someone\xe2\x80\x99s arm might fall off.The least of most people\xe2\x80\x99s concerns is offense and the defense behind the starting pitchers. The Orioles have a potent offensive lineup with the likes of Adam Jones, Nick Markakis, Nelson Cruz, and of course Chris Davis. Defensively the Orioles had a historically good year in 2013, and again there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to think that trend won\xe2\x80\x99t continue. However the wild card of course is the fact that Manny Machado will start the season on the DL. When he returns, will he be up to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to expect? That of course remains to be seen, however I suspect that Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette won\xe2\x80\x99t rush Machado back, especially knowing that second and third base are in good hands with Ryan Flaherty and Steve Lombardozzi.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 25-man roster has been finalized, and I suppose the big news is that JonathanCourtesy of Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY SportsSchoop not only made the team, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance he might be in the Opening Day lineup. Speaking for myself, this was almost a formality, as based on his performance I felt that they had no choice but to bring him north. T.J. McFarland was also optioned to Norfolk yesterday, along with Jermile Weeks and Kevin Gausman. All of them are still on the 40-man roster, so they could be in Baltimore at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. Even Meeks will probably get the slot McFarland filled in terms of being the long man in the \xe2\x80\x98pen moving forward.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are once again poised to contend for a playoff spot in 2014. So where do they finish, and with how many wins? It really matters who you ask; Vegas says forth place and 78 wins. However CBS\xe2\x80\x99 Jon Heyman predicted the Orioles to finish first in the AL East for the first time since 1997. Ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that neither the Orioles or anyone else is going to finish 162-0 \xe2\x80\x93 or 0-162 for that matter. I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking\xe2\x80\xa6REALLY Vadala, you\xe2\x80\x99re predicting them to finish somewhere between 162-0 and 0-162?!\xc2\xa0Something like that, I suppose. However let\xe2\x80\x99s be a bit more specific. I think that Chris Tillman will continue his progression, and become the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first twenty-game winner in years. Will Chris Davis hit another 53 homers? Probably not, however the O\xe2\x80\x99s will now also have another 25-30 homers built into their lineup with the likes of Nelson Cruz. So what\xe2\x80\x99s my prediction in terms of wins and losses? I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do this because I\xe2\x80\x99m not big on taking risks \xe2\x80\x93 but count me as being in the Jon Heyman camp\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with somewhere in the neighborhood of 90 wins.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Grady Sizemore will never forget his first opening day with the Boston Red Sox.His teammates, however, can\'t wait to put the memory of the game behind them.The defending World Series champion Red Sox failed to capitalize on several scoring opportunities, and a home run by Sizemore wasn\'t enough to prevent a 2-1 loss to the Baltimore Orioles on Monday.After missing two seasons recovering from knee surgery, Sizemore marked his return from a 922-day absence with a second-inning single for his first hit since September 2011. The three-time All-Star for Cleveland later hit his first homer since July 15, 2011, which also came at Camden Yards.""Today was very exciting,"" Sizemore said. ""I couldn\'t wait to get to the ballpark.""The single was particularly gratifying, because it came on his first at-bat.""Having gone through what I\'ve gone through, it was nice to get that moment,"" Sizemore said.His homer created a 1-1 tie in the fourth inning, but that would be the extent of the Boston offense. The Red Sox got nine hits and drew three walks, but they stranded 12 and went 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position.""There were a lot of opportunities that we did create but didn\'t cash in,"" manager John Farrell said. ""The two-out hit was elusive.""Second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who went 2 for 5, added, ""We just hit the ball right at people. It was one of those deals where we couldn\'t find a way to push runs across.""Nelson Cruz homered off Jon Lester (0-1) in the seventh inning to put the Orioles up 2-1. Cruz hit 27 homers last year with Texas during a season marred by a 50-game suspension from Major League Baseball in the Biogenesis drug scandal.""It was really neat, it was special,"" he said. ""I made the right call to come and be part of this organization, be part of this town.""Zach Britton (1-0) got the win with two scoreless innings of relief and Tommy Hunter got three outs for the save. Hunter earned the job as closer this spring after the Orioles dealt away Jim Johnson during the offseason.The Red Sox got two on with one out in the ninth before World Series MVP David Ortiz hit a flyball and Jackie Bradley Jr. took a called third strike.Making his fourth straight opening day start for Boston, Lester gave up two runs, six hits and a walk in seven innings. He struck out eight.""It was good. Obviously, the only thing better would be if we win,"" the left-hander said. ""Other than that I thought I threw the ball well.""Orioles starter Chris Tillman allowed one run, seven hits and a walk in five innings. The right-hander went 3-1 against Boston last year, but in this one he needed 104 pitches to get 15 outs.Britton gave up a one-out double to Xander Bogaerts in the sixth and got three straight outs in the seventh, the only time all day that Boston went down in order.Evan Meek walked two in the eighth before Brian Matusz retired A.J. Pierzynski on a comebacker.Gametime temperature was announced at 60 degrees, but a stiff wind chilled many in the crowd of 46,685 \xe2\x80\x94 the 23rd consecutive opening day sellout at Camden Yards.Hopeful that the offseason acquisitions of Cruz and right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez will enable Baltimore to return to the playoffs after missing out last year, Orioles fans were out in force. Until recently, games against Boston often drew as many Red Sox backers as those rooting for the home team.""Our crowd was legit,"" Hunter said. ""That was awesome. I hope they come out like that every game for 80 more here.""The Orioles used a walk, a single by Matt Wieters and a double-play grounder to take a 1-0 lead in the second.The Red Sox put runners at second and third with two outs in the third before Tillman struck out Mike Carp. In the fourth, Sizemore hit a 3-1 pitch over the right field wall.NOTES: Pedroia got Boston\'s first hit of the season, a one-out single in the first inning, to extend his hitting streak on opening day to eight games. ...

', 'www.usatoday.com'), (""Baltimore Orioles: Season's Greetings - Birds Watcher"", 'Mar 15, 2014; Sarasota, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles right fielder Nick Markakis (21) at bat against the New York Yankees at Ed Smith Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsSeason\xe2\x80\x99s greetings, baseball fans. The long winter has finally thawed (though we saw some snow in the Baltimore/Washington area yesterday) and baseball has finally begun. Opening Day is like Christmas for seamheads all over the world, and with this special holiday in mind, I made a Christmas wish list for the 2014 Orioles. With a team that appears to be on the cusp of potentially great things this year, a few nice gifts could make the difference between a season where the team finishes around .500 and a season where the team is in contention for an AL East crown and possibly a World Series berth.Nick Markakis ReboundStatistically, Nick Markakis was one of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 worst offensive players last year, posting a career-worst OPS of .685. He was also the highest paid Oriole. That is not a good combination. In 2014, Markakis needs to be the producer he once was. With nearly 20 pounds of muscle added in the offseason, a rebound season for Markakis could give the Orioles a versatile hitter they could bat anywhere from first to sixth. An uptick in Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 power and a rediscovery of his ability to simply get on-base would make the Orioles possibly the most formidable lineup in the American League.Ryan Flaherty BreakoutRyan Flaherty will begin the season as the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starting third baseman until Manny Machado returns, when he would either fall in to a starting second base or utility role. Regardless of his eventual role, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good possibility that Flaherty will see a significant number of at-bats in an Orioles uniform this year. The Orioles hope that the same Ryan Flaherty that hit for a serviceable .240-plus average and 10 home runs in the second half of 2013 shows-up instead of the guy that barely exceeded a .100 average for the first two months of the year. If Flaherty continues to track upward and replicates his second-half numbers, he could provide surprising pop and production at the back end of the lineup to accompany his valuable glove.Matt Wieters OBP IncreaseMatt Wieters was not a good hitter last year. If you subtract a few feet from his some of his 22 fence-clipping home runs in 2014, Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 offensive production was just downright bad. A key to the Orioles improving on their below-average .313 team on-base percentage will be Wieters improving on his abysmal .287 figure.Chris Davis ContractThe obscene 10 year/$292 million deal signed by Miguel Cabrera earlier last week seems to reduce the possibility that Chris Davis will sign an extension with the Orioles. Most people doubt the Orioles willingness to sign any player to a contract of that length or that value. Davis seems primed for a great 2014 season, even if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t replicate his historic 2013. His price isn\xe2\x80\x99t going down. If the Orioles want to keep Davis beyond next year, a deal needs to get done before the price rises further. Hopefully, it\xe2\x80\x99s a deal that won\xe2\x80\x99t commit the Orioles to 10 years like the Cabrera contract \xe2\x80\x93 10 years is far too long for a guaranteed contract \xe2\x80\x93 but Davis needs to\xc2\xa0 be here. There\xe2\x80\x99s no other power threat like him in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 system, and only a few in all of baseball.Manny Machado RecoveryThe Orioles and Machado are doing the right thing by taking a patient approach with the recovery of the third baseman\xe2\x80\x99s knee. The last thing the Orioles need is to jeopardize their future and slow a star\xe2\x80\x99s progression by letting Manny play to early. Redskins fans know the risk there. When Manny comes back, the Orioles need him to be the same solid defensive player he was and his comfort moving side-to-side plays a big factor in that.Healthy Johan SantanaA healthy Johan Santana could be a tremendous mid-season boost to an Orioles pitching staff that already seems stacked with consistent, if not spectacular pitchers. In a best case scenario, the Orioles would be able to stash Santana in the minor leagues making rehab starts until he\xe2\x80\x99s needed to replace one of the team\xe2\x80\x99s original five starters or serve as another lefty in the bullpen. Santana also has playoff experience, which pairs well with his versatility and makes him a qualified candidate for the postseason roster if needed.Pitching Prospect ProgressionKevin Gausman and Dylan Bundy are future of the Orioles. This is the year that their impact will begin to be felt throughout the AL East. The two young pitching studs taking the next step toward stardom could give the Orioles the flexibility to replace struggling members of the rotation or bullpen with either of these aces-in-waiting. Even though Gausman will begin the season in AAA and Bundy will continue to rehab from Tommy John surgery, expect both to contribute to the Orioles at some point this season.Ubaldo Jimenez ConsistencyAs with Flaherty, the Orioles are hoping for the Jimenez that showed up in the second half of 2013 as opposed to the first half, or previous year, for that matter. When he\xe2\x80\x99s on his game, Jimenez has proven that he can be one of the more dominant in the game. Repeating his complicated delivery and controlling his electric stuff will be key for Jimenez in 2014.Tommy Hunter Improving SplitsLeft-handed batters hit nearly .300 against presumed new Orioles closer Tommy Hunter in 2013. If Hunter wants to hold the ninth-inning duties in 2014, the progression he showed with his off-speed pitches in spring training needs to carry over to the regular season and give him another weapon against southpaws.Hope everyone in Birdland has a wonderful day. For those heading to the game \xe2\x80\x94 travel safe, avoid traffic, get there early and be loud! Some encouraging words: the Orioles are 11-3 on Opening Day since 2000. Let\xe2\x80\x99s put one in the WIN column today. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Top 40 Orioles of All Time: #1, Cal Ripken, Jr. - Camden Chat', ' #1 - Cal Ripken, Jr., SS/3B (1981-2001) An entire generation of baseball fans, myself included, grew up thinking that baseball and Cal Ripken were basically the same thing. When Ripken began his consecutive games streak on May 30, 1982, I was three years old. I may have not even been aware that baseball was a thing. And when his streak came to an end on September 20, 1998, I was a sophomore in college. I was 19 years old before I ever saw an Orioles game without Cal Ripken. It\'s crazy, if you think about it.    Yes, Ripken\'s streak of 2,632 consecutive games is the thing that he is remembered most for in his Hall of Fame career. By the end it had grown into something uncontrollable, I think. But Ripken never intended for it to start in the first place. He was just a really, really good baseball player. The kind that any manager would want in the lineup every single day. Ripken was drafted in the second round of the 1978 amateur draft by the Orioles. The Orioles had two picks before they got to him. In the first round they drafted someone named Robert Boyce, a third baseman who never made it past A ball. Earlier in the second round, they drafted Larry Sheets. The draft is a funny thing. The first part of Ripken\'s career was rather charmed. He was called up in August 1981 after a strike by MLB came to an end, and played on a team that came within one game of going to the playoffs. Then in 1982 the Orioles won 94 games, Ripken took home Rookie of the Year honors, and they again fell just one game short of the playoffs. And in his third year, 1983, the Orioles won the World Series and Ripken was named A.L. Most Valuable Player. He must have thought that baseball was always going to be like that, winning awards and playing every season with the postseason on the line.    It wasn\'t, of course. As the Orioles went from perennial contender to basement dwellers in the 1980s, Cal Ripken continued on as one of the best players in baseball. From 1984-1991 the Orioles finished above fourth place just once (the miracle 1989 season), but it wasn\'t because of Cal. In those five seasons he hit .277/.352/.462 and became something rarely seen in baseball at that time: a power-hitting shortstop. In his first ten years in baseball he hit 259 home runs and 340 doubles, and in 1991 he put up one of the best seasons in Orioles history, and easily the best year of his career.    Maybe Cal wanted to send Memorial Stadium out in style, since 1991 was the last year of the old ballpark. In addition to playing the absolutely stellar defense that he put up his entire career, Cal hit had 210 hits on the year including 34 home runs and 46 doubles. So good was his all-around play that he was voted the league MVP despite the fact that his team won just 67 games. As you\'re probably aware, that hardly ever happens. But there was just no denying his amazing season. In addition to the MVP he was awarded the Gold Glove and the Silver Slugger. FanGraphs calculates that Cal\'s 1991 season was worth 10.6 WAR, the highest single season total in Orioles history (The top three seasons all belong to Cal). Despite being one of the best defensive shortstops in baseball, the 1991 Gold Glove was the first awarded to Ripken in his career. Other shortstops were flashier, diving all over the field and thus outshined Cal in the voting. But those who watched him every day knew exactly how good he was on defense. At 6\'4"" and 200+ pounds, it wasn\'t Cal\'s style to make a lot of dives. He didn\'t need to anyway, because he knew so much about every hitter on other teams and about every pitcher on his team that he was almost always perfectly positioned if the ball was hit his way. It\'s easy for your defense to go unheralded when every play you make looks like an easy ground ball. And his arm was so strong that he could play deep in the hole if needed and still make a strong throw to first base.    It turned out that 1991 was kind of Cal\'s swan song as far as offense goes. He continued to get on base at a decent clip but his power began to wane as he played into his thirties. Could it be that playing every single day sapped his strength? Who knows. But even with a less prolific bat, Cal was still a very valuable player thanks to the high level of defense he played. In 1996, Cal was back in the playoffs for the first time since he caught the last out of the 1983 World Series. He was on fire in the ALDS against the Cleveland Indians, going 8-for-18 with three doubles. He was less productive in the ALCS, although he did have two two-hit games. In 1997 he was hot for the duration of the playoffs, despite a below average showing at the plate in the regular season. He went 7-for-16 with two doubles and two walks in the ALDS against Seattle, and in the ALCS against Cleveland he had eight hits, including two doubles and a home run, and he walked four times. Sadly for both Cal and for all of us Orioles fans, he couldn\'t hit the team into the World Series. As is true with so many baseball players, Cal Ripken probably should have retired a few seasons earlier than he did. He lasted until 2001 in an Orioles uniform. His last game at Camden Yards was supposed to be September 23, 2001, but on account of the terrorist attacks the schedule had to be rearranged and he actually played his last home game on October 6th. I was at the game on September 23rd, having spent more money than I could afford on the tickets when I thought it was my last chance to see him. The Orioles were a mess in 2001, but Cal sent the crowd home happy with the very last home run of his career (#431, if you\'re counting). On his actual last day, he went 0-for-3 and the game ended with him on deck.    Baseball has never seen a player quite like Cal Ripken, and probably never will again. He played in 2,632 consecutive games, shattering the previously held record of 2,130. He went to 19 straight All Star games, 16 of which he was elected into by the fans. He won two MVPs, eight Silver Sluggers, and one Rookie of the Year Award. His final season was celebrated by all of baseball as every team he visited gave him going away presents and opposing crowds gave standing ovations. He was elected into the Orioles Hall of Fame in 2003 and the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame in in 2007 with 98.5% of the vote. He is one of the greatest shortstops in baseball history and the #1 Oriole of all time.

We\'ll still provide some matchup numbers, just for fun, but since they\'re not really predictive, we\'re trying to de-emphasize those.    That said, if you have a suggestion for what you\'d like to see in future preview articles, leave us a note in the comments! We appreciate the feedback. Monday, 31 March: Chris Tillman vs. Jon Lester    2013 Stats Tillman Lester   IP 206.1 213.1   ERA 3.71 3.75   FIP 4.42 3.59   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .241/.303/.427 .253/.314/.389     Chris Tillman gets the Opening Day nod for the 2014 season after putting together a very good 2013. While his .269 BABIP and 80.5% strand rate are likely not sustainable, Tillman has also managed to increase his strikeout rate over the last few years: 16.0% in \'11, 19.0% in \'12, and 21.2% in \'13. The league-average strikeout rate in 2013 was 19.9%. If Tillman\'s improvement in that regard holds - and it\'ll need to if he\'s to have the kind of results he did last year - the O\'s just might have a reliable starter with an above-average strikeout rate, something they\'ve sorely lacked for the last several years.    Lester is all too familiar to Baltimore fans, as he\'s thrown over 150 career innings against the Orioles while keeping his ERA under three. He throws four- and two-seam fastballs about half of the time, with cutters making up another quarter or so of his pitches, and the remainder are mostly curveballs and the occasional changeup. The cutter and curve see a lot more use when he\'s ahead in the count or has two strikes, while the changeup is just there to keep righties guessing.    Maybe hot: Nelson Cruz (1.409 OPS, 24 PA), Shane Victorino (1.053 OPS, 12 PA) Likely not: Chris Davis (.526 OPS, 26 PA), David Ortiz (.313 OPS, 20 PA)    Wednesday, 2 April: Ubaldo Jimenez vs. John Lackey    2013 Stats Jimenez Lackey   IP 182.2 189.1   ERA 3.30 3.52   FIP 3.43 3.86   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .239/.317/.367 .247/.290/.413     Jimenez is certainly going to be interesting to watch over the course of his contract. Hopefully, it won\'t be ""interesting"" in this sense. Rather than rehashing the many articles discussing Jimenez\'s rocky career, let\'s take a look at the new Oriole\'s repertoire. Jimenez is mostly a fastball-splitter guy, though he started throwing his slider a lot more in 2013. There\'s a good chance he tries to continue that going forward, since it may have contributed to his renewed success last year. He likes to use his sinker early in the count or when behind, but saves his four-seam fastball for when he\'s ahead or has two strikes. He\'ll also throw first-pitch sliders to righties nearly half of the time, while generally saving the splitter for lefties, against whom he\'ll throw it in any count. Lackey came back after losing 2012 to injury and had a solid season for Boston in 2013, posting a career-low walk rate and his highest strikeout rate since 2006. He\'s a fastball pitcher first and foremost, throwing four-seamers roughly half of the time. Against righties, he rarely uses anything except the fastball or his slider, while he mixes in a curve more often against lefties.    Maybe hot: Chris Davis (1.073 OPS, 32 PA), Jonny Gomes (1.417 OPS, 14 PA) Likely not: Matt Wieters (.333 OPS, 30 PA) Thursday, 3 April: Felix Doubront vs. Wei-Yin Chen    2013 Stats Chen Doubront   IP 137.0 162.1   ERA 4.07 4.32   FIP 4.04 3.78   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .272/.321/.440 .261/.338/.391     Chen lost some time to injury last season, but otherwise was pretty similar to the 2012 version: an average starter with modest strikeout rates, good control, and flyball tendencies that he usually gets away with. He did manage to cut down on his homer rate in \'13 (11.7 -> 9.9 HR/FB%), despite allowing even more flyballs (37.1 -> 34.4 GB%). Chen isn\'t flashy, but is a steal for the O\'s so far, as he\'s making just over $4M this year and could be an Oriole again next year for $4.75M. Ideally, sure, he\'s not your #3 starter, but young, competent, cost-controlled pitching is valuable, regardless of whether the guy\'s a home-grown prospect or an international free agent. I always forget about Doubront when thinking about Boston\'s pitching, even though he\'s started more than fifty games for them over the past two seasons. Like Lackey, he throws four-seam fastballs about half of the time, especially on the first pitch of an at-bat or when behind in the count.

Yes, the opening day of baseball season \xe2\x80\x93 the best day of the year.Some people actually like winter and cold and snow and ice. I know it is true, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll never understand it. As a child, I remember the first warmer days of spring and taking my baseball glove to school as the revival of hope that, yes, I was no longer locked up in a house! If you think about it, any weather that prevents playing baseball is bad weather! (Although truthfully, some of the coldest days of my life have been on a baseball field early in the season. I remember pitching in a college game in northern Pennsylvania and being unable to see my right fielder for several minutes \xe2\x80\x93 since he was completely engulfed in a white-out snow squall!)Yes, spring is a season of hope and new life. Everyone begins with a record of 0-0 and all things seem possible. And with the Baltimore Orioles opening day, hopes are renewed again. Is it reasonable to have hope? I certainly think so. Could the Orioles actually win the AL East? Yes, it is possible, even if we admit that it is a tough thing to do in the best division in the game. Could they finish dead last in the AL East? I suppose it is possible, though less likely than the former \xe2\x80\x93 but maybe so many things could go wrong that it happens.But hope is reasonable, no matter what the naysayers and alleged baseball experts around the country write about the Orioles. Dissing the Birds is an annual rite of spring \xe2\x80\x93 almost like sightings of the first robins in the yard. It will happen.From just two years ago this week, at the beginning of a season where the Orioles finished 93-69, here are three samples of well-known baseball prognosticators\xe2\x80\x99 pre-season writings about that Baltimore team \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Orioles are such a bungled mess that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t called them anything other than the OriLOLes for months.\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Orioles are still a directionless team with less-than-competent management and a meddling owner.

It\xe2\x80\x99ll be at least a decade before they are able to come out.Can you believe that? These are guys who got paid to write that stuff. So, after two very good seasons, it is certainly reasonable to at least project the Orioles as a serious contender, in spite of the continuous drivel about the weakness of the starting rotation.Let me put it this way for you. There is no doubt that this 2013 team is an upgrade over the past two years. If we take the last 350 regular season games from the end of August of 2011 to the end of last year, here would be the results \xe2\x80\xa6Tampa Bay\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 198-152New York\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 194-156Baltimore\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 192-158Boston\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 173-177Toronto\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 160-190That is encouraging, and it is not something most baseball fans would expect to see \xe2\x80\x93 particularly that the New York Yankees have only won two more games than the Orioles over the past 350 regular season contests.As more proof as to how far the Orioles have come, let\xe2\x80\x99s compare this year\xe2\x80\x99s opening lineup with that of just four years ago in 2010 (I have to take a guess on the exact lineup at the time that I write this).Position20102014PitcherKevin MillwoodChris TillmanCatcherMatt WietersMatt WietersFirst BaseGarrett AtkinsChris DavisSecond BaseBrian RobertsJonathan SchoopThird BaseMiguel TejadaRyan FlahertyShortstopCesar IzturisJ.J.

Schoop would be the first rookie second baseman for the Orioles since Rich Dauer in 1977, and the youngest rookie starting the opener since some guy wearing #8 started at shortstop in 1982.Lester is 15-3 lifetime against the Orioles, though the Birds got to him pretty good last year. And Nelson Cruz is 10-for-22 with two homers against him. Delmon Young is only 7-for-34 with no extra-base hits, and Steve Pearce is 1-for-8 \xe2\x80\xa6 so yes, Lester is tough.

The Orioles defeated the Red Sox 2-1. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsYou have to love the humanity of Buck Showalter. While being a great baseball guy who is sorting hundreds of pieces of baseball information in his brain, he is also quick to look around and capture the moment. After the opening day for the Baltimore Orioles, he spoke of how special it was for he himself; but he reflected as well on the meaning of it for some of the others \xe2\x80\x93 like Jonathan Schoop who made the team and started in this first home game.Buck also made an especially good point about what must have been the internal emotions for Evan Meek, who has not pitched since July 24, 2012.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are little moments like Evan Meek getting on the mound,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo years ago, people thought his career was over. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think he had some juice flying around today. \xe2\x80\xa6 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see Evan get nothing but better.\xe2\x80\x9dMeek managed to get two outs in the 8th inning, but he was clearly not as effective as in his spring training appearances.\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of these guys, it\xe2\x80\x99s just getting this outing out of the way. You saw the velocity and everything this spring compared to today, there\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say tightness, but your want-to is so much it kind of gets in the way a little bit.\xe2\x80\x9dShowalter has in past years made a concerted effort to get everyone into a game as soon as possible, in order to get that behind them and settle into the season. So, I would suspect we may well see some different players for game two, particularly in the bullpen choices \xe2\x80\x93 like Josh Stinson, Ryan Webb, and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day. And with the right-handed offerings of John Lackey, perhaps Buck might even give Steve Lombardozzi a shot at second base?Definitely making his first Orioles appearance will be Ubaldo Jimenez. The former Indians and Rockies pitcher has had major periods of both ups and downs in his career. Of course the Orioles are hoping to see the guy who was so extraordinary at the end of the 2013 season. This really should be a prime time of his career; and now on a team with strong hitting and defense, he should be able to just throw the ball and trust his stuff in order to have success.But in his somewhat limited experiences against the Red Sox and the AL East, success has been difficult to come by. The numbers are not good against many of the Boston hitters or in his appearances against the Sox. But the sample size is small, and in light of this entirely new experience in Baltimore, those numbers are definitely in the \xe2\x80\x9capples to oranges\xe2\x80\x9d category. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99 spring season was not quite as long as some of the others, so a long outing in this first appearance may not be in the cards. Six effective innings would be great, though five may be more realistic on this occasion.The Orioles will be going against John Lackey, who is coming off a 10-13 season with a 3.52 ERA over 189 innings. He did not have a stellar spring training however, as he gave up 24 hits in 18.2 innings with a 6.27 ERA.Chris Davis and Nick Markakis have hit Lackey well over the years, and Adam Jones has three homes in 44 plate appearances. But J.J. Hardy and Matt Wieters are both only .167 against him.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('It starts with pitching for the Baltimore Orioles', 'For years and years\xe2\x80\xa6and years, the Baltimore Orioles struggled to find pitching that could make it through games. And by that, I mean both starting and relief pitching. There were years where we wondered if someone\xe2\x80\x99s arm was going to fall out in the bullpen, and games in which we wondered if the Birds would simply run out of pitching. That\xe2\x80\x99s one reason that Dan Duquette has been willing to bring anyone and everyone who was willing into camp for a shot at the bigs. Think about it; a year ago would you have predicted that Josh Stinson and Evan Meeks would have been on this year\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Day roster? A year before that would you have thought that Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day would become a staple in the bullpen?Not all of the players that have come in have worked out, however it\xe2\x80\x99s the old theory that if you throw enough mud on the wall some of it is going to stick. However backing up for a moment, what was the problem with the Orioles for all of those years? It\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to say that they simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the guns in the rotation and in the \xe2\x80\x98pen by virtue of the fact that they drafted poorly (for years) and they weren\xe2\x80\x99t willing to develop what talent they did have. However that\xe2\x80\x99s the easy way out; the O\xe2\x80\x99s did have some talent in the organization at various points along the way. However what talent they did have (ie-Daniel Cabrera) wasn\xe2\x80\x99t willing to put in the work to harness that talent, and ultimately they were afraid of failure.Yeah, I said it; they were afraid of failure. And the powers that be in the organization at the time were also afraid of failure. (And perhaps with good reason I might add \xe2\x80\x93 neither Sam Perlozzo, Lee Mazzilli, or Dave Trembley have ever managed in the big leagues since their time with the Orioles.) But when I say that a pitcher is afraid of failure, I mean one thing specifically \xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99re nibblers. For years we saw Oriole pitchers try to nibble on the corner of the strike zone to try to fool hitters into swinging. And don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, sometimes you have to do that \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the game. However you can\xe2\x80\x99t make a career out of it, and it can\xe2\x80\x99t be your bread and butter\xe2\x80\xa6for the same reason that throwing only straight strikes can\xe2\x80\x99t be your bread and butter. You have to be nimble as a pitcher to survive at the big league level.Pitchers become nibblers often because they\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of what will happen if they get too close to the middle of the plate. And again, this can often be for good reason. But for years Oriole pitchers didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to know how to employ deceptive measures such as late movement on pitches to fool hitters. Ultimately what would happen would be that hitters would take pitch after pitch, going deeper and deeper into counts. Then when the guy had to throw a strike he either wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to (because umpires would know that he was making a living on being a nibbler and would thus give the hitter the outer part of the plate), or that strike would get tagged \xe2\x80\x93 FAR. Pitch counts would also be driven up little by little, which would tax the bullpen.However now it seems that the O\xe2\x80\x99s have their act much more in order when it comes to pitching, both in the rotation and the bullpen. In Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game Chris Tillman gave up one walk, and Even Meeks gave up two later in the game. Three walks in a game isn\xe2\x80\x99t too shabby. And keep in mind that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen was a big reason why they went to the playoffs in 2012. Based on Monday\xe2\x80\x99s performance, could this year\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen be similar? We can\xe2\x80\x99t say after only one game, but the pitchers that came in certainly looked strong.After what seemed like an endless off day, the Orioles will resume league play tonight at the yard against Boston. They\xe2\x80\x99ll send Ubaldo Jimenez to the mound to make his Orioles debut, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Boston\xe2\x80\x99s John Lackey. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIn an era where starters rarely make it through\xc2\xa0seven innings, the bullpen has become an increasingly valuable component of a winning team. However, because GM\xe2\x80\x99s still seem reluctant to pay top dollar for relievers, teams are usually left to reconstruct their bullpen every offseason. After a stellar season in 2012, the Orioles bullpen took a step back last season. The Orioles lost a few familiar faces this offseason, and brought in several new arms to replace them, but the question is always whether the changes have improved the bullpen or not.The most glaring hole left in the bullpen was created when closer Jim Johnson was dealt to Oakland in January. The deal made sense economically. With arbitration, Johnson would have made over 10 million this season. That\xe2\x80\x99s too much money for a closer, and with his struggles last season most Orioles fans weren\xe2\x80\x99t too upset about his departure. However, Johnson made 145 appearances over the last two seasons and saved 101 games in that span. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of high-intensity innings that need to be filled. Tommy Hunter has been tapped to take his place, but him moving to closer leaves another late-inning void in the back of the bullpen.One of the earlier moves the Orioles made this offseason was signing the former-Marlin Ryan Webb. Webb\xe2\x80\x99s had several successful seasons with Miami and San Diego, but it could take him some time to adjust to the American League. With a power-sinker, the right-hander could help fill the hole left by Hunter as the late-inning righty. The only red flag may be his strikeout numbers. With only 54 K\xe2\x80\x99s in 80 innings last season, Webb didn\xe2\x80\x99t show the swing-and-miss stuff managers like to see coming into late inning situations. Webb gave up two runs in his Orioles debut and looked anything but unhittable; giving up three hits in two-thirds of an innings. The consensus is that Buck will try to ease him in slowly to give him a chance to adjust to the new league before the high-pressure games that will come later in the year.The dark-horse of the bullpen may be Evan Meek. The former Pirate has shown he can be successful at the major-league level with his 2010 all-star appearance; however, arm problems have hindered him over the past few seasons. The Orioles gave him a chance in the spring and he pitched well enough to garner a roster spot, even beating out veterans like Brad Brach and Alfredo Aceves. Like Webb, his first regular-season appearance wasn\xe2\x80\x99t smooth, as he walked two in less than an inning. It may be a stretch to think Meek could regain his All-Star form, but the veteran could strengthen the bullpen by becoming a solid arm for the middle-innings.Whether or not the bullpen will return to the success of 2012 or struggle to find stability like last season, is difficult to predict this early into the season. O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Matusz have emerged as reliable arms the last two seasons and Hunter obviously has the stuff and mentality to be a successful closer. With new additions Webb and Meek, the Orioles could improve their bullpen numbers from last season; however, Duquette didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave all his eggs in that basket. With arms like Brach and Yoon in Norfolk, the Orioles have the depth to find a replacement if anybody falters. However the bullpen roles play out, the stability of the bullpen will be a key to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 postseason chances.

In fact, since its inception in 1969, the winner of the AL East has gone on to play in the World Series 25 times, winning 14* World Championships. Furthermore, the division has produced the AL Wild Card in all but four years since an extra team was added to the playoffs in 1995. If the Orioles are to make the playoffs for only the second time in the past 17 years, they must emerge victorious from the gauntlet that is the American League East.    *Note: The Boston Red Sox won the 2004 World Series as the AL Wild Card.  April .543 opponent winning percentage Using last season\xe2\x80\x99s winning percentage as a benchmark, the month of April is statistically the most difficult month the Orioles will face. A season opening matchup with the World Champion Red Sox is tough enough in itself, but Baltimore must travel to Detroit and then New York shortly after. The Tigers will be looking to unseat the Red Sox from the pennant and return to the World Series for the second time in three seasons. Meanwhile, the new-look Yankees spent a half billion dollars to revamp their roster. The Birds will continue their string of six consecutive opponents from the AL East with visits from the Blue Jays and Rays, winners of the AL Wild Card Game, followed by trips to Boston and Toronto. Although the Blue Jays seem to be the easiest matchup of the schedule\xe2\x80\x99s first month, the Orioles narrowly took the season series in 2013, 10-9. The month concludes with visits from the Royals, who finished with a better record than the Orioles and were in playoff contention until the final week of the season, and the Pirates, hoping to make consecutive playoff appearances for the first time in over 20 years.

Although they face four 2013 playoff teams, only one will have an impact in the division race. The month opens with a trip to Minnesota to face the Twins, who are looking to avoid their fourth-consecutive 90-loss season. Following that three-game set, the Orioles will complete their road trip against the Rays at the Trop. Many pundits have picked the Rays to emerge from the American League, so this series allows the Orioles an opportunity to gauge their expectations. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will come home for a matchup with the 111-loss Astros, also receiving a return visit from the Tigers before they hit the road once more. A trip to Kansas City may have implications on the Wild Card race, while a matchup with the Pirates will provide a rematch of the 1971 World Series. Cleveland, winners of one Wild Card spot last season, will be welcomed to Camden Yards for a short series before the Orioles hit the road to end the month. Finally, a matchup with former Oriole Francisco Rodriguez and the Brewers will precede a calendar-turning trip to Houston.      at Twins 66-96 .407   at Rays 92-71 .564   Astros 51-111 .315   Tigers 93-69 .574   at Royals 86-76 .531   at Pirates 94-68 .580   Indians 92-70 .568   at Brewers 74-88 .457   at Astros 51-111 .315   June .531 opponent winning percentage The Orioles will continue their Texas road trip with a rematch of the 2012 Wild Card Game. The Rangers just missed out on a playoff spot last season, losing to the Rays in a one-game tiebreaker. Camden Yards should be rocking for two big series, as the Orioles will play host to the AL West Champion Athletics and the Red Sox. The homestand will conclude with a visit from the Blue Jays, before the Birds continue another string of consecutive AL East matchups with trips to Tampa and New York.

Another trip to Boston will precede interleague play, as the Orioles and Nationals will play a unique four-game series, with two games played in Baltimore and two in DC. Another matchup with the Yankees hopes to send the Orioles into the break with a divisional lead. With home field advantage in the World Series now set, the push to the playoffs will begin with the Birds on the west coast. Matchups with the Athletics, Angels, and Mariners will all provide challenges, as the O\xe2\x80\x99s have historically struggled during this portion of the schedule.

The Birds will travel outside of the country for a quick series with the Blue Jays before returning home to play host to the National League Champion Cardinals for the first time since 2011. Continuing the homestand, the Orioles will play the Yankees once again before heading on a Midwest road trip. Another matchup Cleveland will be crucial down the stretch, as both teams may be fighting for playoff positioning. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will play two series in Chicago, one on the north side and the other on the south, with both teams coming off of seasons where they lost almost 100 games apiece.

Playing in the most difficult division may give your team bragging rights, but the seven divisional matchups down the stretch may push the Orioles above and beyond or break them. A visit from the Reds, a playoff team in three straight seasons, will open the month, but the seven-consecutive divisional matchups to end the season. The Birds will make their final trips of the season to Tampa and Boston before returning to Baltimore for the final homestand of the year. The Yankees, Blue Jays, and Red Sox will visit Camden Yards, as the Orioles hope to reach two million visitors for the third-consecutive season. The 60th season of Orioles baseball will conclude with the team on the road with games in New York and Toronto.

With six series matchups against divisional opponents, the Orioles could open a sizable lead or dig themselves a hole early on. If you hope to be within reach of a divisional crown, a winning first month of the season allows room for error throughout the season, as opposed to playing catch-up from the onset. Schedule-wise, the first and last months are similar, as Baltimore plays one additional divisional series in September, but faces one additional playoff opponent in April.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('2014 Bowie Baysox season preview - Camden Chat', ' The Bowie Baysox went 71-71 in 2013, with Mike Wright leading the pitching staff, Eduardo Rodriguez seeing a mid-season promotion from the Keys, and Kevin Gausman, Eddie Gamboa, and Henry Urrutia graduating to Norfolk and/or the majors. As is common for the Orioles\' farm teams, the 2014 roster features more interesting pitchers than hitters, but we\'ll take a brief look at both.    Pitchers Eduardo Rodriguez (SP): Rodriguez isn\'t in the same tier as Gausman or Dylan Bundy, but he\'s been  placed as the next-best prospect for the O\'s on most lists this offseason. In 2013, after making fourteen starts with a 2.85 ERA in Frederick, he was promoted to Bowie and pitched for another eight starts, posting a less impressive 4.22 ERA but striking out 59 batters in 59.2 innings. Rodriguez is in his age 21 season now, so the lefty is young for AA. That makes some bumps in the road (like last night) inevitable, but he has an above-average fastball already, potential for above-average offspeed pitches, and a lot of time on his side. Depending on how he progresses, we could see Rodriguez in Baltimore before the season closes. Dylan Bundy (SP): After losing the 2013 season to Tommy John surgery, Bundy is on the disabled list to start the season, but hopes to get back to game action in June, if not earlier.  It\'s a testament to his tremendous ability that despite the injury and Gausman\'s promising MLB debut, he\'s still rated number one on some O\'s prospect lists. If his rehab continues to go well, and if he picks up right where he left off stuff- and command-wise, Bundy could even see time with the O\'s down the stretch. Tim Berry (SP): Berry\'s a lefty who\'s gotten a nice boost in his prospect ranking thanks more to positive scouting reports than improved minor league numbers. He started 27 games in Frederick last year with similar strikeout and walk rates to what he posted in 2012, but was significantly less hittable, throwing 23.1 more innings but allowing just six more hits. Hopefully, that\'s a result of improving stuff and command, rather than just luck. Berry has an average fastball and potentially plus curve, but needs to continue developing his changeup to have more success against right-handed batters.    Zach Davies (SP): Davies comes in below Berry on most prospect lists, but has a similar ceiling, as a number four starter. He likely ranks lower because, listed at six feet tall and 150 pounds, he\'s considered undersized. (Six feet tall is undersized? Baseball is funny.) Davies is just two months older than Rodriguez and thus is also young for AA, but he\'s shown tremendous improvement over his two minor league seasons (\'12, low-A: 7.2 K/9, 3.6 BB/9, 0.9 HR/9; \'13, high-A: 8.0 K/9, 2.3 BB/9, 0.6 HR/9) to justify a promotion each year. Davies features a classic four-pitch mix with only an average fastball, but reportedly induces lots of groundballs and has good command and pitchability. Hitters  Michael Ohlman (C): Ohlman broke out in a big way last year, posting a .313/.410/.524 batting line with Frederick in 2013 after hinting at improvement in 2012. At 6\'5"", the same height as Matt Wieters, Ohlman is quite tall for a catcher, and unsurprisingly, there are some questions about his ability to stick at the position. Most reports buy into his bat, though, so he needs to continue to hit while polishing his defensive skillset at catcher. It\'s a tall order, but this year could be a big one not just for Ohlman, but for the Orioles: another solid year could make the O\'s much more comfortable with letting Wieters walk after the 2015 season. Honorable Mentions Dariel Alvarez (OF): Alvarez was signed out of Cuba in July of last year and played just 22 games, hitting well enough to get promotions from the Gulf Coast League to Frederick and finally Bowie. He hasn\'t ranked high enough on any prospect lists to get a lot of scouting info, but he\'s one of the more interesting Bowie bats nonetheless.    Christian Walker (1B): Walker advanced rapidly in 2013, moving from Delmarva to Frederick to Bowie. The second promotion was probably a bit aggressive, and his power fell off at AA, but he\'s just old enough (23 now) that the O\'s probably felt the need to push him a bit. He looks like a so-called AAAA player, a too-common fate of already-polished college products, but Camden Depot sees a little more potential than most. Buck Britton (2B), Bobby Bundy (SP), and Sharlon Schoop (SS): Each of these three is the older brother of a guy who\'s made it to the Orioles. That\'s pretty cool, but since none rate on prospect lists these days, I imagine the situation is rather bittersweet for them.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Lessons learned from the Orioles opening series - Camden \\u2026', "" Opening Day is a great day for baseball fans, but a difficult one for analysts. We know that one game is nothing in the grand scheme of the season, but we cannot resist overreacting to the smallest sample size available after a dormant offseason perusing the statistics of the previous season. Thankfully, some things are more permanent than others, and there are some lessons to be learned in the first series of the year. The way the manager sets the lineups and deploys the bullpen is one thing, meaning if nothing else, we can see how Buck Showalter will use the players on his team.    Evan Meek When Evan Meek made the roster coming out of spring training, many, including me, believed that he would be the mop-up guy along with Josh Stinson. On Opening Day, however, he came in to pitch the eighth inning in a one-run game, instead of Darren O'Day or Ryan Webb. This could a worrying sign. Meek did not pitch at all in the majors last season, and Buck is looking too much into spring training stats in trusting Meek. In the last game of the series, he was called upon again in a one-run game with a runner on base. I just don't trust a guy who has not faced big league hitters for a full year, and neither should Buck. On the other hand, O'Day appeared in a game that the O's were losing by four runs, and did not appear in either one-run game. Zach Britton Britton is a bright spot in the bullpen. The opening series shows that Britton is not going to be used a LOOGY; instead, he could be a multiple-inning reliever. I envision him to fill the gap between the starter and the set-up man (ideally O'Day) if the starter does not last to the seventh inning. He is replacing Troy Patton in the bullpen while he is suspended, and is essentially taking over his role too. Jonathan Schoop / Steve Lombardozzi Second base was a question mark coming into spring training. Ryan Flaherty was the frontrunner to be the starter at second base. Then, Manny Machado went on the DL. Flaherty became the starting third baseman, and second base remains an open race. Late acquisition Steve Lombardozzi and top position prospect Jonathan Schoop end up with a platoon at 2B. Jemile Weeks is not a clearly superior option than either. The question will come when Machado returns to 3B. Would Flaherty claim the position full time, or just the left-handed side of the platoon? Steamer's projection of Flaherty against left-handed pitching is so bleak (wOBA of 0.259) that I hope Schoop would remain in the major league or even claim the position outright.    David Lough / Delmon Young The other question in the lineup entering the season is the LF/DH position. The signing of Nelson Cruz seemed to ensure that DH is filled up. David Lough had the left-handed side of the platoon locked up, and the spring training was a battle between Delmon Young and Steve Pearce for the other side of the platoon. Now that the opening series is over, we have our answers. The O's are employing an unconventional platoon between LF and DH. Against southpaws, Cruz starts in LF and Young at DH. Against right-handed pitchers, Cruz starts at DH and Lough in LF. Is this the optimal use of the players? First of all, Pearce is likely a better hitter than Young. Steamer projects Pearce to have a wOBA of 0.344 against southpaws while Young is projected for a wOBA of 0.335. Secondly, Pearce is likely a superior defender in LF than Cruz. Cruz has posted a UZR around -5 runs for the last three seasons, while Pearce is about average in his limited time in the field. The better O's lineup would have a straight platoon of Lough and Pearce in LF. Hopefully Young would hit himself out of the lineup soon and restore the optimal lineup for the O's.

Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0NOT\xc2\xa0time to press the panic button if you\xe2\x80\x99re following this team. Keep in mind that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even gone the entire way through the rotation, and the Orioles ran into some great pitching in Lackey and Felix Doubront in games two and three. Is 1-2 ideal? Not in the least, however\xe2\x80\xa6three games out of 162 is nothing.The biggest hole last night was the same thing that befell the Birds the previous night: starting pitching. Let me be clear; Wei-Yin Chen wasn\xe2\x80\x99t horrible, and as Joe Angel and Fred Manfra said on WBAL\xe2\x80\x99s postgame show, he did put his team in a position to win the game. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.2 IP, 12 H, 4 R, 0 BB, 5 K. The good news is that Chen wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far off in terms of his pitches; if anything, he was hitting spots too well if such a concept exists. There was no movement on Chen\xe2\x80\x99s pitches last night, much like we saw with Ubaldo Jimenez the night before. Furthermore Boston\xe2\x80\x99s a stingy team at the plate, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll force you to throw the ball over in order for them to swing.Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsChen had runners at the corners after two base hits (and nobody out) in the second, but he was able to minimize the damage by inducing a double-play from Wil Middlebrooks. The Orioles gave up a run, however those are the kinds of things you have to do to keep your team in the game. David Ortiz added an RBI-single in the third inning and Ross one in the fourth, and suddenly the Orioles were 3-0 in the hole. However the O\xe2\x80\x99s still had some fight in them, as Chris Davis led off the last of the fourth with a double to center field, and he was later plated by Matt Wieter\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double. Wieters would score on Delmon Young\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single, and suddenly the O\xe2\x80\x99s only trailed by one run.\xc2\xa0Jackie Bradley Jr\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single in the sixth inning would put Boston back up by two, and Chris Davis would score with the bases loaded in the last of the inning on a wild pitch. The O\xe2\x80\x99s also threatened in the eighth, but to no avail.Again, the Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t far off in these games. Granted you\xe2\x80\x99d rather\xc2\xa0not be far off back in spring training as opposed to in the regular season against a division rival, however if pitchers can employ just a bit of late movement on the ball (as Chris Tillman was able to do on Monday) they\xe2\x80\x99ll find themselves in much better shape. I do think that it\xe2\x80\x99s noteworthy to mention how Chen minimized the damage early in the game in yielding that first run. There\xe2\x80\x99s a part of me that says\xc2\xa0you still gave up the run which means you have to score two to beat them. However part of why teams such as Boston are so good is because they set themselves up to have big innings. That second inning last night was starting to go in that direction, however Chen closed the door on that by giving up the one run and erasing the other base runners which removed the threat of a big inning (or at least would have forced Boston to start over in order to have one). Granted the O\xe2\x80\x99s ended up losing by the one run, however if Boston has a big inning there they aren\xe2\x80\x99t even in the game late.While the starting pitching has had a few issues and the bats have been asleep to a certain degree, the biggest bright spot for the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the first three games without a doubt has been the bullpen. Evan Meek and Zack Britton combined last night to pitch 3.1 innings, giving up one hit, one walk, and striking out two. Britton has probably been the \xe2\x80\x9cstar\xe2\x80\x9d if such a thing exists in the \xe2\x80\x98pen, and it seems that he\xe2\x80\x99s really found a home out there. Obviously the goal of every pitcher is to be in the starting rotation, however you can\xe2\x80\x99t underestimate the importance of a great shutdown reliever.Immediately following last night\xe2\x80\x99s game the O\xe2\x80\x99s hopped on their charter and flew to Detroit. There were some storms in the Detroit area overnight, and as of last night there appeared to be some question as to whether or not today\xe2\x80\x99s game would be played. However I checked the Detroit forecast prior to writing this article, and tentatively the forecast looks fairly clear for 1 PM today which is the scheduled start time. The Orioles were saying last night that if today\xe2\x80\x99s game ends up being rained out, they\xe2\x80\x99re expecting to play a day/night doubleheader on Saturday.Detroit has a pretty big advantage in that not only did the Orioles finish their game last night and have to fly to Detroit to prepare for an early 1 PM start, but the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 game with Kansas City was rained out yesterday giving them some extra rest. Granted we\xe2\x80\x99re at a point in the season when extra rest might not mean as much, but every little bit helps. Miguel Gonzalez will head to the bump for the Birds, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Anibal Sanchez. One thing to watch: in five games previously at Comerica Park, Chris Davis has five homers, eight hits, and ten RBI. Both he and the O\xe2\x80\x99s will hope that trend continues this afternoon and all weekend.

A nice team effort in the opening game made for an awesome inaugural win to kick off the new season. But less than excellent starting pitching, along with an anemic offense doomed the Birds to two losses. The Orioles only managed seven runs on 21 hits over their first 26 innings. That is not going to work.It is early and not time for panic, but the Red Sox looked the better team in this series.A positive note is to see Matt Wieters hitting, getting five hits in his first 11 at bats on the season. And Zach Britton looked really great again this evening. Actually, his innings were all I saw of the game (on a restaurant TV), as a car accident locally took down a pole and knocked out all the power in my neighborhood.

Since most of Sanchez\xe2\x80\x99 career has been with the Florida Marlins, there is not much history. He did beat the Orioles and Jeremy Guthrie on June 22, 2010 by a score of 7-4, giving up a three-run homer to Matt Wieters. Adam Jones is 2-for-3 off Sanchez, and Nelson Cruz also has a homer in four at bats. And if the Orioles need a pinch hitter, they can turn to Ubaldo Jimenez, who has a hit and a RBI in three plate appearances off Sanchez!The Tigers will be facing Miguel Gonzalez in his first game of the 2014 season. Detroit has only seen Gonzo twice in his short career. The first game was in 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 it was Miguel\xe2\x80\x99s second start that season on July 15th and was a 4-0 loss (the first loss of his career) against Justin Verlander. The other game was just last year on May 31 when Gonzalez gave up five runs in six innings. This was the famous game where the Orioles were only able to get three runs off Max Scherzer in eight innings, but ultimately win it 7-5 against Jose Valverde in the 9th on a two-out, three-run walk-off homer by Chris Dickerson. Three current Tigers have one home run each against Gonzalez: Ian Kinsler, Austin Jackson, and Miguel Cabrera.EXTRA INNINGS INFO \xe2\x80\x93 The weather forecast is not looking so great for Detroit for the 1:00 game, so if there is a doubleheader on Saturday, the Orioles would be allowed to add an extra player. Anticipating that possibility, Kevin Gausman was held out from making his first AAA start tonight (Thursday), demonstrating good thinking and prep by the Orioles.

The need is for the pitching to hold them in the contest until the bats can tally the necessary runs.

Detroit never looked back after that, although the O\xe2\x80\x99s did put across a two runs in the ninth inning.You don\xe2\x80\x99t lose by eight runs and point at one thing, however the rain got to be too much in theCourtesy of Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sportslast of the fourth inning and the umpires called for the tarp. The teams sat through 30 plus minutes of a rain delay, and Buck Showalter sent Gonzalez right back out after the rain delay. Granted the delay wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long, however as much as Gonzalez was struggling prior to the \xe2\x80\x9cpause\xe2\x80\x9d I would have considered lifting him. Managers will often do that, albeit normally after lengthier delays than what the Orioles had. How the game would have played out, we\xe2\x80\x99ll never know; but we do know that Rajai Davis hit a three-run homer, and Tori Hunter a solo shot following the delay. Hunter would also add an RBI-single in the last of the third, and Victor Martinez netted his 2,000th hit as a major leaguer in the form of a two-run homer in the eighth.If there\xe2\x80\x99s a silver lining for the Orioles, it was the ninth inning. \xc2\xa0Following a Nelson Cruz single, backup catcher Steve Clevenger (who started for Matt Wieters in a day game after a night game) drove in the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 first run since the first inning with an RBI-triple. He would later score on Jonathan Schoop\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single, however the O\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an eight-run comeback in them as they fell 10-4.Offensively my personal opinion is that other teams are in fact afraid of Oriole bats in a sense. Their only shot around the likes of Davis, Jones, etc. is to get them to chase. Unfortunately, the Orioles are obliging them. Jones is starting to sit on pitches, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a positive sign. However the entire lineup needs to find a way to get on track. 1-3 is nothing in baseball, however you have to be careful that 1-3 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t turn into 2-16 as it did in 2010. (And the fact is that this team has much higher expectations than that one.) As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said previously, it begins and ends however with starting pitching. Thus far that has been suspect. However all it takes is one good game and/or one good start to get things rolling the other way.This game was noteworthy in the sense that it was the first one that featured a challenged play involving the Orioles. Albeit Detroit was the team that made the challenge, however in the fifth inning Steve Lombardozzi slid hard into second base to break up a possible double-play, and the shortstop bobbled the ball \xe2\x80\x93 after having touched the bag. Lombardozzi was ruled safe, which was challenged and upheld. I would tend to think that he should have been called out, however needless to say in the first replay challenge involving the Orioles, the Birds emerged victorious.Bud Norris will get his first start of 2014 this afternoon, and will do so in hopes that he can be the team\xe2\x80\x99s stopper. Norris will be opposed by Rick Porcello, who Detroit had penciled in as going to the Orioles prior to last season when they had their eyes on J.J. Hardy. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see who got the better of that non-trade later this afternoon. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Should one not be ""too good?""', 'Although I\xe2\x80\x99m not a fan of the sport any longer, I played soccer when I was a kid (among other sports of course). I was never gifted as an athlete, which is probably why I grasp at straws to stay somehow connected to athletics today by doing things such as penning this column! However with that said, I got caught up in what my Dad called the \xe2\x80\x9cold football mentality\xe2\x80\x9d in that the \xe2\x80\x9cbad players\xe2\x80\x9d got stuck on defense. Yeah, I said it \xe2\x80\x93 the bad players. I know that nowadays we\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to use terms like that when referring to kids or youth sports, but in my 1980\xe2\x80\x99s mentality we called a spade a spade.So I ended up playing a lot of fullback as a young kid during soccer season, when in reality I really wanted to play forward so that I could score. (And for the record, I did end up playing forward later on.) However at one point I ended up playing goalie, which in my mind was actually a step lower than fullback. (Now of course I recognize how important both of those positions are.) But I found that I was a good goalie; I would generally stop whatever was shot at me. My Dad was often the coach, and when he\xe2\x80\x99d make the lineup the night before the game my heart would sink when I\xe2\x80\x99d see my name in goal. Since playing defense was in essence a punishment in my eyes I thought that if I played poorly I\xe2\x80\x99d truly never get the chance to play forward, but then again if I did really well they\xe2\x80\x99d never move me out of the goal. Quite a dilema at times.So what\xe2\x80\x99s the point here in relation to the Baltimore Orioles? I look at guys like Brian Matusz and Zach Britton, and I see some similar characteristics. Granted they\xe2\x80\x99re both gifted athletes who train year-around, whereas I would balk at running laps around the field (see what I did there\xe2\x80\xa6balk?!). However both of them set out to be starting pitchers. In fact as I said on the Birds Watcher Radio Show yesterday, when he first came up I thought Matusz would be the next great power southpaw. However they\xe2\x80\x99ve both found homes in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve found that they\xe2\x80\x99re both very effective in those roles.Both players have expressed interest in starting at some point, however they also know thatCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sportsthere\xe2\x80\x99s probably not a place for them right now in the rotation. However again, they do find themselves in a bit of a catch-22. The better they pitch in relief, the more Buck Showalter will call them out of the pen \xe2\x80\x93 and thus the longer they could be in the bullpen. It\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for relievers not to be effective as starters \xe2\x80\x93 see Josh Stinson and T.J. McFarland\xe2\x80\x99s spot starts last season. And the same can often be true in reverse; many times starting pitchers struggle when they\xe2\x80\x99re asked to take the ball in relief at various points.One way or the other, Matusz and Britton find themselves in situations whereby they\xe2\x80\x99ll get sent packing if they cease to get the job done properly. However the better they look, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible that the starting rotation gets further and further out of their grasp. The big difference between my example from the soccer team and their situation is that in their case we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about two professional athletes as opposed to a weak-willed twelve-year old boy who hated running. (Note to that twelve-year old: you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a center forward in about two years\xe2\x80\xa6so cool your britches!)\xc2\xa0But it does illustrate a dilema that can be very real for some pitchers.The late Mike Flanagan became a reliever late in his career, but Britton and Matusz are much younger than he was at that time. Aside from perhaps your top-of-the-line closers such as Dennis Eckersley or Mariano Rivera, there\xe2\x80\x99s probably not a reliever in baseball that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a starter or who didn\xe2\x80\x99t set out to be a starter. But those are just the turns that the game sometimes gives players. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times, baseball often mirrors life; and life\xe2\x80\x99s not always perfect or easy. Luckily for the Orioles and their fans, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing about Britton or Matusz that indicates they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be good at their roles as relievers. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in the rotation, however it would be disappointing if the disappointment wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there.

They looked as if they had played a game on the east coast the previous evening and had to fly in for an afternoon start time. You would have thought that they had travel problems that delayed them an extra three hours, and that they probably did not get to bed until 5:00 in the morning, and had to get up at 7:00 \xe2\x80\xa6 or something like that.The first and last innings went well for the Birds, with Chris Davis driving in two runs to lead off the scoring. But the Orioles would not get back to home plate again until two more scored in the 9th inning \xe2\x80\x93 featuring a triple by Steve Clevenger.As if the scheduling weirdness and the travel trials were not enough, the weather tossed insult upon injury with two rain delays. Miguel Gonzalez simply did not have anything much working for him and could not command his pitches, and so he was pretty much lit up by an admittedly tough Detroit lineup. Miguel Cabrera had four hits, and with that he has reached the 2,000-hits plateau \xe2\x80\x93 only the 9th player in MLB history to do that before age 31. He is amazing.This is not the start the Orioles wanted for 2014, to be 1-3 with Verlander just over the horizon on Sunday.

However, there are many things to straighten out, so why not begin today?Pitching for the Orioles will be Bud Norris making his first start of the 2014 season.

04/07/2014,"[('Series Preview: Baltimore Orioles @ New York Yankees, 7-9 ...', ' 2-4 isn\'t a great way to start the season, but thank goodness for that win yesterday, because it\'s a lot better than 1-5. The Yankees started their season 3-3, but got to open against the Astros and Blue Jays.    Monday, 7 April: Ubaldo Jimenez @ Hiroki Kuroda     Jimenez Kuroda   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 182.2 6.0 201.1 6.0   ERA 3.30 6.00 3.31 3.00   FIP 3.43 7.52 3.56 4.18   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .239/.317/.367 .227/.346/.500 .249/.291/.392 .143/.182/.476     Jimenez didn\'t impress in his first start as an Oriole, giving up a pair of two-run home runs. Otherwise, though, his line for that game doesn\'t look too bad: 6 IP, 5 H, 3 BB, 6 SO. Unfortunately, pitching in the AL East means that you\'re going to spend a lot of time in homer-friendly ballparks, and Yankee Stadium is one of them. In a press release announcing the signing, the Orioles tried to sell Jimenez as a groundball pitcher, but he hasn\'t been since his time with the Rockies. Here\'s hoping that his last outing wasn\'t a sign of things to come. Kuroda started off his season well enough, allowing two runs and three hits over six innings against the Astros, with five strikeouts to one walk. He\'s arguably been the Yankees\' best starter for the last couple of years, though some struggles in the second half of last season made some scouts question whether he was finally just getting too old to be effective. Kuroda throws a sinker most often, at 43% of the time to batters regardless of handedness. He has a slider he\'ll throw most often to righties (38%), but he\'ll mix it in against lefties early in the count, too. He also features a splitter, which he uses against lefties nearly 50% of the time when ahead in the count or with two strikes, and he\'ll use it to try to strike out righties as well. Finally, he\'ll occasionally toss a first-pitch get-me-over curve or an 0-1 four-seamer against lefties.    Maybe hot: Nick Markakis (.947 OPS, 19 PA), Carlos Beltran (1.417 OPS, 12 PA)    Likely not: Nelson Cruz (.205 OPS, 15 PA), Ichiro Suzuki (.500 OPS, 12 PA) Tuesday, 8 April: Wei-Yin Chen @ Ivan Nova     Chen Nova   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 137.0 5.2 139.1 5.2   ERA 4.07 6.35 3.10 3.18   FIP 4.04 1.42 3.47 6.54   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .272/.321/.440 .444/.444/.481 .258/.330/.348 .316/.500/.368        Chen got knocked around for twelve hits in 5.2 innings in his 2014 debut. I missed the game, but from Mark\'s writeup, it sounds like Chen was just very unlucky, and his defense didn\'t help him out any, either. Chen didn\'t walk any and struck out five, which just reinforces the notion that the baseball gods were against him that night, and it gives us reason for optimism going forward. Nova walked five batters in his first start of the season, while only striking out one. Somehow, despite allowing six hits as well, he only allowed two runs over his 5.2 innings of work. Nova struggled against the O\'s in 2012, but threw two complete games against them last year, in what was a bit of a breakout season for him. He throws fastballs about 60% of the time, roughly 2:1 sinkers to four-seamers against lefties, but the reverse ratio against righties. Most of the rest of his pitches are curveballs, used about 35% of the time regardless of batter handedness. Nova also has a changeup and slider/cutter, but he almost never uses them.

Enough scouts and analysts have been saying that Gonzalez is basically the new Jeremy Guthrie, outpitching his peripherals until he doesn\'t, and every time he has a bad start or two, it\'s hard not to worry that ""doesn\'t"" has finally arrived. That said, one start is one start, and pitchers with Gonzalez\'s lack of overwhelming stuff are just going to have bad ones on occasion. Despite allowing a leadoff homer, Tanaka was impressive in his MLB debut, striking out eight Blue Jays and walking none over seven innings. Tanaka\'s main weapons are reportedly four- and two-seam fastballs, the ratio of which he varies by batter handedness, much like Nova; a splitter, which he throws often as a strikeout pitch to both righties and lefties; a slider, which he uses often to strike out righties; and a curve, which is mostly a first-pitch show-me option.

Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsThe first week of the 2014 season is in the books, everybody. Please take this opportunity to take a big, deep breath and exhale. Now that we are all calm, let\xe2\x80\x99s review this past week and then preview the upcoming week\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.The Orioles are 2-4, winning their home opener against the Boston Red Sox, followed by a four-game losing streak with two losses to both the Red Sox and the Detroit Tigers, and finally a win against Detroit ace, Justin Verlander.The storylines so far have been the underperforming pitching staff and a sputtering offense. During the losing streak, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starting rotation really struggled. Ubaldo Jimenez (6 IP, 4 ER), Wei-Yin Chen (5.2 IP, 4 ER), Miguel Gonzalez (3.1 IP, 7 ER), and Bud Norris (5 IP, 5 ER) all started the season 0-1.While some fans have merely brushed those struggles off, citing that it is only the first week of the season, other fans have not been as easy going. I see both sides of this. I understand that it is early and things can turn around quickly, but I also believed that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters would be their weakness prior to start of the season, and those starts only reinforced that thinking. Cold, wet weather may have played a role in Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s start, and it is reasonable to think that the rain delay in Detroit may have opened the floodgates in that particular game, but the other starters really don\xe2\x80\x99t have much of an excuse aside from pitching against two of the best offensive teams in baseball.One\xc2\xa0bright spot for the Orioles was Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa0(1-0) performances against both Boston on opening day and Detroit on Sunday. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s first start was good, not great. In 5 IP, he gave up just 1 ER. Many would have liked to see him pitch efficient enough to go deeper, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint in his second start in Detroit. Against the Tigers, Tillman pitched 8.1 IP and gave up just 1 ER for his first win of the season. He clearly is Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s ace and it is nice to know that there is finally someone to stop the bleeding going forward.Aside from the starters, we saw Tommy Hunter successfully save both opportunities. We now know that he is the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 closer, despite the lack of any official announcement by manager Buck Showalter. In three appearances (two save opportunities), Hunter has \xc2\xa0pitched 1.1 IP with no earned runs and one hit allowed. A very small sample size, but we know now who the closer is.As for hitting, there really should be no concern over the lineup. The Orioles hitters have scored just 20 runs in their first six games while batting a very disappointing .229. Catcher Matt Wieters led the team with 7 hits including a double and a home run, however there are were no real notable standouts offensively. The core of the Orioles lineup will hit, without a doubt, but injuries have made for an interesting bottom half of the lineup in the first week.Where Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s absence was easy to foresee, J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0limited in playing time due to back spasms forced\xc2\xa0Jonathan Schoop, Ryan Flaherty and Steve Lombardozzi into the lineup all at once. How long the injury will persist is unknown, but it is clear that the lack of legitimate infield depth put the Orioles in a tough spot offensively in the first week.The Orioles will look to find their groove this week against the Yankees in New York and the Toronto Blue Jays at Camden Yards. In the Yankees series, it will be Jimenez (0-1, 6.00) v. Hiroki Kuroda (0-1, 3.00), Chen (0-1, 6.35) v. Nova (1-0, 3.18) and Gonzalez (0-1, 18.90) v. Tanaka (1-0, 2.57). Kuroda has had success against the Orioles, going 2-3 with just a 3.20 ERA in six games, while holding Orioles hitters to a .238 AVG, and will face Jimenez who has a 6.45 ERA in four starts against the Yankees for the first matchup between the two teams in the 2014 regular season.\xc2\xa0One storyline to look forward to in the Yankees series is if the Orioles trail by three or less runs in the ninth inning. Orioles fans will no longer have to limit games against the Yankees to eight innings, now that legendary closer Mariano Rivera has retired. Though Nate Robertson is a formidable pitcher, he is no Rivera and that has to count for something.The Orioles went 9-10 against the Yankees and 10-9 against the Blue Jays last season and will look to get back on track against two of their divisional foes. Their pitching will again have to face off against strong hitting teams, but it will be important to see some improvements as divisional matchups are always important, no matter the month, ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles Head to NY for First 2014 Series', '\xc2\xa0Apr 2, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez (31) throws in the first inning against the Boston Red Sox at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAfter a great final game of the series win in Detroit (summary here) in what may be remembered as a critical early game of the season, the Baltimore Orioles head to New York for their first series against the Yankees. The 1:05 game will be the home opener for the Yankees \xe2\x80\x93 sure to be a bit strange for Pinstripes people as the final home opener for Derek Jeter, along with it being odd for Orioles fans to see that Brian Roberts fellow on the dark side of the field.It will be interesting to see what new Orioles starter Ubaldo Jimenez can really do against the evil empire. Will he handle them fine as a key component of the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 rotation? Or will he revert to his historic performance record of a 6.45 ERA over four games? That sample size is small indeed, and though Ulbaldo was overcome by a couple of homers in his first outing, one could also see some great ball movement and the makings of a dominant pitcher.The two members of the Yankees that Jimenez has most often faced are Kelly Johnson and Brian McCann from their days together in the National League. McCann is 8-for-25, though with only one homer as his single extra-base hit. Johnson is 8-for-43, though has an addition nine walks. Carlos Beltran is 4-for-11 with two homers. On the other hand, Mark Teixeira is but 1-for-18 and Ichero Suzuki 3-for-12.PAABH2B3BHRRBIBBSOBAKelly Johnson43338400194.242Brian McCann28258001334.320Mark Teixeira18161000127.063Carlos Beltran12114102310.364Alfonso Soriano992000102.222Ichero Suzuki1293000202.250Jacoby Ellsbury752000120.400Brett Gardner771000101.143Derek Jeter330000101.000Brian Roberts330000001.000\xc2\xa0The Yankees will look to Hiroki Kuroda to open their home season. Last year in four games, Kuroda was 1-2 against the Orioles, with a no-decision won by the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Two of these starts were terrific, whereas two were very poor. On April 7, Kuroda pitched what I recall as the most dominant game against the Orioles in 2013, giving up five hits in a complete game shutout. And again on July 7th he pitched seven shutout innings in a game he departed with a 1-0 lead, though the Orioles would later score two in the 9th inning to win. But in the other two starts against the Birds, he gave up nine runs in eight innings.In the 39-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s first start this season against Houston, he yielded two runs on three hits in six innings.Among Orioles hitters, Nick Markakis has the best numbers against Kuroda, being 7-for-19 with a homer. Matt Wieters is 6-for-19, and though Chris Davis is only 5-for-24, he has two homers and a double. Nelson Cruz is a mere 1-for 15 and J.J. Hardy is but 3-for-24 \xe2\x80\x93 maybe his back will need another day of rest.PAABH2B3BHRRBIBBSOBAChris Davis24205102517.250J.J.

Jeter reached into the vertical case, pulled out the bat like sword from a stone, tapped the Joe DiMaggio sign above the stairs with his fingers and went to work.The bat did not help him when he struck out in the first inning, or in the sixth, when he whiffed again. In between were a double-play grounder that brought in a run and a double off the left-field wall.The double received all the attention, because Jeter did not run hard from the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box and had to slide, headfirst, to narrowly beat the throw.

Young and Wieters each drove in three runs, and Jones delivered one of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 four doubles at a half-empty Yankee Stadium. Everyone in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s starting lineup got a hit and scored a run. The Orioles posted their second-highest hit total in the Bronx, eclipsed only by a 22-hit outburst in 1986. By the late innings, the game took on a spring training feel. The Yankees pulled several starters and the often-demanding crowd didn\xe2\x80\x99t even bother to boo while the Birds ran around the bases. There was a big cheer, however, when two fans sprinted onto the grass and were tackled in the outfield by a wave of security personnel. Wei-Yin Chen (1-1) weathered five innings for the win, giving up four runs and nine hits. Ivan Nova (1-1) was tagged for seven runs and 10 hits in 3 2-3 innings. For all the big hits, it was a little grounder that helped things get out of hand at the start. After Nick Markakis led off the game with a single, Young followed with a bouncer up the middle. Many shortstops in the majors could\xe2\x80\x99ve turned it into a double play, but 39-year-old Derek Jeter couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite get to it and the ball skipped under his glove for a single. Chris Davis followed with a sacrifice fly, and Jones hit his first homer of the season for a 3-0 lead. The Orioles chased Nova with a three-run fourth that made it 7-1 and added four more in the sixth. Alfonso Soriano and Kelly Johnson hit solo home runs for the Yankees. Rookie Yangervis Solarte struck again, too, with a pair of doubles \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s hit safely in his first six career starts and is 11 for 24 overall with six doubles. Young was 1 for 6 this season before manager Buck Showalter gave him this start. The designated hitter had an RBI single in the fourth that finished Nova and added his first homer, a two-run drive in the sixth. Wieters connected in the eighth. Ryan Flaherty also had three hits for the Orioles after starting the year in a 1-for-21 rut. One of his hits was an early bunt single when Francisco Cervelli, a catcher making his first pro appearance at first base, ranged too far wide and in to field the ball. NOTES: Carlos Beltran\xe2\x80\x99s RBI double marked the first run permitted by Baltimore in the first inning this season. \xe2\x80\xa6 Nova had allowed four or fewer earned runs in 24 straight starts since September 2012. That was tied with Hiroki Kuroda for the longest such string by a Yankees pitcher since Ron Guidry\xe2\x80\x99s 27-game streak ended in 1982. \xe2\x80\xa6 With David Robertson on the disabled list, Yankees manager Joe Girardi said RHP Shawn Kelley will likely be the closer. \xe2\x80\xa6 Orioles SS J.J. Hardy was out of the starting lineup for the third game in a row because of back spasms. \xe2\x80\xa6 Soriano hit his 407th career home run. \xe2\x80\xa6 RHP Masahiro Tanaka (1-0) starts the series finale Wednesday night in his Yankee Stadium debut vs. RHP Miguel Gonzalez (0-1).

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsApart from Chris Tillman, the Baltimore Orioles starting pitching woes continued on Monday with a first game of the series loss to the Yankees 4-2. Failing to get through five innings was Ubaldo Jimenez, who once again had some good stuff with movement, but the issuance of five walks was his downfall.While watching Jimenez, I love the great ball movement. But today I found myself thinking about how four years of watching these deep counts and free passes is going to drive me crazy, and I honestly think I get to crazy land slower than most O\xe2\x80\x99s fans. But I do think he will figure this out sufficiently. He has to! There are 50 million reasons why he must!And again, though the starting pitching dominates the talk of Orioles fans and has been, so far, the fulfillment of their greatest fears, the run production has been as large a problem. Really, four runs given up should not guarantee a loss \xe2\x80\x93 not to a team with the powerful lineup the Orioles run out on the field. But unfortunately, too many are not playing near their potential or historic averages. You never get a full line-up hitting perfectly on all cylinders, but right now the Orioles have most of their players underachieving at the same time. This will change \xe2\x80\xa6 we just don\xe2\x80\x99t want the hole to get too deep before it does.So, in trying to find even a single good pitching performance other than those by Tillman, the Orioles look again to Wei-Yin Chen \xe2\x80\x93 coming off a first game, 12-hit attack by the Red Sox last week. And the rest of this paragraph is not going to encourage you either. You were warned! Chen is 1-3 lifetime against the Yankees with a 5.34 ERA in seven starts and 40.1 innings pitched. He has seen nine Yankees take him deep.Against the current Yankees lineup, his record is not terribly poor. Many of those who hurt him most are now gone. Gardner is 5-for-9 and Soriano 3-for-4. Jeter has been reasonably contained. Of course he has not faced Brian Roberts, Brian McCann, or Carlos Beltran.PAABH2B3BHRRBIBBSOBADerek Jeter19185001303.278Jacoby Ellsbury10103000001.300Brett Gardner1095201412.556Ichero Suzuki910000001.111Alfonso Soriano543100110.750Francisco Cervelli221000000.500Kelly Johnson200000000.000\xc2\xa0The Orioles will be facing Ivan Nova, who gave up two runs on six hits and five walks over 5.2 innings in his first start this year \xe2\x80\x93 a 4-2 victory over Houston. He pitched four times against the Orioles last year with a 2.43 ERA over 29.2 innings, getting two wins including a three-hit shutout on August 31st.Quite a number of the Orioles have good numbers against Nova, especially Matt Wieters who is 11-for-29 with four homers and Chris Davis with 8-for-23 with three homers. This might also be a good game to give Delmon Young a shot, as he has been 7-for-13 with two homers. Adam Jones, Nick Markakis, and J.J. Hardy are 1-2-3 of all MLB players in most times to the plate against Nova in his career (since 2010) \xe2\x80\xa6PAABH2B3BHRRBIBBSOBAAdam Jones39357200308.200Nick Markakis393411301244.324J.J.

But even now, the four players who take the infield these days for the Yankees are hardly recognizable.On Tuesday, the backup catcher Francisco Cervelli made his first career appearance as a professional at first base, in place of the injured Mark Teixeira. Brian Roberts, 36, who replaced the departed Robinson Cano, was at second. The rookie Yangervis Solarte, replacing the suspended Alex Rodriguez, played third. Even Jeter hardly looks like himself these days.This group is prone to defensive lapses because of the players\xe2\x80\x99 ages or their inexperience at certain positions.Yankees starter Ivan Nova was not effective (seven earned runs in three and two-thirds innings) in a 14-5 loss to the Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium, but he did not have much help from his infield defense, either. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      In the first inning, after Nick Markakis had led off the game with a single to center field, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 designated hitter, Delmon Young, hit a ground ball toward the shortstop side of second base. After a slow couple of steps, Jeter lunged but could not snag the grounder, which went into center for a single. A shortstop with better range than Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 he is rated near the bottom in most defensive metrics \xe2\x80\x94 could have turned that grounder into a double play, or at least a forceout.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  After a sacrifice fly drove in Markakis, Adam Jones hit a two-run homer.\xe2\x80\x9cHe dove,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Joe Girardi said of Jeter, who was not in the clubhouse after the game. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, he did everything he could to make the play. It seemed to get through the infield fairly quickly. But he did everything he could.\xe2\x80\x9dA diplomatic Nova said that it was impossible to assume what would happen once a ball was put into play.\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you want to get the double play, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out that way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.With the Yankees trailing by 3-1 in the second, Orioles second baseman Ryan Flaherty hit a bunt toward first base that slipped past Nova and was fielded by Cervelli, who could not make a play in time. The next batter, Jonathan Schoop, lined a ball that Solarte was unable to catch, and it went down the line for a run-scoring double.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  None of the plays was ruled an error, and none was routine, but they were all plays that could have been made.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees rely heavily on positioning to compensate for their infield, which is by turns slow-moving and inexperienced. They have their infielders shift sharply toward a particular side if their advance reports say a player hits the ball to that area. For example, the Yankees had Solarte move to the right side when the left-handed Baltimore slugger Chris Davis \xe2\x80\x94 who hit 53 home runs last season \xe2\x80\x94 was up to bat. But they will use a shift for any player, not just power hitters. On Monday, the Yankees employed a similar right-side shift for the light-hitting Flaherty, who had a .683 on-base plus slugging percentage last year.

But the one thing they cannot do for Jeter is turn back the clock to make him quicker on balls hit away from him. Shifts can do only so much.

We look at histories and our pitchers and what type of pitches they have. We try to put them in the best play possible. Sometimes, they don\xe2\x80\x99t always go there, but we\xe2\x80\x99re playing the law of averages. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to see it work a lot more than not work. But every once in a while, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to go the way we want.\xe2\x80\x9dNova was as much to blame for the poor day as the infield was. The seven earned runs were the most he had allowed since Aug. 6, 2012.Even after Nova\xe2\x80\x99s poor start, the Yankees trailed by just three runs through five innings. But Young\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer off reliever Vidal Nuno began the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 four-run sixth, putting the game out of reach.

Yankees catcher Brian McCann said Nova simply could not get into a groove throwing his fastball down in the zone, making his curveball less effective.

Cervelli said he had not wanted to risk a throw to first because nobody was in position to catch the ball.\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my fault,\xe2\x80\x9d Nova said. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have made that play. I should have run to the base or run straight at the ball.\xe2\x80\x9dIn the end, Nova\xe2\x80\x99s infield play was no better than his teammates\xe2\x80\x99.

One of his fondest memories is of his father taking him to his first game at Yankee Stadium in 1954. The Indians were playing the Yankees. He was amazed at how the field glowed.\xe2\x80\x9cIt rained,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cso the grass was even greener.\xe2\x80\x9dPalmer eventually made his own memories in major league parks around the country. His r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 includes 268 victories, a .638 winning percentage, eight 20-win seasons and a 2.86 earned run average in 19 seasons. He is the only pitcher to win World Series games in three decades, in 1966, 1970, 1971 and 1983. He won three Cy Young Awards and four Gold Gloves. He threw a no-hitter against Oakland in 1969 and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990.Palmer, 68, now a television commentator for Orioles games, expects the team to contend for the playoffs.His charity work includes support for Autism Speaks, the autism advocacy organization, and for B.A.T., or the Baseball Assistance Team, which helps former players and baseball employees who have fallen on hard times. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Q. How do you spend your time away from baseball?A. In the winter, my wife, Susan, has a shop in Palm Beach \xe2\x80\x94 Island Home. I help her there. My stepson, Spencer, is autistic. He\xe2\x80\x99s 17 and I take him to school and we go to the gym and I do a lot of things with him. I do a lot of fund-raising in Palm Beach and support Autism Speaks.Q. Is there a pitcher who reminds you of you?A. Michael Wacha of the Cardinals has a similar windup. He comes over the top and throws hard. He has the big curveball. We both got to the big leagues very early.Q. What do you think of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 additions of Nelson Cruz and Ubaldo Jimenez?A. I was at the Orioles Fanfest and said to Dan Duquette, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, the most well-rested G.M. in baseball.\xe2\x80\x9d I have that kind of relationship with him. He started laughing. He said hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99re not done. Then they go out and get Jimenez and Cruz. Jimenez had a great last 16 games last year. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s power will help replace Nate McLouth offensively, although he won\xe2\x80\x99t be as good defensively or give you the same speed.I love their core players: Matt Wieters, Adam Jones, Chris Davis, J. J. Hardy, Nick Markakis, who was not healthy last year, Manny Machado. Brooks Robinson told me, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if Machado\xe2\x80\x99s not better than I was. That\xe2\x80\x99s quite a statement. I see them as contenders.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Q. How do you think Masahiro Tanaka will do for the Yankees?A. Culture, strike zone, facing the best hitters on the planet. Yankee Stadium is not easy to pitch in. There\xe2\x80\x99s always an adjustment period. The Yankees would be very pleased if he pitched as well as Yu Darvish has.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Q. What do you think about Derek Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s retiring?A. Baseball is going to miss him. He\xe2\x80\x99s one of the transcendent players. I\xe2\x80\x99ve played with Eddie Murray, Frank Robinson, Brooks Robinson and Cal Ripken Jr. They\xe2\x80\x99re graceful, have a tremendous work ethic. Reliable. I once asked Derek, your lifetime average is what, .312? You almost hit the same with runners in scoring position. He looked at me and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what changes?\xe2\x80\x9d The mind-set of Derek Jeter was that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what stage he played on. He was able to be the same player and do it for 20 years.

The love/hate relationship that I supposedly had with Earl Weaver. I wish I had been a little more mature in my relationship with Earl. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it would have changed anything. That and the fact that you learn not to judge people by your standards. When I got to the Hall of Fame I gave him a lot of credit. Any time a manager puts your name in the starting lineup as the pitcher that means he trusts you. And Earl did it over a 10-, 11-, 12-year period.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Q. What hitter who was not a star player gave you the most trouble?A. Doug Griffin. I pitched away and he loved the ball out over the plate. He was an outside-half hitter. That all changed when Nolan Ryan hit him in the helmet. He stopped diving.Q. What do you think of the expanded use of replay review?A. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to fine-tune it to make sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t make the game longer. But it\xe2\x80\x99s in the spirit of trying to get the calls right. It\xe2\x80\x99s embraced by baseball, and the umpires want to get calls right. Being an umpire is probably the most difficult thing in baseball. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to hit 97-mile-an-hour pitches, curves and sliders. But every time you make a call, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make somebody unhappy.Q. Should players who used performance-enhancing drugs be allowed in the Hall of Fame?A. Cal Ripken Sr. once told me when I was 18 years old \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99re all in Class A, making $414 after taxes, living in basements, trying to get to Double A \xe2\x80\x94 there are no such things as shortcuts. In a perfect world, they don\xe2\x80\x99t get in even though there are some deserving guys who were Hall of Fame players. They just decided to take shortcuts. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a baseball writer, but I would be more inclined to vote for the guys who used them and still were Hall of Fame caliber players.The most difficult thing is how are you going to hurt the Barry Bondses of the world, the Roger Clemenses, who did not need to do anything? The writers at some point might say Bonds was going to get to the Hall of Fame, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to hit 73 home runs.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  And if they let anybody who used performance-enhancing drugs in, then Pete Rose ought to get in the same year.Q. Would Major League Baseball welcome an openly gay player?A. I see no reason why not. The great thing about baseball is you can really be a zebra, but it\xe2\x80\x99s about if you can play or not. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about race or sexuality.Q. What\xe2\x80\x99s on your iPod?A. My wife is a George Strait fan, and I listen to him. I listen to Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. They bet on the Orioles in 1966, 40 to 1, to win four straight. A thousand dollars. And the next year I got invited to see Frank at the Fontainebleau in Miami Beach in spring training. But, unfortunately, they play a lot of Sinatra at Yankee Stadium when they beat the Orioles.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  This interview was condensed and edited.

Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY SportsBeing a migratory species of fowl, the Baltimore Oriole can\xe2\x80\x99t really be expected to be seen much in cold weather. And sure enough, when a decently warm day for baseball finally arrived, so did the real Baltimore Orioles who laid a 14-5, 20-hit spanking upon the Yankees. This is the baseball team we expected to see!Orioles fans everywhere are hoping that this is the big breakout game that launches the offensive attack for the 2014 season. Everyone in the Orioles starting lineup got into the act. We could continue to pick on Ryan Flaherty by noting that he was the only starter to not register a RBI, although he was one of three Orioles to get three hits in the game. And the Birds broke out with three homers as well: by Adam Jones, Delmon Young, and Matt Wieters.As further proof that Buck Showalter reads my columns and takes advice for the next day, he noted my wise suggestion from yesterday that Young should be put in the lineup \xe2\x80\x93 having stellar numbers historically against Yankees starter Ivan Nova. Young batted second in the lineup and had three hits and three RBIs.Young may get some more playing time, as David Lough is being reported to be headed to the DL for (at this point) undisclosed reasons, with Jemile Weeks being recalled. Weeks was 6-for-12 in his first four games at AAA Norfolk with two triples.Pretty much everything went right for the Orioles offense on Tuesday. The bottom three guys in the order \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Lombardozzi, Flaherty, and Jonathan Schoop were a combined 8-for-15. That is when you know your team is having a good day!It is also great to see Matt Wieters hitting well at the beginning of this new season. This was one of the concerns coming into 2014 \xe2\x80\x93 that Wieters was never going to live up to the hopes for offensive output that were placed upon him when he first arrived in Baltimore. Right now he is batting .370 through the first eight games \xe2\x80\x93 10-for-27 with two homers and six RBIs.But not lost in the euphoria was another rather poor outing for an Orioles starter. Chen was able to get the win after pitching through five tortuous and torturous (twisting and painful) innings, giving up four runs on nine hits \xe2\x80\xa6 and now having an ERA of 6.75. This will have to change.The Orioles will be facing the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 new pitching sensation Masahiro Tanaka in the series finale on Wednesday evening. In only his second game, Tanaka won his first outing over the Blue Jays 7-3. He gave up two earned runs in seven innings of six-hit pitching, while recording eight strikeouts.Baltimore continues to look for a pitcher other than Chris Tillman to throw a decent game, and the next man up is Miguel Gonzalez. His first outing was difficult, as the Tigers drubbed him with seven runs on nine hits in just 3.1 innings of work.Gonzalez may draw some additional inner fortitude and strength in that he will certainly be cognizant of pitching on the fifth anniversary of the tragic death of his friend Nick Adenhart. The two knew each other from their days in the Angels organization, and Gonzalez used a glove belonging to Adenhart in his first start for the Orioles two years ago. In that Nick is from my town of Williamsport and was a classmate and friend of one of my sons, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have an additional article (to follow this one) on the Maryland native.In seven career games against the Yankees, Gonzalez is 2-2 with a 4.01 ERA. His WHIP is a very solid 1.17 and the batting average against is but .224 \xe2\x80\x93 all good numbers against New York. As can be seen in the chart below however, a number of the current Yankees have had some success against Gonzalez even considering the small sample size. Both Ichero Suzuki and Alfonso Soriano have a pair of homers off him.PAABH2B3BHRRBIBBSOBAOBPIchiro Suzuki20194102315.211.250Brett Gardner15124300022.333.429Derek Jeter12114010111.364.417Kelly Johnson1193100123.333.455Jacoby Ellsbury663100100.500.500Alfonso Soriano552002301.400.400Francisco Cervelli310000020.000.667 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles Take the Series in New York', 'Apr 9, 2014; Bronx, NY, USA; Baltimore Orioles second baseman Jonathan Schoop (6) is congratulated by Baltimore Orioles catcher Matt Wieters (32) after hitting a three run home run against the New York Yankees during the second inning at Yankee Stadium.

The Orioles keep producing in the 9th, and they tagged Shawn Kelley with numerous bloops to bring in two runs. Delmon Young turned in another solid game, going 3-5 with a double. Matt Wieters kept his hitting streak to start the season going as well. Eight of the nine Orioles that started had hits, only Nelson Cruz was hitless.

And he goes nowhere.\xc2\xa0 Ellsbury pops out in foul territory to Schoop and then Brian McCann hits it to Adam JonesThe BAD: Miguel Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s two solo home runs allowed.\xc2\xa0 Yes it didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose the Orioles the game, and it is always better that they are solo, but it is painful to watch them come right after the Orioles took a three run lead.\xc2\xa0 Also, the approach by several hitters was off tonight.\xc2\xa0 Nick Markakis decided he wanted to swing at the first pitch he saw from Tanaka in each at-bat. Because of it, he saw an average of less than two pitches an at-bat.\xc2\xa0 That is awful coming from your leadoff hitter.\xc2\xa0 Also, Tanaka used his nasty splitter to strike out the Orioles ten times, and several of those were on ugly at-bats.\xc2\xa0 None more so than Chris Davis, who with a man on swung at two pitches that bounced around the plate and then struck out looking.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it was only Steve Lombardozzi and Ryan Flaherty who did not strike out in the game.\xc2\xa0 The save wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly clean or pretty, but it ended up alright!What\xe2\x80\x99s NEXT: The Orioles get an off-day on Thursday before they come back to Baltimore to take on the Toronto Blue Jays (5-4 and play the Astros tomorrow at 7 p.m.) The matchup will feature Dustin McGowan vs. Bud Norris, at least that is who I expect to start.\xc2\xa0 Neither one looked good in their first starts, as both have ERAs of 9 and over.\xc2\xa0 As of writing this, the Jays are in the lead in the AL East, and are the only team over .500.\xc2\xa0 Which is surprising, considering that their team statistics are not good for either the hitters or the pitchers.

Still, the All-Star center fielder who is always at the ready with a not-so-safe opinion wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all that impressed by the young Japanese pitcher. Nick Markakis had an RBI single in the ninth inning against fill-in closer Shawn Kelley, and the Baltimore Orioles rallied for a 5-4 victory Wednesday night over the New York Yankees after wasting a three-run lead against Tanaka. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not the same hitters he faced over there. We groove, we hack,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jones, who struck out twice before getting a single in his three at-bats off Tanaka. Jonathan Schoop hit a soaring three-run homer off Tanaka in the second inning of the right-hander\xe2\x80\x99s first start at Yankee Stadium but Carlos Beltran and Kelly Johnson connected against Miguel Gonzalez in the bottom of the inning. Alfonso Soriano tied it with a groundout in the fourth. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just made a mistake, kept a slider up,\xe2\x80\x9d Schoop said. \xe2\x80\x9cI tried to make adjustments as he tried to elevate me, and then he made a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d The Orioles, who managed only seven hits while striking out 10 times against Tananka in seven innings, lined four straight hits to center field off Kelley, pitching the ninth for the second time in place of the injured David Robertson. Ryan Flaherty and Schoop each lined 0-2 pitches from Kelley (0-1) and Markakis singled in Flaherty and, after Delmon Young got his third hit of the night, Chris Davis made it 5-3 with a sacrifice fly. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt like they did a good job getting the barrel to some good pitches,\xe2\x80\x9d Kelly said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I bounced some of those balls, maybe they\xe2\x80\x99re swing and misses.\xe2\x80\x9d Tommy Hunter gave up two hits to start the ninth and a sacrifice fly to former Oriole Brian Roberts before getting Yangervis Solarte to ground into a double play for his third save, finishing off the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 second straight win over New York. Brian Matusz got two outs (1-0). Matusz has stranded 51 of 56 inherited runners dating to 2012, a major league best. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not always going to be pretty, you just look at the result,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. Jones came up to a smattering of boos before his first at-bat a day after he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThey should let us have a shot to kick `em with our metal spikes,\xe2\x80\x9d about two fans who ran on the field Tuesday. The fans\xe2\x80\x99 shenanigans got a huge cheer from the crowd. Jones fanned his first two times up to hardy cheers. Jones wasn\xe2\x80\x99t alone. Tanaka had the Orioles flailing at his nasty split-fingered fastball all night, many bouncing in the dirt. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is as good as advertised,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said of Tanaka. There were many empty seats on a brisk night in the Bronx despite it being New York\xe2\x80\x99s first chance to see the prized Tananka, who signed a seven-year, $155 million contract with the Yankees this winter \xe2\x80\x94 plus a $20 million rights fee paid to his team in Japan, Ratuken. Tanaka warmed up to the bubbly \xe2\x80\x9cMy Dear Fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d a song written for the 25-year-old pitcher by the Japanese group Momoiro Clover Z. He then received a rude welcome from Markakis. The Orioles leadoff batter grounded the first pitch of the game right back at Tanaka, hitting him on the foot before it deflected to shortstop Derek Jeter, who made the throw for the out. In similar fashion to his first big league start at Toronto, Tanaka was tagged early before settling in. He gave up three runs \xe2\x80\x94 two earned \xe2\x80\x94 in the first two innings Friday of a seven-inning outing in which he struck out eight. This time, Schoop hit a soaring three-run homer high above the left field pole in the second inning. But Tanaka gave up just three more singles and a walk. Gonzalez was equal to the task, allowing seven hits and three runs. He walked one and struck out three. NOTES: Tanaka\xe2\x80\x99s walk of Wieters in the third snapped a streak of five straight games in which the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 starter did not allow a walk. \xe2\x80\xa6 Orioles OF David Lough passed a concussion test in Baltimore earlier in the day. He came in as a defensive replacement in the ninth. Jemile Weeks was brought to the Bronx from Triple-A Norfolk and was in the clubhouse Wednesday in case Lough was placed on the disabled list. \xe2\x80\xa6 Orioles LHP Johan Santana (shoulder) will pitch BP Saturday in Sarasota, Fla. \xe2\x80\xa6 RHP Dylan Bundy (Tommy John surgery) threw 35 fastballs. Manager Buck Showalter said it went well. \xe2\x80\xa6 Up next: The Yankees begin a four-game series against Boston Thursday. Michael Pineda (1-0) makes his first Yankee Stadium start. The Orioles open a series against Toronto in Baltimore on Friday. (Copyright 2013 by The Associated Press.

You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to give him some credit, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it easy on him.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles pushed Tanaka to a draw with one swing from their own rookie, Jonathan Schoop, a 22-year-old infielder from Cura\xc3\xa7ao. With two on and two out in the second inning, Tanaka hung a slider and Schoop launched it down the left-field line, into a mostly empty section in the second deck for his second career home run.

They also took some wild swings on balls in the dirt, underscoring the quality of Tanaka\xe2\x80\x99s repertory. The Orioles expected him to be around the strike zone, and he was, walking just one.Jones disputed the idea that Tanaka had struggled, and asked rhetorically if Tanaka, who was 24-0 in the regular season in Japan last season, was supposed to be perfect.\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t happening here,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got good stuff, though.

He has 18 strikeouts in 14 innings, with a 3.21 earned run average.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cHe can pitch to all quadrants of the plate,\xe2\x80\x9d catcher Brian McCann said after the game. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can elevate you. He can change eye levels with a slider or a split. He\xe2\x80\x99s got all the pitches to be top of the rotation.\xe2\x80\x9dJones mentioned that the Orioles had already faced a few aces, like Justin Verlander and Jon Lester, and he did not declare Tanaka to be in their class. That caliber of pitcher, Jones said, was the standard Tanaka now faces in the American League, and particularly in the East, where all the teams look dangerous.Cruz, who played with Yu Darvish in Texas, said it was too early to compare Tanaka to Darvish. The Orioles were more comfortable comparing Tanaka to another Yankee, Hiroki Kuroda. They noticed the similarities when studying Tanaka\xe2\x80\x99s first start, in Toronto, and did not sound surprised by what they saw live.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cHim and Kuroda are very, very similar,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Kuroda throws a little more sinkers as opposed to Tanaka \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s more four-seamers \xe2\x80\x94 but very similar stuff. They\xe2\x80\x99re competitors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Jones added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe faced Kuroda a couple of days ago, so we knew a little of the similarities and we went over them before the game. We had an idea and tried to stick with our plan. It worked. We had a chance to get a little bit more off him, but we were able to get what we got.\xe2\x80\x9dThey got enough, from Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s blast, to chase Tanaka from the game with a tie score in the seventh. Tanaka might have lasted longer in Japan, but cutting off a start after 100 pitches is another adjustment over here.\xe2\x80\x9cI understand there\xe2\x80\x99s only four days in between starts, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a very long season,\xe2\x80\x9d Tanaka said through an interpreter. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to listen to what the team has to say.\xe2\x80\x9d  A version of this article appears in print on April 10, 2014, on Page B17 of the New York edition with the headline: Orioles Are Impressed, if Not Overly So, by a New Yankee.

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY SportsFrom time to time over the course of the season, here at The Baltimore Wire we will give some updates on the pitching rotations at AAA Norfolk and AA Bowie. In that pitching is such a big and critical part of the game of baseball, it is always good to be able to know what is just over the horizon in terms of future prospects to take the mound for the Baltimore Orioles.The system-wide emphasis on pitching is seen extending to the AA affiliate in Bowie, Maryland, where pitching coach Blaine Beatty has some great young arms to work with. Beyond that, Dylan Bundy could well be re-entering the sport through the Bowie Baysox before too long.Currently through seven games, Bowie is 5-2, with three of the top prospects in the Orioles system are a part of the current rotation \xe2\x80\xa6#3 prospect Eduardo Rodriguez \xe2\x80\x93 has been off to a bit of a rough start in his two games so far. He has given up four earned runs over five innings in both of his starts. Hopes are high for the young man who is still only age 21. He made it to Bowie at the end of last season, pitched especially well in Arizona for the fall league, and looked impressive in spring training big league camp.#6 prospect Tim Berry \xe2\x80\x93 Buck Showalter can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to stop talking about how impressed he is with the 23-year-old. Taken in the 50th round, he has already been through arm problems and Tommy John surgery \xe2\x80\x93 hence his low placement in the draft. His first outing was a fantastic seven innings of three-hit baseball. \xe2\x80\x9cThe change-up was working for me today,\xe2\x80\x9d Berry said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was commanding it well and it had better action than it usually has. You mix that with the fastball and that\xe2\x80\x99s really all you need to keep hitters off balance. My curveball I just kind of sprinkled in.\xe2\x80\x9d#11 prospect Zach Davies \xe2\x80\x93 Bowie pitching coach Blaine Beatty told me before spring training started that he was especially excited to work with Davies this year. Also at age 21, Davies is unusual for pitching prospects because of his size \xe2\x80\x93 listed at 6-0 and 150 pounds. He was a 26th-round pick in 2011, but has great control of his pitches. His first game was reasonably good with only two runs in five innings. This is his first shot at the AA level.Jake Pettit had a difficult start in his first outing, as the first five batters he faced hit five consecutive singles. He did manage to hold the damage to a total of four runs over four innings. Pettit is a career minor leaguer in the Orioles organization who has thrown a total of 491 innings with a 36-21 record and 3.77 ERA. He was a 42nd-round pick in 2010.Tyler Wilson threw six shutouts innings in his first start, giving up only three hits. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially in your first start of the year, it\xe2\x80\x99s great to get out there and get those nerves out of the way,\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou really want to find your rhythm early on, no matter what start, but especially in the first start of the year.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Wilson is a 2011 selection of the Orioles in the 10th round out of UVA. Now age 24, he spent most of last season with Bowie as he works through the O\xe2\x80\x99s farm system.Also getting a start was 27-year-old Matt Bischoff, a pitcher who spent most of 2013 with the Baysox, appearing in 25 games \xe2\x80\x93 all but one in relief. He was originally drafted by the Mariners out of Purdue University. He is a minor league free agent that was signed by the Orioles in January, 2012.

04/11/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The ballpark experience - Birds Watcher', 'Yesterday for the first time since March 30th, the Baltimore Orioles were off. But don\xe2\x80\x99t worry; the Birds are back in action tonight back at the yard against Toronto! In monitoring the first two weeks of league play, 0ne thing across Major League Baseball that\xe2\x80\x99s struck me is that there have been a few complaints about the experience at the ballpark. The O\xe2\x80\x99s have only played three games at home to this point, however I think that most people around here would agree that fans know what they\xe2\x80\x99re getting when they buy a ticket to Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Overall, I think that most fans would agree that not only\xc2\xa0is the in-game experience good in Baltimore, but that it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten better.But in reading various columns and even fan boards, I see a general level of contempt from fans across the league when they go to MLB games. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s long lines at the concession stands, bathrooms, ticket windows, etc., customer service issues, or anything else, it appears that teams are doing a better job of getting under fans\xe2\x80\x99 skin. So what gives? What should be done about this, and/or what can be done?This is always a tough sell because people come at this type of thing from different vantage points. However one common denominator I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in fan complaints is long lines at concession stands. Those types of things are universally seen as bad. Part of the problem is that many teams/vendor companies can\xe2\x80\x99t accurately predict what their attendance is going to be game in and game out. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to say that attendance is going to be lower in months such as April or September, or higher in general on weekends. However it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to gauge what kind of walk-up crowd a game is going to draw. So if they\xe2\x80\x99re expecting 15K and the game ends up drawing a huge walk-up crowd, odds are that staffing levels at concession stands, souvenir shops, etc. will be lower than necessary which will provide for longer waits.Unfortunately the age of the game itself being the only draw is probably over. For so many years fans would flock to Memorial Stadium \xe2\x80\x93 just to watch the game. But now with the concept of the \xe2\x80\x9cballpark experience,\xe2\x80\x9d people look for more than that. Again, for the most part I think that the Orioles do a good job with this. Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a casual fan or a die hard, one thing that is necessary is customer service. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about someone having to wait 20 minutes for a hot dog, I\xe2\x80\x99m referring more to just the overall attitude of the workers at the park. If ushers are rude or cop attitudes with fans, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to dissuade people from coming back. Granted when you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with the general public that\xe2\x80\x99s not always easy, however believe it or not that might well be the easiest part of improving the ballpark experience.Going back to lines at the concession stands for a moment, many of the newer parks actually have open concourses now (Nationals Park in Washington, along with Harbor Park in Norfolk \xe2\x80\x93 home of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 triple-A team \xe2\x80\x93 are two examples). While it\xe2\x80\x99s not perfect, that might help to alleviate some of the \xe2\x80\x9cpain\xe2\x80\x9d for fans associated with missing part of the game. Granted I remember when it was novel to have televisions or the radio feed pipped into the concourse, however the fact is that\xe2\x80\x99s no longer good enough. Fans pay to see the game in person, not on TV in the concourse area.Courtesy of Bob DeChiara-US PRESSWIREUltimately teams probably need to take a look at how their gameday experience operates across the board. It\xe2\x80\x99s also worthwhile for executives to take in games as fans at other parks, just to see if they can catch onto things that other teams are doing and so forth. This is not to say that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t already happen, however it\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad idea. I say all of this fully recognizing that in some cases people\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions can be based on things beyond the team or anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s control. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard fans in other sports complainin that \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xc2\xa0[insert team name]\xc2\xa0need to do something about the construction on the roads outside the stadium.

', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Blue Jays 2, Orioles 0: The defense sucks, the baserunning ...', "" These are the kinds of games that make you hate baseball. \xc2\xa0Or hate Manny Machado and J.J. Hardy for being hurt. \xc2\xa0Or hate Buck Showalter for putting the weakest defender of the three reserves who must start at the hot corner. \xc2\xa0No matter who you choose to hate, you hate the Orioles, because Chris Tillman's brilliant, ace-like outing was wasted on a game full of bad defense, bad baserunning and all-around bad baseballing.    Let's start with Chris Tillman, because Chris Tillman didn't suck. \xc2\xa0At all. \xc2\xa0Chris Tillman threw eight brilliant innings, allowing zero earned runs with six K's to just one walk, and needed just 105 pitches to do it. \xc2\xa0And he basically would've thrown a nine-inning shutout if not for the defense, but we'll get to that. \xc2\xa0Aside from getting into a few too many two- and three-ball counts in the early innings, there was absolutely nothing to criticize about Tillman's pitching tonight. \xc2\xa0He had the Blue Jays off-balance and hitting into weak contact all night long. Not to take anything away from Tillman's counterpart, Dustin McGowan, who pitched a hell of a game himself. \xc2\xa0McGowan allowed more baserunners than Tillman, throwing 6 1/3 scoreless with five hits, one walk and just two strikeouts, but he kept the Orioles off-balance as well. \xc2\xa0The Orioles got some warning-track flyballs, and they gifted McGowan a scoreless inning (more on that in a moment as well), but he did what he needed to do and the Orioles didn't make him pay for any of his mistakes. The fourth and fifth innings were the pivotal moments in this game. \xc2\xa0In the fourth inning, the Orioles defense suddenly chose to remind us that Manny Machado and J.J. Hardy are really important to the Orioles defense. \xc2\xa0Both Blue Jays runs in the game were unearned, and there were three awful throws to allow them, even though only two errors showed up on the scorecard. \xc2\xa0First, Jose Bautista reached base on a grounder to third. \xc2\xa0Jonathan Schoop's throw sailed over Chris Davis's head to allow the runner onto base. \xc2\xa0After a clean single from Edwin Encarnacion put runners on first and second, Schoop made another throwing error on an Adam Lind grounder, letting Bautista score. \xc2\xa0The indignity was complete on a tailor-made double-play ball where Ryan Flaherty bounced the second throw past Chris Tillman, who was covering first base, allowing the second run to score when the inning should have ended.    Schoop might be the young guy on the roster right now, but I hope he's buying Tillman a nice steak tomorrow. For all that the defense let the team down, baserunning blunders didn't help. \xc2\xa0If the defense had supported Tillman's sturdy pitching performance, a smart fifth inning could've granted the Orioles a run. \xc2\xa0With two outs, the team put up consecutive well-hit singles from Nick Markakis, Delmon Young and Chris Davis. \xc2\xa0But on Davis's single, third base coach Bobby Dickerson held up Nick Markakis at third, while right fielder Bautista came up slowly and threw to third, assuming that Markakis was an automatic run. \xc2\xa0Adam Jones came up with the bases loaded and lofted a soft fly ball to center to end the two-out rally. There's an alternate reality where the Orioles won an exciting pitcher's duel, 1-0, based on sturdy defense, timely hitting and sharp baserunning. \xc2\xa0Then there's the reality I ended up in, where I hate everything. \xc2\xa0Chris Tillman, you are awesome. \xc2\xa0The rest of you Orioles have officially let me down.

Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsAfter Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s off day, the season continues on Friday evening with game 10 against the Toronto Blue Jays. The Baltimore Orioles have won three of the past four games to pull themselves to a record of 4-5 in the AL East, where all five teams are within a game of each other. The Orioles will look to improve upon their 10-9 record against the Jays in 2013.The day off allows the Orioles to pitch Chris Tillman in the opening game of the series on his normal five-day schedule. Bud Norris will bump back with two extra days and pitch on Saturday, while Ubaldo Jimenez goes Sunday with one extra day.The most recent two games in New York seemed to feature the rediscovery of the Orioles offense, and that makes all the difference. The bottom of the order has been especially effective, and I suppose that any team that had their 7-8-9 hitters go 12-for-27 over a two-day period is going to have a lot of success.It is also presumed that J.J. Hardy will likely be recovered sufficiently from his back spasm issues to play again, and likewise David Lough has hopefully put the concussion-like symptoms behind him and can play at a high level.The Orioles will be facing Toronto hurler Dustin McGowan in the first game of the series. Other than Adam Jones being 4-for-5 off him, there is not much else in terms of optimistic numbers \xe2\x80\xa6 though few have faced him many times. However, Delmon Young is only 1-for-14, Nick Markakis is 0-for-10, and Nelson Cruz 0-for-5. Ryan Flaherty has a homer in two at bats, and he will surely be facing McGowan.PAABH2B3BHRRBIBBSOBADelmon Young14121000113.083Nick Markakis12101000021.100Nelson Cruz540000002.000J.J.

In the final game against Detroit and Justin Verlander, Tillman pitched what might have been his best game ever \xe2\x80\x93 going 8.1 innings and giving up only a solo homer and one run on five hits. This followed his opening day start against Boston with a run over five innings. So his current ERA is 1.35.Over his career, Chris Tillman is 3-3 in 10 games against the Jays, with an ERA of 3.86 and an excellent WHIP of 1.170. A number of the Toronto hitters have pretty decent career numbers against him. Cody Rasmus is 6-for-14 with two homers, while Jose Bautista is 6-for-18 with two long balls as well\xe2\x80\xa6PAABH2B3BHRRBIBBSOBAAdam Lind29278000227.296Edwin Encarnacion26257101113.280Jose Bautista21186102428.333Colby Rasmus14146202401.429Brett Lawrie13133001103.231Melky Cabrera12113101402.273Ryan Goins661000101.167Maicer Izturis320000010.000Dioner Navarro220000001.000\xc2\xa0So even though the long-term career numbers favor McGowan in this game, I am thinking the more recent performances of each gives Chris Tillman and the Orioles in Camden Yards the advantage.

Steinbrenner Field. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsFrom time to time over the course of the season, here at The Baltimore Wire we will give some updates on the pitching rotations at AAA Norfolk and AA Bowie. In that pitching is such a big and critical part of the game of baseball, it is always good to be able to know what is just over the horizon in terms of future prospects to take the mound for the Baltimore Orioles.It has been presumed that the Orioles are rather well-armed with high-level pitching prospects and that the AAA Norfolk rotation was going to be rather outstanding. So far, that has been a mixed bag of results. The team is not hitting particularly well other than Jemile Weeks and Caleb Joseph, and they are off to a 3-5 start through the first eight games. (Caleb Joseph had a 12th-inning two-run double last night to make a winner out of newly-acquired pitcher Preston Guilmet.)Tides manager Ron Johnson stated at the beginning of the season that his rotation was going to go in this order: Kevin Gausman, Steve Johnson, T.J. McFarland, Suk-min Yoon, and Mike Wright. This plan was upset before it even started, as weather uncertainties in Detroit caused fears of a possible Orioles-Tigers double header last Saturday (which did not eventuate) and Gausman was pulled from the opener to head toward Michigan. Eddie Gamboa made the start for Norfolk instead. He pitched well, allowing two runs in five innings \xe2\x80\x93 those runs coming on a two-run homer with two outs in the 5th inning. We\xe2\x80\x99ll mention Gamboa again later.Of the starting rotation so far this year \xe2\x80\xa6Kevin Gausman \xe2\x80\x93 Considered the #2 Orioles prospect, he is clearly on a strict pitch count around 70-75. His first start went 4.2 scoreless innings with three hits, two walks, and six strikeouts. His second start was more difficult with two earned runs over four innings with four hits and two walks.Steve Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 He threw 55 pitches in his first outing, doing so over three innings with three hits and a run given up. His second outing on Friday night was more difficult. In 4.2 innings he was touched up for four runs on four hits \xe2\x80\x93 two of them homers, raising his ERA to 5.87.T.J. McFarland \xe2\x80\x93 The Orioles Rule 5 draftee from last year had a very good first start and will pitch again Saturday. Over four innings he gave up one run on four hits, while striking out five.Suk-min Yoon \xe2\x80\x93 This is not encouraging. Lasting only 2.1 innings, Gwinnett got to him for nine earned runs on 11 hits. That translates to a 34.71 ERA. Hopefully he had food poisoning or something like that affecting him. My readers may recall that I have not been an optimistic person about Yoon, though I want to be terribly wrong about my fears. Eddie Gamboa game into the game and went 5.2 scoreless innings to bring things under control. As you can see in the chart below, Gamboa now has an ERA of 1.69.David Wright \xe2\x80\x93 The Orioles Minor League Pitcher of the Year in 2013 had a very strong first start, going five innings and giving up but one run on five hits.

Absalon, USA TODAY Sports)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles had to go into extra innings to earn a victory that seemed assured far earlier in the night.Working overtime, however, did nothing to temper the enjoyment they derived from a 2-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday.BOX SCORE: Orioles 2, Blue Jays 1 (12 innings)Steve Lombardozzi tripled and scored on a single by David Lough in the 12th inning for the Orioles, who also got a key RBI from rookie Jonathan Schoop.Toronto trailed 1-0 with two outs in the ninth when Colby Rasmus hit a solo homer off Tommy Hunter on a 1-2 pitch. After nearly going around on a check swing one pitch earlier, Rasmus drove a 98 mph fastball into the right-field seats.""He hit a pretty good fastball,"" Hunter said. ""Sometimes you just tip your cap. He swung at a ball that was up. It was where I wanted. We talked about it afterward. One-run ballgame, you should probably throw the ball down and away instead of up, and he hit it.""In the 12th, Lombardozzi hit a one-out drive to center off Todd Redmond (0-1) before Lough sliced an opposite-field liner to left. As soon as Lombardozzi crossed the plate, the Orioles sprinted from the dugout to embrace Lough, who scored Baltimore\'s other run five innings earlier.""It looked like we were going to wrap it up there but unfortunately they got a run,"" Lough said. ""But we just buckled down, stayed in the game, kept our heads up and we were able to come through with the hit.""Zach Britton (2-0) got the win with two hitless innings of relief.It was the second straight low-scoring affair between two AL East foes known for their offensive prowess. On Friday night, Toronto scored two unearned runs in a 2-0 victory.In this one, neither starter allowed a run and neither got a victory for the effort. Bud Norris gave up five hits and three walks over seven innings for Baltimore and was poised to earn his first win of the season before Rasmus connected in the ninth.""It didn\'t really do nothing for us,"" Rasmus lamented. ""Most of the time when I face a guy who throws 98 (mph), I\'m going to look for the fastball hoping that guy\'s going to challenge.""Drew Hutchison handcuffed the Orioles on four hits over six innings, walking two and striking out five.""I have all the confidence in the world in our offense, just like the rest of our team does,"" the right-hander said. ""It doesn\'t change my mindset one bit. My job is to go out and put up zeros.""After Hutchison left, the Orioles struck in the seventh against right-hander Neil Wagner. Lough singled with two outs before Schoop, the No. 9 hitter, lined a 3-2 pitch into the alley in right-center for an RBI double.Evan Meek protected the lead in the eighth, but Hunter gave it away for his first blown save in four tries this season.""You hopefully get a chance tomorrow,"" Hunter said. ""The guys pulled it off, the team came through in the 12th. It\'s not a one-man show. There are a lot of guys, and I got picked up tonight.""The game featured the first replay challenge at Camden Yards. In the fourth inning, Lombardozzi reached on a grounder when umpire Chris Conroy ruled that a throw from Hutchison pulled first baseman Edwin Encarnacion off the bag. Toronto manager John Gibbons challenged the call, and after a delay of 2 minutes, 38 seconds, the decision stood.Lough followed by hitting into an inning-ending double play.Both teams threatened in the third. Toronto put runners at the corners with one out before Maicer Izturis hit a short flyball and Jose Bautista struck out.In the bottom half, Hutchison struck out Chris Davis and Adam Jones after giving up successive one-out singles to Nick Markakis and Nelson Cruz.NOTES: Ubaldo Jimenez (0-2, 6.75 ERA) seeks his first win with the Orioles on Sunday.

It\xe2\x80\x99s on me, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned my lesson. I take a peek and see where my infielders are at.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles used 595 shifts on balls in play last season, the most in the five seasons tracked by Baseball Info Solutions.Teams shifted about 2,400 times in 2010 and 2011, said Ben Jedlovec, a vice president for the company, and about 4,500 times in 2012. Last season, the total jumped to about 8,100, and teams are on pace for 13,000 shifts in 2014.

Entering the weekend, data showed that 23 of the 30 teams were on pace to deploy more shifts than they did last year.As teams compile more and more information on hitters\xe2\x80\x99 trends, managers can predict more accurately than ever where ground balls are most likely to go.\xe2\x80\x9cAs I told Brad when he joined us, we can supply you any statistical information you like, and it\xe2\x80\x99s up to you to do what you want with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Dombrowski said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to force it down players\xe2\x80\x99 throats, but he wants to show them why it\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Houston Astros entered the weekend on pace to use the most shifts this season, followed by the Yankees, the Milwaukee Brewers, the Orioles and the Chicago White Sox, who ranked 27th last year.

Credit             Orlin Wagner/Associated Press           Bryan Price, the new manager of the Cincinnati Reds, said he watched a recent Yankees-Astros game and noticed the infielders shifting within the same at-bat. Price said that strategy seemed to disrupt the flow of the game, but he also acknowledged it could be smart.

There are some real pioneers out there that have taken the data and utilized it.\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s that age-old thing: Every time you\xe2\x80\x99re burned by it, you remember that as opposed to the 10 other times it worked for you. And if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about percentages, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get beat. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to have Matt Adams cue one right down the left-field line on a squibber.\xe2\x80\x9dSure enough, just as Adams, of the St. Louis Cardinals, had beaten the Reds\xe2\x80\x99 shift, the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 Ike Davis did so last Sunday a couple of hours after Price spoke. The Reds won that game, though, and were ranked 10th in the majors in shifts, up from 13th last season.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Price, who was promoted from pitching coach to replace Dusty Baker, said the Reds made sure their pitchers agreed with the strategy before using it behind them. If a pitcher is more comfortable with a traditional infield alignment, he said, the Reds will go with that, no matter what the numbers suggest.

The job of the pitcher, he said, is the same as always.

Credit             Jared Wickerham/Getty Images           Dr. James Andrews, the noted orthopedic surgeon, said the problem was not an anomaly but a troubling trend, mainly because of the popularity of youth travel teams and summer showcases. Last week, on MLB Network Radio, Andrews told Mike Ferrin and Jim Duquette that he had been \xe2\x80\x9cinundated\xe2\x80\x9d with high school and college pitchers needing elbow reconstruction.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cThe big risk factor is year-round baseball,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrews, who saw Moore last week. \xe2\x80\x9cThese kids are not just throwing year round, they\xe2\x80\x99re competing year round, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have any time for recovery. More is better. So year-round baseball is No. 1.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cNo. 2 is playing in more than one league at the same time, where rules don\xe2\x80\x99t count. And, of course, in showcases, where they\xe2\x80\x99re pitching for scouts, they try to overpitch and they get hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Andrews also cited poor mechanics and pitchers throwing breaking balls at a young age. But the main problem, he emphasized, was that youngsters were throwing too hard too soon. Anything beyond 80 to 85 miles per hour, Andrews said, is more than a developing elbow ligament can handle.\xe2\x80\x9cThe radar gun\xe2\x80\x99s a problem,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.

So my mom actually took me to the police station to scare me a little bit.\xe2\x80\x9cThe police officer, I remember he asked me what my name was, and I thought if I told him my real name, I\xe2\x80\x99d get arrested. I was so young and scared. So I made up a name and said, \xe2\x80\x98Scooter.\xe2\x80\x99 That was the only name I really knew at the time. That was my favorite character. And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer to Ryan for about a year because I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d get in trouble and get arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Scooter is a character from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Muppet Show\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 round glasses, orange skin, no nose and a mop of orange hair. He is not a headliner like Kermit the Frog, but Gennett \xe2\x80\x94 himself more a complementary player than a superstar \xe2\x80\x94 connected with him while watching reruns after school.Gennett is not the first middle infielder to go by Scooter; Phil Rizzuto, the Hall of Fame shortstop and longtime Yankees broadcaster, was perhaps the original. Gennett said it sounded good as a baseball name, but he uses it everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9cSome of the teachers were like: \xe2\x80\x98What? I\xe2\x80\x99m not calling you that,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut eventually, they did. It started off as Ryan, but they ended up calling me Scooter.

The Orioles defeated the Blue Jays 2-1 in twelve innings. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsUnlike me, I realize most of you reading this cannot remember professional baseball in the 1960s, though you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the stories of Brooks Robinson, Paul Blair and Boog Powell, etc. You know of Frank Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s Triple Crown in 1966.What made the offensive exploits of these players so impressive is that much of it was done in an era where offense was at a premium. The statistics from that time show amazingly low numbers for pitching ERA, with correspondingly low numbers for top batting averages.In 1968, the average total runs-per-game was 6.8, compared to about 8.5 in recent years. There were 1.2 home runs per game in 1968, compared to 1.8 or 1.9 recently. In 1968 \xe2\x80\x93 the year of Bob Gibson\xe2\x80\x99s 1.12 ERA \xe2\x80\x93 the major league batting average was .237, compared to over .250 nowadays. The average MLB pitching ERA then was 2.98, compared to over 3.90 now.In the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first world championship year of 1966, here are the top five hitters and top five pitchers in the American League\xe2\x80\xa61. Robinson (BAL) .3162. Oliva (MIN) .3073. Kaline (DET) .2884. Powell (BAL) .2875. Killebrew (MIN) .281\xc2\xa01. Peters (CHW) 1.982. Horlen (CHW) 2.433. Hargan (CLE) 2.484. Perry (MIN) 2.545. John (CHW) 2.62\xc2\xa0Here is my point: I grew up loving baseball at a time when it was more of a low-scoring, pitchers battle \xe2\x80\xa6 where 1-0 and 2-1 games were much more common. After the \xe2\x80\x9968 season it was so much this way that the pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s mound was lowered from 15 inches to 10 inches in order to take away the huge pitching advantage.So, these past two Orioles games \xe2\x80\x93 a 2-0 loss with unearned runs scored against them, and last night\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1, 12-inning win \xe2\x80\x93 look and feel a lot more like the 1960s than the current era \xe2\x80\xa6 though understand, I\xe2\x80\x99m not craving any return to those days!The Baltimore Orioles had the Blue Jays down to their final strike last night, and in fact it was after the final uncalled strike on a (non) check swing, by Colby Rasmus. The fans were standing, having gathered their belongings in the 9th inning with the Orioles winning 1-0, when Rasmus turned around a Tommy Hunter 97-mph fast ball and put it over the fence.Fortunately a triple by Steve Lombardozzi put him at third base with one in the bottom of the 12th out so that David Lough could single him home for the 2-1 victory.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how many people noticed on the replay of the triple that the Orioles finally got a break. The ball hit on a seam between two outfield panels and bounced oddly to the side rather than straight back at the outfielder. Lombo saw this and kicked into an extra gear for the critical extra base.More 60s-like baseball \xe2\x80\x93 where every base counts!Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Ubaldo Battles BuehrleThis afternoon, Toronto will send 35-year-old Mark Buehrle to the mound.

He has had some of the nastiest-looking pitches with incredible movement, but will then leave a flat pitch in the middle of the plate.Jimenez is 0-2 as an Oriole in his first two starts against Boston and New York. His ERA for 10.2 innings is 6.75.Against the Blue Jays in his career, Ubaldlo has pitched five games and is 2-1 with a 4.61 ERA.

But I know it\'s part of the game. I can\'t give up, I can\'t put my head down and feel sorry for myself.""Orioles manager Buck Showalter remains hopeful the right-hander will ultimately flash the form that enabled him to go 13-9 over 32 starts with Cleveland last year.""If you look at his, kind of, history, he gets better as the year goes on,"" Showalter said. ""You trust the person and the character. He\'s in good standing where that\'s concerned. He\'ll keep fighting.

""I don\'t know what\'s going on.""The Blue Jays took a 3-1 lead in the fourth. Lind walked on four pitches and took third when a ball girl near the left-field seats mistakenly gloved Encarnacion\'s grounder inside the third base line. Dioner Navarro followed with a run-scoring groundout and Jonathan Diaz executed a perfect suicide squeeze on a pitch that came in at eye level.Toronto pulled away with a five-run seventh, its biggest inning of the year. Lawrie hit a solo shot before Rasmus and Encarnacion hit two-run doubles off Josh Stinson.Rasmus put Toronto up 1-0 in the first inning with his second home run in two games, a towering drive that became the 78th in the 23-year history of Camden Yards to land on Eutaw Street beyond the right field wall.Baltimore pulled even in the bottom half when Nick Markakis singled and scored on a groundout by Adam Jones.

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsThe Orioles (5-7) have struggled on both ends of the field so far in 2014. Whether it be pitching or hitting, there is certainly room for improvement as we head into the third week of the season. Many fans feel it is still too early to accurately gauge either side of the field and will argue that there is still plenty of baseball left to play, but I argue that this stretch of disappointing baseball should still be considered significant.Yes, there is plenty of time to turn the ship around. The Orioles could go on a win streak and make fans forget all about the past two weeks. But fans really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget this stretch moving forward, because these problems could pop up periodically throughout the season.Through the first 12 games, Orioles pitchers have a combined 4.50 ERA (13th in AL) and the starters have contributed the most to the struggles.Ubaldo Jimenez (0-3, 7.31), Miguel Gonzalez (0-1, 9.64), and Wei-Yin Chen (1-1, 6.75) have been the weakest links thus far. Most recently Jimenez lasted just 5.1 innings and gave up five earned runs on 10 hits and two walks against the Toronto Blue Jays. The rotation\xe2\x80\x99s struggles, especially Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s, demonstrate the type of struggles the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 rotation is capable of falling into. They could implode at any moment and bring on a losing streak right in the midst of a playoff run, and that has to worry the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 brass.But then again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to win at all if your team doesn\xe2\x80\x99t score runs.\xc2\xa0The Orioles are right in the middle of the AL rankings when it comes to scoring runs, tallying 46 runs (T-7 in AL). Combined with a .256 team AVG (3rd in AL), their numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t seem all too disheartening, but a closer look reveals some early weak spots. In eight of their first 12 games, the Orioles have scored three or less runs. It is hard for any pitcher to win on a team that struggles to get more than three runs in a game.Chris Davis (.279/.353/.419) just hit his first home run on Sunday in a mop-up scenario and has struck out 12 times already, Nick Markakis (.269/.278/.327) has just two extra-base hits and has failed to be an adequate leadoff hitter, and the combination of Jonathan Schoop (.244/.244/.415) and Ryan Flaherty (.152/.200/.212) has failed to give the bottom of the order any stability.Obviously, injuries to J.J Hardy, David Lough and Manny Machado have made for an inconsistent bottom of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 order, and forced some players into positions that they should not be. But the struggles seen so far don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to too many championship-type teams. The Orioles scored just five runs in the entire Blue Jays series, a testament to the type of offensive funk this lineup can fall into in the snap of a finger.The Orioles are far from perfect, yes. Thankfully, most of the teams in the AL East have problems of their own that should help the Orioles from falling too far behind the pack if their struggles continue. However, it is clear that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 hitting and pitching have some serious issues that could create problems at any given point in the season.

The Orioles had 13 hits, including five doubles.""A lot of big two-out hits, a lot of big RBIs with guys on second,"" Wieters said. ""It wasn\'t really the long ball that did it tonight, but we found a way to win.""It was by far the poorest of Archer\'s 30 big league starts.

""I just made too many mistakes \xe2\x80\x94 and that\'s a good lineup.""The performance came less than two weeks after the Rays gave Archer a six-year contract that guarantees the right-hander $25.5 million.""If there is anything to take away from this game, I think it\'s how positive and encouraging my teammates were,"" Archer said. ""They fully believe in me, and when I came out they all said, \'In five days, you\'re going to make somebody pay.\'""Chen was facing a Tampa Bay team that has been struggling at the plate. The Rays have scored only 14 runs in their last eight games and have tallied three runs or fewer in seven of the last eight.""We did hit some balls well. Our geometry is really bad right now. We\'re hitting balls at people,"" manager Joe Maddon said. ""We just have to keep going up there and battling through it. It\'s just one of those bad periods.""Tampa Bay\'s only run came in the sixth inning when Zobrist walked and scored on a single by Evan Longoria.The outcome, however, was decided long before that.Wieters gave the Orioles a 1-0 lead with a two-out RBI single in the first inning, and Baltimore added three runs in the second. Hardy doubled and Flaherty sliced an RBI single past the drawn-in infield before Nelson Cruz and Chris Davis delivered run-scoring doubles.Doubles by Wieters and Hardy, followed by Steve Lombardozzi\'s RBI single, made it 6-0 in the third.Singles by Wieters, Hardy and Flaherty gave the Orioles a 7-0 cushion in the fifth. The seven runs were more than the Orioles scored in 11 of their previous 12 games.""It\'s nice to go out there and pitch like we did, hit like we did,"" Hardy said. ""It\'s just good to play a good game.""NOTES: RHP Jake Odorizzi, scheduled to start Tuesday night for Tampa Bay, experienced flu-like symptoms and was sent back to the team hotel as a precaution. It appeared to be the same virus that sidelined Rays reliever Joel Peralta last weekend. ... Miguel Gonzalez is slated to start for the Orioles on what is projected to be a cold, wet Tuesday evening. ... Orioles 3B Manny Machado (knee) ran six 90-foot sprints in Florida and is slated to run from home to second base Tuesday, Showalter said. ...

However, the two did not discover one another in the Copper State.    When Hardy was a member of the Brewers, his teammates were watching the Women\'s College World Series. Other players on the team noticed where Acton was from and insisted that Hardy get in touch with her. After some convincing he talked to the Brewer\'s public relations department. They contacted the University of Arizona and the rest is history.    Oh, and Hardy has made a well-documented appearance on The Young and the Restless along with, Jeff Suppan, Chris Capuano and former Oriole Bill Hall. Capuano is referred to as ""the best left-handed pitcher in the entire league."" You want to watch this. Professional History After being drafted in 2001, Hardy climbed the organizational ranks with Milwaukee, breaking into the bigs in 2005. While down on the farm the player who some called ""Hoover"" in high school showed every ounce of defensive prowess we see today. He was rated the best defensive infielder and the best infield arm in the Brewer\'s system following the 2004 season. Baseball America ranked Hardy as high as the number 19 prospect in all of baseball.    In his six season with the Brewers, Hardy showed some brilliance. He made his first All-Star game in 2007 at the age of 24. The follow up season of 2008 was even better and, arguably, his best year to date. He managed career highs in batting average (.283) and on base percentage (.343) that year. Hardy struggled after that great 2008. All of his stats took a dive and at one point he was optioned to Triple A. Following the season Hardy was dealt to the Minnesota Twins for outfielder Carlos Gomez. In Minnesota, Hardy couldn\'t find his power in spacious Target Field. On top of that, he injured his wrist and missed 45 games in 2010, which is the reason he still wears a wrist guard running the bases to this day. He played for the Twins at the same time as new Oriole Delmon Young. It was really a forgettable year for the Arizona native.    It was that magical offseason of 2010 when the Orioles solved their longtime hole at shortstop by swapping Jim Hoey and Brett Jacobson for Hardy and fellow infielder Harris. Since this trade, J.J. has had a career rebirth; winning two Gold Gloves, earning another All-Star selection and winning a Silver Slugger award. Scouting Report Those two Gold Gloves aren\'t the only proof that Hardy is a superb defender. FanGraphs gives him a career zone rating per 150 games played at 9.9; that\'s great. But, as anyone who follows the Orioles can tell you, Hardy\'s foot speed is well below average. He will make the occasional spectacular play, but what makes him great is that he is almost assuredly going to make the routine play. The best way to describe it is that when a ball is hit to Hardy with two outs, it\'s safe for Adam Jones and Nick Markakis to begin their trek back to the dugout; the out will be recorded. The fact that Hardy plays shortstop makes his bat much more valuable. FanGraphs says that in 2013 AL shortstops had a line of .256/.309/.373. Those numbers are very similar to Hardy\'s career in terms of batting average (.259) and on-base percentage (.312). However, the one tool the Baltimore shortstop has that many of his peers don\'t, aside from Troy Tulowitzski in the NL, is power. Hardy slugged .433 in 2013 with 25 home runs. That was tied for the tops in baseball among shortstops and he wad third in runs batted in. Sure, Hardy has deficiencies at the plate. He doesn\'t walk nearly enough. Perhaps he hits a few too many fly balls. But if his approach changes he would lose what makes him valuable. Many of those fly balls fly right out of the park. The bottom line is that the Orioles are lucky to have a player like Hardy. Award winning shortstops don\'t grow on trees. Remember we were all excited about Luis Hernandez? What\'s Ahead? Hardy has had back issues to begin the 2014 campaign. If those are behind him (apologies for the pun) then he should have another stellar season. His value as a stabilizing force on the infield can\'t be overstated. The question is what uniform will Hardy be wearing come April of 2015.    Reports abound about the Orioles desire to resign the shortstop, but little has been brought up since the beginning of the season. Hardy would be a highly sought after talent if he were to hit free agency. That will only drive his price farther skyward. A certain New York franchise has their own number two retiring this fall. It will come down to the Orioles decision. Hardy has quickly become a fan favorite and has been saying all of the right things about wanting to stay in Baltimore. However, Manny Machado\'s skill set would still seem to fit best at shortstop. Would Hardy be willing to switch to third? As I alluded to above, his value would be greatly diminished if he moved away from short. Much of this will depend on both the health of Machado\'s knee and Hardy\'s back.

04/16/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Instant replay - Birds Watcher', 'Last night\xe2\x80\x99s game against Tampa was rained out. I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing that most fans weren\xe2\x80\x99t idly waiting by their computers or TV\xe2\x80\x99s all day just to see if the game was going to be played. All I needed to know was that I got drenched walking to my car to know that baseball wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be played! The O\xe2\x80\x99s and Tampa will make up the game on Thursday, June 26th, which will be in advance of what was previously a three-game weekend series at Camden Yards. Speaking for myself, I think this is a better solution than having the teams play a doubleheader today.With that said, I wanted to touch just a bit on MLB\xe2\x80\x99s Instant Replay system. We really don\xe2\x80\x99t have any evidence as to how it\xe2\x80\x99s working out for the Baltimore Orioles, as the Birds are the league\xe2\x80\x99s only team that has not challenged a call. However opposing managers are 0-3 on challenges against the Orioles, so in that sense I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s working! However I\xe2\x80\x99m talking big picture here more so than I am about the Orioles or any one team. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always felt that it was worth delaying the game for a few minutes to get calls right. Furthermore, do manager arguments not sometimes take two minutes or so?The reason I bring this up is because I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen numerous complaints from fans in terms of the amount of time the system takes. Furthermore, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard complaints regarding things such as the old \xe2\x80\x9cneighborhood play\xe2\x80\x9d at second base among other things. Here\xe2\x80\x99s my take on instant replay: I think it should be expanded. So far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned, the only thing which shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to be reviewed should be balls and strikes. (And even in that case, I\xe2\x80\x99d have no problem with a manager having the ability to challenge whether a hitter checked his swing in time.) So far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned, why not review the neighborhood play? Why not allow a review on whether or not a ball bounced over the bag?One issue that has come up in Oriole games is that there have been calls which have the semblance of being blown, but ultimately there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0conclusive evidence to overturn the call that was made on the field (to use the NFL\xe2\x80\x99s terminology). That\xe2\x80\x99s an inherent flaw in any instant replay system; it\xe2\x80\x99s never going to be 100% foolproof. But so far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned, if you have the ammo you might as well use it.If there\xe2\x80\x99s one criticism that I could make, it would be that in some cases perhaps the conversations are taking a bit too much time. Note that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say the reviews themselves, but the conversations. As it stands right now, managers are allowed to saunter out of the dugout as if on a Sunday afternoon stroll (so that their video guys have the opportunity to look at the play). They\xe2\x80\x99re then given the option of chatting with the umpire for awhile before he finally says\xc2\xa0do you want to challenge? Perhaps the umps need to start asking that question a bit earlier, because it seems like they\xe2\x80\x99re allowing the managers to make the decision in their own time. Either that, or perhaps MLB should put a cap on the amount of time allowed for these chats \xe2\x80\x93 such as 30 seconds or so. We\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about an exact science here, however if people are concerned about how long this is taking perhaps they could re-evaluate that aspect of it.The Orioles and Tampa will conclude their now-truncated series with an afternoon matinee at 12:30 today.

04/17/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: What roster moves are coming?', 'The Orioles broke camp with the more out-of-options players on their 25-man roster than any other team in baseball. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave the flexibility Orioles fans have come to expect from a Buck Showalter club, and so far this season hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen many roster moves. However, with Troy Patton and Manny Machado nearing returns, the Orioles are going to be forced to make some difficult decisions.It was reported earlier this week that Manny Machado will begin running the bases. It seems to be the last logical step for his rehabbing knee. If all goes well, Machado could be playing simulated games next week, and before long entering a minor league rehab assignment. The Orioles would love to have him back sooner rather than later, but they will remain cautious not to rush their young star back. Once he does return the Orioles will be forced to make room for him on the 25-man roster.The obvious choice would seem to be Steve Pearce. With the late addition of Nelson Cruz, and Delmon Young making the club out of spring training, Pearce seems to be the odd man out. So far Buck has struggled to find at-bats for the right-hander, and with the other right-handed hitters on the club, Pearce doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to fill a discernible need. \xc2\xa0However, Pearce is out of options and would be forced to pass through waivers where the Orioles would likely lose him. If the Orioles can\xe2\x80\x99t make a deal with somebody, they\xe2\x80\x99ll likely hold on to Pearce.If the Orioles elect to hang on to Pearce, the next logical solution may be to send down Jonathan Schoop. The Orioles seem to like the versatility of Steve Lombardozzi and Ryan Flaherty, who have experience playing multiple positions at the major league level. There is no doubting Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s talent and athleticism, but he has struggled at times this season. He could probably benefit from a few more at-bats at AAA. Lombardozzi and Flaherty could platoon at second until Schoop is ready to return.The Orioles will have another dilemma in the bullpen once Troy Patton finishes serving his 25-game suspension for a failed drug test. Patton would give the Orioles three lefties in their bullpen, which may be more than they want to carry. The Orioles could try to move Patton, who has been serviceable out of the bullpen. However, there\xe2\x80\x99s probably not much value in soft-throwing lefties who are coming off their second failed drug test. The Orioles could try to move Brian Matusz or Zach Britton, but Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s slow start has probably hurt his value and Britton is\xc2\xa0pitching too well to let go of. If they decide to keep three lefties in their bullpen, they could try to find a trade partner for Josh Stinson. Stinson has started out the season slow, but at only twenty-six, may have enough trade value to warrant a move. If a move can\xe2\x80\x99t be made, Evan Meek and Ryan Webb still have options, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine either of them being sent down.Having too many quality players is a nice problem to have. It\xe2\x80\x99s a problem every team would love to have. Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter always seem to find a clever way of manipulating the roster, and it can be assured that they have some kind of plan in place. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
04/18/2014,"[(""Ryan Flaherty's place among the worst-hitting Orioles of ..."", "" One of the players on the Orioles offseason hype train was Ryan Flaherty. At Fanfest, when reporters spoke to J.J. Hardy, he said that he thought that Flaherty, given a full season, could hit 15-20 home runs. It looked like he was sure to be the regular second baseman and you could talk yourself into believing he'd do OK.    When he started the 2014 season with no hits in his first four games, reality crushed those dreams, and instead of wondering if he'd hit 20 home runs, instead you had to wonder whether he is the worst hitter ever to play for the Orioles, because that's the kind of hyperbole that you can engage in after four games. There's nothing else to talk about. He's no longer batting .000/.000/.000, but he's still scuffling at the plate after two weeks of baseball, and when you watch him, it still feels like he might be the worst. Flaherty has made 480 plate appearances as an Oriole. There are 166 players who have at least as many plate appearances in Orioles history. A top of the order hitter who plays every day will get around 700 plate appearances in a season, so he doesn't even have a full year's worth of plate appearances under his belt, but it's enough to figure that he is something close to what we've seen so far. This is particularly true since he's 27. As it turns out, Flaherty is not the worst-hitting Oriole ever, or even in recent memory. One quick and dirty way to compare players against both their contemporaries and players in the past is a statistic called OPS+, which takes a player's OPS (on-base percentage plus slugging) and adjusts for ballpark and league, then gives you a number. An average, OK number is 100. More is good. Less is not good.    Flaherty's career OPS+ on this date is 74, which means he's been 26% than league average during his career. This places him in 143rd place on the O's career list. The bottom four on the list are all pitchers, so he's really 143 out of 162. He has the same number of career triples as Jim Palmer, which is one.    Here's how Flaherty stacks up against the worst of the worst-hitting Orioles of all time.   Player Rank PA AVG OBP SLG OPS+   Ryan Flaherty 143 480 .217 .276 .365 74   Mark Belanger 153 6544 .227 .300 .280 68   Dave Duncan 154 640 .205 .258 .310 68   Geronimo Gil 155 871 .233 .279 .341 66   Kiko Garcia 156 1167 .232 .278 .317 66   Marv Breeding 157 1107 .248 .289 .313 65   Joe Ginsberg 158 585 .219 .301 .280 64   Jeff Reboulet 159 612 .217 .321 .283 61   Rene Gonzales 160 631 .221 .275 .281 58   Cesar Izturis 161 958 .240 .283 .292 56   Willy Miranda 162 1724 .219 .279 .266 53      You may have noticed a little trend here, in that these names are nearly all crappy, light-hitting infielders who spent a few years in a utility role with the Orioles. There are also a couple of crappy-hitting catchers. Among the players ranked 144-152 are Billy Ripken, Robert Andino, and Deivi Cruz. You see the pattern here. Flaherty fits right in with this lot. The only thing surprising about Flaherty is that we (by which I mostly mean I) ever tricked ourselves into believing him to be anything else. Hope is a funny thing. There are a couple of other surprising finds on this list. The fact that Izturis was not the worst-hitting Oriole of all time is the real shocker. I also never remembered that Reboulet was so terrible, probably solely because of that home run he hit off of Randy Johnson in the playoffs. Man, that was fantastic. In case you were curious about where some others among this season's Orioles rank, there are six players in addition to Flaherty with enough plate appearances to qualify. They are: Chris Davis (6th, 140 OPS+), Nick Markakis (39th, 113), Adam Jones (50th, 110), Matt Wieters (79th, 100), Manny Machado (80th, 100), and J.J. Hardy (90th, 96).    So, the next time someone tells you that Ryan Flaherty is the worst-hitting Oriole of all time, you can tell them that, no, he isn't the worst, just near the bottom of the list. If he heats up, he might even get to pass luminaries like Lenn Sakata and John Shelby.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
04/19/2014,"[('Clutch Hitting Powering the Baltimore Orioles', '\xc2\xa0Jonathan Schoop had his first 4-hit game Friday night in Boston. Mandatory Credit: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have found clutch hitting with runners in scoring position, even with two outs, to be the key ingredient for wins this year. Last night in Boston was a \xe2\x80\x9cgood Friday\xe2\x80\x9d for the Orioles as they had consistent hitting to power them to an 8-4 win over the Red Sox. The Birds pounded out 15 hits and were 6-for-17 with RISP (runners in scoring position).For this 2014 season so far, the Orioles are hitting .338 with RISP in the eight games that they have won (26-for-77). And this includes four of the eight games being low-scoring pitching affairs.Over the last several years, even with the powerful hitting teams the Orioles have had, they have so frequently had problems hitting with this situational batting category of scoring runs when the opportunity was present.In 2013, the Orioles were sixth in the AL with RISP at .266, though the numbers powering those stats often came in blowout wins. They were 11th in the AL with RISP and two out \xe2\x80\x93 batting at .231.Currently this season, the Baltimore Orioles are batting .295 with RISP, which is first in the American League. The Texas Rangers are next at .271 (with the Red Sox at .212 by comparison). The Orioles are also the best in the even more critical and difficult situation of RISP with two outs. The Birds are hitting .284 (the Sox .188, the Yanks .185). These numbers are not likely to be sustainable over a whole season, but excellence in this category will go a long way toward success at the highest level.Some Overall Statistical RankingsWhile looking at some stats for this piece, let me share a couple of others that are both encouraging and disappointing for the Baltimore Orioles.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are 3rd in the AL in overall batting average at .268 (behind the Yankees at .277 and Rangers at .273. But the Orioles are next to last in homers with a total of only nine (Would you have believed that a few weeks ago?). The Orioles had hoped to improve their on-base percentage, but that is still a struggle, as they are 11th in the AL at .313.On the pitching side of things, the Baltimore Orioles are slightly below the league average overall \xe2\x80\x93 tied for eighth in ERA at 3.93 for example. They are surprisingly fourth in walks given up, with only 44 (imagine where they\xe2\x80\x99d be without Ubaldo!), but are dead last by far in strikeouts with only 94. This final stat is not surprising for any O\xe2\x80\x99s fans who watch games and see the pitch counts rise with incessant foul balls. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t more of the Orioles pitchers have \xe2\x80\x9cput-away\xe2\x80\x9d pitches?Saturday in BostonThe Orioles have a 1:35 afternoon game today that will pit Felix Doubrant against Bud Norris.Doubrant pitched against the Orioles on April 3rd and won a 4-3 game over Wei-Yin Chen. But he gave up three runs on six hits along with four walks in 5.1 innings of work. His other two starts this season have not been great either. He only lasted 2.2 innings against Texas giving up six hits and five runs. Doubrant did have a quality start against the Yankees in his last outing, with seven hits and three runs in 6.2 innings. The 26-year-old is 25-20 for his career, with a 4.70 ERA.For the Orioles against Doubrant, it is a very mixed bag of results. Over his career against the O\xe2\x80\x99s he is 2-2 in 41 innings with a 4.61 ERA. Adam Jones, J.J.

I\'m trying to throw the ball over the plate and take the out because if you\'re giving it to me in a sac-bunt situation, I want the out every time,"" Norris said.Norris said he replied ""excuse me?"" Then Baltimore catcher Matt Wieters took over the conversation from there, standing squarely between Ross and the mound before both managers intervened by grabbing their own catcher and getting him out of there.""Wietie knew what was going on and he stood right in front of him, which was great.

Norris pitched seven shutout innings against Toronto in his last start, but ended up with a no decision when the bullpen couldn\'t hold on to a 2-1 lead.""He was good.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles will be nationally televised tonight as they play the third game of their four-game series with Boston Red Sox on ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday Night Baseball at 7 p.m. EST. The Orioles and Red Sox have split the first two games of the series, with the Orioles taking the first game 8-4 and the Sox taking the second 4-2.Big Start for JimenezTonight represents a great opportunity for Ubaldo Jimenez (0-3, 7.31) to right the ship and change the viewpoint of many fans who are beginning to question his acquisition. Jimenez has the second-worst WHIP in MLB, allowing more than two walks or hits per innings pitched, and has not gone more than six innings in any of his three starts for the Orioles.Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s failure to locate and get ahead of hitters have caused him to lean more heavily on his fastball later in the count. This year, Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s fastball velocity has dropped nearly 2 mph. Hitters have been able to catch up to Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s fastball and Jimenez has put himself in situations where hitters can predict he will throw it.To have success tonight, Jimenez must either throw his breaking ball more consistently for strikes, giving him another option when he gets down in the count, or throw strike one more often so he has the ability to use all of his pitches later.AL East Starts TightAs many predicted, the AL East has been the most hotly contested division in baseball throughout the first few weeks of the season. Every team in the AL East is within two games of each other. Most do not expect much more distance all the way until the season\xe2\x80\x99s end.The Orioles come into tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game at 8-8, one full game behind the division leading 10-8 New York Yankees. Boston is in last place in the division at 8-10.Every game against a division opponent is extremely important for the Orioles, especially because they will not only be competing with these teams for a possible division crown, but also for a potential Wild Card spot in the 2014 postseason.Bullpen Remains the KeyOrioles starters have pitched the second fewest innings in the major leagues, putting pressure on the bullpen. Given Ubaldo Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s lack of control in his first few starts and tendency to run a high pitch count, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen is called on again tonight to pitch three innings or more.So far this season, Orioles relievers have answered the call, sporting a 3.00 ERA in 51 innings pitched. Zach Britton, Evan Meek, and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day all have yet to give up a run this season. Tommy Hunter has converted four of five save opportunities and has shown the ability to get left-handers out, holding them to a .200 batting average.For the Orioles to remain in contention, the bullpen needs to continue to be a strength of this team.

Here is a quick preview of what is a very important game for the Orioles to win.The Birds will be facing a historically difficult character in Clay Buchholz. Though he is off to a rather poor start over his first three games of 2014, his lifelong record against the Baltimore Orioles is outstanding at 9-3 with a 3.40 ERA in 16 games. His MLB career record is 58-34 with a 3.64 ERA, and three of the four complete games in his career were against the O\xe2\x80\x99s.Not surprisingly, few Baltimore Orioles hitters have good career numbers against Buchholz. One who does in J.J. Hardy, though he went out of Sunday evening\xe2\x80\x99s game with a tweaked hamstring injury and will not likely be playing. Nelson Cruz is 4-for-10 with a homer. Adam Jones and Chris Davis have a pair of home runs off him, though their average against is .222 and .278.

After two rough starts to begin the 2014 season, Chen threw a good 6.1 innings against Tampa Bay while giving up only one run.Chen\xe2\x80\x99s numbers against the Red Sox over his eight starts are not very good at all. He is 2-3 with an ERA of 5.24 \xe2\x80\xa6 and Boston is batting .349 against him.The news just gets worse when looking at the individual matchups. Dustin Pedroia is 11-for-22 and Daniel Nava is 6-for-11.

Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsAnother game, another day where the Orioles blow an early lead, as the bats fall silent when they are needed, the bullpen falters and the defense makes another costly error.Game 19 \xe2\x80\x93 Baltimore Orioles 3 (9-10) Toronto Blue Jays 9 (11-9) FW: Steve Delabar (2-0, 4.91)L: Evan Meek (0-1, 3.72) \xe2\x80\x93 ERA was 0.00 going into the gameMVP: Brett Lawrie 1-3, 1 HR, 3 RBI, 1 R, 1 HBPThe GOOD: My mother always said if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything good to say, don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything at all so I guess I should find some good. There was some. Most notably, Steve Clevenger started his second straight game as Matt Wieters deals with a little forearm soreness. The Maryland native went 2-3 with a single, double and walk.Steve Lombardozzi had another good game offensively, going 3-4 and scoring once, despite only seeing 10 pitches. Nelson Cruz also had a good offensive game, hitting a three-run home run that gave the Orioles a lead in the 6th inning.Cruz also played well defensively, where he continues to not be a liability for the Orioles. In the pitching department, no one really looked great. TJ MacFarland fared pretty well in his first major league appearance of the season.The BAD: This game was all too predictable. First, when Steve Lombardozzi made an error in the 6th inning on a fairly routine ground ball, you knew it would cost the Orioles. Then, Miguel Gonzalez was cruising to that point, so the first sign of trouble immediately brought fear and apprehension. And even when the game was tied, you watch the Orioles load the bases with one out only to see an atrocious at-bat from Adam Jones. With the innings already put on the bullpen, you had a feeling this one might slip away. And that is part of the problem, because the Red Sox and Jays both have great bullpens.Lombardozzi\xe2\x80\x99s error goes down as the defensive miscue of the night.Hitting-wise, the Orioles were mainly only effective in the 6th inning. They also had their chances in the 7th inning, but stranded the bases loaded. Jonathan Schoop saw 9 pitches the entire game in four at-bats, and one was a three pitch strike out.What\xe2\x80\x99s NEXT: Luckily, the Orioles get right back at it on Wednesday night at 7:07 p.m. from Rogers Centre in Toronto, Canada. The Orioles will watch ace Chris Tillman (2-1, 1.71) take the mound, opposed by Dustin McGowan (1-2, 4.85). McGowan already has one great start against the Orioles under his belt, one in which he earned the win in a 2-0 victory. That game was the same in which Tillman earned his only loss, on a day where he allowed no earned runs. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Miguel Gonzalez to Battle R.A.

Mr. Rushin came up with the name \xe2\x80\x94 in honor of the late Yankee catcher Thurman Munson and the retired Red Sox right fielder Trot Nixon \xe2\x80\x94 in 2003, and he had to guess where the line ran: \xe2\x80\x9cnorth of New Haven but south of Hartford, running the breadth of central Connecticut.\xe2\x80\x9d  We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to guess anymore.  Fans may not list which team they favor on the census, but millions of them do make their preferences public on Facebook. Using aggregated data provided by the company, we were able to create an unprecedented look at the geography of baseball fandom, going down not only to the county level, as Facebook did in a nationwide map it released a few weeks ago, but also to ZIP codes. We can now clearly see that both Hartford and New Haven are in fact Yankee outposts. We can also determine the precise Chicago neighborhoods where White Sox jerseys stop being welcome and the central California town where the Dodgers cede fan favorite status to the Giants.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve created two features to help readers explore the data. First is an interactive map of the United States that allows you to explore not just the most popular team in your neighborhood but also a table of the top teams for any ZIP code in the country.  Second, in the spirit of Mr. Rushin\xe2\x80\x99s Munson-Nixon line, we\'ve generated 14 maps detailing baseball\xe2\x80\x99s biggest rivalries, highlighting the borders and offering suggested names for those lines.  The maps were created using estimates of team support based on how many Facebook users \xe2\x80\x9cliked\xe2\x80\x9d\teach team in a ZIP code. We applied an algorithm to smooth the data and fill in gaps where data was missing.  If you have alternate suggestions for border names, or have an idea or suggestion for a map not shown here, leave us a message in the comments or on Twitter or our Facebook page. We\'ll be updating this list regularly. Hopefully, this is just the start.       New York Yankees vs. Boston Red Sox Munson-Nixon Redux         We begin with a new take on the Munson-Nixon line, which differs from some previous interpretations in that it shows that Hartford has declared for the Yankees. It\xe2\x80\x99s still a border town, but it\'s a border town the way El Paso is \xe2\x80\x94 clearly on the Yankee side. One tidbit: Red Sox Nation seems to have conquered some new territory since 2012, when Ben Blatt tried to draw such a line. (Winning a World Series will do that.) We also encourage you to read our colleague John Branch\'s attempt at drawing the line in 2006, which is quite impressive and accurate given his shoe-leather means.      New York Mets vs. New York Yankees The We\xe2\x80\x99d-Draw-a-Line-If-We-Could Line         There\xe2\x80\x99s no other way to put it: The Yankees are the preferred team everywhere in New York City, and nearly everywhere in the U.S. over the Mets (in more than 98 percent of ZIP codes nationwide). One small Mets bright spot, if you want to call it that, is that in the area in Queens surrounding Citi Field, where the Mets play, Facebook users had the courtesy to prefer what some call the Evil Empire at a slightly reduced rate relative to its advantage elsewhere in New York.      Minnesota Twins vs. Milwaukee Brewers The Molitor Line         Minnesotans and Wisconsinites don\xe2\x80\x99t admit to having much in common, but in sports they have sometimes been forced to share. The most notable example is probably Paul Molitor, for whom our border is named. Molitor, a Hall of Famer from St. Paul whose name sounds conveniently similar to Maginot, played most of his career with the Brewers but finished it with the Twins. The teams\xe2\x80\x99 fans display a\xc2\xa0certain Midwestern stubbornness in keeping their allegiances roughly to state lines, with the exception of those WINOs (Wisconsinites in name only) who live just over the river from the Twin Cities. There\xe2\x80\x99s no real animosity between these two teams, given that they rarely play each other now. Still, don\xe2\x80\x99t put the peace at risk by bringing up Brett Favre.     Chicago Cubs vs. Chicago White Sox The Red Line Red Line         Helped by the charm of their field and by WGN\xe2\x80\x99s national broadcast reach, the Cubs have always been the better-loved of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s two teams. But the White Sox \xe2\x80\x94 unlike the Mets or the A\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 do have a patch of their own territory, on the city\xe2\x80\x99s South Side and into the southern suburbs. Interstate 290 (the Dwight D. Eisenhower Expressway) is a rough guide to the border: Know whether you\'re north or south of it before you put on your hat.     Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Los Angeles Angels The Reagan-Nixon Line         Among all the second-favorite teams \xe2\x80\x94 including the Mets, the A\xe2\x80\x99s and the White Sox \xe2\x80\x94 the Angels have done perhaps the best job of carving out a niche of fans. But despite the inroads made by the Angels, the Dodgers are still the clear favorite in Southern California. Their territory extends east to Big Bear Lake and west to Seal Beach. Also perhaps in the Dodgers\xe2\x80\x99 favor: The Ronald Reagan Library is in their territory, while the Angels have the Richard Nixon Library.     San Francisco Giants vs. Oakland Athletics Giant Country         Like the Mets, the Athletics are the less popular team in a two-team region \xe2\x80\x94 less popular everywhere in that region, based on the data from Facebook. Again, winning the World Series matters. The Giants have won two of the last four. The A\xe2\x80\x99s have won none of the last 24.     Oh, Ohio On to Columbus         Few states give their fans as many options as Ohio does. A fair-weather fan in the central part of the state could claim allegiance to several teams within a day\xe2\x80\x99s drive: not just the Reds and the Indians but the Cubs, the White Sox, the Pirates, the Tigers or even the Cardinals. But most Ohioans stay loyal to the home-state teams, and the border is right where you\'d guess. It runs straight though Columbus, Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s capital and largest city, in the middle of the state. One small exception to the Reds\xe2\x80\x99 and Indians\xe2\x80\x99 dominance: The longtime presence of the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 top minor league team in Toledo \xe2\x80\x94 the Mud Hens, the favorite team of Corporal Klinger from the television show ""M*A*S*H"" \xe2\x80\x94 has helped the Tigers claim some territory in northern Ohio.     St. Louis Cardinals vs. Kansas City Royals The Denkinger Line         The Show Me State has mostly thrown in with the Cardinals, who have been as good for the last two decades as the Royals have been bad. The line is well west of the halfway point between the two cities \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0Columbia, Mo. \xe2\x80\x94 and instead runs through Sedalia and Pittsburg. We can only guess what this map would have looked like in 1985, when a missed call by Umpire Don Denkinger helped the Royals win their last World Series, over the Cardinals. Unfortunately, there\xe2\x80\x99s no Facebook map for that: Mark Zuckerberg was not yet 2 years old.     New York Mets vs. Philadelphia Phillies The Sub-Hoagie Line         A common mistake in data analysis is to confuse correlation with causation; just because things are related doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean one caused the other. At the same time, last year\'s New York Times analysis of American dialects allows us to notice a striking pattern: Which N.L. East team you root for may be revealed by whether you call long sandwiches subs or hoagies. We don\'t know which causes which, but we do know they go together.* (Because of a mapping error, an earlier version of this map incorrectly characterized Trenton residents as Mets fans who eat hoagies. They appear to be Phillies fans or Yankees fans who eat hoagies.)     Houston Astros vs. Texas Rangers The Nolan Ryan Line         The state of Texas belongs to the Rangers, and why not? The team claims to represent the whole state, whereas the Astros belong merely to Houston, at least going by their name. It doesn\'t hurt that the Rangers have made the postseason three times in four years, while the Astros, who have been dreadful for several years, can\'t decide on a logo or even seemingly what league they\'re in. Many Houstonians also take pride in being a bit different from other Texans. Those other Texans apparently agree.     Washington Nationals vs. Baltimore Orioles The Line of Potomac Aggression         After the departure of the Senators in 1971, Washingtonians spent decades alternately lamenting their plight and treating the Orioles as their home team. That era is over. While the Orioles have held onto many Maryland suburbs, the Nats now dominate Washington and much of the Virginia suburbs. In parts of the Washington region, the Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t even the second-favorite team; the Yankees or the Red Sox are.     Chicago Cubs vs. St. Louis Cardinals The Downstate Line         Most states with a team have few areas that side with an out-of-state rival. Not so in Illinois, where half the state stands in open revolt. Bloomington, Champaign and Peoria appear to belong to the Cubs, but south of those cities, expect to see a lot of Cardinal red. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a longtime resident of this area, you may want to look up whether your ancestors voted for or against Abraham Lincoln in 1860.     Baltimore Orioles vs. Philadelphia Phillies The Morgan-Ripken Line         The South may have lost the Civil War, but the Orioles have done a better job of pushing north above the Mason-Dixon line than the Phillies have done expanding beyond their home state. Notably, the Orioles have won over Gettysburg, Pa. We\xe2\x80\x99ve named the Orioles-Phillies border for two of the protagonists in the 1983 World Series, which the Orioles won in five games.      Southern California Highway 1 Passport         Southern California is a group of small nation-states. San Luis Obispo, often considered a halfway point between the Giants and the Dodgers, is squarely Dodgers territory, according to Facebook users.  Further south, the Padres have problems. The baseball writer Joe Sheehan has noted their major challenges in raising revenue, given that they are hemmed in by the Pacific Ocean, the Mexican border, a desert and the Dodgers and the Angels. No one symbolizes the plight of the Padres, who have never won a World Series, quite as well as Adrian Gonzalez. Born in San Diego, he spent five years as a Padres slugger. But they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford him, and he now leads the Dodgers in home runs.             /*refer css*/       #g-refers {         overflow: hidden;         width: 100%;         margin: auto;         padding: 0;         color: #CCC;         border-top: 1px solid #dbdbdb;         margin-top: 60px;       }       #g-refers .g-refer-text {         margin: 20px 0 20px;         width: 100%;         clear: both;       }       .tinyportrait #g-refers .g-refer-text.g-clearfix {         width: 70%;         margin: 20px auto;       }       #g-refers a {         color: #333;       }       #g-refers a:hover {         text-decoration: none;         color: #333;       }       #g-refers a:hover p {         /*color: #fff !important;*/         text-decoration: underline;       }       #g-refers h2 {         font: 400 22px/28px ""Circular std"", CircularBlack, nyt-franklin, helvetica, arial;         margin-bottom: 6px;         color: #fff;       }       #g-refers h3 {         font: 200 16px/22px ""Circular std"", CircularBlack, nyt-franklin, helvetica, arial;         width: 100%;         margin-bottom: 10px;         color: #fff;       }       #g-refers h4 {       clear: both;       font: 200 14px/22px ""nyt-franklin"", arial;       text-transform: uppercase;       width: 100%;       color: #333;       font-weight: 300;       font-size: 17px;       letter-spacing: 1px;       }       #g-refers h5 {         font: normal 12px/12px nyt-franklin, Helvetica, Arial;         text-transform: uppercase;         margin: 8px 0;         font-weight: 700;       }       #g-refers h5 > span {       color: #555;       display: block;       margin-left: 0;       padding-left: 0;       font-weight: 300;       text-transform: none;       margin-top: 6px;       }       #g-refers p {         font: normal 14px/20px nyt-franklin, Helvetica, Arial;         max-width: 700px;       }       #g-refers .g-refer {         margin: 10px auto;         width: 100%;         /*max-width: 230px;*/       }       .viewport-small-10 #g-refers .g-refer {         float: left;         width: 43%;         margin: 10px 5% 0px 0;       }       .viewport-medium #g-refers .g-refer {       width: 22.5%;       margin: 20px 3% 0px 0;       }        .viewport-medium #g-refers .g-refer:last-child {         margin-right: 0;       }        #g-refers .g-refer p {         color: #333;         font-size: 17px;         font-family: \'nyt-franklin\', arial, sans-serif;         font-weight: 300;       }       #g-refers .g-credits {         margin-top: 20px;         max-width: 380px;       }       #g-refers .g-credits p {         margin: 4px auto;         font: normal 12px/16px nyt-franklin, Helvetica, Arial;         color: #666;       }       #g-refers > .g-icon {         display: block;         margin: 40px 0;       }       #g-refers > img {         width: 100%;         display: block;         margin: 40px auto 20px;       }        More From The Upshot \xc2\xbb How Birth Year Influences Political ViewsIs It Better to Rent or Buy?The Premier League Standings if Only Goals by English Players CountedWhich Team Do You Cheer For?

McFarland, it wasn't exactly surprising, what with the facts that Pearce had all of seven plate appearances to start the year, and basically filled the same role on the club as Nelson Cruz and Delmon Young were already covering.  In fact, to many folks it was surprising that Pearce made the club to start with, assuming that Pearce and Young were battling for the same slot, and that the last bench spot would go to a more versatile defender or potential pinch runner.    The Orioles' season will not hinge on the loss of Steve Pearce, of course.  You can call Pearce lots of things -- replacement level (0.5 career WAR in parts of eight seasons), AAAA fringe major-leaguer -- but you can't call him a difference maker.  Guys like Pearce can be nice to have around, but they're not hard to come by, either.  If a club needs a passable defender who can really only play corner outfield and first base, and specializes in hitting pitchers of a certain handedness, well, they're out there.  Some other club will snag Steve Pearce from the Orioles, and if the Orioles lose Delmon Young, they'll find another guy just like Pearce (or, hell, maybe bring Pearce back for a third separate Orioles tenure). But I like Steve Pearce.  This isn't really a rational thing -- Pearce has played in a whopping 65 games in his two Orioles stints, to a so-so line of .254/.276/.421 and 0.8 WAR.  He didn't have a ton of big moments, even on the magical 2012 team where it seemed like a different guy was making the magic happen every night.  His personality never took center stage, either.  But not taking center stage is kind of the tao of Steve (Pearce), isn't it? Go try to find anything exceptionally negative or positive about Steve Pearce online.  I dare you.  I'll wait here.  Didn't find much, did you?  I found this piece from Pearce's first callup about how he called his brother when he first broke into the majors, and this one where I learned that Pearce can beat J.J. Hardy at ping-pong, likes relaxing and playing golf, and would first rescue his phone if there was a fire and his family was already safe.    This is a guy who's kicked around five major league teams in seven separate stints, and you never hear him saying a word about it.  He's either the kind of guy who loves the game, and feels lucky to get paid well to play it a little bit (which I choose to believe), or he's smart enough to never let anyone outside the clubhouse know otherwise. There will always be work for a guy like Steve Pearce, even if most of that work is simply being on a roster and being available to fill in for an injured player or make a spot start against a left-handed pitcher.  And by all appearances, he probably loves that work, or doesn't even think of it as work, even if he's constantly being shipped around the country.  How can you not like a guy like that, at least a little bit?  Maybe this is the end of Steve Pearce, Baltimore Oriole.  Maybe he'll be back for a third spin.  I doubt I'll think much of Pearce in even a few years, but I won't think badly of him at all.  Fare thee well, Steve.  Land on your feet, even if it's in someone else's dugout.

(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Nathan Denette)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORETORONTO (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Dustin McGowan doesn\'t have the stamina he needs to get through nine innings right now, which is bad news for the Blue Jays and their overworked bullpen.Nelson Cruz hit two of Baltimore\'s season-high four home runs, Chris Davis and Matt Wieters also connected and the Orioles beat the Blue Jays 10-8 Wednesday night.McGowan, who allowed six runs and five hits in four-plus innings, said he started to tire in the fifth.""At 60 pitches I kind of seem to be falling backwards a little bit,"" he said. ""I feel good, my arm feels great. It\'s just sometimes it seems like the ball is not coming out quite right after 60-65 pitches.""The oft-injured McGowan began the season in the starting rotation this year for the first time since 2008. But after a spring training that was cut short by illness, he hasn\'t been able to build up his endurance, working into the sixth inning just once in four starts so far and putting a strain on Toronto\'s bullpen.""I\'ve got to find a way to get deep in the game and quit taxing the bullpen so much,"" McGowan said.Baltimore right-hander Chris Tillman did what McGowan could not, overcoming a six-run second inning to work into the sixth.Tillman, who won for the third time in four starts, allowed season-highs in hits, home runs and earned runs, but none of that bothered Baltimore manager Buck Showalter.""In a lot of ways, it might be one of his best outings this year,"" Showalter said.Cruz hit a solo homer off Dustin McGowan in the third and a grand slam off Todd Redmond (0-2) in the fifth, giving him six homers this season and 11 career multihomer games. The slam was his seventh.""Nelson is a great hitter,"" Wieters said. ""I always had trouble calling pitches against him so I\'m glad he\'s on our team. He\'s a huge addition to the middle of our lineup.""Davis hit a solo homer in the first, and Wieters added a solo drive off J.A. Happ in the seventh.""You have so much respect for that offense,"" Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. ""They keep coming at you.""Brett Lawrie hit a three-run homer for Toronto, his second home run in two games. Jose Reyes had a two-run shot and Ryan Goins hit a solo homer, his first this season.Shortstop J.J. Hardy (right hamstring) and Wieters (right forearm) both returned to Baltimore\'s lineup after sitting out the previous two games. Wieters hit a two-run double in Baltimore\'s six-run fifth and Hardy added a sacrifice fly.Ryan Webb got one out in the sixth, Brian Matusz allowed one run in two-thirds of an inning, and Darren O\'Day struck out Reyes to strand runners at first and second in the seventh.Tommy Hunter gave up three singles in the ninth as Toronto loaded the bases with one out, but Jonathan Diaz grounded into a game-ending double play to give Hunter his sixth save in seven chances.Cruz, who leads Baltimore with 21 RBIs, has driven in at least one run in six consecutive games, the longest streak by an Orioles player since Davis did it from Sept. 26 to Oct. 2, 2012. Doug DeCinces holds the Baltimore record, driving in at least one run in 11 straight games in a streak that started in September 1978 and ended the following April.Davis\' homer was his 18th against Toronto since the start of the 2012 season, the most by any opponent. Teammate Adam Jones is second with 14.Trailing 1-0, Toronto took the lead with a six-run second against Tillman. Lawrie hit a three-run homer and Reyes added a two-run drive, his first this season. Edwin Encarnacion capped the rally with an RBI single.NOTES: McGowan threw 70 pitches, 43 strikes. ... Toronto OF Jose Bautista drew two walks, increasing his major league-leading total to 27. Bautista has reached safely in all 21 games this season, the longest active streak in the majors. ... Baltimore RH Bud Norris (0-1) faces Toronto\'s Drew Hutchison (1-1) in Thursday\'s series finale.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But his time with the Senators was only one chapter of a long career in which he became a cherished figure in Cuban baseball.Marrero was one of Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s leading pitchers in both the amateur and professional ranks. After pitching for the Senators, he tutored many young players in Cuba, having remained there after Fidel Castro took power in 1959. In the late 1980s he was a part-time pitching coach for the Cuban League team in Granma Province, on the southeastern end of the island.

After he hurled several pitches, with the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Brady Anderson standing at the plate, officials finally called a halt to his unofficial comeback.

Lough was 3-for-4 with a walk, stole two bases (manufacturing a run with a steal of second and tag to third), had an outfield assist on a play at the plate, and made two excellent catches in the outfield.This is the style of play that was touted as Lough\xe2\x80\x99s strength when traded from the Royals for Danny Valencia. But a spring training incident with concussion-like symptoms has kept Lough down low \xe2\x80\xa6 until last night.But there were more heroes in the orange and black that made possible the very type of win we all expected would be a part of Baltimore Orioles baseball for the 2014 season. For the second consecutive evening, a Baltimore pitcher fell behind early in the game and battled back from a bad inning to hold the Jays under control until the bats came alive.Starter Bud Norris gave up a pair of 2nd-inning homers, including a two-run shot to Orioles killer Colby Rasmus, to give the Jays a 3-0 lead.\xc2\xa0 And as he did in his previous start, Toronto starter Drew Hutchinson showed great stuff and talent, mowing down the Baltimore Orioles with nine strikeouts in his six innings. But Jonathon Schoop took Hutchinson\xe2\x80\x99s first pitch of the fifth inning and made a souvenir out of it on a screamer that cleared the playing area as fast as could ever be seen. The Lough-manufactured run also scored that inning to cut the deficit to 3-2.But the Orioles would eat alive the Jays bullpen on this evening, scoring nine more runs on the way to an 11-4 win. All of the Birds lineup other than Ryan Flaherty contributed in a 14-hit attack. Both Adam Jones and Chris Davis had three RBIs, while Matt Wieters and Nelson Cruz added to their substantial early season totals with two each. The scoring was accomplished with the baseball beauty of closely-grouped hits that had the Orioles circling the bases.These past two wins are demonstrative of the compositional character of this team. On most nights, if the pitchers can hold the opponent reasonably under control, The O\xe2\x80\x99s offense is eventually going to outscore them.The Baltimore Orioles return home from this seven-game road trip that marks the completion of the first major section of the season. It was anticipated to be a tough stretch against all the AL East opponents and the Detroit Tigers. The Birds are 11-10 in the 22-game stretch, with a rainout to be made up later. Given the loss of Manny Machado, the relative absence of power hitting, and the poor starting pitching, the Orioles are actually in good shape to have the record they possess at this time. Baltimore has played 13 of their 21 games on the road.At home this weekend, the Orioles will play a three-game series against the Kansas City Royals. KC was beaten by the Indians last night 5-1, and they have opened the season with a 10-11 record. First baseman Eric Hosmer and short stop Alcides Escobar are off to great starts, hitting .301 and .300 respectively. DH Billy Butler is having the opposite experience, batting just .195 with only two doubles as all of his extra base hits in 77 at bats.The series will also feature the return of former Oriole Danny Valencia, who is 3-for-11 with a homer in four games so far this year.The Baltimore Orioles will be facing a very good 22-year-old pitcher named Yorlando Ventura. This will be only his seventh career start and game, with a current ERA of 3.05 in 32 innings. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s intimidated! This will be his fourth start this season. After giving up only one run in 13 combined innings against the Rays and Texans, the Twins got to him in his last outing for four runs in four innings.The Orioles will counter with Ubaldo Jimenez. So yes, the game is a battle between Yorlando and Ubaldo. I wonder if Dominicans make fun of American names in baseball blogs down there!Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s $50 million man has not had a good experience so far this season. He is yet to have a good game in his previous four starts, and he comes into this game with a record of 0-3 and ERA of 6.75.\xc2\xa0 He clearly does not like cold weather, and sadly the forecast is for 56 degrees at game time with a 70% chance of rain.Jimenez is 4-2 over nine career starts against the Royals. Hosmer has good numbers against him, being 8-for-22 with a pair of homers. Butler is 6-for-22 with a homer.

David Lough relayed the ball to J.J. Hardy, who threw Encarnacion out at the plate (with Matt Wieters applying then tag). Or maybe it was Bud Norris settling down after a rough second inning, which included a solo homer by Dioneer Navarro and a two-run homer by Colby Rasmus. However either way the Birds were able to settle things down after a rough second inning, and came on late to claim a key AL East division victory.The second inning was similar to Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s second inning in that Toronto got ahead and seemingly appeared ready to bury the Orioles. Norris\xe2\x80\x99 pitches started to miss, although he quickly regained his composure. Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 6 IP, 5 H, 3 R, 1 BB, 4 K. Norris also appeared to experience some discomfort in his hamstring in the fourth inning, however he was able to stay in the game. However one key to this win for the O\xe2\x80\x99s was that Norris was able to adjust and right himself, all of course while knowing that with the potent bats up and down the lineup he was never out of the game. Jonathan Schoop began the comeback in the fifth with a solo homer to left that hopped out of the park, which was followed later in the inning by a Chris Davis RBI-single.So with that the Baltimore Orioles found themselves down by only one, and in the process they picked up their bats where they had left off the night before. Chris Davis gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s the lead for good in the top of the seventh with his two-RBI single in the top of the seventh. However the fact is that in a park such as Rogers Centre, a one-run lead isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily safe. (For the record, a one-run lead is NEVER safe in ANY park.) So in the spirit of insurance Adam Jones and Matt Wieters each added RBI-singles, and the Orioles led 7-3 after seven.However the Baltimore Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t done \xe2\x80\x93 yet. With the bases loaded in the top of the eighth once again, Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x98s two-RBI single put nine runs on the board for the Birds. Adam Jones would add a second two-RBI single in the inning, and Toronto would tack one on in the last of the eighth to run the final score to 11-4. However as great as the offense was, make no mistake about the fact that Bud Norris was the partial reason that the O\xe2\x80\x99s won this game.Courtesy of Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY SportsSimilar to Chris Tillman the night before, Norris didn\xe2\x80\x99t panic following an inning in which he struggled. And ultimately he ended up tossing a quality start for the Birds, something that they sorely needed. Many other pitchers would have hit the panic button and ended up making things worse, and furthermore many other managers would have probably yanked Norris before he had a shot at righting himself.Obviously Oriole bats came alive in the last two games of the series, which stands in a complimentary light to the starting pitcher struggling and then later finding himself. The O\xe2\x80\x99s seemed destined to be run out of the park last night, but they strung together good at-bats to come back and take the lead late in the two games they won in Toronto. The one that crops up into my mind right away is Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 aforementioned RBI-single, in which he placed the ball right between the Toronto infielders who were playing a shift. If the Birds can start hitting against the shift, they\xe2\x80\x99ll really start becoming a potent team.The Orioles now stand at 11-10, and in second place in the AL East (leap-frogging Toronto in the standings). They\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through perhaps the toughest part of their schedule, in which they played 19 of their first 21 games in the division. This is not to say that playing teams such as Kansas City and Pittsburgh is going to be easy, but\xe2\x80\xa6it could in theory be a bit\xc2\xa0easier\xc2\xa0 than playing Boston, NY, et al, on a nightly basis. The Baltimore Orioles now return home tonight to open up a five-game homestand.

The first baseman grabbed at his side after fouling a pitch back in an at-bat in the third inning. He finished the at-bat, a lineout to center, and played another inning in the field, before being lifted from the game, with Ryan Flaherty shifting to first base in his place.    Oblique strains are never good news. It's probably premature to assume he's headed to the disabled list immediately, but that seems to be the standard procedure for that kind of injury.

Infielders who are on the 40-man but not the active roster are Jemile Weeks, David Adams, and Michael Almanzar. Rule 5 pick Almanzar is already on the disabled list himself, though he is working his way back.

The Orioles went eight straight innings without scoring before facing Duffy, who had pitched 8 1-3 scoreless innings on the season. After Duffy (1-1) hit Jonathan Schoop to begin the 10th, the left-hander threw wildly to second base after fielding a bunt by David Lough. Jemile Weeks followed with another bunt, and on this one Duffy\xe2\x80\x99s throw went high and wide to first, loading the bases. Louis Coleman replaced Duffy and struck out Nelson Cruz before Markakis hit an opposite-field liner that landed inside the left-field foul line. Zach Britton (3-0), the sixth Baltimore pitcher, struck out Jarrod Dyson with two outs and a runner on second in the top of the 10th. Kansas City fell to 0-12 when failing to score at least four runs. The Royals \xe2\x80\x94 who stranded 11 and went 3 for 11 with runners in scoring position \xe2\x80\x94 are 11-0 when scoring four or more runs. The Orioles played without slugger Chris Davis, who left Friday night\xe2\x80\x99s game with a strained left oblique. Although Davis expects to avoid the disabled list, Baltimore recalled Weeks from Triple-A Norfolk to provide an extra bat while last year\xe2\x80\x99s major league home run leader is sidelined. Davis was replaced at first base by Markakis, who moved from his customary spot in right field to a position he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t played since 2011. Jeremy Guthrie started for Kansas City and gave up two runs before getting two outs, and then blanked his former team over the next six innings before leaving with the game tied. The right-hander finished up by getting David Lough to hit into a double play with runners on the corners and one out in the seventh. Baltimore starter Wei-Yin Chen allowed two runs, nine hits and two walks over a season-high seven innings. The left-hander ended his outing with his sixth strikeout, against Alex Gordon with two on and two outs. The Orioles took a 2-0 lead in the first. Weeks hit a leadoff single in his first at-bat with Baltimore, Cruz walked and Markakis delivered an RBI single before Adam Jones drove in a run by hitting into a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice. The Royals used doubles by Alcides Escobar and Eric Hosmer to get a run in the third. Chen avoided further damage by retiring Gordon on a grounder with the bases loaded and two outs. After Weeks tripled with two outs in the fifth and Cruz looked at a third strike, Kansas City pulled even in the sixth. Gordon singled and Danny Valencia beat out a chopper to third before Justin Maxwell blooped a two-out RBI single to center. NOTES: Orioles C Matt Wieters went hitless after getting at least two hits in four straight games. \xe2\x80\xa6 Miguel Gonzalez will pitch for the Orioles in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s series finale against James Shields, who\xe2\x80\x99s 9-7 in 24 career starts against Baltimore. \xe2\x80\xa6 Guthrie is 2-0 with a 1.89 ERA in three career starts against the Orioles.

Weeks will trade places from AAA Norfolk with T.J. McFarland, who pitched three innings last evening. This brings the pitching staff back to the more normal total of 12 arms rather than 13.For one, I certainly applaud this move, having been a long-term skeptic of Ryan Flaherty. Without doubt, Flaherty gives the Orioles more options as a plus-defender in varied positions, along with more occasional power. But Weeks has, in my view, the greater upside potential for much higher offensive production, especially with average, on base percentage, and speed.Flaherty has struggled terribly to produce much offense for the Orioles thus far in 2014 (currently hitting .183, and .216 career), whereas Weeks has been ripping the ball quite well at Norfolk, hitting .296, and with 16 walks putting up an OBP of .451.

The right-hander gave up only an infield hit in the first five innings and improved to 10-7 lifetime against Baltimore, including 7-2 at Camden Yards.Shields was more impressed with Infante\'s performance, which included a fine defensive play at second base against Baltimore leadoff hitter Jemile Weeks.""Omar, definitely the player of the game,"" Shields said. ""It all started with that first play he made barehanded. He had a great day today. Definitely carried our team.""Infante hit a run-scoring groundout in the first inning, a sacrifice fly in the third, a two-run double in the fifth and a two-run shot in the seventh. He entered with one home run and 11 RBIs in 21 games.""It was a great day for me,"" Infante said. ""I\'m happy because that has not happened too many times for a player. It was a great day for the team. I\'ve been working hard in the cage. The last couple of days I hit a lot of fly balls. I don\'t like that; I want to drive the ball.""The last time Infante had six RBIs was last Sept. 13 with the Tigers against Kansas City. The starter for the Royals that day was .... James Shields.""I\'m glad he\'s on my team now,"" Shields said.Nori Aoki scored three runs for the Royals, who took two of three from Baltimore to conclude a 3-4 road trip that began in Cleveland. Kansas City is 12-0 when scoring at least four runs and 0-12 when scoring three runs or fewer.""I take it we need to score four runs. We\'re trying to do it more,"" manager Ned Yost said. ""It\'s just a testament to how good our pitching is, how good our bullpen is. How good our starting pitchers are, how consistent they are that we could have that kind of record.""Nelson Cruz hit his seventh homer for the Orioles, who finished with five hits. Before the game, Baltimore put slugger Chris Davis on the 15-day disabled list with a left oblique strain.Miguel Gonzalez (1-2) gave up four runs, three earned, and six hits in six innings.""Deserved a better fate,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.The Orioles quickly got a hint of what kind of day it was going to be when Aoki, leading off the first, hit a fly to center that popped out Adam Jones\' glove for a three-base error. Infante followed with a grounder to shortstop that put the Royals ahead for good.""Missed it,"" Jones acknowledged.It wasn\'t the Orioles\' only mistake.""We made a couple of good decisions with pitchouts (but) we weren\'t able to execute that,"" Showalter said. ""Those are two free outs. Then obviously, Adam\'s one of the best center fielders in the game. So I\'m not going to lament that at all. He\'s been a rock for us out there. You spot them, give them those type of things that they don\'t earn, with Shields on the mound, that\'s not a good combination.""Baltimore fell to 0-7 in games it makes an error. The Orioles are 12-5 without committing an error.After Jarrod Dyson singled and scored in the third, singles by Alcides Escobar and Aoki preceded Infante\'s double in the fifth.Baltimore closed to 4-2 in the sixth when Jemile Weeks singled and Cruz homered to center, but Kansas City\'s four-run seventh against reliever Evan Meek turned the game into a blowout. After Infante connected, Alex Gordon doubled in two runs for an 8-2 lead.""The flood gates opened,"" Yost said. ""That broke the game open at that point.""Mike Moustakas doubled in a run off Ryan Webb in the ninth, and the Orioles scored in the bottom half on a wild pitch.NOTES: Orioles LF David Lough made a fine diving catch in the eighth inning to rob Dyson of a hit. ...

04/28/2014,"[('Orioles: Chris Davis and Oblique Injuries in Baseball', 'With Chris Davis of the Baltimore Orioles being on the DL for an oblique injury, it raises the question as to why this has become such a common malady in major league baseball.Many of us who have been followers of the great American pastime wonder why it is that we never heard about this injury before recent years. Logic says that it cannot be an entirely new malady that had never happened much before, and indeed it is not \xe2\x80\xa6 though it is certainly more prevalent in the modern game.In the past it would have gone under the name of a rib cage injury or an abdominal strain. Now, with the advanced technology of magnetic resonance imaging, the more specific terminology of \xe2\x80\x9coblique\xe2\x80\x9d has entered the mainstream reporting about this core injury.Relative to other sports, baseball calls for a tremendous amount of rotational strain of the twisting and turning of the torso. Add to this the greater strength training of the modern athlete that increases these strains and forces, and at some point the muscle tissue is unable to absorb the activity.As this injury seemed to grab the headlines so frequently in recent years, dropping more than a few famous players on the DL for extended times, baseball trainers and therapists began to research the issue more specifically. In 2011, the L.A. Dodgers trainer did an extensive 20-year study of baseball injuries. He did discover that there was some general increase in frequency over that time. But a more interesting statistic to rise from his research was that a full one-third of these oblique injuries happen in the month of April, seeming to suggest that many players are not ready at the front of the season for the stresses and strains of the regular season.As with any kind of strain, there are degrees of breakdown and severity of condition. In any event, it really, really hurts! Some players who have had a bad case of oblique strains talk about it hurts to even absorb the pounding of walking, and having to sneeze is about the single most painful experience in life.The injury is notoriously frustrating to rehab and return from inactivity \xe2\x80\x93 without a setback or worse. And the rehab portion of it simply involves a lot of rest \xe2\x80\x93 frustrating for the typical male who wants to \xe2\x80\x9cdo something to fix this problem.\xe2\x80\x9dAll the talk sounds like Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 particular case in on the less severe end of the spectrum. But what I believe can be read into Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s remarks about not actually expecting Davis back and playing two weeks from today is simply that no oblique injury actually heals up that fast.Davis says he is historically a quick healer. I guess this is a little bit like a quick sleeper \xe2\x80\x93 you know, when Buck says at the end of an evening post-game interview about the day game to follow: \xe2\x80\x9csleep fast.\xe2\x80\x9dIn any event, we are going to see some maneuvering and different players in different places. Nick Markakis looks pretty good at first base. That seems like a sufficient solution to me. Manny Machado might be back a few days earlier than most recently believed \xe2\x80\x93 so there is some good news.The best day however will be the one where we look around the infield and see Chris Davis, Jonathon Schoop, J.J. Hardy, and Manny Machado. That is the infield we\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for, but may have to wait a bit longer to see.

An \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d grade was worth four, a \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d three, down the line to zero points for an \xe2\x80\x9cF\xe2\x80\x9d grade.The Orioles team of Thorne and Palmer earned 629 \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d votes, 532 \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d votes, 179 \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d votes, 49 \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d votes, and 48 \xe2\x80\x9cF\xe2\x80\x9d votes for a \xe2\x80\x9cGPA\xe2\x80\x9d of 3.14. var adSkipCounter = 0; Given that most voters would only be familiar with their own local broadcasts, it reflects an overwhelming positivity towards the MASN booth among Orioles fans.Thorne, a former attorney and a six-year veteran in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 booth, has announced baseball for nearly three decades. He\xe2\x80\x99s also well-known among hockey fans for his work on ESPN when the network still carried the sport, and he\xe2\x80\x99s well respected by fans inside and out of the industry.And even if Palmer wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the impressive analyst he is, it\xe2\x80\x99d be difficult for Orioles fans to grade him badly. The Hall of Fame pitcher earned three Cy Young awards and made five All-Star teams in his 19-year career.Outside of Thorne and Palmer, the top three has a decidedly local flavor. Former Orioles voice Jon Miller, whose ouster in 1996 as the team\xe2\x80\x99s broadcaster ended a 13-year stint in the city and elicited protests at Camden Yards, came in first in his latest role in San Francisco.Miller signed on to call games in his hometown just after leaving the Orioles, and along with fellow play-by-play men Duane Kuiper and Dave Flemming, and analyst Mike Krukow, the former ESPN Sunday Night Baseball announcer earned the top spot with a \xe2\x80\x9cGPA\xe2\x80\x9d of 3.46.Legendary Los Angeles Dodgers television voice Vin Scully, as well as his substitutes Charley Steiner and Orel Hershiser, came in second with a 3.41 GPA.Thorne and Palmer\xe2\x80\x99s MASN colleagues, Bob Carpenter and F.P. Santangelo, didn\xe2\x80\x99t fare as well in the rankings. The Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 announce team had the second-highest number of \xe2\x80\x9cF\xe2\x80\x9d votes, only behind the wholly unlovable Hawk Harrelson in Chicago, en route to a 1.79 GPA and 27th place.But let\xe2\x80\x99s not dwell on the negative.

Steinbrenner Field. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsAs the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching continues to struggle, it is becoming more and more evident that something will have to change. Ranking 12th in the AL in ERA and 11th in total runs allowed is not a characteristic of a playoff team. Ubaldo Jimenez (0-4, 6.59), Miguel Gonzalez (1-2, 5.19) and Bud Norris (1-2, 4.44) have all failed to pitch deep and effectively into games and it has wreaked havoc on the bullpen, which also has been letting the team down of late.Evan Meek (0-1, 6.75), Josh Stinson (0-0, 7.25), Brian Matusz (1-1, 5.40), and Ryan Webb (0-0, 5.00) have exacerbated the issues created by the rotation, resulting in a domino-effect that has overworked the bullpen just one month into the season. Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s loss to the Kansas City Royals exemplified the pitching staff\xe2\x80\x99s struggles thus far into the season.How will the Orioles fix this problem? It is highly likely that two internal solutions to this problem could help alleviate the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching woes. Norfolk Tides pitchers Suk-min Yoon and Kevin Gausman both are seen to be potential rotation options, but equally important, they are also bullpen options.Yoon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have eye-popping numbers in his four starts in the Triple-A. Sporting an 0-3 record with a 6.75 ERA, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 most recent major international signing out of Japan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be an obvious choice. However, after a very rough introduction to American baseball in his first two starts (6.2 IP, 12 ER), Yoon has begun to settle in a bit. Yoon\xe2\x80\x99s last two starts saw him give up just 1 ER in 10.2 IP. Though, he allowed 16 hits and 2 BBs, 1 ER in 10.2 IP is very notable and hopefully will play into a boost in confidence and a sense of belonging in American baseball. He was signed to be a major leaguer, and that is still the intention. He seems more likely to see time in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen before any rotation spot is considered. Like Yoon, Gausman has also bounced back from a few rough starts.Last year, Gausman established himself as a useful member of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen after struggling in the rotation. Despite a strong Spring Training (11 IP, 2.45), the 23-year-old was optioned to Triple-A to continue his development, and possibly to save his arm for later in the season. His sparkling first start of the season (4.2 IP, 0 ER, 6 SO) was followed by two disappointing starts (combined 7 IP, 6 ER). Thankfully, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t take Gausman long to bounce back, as he allowed no earned runs in a \xc2\xa0combined 9.2 IP in his last two starts. He will undoubtedly crack the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 25-man roster eventually in 2014, and it will be much earlier than September. His talent, and noted success out of the bullpen, make him an extremely viable solution to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching problems.One other solution is giving Zach Britton (3-0, 1.17) a shot at the rotation. That seems to be a possibility, but it would remove one of the few working parts from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 struggling bullpen. If Britton failed to be an effective starter, as he has in his previous rotation stints, it could potentially harm both the rotation and the bullpen. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mess with a good thing regarding Britton.With Chris Davis now on the 15-day DL and J.J. Hardy battling nagging injuries, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense may potentially face even greater challenges in the coming weeks, even with Manny Machado returning from his knee injury. This means that their pitchers will have even less run support to work with, therefore demanding the best possible staff. If manager Buck Showalter and executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette feel the need to make a significant change in the next few weeks, it will likely involve Yoon or Gausman. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles: Is Good Pitching Helping or Ruining the Game of ...', 'Waiting out a rain delay. Mandatory Credit: David Richard-USA TODAY SportsWithout doubt there is a trend over the past 15 years in MLB to see pitching becoming more dominant. Is this good or bad for the game of baseball?Here on this off day for the Baltimore Orioles, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pondering this question. Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about it for a while \xe2\x80\xa6 but a rainy day without an O\xe2\x80\x99s game gives me more reason for such contemplations.Also triggering this brain storm activity (storm / rain \xe2\x80\x93 see what I did there?) is the performance of James Shields against the Orioles yesterday. He was excellent, even factoring in the two-run homer of Nelson Cruz. Shields only gave up three hits in seven innings.But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only one to pitch that well yesterday. Here comes an amazing statistic \xe2\x80\xa6 and it is what got me writing this article. Yesterday (Sunday) was the first time in the history of MLB that, on the same day, 10 starters went seven innings or more and gave up three hits or less. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pause while that sinks in!As I said above, pitching has become more dominant in the past 15 years. It certainly feels that way. So, to check it out, I did some research and came up with this following chart of the yearly statistics in all of MLB \xe2\x80\x93 tracking batting averages and ERAs\xe2\x80\xa6YearMLB BAMLB ERA2014.2483.782013.2533.862012.2554.012011.2553.942010.2574.072009.2624.312008.2644.322007.2684.462006.2694.522005.2644.282004.2664.462003.2644.392002.2614.272001.2644.412000.2704.76\xc2\xa0Over 15 years, the batting average is now roughly about 20 points lower, with the ERA coming down now also about .75 or so.So is this good for the game? That is probably an answer that brings a response much salted with personal tastes and opinion.I will answer for myself that it is not good. And as a former pitcher, I surprise myself a bit. But honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we want to see baseball turn into the bat and ball scoring version of soccer. In my local community I am somewhat renowned for my distaste of that sport that disallows the use of two limbs, except for one player. I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually hate it nearly as much as my reputation suggests, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the low-scoring nature of that sport will allow it to ever grow to popularity in the USA that it has in other parts of the world.Here are a couple of things that I do \xe2\x80\x9cget\xe2\x80\x9d about soccer that fuels fans of that sport in their struggle to understand why anyone would like baseball. The action is continuous, even if it is a lot of passing it around far from the goal. And there is a set time for the game with few breaks \xe2\x80\x93 like between innings. And so, soccer fans think of baseball as interminable and too much suspended action between a pitcher and batter, while the rest of the players (and the fans) are waiting and waiting for something to happen.As a baseball purist, I enjoy that suspension \xe2\x80\x93 which to the observant eye is filled with action and gamesmanship of pitch selections and defensive posturing. But here\xe2\x80\x99s the point \xe2\x80\x93 low-scoring pitching battles add to the sort of (growing?) skeptical view of the sport as pictured immediately above.There was a time in the history of baseball about 45 years ago where it reached a point that something had to be done to diminish the pitching dominance of the sport. In the late 60s, the mound was lowered in order to induce more offence. It did, and the sport benefitted.Is the time coming when another modification is needed? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe.Perhaps we should also therefore ponder why this is happening \xe2\x80\xa6 what has contributed to the chart above?The answer is likely rather more complex than the two items I am going to suggest, but here goes\xe2\x80\xa61.\xc2\xa0 In the highly competitive ebb and flow of baseball at the highest level, managers and coaches have rightly understood that good pitching will far more often stop good hitting than the other way around. Therefore, a premium has been put upon the technical development of pitchers that is beyond anything known in the sport until recent years. Again, some may argue that this is a good thing.2.\xc2\xa0 The development of advanced sabermetrics and computer analyses of EVERYTHING has allowed for strategic implementation of defensive shifts to the extent that this is having a statistical effect upon the game. The Baltimore Orioles are probably one of the best, if not the very best, at utilizing this resource. Again, some may argue that this is a good thing.I would rather see the game returned to the offensive production level of 15 years ago. I think that is a more interesting game that is also more compelling to the masses of the people. So will the pendulum naturally swing back in that direction at some point? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I will say that I do not currently see anything that would generate a trend in that direction.My personal bias will come out in this final remark: If indeed the defensive shifts have contributed to this change that MLB will deem as negative, a step that could be taken would be to disallow over-shifts. I personally hate them. Why punish a player who is good enough to hit consistently to a spot not traditionally defensed? \xc2\xa0By illustration, is it really better for the game of baseball to over-shift on a guy like Chris Davis and turn him into an opposite-field slap hitter instead? The idea is not actually that far \xe2\x80\x9cout there.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 After all, the NBA disallows certain defenses for the good of that sport.So, anyhow \xe2\x80\xa6 this is a topic that perhaps some of you would have interest in commenting upon, and I\xe2\x80\x99d welcome that \xe2\x80\xa6 as it is a matter of opinion for sure. After all, it looks like we will have time for conversations over the coming days. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure when we are ever going to see baseball again in Baltimore. Between tonight (Monday) and Thursday morning, they are calling for up to five inches of rain in Maryland. The Orioles are off tonight and Thursday, with games on Tuesday and Wednesday \xe2\x80\x93 the peak periods of precipitation.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are activating Manny Machado today, taking the roster spot of Chris Davis, even as they watch the rain wash away all immediate hopes of actually playing the game of baseball anytime soon.Manny Machado certainly appears to be plenty ready to resume full baseball activity by pounding out eight hits in 12 appearances for the Frederick Keys over the weekend. Even though we need to rightly remind ourselves that this is level \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d baseball, it is still impressive and worthy of encouragement.There are other pending roster moves for the Orioles. With a record of 12-12, the next game will be #25 on the season which takes Troy Patton off the restricted list. So, either tonight, or tomorrow, or Thursday, or sometime in the next couple weeks when the rain finally stops, he will presumably be back on the 25-man roster. Some relief pitcher will have to come off. My guess is that it would be Evan Meek \xe2\x80\xa6 or possibly Josh Stinson? Neither has looked especially effective lately.Beyond that, there is the possibly of the Baltimore Orioles re-signing Steve Pearce if he makes it successfully through the waiver process, which ends today I do believe. Who would he replace? I would suppose it would be Jemile Weeks, though I would send down Ryan Flaherty and see if someone at AAA can get his swing to stop resembling a golf blast out of a deep sand trap. There is nothing level about it these days; he looks like he is spelling the letter \xe2\x80\x9cU\xe2\x80\x9d with his swing.Even as I look out the window here mid afternoon on Tuesday and see a total deluge taking place, there is still a scheduled game for this evening. It is the first of two with Pittsburgh \xe2\x80\x93 the only trip to Baltimore for the Pirates this season. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if I can re-arrange life in such a way as to see a doubleheader in Baltimore on Thursday?The Pirates are not off to a very good start on the season. Their record is 10-16 and the offense ranks next to last in the NL at .221, while the team pitching ERA of 3.65 places them 10th in the NL. By contrast, the Baltimore Orioles are 4th in the AL in hitting at .265 and 12th in pitching at 4.49.Center fielder Andrew McCutchen is hitting .286, while second baseman Neil Walker has six homers while batting just .235. Those are the shining star statistics at this moment!The pitching matchup is scheduled to be 6\xe2\x80\x995\xe2\x80\x9d Charlie Morton (0-3) versus 6\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Tillman (3-1).Morton has pitched once in his career against the Orioles on June 20, 2011 in Pittsburgh. It was not a happy experience for the big right-hander. He gave up six earned runs on eight hits, as just about everyone in the lineup got a single or double \xe2\x80\x93 including Jake Arrieta, the winning pitcher, who singled in the top of the first before even getting to throw a pitch.This will be start #6 for Morton, who has a current ERA of 4.35 over 31 innings. Actually, three of his five games have been quality starts. His most recent outing was against the Reds where he allowed three runs on four hits over six innings; however he also gave up five walks.Chris Tillman will likewise be making his sixth start of the season for the Baltimore Orioles.

Vote Orange. MLB\'s All-Star voting is\xc2\xa0live, and you can vote for Matt Wieters, Nelson Cruz and a bunch of other Orioles who probably don\'t deserve to make the team based on what they\'ve done so far in 2014.  Watch the horrible rain-delay programming on MASN and drink until you can convince yourself that it\'s baseball. Hunt down Nick Markakis and pie him in the face so that he\'ll get over himself and participate in the team\'s fun activities on the rare occasions when he\'s responsible for a game-winning hit. Call Jim Palmer and ask him about that one time he gave up a grand slam. Report back on whether you can hear an aneurysm occur over a phone line. Make a full line of Twins voodoo dolls in preparation for the Orioles\' next series. \xc2\xa0Please note that it\'s never OK to wish pain and injury on other players, so you should just make them miss a few games with comical ailments like explosive diarrhea or lupus.

Mandatory Credit: Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY SportsNow that the 2014 season for the Baltimore Orioles has gone through the month of April, what are the highlights so far, as well as the biggest disappointments?Actually, there may be one more game in April this evening (Wednesday 4/30), though the weather situation is not promising. The plan is for the Orioles to play the Pirates in the first of two games, with yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game now being postponed to Thursday. A preview of today\xe2\x80\x99s game \xe2\x80\x93 posted yesterday \xe2\x80\x93 can be found HERE. After beginning the season with a 6-3 record, Pittsburgh has gone 4-13 since.But in thinking back over the first month, let\xe2\x80\x99s identify both five highlights and five disappointments \xe2\x80\xa6Baltimore Orioles April HighlightsMatt Wieters resurgence \xe2\x80\x93 I believe this is the story of the year so far with the Orioles. Honestly, I did not see this coming. I had given up on Wieters as anything more than an average-hitting catcher with nice occasional power and great defensive skills. Currently Matt is hitting .338 with four homers and 15 RBIs. And he is doing it from both sides of the plate.Nelson Cruz proves to be a bargain so far \xe2\x80\x93 There is no doubt that Cruz is a great hitter, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone foresaw this month of April that he has enjoyed. His seven home runs and 25 RBIs would put him on pace for 47 homers and 169 runs knocked in! It was an offseason goal for the Orioles to solidify and enhance the DH spot in the order. Right now the Orioles are about 90-100 points higher at DH than the average in 2013.Zach Britton\xe2\x80\x99s dominance \xe2\x80\x93 That Zach Britton is often unhittable is not surprising after seeing him in spring training, but it would not have been assumed prior to that. These 95 mph sinkers are just about the nastiest looking pitches in baseball right now. Britton has a 1.17 ERA in 10 games with 15.1 innings pitched. Some folks are clamoring for him to become a starter. But at his current pace he will appear in 67-68 games instead of 30 or so as a starter. He is on pace to throw 103 innings \xe2\x80\x93 these innings being at more critical times of games than the 180 approximate total innings he would accumulate if made into a starter.Chris Tillman as staff ace \xe2\x80\x93 Even though Tillman had his worst outing in three years in his last performance, the first four starts of the season were stellar. It is clear that Tillman is the best pitcher on the staff and that his prior year-and-a-half performance was no flash in the pan. He is a legit top of the rotation sort of starter.Jonathan Schoop is not overwhelmed \xe2\x80\x93 This too is another area of pleasant surprise for me. Schoop did not drill minor league pitching last year, and his Arizona Fall League performance was very mediocre. But to be fair, he had some injury issues to overcome, and this very, very young man filled out his frame in impressive fashion. Though Schoop has had to often play out of position this season, and though he is clearly seen to be often learning on the job, the guy is certainly not in over his head whatsoever. His swing is a thing of beauty, and when he squares up a ball, it jumps off his bat. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason to not keep him in Baltimore, and that is something I would not have written only five to six weeks ago.Baltimore Orioles April DisappointmentsUbaldo Jimenez \xe2\x80\x93 So far, Jimenez has shown why the Orioles (and many other teams) are very slow to make long-term commitments to pitchers. The euphoria that immediately followed the surprising $50 million signing of Jimenez is long gone. Instead, after five starts, he has pitched only 27 innings \xe2\x80\x93 allowing 20 earned runs on 33 hits and 17 walks. Opponents are batting a perfect .300 against him, and all of this adds up to an ERA of 6.59.You know what is coming next, right? Yes, Jimenez is a notoriously slow starter in his career. What else is there to hang hopes on than that historic truth? Well, I will say that his ball movement is about as good as anyone\xe2\x80\x99s on the Orioles. However, his ability to command the baseball is the absolute worst. Too many balls drift into the sweet spots, and too many drift out of the zone altogether and put extra runners on base and add to pitch counts. This investment may yet pay off; but people with concerns are not crazy!The inability of the starters to go deep into games \xe2\x80\x93 This is not a headline. In fact, most Orioles fans would likely have chosen this out of a list of possible problems as the most likely thing to go wrong for the Birds. It is not a new problem. But, even with only 24 games in the books and basically five turns through the rotation, the trend line is improving. It needs to.The power loss of the offense \xe2\x80\x93 Would you have believed me if I told you a month ago that the Orioles would end April being out-homered by opponents 29 to 17?\xc2\xa0 Or how about this \xe2\x80\x93 Would you have believed me before opening day if I told you that Chris Davis, Adam Jones, and J.J. Hardy would only hit three home runs in their combined 253 plate appearances in April?The worst winter in recent memory has turned into the worst April for baseball in many years, and that weather has been a contributing factor. And honestly, power is not everything. The Baltimore Orioles are still the #5 offense in the American League, and they have been at the top in terms of batting average with runners in scoring position.Chris Davis injury \xe2\x80\x93 Even without the injury, Davis might have made this list. April of 2014 has looked nothing like the incredible first month of 2013 with its nine home runs. Clearly, Crush is being pitched entirely different than before \xe2\x80\x93 evidenced by his high number of walks and .372 OBP. The over-shifts are seen everywhere. Davis is going to have to make adjustments to such factors.But before he can make the adjustments, he is going to need to get back onto the field after his stint on the DL with the oblique injury. There is much uncertainty surrounding this, and one has to wonder what the long-term ramifications of this will be for a fellow of his size and strength. Will he be able to prevent a recurrence of such troubles?David Lough is too low \xe2\x80\x93 Lough is not going to be an all-star \xe2\x80\xa6 not this year. and likely not any year. But the talent appears to be there to have a productive player with a variety of skills. The concussion-like symptoms have been a setback, and I have to wonder if there was not more to that issue than was publicly known. But in any event, a recent win that was largely facilitated by Lough\xe2\x80\x99s three hits, base running, and defensive plays was a demonstration of what he is able to do to make a total difference in a game. I still think Lough is going to become a fan favorite in Baltimore, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t happen with his current .172 batting average, no matter how many highlight reel catches he makes.

I can only imagine if the Orioles had an easier schedule to start the season where they would be. The numbers have not quite shown up for the Orioles. The homeruns are right near the bottom of the AL, while they are in the top 10 for doubles and top five for triples. The offense is present, which is especially clear in Nelson Cruz who has started with a great season for the Orioles. In the few games I have watched, the consistent problem with the Orioles is the pitching. But that is not a new problem, it is the same problem the Orioles have every year. The Orioles have the fifth highest ERA in the AL and the sixth highest in the entire MLB.However, the pitching has not been walking many players, but they have not been striking out players either. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers have the highest batting average against them in the entire MLB. Overall, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching is letting down the team again.Even though Chris Tillman has a 3-1 record in five games started has a 3.38 ERA, there is the high ERA to worry about. Wei-Yin Chen has the same problem. He has a 3-1 record in five games started, but a 4.34 ERA. Ubaldo Jimenez has been a major letdown. He sits winless with an ERA reaching above six. Despite his recent struggles in his career, I was hoping he would turn it around with the Orioles, but he has yet to show he has changed. As a team, the long ball is still hurting the Orioles giving up the second most in the AL. But the Orioles have only given up the eighth most earned runs at 107. The defense, even without Manny Machado, is second in the AL in fielding percentage and second in fewest errors committed at 10. The Orioles are third in the AL with 27 double plays. As I examine the Orioles, I see that they either live or die by the long ball. The pitching has allowed more than 10 more homeruns than the Orioles have hit and that is not the way to win games. If the Orioles could improve upon just one of these aspects, the next month of baseball could be played much differently. If the pitching becomes better, I expect great things from the Orioles in the month of May, in which, I will get to watch more than the games that just play on ESPN.\xc2\xa0  ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

It was not a happy experience for the big right-hander. He gave up six earned runs on eight hits, as just about everyone in the lineup got a single or double \xe2\x80\x93 including Jake Arrieta, the winning pitcher, who singled in the top of the first before even getting to throw a pitch.This will be start #6 for Morton, who has a current ERA of 4.35 over 31 innings. Actually, three of his five games have been quality starts. His most recent outing was against the Reds where he allowed three runs on four hits over six innings; however he also gave up five walks.The Orioles will send Budd Norris out for his fifth start of the season. He is currently 1-2 with a 4.44 ERA, though his WHIP is a respectable 1.23.Having pitched for the Astros when they were a National League affiliate, Norris has a more extensive record against the Pirates than would typically be true of an American League pitcher.

John Q In this 2002 movie, John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington) and his wife are watching their young son, Mikey, play little league ball. Archibald, wearing an orange Orioles pullover jersey, and his wife, wearing a hat featuring the orthinologically correct bird, watch Mikey beat out the throw for an infield single. Called safe, Mikey takes a turn for second as his teammate attempts to score, but he collapses shortly thereafter. Needing a heart transplant for his son, John Q. takes several hospital staff members and emergency room patients hostage after he learns his insurance will not cover his son\'s transplant.     Head of State After being plucked from the unemployment line to serve as the minority presidential candidate, Mays Gillam (Chris Rock) overcomes long odds to win the election. One can imagine that his appearance at Camden Yards,\xc2\xa0where he tossed the ceremonial first pitch before a sellout crowd, went a long way in improving chances. The West Wing The second member of the Sheen family to film in Camden Yards,\xc2\xa0Martin Sheen tossed a ceremonial first pitch for the season finale of The West Wing. Sheen, who played President Josiah Bartlet in the popular NBC series, actually waited through a rain delay before to his cameo prior to an Orioles win over the Blue Jays. In addition to the weather delay, the crowd waited through Sheen\'s inaccuracies, as it took him four attempts to record a strike to then-catcher Javy Lopez.

Depressed in his apartment after the love of his life finds out about his wild lifestyle, John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) decided to watch his favorite baseball team. Listen closely and you\'ll hear that former right fielder Jay Gibbons just hit a go-ahead homerun against the White Sox. A bleacher report article has determined that the exact game that Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s character was watching occurred on May 5, 2004, a\xc2\xa06-5 Orioles loss.

McNulty closely watches his estranged wife, also at the game, as she\xe2\x80\x99s dating a politician of interest to the detectives. Scenes from action between the Orioles and visiting White Sox are shown in between the season three monologue, most notably with Miguel Tejada recording a base hit before Brian Roberts is thrown out at the plate. Veep In this HBO comedy series, Vice President Selina Meyer (Louis-Dreyfus) hosts an Eat Healthy initiative event at Camden Yards after she was assigned by the president to tackle the country\'s obesity problem.\xc2\xa0Although most of the episode takes place in the stadium\'s suites, Meyer eventually makes her way down to the field to meet the team. Among those in attendance were former Oriole Jake Arrieta, current closer Tommy Hunter, and Hall of Famer Jim Palmer. House of Cards The inspiration for this list, this wildly-popular Netflix series features Vice President of the United States Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) throwing out a ceremonial first pitch at Camden Yards. The noted Orioles fan,\xc2\xa0who actually threw a real ceremonial first pitch against the Blue Jays a season ago, is first seen wearing a jacket featuring the cartoon bird in the tunnel to the team dugout as he is being introduced to the crowd. Former closer Jim Johnson and outfielder Nate McLouth meet Spacey\xe2\x80\x99s character on the field,\xc2\xa0with Johnson expecting to receive the pitch as the stadium lights suddenly go out. For added realism, the crowd even yells ""O"" during the national anthem.   Note from Stacey: One addition to the list!

The Orioles defeated the Pirates 5-1. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsFor the Baltimore Orioles and the Minnesota Twins, there are a number of striking similarities entering the first game of a three-game series. Just 24 hours ago, each team had a record of 12-12; and each played a doubleheader. However, the Orioles swept to two wins over the Pirates while the Twins dropped their twin bill to the Dodgers.But here is another similarity in the pitching matchup for this evening: Ubaldo Jimenez of the Orioles ($50 million, 4-year contract) will be going against Ricky Nolasco of the Twins ($49 million, 4-year contract). So what can an extra million dollars buy you in the free agent market these days? It is clear \xe2\x80\x93 Jimenez comes into the game with a 6.59 ERA, while Nolasco languishes a million bucks behind a 6.67!You simply can\xe2\x80\x99t find this sort of quality analysis just anywhere!Orioles fans are worried today about how the bullpen was used up in the late doubleheader at Camden Yards. Over 19 innings of baseball, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pen pitched nine of them. However, the Twins have a worse situation with their relief corps throwing over 12 innings last yesterday. Certainly the Twins did get more sleep \xe2\x80\x93 at least in a real bed and not on an airplane.Jimenez is looking for his first decent start as an Oriole. He enters the game 0-4, having given up 33 hits and 17 walks in 27.1 innings.Known as a notoriously slow starter (at least that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re hanging our hats on), maybe this will be the breakout game for him here in this new month of May! Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m reaching here for good news.But to add to our worries, weather.com reports that it will be 54 degrees at game time tonight \xe2\x80\xa6 which is still about 25 degrees too cold for Ubaldo. Of course, these meteorologists are the same weather people who yesterday said there was 0% chance of rain in Baltimore! Two rain delays later has my faith in them shattered.And then there is this statement of confidence from Jimenez himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI know things have to change. Hopefully I get it going in May. It seems like every time I go out there I find a way to lose the game.\xe2\x80\x9dHere are Ubaldo\xe2\x80\x99s stats for this season / career versus the Twins / total career\xe2\x80\xa6WLERAGGSIPHRERHRBBSOAVGWHIP2014 Stats046.595527.133202051721.3001.83Vs.

Jimenez dropped his ERA from 6.59 to 5.19, after leaving with one out in the eighth following Eduardo Escobar\'s double.Zach Britton stranded the runner with a groundout and a called third strike on Joe Mauer, and Tommy Hunter picked up his eighth save in nine tries by pitching the ninth. Trevor Plouffe led off with a double, but Hunter struck out the next two and ended the game on a groundout.Ricky Nolasco (2-3) gave the Twins a complete game, giving up nine hits and one walk while striking out six for his eighth career nine-inning appearance.Cruz doubled in the fourth, scoring on a double by Matt Wieters, before his soaring drive into the third deck above left field followed a leadoff single by Manny Machado in the sixth inning. Cruz, who entered the night tied for fourth in the league in homers, has gone deep eight times already with his new team.""Just made a bad pitch on him. Didn\'t get it where he wanted to, and the guy got him,"" Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said.The sign that this would be Jimenez\'s night came in the third inning, when Sam Fuld and Escobar each reached base. The 30-year-old right-hander with the herky-jerky delivery dug in and struck out the side after that: Brian Dozier, Mauer and Plouffe.""You tip your hat to him. He made some really good pitches,"" Gardenhire said. ""We\'ve seen that before when he was with other ballclubs. He\'s a guy who can get in a little trouble, and he knows how to turn it up to another level and the ball comes out even a little hotter.""From the third into the eighth, Jimenez retired 16 of 17 batters, with the only outlier a fielding error by second baseman Jonathan Schoop that put Escobar on with two outs in the fifth.""He seemed to be pretty much cruising all night,"" Fuld said.Jimenez, who threw a season-high 118 pitches, had issued 17 walks in 27 1-3 innings over those prior five starts. Three runs allowed was his lowest total.Nolasco, who received the richest deal the Twins have ever given a free agent from another team, likewise has had a rocky start to the $49 million, four-year contract he signed with the club. But only on the road, where the right-hander has taken the mound four times.""Ricky pitched well enough to win, for sure. Yeah, it\'s frustrating. Good teams find a way to win when a pitcher throws a game like that,"" Fuld said.In two turns at Target Field, Nolasco has allowed just four runs on 14 hits and two walks in 17 innings.""Just trying to go out there and give us some innings and a chance to win,"" Nolasco said.These were two tired teams taking the field, each forced into a doubleheader the day before by wet weather prior to that. The Orioles swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in Baltimore on Thursday and arrived in Minneapolis around 5:30 a.m.The Twins had the benefit of being at home, but after a Wednesday night game that lasted 3:38 they were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday in games that took 3:01 and 5:11. The last one, the longest game in five seasons at Target Field, took 12 innings. They used three pitchers in the first game and eight more in the second one.NOTES: Mauer is tied for the team lead with 30 strikeouts. ... The Orioles will send LH Wei-Yin Chen (3-1, 4.34 ERA) to the mound on Saturday afternoon, and RH Kevin Correia (0-3, 7.33 ERA) will pitch for the Twins. Chen has won both of his road starts this year. Correia gave up eight runs in only 2 1-3 innings in his last turn. ... Correia went down to the bullpen as the emergency pitcher in case the game kept going the night before. Was he warming up, Gardenhire was asked? ""No, he was freezing,"" Gardenhire quipped. ...

The rain lingered long enough to delay the fifth inning of the opener by 21 minutes, and the start of the nightcap was stalled 46 minutes by rain.The second game lasted 3 hours, 57 minutes. By the time it ended, the clock had ticked well past midnight.""It\'s not a late night, it\'s an early morning,"" said Orioles reliever Darren O\'Day, who pitched in both games.As O\'Day spoke, the team had 30 minutes to get ready for a trip to Minnesota for a three-game series that was to begin Friday night.""It will be a happy flight,"" O\'Day said, ""so that will make it a little easier.""The second game marked the season debut of Orioles third baseman Manny Machado, who had left knee surgery in October. After sitting out the opener, Machado received a warm ovation from the crowd of 28,290 before the second game and went 0 for 5.Baltimore trailed 4-0 in the nightcap before rallying with a four-run sixth. Adam Jones doubled in a run and scored on a single by Wieters before Pearce chased starter Brandon Cumpton with a double to right. Bryan Morris entered and yielded a two-run double to J.J. Hardy.Starling Marte countered with an RBI single in the seventh for Pittsburgh, but Markakis tied it in the bottom half with a solo shot off Morris.Wieters won it in the 10th with a drive to right off Pimentel (2-1) that soared just inside the foul pole.Tommy Hunter (1-0) got two outs for the win.Earlier, Baltimore ace Chris Tillman struggled through a 49-pitch first inning that could be attributed in part to a seven-day layoff. The right-hander issued three walks, two with the bases loaded, before getting three outs.Pittsburgh ended Tillman\'s outing in the fifth when Andrew McCutchen doubled and scored on a triple by Gaby Sanchez for a 3-0 lead.Pedro Alvarez had four hits for the Pirates, finishing a home run short of the cycle. But Pittsburgh stranded 15 and went 5 for 16 with runners in scoring position and lost for the 15th time in 19 games.""We keep fighting and fighting, and we put ourselves in scoring position and we haven\'t been able to cash in the way we need to,"" manager Clint Hurdle said. ""But we keep showing up. The bats were better throughout the series. ... We had men on base throughout the game, and still looking for that big hit.""The first game was all about Pearce, designated for assignment by Baltimore on April 22 and released five days later. After turning down an offer from Toronto, the first baseman was re-signed Monday after Chris Davis went on the 15-day disabled list.Pearce singled in the third, fifth and sixth innings of the opener and was solid in the field.""Stevie gave us a real lift,"" manager Buck Showalter said.Alvarez had two hits and an RBI for the Pirates, who stranded 13 and went 1 for 14 with runners in scoring position. The defeat ended Pittsburgh\'s nine-game road winning streak in interleague play.Trailing 1-0 when the rain stopped play, Baltimore regrouped during the break and sent nine batters to the plate in a three-run fifth. After a single, walk and an error loaded the bases against Charlie Morton (0-4), Pearce hit an RBI single and Ryan  Flaherty grounded an opposite-field, two-run single to left field.Pearce singled in a run in the sixth, and Markakis hit his first homer of the season in the seventh for a 5-1 lead.Orioles starter Bud Norris (2-2) allowed one run in 5 1-3 innings, and Hunter got the last out with runners on second and third for his seventh save.Morton started well but came unhinged after the rain delay and lost his fourth consecutive start. The right-hander permitted four runs, two earned, and seven hits in 5 1-3 innings.""I kept grooving fast balls to Steve Pearce and he kept putting good swings on them,"" Morton lamented.NOTES: Pittsburgh returns home to face Toronto on Friday night. ... Orioles LHP Troy Patton returned from a 25-game suspension before the second game.  Baltimore also activated Machado from the DL, and optioned INF Steve Lombardozzi and RHP Josh Stinson to Triple-A Norfolk. ...

If Ubaldo can generally repeat the performance against the Twins over the course of 2014, he will prove to be worth the investment and will make a huge difference in the possibilities of Baltimore baseball stretching into October.Matt Wieters narrowly missed two homers \xe2\x80\x93 settling for a single and RBI double, while Nelson Cruz missed nothing whatsoever in his perfect swing on a monster two-run shot into the third deck. Together these hits drove in the three runs that gave the Baltimore Orioles a series opening 3-0 win.Wieters is certainly an entirely new person this year from the left side of the plate. He has talked about some swing modifications, and the results are impressive. This is the hitter that was anticipated from the very beginning when Matt joined the Orioles organization.The First Place Baltimore OriolesThe win moves the Orioles into first place in the AL East after Tampa Bay sent the Yankees to a 10-5 loss in 14 innings.

While Schoop was able to show some power at the plate early on, his defense at the position was suspect. He committed four of his team-leading five errors at third base.After showing that he was better suited for his natural position of second base, Schoop began to struggle offensively. He\xe2\x80\x99s received a steady diet of off-speed pitches, and has responded with 27 strikeouts over his 88 at-bats, which is second-highest on the team behind Adam Jones.Now, Schoop has to wonder if manager Buck Showalter will have more patience with him than the prospect has shown at the plate.All can agree that regular at bats and playing time are the best thing for Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s development. If Schoop continues to hamper the major league team by giving away unproductive outs, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible he sees those at-bats at AAA Norfolk.Meanwhile, fellow second baseman Jemile Weeks has shown a more polished approach than Schoop and brings the added ability to switch-hit and to steal bases. Weeks is batting .273 since his call-up in late April.Another potential Orioles second baseman, Steve Lombardozzi, hit .292 during his time with the big league club and went 2-for-2 with three walks yesterday in his first game at AAA.Before Machado\xe2\x80\x99s return, Schoop was needed at the major league level to provide the Orioles another option at third base. Now that Machado is the everyday third baseman and utility man Ryan Flaherty has returned to the bench as his backup, Schoop is no longer an essential piece of the major league club \xe2\x80\x94 just one of at least three second baseman who could see time the bigs.In Weeks and Lombardozzi, the Orioles have two options that have outperformed Schoop so far this season. Schoop may be the best option for the team\xe2\x80\x99s long term plans, but every move the Orioles have made in the offseason and throughout the early part of the regular season indicates that they are in a \xe2\x80\x9cwin now\xe2\x80\x9d mode.Giving Weeks and Lombardozzi an extended look doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean giving up on Schoop in the future, but it does mean exploring all of the options to make the 2014 team better. In order to excel in the highly competitive AL East, the Orioles can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to ignore a weakness. Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s recent performance gives the Orioles a reason to look for ways to strengthen second base. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
05/05/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Reverse Roles of Miguel Gonzalez and ...', '\xc2\xa0Apr 16, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles pitcher Zach Britton throws in the sixth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles defeated the Rays 3-0. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsShould the Baltimore Orioles consider reversing the pitching roles of Miguel Gonzalez and Zach Britton? Gonzalez has struggled greatly this season to go deep into games, and Zach Britton has probably the most effective stuff on the Orioles pitching staff at this moment in time.Gonzalez has not been the only Orioles pitcher to struggle with this issue, but he may be the biggest offender now that the team has essentially gone through the rotation roughly six times. Each of the five starters has shown signs of breaking out of this deadly problem. But clearly it is becoming an issue that must change, and even Buck Showalter cycled back to talk about this in his brief post-game interview yesterday (Sunday in Minnesota).So should Britton be considered to be stretched out into a starter\xe2\x80\x99s role? If it is going to happen this year, it would be best sooner than later. Most Orioles followers, and management as well, have in mind that Kevin Gausman is going to be an effective rotation starter for the latter half of the season. As I wrote quickly in the last article, in my own pitching experience when dealing with pneumonia, there is a systemic weakening that comes with this malady that brings about a fatigue that does not go away quickly. All to say, maybe several circumstances and events are converging toward a shift in strategy.As recently as a week ago I was singing a bit of a different tune: \xe2\x80\x9cBritton has a 1.17 ERA in 10 games with 15.1 innings pitched. Some folks are clamoring for him to become a starter. But at his current pace he will appear in 67-68 games instead of 30 or so as a starter. He is on pace to throw 103 innings \xe2\x80\x93 these innings being at more critical times of games than the 180 approximate total innings he would accumulate if made into a starter.\xe2\x80\x9dMiguel Gonzalez is a very fine pitcher. He has been a great asset for the Baltimore Orioles, and has been that at a bargain price \xe2\x80\x93 lots of bang for the buck here! He is a pitcher and not just a thrower. But as such, his margins for error are small. And after a few innings when fatigue begins to set in, his margins evaporate quickly.The truth is that this is not a recent issue; Gonzalez has often struggled to go deep into games. It is often the 5th or 6th inning where troubles suddenly multiply as the margins evaporate. He has pitched beyond the 6th inning in only 30% of his starts.The statistics on Gonzalez clearly support the argument being made today. His BAA (batting average against) for the first six innings in a game is .237, but it balloons to .323 in the 7th inning and beyond. Similarly, in his first 60 pitches in a game the BAA is .222, but in pitches 61 and beyond it is .279.To be honest and completely fair, it is not as if Britton has career numbers that are categorically different. Zach\xe2\x80\x99s number are actually sort of odd in some regards, as in innings seven and beyond his BAA is an incredible .149 \xe2\x80\xa6 indicating (with a sample size that is not extra large) that when he has been good, he has been very good.But the Zach Britton we see this year does not even look that much like the person in years prior. He is in great shape and pitching at the top of his game.So, having said all that is above, I would suggest that it is time to get Britton in a starting role, and then still use Gonzalez as a longer multiple-innings reliever, or frequent-day reliever. His personality is well-suited for this. He would end up pitching nearly as many innings, and those innings would be at a more effective total ERA.Something will have to be done. The Baltimore Orioles are 27th in all of baseball in total innings pitched by starters. Buck said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf we keep doing this, we are really going to need to pay the piper down the road.\xe2\x80\x9dWhy not pay the piper now? ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), (""The Baltimore Orioles' many days off may help them get on ..."", 'Apr 29, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; A general view of the field covered due to the game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Baltimore Orioles being canceled due to rain at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAnother day for Orioles fans to sit around and do nothing. Seemingly a regular occurrence only a month into the season, rain postponements and scattered off-days have given the Orioles and their fans plenty of days without baseball. Though, it will indeed have its costs, maybe there are some silver linings to this pattern.First, let me say that it probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t extremely popular with the players or manager Buck Showalter that they will have to play 26 games in 27 days starting tomorrow night in Tampa against the Rays. That is a long stretch of baseball to have to play with just one day off.After that run, they will get another off-day on June 1st, followed by 16 straight games against the Rangers (Arlington, TX), the Oakland Athletics (Camden Yards), the Boston Red Sox (Camden Yards), the Toronto Blue Jays (Camden Yards), and the Tampa Bay Rays (Tampa Bay, FL). Yikes. That is as tough a stretch as it gets. But considering the issues the Orioles currently have encountered, the off-days may be more valued now than later.Various injuries to the likes of Manny Machado, J.J. Hardy and Chris Davis have prevented Showalter from writing a lineup with all nine of his starters. We have seen Ryan Flaherty and Jonathan Schoop struggle at times where Machado or Hardy would not, making their absences that much more noticeable. As soon as Machado and Hardy got healthy, Davis got sent to the 15-day DL with an abdominal injury.The off-days may have helped buy the Orioles some time to get healthy. The many days in April where the Orioles did not play may certainly have helped prevent Hardy from going on the DL, allowing him time to recover from his own injuries. This also limited the amount of games that the Orioles would be Machado-less.Since Davis was placed on the DL on April 27, the Orioles have played just four games (including a double-header against the Pittsburgh Pirates). With today\xe2\x80\x99s day off buying Davis more time to get healthy, it is allowing the Orioles to tread water a little longer.Another aspect of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 roster that benefits from these days off is the abused bullpen. As Orioles starters have consistently failed to go deeper than the fifth inning, the bullpen has been extremely taxed early in the season. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters have pitched into the sixth inning or deeper in just 12 of their first 29 games.The many days off early in the season have given the Orioles pitchers time to refresh themselves and bought the front office time to make corresponding roster moves. Most recently, Josh Stinson and Evan Meek were sent to Triple-A Norfolk to be replaced by Troy Patton and Brad Brach. Though Patton was more of an inevitability (as he completed his suspension), Brach offers the Orioles a fresh arm out of the \xe2\x80\x98pen.Although the bullpen benefits from the off-days right now, it is possible that the starting rotation never gets into a groove during the upcoming stretch of games. If that occurs, the bullpen will continue to be overused with very limited opportunities to catch a breath.The off-days have helped the Oriole get healthy and prevent the bullpen from being overworked, but the most vital benefit may be the fact that the struggling Orioles offense is being given time to get on track.This extremely cold and wet spring has prevented the home run dependant Orioles from being the formidable offense that we know them to be. Their 22 home runs ranks 22nd in the majors and their 125 runs has them ranked 18th. Clearly, the Orioles hitters have not flourished thus far in the season.Sure, Nick Markakis, Matt Wieters, and Nelson Cruz have all got off to promising starts, but Hardy, Davis and Adam Jones have combined to hit just three home runs. Jones\xe2\x80\x99 one home run a month in a season is the first such streak he has had since May, 2011.The bats will heat up, but it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that they need time to get going. If the Orioles hitters can start seeing some warmer weather, and the ball starts to carry, the offense may never want to see a day off that would interfere with their streaky hitting.The many early season off-days may give the Orioles the opportunity to get on track and ride into the upcoming marathon of games a little fresher. Maybe the hitters can get into a groove and ride it all the way through June and separate themselves from the rest of the struggling AL East. But, it\xe2\x80\x99s always possible that the struggles continue into this stretch of the season and making matters even worse for the birds.

It\'s a common enough question for a baseball lover in northern Virginia, and the answer comes out almost automatically. \xc2\xa0I grew up watching the Orioles. \xc2\xa0I have no problem with the Nationals, and I go to a few games each year, but the passion just isn\'t there. But it\'s not just a co-worker asking, or a casual acquaintance. \xc2\xa0It\'s my cousin, and we\'re standing in my grandfather\'s house, trying to sort through his possessions. \xc2\xa0He\'s moving from a mostly independent cottage near the water, into a fully assisted living situation, following a slow recovery from a broken hip and a slow decline from a failing heart. \xc2\xa0We\'re all picking through his possessions, trying to decide what he must have even in a smaller living space, what a family member might want as a memento, and what needs to be donated or tossed. He\'s here, with us, seeming more than a bit sad about the whole affair, and yet he\'s not entirely here in the way that most of us will always remember -- he\'s nodding off, and he can\'t seem to keep up with the flurry of activity from nine children and grandchildren trying to get him moved.    It\'s hard to say what\'s worse: Going through this horrible activity that makes me think of my grandfather being gone, or seeing him still here to witness it.    * * * * * * * * * * * Later that night, the family takes my grandfather out to celebrate his 89th birthday. \xc2\xa0The guest of honor still can\'t keep up with the conversation, which at one point drifts to baseball. \xc2\xa0My aunt asks us cousins if we remember the year that grandpa took us to Camden Yards. I hadn\'t thought about that visit in years. Every summer, the cousins would spend a week at our grandparents\' house in southern Maryland, in groups of like age or gender. \xc2\xa0We\'d crab-fish from their pier, eat junk food, and wreak havoc on their lovely retirement home.    One year, Grandpa took four baseball-loving preteen boys for a tour of Camden Yards. \xc2\xa0At 11ish years old, I didn\'t really know that the newly-opened Camden Yards would kick off a noveau-retro design flurry, or swing ballparks back from outlying islands surrounded by oceans of asphalt, back to being integrated downtown attractions. \xc2\xa0What I knew at the time was that the Orioles played there, and that it was awesome for my grandpa to get me access to the dugout, warning track and warehouse on a warm summer day. I knew that Cal Ripken, Brady Anderson, Harold Baines, Chris Hoiles, Mike Devereaux and David Segui sat on that dugout bench, played on that grass (the one place they wouldn\'t let me step) and stood right in that on-deck circle. And maybe to my grandfather it was just a fun afternoon with his grandsons at a notable new Maryland attraction, but to a kid for whom baseball was still magic, it was a lot more. * * * * * * * * * * * I hadn\'t thought about that day in years. \xc2\xa0I had thought about the one and only game I remember seeing at Memorial Stadium, about cheering on the Orioles stars of my childhood, and about several trips up to Camden Yards as a teenager, but I hadn\'t thought about that tour in a long, long time.    And isn\'t that just baseball fandom for you? \xc2\xa0Your identity as a baseball fan can be intertwined with your familial identity in so many ways that you don\'t even routinely remember them all. The kids growing up in Virginia and DC today are forming these kinds of bonds and memories at Nationals Park, and I don\'t begrudge them that. \xc2\xa0If baseball keeps connecting families that way, it doesn\'t really matter where it happens, even if it\'s in a park with ugly attached parking garages and absurd racing Presidents as ""the main event."" \xc2\xa0But for me, real baseball will always involve the crab shuffle, orange uniforms and the Inner Harbor, even if there\'s nothing else remotely Maryland about me. \xc2\xa0I don\'t mind that discrepancy a bit. So no, I\'m not a Nationals fan. \xc2\xa0Maybe I put more meaning into my childhood memories of the Orioles than I should. \xc2\xa0But it seems like something that I can\'t just change about myself with a modicum of sincerity. \xc2\xa0I can\'t just toss or replace my Orioles fandom, like I was forced to choose the fate of so many of my grandfather\'s possessions. \xc2\xa0Loyalty and passion are free, and they don\'t take up any space. \xc2\xa0I can keep them around, even if I can\'t keep Grandpa around forever. \xc2\xa0I can deal with annoying, traffic-laden drives up I-95 ten times a year, in exchange for a feeling of connectedness that goes all the way back to my childhood and spans generations.

05/08/2014,"[('Orioles to wear Negro League throwback uniforms on May ...', "" As participants in\xc2\xa0Major League Baseball's 8th annual Civil Rights Game, the Baltimore Orioles and Houston Astros will honor the Negro League with throwback uniforms on May 30th. The Orioles will don the look of the Baltimore Elite Giants, while the Astros will wear those of the Newark Eagles.    Neither the Orioles or Astros have roots in the Negro Leagues, but the teams will honor a franchise that shared their city in the 1940s and 1950s. The Elite Giants were established as the Nashville (Tennessee) Standard Giants in 1920. When the team moved to Baltimore in 1933, the franchise was rebranded as the Elite Giants, as it would stay until the franchise dissolved in 1950. The Elite Giants won the Negro National Championship in 1936, defeating the Homestead Grays in a five-game series. A number of notable players wore an Elite Giants uniform, including Hall of Famer Roy Campanella, 1952 National League Rookie of the Year Joe Black, and 1953 National Rookie of the Year Junior Gilliam, all of the Brooklyn Dodgers.    The Newark Eagles were formed during a merger in 1936 between two independent league teams, the Newark Dodgers and the Brooklyn Eagles. Combining players from both franchises, the Eagles won the 1946 Negro League World Series, defeating the heavily-favored Kansas City Monarchs in seven games. The franchise moved to Houston in 1949, playing two seasons in the Magnolia City before moving to New Orleans. Shortly thereafter, the Eagles dissolved due to low attendance figures. A number of future Hall of Famers played for the Eagles, including Larry Doby, Leon Day, Monte Irvin, Biz Mackey, and Willie Wells. ESPN Sports Business Reporter\xc2\xa0Darren Rovell tweeted a picture of the uniforms that the teams will wear later this month. As the road team, the Orioles will wear a red and blue reproduction of the Elite Giants' uniforms, which is very similar to the Atlanta Braves' current road look. The Astros' throwback uniforms will feature a simple blue and white scheme. Both teams will wear a Civil Rights Game patch on the right sleeve and left side of the caps.  Last season, the Atlanta Braves (Atlanta Black Crackers), Washington Nationals (Homestead Grays), Detroit Tigers (Detroit Stars), Cincinnati Reds (Cincinnati Tigers), Pittsburgh Pirates (Homestead Grays), Milwaukee Brewers (Milwaukee Bears), Kansas City Royals (Kansas City Monarchs), and the Miami Marlins (Triple-A Miami Marlins) paid tribute with throwback reproductions.    In addition, an Orioles' spokesman confirmed my earlier report that\xc2\xa0the Orioles will wear throwback uniforms on August 24th\xc2\xa0against the Cubs.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""Jonathan Schoop's homer lifts the Baltimore Orioles"", 'One of the big underlying points of last night\xe2\x80\x99s game was that catcher Caleb Joseph made his much-deferred major league debut. Joseph was drafted in 2008, and finally made it up to the big leagues after over six years. After finding out that Matt Wieters wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to the DL, the Baltimore Orioles optioned Jermile Weeks to triple-A Norfolk and officially called up Joseph.Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s first task as a big league catcher was calling the game for starter Bud Norris, and while Norris\xe2\x80\x99 pitch count got up there, for all intents and purposes Joseph called a good game. Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 5.2 IP, 3 H, 2 R, 4 BB, 5 K. A lot of people continue to point to starters\xe2\x80\x99 pitch counts, and perhaps with good reason. However keep in mind that Oriole pitchers have a lot of pitches fouled off on a regular basis. People should be worried if guys are missing their spots; for the most part, that\xe2\x80\x99s not occurring here.The Orioles jumped out to a 1-0 lead when Adam Jones hit the first pitch he saw in the second inning off the ballpark facade in center field. When Jones\xe2\x80\x99 turn in the lineup came around again, he literally did the same thing \xe2\x80\x93 meaning that he hit the ball to the same spot in the park. However Norris struggled a bit in the last of the fifth, allowing David DeJesus to homer on the first pitch of the inning. But to his credit (and to that of Caleb Joseph), Norris pitched out of it.However Sean Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single in the last of the sixth tied the game at two, granting Norris a no-decision on the night. But the O\xe2\x80\x99s were done quite yet either. Steve Pearce got aboard in the top of the seventh with a single up the middle, and Jonathan Schoop followedCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sportsthat up with the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 third homer of the night. Suddenly the Orioles led again, and by two at that.Tommy Hunter gave up an RBI-single in the last of the ninth and had the winning run on first, however he got out of it to record the win. So the Birds find themselves in a situation going into what\xe2\x80\x99s normally a \xe2\x80\x9crubber match\xe2\x80\x9d on the final day or a series whereby they\xe2\x80\x99ve already won the series.Caleb Joseph had a great game behind the plate in his big league debut. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to record his first major league hit, however behind the dish he was invaluable to Oriole pitching. I obviously don\xe2\x80\x99t know, however I suspect that Joseph will be with the Orioles until Chris Davis is ready to return to the club. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear when Matt Wieters will be able to resume the catching duties for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, however the fact is that\xe2\x80\x99s why Joseph is here.As I alluded above, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will have a shot at a sweep tomorrow night in Tampa. Ubaldo Jimenez will take to the mound for the Birds, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s David Price. After a disappointing weekend in Minnesota, a sweep of their division rivals would be a huge pickup for the Orioles. One more thing about Caleb Joseph; kudos to him for hanging in there in the minors for as long as he did. His call up to the big leagues was more than well deserved and earned. A lot of people, myself included, would have given up and/or looked at conventional wisdom telling them that they\xe2\x80\x99d never make it to the big leagues. But his patience and perseverance paid off. I hope for his sake his first game was a pleasurable experience all-around; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the entire day is a moment he\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget.

Absalon-USA TODAY Sports\xc2\xa0Coming into Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s game the Orioles sit three games above .500 and are tied with the Yankees for first place in the AL East. Despite the lack of quality starts and a few injuries to key position players, the Orioles have played themselves to the third best record in the American League. It\xe2\x80\x99s a position few baseball insiders predicted in spring training. One advantage the Orioles have seen this season is the health of their pitching staff. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear the rotation has not been stellar so far, but not a single starter has missed a start. However, over the course of the 131 remaining games this trend is unlikely to continue. When needed, who will be the next person up?The obvious choice would be Kevin Gausman. He struggled at times in the Orioles rotation last season, but eventually became a valuable arm out of the bullpen. Although he started the year in AAA Norfolk, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the Orioles see him being a factor with the major-league squad sometime this season. Gausman has been on a pitch count of around 75, an obvious attempt to keep him fresh for the late season. However, recently Gausman has be shelved due to pneumonia. It\xe2\x80\x99s not something that should force him to miss significant time, but if the Orioles needed an arm in the next couple weeks they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call him up.Dylan Bundy and Johan Santana are seemly on similar paths back to the majors after missing last season with arm surgeries. Santana looks to be close to a rehab assignment, which could make him available by the end of the month. However, with his loss in velocity he may struggle to find consistent success in the AL East. At this point in his career he may be more suited for a long-man/sixth starter spot in the bullpen, which still could be valuable in August and September.Orioles fans are going to be watching Dylan Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s rehab news closely all summer. It may be a slow process as Orioles are going be extremely cautious with their prize arm. Despite the fact that Bundy blew through the minors in 2012 and made an impressive debut in September with the Orioles, he pitched only 105 innings that season before missing last season with Tommy John. When he begins making rehab starts he\xe2\x80\x99ll be on a strict pitch count. Orioles fans expecting him to be a major factor this season may be disappointed. However, he could provide a spark late in the season.The Orioles have several other intriguing arms waiting in AAA. Steve Johnson showed he could have success at the major league level in 2012, but he\xe2\x80\x99s been hampered by injuries the last two seasons and is currently struggling with a shoulder injury. The converted knuckle-baller Eddie Gamboa has had some early success this season with 39 strikeouts to only 9 walks through his first 41 innings. If he can find more consistent success with his knuckle-ball he could be an intriguing arm to watch for later in the season. The biggest disappointment this season may be Suk-min Yoon who has pitched to an Era over 7 through his first six starts, and may be headed for the bullpen where he pitched last season in Korea.Pitching depth is key to any team looking to contend in September, and Dan Duquette has done a good job accumulating quality arms at the lower levels. As the season progresses, it will be interesting to see which arm immerges as the next arm up for the Orioles.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
05/09/2014,"[('5/9: Birds Watcher- Baltimore Orioles: Just enough to win', 'With Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s David Price on the mound, the Baltimore Orioles had to wonder how good their shot at a three-game sweep of Tampa was going into last night\xe2\x80\x99s game. In fact, Price pitched a good game against the timely Oriole bats. However Ubaldo Jimenez pitched just a hair better, as the O\xe2\x80\x99s outlasted Tampa 3-1 for a sweep at Tropicana Field.For the second straight game, Jimenez turned in a solid effort. In his last two starts (including last night), he\xe2\x80\x99s come across as a guy who\xe2\x80\x99s starting to bring it together. However he still was only able to pitch into the sixth inning of the game, due to a high pitch count. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.1 IP, 7 H, 1 R, 2 BB, 3 K. The issue with Jimenez and all of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters is not \xe2\x80\x9cstuff,\xe2\x80\x9d location, command, or anything else. The issue is that the ebb and flow of the games are warranting them to throw a lot of pitches \xe2\x80\x93 whether this is people fouling balls off, or anything else. This is something that needs to change, lest the Birds want to risk someone\xe2\x80\x99s arm falling off down in the \xe2\x80\x98pen.Tampa struck first blood in this one with an RBI-single by Evan Longoria in the last of the first. However the good news is that the Birds didn\xe2\x80\x99t trail for long. J.J. Hardy hit a two-out double,Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sportsand he was then plated by Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x98s two-run homer \xe2\x80\x93 which gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 2-1 lead. That was Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s second homer of the series; there can be no doubt that Pearce has played a huge role for this team offensively since his return, which is pretty much how Buck Showalter envisioned things going.The O\xe2\x80\x99s extended their lead to 3-1 in the fourth when Jonathan Schoop\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single scored Adam Jones. However both teams loaded the bases \xe2\x80\x93 the O\xe2\x80\x99s with nobody out, and Tampa with one gone \xe2\x80\x93 later in the game, and in both situations the pitcher was able to pitch out of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s often tough to win when you can\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of your rival\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes. However if you can do it even one more time than the other guy, your odds at winning go up leaps and bonds.With Tommy Hunter having worked on consecutive nights, Buck Showalter summoned Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day to close the game. O\xe2\x80\x99Day came in to protect the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 3-1 lead, and allowed two base runners to reach base. However a timely double-play and a ground out in the infield secured the game, as the O\xe2\x80\x99s defeated Tampa 3-1. While the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen bent a bit, it certainly never broke.So the O\xe2\x80\x99s now head home in the wake of their three-game sweep of their division rivals. Waiting for them there will be the Texas Rangers, who will come into Camden Yards for three games over the weekend. Wei-Yin Chen will take the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by former Oriole Scott Feldman. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say that Oriole bats are returning to the yard warm, however at least in the Tampa series they were very timely. And now they\xe2\x80\x99ll have the option of heating up, as the weather in their home park will finally be suitable for the ball to fly at the yard this weekend. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Is A Closer a Must for the Orioles? - birdswatcher.com', 'Mandatory Credit: Brad Rempel-USA TODAY SportsWith Jim Johnson being traded away to the Athletics in the off season, the Orioles needed to figure out who their closer was going to be for the upcoming season. They thought they found their man in Grant Balfour, but after failing his physical, the Orioles decided not to sign him. Over the duration of Spring Training, Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette made the decision to make Tommy Hunter\xc2\xa0their closer.Hunter has a solid fastball that reaches the upper 90\xe2\x80\x99s in pitch speed. Unfortunately, he does not have too much command over his other pitches, especially his breaking ball, and he leaves the ball hanging over the center of the plate on many occasions. This leads to the opposing team getting on base with more rapidity than Showalter would like. Actually, Hunter has yet to record a \xe2\x80\x9c1,2,3 inning\xe2\x80\x9d this season.Despite all of this, Hunter is currently tied for the highest amount of saves in the American League at ten total. Whether it is a crucial strikeout with the bases loaded or an acrobatic catch like the one Hunter made to end the game Wednesday night to beat the Rays, Hunter has gotten the job done all but once this season when Showalter called on him to end the game.However, I think I speak for everyone when I say every O\xe2\x80\x99s fan starts to sweat and their hearts beat a tad faster\xc2\xa0when Hunter is on the mound\xe2\x80\x94just like when Johnson was on the mound for Baltimore last season.The question is though: Do the Orioles really need a set closer?Buck Showalter would probably admit that the position of closer is not natural to Hunter. If that is the case, then why not have the relievers just go another inning. Relievers like Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Zach Britton are only getting to pitch one inning at the most each time they get put into the game. Why not just leave them in to record three more outs if they are feeling confident in their ability.Taking Wednesday night\xe2\x80\x99s game for example again; Britton was in full command of all his pitches. He was getting the batters he faced to chase pitches low in the strike zone causing weak ground balls to be hit to the shortstop and back to him.As a former starter, I am sure Britton could pitch two effective innings any given night. No where in the rule book of baseball does it say you have to have a closer. This statement became evident on Thursday night as Showalter put in O\xe2\x80\x99Day to get the save and secure the sweep over the Rays.If you have relievers like O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Britton who hold 0.69 and 0.89 ERA\xe2\x80\x99s, respectively, then is there really any need to put in Hunter just to give up a comfortable two run lead in the ninth and cause all Orioles fans to rip their hair out? I think not. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

DH Xavier Paul and 3B Buck Britton each homered, with Britton falling just a double short of the cycle. LF Steve Lombardozzi, SS Ivan DeJesus, and 2B Alexi Casilla all doubled, and CF Quintin Berry had two doubles. Basically, if you can think of a player on the Tides team, he probably was on base multiple times last night.    As for the pitching, Suk-Min Yoon finally got a win and had a decent night. He lasted five innings and gave up three runs. He struck out two but didn't walk any, and had a 9/3 ground out to fly out ratio. Former Orioles Evan Meek and Josh Stinson also pitched in the game. Neither were great. Evan Meek has completely turned back into a pumpkin as he gave up three runs in 1 1/3 innings. Josh Stinson gave up a triple and then threw a wild pitch to allow a run to score.

He did give up nine hits, but induced two double play balls and picked one runner off of first to keep himself out of trouble. Taylor has now given up just five earned runs in seven starts this season.    On offense, DH Lucas Herbst was 2-for-4 with a home run, and CF Glynn Davis tripled and scored, but also struck out three times. LF Michael Burgess and 3B Joel Hutter also doubled for the Keys.

He struck out one and walked one, and had a favorable GO/FO of 8/4. He gave up a home run to the very first batter he faced, but then cruised until the 5th inning when it fell apart on him. The big blow was a bases-clearing triple with two outs. Jon Keller pitched three scoreless innings in relief with five strikeouts, and Jimmy Yacabonis pitched the ninth for his eighth save.    The Shorebirds offense got to Augusta's starter for five runs in four innings, then tacked on one more in the 8th. LF Conor Bierfeldt was the only Shorebird to go hitless.

He allowed only two runs and struck out five, however, and that's about as good as you can expect if a guy's having significant control problems. The difference between Norris's ERA and FIP looks a bit worrisome, but his HR/FB rate (13.9%) is a bit higher than one would expect (career: 10.9%), so he's probably been a little unlucky on flyballs thus far, driving up his FIP. Porcello has the best ERA of his career so far, with an even lower FIP to match. Part of his success this year is based on a very low walk rate (1.4 BB/9), which approaches Ueharan levels and is much lower than Porcello's career average (2.26 BB/9). Surprisingly, he's doing this with an unusually low groundball rate (43.9%; career 52.5%).  This may be because the righty seems to have changed his approach a bit from last year, throwing significantly fewer sinkers to same-handed batters (55% in 2013, 42% this year) and substituting more sliders and four-seamers. Against lefties, he'll throw a roughly even mix of four-seamers, sinkers, curves, and changeups, using the four-seamer to start at-bats, the change if he gets behind, and the curve to finish them off.

He did allow  nine baserunners, however, so he had to weave out of trouble a few times, and his 2:3 K:BB ratio wasn't so good. Still, at least Bad Ubaldo spared us his presence for one more start. Smyly is back in Detroit's rotation after spending all of 2013 and the first week or so of this season in the bullpen. His ERA looks very good, but he's getting pretty lucky on balls in play (.257 BABiP, career .288) and is stranding a lot more runners than one would expect. Smyly, a lefty, threw four-seam fastballs and cutters 85% of the time last year, dropping in a curve for the rest. This year, he's throwing the curve a lot more and trying to disrupt right-handed batters' timing with occasional changeups (8%). He throws first-pitch four-seamers very reliably, nearly 75% of the time regardless of batter handedness.

He's managed to cut down on walks a little compared to the last two years, and his groundball rate is over 40% for the first time since he came to the U.S. His ERA is nearly a run higher than his FIP, and while he's gotten a little lucky on flyballs so far (7.0% HR/FB vs. 10.6% career), he's been unlucky on balls in play more generally (.351 BABIP vs. .295 career). The main trouble with Chen is knowing when to pull him, because once he gets tired, he tends to fall apart rather than slowly decline. Managing seven innings in two of his last three starts probably isn't a sign that's changed, since those were against the Astros and Royals. Verlander's numbers look about as intimidating as ever, but there are some chinks in the armor this time around. His strikeout (7.17 K/9) and walk (3.50 BB/9) rates are the worst they've been since 2008, and he's gotten very lucky on flyballs so far (1.5% HR/FB). Camden Yards would be a nice place for the inevitable regression to happen. Verlander's pitching about the same as last year, throwing fastballs just over half of the time to both righties and lefties. Against righties, he'll throw sliders in any count, mixing in occasional curveballs and rare changeups. Against lefties, the righty throws the change to get ahead and turns to his curveball for the strikeout.    Maybe hot: J.J. Hardy (.853 OPS, 35 PA) Likely not: Adam Jones (.423 OPS, 32 PA)  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The Tigers defeated the Orioles 4-1. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles dropped a series opening game with the Detroit Tigers 4-1 Monday night at Oriole Park. The battery of Bud Norris and Steve Clevenger provided just about the only power the Birds could muster, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough.Norris pitched a very good game. He was one out away from finishing eight innings and giving up only two runs. But a two-out homer by Ian Kinsler took the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 2-1 lead up to 4-1 and set up Torii Hunter to be drilled with the next pitch. Hunter was miffed, benches cleared, Norris got tossed, colorful words were shared, names were stricken from Christmas card lists \xe2\x80\xa6 but the score remained the same.New reliever Preston Guilmet came on and faced nothing less than Miguel Cabrera for his first batter, getting him to ground into a force out, while also putting down the Tigers in order in the ninth inning. Guilmet had some nasty looking stuff and on first appearance would seem to be a good acquisition.The Baltimore Orioles actually outhit the Tigers in this game 6-5, but never got a hit with a runner in scoring position. Clevenger would tally one-half of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 hits, driving in a run with one of his two doubles. Nick Markakis had his hitting streak come to an end.For Clevenger in his 15th game of the season, his doubles total now is eight. If he could sustain that pace over a full season, he would get 84 doubles and break the all-time record of 67 \xe2\x80\x93 set in 1933 by Earl Webb of the Red Sox. While looking up that isolated piece of information, it was interesting to see that Brian Roberts is actually 13th on that MLB all-time list with his 56 doubles in 2009.Face it, you can\xe2\x80\x99t get information like this on just any Orioles blog!Going back to Norris \xe2\x80\x93 which is what Torii Hunter would like to do \xe2\x80\x93 I like this guy a lot more than I did a few hours ago. I like that he pitched a very good game \xe2\x80\x93 good enough to win most nights and better than the stats would indicate. Even the home run by Kinsler was hit on a pitch that was up and in \xe2\x80\xa6 not really something floating over the heart of the plate.Did he hit Hunter intentionally? Maybe. Or maybe it was just to back him off the plate a bit, and the bit was too big. Is that so bad? No. Is Torii Hunter justified in getting angry? Yes, probably. Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s baseball and is a part of the game. I like the passions on both sides.I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this too: This Detroit Tigers team is really a strong outfit. There is a reason they\xe2\x80\x99ve got the best record in the AL right now. With that pitching, complemented with a really good lineup, they are in my mind the best team in the league.But if the Baltimore Orioles desire to be the best in the game, they have got to beat the best teams, and tonight is the best time to do that.The Tigers will start 24-year-old Drew Smyly. In four starts and six games this year he is 2-2 with a 2.96 ERA. In his last two starts, Smyly shut out Kansas City over seven innings on two hits, but then was beaten most recently by the Astros. He did gain the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 win over the Orioles back on April 4th by going three innings and giving up only a hit and a walk. Few Orioles have seen him more than once or twice.The Orioles will look to Ubaldo Jimenez for more proof that the problems of April are a thing of the past for him. He has won his last two starts while giving up only one run on 10 hits in 12.2 innings. But the more telling number is only three walks over that time. In his first five games Jimenez gave up 17 passes in 27.1 innings. The stuff is great; controlled command is the key to success or failure.Jimenez did not pitch against the Tigers at the beginning of the season. Over his career, he has a record of 5-9 against Detroit with a 5.32 ERA in 16 starts. He has given up 100 hits and 40 walks in 89.2 innings \xe2\x80\xa6 ugh, not good.Against Jimenez, Miguel Cabrera is not surprisingly 14-for-41 (.341), though with only one homer. Victor Martinez is 7-for-21 with three homers, Austin Jackson is the same though with only one homer, Torii Hunter is 7-for-18 with no homers, and Ian Kinsler is 4-for-14.Jimenez had better bring his \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d game. It would also be helpful to see some more runs scored.

In fact, he took down the Oriole-champion,\xc2\xa0J.J. Hardy, in a spring training tournament*facts from MLB.com\'s Brittany Ghiroli   History Pearce played four years of college baseball. From 2002 through 2003 he was a member of Indian River Community College. After that, he transferred to South Carolina and played in both 2004 and 2005. While a Gamecock, he was impressive, hitting .346 with 21 home runs and 70 RBI as a junior and setting a school-record with a 1.000 fielding percentage at first base. His senior year was a worthy follow up; .346 average with 21 home runs and 63 RBI. In 2003, Pearce was picked by the Minnesota Twins in the 45th round \xc2\xa0of the amateur draft. He would not sign and instead enrolled at South Carolina. He was again drafted in 2004. This time in the 10th round by the Boston Red Sox. Yet again, he declined and returned to Columbia. He finally signed following his senior year, when he was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the eighth round.    In the minors, Pearce was well-regarded for his work with the lumber. Following a 2007 season that saw him climb quickly from the high-A Lynchburg Hillcats all the way to the Pirates big league squad, he was named the #89 prospect in the minors by Baseball America and the third best prospect in Pittsburgh\'s system. That same season also saw him capture the title of ""Best Hitter for Average"" and ""Best Power Hitter"" down on the Pirates farm.    Even though he made it to the big league club at a steady pace, Pearce never really stuck with the Pirates. He played in parts of five different seasons, never getting into more than the 60 games he saw in 2009. His power potential also failed to materialize, managing a meager nine home runs in those five seasons. Following 2011, Pearce would begin a whirlwind of transactions. He was granted free agency by Pittsburgh. He would sign with the Twins, but was released a week before Opening Day. The Yankees snapped him up two days later. He wouldn\'t make it into a game for the big league squad before the O\'s purchased his contract. Baltimore kept him for nearly two months before trying to sneak him through waivers. He wouldn\'t make it; Houston selected him and placed him right into the starting lineup.    Pearce stayed with the Astros for one month until a former team came calling. This time it was the Yankees again, who purchased his contract from Houston. Another month after that, the Orioles were able to get the versatile ball player the same way they lost him; via waivers. Since then, he has been an Oriole. However, he did nearly become a Blue Jay this past April, but instead he came back to Baltimore for a chance to play while Chris Davis was on the disabled list.   Scouting Report Pearce\'s worth is at the plate. His career major league numbers are nothing to write home about: a .240 batting average, .318 on base and a .386 slugging percentage. However, his numbers coming up through the farm are eye-grabbing. He boasts a .294 batting average with a .371 on base and a .522 slugging percentage in 622 minor league games. But the games in the show are what really count and Pearce has been just OK. The all-encompassing stat of Wins Above Replacement (WAR) reflects that. Fangraphs gives him a 0.5 WAR in his career, while Baseball Reference is a bit more lenient with their 1.2 WAR. Either way, he is considered a borderline major league player.    In the field, the Florida native has major league experience at first base, third base, right field and left field. By far, his skill set fits best at first base. His career zone rating per 150 games is a very good 5.9. That is better than current starter Davis\' rating of -2.3 at the position. Davis was a Gold Glove contender in 2013. However, Pearce rates negatively at the other three positions. So, while that number at first is nice. It isn\'t reason enough to be a regular in the big leagues when he doesn\'t have the power numbers to back it up.   What\'s Ahead There is a reason that Pearce has bounced between so many squads. He is good enough to be on a major league roster, however, not good enough to lock down a full time spot. His bat still has power potential and he plays a good enough defense to serve as a late-inning replacement on some teams. That said, he is 31 years old and the time to play the ""potential"" or ""upside"" card has nearly run out. This is a player that the Orioles value and don\'t want to lose. He provides depth at first and the corner outfield positions. As seen already this season, he can fill in admirably when needed. However, it\'s a numbers game and Pearce\'s career numbers seem to show that he will have a difficult time becoming anything more than a serviceable backup.

The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 inconsistencies are going to continue to get the better of them until they solve the problem.The Orioles lost to the Detroit Tigers 4-1 to fall to 20-16, while the Tigers improve to 22-12. The Orioles maintain a hold on first place in the AL East ahead of the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox by a game and a half.Bud Norris pitched a great game with exceptions in the fourth and eighth innings. After retiring the first nine batters, he failed to disguise his pitches and the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 hitters took advantage the second time through the lineup to take a 2-1 lead.Norris impressed me by how he settled down to keep the Orioles in the game. Buck may have left him in the game too long, which led to the game-sealing two-run home run and Torii Hunter being hit by a pitch, which cleared the benches.The defense continues to play well, which, as was said last season, is a consistent part of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 game. The Orioles would not be in the position they are without some consistent part.Without consistent pitching or offense, a 20-16 record is a very surprising record. If the Orioles can maintain a consistent offense or pitching, their record would be much better.In the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 wins in May, they have scored 35 runs, while allowing 20 runs. The offense averages above four runs per game, while the pitching holds the opposing teams below three runs in eight wins.Throughout the entire beginning part of the season, the Orioles win nearly all the games where they score four or more runs.The four-run mark is a common number across MLB for teams to win. In order to reach that mark, there must be pitching and offense.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense averages about four runs per game through 36 games. This would be a great number, but the pitching averaged just above four runs per game.The Orioles rarely have good pitching and offense simultaneously\xc2\xa0to put together long winning streaks.\xc2\xa0This has seemingly always been a problem for the Orioles, but really should not be\xc2\xa0relative to\xc2\xa0the powerful lineup they have.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching has frequently\xc2\xa0been the problem, and it continues to be the problem this season.\xc2\xa0And this is magnified when the offense also struggles to be consistent.For just the month of May, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching is allowing an average of just above three runs per game.\xc2\xa0However, the offense is averaging the same as the pitching is giving up, which leads to games like the last two Orioles losses. The offense goes just below average, while the pitching is average, and the result is a loss.The Orioles have been successful the past two seasons, but have barely been successful. Short streaks of offensive games or good pitching brought them into the playoffs two seasons ago and brought them close last season.In order to make a bigger impact, there needs to be consistency across the team. The Orioles need to figure out these aspects of their game in order to put together more than just streaks of offense and pitching, but make it a part of who they are as a team.

Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 2 BB, 7 K. Jimenez pitched to contact all night, and the fact is that Detroit seemed to have no clue what was coming. If they did, they had no clue how to get to it. For all of the struggles in April, Jimenez made one of the best batting orders in the major leagues look human.Unfortunately, Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s effort went to no avail. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, most pitchers will get 30 starts over the course of a season; 10 good, 10 bad, and 10 in-between. If you can somehow get a win out of those in-between starts (or even a bad one), you\xe2\x80\x99re really in good shape. However when you end up losing and wasting a starting pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s good outing, you might want to start considering providing your starters and bullpen with more production in the runs column.The Baltimore Orioles took an early 1-0 lead on Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 first inning home run, and that lead stood up as the only run to cross the plate \xe2\x80\x93 until the ninth inning. However while most fans are going to remember Tommy Hunter\xe2\x80\x98s blown save (and\xc2\xa0only\xc2\xa0Tommy Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s blown save), you can\xe2\x80\x99t fault Hunter for the O\xe2\x80\x99s going 0-for-7 with RISP in the game. You can\xe2\x80\x99t fault Hunter for four different Orioles putting up zeros in the hit column.The point is that you win and lose as a team. Again, people will remember Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s issues, and perhaps rightfully so. But overall if the Orioles can start to put more runs on the board perhaps they aren\xe2\x80\x99t in save situations late in games. For the record, all lineups go through times when they don\xe2\x80\x99t hit. I think it would be a tough sell to suggest that the O\xe2\x80\x99s don\xe2\x80\x99t have a potent lineup, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just my view.Alex Avila led off the ninth with a single to left field \xe2\x80\x93 against the shift. That in and of itself is not something that should be lost on Baltimore Orioles fans; if the O\xe2\x80\x99s play their infield straight away against Avila, that ground ball is put out by Manny Machado. So is Buck Showalter to blame in that sense? I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if \xe2\x80\x9cblame\xe2\x80\x9d is the right word, however the Orioles played the odds \xe2\x80\x93 and lost.Following a Kinsler line out, Rajai Davis (who pinch-ran for Avila) was thrown out attempting to steal second by Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 catcher Caleb Joseph. Detroit manager Brad Ausmus immediately asked for a review, and umpire Bob Davidson agreed to it. Replays were inconclusive \xe2\x80\x93 or they appeared to be at least. However Davidson ruled Davis safe at first after the review, much to the protest of Showalter and the Orioles.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsSo long story short, Torii Hunter was down to his final strike before taking a walk following the controversial call at second base. Miguel Cabrera hit a three-run homer, which was followed by a Victor Martinez solo shot, and the Orioles fell 4-1.The instant replay of course was the key call, as that would have been the second out of the inning. My personal opinion on the call was that it could have gone either way. Had they initially ruled Davis safe, that call should have been upheld. Thus the same should have been true with Davis being ruled out. However Buck Showalter said after the game that it was an angle or view on the Detroit broadcast that put the umpires over the top that he was safe. So without seeing that shot,maybe none of us can really say for sure how the call should have gone. But to say the least, this is a totally different article if the call is different.Catcher Caleb Jospeh had a memorable evening, which included his first major league hit and three runners caught stealing. Showalter couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rave about Joseph (and Jimenez) enough after the game, and the effort that the two of them put in on the defensive circuit was memorable to say the least.The O\xe2\x80\x99s will try to salvage one game of three against Detroit as the series wraps up tomorrow in a 12:30 PM matinee game at Camden Yards. That in and of itself is probably a good thing, as it\xe2\x80\x99s always a positive to get right back on the field after a loss like that. The Orioles have activated Kevin Gausman from tirple-A Norfolk, who will make the start this afternoon (moving Wei-Yin Chen back a day). He\xe2\x80\x99ll have a tough task indeed, as he\xe2\x80\x99ll face Detroit ace Justin Verlander. Oriole bats will try to get back on track against Verlander, who they beat back in Detroit in week one of the season.As for Tommy Hunter, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see how he\xe2\x80\x99s handled. If the Orioles are in a save situation tomorrow, will those bullpen gates swing open and reveal Hunter coming into the game? Buck Showalter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be a fan of the \xe2\x80\x9ccloser by committee approach,\xe2\x80\x9d but time will tell. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

The Tigers defeated the Orioles 7-5 completing the three game sweep. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWho would have thought that about one-quarter of the way through the baseball season the American League East would be the division where the leading team would have the worst record of any of the six teams leading divisions? That first-place team is the Baltimore Orioles at 20-18. Of course the Yankees and Red Sox are only a half-game behind at 20-19, and the Jays likewise have 20 wins but against 21 losses. And finally the Rays are last at 18-23.The Baltimore Orioles, like everyone else in the league, can point to varied injuries and missing players as an explanation for some of the problem. Lineups are about as varied as the total number of games. Get Machado back, lose Davis; get Davis back, lose Wieters, etc.But the issue is not limited to this. Inconsistent play is at least as large a factor. Adam Jones has only recently warmed up. Nick Markakis hit through a consecutive games streak, but went completely hitless against the Tigers. Even Nelson Cruz was in a 7-for-35 (.200) prior to his two hits and homer yesterday. J.J. Hardy can\xe2\x80\x99t find any way to hit a homer.That is the offence. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not even go into the pitching, since so much has been written about it by everyone, along with it being the area of greater concern going into the season. Who would have expected this offense to struggle so much, especially at home?A mark of a team simply being out of sync and not playing well is an inability to put the offence and defense together. For some reason, it simply happens this way. A team will lose three close, low-scoring games, but then finally have a breakout day at the plate, only to have the opponent score even more. And that sort of describes the current four-game losing streak. The Orioles score four runs in three games, only to score five in one inning against none less than Justin Verlander, yet still lose 7-5.The good news for the Orioles is that even with all of the scuffling of the early season, a record of 20-18 is the best in the AL East, if only by a slim margin.

A number of Royals hitters have good numbers against him: Billy Butler is 8-for-15 with two home runs, Eric Hosmer 6-for-14 with two home runs, Alex Gordon 3-for-13 with 1 home run, and Alcides Escobar 4-for-15.

The O\xe2\x80\x99s had called Kevin Gausman up from triple-A Norfolk to make the start, sending Miguel Gonzalez to the bullpen. Gausman was smacked around in his short outing; after the game Buck Showalter said that he was looking for about 85 pitches out of Gausman in total; Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4 IP, 6 H, 5 R, 2 BB, 2 K. Showalter went onto say that Gausman had a great first inning, although the O\xe2\x80\x99s were looking to get a bit more out of him.Detroit loaded the bases on Gausman in the third, and Miguel Cabrera\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single gave them a 2-0 lead. Just prior to that however Ian Kinsler hit an infield single in order to load the bases\xe2\x80\xa6a ball that might have resulted in an out (the final out of the inning) had it not hit off the mound. When things aren\xe2\x80\x99t going well, those are the types of bounces you get. Detroit would also plate three runs on Gausman in the fourth, netting them a 5-0 lead and chasing Gausman. They would also plate a run in the fifth off of Miguel Gonzalez to run the score to 6-0.So the fireworks started in the last of the fourth with Chris Davis on first base after a walk and Nelson Cruz at the plate. Verlander threw a pitch behind Nelson Cruz (allowing Davis to head to second base), which bristled a few feathers in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout. Whether or not this was \xe2\x80\x9cretribution\xe2\x80\x9d for Bud Norris \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally\xe2\x80\x9d throwing at Torii Hunter on Monday is something that only Justin Verlander knows. However home plate umpire John Tumpane apparently thought something was up \xe2\x80\x93 and thus issued warnings to both benches.In my opinion, this is an alarming trend in baseball, which I\xe2\x80\x99ve started to see across the board. Baseball is a sport that\xe2\x80\x99s always policed itself in a sense, and there is a certain aspect of\xc2\xa0blind American justice in some of these situations. However I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed that whenever something like this happens the umpires immediately are warning\xc2\xa0both benches. Buck Showalter was livid at this yesterday; by warning the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bench Tumpane not only punished the victim in a sense, but he took away the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 ability to pitch inside without risk of a pitcher (and Showalter) being tossed.I suppose the idea behind warning both benches is to head off a fight/bean ball war before it starts. But do umpires and MLB as a whole really want to be in the business of keeping this type of stuff pent up? In old school baseball someone on the Orioles would have thrown over a Detroit player\xe2\x80\x99s head later in the game, and then\xc2\xa0both benches would be warned. Furthermore as Showalter said after the game, the umpires decided to judge intent on Bud Norris on Monday and they threw him out of the game. There had to be a thought that there was intent on Verlander\xe2\x80\x99s part given that they warned the benches \xe2\x80\x93 yet no ejection?However it\xe2\x80\x99s also very possible that Verlander did the Orioles a favor. Their bats, which hadCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportspreviously gone to sleep, seemed to wake up. Adam Jones and Chris Davis delivered with RBI-singles in the last of the fifth, and Nelson Cruz came back to the plate with two on. With the count at 1-2, Cruz took revenge on Verlander by smacking a three-run homer out of the park and in the process putting the Orioles right back into the game.The fact is that ultimately the O\xe2\x80\x99s dropped the game 7-5, and in the process were swept in the series. However that\xe2\x80\x99s the type of incident that could help the Orioles to win the war after losing the battle. The act of Verlander throwing behind Cruz, combined with the fire shown by Buck Showalter in going after umpire Tumpane could have been just what the doctor ordered. We won\xe2\x80\x99t truly know that until the Orioles play a few more games, but it seemed to work yesterday.Some people will probably question my commentary above in that it might come across as if I\xe2\x80\x99m advocating fighting. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the case; however keep in mind that more so than any other sport baseball has very old traditions. One of them is that you don\xe2\x80\x99t let other teams show you up or push you around. Traditionally, umpires \xe2\x80\x9cget this.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s Cole Hamels hitting Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Bryce Harper a few years ago. A few innings later Washington hit a Philadelphia batter, and\xc2\xa0then\xc2\xa0warnings were issued. That\xe2\x80\x99s good, traditional umpiring. Sure that\xe2\x80\x99s allowing and perhaps even advocating retaliation on my part, however that\xe2\x80\x99s a part of the game. It\xe2\x80\x99s always been a part of the game, and personally I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something that should always be a part of the game.The O\xe2\x80\x99s will now lick their wounds and head to Kansas City for a four-game set. The Baltimore Orioles remain in first place by a half game over Boston in the AL East, and of course they dropped two-of-three to Kansas City at the yard a few weeks ago. So this is an instance where the Birds really need solid starting pitching and for the bats to prove that they\xe2\x80\x99ve come around. Wei-Yin Chen will get the starting nod tonight, after being pushed back a night in favor of Gausman yesterday.

05/16/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Beginning of the Zach Britton Era?', 'May 15, 2014; Kansas City, MO, USA; Baltimore Orioles relief pitcher Zach Britton (53) delivers a pitch against the Kansas City Royals in the ninth inning at Kauffman Stadium. Baltimore won 2-1. Mandatory Credit: John Rieger-USA TODAY SportsCould it be that a new era in Baltimore Orioles baseball was begun last evening in Kansas City? Zach Britton came on to set down the Royals 1-2-3 in the ninth inning and save a 2-1 victory. It was the first such ninth inning this year, and the first save opportunity for the Orioles after the recent Tommy Hunter implosion.Britton sure had the look of a great closer, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking about fastball velocity, a killer sinker, and aggressive approach. I am equally referencing the body language and pitching mound demeanor. From his first steps running in the from the bullpen to his walks around the mound between outs, there was a body language attitude of \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in control here, and you are not going to be running around the bases; pack your bat bag in the dugout, because we are going home soon.\xe2\x80\x9dBritton has not always looked this way. He never had the nervous fear of a Jake Arrieta or the sometimes overwhelmed confusion of Brian Matusz a couple years ago, but there were times you could see on his face that he was in over his head \xe2\x80\x93 that his stuff just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t working like he wanted, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do to fix it.Could Britton be a successful starter if stretched out into that role? My guess is that, yes, he could be that guy. But could his better role to help this club be what we saw last night? Well, on this date of May 16, 2014 I am going to say \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d to that. With his starter\xe2\x80\x99s stuff and background in pitching for longer periods, could Britton be a shut-down reliever who could pitch in a rather high number of games compared to most others, being brought in more frequently and even for occasional longer stretches than just a final several outs? If so, that is a hugely valuable pitcher. He could impact not only one game every five days, he could have an impact on up to nearly one-half of all games.Over the previous two seasons, Jim Johnson pitched in 71 and 74 games for the Orioles. If Britton were to be just a bit stronger with an ability to return to game after game in varied stretches of the season, it would not take that much more before he is impacting almost half of all Orioles contests. Johnson was 15th in MLB last year in 74 appearances. The highest was 80 games by Joel Peralta of the Rays \xe2\x80\x93 though Peralta only pitched one more inning than Johnson, and the two of them actually faced the exact same number of batters \xe2\x80\x93 291.For reasons we could explore in another article someday, the Baltimore Orioles get into an unusual number of close games in late innings that call upon relievers to shut down an opponent in the final couple of innings with no margin of error. Showalter referenced this very observation a couple of days ago, and since it happens, Zach Britton\xe2\x80\x99s skill could prove the most valuable commodity on this squad.Series Game One \xe2\x80\x93 Orioles 2, Royals 1Even though the Orioles struck out a total of 13 times \xe2\x80\x93 nine of which were against the powerful pitching of Royals starter Yorlando Ventura \xe2\x80\x93 they managed two runs on a walk and homer by Nelson Cruz. Wei-Yin Chen pitched well enough to maintain the lead with only a run given up in 5.1 innings, and the bullpen shut the door the rest of the way, capped off by Britton\xe2\x80\x99s ninth inning.Series Game Two \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Tillman vs. Jeremy GuthrieIn a matchup of a previous top starter versus the current staff leader, Chris Tillman will look to get a victory over former Oriole Jeremy Guthrie.Tillman will also look to get back to top form as displayed in his early games of the season. His most recent set of starts have been rough, making it through six innings only once in the past four. In his last outing against the Astros, Tillman issued five walks in five innings.This will be Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s first start against KC this year. Over his career of four starts against the Royals he is 1-2 with a 9.00 ERA. His one start at Kauffman Stadium lasted 3.2 innings and yielded eight runs on 10 hits. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to report those numbers early in the morning.Guthrie is 2-2 on the season with a 4.80 ERA. As with\xc2\xa0Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s season, both pitchers\xc2\xa0have had a very mixed bag of results: some of which are extraordinary, whereas half of the others were very, very hard work and quite mediocre.Guthrie has three career starts against the Orioles and has done well with a 2-0 record and 1.89 ERA over 19 total innings. The only decent numbers against him are by Nick Markakis at 3-for-8. Delmon Young is 4-for-27, Nelson Cruz 4-for-21, and J.J. Hardy 2-for-11. Chris Davis has a home run in 16 at-bats, but that is all, and Adam Jones is hitless in eight plate appearances.Putting all historic stats together, the Baltimore Orioles have no chance of winning this game.

His offense alone was enough to secure the win behind one-run baseball through five and one-third innings from Wei-Yin Chen, who is now 5-2.Between the large ballpark in Kansas City and a strong pitching staff, the Orioles are going to have trouble scoring runs, despite their success on the road this season. Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s game was proof of this.The Orioles have never had major success in Kansas City, and the pitching is going to have to do well to compensate for the lack of offense.The current Orioles are a combined 10 for 51 with one home run against the next three starters for the Royals. Those starters at the time of this article are Jeremy Guthrie (6 for 26), Danny Duffy (0 for 1), and James Shields (3 for 24, 1 home run) for games two, three, and four of the series respectively.Buck Showalter mentioned the excellent pitching from Kansas City by sayings fans would not be getting discounts on pizza during this series. The local Baltimore-area Dominos give Orioles fans discounts when the offense puts up five or more runs in a win.If the pitching needed to improve, now is the time, because the inconsistent offense is going to have problems overcoming good pitching in a pitcher-friendly ballpark.The remaining Orioles starters, at this time, are Chris Tillman, Bud Norris, and Ubaldo Jimenez.This 2014 Royals team has not faced Tillman or Norris yet, but they did win 5-0 against Jimenez earlier in the season.Jimenez gave up six hits with four walks, while personally giving up three runs (charged with four given up by T.J.

But the Orioles are missing out on both of these trends. Through Monday\xc2\xa0their relievers had struck out only 17.8% of opposing batters, third-worst in the sport and well below the average bullpen K rate of 22.1%. Of the relievers who\xe2\x80\x99ve been around all season, only Ryan Webb (21.9%) and Tommy Hunter (21.5%) are close to average. Then it\xe2\x80\x99s a steep drop to Zach Britton\xe2\x80\x99s 18.3%. Brian Matusz brings up the rear with a 13.8% strikeout rate.    The team's bullpen is\xc2\xa0also well behind the rest of the league when it comes to four-seam fastball velocity. As a group they average 91.3 MPH on their heaters; this is more than a mile per hour slower than the average reliever, who throws 92.6 MPH. 1.3 miles per hour may not sound like a lot, but when it comes to fooling major league hitters, it is. I was curious about these trends and wanted to find out more about them. How long have the Orioles been behind the league? What skills do they bring to the table instead? What is it costing the team? Since 2007 the team's bullpen strikeout rate has generally increased along with the rest of the league\xe2\x80\x99s. And yet they haven't manged to be league-average:     Only in 2013 did the Orioles come close to having a bullpen who can strike out an average amount of batters. And so far, 2014 looks to be the worst year in recent Orioles history.    The rise in four-seam fastball velocity isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising, as fastball velocity correlates well with strikeout rate. Yet again, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are keeping pace with the league-wide trends but still remain below average:  Last year\xe2\x80\x99s bump in average fastball velocity came from moving Tommy Hunter to a relief role as well as getting some innings from Kevin Gausman. These guys both threw 96+ MPH. \xc2\xa0The drop this year comes primarily from losing\xc2\xa0Jim Johnson, who consistently threw over 94 MPH. Just as with strikeout rate, 2014 looks pretty bad for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, although not as bad as 2007 when their relievers averaged 2.1 MPH slower than the league.    If you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bullpen that neither throws gas nor strikes batters out, how do you get guys out? You start by not walking them:  If you're not striking out batters and you're not walking them a lot, they're\xc2\xa0making contact. In this case your best option is a ground ball, and\xc2\xa0it seems the Orioles realize this.  (Note that the above graph is ground balls per plate appearance, not per batted ball which is the more common\xc2\xa0GB% stat. Seeing the rate\xc2\xa0per plate appearance accounts for the fact that the Orioles allow more batted balls than other teams do.)    The Orioles pretty clearly have been selecting relievers who can burn worms. They're so far above average in this regard\xc2\xa0that I wonder if they are purposely trading strikeouts for groundeea. Maybe you can teach a guy a sinker, or how to pitch lower in the zone, easier than you can teach a guy to strike batters out. Groundball specialists\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0could\xc2\xa0also be cheaper than strikeout pitchers. It's possible the groundball pitchers, because they aren't throwing as hard as strikeout pitchers, get injured less frequently. Interlude: My first thought was that the team's bullpen pitches so much that they can't help but have a low strikeout rate. After all if you've got relievers who know they have to pitch multiple innings, they will save some bullets and thus not throw as hard or strike many batters out. It turns out this isn't the case though. The relationship between bullpen usage (as measured by the percent of team innings that starters pitch) and fastball velocity is pretty weak:  If your relievers are throwing around 91.6 MPH, it's just as likely that your starters are going deep (throwing 67.40% of your innings) as it is that they are getting pulled early (throwing 64.70% of your innings). Back to the Orioles. Their relievers also limit line drives and fly balls well:      It's good that the team limits fly balls, because they are\xc2\xa0very bad at letting fly balls leave the yard:  If you were watching Orioles baseball in in 2011, you were probably swearing\xc2\xa0a lot as you watched ball after ball leave the yard. This graph is also interesting because of the\xc2\xa0one-year dip in 2012. The bullpen suddenly became very stingy with home runs at the same time other teams' relievers were serving them up left and right. Unfortunately when you look at it on a timeline like this, 2012's HR/FB rate looks more like unsustainable luck than any kind of skill. Thankfully the bullpen is giving up fewer dingers this year, but so is everyone else's bullpen, so the effect is lessened. How many wins are the Orioles surrendering by focusing on ground balls instead of strikeouts? I\xc2\xa0used linear weights to quantify the difference between a strikeout and a ground ball. If you're not familiar with linear weights, they are an empirical measurement of how many runs per inning a team scores after they do anything on the field (like strike out, hit into a double play, etc.). These weights form the backbone of metrics like wOBA and wRC+. Quick note: this next part is for entertainment/discussion value only. I used data from an old season because that's all I could find, and I used it to analyze a different season. If anyone is aware of newer data from a reputable source,\xc2\xa0let me know in the comments and I'll update this article. Linear weight data is readily available for singles, doubles, home runs, etc. But the most recent batted ball linear weight\xc2\xa0data\xc2\xa0I could find was from 2009 in a comment Tom Tango made on his blog. A comment from Tango still\xc2\xa0holds a lot of weight with me, so I went ahead.    Quoting from David Appelman, Tango wrote that strikeouts are worth about -0.29 runs (the run value varies slightly based on whether it was a K looking or swinging, so I averaged the two values). Ground balls are worth -0.12 runs.\xc2\xa0I\xc2\xa0flipped these numbers to positive values for the pitching team to reflect the fact that a run taken away from the batting team is equal to one added to the pitching team. These weights enable the following calculations:   In 2013, Orioles relievers struck out 460 batters. 460 * 0.29 runs = 133.4 runs that the bulllpen alone prevented with their strikeouts.   The 2013 bullpen also induced about 703 ground balls.\xc2\xa0703 * 0.12 = 84.36 runs that the team prevented with ground balls alone.   The big question is: how many extra games would the Orioles have won if those ground balls were strikeouts instead?   First, assume that all 703 grounders were strikeouts: 703 * 0.29 = 203.87 additionalruns prevented on strikeouts.   Now subtract the 84.36 runs that the team prevented on ground balls, because in our hypothetical scenario those ground balls never happened.   The result is\xc2\xa0119.51 runs.\xc2\xa0Using the equivalency of 10 runs = 1 win, those 11.91 runs represent about 12 wins. That\xe2\x80\x99s the additional number of games we\xe2\x80\x99d expect the Orioles to win if their bullpen had magically converted all their ground balls into strikeouts. It's the theoretical penalty the front office is imposing on the team by hiring ground ball relievers\xc2\xa0instead of strikeout relievers.\xc2\xa0 12 wins\xc2\xa0would have taken the team from 85-77 to 97-65 where they would likely have won the division (since some of those games would have come at the expense of the Red Sox and Rays). But don't run up to OPACY with pitchforks and torches. Striking out 1,160 batters is ridiculous; that would\xe2\x80\x99ve been a 54.2% strikeout rate for the bullpen. What if the Orioles had simply been league-average? The average bullpen struck out 22.3% of batters in 2013; on the Orioles this would\xe2\x80\x99ve amounted to an extra 17 strikeouts. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like a lot, and indeed the improvement is only about a third\xc2\xa0of a win, hardly anything over the course of a season. Even if the team had matched the best-in-baseball 26.5% K rate posted by the Royals pen,\xc2\xa0the Orioles would\xe2\x80\x99ve only gained 1-2\xc2\xa0wins in the standings.\xc2\xa0Again, this discussion\xc2\xa0assumes that the increase in strikeouts came solely from ground balls. It also doesn't take the game situation into account.    The 2014 bullpen is doing much worse;\xc2\xa0they only have 89 K's against 500 batters faced. If they were league-average they'd\xc2\xa0have 111 strikeouts. That's 22 fewer strikeouts or 6.38 additional runs the bullpen is responsible for. Over a whole season that's nearly four wins. The Orioles are at the point where four wins would mean a lot to the team.

When people first started playing a shift on various players it was a novelty that most fans had never seen; now we\xe2\x80\x99re probably at the point to where\xc2\xa0NOT\xc2\xa0playing a shift is the novel concept.However again in using the O\xe2\x80\x99s as a sample, I feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing more and more teams and players hitting against the shift. That contributed to Detroit beating the Orioles on Tuesday night, when Alex Avila led off the ninth inning with a hit against the shift. Avila would later score (granted on a home run), and in doing so represented the tying run. And when I say\xc2\xa0hit against the shift, I mean that had the defense been playing straight away the ball would have been hit right to a fielder (in that case third baseman Manny Machado).As a coach, that would be the most frustrating thing in the world for me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously done my home work and the spray charts are indicating that\xc2\xa0player-x hits the ball to this spot almost exclusively \xe2\x80\x93 to the point to where you decide that it would be stupid not to position your infielders in a shift. And then\xc2\xa0player-x\xc2\xa0basically defies logic and hits the ball to the exact spot your fielder\xc2\xa0would\xc2\xa0have been had you not used a shift.Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThis is not to say that Buck Showalter is to blame for the Orioles losing that game, or that any other manager in similar cases are to blame. However, I do feel like more and more hitters are hitting against the shift league-wide. So how does that affect what managers are trying to do?Ultimately I think a few things are going to start to happen. First off, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see more base runners because hitters will begin to be more well-rounded and not necessarily favor one side of the field. We\xe2\x80\x99ll also start seeing more bunt base hits in the other direction. More base runners are going to mean more runs, which means more high scoring games. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t like pitchers duels, I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re in luck there.But keep in mind that for every action there\xe2\x80\x99s an equal and opposite reaction. The idea behind the shift has been that it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to get guys out. So how can you get guys out while not having to worry about the shift? Ultimately I think more and more pitchers will start pitching to strikeout, as opposed to pitching to contact.This is not to say that either way is right or wrong. Sports are all about adjustments; if you take the league by storm in a sense, odds are the next year the league will have adjusted to you in some manner. To equate this to another sport, the late 80\xe2\x80\x99s/early 90\xe2\x80\x99s Detroit Pistons catered their defense to stopping Michael Jordan. They thus\xc2\xa0adjusted to Jordan, and it worked.My point here is that as trends begin, so do ideas to buck those trends. Another example might be what\xe2\x80\x99s known as the \xe2\x80\x9cread option\xe2\x80\x9d in the NFL. Little by little it seemed that defenses had an answer for it last year. So if hitters start becoming more adept at hitting against the shift (and thus to all parts of the field), pitching coaches will start emphasizing pitching to strikeout. And in doing so, hitting coaches will start putting more emphasis on homers, which obviously have no effect regarding the shift. And so it goes\xe2\x80\xa6We\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see more and more teams playing a shift on the O\xe2\x80\x99s, however what we don\xe2\x80\x99t see are Oriole hitters starting to be able to hit against the shift. Having said that, there\xe2\x80\x99s no time like the present!

The Royals won 1-0. Mandatory Credit: Denny Medley-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles were in danger of being part of history as Danny Duffy had a perfect game through 6.2 innings, but in the end it is just another ugly offensive output in a 1-0 loss.Game 41 \xe2\x80\x93 Baltimore Orioles (22-19) 0 Kansas City Royals (21-21) 1 FW: Danny Duffy (2-3, 1.42)L: Bud Norris (2-4, 3.58)S: Greg Holland (11, 2.25)MVP: Danny Duffy, Perfect game into the 7th inning, 7 IP, 2 H allowed, 2 K\xe2\x80\x99s, 0 BBThe GOOD: The Orioles pitching did another stellar job on Saturday, which is a theme for the team lately. Bud Norris had another excellent start, allowing one run in the first inning which came off an infield single, stolen base, and a single back up the middle. He probably could have finished the game as well. Norris left up 4 hits, only walked 1, and hit another batter.Brian Matusz and Tommy Hunter each came in and did their jobs in getting outs as well.As far as the rest of the game, the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t get no-hit. However, all three players who had hits (Machado, Jones and Cruz all also had bad at-bats). I will get to that in a second.The BAD: The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 stagnant offense continues for another day, but this time it almost made history. Danny Duffy was setting them down through 6 innings, with a perfect game intact. Then Nick Markakis was robbed by Alex Gordon on an incredible diving catch, and you had a feeling that it might be Duffy\xe2\x80\x99s day. But, Adam Jones was able to break up the perfect game with two outs in the 7th.However, the Orioles only had three hits in the game, all singles. And each of those players also had bad at-bats. Manny Machado got a hit in the ninth inning to keep the game alive. However, earlier in the game (4th inning), the count was 3-0 and Manny swung at the pitch and popped it up, on a ball that may have been out of the strike zone. Jim Palmer was not afraid to voice his disdain for that decision.Then in the ninth, Nick Markakis was walked after Steve Clevenger weakly struck out as the pinch hitter. The first pitch was in the dirt and Manny Machado flailed at it, with the ball getting away from Royals\xe2\x80\x99 catcher Brett Hayes. Markakis should have easily went to second, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Manny would single later in the at-bat, meaning Nick may have scored if he was on second base instead of first.With men on the corners and one out, Adam Jones struck out not once, but twice in his at-bat, even getting a second chance on a missed call that got Royals Manager Ned Yost tossed from the game. Jones couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lay off anything in the dirt, raise your hand if you have heard that before.Then, after Chris Davis worked a walk to load the bases, Nelson Cruz struck out. Now his at-bat was not as egregious as Jones or Machado, but striking out there is deflating. He just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t catch up to what Greg Holland threw.Manny Machado also had an error in this game. The O\xe2\x80\x99s still lead the majors in defense, but anytime the platinum Gold Glover makes an error, it makes its way onto the bad list.What\xe2\x80\x99s NEXT: The Orioles go for the series win Sunday at 2:10 from Kauffman Stadium. The matchup is a battle of two top pitchers, as Ubaldo Jimenez (2-4, 4.02) and his sterling May statistics take the mound against James Shields (5-3, 2.54). Not exactly the best matchup for two teams struggling to hit, but you never know when you might get one of those surprising games where it looks like a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s duel on paper, but ends up being a slugfest. With both these teams due to break out, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to see it happen.

(AP) \xe2\x80\x94 In the span of just a couple innings, the Baltimore Orioles went from struggling to break up a perfect game to having the winning run on second base with two outs in the ninth inning.They nearly turned a miserable night into a memorable one.Instead, Royals closer Greg Holland rebounded to strike out Nelson Cruz, preserving Kansas City\'s 1-0 victory Saturday night. It also made a winner of Danny Duffy, who had a perfect game going until Adam Jones sent a single up the middle with two outs in the seventh inning.""We found a way to get back in it in the ninth and had the right guys at the plate,"" said Orioles bench coach John Russell, who acted as manager as Buck Showalter attended his daughter\'s graduation. ""We still found a way to make it interesting.""Duffy (2-3) was pulled after another single in the eighth, but the Orioles were unable to build off it against reliever Wade Davis. Holland came in for the ninth and gave up a single and two walks to load the bases for Cruz, who struck out with the game on the line.Bud Norris (2-4) was the hard-luck loser, allowing four hits and a walk in 7 1-3 innings.The lone run he allowed came in the first, when Nori Aoki led off with a single, stole second and then scored on Butler\'s single to center. The hit ended a 0-for-10 slump, and gave Kansas City only its second run in the first three games of the four-game set.""Their guy was pretty tough tonight,"" Norris said. ""It was a tough one to lose. I\'m trying to put up zeroes. That\'s the ultimate goal.""Duffy missed most of last season while recovering from Tommy John surgery, and he began this season in the bullpen after losing the competition for a rotation spot in spring training. But he was forced back into the rotation a few weeks ago, when Bruce Chen landed on the disabled list with a back injury, and has pitched so well that he may have claimed the spot for good.After struggling with control most of his first three seasons, Duffy has finally started to harness his stuff. He allowed one run on two hits in four innings in his first start May 3 against Detroit, and one run on two hits in six innings last week in Seattle.He wound up losing both games when the Royals failed to score a run for him.Perhaps with that in mind, Duffy kept the Orioles off the scoreboard entirely. He never got close to allowing a hit until Caleb Joseph hit a liner at third baseman Mike Moustakas to end the sixth inning, and Alex Gordon made a spectacular diving catch on Nick Markakis\'s flyball to lead off the seventh. Duffy then struck out Manny Machado before Jones delivered his single.""I heard somebody say this is the type for, like, a perfect game,"" said the Orioles\' Caleb Joseph. ""Right after that, somebody said, \'Jonesy is about to rip one right here.\'""Asked whether he took any satisfaction in breaking up the perfect game, Jones replied: ""I don\'t care about all that. I just don\'t want to see it done against my team.""The crowd gave Duffy a standing ovation after the hit, and then another when he exited the game. Duffy sheepishly waved his cap in appreciation as he entered the dugout.""I was just trying to stay calm,"" Duuffy said. ""Mechanics will come through on their own if you trust your stuff, you don\'t overdo anything. And we were on the attack all day.""NOTES: Jones has a 12-game hitting streak. ...

The offense and pitching surprised me and were more than the template needed for success.Chris Tillman pitched a spectacular five-hit complete game, while shutting out the Royals. This is the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 third shutout on the season, first complete game shutout, and Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s first career complete game shutout and second career complete game.With the win, the Orioles now have won two-in-a-row improving their record to 22-18 to maintain a hold on first place ahead of the New York Yankees. The Royals are now below .500 at 20-21.Tillman outpitched Jeremy Guthrie, who had a 2-0 record and 1.89 ERA against the Orioles coming into Friday\xe2\x80\x99s game.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense did just enough with eight hits over eight innings against Guthrie, while scoring four runs. Not enough to give Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans discounted pizza, but enough behind Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s start to bring home the win.Guthrie did limit the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 chances with runners in scoring position as they went 1-for-3.The offense successfully put up four runs, but did leave five men on base throughout the game. Even with the chances missed, four runs is the favorite number for the Orioles.With the 4-0 victory, the Orioles are now 14-4 when they score at least four runs. The Orioles scored four runs in attempted comebacks in three of the four losses.That does leave the Orioles with an 8-14 record in situations when they score less than four runs.When the Orioles can put up four runs in non-comeback situations, the pitching actually works with the offense to have a .933 winning percentage.When analyzing the 14-4 record deeper, later in the season, this stat could become clouded by bad pitching and failed comebacks.The key to focus on is when the offense scores four runs with the lead, the Orioles win. If the offense can maintain some consistency, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching has the track record to play well with the offense.As a fan who watched the Orioles during the bad years, this is a new type of play for them. The pitching had no real consistency, and did not complement the offense.Now, the numbers seem to say this, but I will hold off on saying this is for certain until later in the season. In the meantime, I will analyze the last two seasons to see how true my analysis is.But as of right now, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense needs to go for the number four.Danny Duffy is the next pitcher the offense will have to deal with. The Orioles faced Duffy as a relief pitcher in Baltimore.The Orioles scored one unearned run on Duffy as he only faced three batters. The last time Duffy faced Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 batters was in 2011 with many players no longer on the team.This is the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 chance to take another win away from Duffy, who has much less experience playing against Baltimore.However, that also means the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 batters have not faced Duffy much at all. There are only two players, Delmon Young and Jemile Weeks, who have more than five at-bats against Duffy since 2011.If the offense can reach the magic number of four, according to my numbers, the pitching should lead the Orioles to a win.

After two quick outs in the top of the seventh inning of what could have been developing into a perfect game (or no-hitter), Adam Jones stroked a base hit to center field to give the Baltimore Orioles their first base runner of the night. As all of Birdland exhaled, the faithful at Kaufman Stadium rose to their feet and gave Danny Duffy a standing ovation.Duffy probably pitched the best game of the season league-wide, and it was nice to see the crowd recognize that. I feel that so often we get caught up in wins and losses, and sometimes we don\xe2\x80\x99t take the chance to recognize players who make supreme efforts. It was a similar scene in the top of the eighth inning when manager Ned Yost lifted Duffy and went to the bullpen. As he walked off the field, he doffed his cap to the crowd in appreciation for their support. Class on the part of the fans, as well as the player.The unfortunate victim of Duffy\xe2\x80\x99s game was Bud Norris, who pitched virtually just as well. Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 7.1 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 1 K. Nori Aoki hit an infield single to J.J. Hardy at short to lead off the game, and then he proceeded to steal second base. He scored on Brett Butler\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single which both opened and closed the scoring on the day for both teams.In fairness, Kansas City had some other opportunities to score runs, but they ran themselves out of those opportunities. This was helped by the fact that the Oriole fielders are pretty quick-witted; Cain was thrown out at third base on a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice in the last of the second, and Moustakas had a similar out at third in the seventh. However that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take away from Norris\xe2\x80\x99 effort, as he minimized the damage in the first inning and held Kansas City off the board for the rest of the game.This is the second consecutive game in which Bud Norris has pitched more than good enough toCourtesy of Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sportswin, but the bats couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the job done. So the question that many Orioles fans had in the wake of the game itself was whether or not Duffy was that good or if he simply looked that good because he was facing the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense. I have news for you folks; the Orioles have a good offense. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t playing as well as they could at the moment, however one would be hard-pressed to say that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t potent at the plate.Perhaps a better way of putting it is that they have the potential to be very potent at the plate. Again, they\xe2\x80\x99ve also run into some tough pitching this year. Having said that, Kansas City only mustered four hits against Oriole pitching last night, yet I suspect that there are few questions about their offensive output last night. Yet when the O\xe2\x80\x99s defeated Kansas City 2-1 on Thursday, many people questioned whether or not the Orioles had the bats to compete. It\xe2\x80\x99s very possible that this could be viewed as an \xe2\x80\x9ceast coast vs. middle America\xe2\x80\x9d type of thing \xe2\x80\x93 we tend to scrutinize things much more stringently in this region of the country.The O\xe2\x80\x99s did load the bases in the top of the ninth, however Nelson Cruz struck out to end the game. So despite the struggles at the plate, the Birds did have the go-ahead run(s) on base at the end. On a side note, Kansas City manager Ned Yost was ejected in the ninth inning arguing that Adam Jones had not foul tipped a ball in the dirt (at which he swung on and missed). Replays seemed to back up Yost\xe2\x80\x99s point, as did the fact that Jones appeared to begin walking back to the dugout in the immediate aftermath of the play. I would submit that the league might want to consider making things like that reviewable, however it would be tough to get a conclusive shot on replay of something like that.Ubaldo Jimenez will take to the mound in the series finale this afternoon, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll square off against \xe2\x80\x9cBig Game\xe2\x80\x9d James Shields.

05/20/2014,"[('Series Preview: Baltimore Orioles @ Pittsburgh Pirates, 20 ...', "" It's been an up-and-down May for Orioles fans, but as much as it's been frustrating of late, they're still 10-8 on the month. The last time the O's played the Pirates, the Birds swept a doubleheader. The pitching matchups, though, make a series split look more likely.    Tuesday, 20 May, 7:05 P.M.: Miguel Gonzalez @ Francisco Liriano      Gonzalez Liriano   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 171.1 39.2 161.0 48.2   ERA 3.78 4.76 3.02 4.25   FIP 4.45 4.96 2.92 3.81   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .243/.300/.413 .274/.347/.478 .224/.297/.314 .243/.322/.384      Gonzalez got bumped to the bullpen for one swing through the rotation, but he returns to starting tonight. It was a bit odd, since he was coming off of perhaps his best part of the season, but Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette know a lot more about what's going on than we do. Gonzalez has been a bit unlucky with the home run ball this year (HR/FB: 13.2% vs. 11.1% career), and he's also finally had his previous luck on balls in play normalize (.310 this year vs. .260 in '12 and '13). If there's a silver lining to his struggles, it's that his strikeout rate is significantly higher than in the past (~17% in '12-'13, ~20% in '14), but his walk rate has also risen, so it's a bit of a wash right now. Liriano was outstanding last year, mostly because he managed to get his walk rate under 10% and got a little lucky on flyballs staying in the park. This year, his walk rate's gone up a bit, and he's also had some poor luck with homers. Still, he's a lefty that gets a lot of strikeouts, the O's don't take a lot of walks, and Gonzalez has struggled this year. It's hard to feel good about this matchup. Liriano is basically a sinker-slider guy against lefties, and this year, he's actually thrown sliders more than half of the time against them. Versus righties, he throws a roughly even mix of sinkers, sliders, and changeups.    Maybe hot: Adam Jones (1.133 OPS, 15 PA) Likely not: J.J. Hardy (.516 OPS, 14 PA) Wednesday, 21 May, 7:05 P.M.: Chris Tillman @ Wandy Rodriguez      Tillman Rodriguez   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 206.1 56.2 62.2 25.0   ERA 3.71 3.34 3.59 6.84   FIP 4.42 4.27 4.42 6.99   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .241/.303/.427 .231/.298/.371 .240/.286/.421 .291/.336/.641         Tillman's last start was his first career shutout. It's a nice thing to see from a pitcher who tends to struggle to get deep into games, and even better considering that he walked five batters in the prior start. Whether his success was a real step forward or merely a product of facing a poor offense remains to be seen. Rodriguez's poor numbers this year are rather eye-popping, in particular that .641 SLG against him. Roughly a quarter of flyballs he allows are leaving the yard this year, which is surely an unsustainable rate, though one has to wonder how much of that is luck vs. poor pitching. Rodriguez also is recovering from some injury issues, as he spent a month on the disabled list with a knee injury before coming back to make a start on the 15th. The lefty throws fastballs about sixty percent of the time to all batters, showing more sinkers than four-seamers in previous years but giving lefties more four-seamers in '14. A curveball is his primary offspeed pitch, and it's his go-to out pitch against both righties and lefties, but he'll throw a changeup to righties as well, mostly when he ends up behind in the count.    Maybe hot: J.J. Hardy (.972 OPS, 25 PA) Likely not: Nelson Cruz (.639 OPS, 12 PA)  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: The Rest of the Season Starts Today', 'May 4, 2014; Minneapolis, MN, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Miguel Gonzalez (50) works in the first inning against the Minnesota Twins at Target Field. Mandatory Credit: Brad Rempel-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles need to get a grip on turning around a rough stretch of games and get back into a consistent winning pattern. The opportunity to open up an early season lead over the scuffling rest of the pack in the AL East is lost at this point. The need now is to battle to regain the lead and keep it by determined wins night to night.Yes, the rest of the season starts every day, but the time is now to fix the disjointed pieces of this team and make it work as a cohesive unit. The Orioles have had trouble scoring runs, though the pitching has been much improved since the beginning of the season. And then, just when they break out a bit with six runs (albeit late in the game and when behind), the other team tallies eight.Yes, good teams find a way to win and bad teams find a way to lose. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of each from the Birds of 2014, which is why their record is 22-20. It\xe2\x80\x99s the old half empty / half full thing. In light of the numbers of injuries to key players and the weird schedule, it could be argued that 22-20 is not that bad. Yet the powerful bats and players in this lineup, even missing some of the stars, would seem sufficient to have won a few more of these close games with just a bit more production.The Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 anemic hitting remains a mystery. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say about it. Neither do the beat writers. Everyone is mystified. There has been some good pitching against them, without doubt. Most folks think this lethargic offence is going to change \xe2\x80\xa6 that it can\xe2\x80\x99t stay this way for very long. Adam Jones is hitting homers again, and Manny Machado really does seem to be getting the timing back. J.J. Hardy is getting hits and batting above his historic average with the Orioles. But the Birds really need Chris Davis to get it going; and they need the catching subs for Matt Wieters to produce sufficiently.It is encouraging to see better Orioles pitching. Honestly, Ubaldo Jimenez (in my humble opinion) did better on Sunday than the numbers tell. There were more than a few ground balls hit through the infield \xe2\x80\x93 balls that if hit just a few feet in one direction or the other would be outs or double plays.\xc2\xa0 He did make a mistake on the three-run homer, but overall I continue to believe he has turned a corner since April is gone. In my view, Troy Patton is a good candidate for fresh air elsewhere \xe2\x80\xa6 hopefully in exchange for some helpful piece now or later.Tonight the Baltimore Orioles begin a quick two-day series in Pittsburgh, where the Pirates hope to pay back the Birds for the doubleheader loss just two weeks ago at Oriole Park.Miguel Gonzalez will be making his first career start against the Pirates. Will he be able to go six or more innings? You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to bet on that. Placement is everything for Gonzalez. He enters with a 1-3 record and 4.76 ERA over 39.2 innings of work.Francisco Liriano will take the mound for the Pirates. After a 16-8, 3.02 campaign in 2013, he is currently 0-3 with a 4.25 ERA. He is a bit like his countryman Jimenez \xe2\x80\x93 liking the warm weather, starting slowly, and giving up more walks than ideally desired. Liriano is 2-3 with a 4.21 ERA in seven career starts against the Orioles, the most recent being when with the White Sox in 2012.Against Liriano, Adam Jones is 4-for-15 with three homers, as is Nick Markakis, though without the homers. Delmon Young is 4-for-8 with a homer, and I would speculate that Buck Showalter will see those numbers and wanting to get some at-bats for Young will have him in left field (no DH today!). \xc2\xa0J.J. Hardy is 3-for-14 and Nelson Cruz is 2-for-5. Chris Davis has never faced the lefty.

He grew up in Akron, Ohio; (No, he isn\'t pals with LeBron) the son of Dennis and Denise. I mean, come on! How adorable is that? Dennis (he goes by Denny) worked at a Goodyear plant that built race tires in Akron for forty years. Denise is, and has been for over thirty years, a cashier at a grocery store in town. In high school, Lough was a four sport athlete. He would play football and soccer in the fall, basketball in the winter, and baseball in the spring. His best sport? You guessed it...soccer! The future major leaguer was recruited by numerous division I programs for soccer. It was his passion. However, the family did not have a lot of money and none of these programs were offering enough in terms of scholarships. Smaller schools, like division II Mercyhurst, really liked Lough\'s abilities on the football field and baseball diamond. They offered a full ride if he would play the two sports.    He enrolled and became a business and accounting major. It was quite a different route from his siblings, Damon and Danielle, who both studied science. One became a high school physics and chemistry teacher. The other is a chemical engineer.    In the fall, he was the kicker, punter, wide receiver, and return specialist for the college\'s football team. After practices he would run drills for major league scouts. Sometimes, he would still be wearing his leg pads while taking batting practice or running sprints. In the spring, he was the starting outfielder and part of the ground\'s crew for the Lakers\'\xc2\xa0baseball team. The college baseball season starts in mid-February. In Erie, PA, where Mercyhurst is located, that is right in the heart of winter. Rather than allowing the snow to melt, Lough and his teammates were responsible for clearing off the baseball diamond with shovels, trash cans and anything else they could find.    Following his junior season he was named a third-team All-American and selected by the Royals in the eleventh round of the amateur draft. He signed and left school before finishing his degree. Don\'t worry, he went back in the 2012 off-season and earned a degree in sports marketing. In the minors Lough was never highly regarded. At his peak, Baseball America had him rated as the tenth best prospect in the Royals farm system. As he stewed away and played season after season at Triple-A Omaha his ranking plummeted before getting his first big league call-up in September of 2012. He had a 20 game-long cup of coffee with KC that year, which included a hit in his first career at-bat when he singled off of the Twins\' (and for a short-time an Oriole) Liam Hendriks.    2013 saw him spend the majority of the season with the Royals. It was a campaign in which he hit .286 with 17 doubles. His glove was superb. For that season, FanGraphs gave him a zone rating of 14.5. As a 27 year old rookie, he didn\'t receive much hype but\xc2\xa0did come in eighth place for the American League Rookie of the Year voting. In December of that year, Dan Duquette and the Baltimore Orioles came calling and he was shipped to the east coast in exchange for Danny Valencia and well, you know the rest of the story. Quick Notes  His favorite player as a kid: David Justice He was a fan of all of the Cleveland-area teams growing up Lough is a certified personal trainer His body fat percentage has been well noted; it\'s still 3 percent On cheat days he goes for wings or pizza His favorite movie: Dumb and Dumber He likes Justin Bieber (must\'ve been around Guthrie too much in KC) His favorite superhero: Batman His favorite TV Show: Dexter His favorite cartoon: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  Sources: Mercyhurst Baseball, Mercyhurst Football, CSN Baltimore, The Kansas City Star, Akron Beacon Journal, The CantonRep, MASN and\xc2\xa0Bleacher Report  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsGonzalez went 0-for-3 at the plate last night, however one thing that some people don\xe2\x80\x99t know is that Buck Showalter only has his pitchers practice their bunting for the most part. (Some guys do take some swings in the cage here and there, but their \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d BP is just bunting.)  Oriole pitchers only practice bunting during BP.  That in and of itself would be an argument in favor\xc2\xa0of the DH, in that having a pitcher swing the lumber takes away from the offensive element of the game.But baseball isn\xe2\x80\x99t an offensive game, or a defensive game for that matter. Part of the charm of the sport has always been that it\xe2\x80\x99s a thinking man\xe2\x80\x99s game. The best hitters, pitchers, coaches, etc. are also great thinkers. It\xe2\x80\x99s a game of strategy, and sometimes one of chess. Thus it would stand to reason that American League pitchers, who aren\xe2\x80\x99t as used to hitting as their National League counterparts, would only practice bunting. A ground ball in the infield could start a double play and run the team right out of the inning. So while some would argue that having pitchers almost exclusively bunt is a waste, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually strategic.But perhaps more importantly, the last time I checked pitchers were part of the nine on the field. The question posed should be why\xc2\xa0shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pitchers have to hit? Occasionally we hear pitchers complain about run support; that pitcher would bear some accountability for that if he had to hit.Speaking for myself, it would be tragic if pitchers league-wide didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to swing the lumber. It boils down to the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s a part of the game. Under National League rules, managers have to be much more strategic and think a bit harder when it comes to when to lift a pitcher and so forth. Why should American League managers not have to do the same? Granted, most pitchers aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best hitters in the world. But is that due to the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re pitchers or that they\xe2\x80\x99re in theory only hitting once a week or so?Go figure, on occasion we\xe2\x80\x99ve even seen pitchers that were darned good hitters. Recently, Carlos Zambrano and Dontrelle Willis could hit pretty well. He was a career .238 hitter that actually hit 24 home runs over the course of his career. In fact, his average probably would have been even better had managers not decided to send him up as a pinch hitter from time to time \xe2\x80\x93 he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the greatest pinch hitter in the world. (To compare, Oriole legend Mark Belanger retired with a career .228 average.) The Washington Nationals would also use Livan Hernandez as a pinch hitter from time to time.I understand why teams don\xe2\x80\x99t generally use their pitchers in pinch-hitting roles, however that opens up another point of discussion; what if a team runs out of bench players? Remember in 2012 when the Orioles played a 17 and 18-inning game? Everyone remembers Chris Davis pitching, but what if the inverse had occurred? Let\xe2\x80\x99s say a field player gets injured or ejected, and the team has nobody left on the bench. That should never happen, because there are four other (starting) pitchers on the bench that should be fresh. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be a luxury to be able to summon a starting pitcher to the plate and know that he has a chance at coming through?This is all well and good, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the AL ever getting rid of the designated hitter. In fact, I suspect that at some point the NL\xc2\xa0will adopt it, meaning that we\xe2\x80\x99ll never see pitchers at the plate. But to my real point here, if a player (pitcher or otherwise) is on the 25-man roster he should be able to hit. That\xe2\x80\x99s part of baseball. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Tillman Struggles, Orioles Fall To Pirates 9-8 \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' PITTSBURGH (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Chris Tillman has grown used to the concept of running into early trouble and eventually working his way out of it. The Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 right-hander couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the answer Wednesday night. Tillman retired just three batters as the Orioles fell 9-8 to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s first-inning ERA ballooned to 9.90 after he gave up four to begin the game then followed it up by giving up four more in the second without recording an out. Not exactly the follow-up he was expecting after tossing a shutout in his previous start against Kansas City. \xe2\x80\x9cComing off a good one, you\xe2\x80\x99d like to carry it over and get into rhythm here,\xe2\x80\x9d Tillman said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was tough. I battled and tried to make adjustments, but they just weren\xe2\x80\x99t coming to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Tillman gave up eight runs, six earned, in one-plus inning, walking three and striking out one while his overall ERA sailed from 3.34 to 4.21. \xe2\x80\x9cChris has spoiled us at a high level pitching,\xe2\x80\x9d Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cTonight was just a tough night for him. He\xe2\x80\x99s struggled before early and gotten back in sync and gave us some strong innings, but it just never really came to him tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d Nelson Cruz hit his 14th homer of the season and drove in three runs for the Orioles, who rallied to tie the game at 8 in the top of the seventh before reliever Ryan Webb (2-1) gave it back in the bottom of the inning on Tony Sanchez\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single. Nick Markakis, Chris Davis and JJ Hardy had two hits and one RBI apiece, but Baltimore left 10 men on base as the Orioles failed to sweep their four-game interleague series with the Pirates. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had two early exits from starters and it became a game out of the bullpen and they pushed one across there late,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut our guys, we had a couple opportunities to score some more, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t fault the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d Andrew McCutchen went 3 for 4 with an RBI and his first two extra-base hits in more than two weeks for Pittsburgh, which won for only the third time in its past nine games. Starling Marte and Ike Davis had three hits and two RBIs apiece for the Pirates. Bryan Morris (4-0) earned the victory after failing to protect an 8-6 lead. Mark Melancon worked a perfect ninth for his seventh save. Pittsburgh began the night eight games under .500 in part because of a struggling starting staff that has hardly looked like the group that led the team to the postseason last fall. Things didn\xe2\x80\x99t get much better, but the bullpen briefly recaptured its touch. Reliever Vin Mazzaro\xe2\x80\x99s steady hand out of the bullpen played in stark contrast to the mess made by Pittsburgh starter Wandy Rodriguez. The veteran left-hander has struggled with his command and his conviction all season and did little to convince manager Clint Hurdle he was ready to turn the corner despite being spotted a 4-0 first-inning lead thanks in part to a two-run triple by Marte. The 35-year-old Rodriguez, in the final year of his contract, promptly gave the big lead away as Cruz led off the second with a blistering solo home run and added a two-run double later in the inning to put the Orioles in front. Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s throwing error on a sacrifice bunt attempt by Tillman meant he was only charged with one earned run for his 1 2-3 innings of work, dropping his ERA from 6.84 to 6.75. Tillman couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of the reprieve. Marte\xe2\x80\x99s two-run triple highlighted Pittsburgh\xe2\x80\x99s outburst in the first. Things got no better after Tillman watched his teammates erupt off Rodriguez. Tillman failed to retire a batter in the second as the first six Pittsburgh batters reached base. Brad Brach came on in relief to get out of the inning, but not until after the Orioles trailed 8-6. NOTES: Pirates closer Jason Grilli could return as early as Saturday. Grilli has been on the disabled list since sustaining a left oblique strain on April 20.

05/22/2014,"[(""Baltimore Orioles' Pitching Compliments Offense When ..."", 'Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are no different from any other MLB team when it comes to winning games when scoring at least four runs.I have been digging into the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 seasons since 2011 to understand this stat when it comes to Baltimore.Through the first month and a half, the Orioles are playing very similar to their 2012 season, also known as the playoff season.Underneath all of the numbers, the Orioles season come down to the same things, and the small differences show the results of each season.In regards to scoring four runs, the Orioles were 58-39 for a .597 winning percentage in 2011. When removing failed comebacks which resulted in the Orioles scoring four runs, their record was 58-24 with a .707 winning percentage.Within the 58 wins, 35 wins came when the opponents scored less than four times. The other 23 wins came when the opponents scored four or more times.A key factor in that season was a 23-39 record when the Orioles scored four or more runs and allowed four or more runs. Even when removing failed comebacks, the Orioles still had a losing record.In 2012, the Orioles won 93 games and 72 of those games the offense scored four or more runs. Their overall record when scoring at least four runs was 72-17 for a .809 winning percentage.Analyzing each loss, eight of those games the Orioles scored four runs in a failed comeback. A 72-9 record is left with a .889 winning percentage.The Orioles scored four or more runs 46 times, while the pitching held the opponents to less than four runs. 26 times the opposing team scored four or more runs.The Orioles were 26-9 (excluding failed comebacks) in 2012 when both teams scored four or more runs.In contrast to the 2011 season, the Orioles pitching complemented the offense. The pitching was better compared to previous years giving the Orioles 21 wins when the offense scored less than four runs.A similar trend could be seen in the 2013 season, but with some differences.The Orioles, again like all MLB teams do, won 69 of 85 games when scoring four or more runs. However, that season the pitching was not as good as in 2012, so the Orioles lost 31 times when scoring four or more times.The Orioles won 24 times when they scored four or more, giving them a .436 winning percentage in that scenario. When accounting for failed comebacks, which often distort this stat, the winning percentage raises only to .558%.The overall record dropped from 2012 to .690 winning percentage when scoring four or more runs, or .784% when removing the distortion from the stats.The pitching\xe2\x80\x99s poor performance showed when both teams scored less than four runs, which stood at 16-14 for a .533 winning percentage.With all those stats of the recent seasons, the only stats that matter are the ones for this 2014 season.Through the first month and a half of the season, the Orioles are on the same track record of the last two seasons.The offense has currently scored four or more runs in 21 games, winning 15. Four of the six losses only come into this stat because of failed comebacks.The Orioles have lost two times when the offense has kept the game in reach. The pitching was just bad enough for good offense to be unable to overcome.In my analysis of the past three seasons and this current season, I put the blame on the offense, and not as much on the pitching.Before a revolt breaks out at this blasphemy, there is reasoning behind this madness. The Orioles offense has been good with the massive onslaught of home runs last season, and a powerhouse of a lineup.I take this from the record the Orioles have when both teams score four or more runs. The pitching keeps the Orioles in the games, but the offense leaves them hanging, which leads to a loss.The pitching is to blame for some games, such as Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 9-8 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates.However, this season, the offense has not been consistent to provide a complementary aspect to the pitching.When offense scores the magic number of four, the pitching complements it with a good outing, or keeps the Orioles in the game, most of the time. This has been true for the most part over the past two winning seasons.The Orioles have never been a great pitching team, and now that there has been an improvement, it is time for the offense to step up.If the offense can be a bit more consistent, the Orioles are going to start push away from the .500 mark, and become a better team.The lineup has the players to do it, but the consistency has not shown up yet this season. I am still waiting for the Orioles to take advantage of their magic number of four. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: A look at the bench - Birds Watcher', 'Getting your\xc2\xa0bench players frequent at-bats is a problem every major league manager struggles with over the course of a season, especially in the American League. The Orioles have several proven major league hitters on their bench, but with the position players relatively healthy at the moment, Showalter has struggled to find them consistent playing time. Too many quality players is a good problem to have, but major league hitters need at-bats to keep their timing and be productive when called upon.Although he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shown anything at the plate this season, Ryan Flaherty has shown flashes of above-average power over the previous two seasons. However, with the immergence of Jonathan Schoop, Flaherty has only seen action in five games this month. Part of his absence is probably a result of his lack of production so far this season, but significant time between ABs isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to help his swing when he has to play. If the Orioles want to keep him on the active roster, they are going to have to find him at least some ABs.Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s greatest asset is that he can play virtually every position. As the Orioles have seen thus far this season, J.J. Hardy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the power-hitter they had seen in the past. Coming off an April where he was hampered by nagging injuries, the 31 year old slugger may benefit from more frequent off days. Giving Flaherty some starts at short could keep Hardy fresh in August and September.The most difficult issue on the bench may be Delmon Young and Steve Pearce. Both have shown the ability to hit at the major league level in the past and both were productive early in the season. However, the issue in finding them playing time is their similarities. Both get the majority of playing time against lefties and both play similar positions. However, the advantage would have to go to Pearce because he can play first base as well as the corner outfield positions.As Orioles fans saw in Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 absence, Pearce can be a productive hitter when given the opportunity. Although it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to sit some of our best hitters, guys like Davis and Markakis could also benefit from more frequent off days. The Orioles could even start Pearce in left, slide David Lough to center and allow Adam Jones an off day. The Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t losing too much at the plate with Pearce, and it would keep him sharp and others rested as the season goes on.Delmon Young may be the odd man out. Young hit over .300 for the Orioles in April, however he has only 10 Abs since May 7th. With the way the roster is right now, the Orioles may\xc2\xa0gain more from a player like Jemile Weeks or Steve Lombardozzi in that final roster spot. However, if the Orioles choose to go in that direction, they would probably lose Young to another team.The Orioles had five players play more than 150 games last year, more than any other team. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say if that contributed to the less than stellar September, but one could argue other teams may have had fresher legs down the stretch. With quality talent behind them, the Orioles should consider doing more to keep their stars rested for a stretch run. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
05/23/2014,"[(""Orioles and Indians play sloppiest game in history, O's ..."", "" The Orioles and Indians engaged in a back-and-forth game tonight that can only be described as ridiculous. Both teams had plenty of chances to score, both teams had multiple misplays in the field. No matter which team had won, the other team would have left the field feeling like garbage. In this case, the garbage team was the Orioles.    If you take a glance at Wei-Yin Chen's pitching line (6 2/3, 8 H, 5 R, 0 BB, 1 K, 1 HR), you would probably think he pitched worse than he did. He did get into some trouble in the second and third innings, giving up a solo home run to Ryan Raburn and then allowing two more to come in on a single, a triple, and a wild pitch. But then he buttoned down and went into the seventh inning looking good. The Orioles had gotten him a two-run lead by that time. He gave up a one-out single, then 2B Ryan Flaherty botched not one, but two double play balls to keep the inning going. It pushed Chen into his danger zone pitch count, and he gave up a two-run single. Shame. Chen deserved better tonight. Justin Masterson was good for the first four innings of the game tonight, even though it was so long ago that I barely remember it. But he started the fifth inning by walking Steve Clevenger on four pitches and then hitting J.J. Hardy and Ryan Flaherty. That brought David Lough to the plate, who grounded into a 1-2-3 double play. Seriously. Masterson wasn't so lucky in the next inning, when he gave up a double, a walk, and two singles that resulted in two Orioles runs. He then, embarrassingly, gave up a three-run home run to Ryan Flaherty, temporarily giving the Orioles a two-run lead. Masterson was pulled from the game after walking David Lough.    We didn't even have time to bask in the glory of Flaherty's Earl Weaver Special before he was making us hate him via the shenanigans mentioned above. First he stepped directly in front of Hardy, who was about to field an easy ground ball for a double play, and then he dropped a ground ball right to him that would have been another double play. Brian Matusz had to replace Chen at that point, and after giving up a single, Asdrubal Cabrera hit a fly ball that looked for sure like a three-run homer. But David Lough proved that he does have some worth after all, with a\xc2\xa0fantastic catch to end the inning.    The Indians wanted to get in on the shenanigans, and made two fielding errors in the bottom of the seventh inning to set up a go-ahead sac fly by Nelson Cruz. That lead lasted about five seconds, because Darren O'Day gave up a home run in the 8th to Lonnie Chisenhall. No more runs were scored until the 13th inning, thanks in part to more Orioles shenanigans. These shenanigans included Flaherty striking out because he bunted with two strikes and it went foul, and Steve Clevenger bunting to move Nelson Cruz over, only to have Cruz thrown out at second.    Preston Guilmet pitched 2 1/3 great innings, and if the Orioles had won this game he would have been a prime candidate for MBP. But eventually he had to give way to someone, and that someone was Troy Patton. Here is a quick summary of what Patton did:  Here is what he actually did:  Pitching Change: Troy Patton replaces Preston Guilmet.  2.Michael Brantley singles on a soft line drive to center fielder Adam Jones.  3.Lonnie Chisenhall singles on a bunt line drive to second baseman Jonathan Schoop. Michael Brantley to 2nd.  4.Nick Swisher walks. Michael Brantley to 3rd. Lonnie Chisenhall to 2nd. Coaching visit to mound.  5.Yan Gomes flies out to right fielder Nick Markakis in foul territory.  6.Carlos Santana doubles (6) on a ground ball to left fielder Steve Pearce. Michael Brantley scores. Lonnie Chisenhall scores. Nick Swisher to 3rd.  7.David Murphy walks.  8.Mike Aviles grounds into a force out, third baseman Ryan Flaherty to second baseman Jonathan Schoop. David Murphy out at 2nd.  The Orioles may have to get rid of a relief pitcher to have someone fresh tomorrow. It will probably be Preston Guilmet, but I pretty much hope that it's Troy Patton. Nick Markakis, after watching strike three in the bottom of the 10th and leaving five men on base over the course of the game, decided it was time for an FUHR in the bottom of the 13th. Some might say that it's not an FUHR in a two-run game, but trust me, it was.    Oh, and on top of it all, Manny Machado came out of the game with a groin injury. Tune in tomorrow for another Orioles game, if you can stomach it.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles lost, then won, then lost, then won, and finally lost an ugly game for the ages. Troy Patton was the final loser in the 13th inning \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c giving up a bases-loaded, two-strike double to a batter with a .150 average.The blow by blow of this one is too tedious to repeat. If you saw it, you don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t want to hear about it again. And if you missed it, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll spare you the worst of it.For example, after the Orioles came back from a 3-0 deficit to take a 5-3 lead, it was immediately given back with lousy defense. Then, Lonnie Chisenhall broke that tie to put the Indians ahead with a homer over the right field wall off Darren O\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2Day. Later, with the game tied in the 13th, the same Chisehall set up the inning with a bunt single over the head of a charging Chris Davis. Yes, you read that correctly. It was that kind of game.I want to be annoyed with Ryan Flaherty for misplaying two consecutive balls and costing Chen and the Orioles two runs (and probably the game), but Flash hit a three-run homer to give them the lead that he gave back before the inning was over.And I want to be annoyed with David Lough for grounding into a 1-2-3 double play with the bases loaded and none out, but Lough would save the Orioles three runs with a great catch at the wall.Though the Orioles got great pitching from Zach Britton and Preston Guilmet, it was the totally lost hangers by Patton that killed them, along with Flaherty\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s muffs. I said it before; it is time for fresh air in another place for Patton. And it is difficult to imagine how Delmon Young could not stumble into far better production than comes from Lough \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c who has been a huge disappointment.More good news \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Manny Machado was taken out with some sort of groin aggravation. That seems to be a theme right now, including Chris Tillman and Tommy Hunter \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c now on the DL.This was a game that should not have been lost. The Baltimore Orioles ended up dropping it to what is far, far from a good team, especially in the field. This is not winning baseball.Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s turn the calendar before I say something worse. On Friday \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa6The Indians will start T.J.

', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('5/23: Birds Watcher- Unlucky 13 for the Baltimore Orioles', '13 is considered an unlucky number in our culture. First and foremost for the Baltimore Orioles, their #13 (Manny Machado) left last night\xe2\x80\x99s game against Cleveland with a groin injury. Machado said it tightened up on him as he slid into a base early in the game, however his hope is to be in the lineup tonight.  According to Machado this injury was the first of it\xe2\x80\x99s kind in his career. However this game was also the second consecutive win for Cleveland \xc2\xa0in 13 innings. They defeated (and swept) Detroit at home on Wednesday afternoon on a walk off balk with the bases loaded, and then won 8-7 last night in Baltimore in the 13th. Let\xe2\x80\x99s be frank; luck has nothing to do with it for the most part. Cleveland made the plays they needed to make, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re the Baltimore Orioles, you can\xe2\x80\x99t help but see some strange things in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game.Wei-Yin Chen gave up three runs early, but pitched well enough to win the game without a doubt. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.2 IP, 8 H, 5 R, 0 BB, 1 K. The O\xe2\x80\x99s really had an advantage coming in given that Cleveland was starting Justin Masterson on three days rest, and the Cleveland bullpen was spent after it being emptied the day before. Yet Masterson kept the O\xe2\x80\x99s off the board until the last of the sixth. Adam Jones hit a one-out double and then went to third on a wild pitch. Jones would score on Steve Clevenger\xe2\x80\x98s\xc2\xa0RBI-single (following a Cruz walk), and Cruz would score on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single.The O\xe2\x80\x99s trailed 3-2, and it appeared that Masterson was recalling the fact that he was going on short rest. If that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true previously, it certainly was after Ryan Flaherty gave the OriolesCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportsa 5-3 lead a moment after Hardy got on base with a home run onto the flag court in right field. However again, some things happened that kind of defied logic. An inning later Ryan Flaherty bobbled two balls in the infield on what appeared to be routine plays, which allowed Cleveland to tie the score at five. Neither play was ruled an error, however from my vantage point they appeared to be routine. For the most part Flaherty is a plus defender, but last night it was his prowess at the plate and a few defensive miscues that led the way.In the last of the seventh it was Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s turn to give back in terms of defensive mistakes. Astrubal Cabrera committed an error in the field that allowed Manny Machado to reach base, and a moment later Carlos Santana\xe2\x80\x98s throwing error got Adam Jones on board. Cleveland intentionally loaded the bases, and Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x98s sacrifice fly gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 6-5 lead. Yet Cleveland wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going away; in the top of the eighth Ronny Chisenhall\xe2\x80\x99s pinch-hit solo homer tied the game at six once again.  Be it errors or keeping up on the scoreboard, Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s attitude seemed to be\xc2\xa0anything you can do we can do better. Again, the Orioles should have had an advantage in extra innings as they faced a tired Cleveland bullpen. However they appeared ready for everything the Orioles did. Granted the O\xe2\x80\x99s did muster a few base runners in extras, the following at-bat would end in a double-play or something to that effect. Following a Brantley single with one out in the \xe2\x80\x9cunlucky 13th,\xe2\x80\x9d Cleveland seemed to defy logic. Chisenhall attempted to drag a bunt down the first base line, but instead it came off the bat as a line drive bunt. It sailed past first baseman Chris Davis for a base hit. Conventional wisdom says to keep the ball out of the air on a bunt \xe2\x80\x93 but yet it worked.Carlos Santana\xe2\x80\x99s two-RBI double a few minutes later gave Cleveland an 8-6 lead. The O\xe2\x80\x99s made a comeback attempt in the last of the inning with a Nick Markakis solo homer, however it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t meant to be. You can point to a lot of opportunities lost in this game, however specifically I would mention that the O\xe2\x80\x99s had the bases loaded in the fifth with nobody down and managed not to score. Steve Clevenger drew a walk, and J.J. Hardy and Ryan Flaherty were hit by pitches. David Lough attempted a squeeze bunt, however the ball bumbled right back to the pitcher Masterson, who threw home for a force out to start a 1-2-3 double-play. Nick Markakis followed that with a line drive out, and the Orioles got nothing out of a golden scoring opportunity.While Cleveland was only 2-for-9 with runners in scoring position, the Orioles were 3-for-12. As I said, there\xe2\x80\x99s very little luck involved in this victory from Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s perspective (although that bunt in the 13th inning defies logic). They just made the plays when they needed to do so. The Orioles will now wait to see how badly Manny Machado is injured with his groin. The hope is that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t miss any significant time. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will potentially have to make another roster move before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game given the fact that the bullpen is now somewhat spent.The question is who goes down \xe2\x80\x93 however it\xe2\x80\x99s worth stating that Chris Davis is going to be going on the paternity list in a few days to attend the birth of his first child. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expected until Sunday, but obviously that type of thing is out of our hands. So might that be the corresponding move? Bud Norris will take the mound in tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s T.J. House. Again while luck has little to do with most wins and losses, my recommendation to the Baltimore Orioles would be to try to get things done before the 13th inning tonight. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
05/24/2014,"[('Very Average Baltimore Orioles Clobbered by Indians', 'May 24, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; General view of the scoreboard after the Cleveland Indians shut out the Baltimore Orioles at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Indians defeated the Orioles 9-0. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are an average to slightly-above-average baseball team. As currently constructed and particularly as currently playing, this is a painful truth. And what is their record for the season? 24-23. Yep.There are a lot of explanations and justifications for this, most of which are legitimate; but they don\xe2\x80\x99t change the reality of the opening statement above.But the deal is this: the hopes were that the 2014 Baltimore Orioles could be a lot better than average and would be good enough to compete at the highest levels. And that is still possible in this season of quantum change in the AL East where TORONTO IS IN FIRST PLACE!It is all very, very weird.And the weirdness continued on Saturday afternoon with a 9-0 loss to the Cleveland Indians. Though the Orioles tallied eight base hits, they were sufficiently scattered to never really be a threat to score and get back into the game.Ubaldo Jimenez had another very poor outing. Though he held the Indians off the scoreboard for the first four innings, he had the characteristic elevated pitch count again, eventually giving up five walks. He was unable to get a single out in the fifth inning, as five consecutive batters reached base. Reliever T.J. McFarland was no better on this day, as two more reached and the Indians tallied five in that fifth inning. All those runs would be charged to the account of Jimenez, while four more Cleveland runs in the seventh inning would be credited to McFarland.So What Is The Problem?It is not a simple answer or a single issue. We could sum in up with three \xe2\x80\x9cins\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa61. InjuriesThough the Baltimore Orioles are far from alone in this category, they have indeed been affected negatively by the loss of a number of key players.We knew that Manny Machado would not really be replaced until he returned, and though he has brought back with him the great defense, not surprisingly his hitting and timing has been inconsistent at best.It has often been speculated as to what the cost in performance of the team would be if the Orioles did not have Matt Wieters. We may be finding that out right now, and we may be finding it out for a long time to come if this situation turns into a Tommy John surgery. Though Steve Clevenger and Caleb Joseph have provided very solid catching, their offensive production seriously pales in comparison to the wonderful start on the season that Wieters had put together at the plate. It is a shame that this injury has come at such a time.Chris Davis had his turn on the DL, though he looks to be returning to better form. J.J. Hardy avoided the DL, though he missed a good bit of time earlier in the year. And now Tommy Hunter is on the list.Again, everybody deals with this, though it was thought that the Baltimore Orioles had more depth built into the system to deal with this better than has been the reality. It is one thing to have Ryan Flaherty, Jonathan Schoop, and Clevenger or Joseph in the eighth and ninth holes with a performing lineup one through seven; but when too many pieces are missing or underperforming, the order loses a lot of its teeth.2. Inconsistent PlayIt has so often seemed that when the Orioles hit will, the pitching struggles; or just about the time the Birds get a one-run, seven-inning start, the offense puts up nothing. The Orioles actually have the second highest batting average in the American League, along with the third most hits. Their pitching statistics are also, in the big picture of things, right around the league average. For example, they have given up 4.30 runs-per-game, whereas the AL average is 4.33.One would expect a bit better overall record given the paragraph above, though again, the pitching and hitting has not been in concert on so many occasions.Also, there is the issue of the home/away record. They are 10-12 at home and 14-11 on the road. When have we ever seen this sort of disparity with the Orioles?3. Insufficient PerformanceWe don\xe2\x80\x99t need to look much beyond today to see insufficiency in performance. Ubaldo Jimenez has so far this season evidenced the validity of the reticence of the Orioles management to give large free agent contracts to pitchers. A record of 2-6 and 4.98 ERA is not what the Birds thought they were buying.David Lough has been a bust in left field, especially after looking so good in spring training. I cannot understand this, as there was every reason to believe he would really thrive in Baltimore.Also, the second base and utility infield production has not been what was anticipated and hoped for coming out of the spring.And everyone knew the starting pitching was somewhat likely to struggle with getting deep into games. This has been a mixed bag of performance, and just when it has seemed that perhaps a corner has been turned on this, we have the recent outings of Jimenez today and Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s recent one-inning start.Adam Jones has truly come alive at bat, Nick Markakis has answered many critics with his .300 average, and where would the Orioles be without Nelson Cruz? But this has not been enough.So, all in all, the bad news is that the Orioles are only a game over .500 at this point, though the good news is that the Blue Jays are the only team ahead of them, the Yankees have had an equal struggle, and the Red Sox and Rays are dredging the basement. It is not a lost cause, but this squad with all its talent needs to be better than slightly above average.

It hit off the roof of the grounds crew shed and bounced into the stands\xe2\x80\xa6for a two-run homer. You know that it\xe2\x80\x99s not your day when your opponents are using the dimensions of\xc2\xa0your\xc2\xa0home park to their advantage. However let\xe2\x80\x99s not pin this entirely on Ubaldo Jimenez or the pitching staff. The O\xe2\x80\x99s couldn\xe2\x80\x99t muster any runs off of eight hits.Part of this was due to Corey Kluber\xe2\x80\x98s mastery on the mound.  Many people will question whether Kluber was good on this day, or if the Orioles were just impatient. Either way, he dominated a very potent lineup.  When the O\xe2\x80\x99s did get on base, they were unable to move runners over, or even go station-to-station. Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to explain how the O\xe2\x80\x99s can look so good one day and so off the next. But that\xe2\x80\x99s baseball. Lonnie Chisenhall has also killed Oriole pitching this series, going 2-for-5 with an RBI in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game.For the most part, these four-game series\xe2\x80\x99 end up getting split, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s have a shot at doing that today. Unfortunately they\xe2\x80\x99ll face Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s Trevor Bauer in the finale this afternoon, along with his 2.25 ERA on the season. However the Orioles also pulled quite a few of their starters in the later innings yesterday so as to give them some extra rest with the game out of hand. The Birds will send Miguel Gonzalez to the mound against Cleveland this afternoon.The big news of the day however was that the Orioles announced right as the game was beginning that they had made a trade. Troy Patton was sent to the San Diego Padres (along with cash) in exchange for catcher Nick Hundley. Hundley has had some injury problems over time, however he\xe2\x80\x99s a veteran catcher that handles pitching staffs well. Thus far in 2014, Hundley has been hitting .271 with a homer and three RBI for San Diego. He\xe2\x80\x99s making $4 million this year, and his contract includes a $5 million team option for 2015.This move calls to question what Oriole batteries will look like moving forward this year. This is just my personal opinion, however I suspect that Matt Wieters might not return in 2014. While Wieters still maintains that he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to rejoin the team later in the summer, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the Orioles would make a move like this only to have Wieters come back into the mix. Nevertheless, Caleb Joseph will probably be optioned back to the minor leagues so as to make room for Hundley at some point. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether he\xe2\x80\x99ll actually be in Baltimore for today\xe2\x80\x99s game, or if he\xe2\x80\x99ll join the team in Milwaukee on Monday.As for Troy Patton, he was aquired in a 2007 trade that sent Miguel Tejada to Houston. The Orioles more than got their money\xe2\x80\x99s worth out of him in that sense. Perhaps one of the most important but yet unspoken aspects of this trade from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint is that they\xe2\x80\x99re removing a player from the organization that\xe2\x80\x99s out of options. The bullpen has been a crowded place for some time, and Patton has almost been one of the \xe2\x80\x9cuntouchables\xe2\x80\x9d given that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t send him down without him clearing waivers. That would risk them losing him \xe2\x80\x93 and continuing to pay his salary.So it\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see what roster moves are made in the time between now and this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game given that things seem to be moving fairly\xc2\xa0quickly. Hundley is expected to be\xc2\xa0on the active roster in time for today\xe2\x80\x99s game. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles celebrate birth of baby Davis with 4-2 victory ...', ' Most days, Steve Pearce hangs out on the end of the bench for the Orioles. You sometimes have to wonder if Buck even remembers he is on the team as he stays on the bench behind someone like Delmon Young. Then he gets his chances, like on Sunday, with Chris Davis missing the game to be with his wife as she has their first child. Pearce made the most of his chance, turning in a 3-4 day as the Orioles beat the Indians 4-2, salvaging a split in the series.    The game did not begin with such glory looking apparent. The top of the first inning looked like some kind of continuation of yesterday afternoon\'s mess. Orioles starter Miguel Gonzalez allowed the first three batters of the game to reach without recording an out, and you had to worry if he was about to turn in a dud outing one day after an ugly 9-0 shutout. Runs scored on two consecutive sacrifice flies, one by Lonnie Chisenhall and one by the Governor of Brohio, Nick Swisher. The Indians took a 2-0 lead and did not score for the rest of the game. The O\'s hitters faced off against Indians starter Trevor Bauer, the one-time Diamondbacks prospect who was traded because he wasn\'t Diamondbacks enough for them or whatever. In the MASN broadcast booth, Gary Thorne and Jim Palmer addressed this briefly. Apparently, Bauer is an introvert and rubbed the organization the wrong way. ""There\'s nothing wrong with being an introvert,"" Gary intoned, ""but there is something wrong with being a robot."" Palmer chimed in, ""Unless it\'s cleaning your floor while you\'re away."" Thanks for clearing that up, guys.    As for the actual person Bauer who was on the mound today, he showed flashes of good stuff, striking out eight Orioles batters, but he missed enough that they caught up to him for four runs on six hits in 4.1 innings.    Pearce led off the bottom of the second inning with a single, the first O\'s hit of the game. He stole second as J.J. Hardy struck out. Pearce stealing bases, why not? The stolen base proved important when he scored on a Jonathan Schoop single to put the O\'s on the board. It was Pearce who helped the Orioles pull the score to a 2-2 tie. Nelson Cruz stood on second after a two-out double and Pearce grounded a single into shallow right. The windmill that is Bobby Dickerson never wavered in sending Cruz on the play. He should have been out by a mile, and would have been if Indians catcher Carlos Santana\'s swipe tag into Cruz\'s chest didn\'t end up with the ball falling out. Pearce moved up to second on the throw, but Hardy struck out to end the inning.    The bats were quiet until the fifth inning. Machado led off with a home run that just barely cleared the out-of-town scoreboard, his second homer of the season. He also had two walks on the day. After Adam Jones struck out, Cruz followed with a home run into the Orioles bullpen, his 16th in the Orioles 48th game. One home run for every three team games would end you up with 54 over a 162 game season. That will do. Many people celebrate the birth of a child by smoking cigars. The O\'s hitters celebrated the coming birth of the baby Davis by hitting a couple of home runs. Isn\'t that a unique way to mark the occasion? It\'s amazing to look at Cruz\'s performance so far this season after what he endured on the free agent market. He was sitting there and anyone could have signed him for only a draft pick. Even after it became apparent that he would be settling for a one-year deal, someone could have had him. The Orioles got him for $8 million. Has anyone ever spent $8 million better? Maybe if you got in to Apple or Google on day one. I guess. Your stock portfolio isn\'t winning the Orioles any baseball games.    Anyway, the Orioles had a 4-2 lead after the pair of homers and that was all for Bauer on the day. Pearce greeted new pitcher Mark Lowe with a ground rule double to left center. Hardy added a single, but they would not get another run out of the remainder of that rally. They did not need one. While all this was going on, Gonzalez navigated his way through six innings. He only gave up four hits, but also surrendered four walks and hit a batter. That\'s a lot of runners for six innings, but after the first inning, the Indians only advanced a runner beyond first base one time. That\'s really too bad. The O\'s turned to the bullpen for the final three innings, getting a scoreless inning each from Preston Guilmet, Brian Matusz, and Zach Britton, who only allowed two runners to reach between the three of them. Guilmet went to 3-ball counts on his first two hitters, ending up with a one-out walk to ninth hitter Justin Sellers. He responded by striking out the next two batters to get out of the inning. Not bad for a guy who spent yesterday in roster limbo. As Britton plowed through the Indians lineup in the ninth for his second save, the only tense moment came when Britton fielded a Baltimore chop and fired to first base to retire pinch hitter Ryan Raburn. After he fired the throw to first, he looked to be wincing. The trainer came out to check on him. He remained in the game, not even having to throw any warm-up tosses. Whatever it was, he was fine. With two outs, Britton had to face Sellers, who had basically no chance against 96-97mph sinkers. Sellers struck out looking and the game was in the books.    The win was only the second Sunday victory for the O\'s on the season, and it brought their record in day games up to an abysmal 6-12. Still, a win is a win. They are now 25-23 on the season and sit in third place in the division, 2.5 games back of the division-leading Blue Jays. They now head off to face NL Central-leading Milwaukee, against whom they will hopefully perform better than they have against the AL Central. Game one of the series is Monday afternoon, starting at 2:10 Eastern. The enigma that is Chris Tillman starts the game for the O\'s, with Kyle Lohse taking the ball for the Brewers.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have often had a pattern over the past 10-20 years of losing an unusual majority of Sunday games. It was almost like some sort of religious quirk about playing on Sunday!But yesterday the Orioles put together a very fine all-around game and defeated the Indians 4-2.A criticism of the Baltimore Orioles of 2014 has been about inconsistent play and not putting together the pitching and hitting at the same time. So the flow of the game on Sunday was especially encouraging to O\xe2\x80\x99s fans \xe2\x80\xa6 to see fairly solid pitching supported by some critical hits and aggressive base running, etc.Miguel Gonzalez will never be a dominant pitcher, but he has some very plus pitches when they are working well and he is commanding the ball on the edges of the plate. He needs the catcher to frame pitches well and to get into a rhythm with the umpire\xe2\x80\x99s strike zone du jour. On the latter point, even Buck Showalter commented after the game that there was an \xe2\x80\x9cinteresting strike zone today.\xe2\x80\x9d It did float around a bit. Nick Markakis surely drove home fuming about the random strike zone and being rung up a couple of times on sketchy calls.But Gonzalez settled down after allowing two first-inning runs, pitching six innings and giving up only four hits, though he would walk four and hit a batter.Some very nice and aggressive base running by Steve Pearce and Nelson Cruz helped the Orioles claw out two tying runs, setting up game-winning home runs in the fifth inning by Manny Machado and Cruz (his 16th). Pearce had three hits on the day and is now batting .333.The bullpen contribution of an inning each from Preston Guilmet, Brian Matusz, and Zach Britton only allowed one hit (in the eighth inning) and preserved the victory. Britton was especially sharp and took to the mound with an aggressive \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in your face and coming after you\xe2\x80\x9d demeanor that was great to see. Has anyone else EVER seen a 97-mph sinker like he is throwing right now?TRADE \xe2\x80\x93 Patton for HundleyThe Baltimore Orioles secured the services of a veteran catcher over the weekend by trading reliever Troy Patton for Nick Hundley. I certainly applaud this move. Patton was a nice piece in the bullpen and has been worth his salt over multiple years since coming to the O\xe2\x80\x99s for Miguel Tejada. But \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d has happened off the field, while his \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d on the mound has been marginal. He was not as effective in 2013 and has had several very rough recent outings where there was nothing deceptive about his pitching. The off-field issue and suspension was not helpful, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wondered if he fits well in this clubhouse with what he presents as an aloof personality \xe2\x80\xa6 and I could be entirely wrong on that final point.There is no doubt from remarks by former Padres teammates Brad Brach and Evan Meek that Hundley will fit well on this team. They describe him as a strong people person and a very \xe2\x80\x9cintense\xe2\x80\x9d player \xe2\x80\x93 gotta like hearing that.He is currently hitting .271, though again, this is not a selection to provide offensive punch. He did hit .288 in 82 games in 2011. His career average is .238 over a total of 510 games. And he does have some power potential that may play better in Baltimore than in San Diego.Does this move tip off a belief (either known or feared) that Matt Wieters is headed for ligament surgery? Dan Duquette is the ultimate poker face about such things, but I really do not think on this occasion that a certain loss is pending. It is simply that the percentage chance of that is sufficiently high enough to seek out greater catching depth.Monday\xe2\x80\x99s Memorial Day GameThe Baltimore Orioles find themselves today in Milwaukee to open a 10-game road trip. The rare nature of playing the Brewers was simply brought home to me in the previous sentence where I had to check my accuracy of spelling \xe2\x80\x9cMilwaukee.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0It is something I don\xe2\x80\x99t do or write about \xe2\x80\x93 never been there, and when do the Orioles ever play these guys? Apparently not since 2008.The Birds will be facing a very tough customer in Kyle Lohse who is 6-1 over his 10 starts with an ERA of 2.67 and WHIP of 1.05.\xc2\xa0 He has already thrown 67.1 innings this year; he gives up something in every start, though never very much. His history against the Orioles is with his original team, the Twins, and is now a decade old and largely irrelevant.The Orioles will send either Jekyll or Hyde to pitch today. Will it be the Chris Tillman of the three-hit complete-game shutout, or the person who could not get more than three outs in his most recent start? He does not have to be the former, though the Orioles cannot bear the latter. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if God even knows which one will show up!\xc2\xa0 Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m not uncertain about that, though it seemed like a good sentence for this paragraph.Game time is 2:10.

Mandatory Credit: Benny Sieu-USA TODAY SportsNew Baltimore Orioles catcher Nick Hundley\xe2\x80\x99s first hit for the Birds was a game-winning single in the tenth inning against the Milwaukee Brewers.Over the past week, the Baltimore Orioles played a couple of the worst games seen in recent memory by a Baltimore team. But on this Memorial Day in Milwaukee, they played one that will be long remembered as a great game for the entire team.Chris Tillman again had another very difficult start by giving up six runs in 5.1 innings. With a 6-3 deficit going to the seventh inning, Jonathan Schoop hit a solo homer to cut the margin to 6-4. Two innings later with that same score, and with two outs in the ninth and the Brewers fans standing for the final out, Schoop did it again off Francisco Rodriguez. Now 6-5 and still down to their final swing, Delmon Young drove a pinch-hit single into left field and was immediately replaced on first base with David Lough. Nick Markakis powered a mega-clutch double into left-center field scoring Lough to tie the game.In the bottom of the ninth, Nick Hundley took a shot at being the goat rather than a hero. With a runner at first and one out, on a bunted ball in front of the plate he threw the ball down the right-field line, putting runners at second and third with one out. Ex-Oriole Mark Reynolds came to bat against Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day with a drawn-in infield; and he hits a screamer to J.J. Hardy who doubles the runner off third! Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s better to be lucky than good!Hardy doubled in the top of the tenth inning, setting up the redemption opportunity for Hundley who singled home what would be the game-winning run.Zach Britton came on for the save, giving up a single and walk with one out, before inducing a game-ending double-play grounder.There is no way to speak of this game other than to call it a great win for the Baltimore Orioles as they open their most difficult road trip of the season. This is the sort of thing a team can build upon. Today was a game the Orioles should not have won, but they hung in there and hung in there some more until they came away with a victory.It was great to see Schoop get the two homers. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it before \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m so impressed with the way the ball comes off his bat \xe2\x80\xa6 it really has authority and carries well. J.J. Hardy is now hitting over .300 and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take this all day rather than the home runs at a .235 average.\xc2\xa0 It is great to see Adam Jones having game after game with hits \xe2\x80\x93 tripling home two runs today and playing great defense.Paragraph by paragraph, I am writing an article for publication after the season\xe2\x80\x99s end that will detail highlights and great wins for this 2014 club.

Just checking. What we saw yesterday was a game in which the concept of the \xe2\x80\x9cFighting Showalters\xe2\x80\x9d was typified. Most people now liberally use that term for a game in which the Orioles battled back and thus fought until the final out. Granted, that was the original meaning of the term. However while the Baltimore Orioles did trail early in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game, they were also coming off of a 9-0 loss to the same Cleveland team one day prior. There was a chance that it stood to reason they might not have much pop.That certainly appeared to be the case from the get go. Starter Miguel Gonzalez seemed to have a problem locating home plate umpire Alan Porter\xe2\x80\x99s revolving strike zone. When he did, it seemed that Cleveland bats found the ball. Gonzalez loaded the bases with nobody down, and the Orioles and Gonzalez were forced to go into\xc2\xa0stay out of the big inning mode. Oriole-killer Lonnie Chisenhall gave Cleveland a 1-0 lead with a sac fly-RBI, and former Oriole-killer (from his NY days) Nick Swisher ran the score to 2-0 with a sac fly-RBI of his own.So to his credit, Gonzalez did limit the damage.

When Cleveland manager Terry Francona didn\xe2\x80\x99t challenge, the score stood tied at two. LaterCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportsin the inning Nelson Cruz sent a fly ball towards the bullpen area that started carrying a good bit. The ball barely cleared the wall, and the Orioles led 4-2.Preston Guilmet, Brian Matusz, and Zach Britton combined to pitch three innings in relief, and gave up a base hit and a walk. This incarnation of the Baltimore Orioles seems to be somewhat similar to the 2012 team that went to the postseason in the sense that the bullpen closes the door. All of that however is contingent on the starting pitcher getting deep into the game; while the O\xe2\x80\x99s would like to see seven innings out of their starters, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s six innings from yesterday.Should fans read into anything in regards to the bullpen doors swinging open in the ninth yesterday and Zach Britton emerging? Tough to say for sure, although this was Britton\xe2\x80\x99s second save on the year. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning or arguing about until Tommy Hunter comes off the DL and is ready to play again. That\xe2\x80\x99s when the real question of\xc2\xa0who closes will come to be answered.In that vain, keep in mind that the O\xe2\x80\x99s can keep Hunter on a rehab assignment for 20 days or so. I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that they\xe2\x80\x99ll do that, however if Showalter is seriously considering Zach Britton as the full time closer, perhaps they\xe2\x80\x99ll keep Hunter down in the minors for a few extra days so as to get an extended look at Britton. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, but it\xe2\x80\x99s an option. The fact is that DL stints and rehab assignments can be easily manipulated in MLB.  It\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see if Hunter is the closer when he returns from the DL. The Orioles head to Milwaukee for a three-game set with the Brew Crew, starting this afternoon at 2 PM eastern time. Chris Tillman will take to the bump to open the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 rare visit to the state of Wisconsin. Milwaukee is a hot team right now, and should provide some stiff competition for the Birds. Furthermore the Orioles will of course have to surrender their DH this week given the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re in an NL park. Tillman will need to improve on his previous start in Pittsburgh in which he was chased in the second inning last week; as Tillman would be the first to admit, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about fastball command. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Milwaukee\xe2\x80\x99s Kyle Lohse.On behalf of Birds Watcher and the Fansided Network, I want to take a moment to wish all Americans a Happy Memorial Day today. We should all take a moment or two to remember our current service members and of course our veterans today, and everyday. We\xe2\x80\x99re able to watch baseball and so forth only because America has always answered the call in defending her freedom.

Tim has been a collegiate football coach since 1973. That is when he began as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, Western Oregon State. Since then, he has had stints as a position coach at Oregon State, UCLA, SMU, and the University of Washington. He is now the inside linebackers coach at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas (UNLV). As a result of this, the Hundleys moved around a lot when Nick was a kid. He was born while his dad was coaching at Oregon State. They made some well-known friends with all of this mobility. The biggest one has a Baltimore tie. That would be football coach Rick Neuheisel, the former quarter back coach and offensive coordinator of the Ravens.    Coach Neuheisel and Tim Hundley were at the University of Washington at the same time. They befriended one another and their families grew close as well. In fact, Neuheisel would invite them to his Lake Washington-adjacent home to ride jet skis.    As was a normal part of his nomadic childhood, Nick attended two different high schools but he finished up at Lake Washington High. There, he was a four-time letter-man on the baseball team and was named ""all-state"" following his senior season. This caught the interest of the Florida Marlins, who drafted him in the fifth round in 2002. He declined and instead enrolled at one of the few west coast universities that his father had not coached, the University of Arizona. Then came all of the collegiate baseball success. He was a ""Freshman All-American"" in 2003 and was named a second team All-American in 2005. He was again drafted in 2005, this time, by the San Diego Padres.    It would take Hundley parts of four seasons to reach San Diego. In two different years, he was lauded for his defensive prowess. Once in 2005, being recognized as the best defensive catcher in the Padres system. Then again in 2007 when he was named the best in the Texas League. However, in that time, he went from the number eight prospect in their system in 2006, to completely falling off the map in 2008, the year he would finally make his major league debut. That year of 2008 would continue to be lucky as Nick married his wife, Amy. The couple has been together ever since and now has a daughter, who was born last August.    Every holiday season, Nick and Amy have hosted ""Shop with a Jock"" at local Target stores in the San Diego-area. There, they help\xc2\xa0kids from a school for homeless children and let them pick out new shoes and clothes. By all accounts, Hundley looks to be one of the most likable guys in baseball. He is continually positive and up beat. I mean, he just oozes good vibes. Check out what he had to say after being traded to the O\'s: ""If there was one place I\'d want to be, it would be here,"" he said. ""When (GM Josh Byrnes) told me I was going to Baltimore, it was really, really exciting."" He then added this. ""The winning atmosphere, great tradition...Unbelievable park, the fans and city. A storied manager, a guy I know I can learn a lot from in terms of getting prepared and running games."" He seems cheesy, but I love this guy already. Some Favorites  animal: dogs outdoor activity: fishing sport(s) (besides baseball): swimming and racquetball  What\'s Ahead For the Orioles right now, Hundley appears to be the starting catcher of the moment.\xc2\xa0The reason is that Hundley is more of a classic catcher in that he can play some solid defense, but he is really not going to hit too much.    Over his career, he has thrown out 130 of the 470 stolen base attempts. That works out to a percentage of 27.7; not bad. Whereas Steve Clevenger has a career rate of half that; 13.3 percent. At the plate, he is mediocre, to be kind. Maybe I am just spoiled by Matt Wieters\' production in the early goings of the season, but some of Hundley\'s numbers are tough to look at, especially his on-base percentage. It is the same as his batting average. That\'s right, he has played in 33 games in 2014, and has yet to walk. Granted, that is only 59 plate appearances and many times he is coming into the game as a pinch hitter, but that is still ridiculous and not exactly a trait that the Orioles needed in another player. He is hitting .271, but he has been pretty lucky with a batting average on balls in play of .333. That is bound to fall back to his career average, just below .300, and when it does, so will his batting average. For his career, he is striking out 22 percent of the time, walking; seven percent. Both are sub-par. Though I\'m sure Buck will again stick to using the righty bat, Hundley, against left-handers, it will still not make much sense. Hundley has managed a .199 average against southpaws in his career. Overall, the move to get him was a necessary one and Troy Patton was expendable. However, this is not an impact bat. He is serviceable, can throw out some guys on the base-path, and is an upgrade at what the Orioles have currently, but he is no healthy Wieters.

If you compare yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game to his last start, you could say that there was marked improvement. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.2 IP, 7 H, 6 R, 4 BB, 7 K. However Tillman still struggled with his fastball command, and he struggled to find the strike zone for much of his outing. In fairness, he held Milwaukee scoreless in the second and pitched a clean fifth. However the question remains, why is Tillman struggling? Is he injured? Is there a mechanical problem?Unfortunately I don\xe2\x80\x99t have those answers for readers \xe2\x80\x93 right now. But it\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see how Tillman adjusts in his next start, which is Saturday in Houston. While Houston might come across as a \xe2\x80\x9cget well\xe2\x80\x9d type of game (and I say that keeping in mind that the Orioles cannot underestimate any opponent), if Tillman struggles again might the Orioles skip him in the rotation with an off day coming next Monday?The O\xe2\x80\x99s found themselves down 1-0 early as Jean Segura led off with a triple and he was doubled home by Ryan Braun. However in what would become a theme for the day, the Baltimore Orioles battled\xc2\xa0back. Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 two-RBI triple in the top of the third gave the Fighting Showalters the lead. Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-double would score Jones, and the Birds led 3-1.Milwaukee began chipping away, and they cut the lead to 3-2 on former Oriole Mark Reynolds\xe2\x80\x98 sac fly-RBI in the last of the aforementioned third inning. However Jean Segura would haunt Tillman yet again with a two-RBI double to seize the lead back for Milwaukee, who would also chase Tillman in the last of the sixth on back-to-back solo homers by Kris Davis and Lyle Overbay.However the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 the Fighting Showalters, that is \xe2\x80\x93 weren\xe2\x80\x99t quite done. Jonathan Schoop\xe2\x80\x98s bat came alive with a solo homer in the seventh to bring the Birds to within one. And the score remained 6-4 as the game went to the top of the ninth. Former Oriole Francisco Rodriguez came in to close things out for Milwaukee. To further infuriate Orioles fans, Rodriguez (who struggled after being traded to the O\xe2\x80\x99s last year \xe2\x80\x93 from Milwaukee no less) came in as the hottest closer in baseball. He was 17-for-18 in save opportunities. Sure thing, right? Not so fast\xe2\x80\xa6I said that this column started out in the same manner it would have otherwise begun prior to the ninth inning. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it ended the same way I had planned up to that point. After two quick outs, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 chances appeared to be dimming. However Jonathan Schoop picked a good time to net his second homer of the game, as he hit the first pitch he saw over the left field fence. Delmon Young followed that up with a pinch-hit single, and Buck Showalter promptly inserted David Lough as a pinch-runner. With his lightning speed, Lough scored without a throw on Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-double, and the game was suddenly tied at six.  As was written earlier on Birds Watcher, David Lough might be best utilized as a pinch-runner. Milwaukee put two runners on base with one out in the last of the ninth, however former Oriole Mark Reynolds came up big in a sense for his former team. He lined out to J.J. Hardy at short, who doubled the runner up at third base to end the threat. The O\xe2\x80\x99s may well have gotten some luck on that play, however a slight amount of luck is a big part of any comeback win.Courtesy of Benny Sieu-USA TODAY SportsIncidentally, J.J. Hardy began his career in Milwaukee. He received a nice ovation from the Miller Park crowd during pregame introductions. However what the fans probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect was that he would smack a clutch double with two outs in the tenth inning against his former team. That brought catcher Nick Hundley to the plate, who was making his Oriole debut after being traded to the Birds on Saturday from San Diego. Hundley sent an RBI-single to left field, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly had grabbed a 7-6 lead.Buck Showalter brought his left hand up to begin the last of the tenth, and Zach Britton emerged once again from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pen to close out the game. Britton recorded out number one on a ground out, but then proceeded to allow runners to reach first and second on a base hit and a walk. Milwaukee sent up Irving Falu as a pinch-hitter in hopes of him at least tying the game. However Britton induced a 4-3 double-play, ending the game and winning it for the Fighting Showalters.For a team that\xe2\x80\x99s had a few games get away from them which they should have won, this was a huge victory. Perhaps it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the biggest comeback of all time in terms of the number of runs made up, however I would submit it was the best comeback of the season thus far. Against great odds and a closer that had been clutch to that point, the Orioles typified the concept of playing until the final out. \xc2\xa0What happens from here remains to be seen, but this is the type of game one might point back to as one where things really got rolling.Wei-Yin Chen gets the ball in tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game two in Milwaukee, and he finds the Orioles in dire need of a long outing from a starter. Part of that is due to Tillman not going deep into yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game, however in truth it was also an extra inning game so that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not on Tillman. (In fact he found himself as the beneficiary of that.) Chen will be opposed by Matt Garza, with whom the Orioles are familiar based on his time in Tampa. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

05/30/2014,"[(""The Best 'One and Done' Orioles - Camden Chat"", "" Baltimore television and radio personality Mark Viviano posed an interesting question after Nelson Cruz hit his 17th home run of the season on Tuesday in Milwaukee.      Pondering Nelson Cruz 17 HR, 46 RBI. IF he's 1-&-done w O's could he be best 1-&-done ever for O's? Reggie 27 HR, 91 RBI in '76. Any better?\r \xe2\x80\x94 Mark Viviano (@MarkWJZ) May 28, 2014     Cruz has (as of Thursday) produced over 2 bWAR for the Orioles thanks to his MLB leading 19 home runs. He could well be on his way to a 5+ WAR season. It is likely that this will be his only season in Baltimore, as he will almost assuredly land the big dollar, multi-year deal he hoped to land this past off-season. So I figured I'd comb through the\xc2\xa0Baseball Reference archives in search of an answer to Viviano's question. The results were quite interesting and somewhat surprising. Reggie Jackson (1976) Viviano's assumption was correct. Reggie Jackson put up a pretty darn good season during his one year as an Oriole. After\xc2\xa0holding out over contract demands resulted in him missing the first 16 games of the season, Jackson would go on to produce 5.3 bWAR in just 134 games. He hit 27 home runs, good for a tie for 2nd in the AL, and led the AL in SLG% (.502) and OPS+ (155). As an added bonus, he stole a career high 28 bases, his 80% success rate ranking 5th in the AL that year. But his efforts would not be enough to help an Orioles squad in transition catch the AL East champion Yankees, as the Birds finished a distant 2nd with an 88-74 record. Jackson would, of course, go on to sign a lucrative free agent contract with those Yankees the following off-season, and win two World Series rings during his 5 years in the Bronx.    Somewhat surprisingly, Jackson is the only significant positional player to produce a very good '1 and Done' season for the Orioles. Center fielder Chris Singleton produced a 1.8 bWAR season for the O's in 2002 before being granted free agency after the season. And 3B Danny Valencia was worth 0.9 bWAR over his 170 plate appearances with the 2013 Orioles.    Kevin Brown (1995) Following 6 modestly successful season with the Rangers, Brown signed a 1-year contract with the Orioles after the ending of the 1994 player's strike. He looked to be the perfect complement to young starters Mike Mussina and Ben McDonald in the Baltimore rotation, and he produced to that effect. 172.1 innings pitched over 26 starts resulted in a 4.3 bWAR thanks to a 3.60 ERA (3.49 FIP) and a 133 ERA+. But much like Reggie Jackson's lone season in Charm City, the club was in a transition phase. Johnny Oates had been fired following a 2nd place finish in '94 and replaced by Cleveland Pitching Coach Phil Regan. The pitching staff flourished, allowing a 2nd best 4.44 runs/game, but the offense floundered, scouring a well below average of 4.89 runs/game. Brown would sign a multi-year contract with the Florida Marlins during the off-season and transform into one of the most dominant pitchers in the game over the following two seasons. He led the NL in ERA (.,89) and ERA+ (255) in 1996, and helped the Marlins win their first World Series in 1997. He actually took a near $1 million pay cut from his 1995 salary with the O's to his 1996 salary with the Marlins. Oh, what could have been if he had remained with the O's during the '96 & '97 season...    David Wells (1996) With the departure of Brown the Orioles needed to fill a large hole in their rotation. Who better to fill such a spot than David Wells! In the final year of his contract with Detroit, Wells was shipped to Baltimore for a couple of young outfield prospects. Wells didn't pitch well, putting up a 5.14 ERA and 97 ERA+. But he did eat innings; 224.1 over 34 starts to be exact. And those innings resulted in his compiling 2.9 bWAR. Combined with the contributions of Mike Mussina and Scott Erickson, Wells helped propel the Birds to the playoffs for the first time since 1983. Wells earned the win in the O's only victory during that\xc2\xa0tainted ALCS of 1996. Like Reggie Jackson 20 years prior, Wells would head up to Gotham following his one season with Baltimore and experience numerous career highlights, including pitching a Perfect Game and winning a World Series ring in 1998. Mike Torrez (1975) Torrez was involved in one of the better trades in Orioles history, coming from Montreal along with Ken Singleton in exchange for a soon to be out of baseball Dave McNally, young outfielder Rich Coggins, and a minor leaguer. A year later Torrez would be part of the package sent to Oakland in exchange for one Reggie Jackson. In between, he put up 3.5 bWAR over his 36 starts and 270.2 IP. In spite of a league leading 133 walks he managed to pitch to a 3.06 ERA and complied a 20-9 Win-Loss record. He would go on to have an even better '76 season with Oakland, thanks in large part to cutting his walk rate significantly. Early in the '77 season he would join Jackson in the Bronx via a trade, and would go on to earn two Wins in the World Series.    Mark Eichhorn (1994) Easily the most surprising name here. Eichhorn was a 33 year old middle reliever who had spent the bulk of his career with either Toronto or the Angels. The Orioles signed him to a 2 year deal prior to the '94 season, and he pitched exceptionally well during the strike-shortened season. 2.6 bWAR produced in just 71.0 innings pitched over 43 games is pretty impressive stuff. Particularly when he only struck out 35 in that span. Keeping the ball in the yard was his skill, and allowing just 1 home run allowed him to keep his ERA at a sparkling 2.15 for the season. \xc2\xa0He would have been a strong part of the O's 'pen in '95 but missed the entire season due to injury, thus a 1 and Done career with the Orioles for Eichhorn. Not Orioles related, but Eichhorn's 1986 season is rather bananas. A 25 year old with Toronto, he put up 7.4 bWAR in 157.0 IP with a 14-6 record, 1.72 ERA, and 166 Ks. What is remarkable is that he did all of this without starting a single game! 7.4 WAR strictly pitching long relief in 69 games. Mind boggling.

Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsWhat do you mean, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Baltimore Orioles are a .500 team?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Well, first, they are; their record right now is currently 26-26. And secondly, that is as good as they are right now. About half of the time they have a well-pitched game, and half of the time they hit the ball decently \xe2\x80\xa6 so, put that together and you have a team giving you a .500 performance.Go ahead and think of me or call me negative, but this is the current reality. It is honestly not my nature to be a downer about the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and other than one infamous person whom I\xe2\x80\x99ve historically annoyed by occasional critical statements of truth, the criticisms I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten on this and other writing platforms about the Orioles is that I have been far more often accused of carrying their water with starry-eyed optimism.So, if you find me too negative today (and in the vein of starry eyes) let me say that my credentials as a fan of the Baltimore Orioles date back to long before most of you reading this were even a twinkle in your father\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. I personally saw Frank Robinson win the fourth and final game of the 1966 World Series from my seat in right field on that wonderful, sunny October day at Memorial Stadium.did you think you were signing up for a .500 team in 2014?But here\xe2\x80\x99s the deal, did you think you were signing up for a .500 team in 2014? After Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game is in the books, the season will be one-third complete. Did you think that $50 million worth of starting pitcher would bring a record of 6-18 and 4.65 ERA? That is the current pace for Ubaldo Jimenez. If I told you in March that the Baltimore Orioles would have a losing home record at the end of May, would you have believed me?Yes, there have been a lot of injuries. But like Buck frequently says, \xe2\x80\x9cNobody is going to feel sorry for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Lots of teams have lots of injuries. And didn\xe2\x80\x99t you think that the O\xe2\x80\x99s had enough depth to cover injuries reasonably well?  And here\xe2\x80\x99s more of the deal. If this was 2011, we would be reasonably content with 26-26. Actually, that year at this point the team was 24-28 \xe2\x80\xa6 so, there\xe2\x80\x99s something\xe2\x80\x94the current Orioles are two games better right now than the 2011 team that ended 69-93. And beyond that, on this date in 2011, those Orioles had a winning record of 15-14 at Camden Yards, as compared to 11-12 so far this season.Enough of that, let\xe2\x80\x99s turn it around and look at it from the other side. There is more talent here than there was in 2011. One would imagine that Chris Davis will not continue to bat .237 and Manny Machado .216.\xc2\xa0 Matt Wieters is going to be throwing a baseball today and can hopefully return in a number of weeks.

Josh Stinson got the start for Norfolk. He went 4.1 innings and gave up four earned runs off of eight hits. Stinson also struck out eight in his outing as well.Although Xavier Paul went 0-4 on the night, on two separate occasions a wild pitch occurred when he was up to bat and two runs scored off these mistakes from the Lehigh Valley pitchers. One of these wild pitches came in the ninth inning with the Tides down 4-1. After a wild pitch with the bases loaded scored a run making it a two-run game, Chris Marrero stepped up to the plate with two outs.After Marrero worked the count to 2-1 with runners on second and third, he connected on a pitch up in the zone for a line drive single to center field. The runner from third scored easily making it a one run game, but Brett Wallace got the green light, rounded third and headed for home. Unfortunately the game ended there when Lehigh Valley\xe2\x80\x99s center fielder threw the ball \xe2\x80\x9con an invisible rope\xe2\x80\x9d to home where the throw beat the runner for the third and final out of the game.Although he got thrown out at home for the last out, Wallace had a good game at the plate, going 2-4 with two singles. He accounted for half of Norfolks hits in the ballgame as well. Steve Lombardozzi was one of six Norfolk batters who did not record a hit in the game; going 0-3 in the game. This lowers Lombardozzi\xe2\x80\x99s average to .284. The loss drops the Tides\xe2\x80\x99 record to 20-34 on the year and the team currently sits in fourth place of the South Division in the International League.Bowie BaysoxThe Bowie Baysox got crushed Thursday night, losing to the Akron Rubber Ducks by a score of 16-4. After Bowie\xe2\x80\x99s starter, Zach Davies, was knocked out of the game early only going 3.1 innings and giving up three runs. The Baysox bullpen was unproductive to say the least. Between the four Bowie relievers, a combined 13 runs off of 13 hits and 10 walks.In regards to the offense, there was a bright spot; however, insignificant it may be in such a brutal loss. Christian Walker went 2-3 on the night with an RBI single in the bottom of the eighth to score Bowie\xe2\x80\x99s final run of the night. This improved Walker\xe2\x80\x99s batting average to .330 on the year.Bowie\xe2\x80\x99s record on the year is now 29-24 and they currently sit in second place of the Western Division in the Eastern League.Frederick KeysThe Frederick Keys lost on Thursday night by a score of 3-6 against the Lynchburg Hillcats. This loss earned Lynchburg the sweep over the Keys in the three-game series.The Keys\xe2\x80\x99 starting pitcher, Brady Wager, pitched well as he went six solid innings giving up one earned run off of six hits in the process. Frederick was down 2-1 going into the top of the seventh inning. However, they took the leas thanks to the two-run double of Glynn Davis. This lead would be short-lived as \xc2\xa0the Hillcats scored the final four runs of the game off of right-handed reliever Miguel Chalas. Chalas gave up a game-tying home run in the bottom of the seventh and then allowed three more runs to score in the eighth inning.Davis\xe2\x80\x99 two-RBI double improved his batting average to .314 on the year. Four other Keys players each recorded a single hit, including Zane Chavez who also hit a double that scored a run in the game on Thursday.Frederick is now 21-30 on the year and sits at the bottom of the Northern Division in the Carolina League.Delmarva ShorebirdsThe Delmarva Shorebirds did something Thursday night none of the other Baltimore Minor League Affiliates nor could the Orioles do: Win. The Shorebirds picked up the win against the Lakewood BlueClaws by a score of 4-3.Down 2-0 early, the Shorebirds rallied back, scoring one in the fourth and another two in the fifth. All three of these runs were hit in by two Trey Mancini RBI singles. The Shorebirds added another run to their lead in the seventh inning with a sacrifice fly from Jeff Kemp scoring Mike Yastrzemski from third. Despite giving up a run to Lakewood in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Shorebirds were able to hang on and\xc2\xa0won the series opener.Mancini\xe2\x80\x99s two hit game improves his average on the year to .314. The Notre Dame graduate also now has 26 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s on the year, which is second-best on the team next to Yastrzemski\xe2\x80\x99s 28 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s.The Shorebirds were able to hold on their lead because of\xc2\xa0Jimmy Yacabonis outing on the mound. The right-hander pitched two scoreless innings to end the game where he did not allow a hit and struck out three batters as well. This was Yacabonis\xe2\x80\x99 13th save on the year for the Shorebirds.The win improves Delmarva\xe2\x80\x99s record to 31-22 and they are currently in second place of the Northern Division in the South Atlantic League.\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Batting Practice Pitcher Cherishes Rise to the Big Leagues ...', '     Supported by    Baseball  Batting Practice Pitcher Cherishes Rise to the Big Leagues  By DAVID WALDSTEINMAY 29, 2014    Continue reading the main story Share This Page  Continue reading the main story                if (             window.magnum             && window.magnum.getFlags().indexOf(\'headlineBalancer\') > 0             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.shouldRun()         ) {             window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize();         }         Photo       Danilo Valiente working before a recent game.

A former player and manager in Cuba, Valiente came to the United States in 2006 and soon after began working at the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 minor league complex.This year, before spring training, the Yankees promoted him because he is a master at throwing batting practice. After years of toiling in Cuba and receiving bits of information about his favorite team \xe2\x80\x94 the Yankees, of course \xe2\x80\x94 through treasured videotapes of games, he was now a full-time member of the coaching staff.Jeter thought Valiente deserved the full fruits of that promotion. So on the eve of his final home opener, with all the emotion that may have held, Jeter made a special request to the powers above. He wanted Valiente to be introduced at Yankee Stadium, which was why he summoned Valiente to the back of the plane \xe2\x80\x94 to tell him to be prepared.

But this year was different: He was wearing a Yankees uniform from opening day as a full-time staff member.\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to see how much he really does,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s behind the scenes, obviously, but everyone here knows how much he does.

That led to a job coaching Metropolitanos, a top club in Havana. Valiente coached for 15 years, earning the equivalent of about $7.50 a month, while also working in a hospital. He was given most living essentials, including a small home and basic transportation.\xe2\x80\x9cNo car,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly a bicycle.\xe2\x80\x9dOne of the highlights of Valiente\xe2\x80\x99s career was coaching third base for the Cuban national team on March 28, 1999, when it hosted the Baltimore Orioles in Havana. Perhaps most important, at Boyeros, he had the chance to work with Rolando Nunez, known as Chavito, who taught him the art of throwing batting practice.

Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles may be the professional team from the state of Maryland, but they are certainly not a team when on the baseball diamond.With a second loss to the Houston Astros in the second game of the four-game series, the Orioles drop to 26-27. They are four-and-a-half games behind the division-leading Toronto Blue Jays, and two games behind the New York Yankees.The Orioles hold a slim one-and-a-half game lead over the heating-up Boston Red Sox.Miguel Gonzalez pitched a fantastic game taking a no-hitter into the sixth inning. However, the offense was only able to put up one run.After scoring once in the second inning, the Orioles did not get a hit until the fourth inning. Nelson Cruz led off the inning with a single.Adam Jones who is hitting .288 with 10 doubles, six home runs, and 29 RBIs. He popped up in foul territory.Chris Davis hit into a double play to end the inning. Three of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 best hitters cannot connect hits together to bring in a single insurance run to support their pitcher.In the seventh inning when Davis reached base by a fluke in center field, the Orioles could not use the second chance to get a run, let alone another hit.More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryThe Orioles are not playing as a team, but seem like nine individual players. Some might even feel they are playing for the name on the back of the jersey, not the name on the front.They have one of the top offenses in the league, but cannot play with their pitchers. The Orioles could have the best offense in MLB history, but if they cannot play in sync with their pitchers, there will be nothing but losses stacking up.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 batting average is more than 10 points higher when they are behind by more than four runs compared to when trying to come back in games with a four or less run deficit.When the pitching keeps the Orioles within reach, the offense fails to contribute. The Orioles are scoring runs when the game is already out of reach, but not when it is in reach.With two outs and runners in scoring position, the Orioles are batting less than .250. The players cannot connect hits, and have not done so when they have needed to.The pitching cannot play with the offense either. When the offense puts up six or more runs, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 team ERA is above seven.The more runs the Orioles score, the more runs the pitching allows. However, this is a number that does not stand out, because the Orioles offense has overcome the poor pitching to win the games.They never seem to be on the same page.\xc2\xa0One game has great pitching, but no offense. Another game has a lot of offense, but no pitching. A game may have some offense, but it is only coming from one player.Or, a game will have good starting pitching, but the bullpen falters to give up the lead. Or the starter is bad, but the bullpen is good.There is no continuity with this Baltimore team.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 players are too comfortable in my opinion. Buck Showalter needs to shake things up.\xc2\xa0He needs to mix the lineup around to change the mindsets of the players. Clearly, with the way it is set up now, the Orioles are not hitting as a team, but as individuals.\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles discover ""base on balls"" rules loophole, beat ...', ' Saturday afternoon, as they sought to break out of the mire of a four-game losing streak, the Orioles discovered a little-known loophole in the rules governing baseball. They learned that if a pitcher throws a batter four pitches that are outside of the strike zone, the batter shall be allowed to take first base. This obscure rule produces what is known as a ""base on balls""; the batter is safe at first even if he walks, without ever having to swing the bat.    Orioles hitters took three of these bases on balls in a row in the top of the fifth inning, including two that came with the bases loaded. A base on balls with the bases loaded results in a run being forced home. This accounted for two of their runs in a 4-1 victory over the Houston Astros. It remains to be seen whether Major League Baseball will take action to close this loophole before it can do any more damage to the integrity of the game of baseball. After watching the Orioles flail away against the underperforming starting pitcher tandem of Brad Peacock and Brett Oberholtzer in the previous two games, there was little hope going in of the Orioles managing to solve one of the possible breakout aces of the 2014 season in Dallas Keuchel. This was not a predictable day of baseball. Noodle-armed Nick Markakis led off the game with a double. The play at second was close; Astros manager Bo Porter came out to stall for time, but declined to challenge the result. Replays showed on MASN indicated that Jose Altuve tagged Markakis before he was safely in to second base. An out later, Markakis would score on a sacrifice fly by Nelson Cruz, which gave the Orioles a 1-0 lead.    That sac fly represented the 50th run batted in of the season for Cruz, tying a record set by Chris Davis last year for most RBI before the end of May in franchise history.    Orioles starter Chris Tillman overcame some early shakiness to turn in a solid outing after some recent disasters. His problem inning was the second inning, in which he loaded the bases thanks to a double and a pair of hit by pitches. With one out, Robbie Grossman grounded a ball just along the edge of the grass down the first base line. Tillman was in position to field the ball, but opted to let the ball try to roll foul. The ball stopped right against the foul line in fair territory, scoring a run to tie the game 1-1 and keeping the bases loaded. This was not a good decision. Still, Tillman managed to escape without any further damage, getting a shallow pop-up from Marwin Gonzalez followed by a Jose Altuve flyout to right field. Altuve\'s ball was tailing away from Nick Markakis and looked like it was going to end up as a bases-clearing double, but Markakis managed to chase it down in the air to end the inning.    The score stayed knotted at 1-1 until the fifth inning, which was when the Orioles made their curious rulebook discovery. Manny Machado and Caleb Joseph each reached on singles while others made outs. With men on first and third and two down, Markakis was the first to take advantage of the newly-discovered ""base on balls"" loophole to load the bases. Perhaps inspired by this, left fielder Steve Pearce did not swing at some of Keuchel\'s pitches outside of the strike zone, allowing him to walk to first base as well. This particular ""base on balls"" meant that Machado scored. Cruz followed with another of these ""base on balls"", which forced in Joseph and gave the Orioles a 3-1 lead. Because some things never change, Adam Jones followed this radical back-to-back-to-back ""base on balls"" sequence by striking out swinging. Staked to this lead, Tillman pitched through 6.2 innings with what didn\'t look to be his best stuff. However, he kept the Astros from doing any more damage in the game, helped out periodically by his defense. Pearce made a sweet play on a line drive off the left field scoreboard from Marwin Gonzalez in the fourth inning, bare-handing the carom and firing in to second base to throw out Gonzalez trying to stretch the ball into a double.    In the seventh, Tillman walked leadoff batter Grossman, then induced a double-play grounder from Gonzalez. He had thrown 110 pitches. That was enough for O\'s manager Buck Showalter, who has shown too much faith in his starters at times. He brought in Ryan Webb for the last out of the seventh and left him in for the eighth. What a concept. Webb struck out two while not allowing a baserunner in 1.1 innings. Tillman\'s final line was one run on four hits and two walks in 6.2 innings. He struck out three. Some days, that\'s all you need. He was credited with a win for the game, improving his record to 5-2 despite a 4.63 ERA. Trade market starter Jeff Samardzija shakes his head. The Orioles tacked on an insurance run in the eighth inning thanks to a solo home run by Cruz, his 20th of the season. That\'s even more than the 19 Davis had at the end of May last season. Adding two RBI on the walk and the home run gave Cruz 52 on the season, meaning he now holds the Orioles record for most RBI by the end of May. Just for fun, he hit a ground rule double in the game as well. The guy is slugging .675. Wow. Zach Britton came on in the ninth to close out the game. He allowed a leadoff single to Matt Dominguez, but then he struck out pinch hitter Jesus Guzman on three pitches and got a double-play ball from pinch hitter Chris Carter to end the game and snap the Orioles losing streak. The win brings the Orioles back to a .500 record at 27-27. They are 4.5 games back of division-leading Toronto and 2.5 games behind the second place Yankees, both of whom won earlier on Saturday. Sunday afternoon, the O\'s will be back in action with a chance to salvage a series split against the recently-hot Astros. Wei-Yin Chen starts opposite former Oriole Scott Feldman in the 2:10 game.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Frustration builds for the Baltimore Orioles - Birds Watcher', 'At this point I have to wonder if the Baltimore Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t trying to disprove just about everything I\xe2\x80\x99ve said and that I know about baseball. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how many times I\xe2\x80\x99ve written\xc2\xa0it starts with pitching. That\xe2\x80\x99s far from an insightful piece of baseball knowledge, and in fact it\xe2\x80\x99s basically common knowledge for anyone that\xe2\x80\x99s around the game on a daily basis. Yet last night Miguel Gonzalez posted a quality start. In truth, he took a no-hitter into the sixth inning. However at the end all that matters I suppose is the bottom line\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and unfortunately that bottom line has Gonzalez on the losing end of a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s duel. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.2 IP, 5 H, 2 R, 2 BB, 4 K. Far from shabby if you ask me, and I suspect that Buck Showalter and the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense would say the same.  Showalter on Miguel[caption id=""attachment_12014"" align=""alignright"" width=""300""] Courtesy of Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports[/caption]Gonzalez: \xe2\x80\x9cHe deserved a much better fate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Many people criticized Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s decision to send Gonzalez out in the seventh inning; the fact is that his pitch count was not high. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it works with pitchers \xe2\x80\x93 sometimes in later innings they just lose it, no matter how good they were before.The Orioles took an early 1-0 lead in the second inning when Adam Jones doubled and was singled home by J.J. Hardy. And that lead stood up for some time. As Showalter also said after the game, Houston got a great quality start out of their pitcher as well. While it sounds redundant, the O\xe2\x80\x99s seem to have a knack for running into good pitching.However Adam Jones said it best after the game in that opposing teams are getting the clutch hits, and the Baltimore Orioles are not. Teams go through these types of stretches throughout the season, which is why we constantly hear the cliche\xc2\xa0it\xe2\x80\x99s a long season. However, frustration will often start to build on a team when you\xe2\x80\x99re constantly seeing balls drop in and clutch hits coming off of opposing bats.Jose Altuve recorded Houston\xe2\x80\x99s first hit of the game on an infield single to short in the sixth. And again, that really illustrates the type of stretch the Orioles are in. It\xe2\x80\x99s not always the hard hit balls or the deep shots that are undoing the O\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s the simple things in the game. Dominguez would lead off the seventh with a double, and he would be doubled home to tie the game by Grossman. Villar would then add an RBI-double of his own, and in a span of a few minutes the O\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly trailed 2-1.The Birds would put two runners on in the eighth, however Steve Pearce would fly out to left field to end the threat. Again, that illustrates how things are going for this team right now. Pearce hit the ball pretty well, but yet if it was just a little softer the game probably would have been tied. Adam Jones tried to bunt his way on base in the ninth, however the bunt went right up in the air and was caught.Chris Davis struck out to end the game, on a pitch that looked to be potentially borderline at best. The pitch was very high, and in my personal view it missed the strike zone. Davis and Buck Showalter share that thought \xe2\x80\x93 especially Showalter, who was not happy with the call at all.  After the game when talking about how the O\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t strike out too often in this game, Showalter said he specifically wasn\xe2\x80\x99t counting Davis\xe2\x80\x99 strikeout \xe2\x80\x93 since the last pitch wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a strike.  However again, those things will happen when you\xe2\x80\x99re scuffling at the plate at a team.So the O\xe2\x80\x99s now find themselves at one game under .500 for the first time since the beginning of the season. This is not a hole out of which they can\xe2\x80\x99t fight, and anyone with an inch of baseball savoir faire knows that every team will find themselves in a stretch like this at one point or another. Unfortunately for the Orioles, their bad stretch came\xc2\xa0at a time when a team in their division (Toronto) was winning nine straight games. While Toronto is now actually in a modest two-game losing streak, Jose Bautista last night threw out a runner at first base from right field (after what would normally have been a standard single) \xe2\x80\x93 for the second consecutive game.\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0how things go for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re riding high.The Orioles will try to end this losing streak this afternoon in a game that will be started by Chris Tillman, who\xe2\x80\x99s had a few poor outings in a row now. Does that trend continue, or does the law of averages at some point kick in and grant Tillman \xe2\x80\x93 and Oriole bats \xe2\x80\x93 a positive outing?

""He\'s come in with a reputation of being streaky and I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen him locked in for this long a period of time. A lot of guys at his age start figuring out who they are and learning from their mistakes through the years in more ways than one.""Cruz was suspended 50 games last year while playing for the Texas Rangers as a result of Major League Baseball\'s investigation into the Biogenesis drug scandal before signing a one-year deal with the Orioles this offseason.He agreed with Showalter\'s assessment of his recent play.""I see the ball well,"" he said. ""Like I said before, it\'s hard to be consistent for that long. I just take my routine and try to do it on a daily basis so I can stay more consistent.""The loss ends a season-best seven-game winning streak for the Astros.Tillman (5-2) allowed one run on four hits over 6 2-3 innings to bounce back after allowing 14 runs combined in his last two starts. Zach Britton pitched a scoreless ninth for his fourth save.The Orioles took the lead when Dallas Keuchel (6-3) walked home two runs in the fifth and Cruz extended the lead to 4-1 with his solo shot to left-center off Jerome Williams in the eighth.Cruz\'s 52 RBIs lead the majors and are the most in team history at the end of May, surpassing the 50 RBIs Chris Davis had entering June last year.Cruz, who also doubled on Saturday, has a 12-game hitting streak with six doubles, eight homers and 15 RBIs in that span.He was pleased that the was able to get the offense going on Saturday after scoring just two runs in the previous two games combined.""As a team we know we can score runs. No doubt,"" he said. ""We have top to bottom one of the best lineups in the league. So it was a matter of time (before) we came back and do what we were supposed to do. I think today was a great example.""Keuchel allowed six hits and three runs with three walks in six innings to end a four-game winning streak. He was done in by his lack of control on Saturday after walking just one batter in his previous four starts combined. Keuchel was coming off two stellar outings where he posted a 1.02 ERA and was named AL player of the week.""I just didn\'t have a feel,"" Keuchel said of the fifth inning. ""Give them credit for laying off a few pitches. That\'s a good team. I was lucky to get out of there with just three runs.""Manny Machado singled off Keuchel with one out in the fifth before a two-out single by Caleb Joseph. Nick Markakis walked to load the bases before the Orioles took the lead on a walk by Steve Pearce. A third straight walk \xe2\x80\x94 this one by Cruz \xe2\x80\x94 scored another run to push the lead to 3-1.Keuchel took Adam Jones to a full count before striking him out to end the inning.Markakis hit a leadoff double and scored on a sacrifice fly by Cruz with one out to put Baltimore up early.Jason Castro doubled with no outs in the second inning before Tillman plunked two of the next three batters to load the bases with one out. Robbie Grossman singled on a dribbler down the right field line to tie it at 1-1.NOTES: The series wraps up on Sunday when Baltimore\'s Wei-Yin Chen opposes Scott Feldman. \xe2\x80\xa6 Saturday was the 1,000th career game for Jones. \xe2\x80\xa6 Baltimore RHP Tommy Hunter, on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to May 21 with a left groin strain, will throw a bullpen session on Sunday. \xe2\x80\xa6 Machado, who has hit in the No. 2 spot for most of his career, was moved down to the seventh spot this week after struggling this season. Showalter is confident that Machado, who had two hits Saturday, will get back on track and thinks this move could help. ""We\'re just trying to be patient for him to work his way back into it, but that\'s a challenge,"" Showalter said. ""He gets frustrated. He hides it pretty well. He\'s the same body language, the same everything that he was last year, just not getting the return.

06/01/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: I walk the line - Birds Watcher', 'As I said yesterday following Friday night\xe2\x80\x99s loss in Houston, teams go through stretches where they lose a few games and absolutely nothing seems to be going right. However that\xe2\x80\x99s not when you have to worry; you have to get concerned when things are going so amazingly that you can barely think straight (ie-Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s nine-game winning streak). Because either way the law of averages says that the pendulum swings back in the other direction.And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we saw yesterday, as the Baltimore Orioles ended their four-game losing streak by defeating Houston 4-1. Starter Chris Tillman had a nice bounce back start after two fairly poor ones (in which he was non-decisioned). Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.2 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 2 BB, 3 K. What\xc2\xa0we saw was a pitcher who did have a few control problems early on, but also one who was good enough to get himself out of trouble.  The nature of the position is such that pitchers will get themselves into some trouble in games. The good ones are good enough to get themselves out of it. Nelson Cruz hit a sacrifice fly following Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x98 lead off double in the first inning, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had an early 1-0 lead. Tillman needed nine pitches to get out of the first inning, but the second inning was a bit of a struggle. With one out and the bases loaded, Grossman dribbled a swinging bunt up the first base line. Tillman thought better of fielding it and in effect taking a sure out at first \xe2\x80\x93 and the ball died on the chalk. So not only did a run score (which was a given unless the ball had gone foul), but everyone was safe. In retrospect that was probably a poor decision on Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s part, however following a pop out Nick Markakis made a great catch on a ball that could have cleared the bases (off the bat of Jose Altuve) to end the inning.Courtesy of Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsThis game had the feel of one where an Oriole starter had a decent outing only to stay in for one or two hitters too many \xe2\x80\x93 similar to Friday\xe2\x80\x99s game. However that changed in the fifth inning when the Orioles loaded the bases after two singles and a walk. That brought Steve Pearce to the play, who also drew a walk and suddenly the O\xe2\x80\x99s were back in the lead. To add insult to injury (from Houston\xe2\x80\x99s perspective that is), Nelson Cruz also drew a walk and the inning ended with the Birds leading 3-1.Tillman seemed to get stronger as the game went on, and he overcame a few base runners here and there over time before leaving the game. Nelson Cruz would hit his big league-leading 20th homer of the season in the eighth inning to give the Orioles some extra padding on the scoreboard. Come the last of the ninth those bullpen doors swung open again and Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x98s left hand came up, summoning Zach Britton from the \xe2\x80\x98pen to close the game. And close the game he did, ending the four-game losing streak.I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard-pressed to argue that the bats came alive, however the fact is that the O\xe2\x80\x99s won this game by working counts and drawing walks. For a team that\xe2\x80\x99s last in the big leagues in walks, I do find it interesting that they in effect won the game due in large part to two bases-loaded walks.  As Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x98s said on numerous occasions, \xe2\x80\x9cyou never know what the boys are going to have in mind for you today \xe2\x80\x93 in baseball.\xe2\x80\x9d The O\xe2\x80\x99s will have a shot to\xc2\xa0walk the line into a series split with this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game. (For the record, I\xe2\x80\x99m a huge fan of the great Man in Black and I\xe2\x80\x99ve waited years to be able to use that title.)

A strong 6.2 innings of four-hit ball with only a run allowed kept the Orioles in the game until the offense could produce enough for the 4-1 victory over the Houston Astros.The Orioles scored first, and did so in the way one likes to see\xe2\x80\x94the way of solid baseball. Nick Markakis led off the game with a double, took third on a Steve Pearce grounder to the right side behind the runner, and then scored on the sac fly to center by Nelson Cruz.After the Astros had tied the game in the second inning and were threatening for more\xe2\x80\x94having the bases loaded and two out\xe2\x80\x94Markakis ran down a fly ball to the right-field wall that likely saved three runs \xe2\x80\xa6 and the game. Manny Machado and Pearce also contributed stellar plays.The second and third Orioles runs came in a fashion practically unheard of for this team. They were patient enough at the plate to score twice in the fifth inning on back-to-back bases-loaded walks to Pearce and Cruz. The Orioles have the fewest walks in all of baseball, so this was gratifying to see.Nelson Cruz is on pace for a 60-homer seasonThe final run was scored in more typical Baltimore Orioles fashion, as Nelson Cruz hit a screaming liner out of the park in left field for his 20th homer of the season. He has 52 RBIs now, and with the season one-third complete is on pace to hit 60 bombs and drive in 156. Anybody think it is impossible?\xc2\xa0 By comparison, Chris Davis hit his 20th home run on June 2nd last year, but then did not hit #21 until the 10th.So at this point of the season the Orioles are back to .500 at 27-27.\xc2\xa0 Interestingly, the Washington Nationals have the exact same record, even as the fans of each had hoped for a better first two months of the season.

Nick Markakis is 8-for-24 off Feldman, while Machado is 3-for-5 with a triple and homer. But Adam Jones is 2-for-18 and Nelson Cruz 2-for-9.Wei-Yin Chen will take his 5-2 record and 4.50 ERA to the mound.

And he did all of that on 91 pitches (66 for strikes). This makes two very encouraging outings in a row for the Korean righty, as he went 7 IP with 6 Ks and 3 ERs allowed in his previous outing. He is quite dinger-prone, however. He's allowed 1 in each of his last 6 starts. On the plus side, he's walked just 1 batter in that same time frame, while K'ing 23. That'll limit the potential damage.    Four Tides managed multi-hit games (Berry, Marrero, De Jesus, and Casilla). Brett Wallace drew a walk and reached on an error but was otherwise held hitless. Richmond (Giants) 4 Bowie 1 A couple of Chatters were in attendance on this lovely Spring evening, so perhaps they can share their observations in the comments. Tim Berry took the bump for the Baysox and rebounded nicely from his previous dreadful outing. 7 IP on 84 pitches; he allowed 8 hits and 3 ERs while walking none and striking out 5. He is crushing lefties on the season, having allowed just a .156 / .177 / .182 slash line over 80 plate appearances. Holy domination, Batman! Righties are teeing off on him though, to the tune of .296 / .348 / .519 over 181 plate appearances. whomp whomp. So he may not be a starter long term, but he does have the look of a guy who could be Baltimore bound at some point next year. Pretty good for a 50th round pick. The offense has gone into a bit of funk this past week, scoring just 11 runs over their last 5 games. Christian Walker was held hitless, but did draw a walk. Dariel Alvarez did hit his 10th HR to account for the Baysox lone run on the evening. Niuman Romero continues to have fortune favor him as he hit 12th double of the season and drew 2 walks. Why pitchers are pitching around him to get to Walker and Alvarez is a mystery to me. Michael Ohlman was 0-3 with a walk. But he did manage to throw out 1 of 2 base bandits. Tim Berry might have something to do with that as he picked another runner off 1st.

Joe Van Meter got the start for the Keys and was serviceable enough. Keeping with the night's trend he went 7 innings, allowed 4 hits and walked 3 which led to 2 ERs. After working a nifty 1-2-3 8th inning, Matt Hobgood allowed things to get interesting in the 9th when he allowed 2 ERs after a 1 out walk.    Pre-postgame fireworks were provided courtesy of Brenden Webb and Adrian Marin, who each belted solo home runs. Glynn Davis put up his typical line of going 1 for 4 with a double, run scored, and a strikeout. Delmarva 7 Lakewood (Phillies) 0 Did another O's pitcher manage to go 7 strong innings? No. But Mitch Horacek did go 6 strong, allowing just 4 hits and a walk while getting 8 batters to whiff. The tall southpaw has put together a nice 5 game streak which has seen him yield just 3 ERs over 30.2 IP. He has K'd 32 and walked 7 in that same span. Pretty neat, pretty good.    You'll never guess what happened on defense...Mike Yastrzemski earned an Outfield Assist! Yawn. That makes 11 on the season. He is now 4 clear of a 3 way tie for 2nd which includes teammate Gregory Lorenzo. I really want to see a skills competition between Lil' Yaz and Dariel Alvarez. But I digress...Lil' Yaz also thumped 2 basehits in his 5 at bats. Chance Sisco and Conor Bierfeldt each had 3 hit nights, with the latter blasting his 4th HR of the season. DSL Cardinals 1 DSL O'sDos 4 DSL O'sUno 8 DSL Twins 1   Venezualean righty Cristian Alvarado shut down the Cards over 6 innings, allowing just 5 hits while striking out 7.

Dominican righty Francisco Jimenez held the Twins in check with 6 innings of shutout work of his own. He yielded just one hit and K'd 4.    Yeridolfo Lizardo and Victor Medina each knocked doubles vs. the Cards. (SS) Guillermo Salas had 2 singles and a walk, plus he managed to steal home.

The Orioles had an open spot on their 40-man roster after DFA'ing Evan Meek.    If you've been following the Santana story, he has been pitching in extended spring training as he recovers from left shoulder surgery, and he had a clause in his contract that he could opt out of his deal with the Orioles if he did was not activated by midnight tonight. The various Orioles beats have been reporting that the Orioles and Santana had been working on a deal, to extend his opt out date because they believed he was close to being ready to be promoted. According to\xc2\xa0MASN's Roch Kubatko, Santana technically did opt out of his contract, so by purchasing his contract the Orioles were able to place him on the disabled list so that he can make rehab starts and be ready to be promoted ot the majors. The plan that the Orioles have been publicizing is one that will have him ready to be promoted by June 18th after making three starts in the minors. The word from the Orioles is that Santana will make one more start in extended spring training either tomorrow or Wednesday, after which it will be determined if he is ready for a call up, or if he needs more time at the minors. It certainly sounds like he needs some more time in the minors, but I've learned better than to try and guess what the Orioles are thinking at times.    The reports out of Sarasota on Santana have been increasingly positive, as his fastball velocity has crept up to about 88 mph, along with a change up in the mid-70s. It remains to be seen if Santana will pitch as a starter or a reliever when he makes it to Baltimore, though\xc2\xa0Kubatko anticipates it will be as a starter. If that's the case, one of the current five will need to be traded, released, demoted, or sent to bullpen to make room for him. Which one could be anyone's decision. Unfortunately the two pitchers who have performed the worst so far, Chris Tillman and Ubaldo Jimenez, aren't going anywhere. Bud Norris has pitched too well to be sent to the bullpen at this point, and it's hard to imagine them sticking Wei-Yin Chen out there despite his tendency not to pitch deep into games. Miguel Gonzalez seems fated to be the one chopped, which is a shame as he has gotten into a groove of late. Regardless of who it will be, the starting pitchers are now on notice.

He has been to an All-Star games, came in third for the Cy Young Award and received a few votes in the MVP race. All the while his mommy was doing his laundry for him and cooking him dinner. This guy has got the life.    Bio Name: Ubaldo Jimenez Jr. Number: 31 Born: January 22, 1984 (30 years old) in Nagua, Maria Trinidad Sanchez, D.R. Height: 6\'5""  Weight: 210 lbs Bats: RIght Throws: Right Signed: in 2001 as an amateur free agent by the Colorado Rockies Became an Oriole: signed a 4-year $50 million deal on February 19, 2014 Walk-up song: ""Rie Y Llora"" by Celia Cruz Family One of the most publicized aspects of Jimenez signing with the O\'s was that his entire family would move with him. That would be his father, Ubaldo Sr., mother, Ramona, and older sister, Leidys. That\'s right, ladies. He is a single, thirty-year-old, multimillionaire, who happens to live with his parents. From everything I have read, Ubaldo\'s ""mami y papi"" seem to be his entire world, and for good reason. The elder Ubaldo was in the military for 13 years and then took up two jobs, as a bus driver and a security guard, to support his family. Ramona was a nurse before having kids. After that, she sold homemade meals to get a little extra coin.    They did this to put Ubaldo and Leidys through school and to get them English lessons as children. Ubaldo would play baseball each day from 8 a.m. to noon, have lunch and then take a bus to Santo Domingo for three hours of lessons with his sister.    Even when Jimenez was being approached by scouts, his mother was there. In an anecdote Ramona shared with USA Today she said that the New York Mets offered a $20,000 bonus if Ubaldo would sign at the age of 16. His mother served as his agent and told them that her son would be finishing high school first. In fact, that was a condition under which he signed with the Rockies the next year for a $50,000 bonus. Ramona made sure he would be allowed to graduate before playing professional baseball. Now, the entire Jimenez clan is in Baltimore. Believe it or not, that is not strange for people from the Dominican. Ubaldo is not married and in Latin America, most people stay with their parents until they have a significant other. That is fine by the Orioles big righty. Who needs a personal chef or a maid when you have your mom? She cleans and cooks anything he wants, except for his favorite meat, goat. Apparently, it\'s hard to find in the U.S. Imagine that.    Quick facts   Hidden talent: Jimenez likes to dance. However, he refused to show off his moves at the Orioles ""Talent Show"" in the spring. ""I like to dance a lot. Latin dances, hip hop, everything, Merengue, you name it,"" said Jimenez in a recent Baltimore Sun article.  Favorite movie: For Love of the Game  If he wasn\'t a baseball player: He would be a doctor. His mother originally wanted him to pursue it as a career and his sister is currently studying to become one in the Dominican.  Favorite meal: Rice, chicken, and beans (I guess goat doesn\'t go well with the beans)  Off-season spot: back to the Dominican, where he also lives with his parents.  Prized possession: a picture of his niece, Crisley, and the Dominican Flag. (This guy is just a big, old teddy bear)  What\'s Ahead Jimenez has been far from the stabilizing force that many hoped for when he was given that big deal back in February. His ERA was hovering at or above five for much of the season. He doesn\'t light up the radar gun like he used to in Colorado. And he has moments where it seems like he has forgotten where the strike zone is altogether. However, he has the chance to be the saving grace for the Orioles in 2014. The internet was abuzz last week when the birds emerged as the ""leading team"" for the services of Jeff Samardzija. The rumor mill posted a bounty of two top pitching prospects for the righty. Come again? His career ERA sits just below four (FIP: 3.82). That\'s with his red hot start to the season. He averages eight and a half strikeouts per nine innings. And batters hit .244 off of him in his career. The Orioles have that exact same pitcher in Jimenez (career ERA: 3.96, FIP: 3.79, K/9: 8.28, BAA: .240), but with Ubaldo he has the upside and track record of surging late and propelling teams into the postseason. Samardzija? Well, he plays for the Cubs.    The Dominican native has thrown no less than 176.2 innings in each of the last six seasons. He knows what it takes to make it through the grind of a major league season and has pitched in the World Series. His experience is a priceless commodity on the staff and his track record speaks for itself. Patience, Camden Chatters, patience. How do YOU think Jimenez will pitch the rest of the way?

Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.2 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 4 BB, 5 K.\xc2\xa0It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect, but Jimenez pitched more than well enough to win last night. And luckily for him manager Buck Showalter is aware of that.  Showalter is aware of all aspects of the game, especially players that keep the team in the game as Jimenez did last night. Both Jimenez and Texas starter (and former Orioles) Joe Saunders retired the respective sides with relative ease the first time through the order. They both allowed base runners, but were able to pitch out of the innings. However as the teams took their second turns through the order, hitters started to figure things out.Adam Jones worked a quality at-bat, and sat on a fastball. He got that fastball on a 2-2 count, and stroked it the opposite way. The ball faded a bit, but smacked right off the foul pole for a solo homer which put the Baltimore Orioles up 1-0 off the bat of Adam Jones. However Texas had an answer, as so many teams seem to have in that ballpark. Adrian Beltre, who\xe2\x80\x99s been an Oriole killer in the past, hit a 1-0 pitch into the left field seats and the game was tied at one after four innings.Delmon Young smacked an RBI-single in the sixth which scored Adam Jones, giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 2-1 lead. However that run came as a result of Jones\xe2\x80\x99 heads up baserunning earlier on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s flyout when he tagged up and went to third base. Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s often the small things in games that make a difference.Jimenez was lifted with two outs in the sixth, and Brian Matusz needed only one pitch to retire the side and record the final out. However Matusz was unable to continue that magic in a sense, as he gave up a solo homer to Chirinos in the last of the seventh which tied the game at two. The previous inning the O\xe2\x80\x99s had stranded the bases loaded, which many fans probably felt would find a way to come back to haunt them.However the O\xe2\x80\x99s weren\xe2\x80\x99t done yet. Delmon Young stroked an infield single with out out in the eighth, and Jonathan Schoop was hit on the arm by a pitch. That brought Caleb Jospeh to the plate, and he promptly split the outfielders in right center to plate Young and leave two runners in scoring position. Nick Markakis would follow with an RBI-single, giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s a two-run lead.And just for good measure, Manny Machado would plate Schoop with a bouncer up the middle off the pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s glove, and the Orioles took a lead of 5-2. In games such as these it\xe2\x80\x99s the team who\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98pen fails that loses, or the one who\xe2\x80\x99s bats become clutch that wins. One might argue that those are in effect the same thing, however the fact is that Oriole bats came through big in the clutch last night. Not all of the run-scoring hits were majestic shots, nor did they need to be. They needed to be good enough to get runs home \xe2\x80\x93 and they were.Courtesy of Andrew Richardson-USA TODAY SportsBut the best was yet to come off of Oriole bats. Nelson Cruz came up with Markakis and Machado on base, and hit the first pitch he saw deep \xe2\x80\x93 and I mean DEEP \xe2\x80\x93 into the Texas night. 8-2 probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite indicative of how close this game was until late, however again the Orioles pounced on Texas at just the right time. That\xe2\x80\x99s often how things go in baseball, and in terms of wins and losses the benefactor was Brian Matusz who took home the win. Texas would tack on a run in the last of the ninth against Preston Guilmet (on a sac fly), however Oriole bats were the dominant factor in the game \xe2\x80\x93 headlined of course by Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s shot.The series continues tonight with Bud Norris taking to the mound for the Birds once again in the state of Texas.

However, that might change after this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 MLB Draft. Ryan Ripken, son of the \xe2\x80\x9cIron Man,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0has entered his name into the Draft this year in hopes to be drafted.Everyone who considers themselves an Orioles fan has seen Cal Ripken\xe2\x80\x98s son even if they do not know they did.Recall back to when Cal broke Lou Gehrig\xe2\x80\x99s consecutive game record on September 6, 1995. If you can recall when Cal came out of the dugout to celebrate the moment with his wife and two kids. His little boy who he picked up and embraced (see below) was Ryan at the age of two.Following his father\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps, Ryan is trying to make it into the big leagues. Although he was in fact drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 2012 MLB Draft in the 20th round, Ryan decided to opt out and take the scholarship to play collegiate baseball that was given to him by the University of South Carolina.\xc2\xa0Unfortunately for the young Ripken, he did not get any playing time that first year due to being redshirted as a freshman. Wanting more playing time, he transferred after his freshman year to a junior college in Florida where he was guaranteed more playing time in order to showcase his skills to potential scouts who were keeping their eye on the promising first baseman.In his first full season of college ball, Ripken maintained a .321 batting average over 42 games played in 2014. He also batted in 24 runs and hit one home run with Indian River State College.Ripken\xe2\x80\x99s best game came on April 24th against Broward College. He went 4-5 on the day with two doubles and scored five runs in the game (which in fact were all of the team\xe2\x80\x99s runs scored that day).Even though none of his numbers put him on a pedestal as one of the top junior college prospects, Baseball America acknowledged back in February that he was the \xe2\x80\x9cbiggest name in junior college baseball.\xe2\x80\x9dWhether or not his name will help him get drafted remains to be seen. Having another Ripken play for the Orioles is certainly a cool thing to think about. If Ripken would make it up to the Major League level, he would increase ticket sales by just being on the active roster.There are some other teams who are interested in drafting the 20-year-old. One of these teams is the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Battle of the Beltways rival, the Nationals. It has been noted the Nationals general manager and Cal are close. However, no relationship can be closer to Cal than his relationship he has made with the city of Baltimore since being drafted by the Orioles in 1978.Will Ryan be the fourth Ripken to wear an Orioles uniform? Time will tell, but, with that being said, the name Ripken does not look good on any baseball uniform besides one that has the word \xe2\x80\x9cOrioles\xe2\x80\x9d across the chest.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles do not have a draft pick until the third round of this year\xe2\x80\x99s MLB Draft. Many people think because the Orioles do not have a pick in the first or second round, they do not have a good chance in drafting top-quality talent. However, in 1973, the Orioles drafted a first baseman out of the California State University, Los Angeles; and he proved to be a \xe2\x80\x9cnot so bad\xe2\x80\x9d pick for Baltimore in the proceeding years.This first baseman\xe2\x80\x99s name was Eddie Murray. In the 1973 MLB Draft, 62 players were selected before it was the Orioles turn to draft in the third round. In the two previous rounds, the Orioles drafted Mike Parrott\xc2\xa0(first round) and Jerry Guinn\xc2\xa0(second round).Parrott ended up playing five years in the Majors with a career 4.87 ERA.\xc2\xa0He made his Major League debut in 1977 with the Baltimore Orioles. He only pitched in three games wearing a Baltimore uniform however. On December 7, 1977, he was traded away to the Mariners where he held a 19-39 record in four years before he played his last Major League game at the age of 26 in 1981.Guinn never made it to the Major League level. He pitched two years for the Bluefield Orioles where he posted a 6.40 ERA in 104.0 innings pitched before giving up on his baseball dreams.However, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 third round draft choice turned out to be a \xe2\x80\x9cHall of Fame-caliber\xe2\x80\x9d pick.Murray made his debut with the Orioles in 1977. That year he hit 27 home runs, drove in 88 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s, and maintained a .283 batting average; all of which helped him win the American League Rookie of the Year Award that year.In the following years of his career, he proved to everyone that his first year in the Majors was not a fluke.Murray was one of the first switch hitters in the game of baseball who could hit and who could hit with power. And on September 6th, 1996, this statement was proven as fact when Murray crushed his 500th career home run in front of the home crowd at Camden Yards. This home run not only tied the game up at 3, but it also put Murray into a very elite group of ball players who could say they hit 500 home runs in their Major League career.  Murray has the third-most grand slams in Major League Baseball history with 19 total. Murray became a World Champion when he helped the Orioles win their third World Series title in 1983.In 13 years of playing in a Baltimore uniform, Murray was named to the American League All Star Team seven times. He won the Gold Glove Award three times and the Silver Slugger Award twice.When Murray\xe2\x80\x99s playing career in Baltimore came to an end, he finished with 2,080 hits (Orioles 3rd all-time), 1,084 runs (Orioles 3rd all-time), 343 home runs (Orioles 2nd all-time), and 1,224 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s (Orioles 3rd all-time).These numbers along with the numbers he acquired playing with the Dodgers, Mets, Indians, and Angels helped him reach his rightful spot in Cooperstown, New York as a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2003.That being said everyone should get excited when it is the Orioles turn to draft tomorrow in the third round because there may be another future Hall of Famer out there when the 90th overall pick rolls around.

Also, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe but if the season ended today the Orioles would be going to the playoffs. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of baseball left to play, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a good position to be in heading into June. With 57 games behind them the Orioles have seen the entire range of production from different players. Now with a little over a month left before the All-Star game, which players\xc2\xa0 will be rewarded with a trip to Target Field on July 15?Nelson Cruz is the obvious first to mention. His 21 homeruns and 55 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s have carried\xc2\xa0the club through a streak that saw several other players not playing up to their ability. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a question whether Cruz will be an all-star. The question the Orioles should be asking themselves is when they should start trying to extend him past this season. Cruz was a bargain at 8 million a year, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t be a bargain this offseason. The Orioles need to push for a long-term deal or they\xe2\x80\x99re going to see a lot of their offense walk away.Unless he completely falls apart in June, Zach Britton has to be an all-star. He has been the most valuable pitcher on the team, and one of the best relievers in all of baseball. He solidified a closer role that looked to be a major weakness in the first few weeks of the season. He\xe2\x80\x99s been dominate with an ERA of just 0.88, and opponents are only hitting .192 against him. Nobody probably would have predicted it in March, but Zach Britton will most likely be in the bullpen for the American League All-Stars.It\xe2\x80\x99s been lost a bit with all the attention Zach Britton has gotten, but Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day has quietly been dominant all season. In 24 innings this season O\xe2\x80\x99Day has 0.75 ERA, and in that time he\xe2\x80\x99s given up only two runs both on solo homers. He still dominates righties, but this season he has a 1.29 ERA against left-handers. If he keeps throwing this well he\xe2\x80\x99ll join Britton in Minnesota for his first All-Star game appearance.Adam Jones and Nick Markakis could both make the team if their production continues through June. Markakis is hitting .308 which is 9th in the American League, and also has an OBP of .366 which is 7th among outfielders. Adam Jones is hitting .296 which is good for 16th in the AL, and has also added 20 extra-base hits. His power numbers have been down this season so Jones could have a surge in power coming sometime soon.Orioles fans have seen in the past that it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to vote Orioles players in over the some of the larger market teams. However, with this talented of a roster it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say Baltimore will be well represented regardless. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

As the pick was announced on the MLB.com coverage, Jonathan Mayo described him as a ""one-trick guy, but what a trick."" I may have heard wrong, but I think he said something about a high-90s fastball. That sounds like a reliever waiting to happen.    A Perfect Game report from earlier in the spring noted Scott\'s velocity was 92-95 as a starter and that\xc2\xa0he touched 97 in relief. Wait a second, what kind of lefty is allowed to throw 97? This is the fourth pitcher the Orioles have taken in the draft. They have only had four picks so far. Scott is listed at 6\'2"" and 235 lbs. He is ranked as the #184 prospect on the Baseball America 500, meaning the O\'s have now picked three straight players who were ranked higher than their top overall pick. Scott had been planning to transfer to Texas Tech to join their baseball program in the fall, but perhaps those plans will be scuttled now in favor of joining the professional ranks.    The slot value for this pick is a cool $240,000. In ancient Orioles draft history, the Orioles once picked Mike Boddicker in the sixth round in 1978. They picked the immortal Mark Brown in the sixth round in 1980. More recent sixth rounders include Erik Bedard (1999), two-time World Series champion Eli Whiteside (2001), and, uh, Jason Berken (2006). Last year, they picked Calvert Hall catcher Alex Murphy in the sixth round.

When their turn finally came up for the first time on Friday afternoon, they dipped into the high school ranks to take a left-handed pitcher, Brian Gonzalez, from Archbishop McCarthy High School in Florida.    Gonzalez was rated as the #386 prospect on the Baseball America 500, which is, uh... well, the Orioles obviously like him. Another interesting thing is that Gonzalez is listed by BA as a first baseman, but the Orioles drafted him as a lefty. He is not so obscure that he has never been captured on video. Here is a little\xc2\xa0montage of Gonzalez highlights, which also features a sick guitar riff from Hades. He is listed at 6\'3"" and 230 lbs, according to\xc2\xa0Perfect Game USA. That\'s a pretty big dude. Whatever the Orioles see in him, the prospect-industrial complex at large seems to disagree. Then again, last year\'s first-round pick, Hunter Harvey, was a player who quickly proved to be better than his draft slot. It\'s a bit harder to pull that player out of your hat at #90 overall, but maybe there\'s something they like about him that they think they can develop. As a high school player, there\'s certainly room to polish him. Gonzalez is reportedly committed to the University of Miami. In his senior season at Archbishop McCarthy, he threw 69.1 innings with a 0.50 ERA and 129 strikeouts. In a place like Florida, that doesn\'t suck.    The slot value for this pick is $594,200.

Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 1 IP, 6 H, 5 R, 3 BB, 1 K. In a nutshell, Tillman struggled to get strike one against most hitters. Those hitters would then turn around and end up with lengthy at-bats, which drove up Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s pitch count.Texas jumped on Tillman early by putting up two runs in the first inning off of an RBI-single by Mitch Moreland. Michael Choice would shoot a two-run homer into the seats an inning later, and Elvis Andrus would tack on an RBI-single. That chased Tillman and Buck Showalter called for Brad Bach out of the \xe2\x80\x98pen.However there are two ways to look at being down that big so early; one is that you wonder how many more runs the opponent might score in the seven or eight innings left in the game. The second is to convince yourself that you yourself have plenty of time to come back in the game. Luckily for the Baltimore Orioles, they chose the latter option last night.The Orioles chipped away in the third when Nick Markakis followed a David Lough double with a two-run homer. That put the O\xe2\x80\x99s back in the game, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until the fifth that they started to take over control of it.

The unsung hero of last night\xe2\x80\x99s game was reliever Brad Brach, who held things right where they were for 3.1 innings. Unfortunately for Brach that might also signal a trip back to the minors (since he has options), as the O\xe2\x80\x99s might have to make another roster move due to the bullpen being taxed before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game. As for Tillman, the questions continue to mount regarding his health. Both he and Showalter claim that he\xe2\x80\x99s healthy; fans should have no reason to believe otherwise, especially considering that the Texas humidity has humbled many decent pitchers.  The Orioles might have to make a roster move today to call up a fresh reliever after using five bullpen pitchers last night. We also saw a rarity last night in that J.J. Hardy committed three errors in the field. Chalk that up once again to\xc2\xa0it happens. However that unfortunately helped Texas to re-take the lead in the seventh, as Odor reached second after an infield single and an error by Hardy. Elvis Andrus also reached first base on a Hardy error, which allowed Odor to score and give Texas a 6-5 lead. Texas would add two further RBI-singles in the inning, which left the O\xe2\x80\x99s down 8-5.Courtesy of Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY SportsThe O\xe2\x80\x99s would attempt to make a comeback as Adam Jones homered in the top of the eighth, cutting the Texas lead to 8-6.

06/07/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: MLB Draft Summary for 2014', 'There was less draft enthusiasm for Baltimore Orioles fans this year than in any other in recent memory. This is the cost of signing free agents who had been given the qualifying offer, though O\xe2\x80\x99s fans will say that the early returns on the Nelson Cruz signing seem very much worth this cost. The jury is still out on a final judgment relative to Ubaldo Jimenez.The first selection for the Orioles would not come until the 90th pick overall. Like many other teams, the Birds were shopping for pitching. As with Matt Hobgood in 2009, Dylan Bundy in 2011, and Hunter Harvey in 2013, the Baltimore Orioles would select a pitcher for their first choice (this year in round three). In fact, the first five picks for the Orioles would be pitchers on this day.Round Three \xe2\x80\x93 LHP \xe2\x80\x93 Brian Gonzalez \xe2\x80\x93 Archbishop McCarthy HS, Ft. Lauderdale, FL Gonzalez is 6-1, 230 and throws, at age 18, into the low 90s. He excels as a control specialist as well, being truly more pitcher than raw thrower. Gonzalez comes from an elite program, having former MLB pitcher Alex Fernandez leading the baseball program at his high school.Though Gonzalez has a commitment to the University of Miami, it is believed he is very signable and anxious to begin his pro career.Round Four \xe2\x80\x93 RHP \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0Pat Connaughton\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 Notre DameAs a two sport athlete, Connaughton is also a big part of the basketball program at Notre Dame. A hard thrower, there are certain inconsistencies in his performance that are credited to the lack of singular focus upon baseball. He will be involved in extended baseball activities this summer, will finish one more year of basketball, and then dedicate fully to a baseball career.Round Five \xe2\x80\x93 RHP \xe2\x80\x93 David Hess \xe2\x80\x93 Tennessee TechAs a big power-throwing right-hander, Hess was 10-3 with a 3.24 ERA this year. He is a strikeout pitcher with a collection of plus pitches besides the fastball \xe2\x80\x93 changeup, curve, slider. Though he has another year of eligibility remaining, he will be signing with the Orioles.Round Six \xe2\x80\x93 LHP \xe2\x80\x93 Tanner Scott \xe2\x80\x93 Howard College, TXScott stands 6-2, 220 and was 7-4 with a 2.66 ERA this season. He has committed to Texas Tech, so it is not certain he\xe2\x80\x99ll sign with the Birds.Round Seven \xe2\x80\x93 LHP \xe2\x80\x93 Max Schuh \xe2\x80\x93 UCLA Schuh is a relief pitcher who stands 6-4, 210. He was a part of the UCLA football program as a quarterback, though never played in any games. Schuh posted a 1.55 ERA for the 2014 season.Round Eight \xe2\x80\x93 2B \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Wilkerson \xe2\x80\x93 Clemson A switch-hitting infielder, Wilkerson batted .317 this year with strong power numbers that included six homers. He also possesses good speed.Round Nine \xe2\x80\x93 3B \xe2\x80\x93 Austin Anderson \xe2\x80\x93 U. of Mississippi This left-handed batting infielder is having a great season that is still continuing with the college playoffs. He is hitting in the .330s or so with strong power numbers. He is finishing his senior season and looks ready to move on successfully.Round Ten \xe2\x80\x93 OF \xe2\x80\x93 Jay Gonzalez \xe2\x80\x93 University of Mount Olive, NCThe second Gonzalez selected on the first day of the draft, this one is a different sort of player with great speed and 51 stolen bases. He also batted .425, though it should be noted that this is a Division II school. He has been drafted twice before and also played earlier at Auburn, where he was suspended.Rounds 11-40The remaining rounds of the draft for the Baltimore Orioles were not surprisingly pitcher-dominated. Of these 30 picks, the Birds selected 18 RHPs and 4 LHPs, 2 CFs, 2 RFs, and one each of the four infield positions.An interesting pick for the Orioles was Brandon Bonilla \xe2\x80\x93 the son of former MLB star Bobby Bonilla (who played more than a year for the O\xe2\x80\x99s). They took him in the 25th round. He is a 6-4, 215 pound left-handed pitcher from Grand Canyon University in Phoenix. A power thrower, he has hit as high as 97 mph, while also throwing a splitter and slider.The Orioles selected a local high school right-handed pitcher in the 34th round by taking Garrett Pearson (of St. John\xe2\x80\x99s College HS) who is 6-6, 215. He is from Rockville and has an over-the-top style of delivery \xe2\x80\xa6 fastball only in the mid 80s, but he\xe2\x80\x99s a big guy who can maybe develop.Also of interest is that the Nationals selected Cal Ripken\xe2\x80\x99s son Ryan in the 15th round. The left-hand first baseman had originally gone to the U. of South Carolina, but he transferred to Indian River State College where he posted a .321 average this season.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles had just about everyone on the team contribute in some form or fashion to an 11-inning loss to the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s Friday evening.In one sense the series opener was a fascinating game, as multiple, potential game-changing plays were decided by fractions of inches and fractions of seconds. Yet it was terribly frustrating for the Orioles, as most of the close calls went against them.In the end, Oakland pulled out a 4-3 win in 11 innings, wasting a quality start from Wei-Yin Chen who gave up only two runs on solo homers in his 6.1 innings. His pitches had decent movement and excellent velocity.The Baltimore Orioles did come back from a 2-0 deficit to take a 3-2 lead. A trio of singles by J.J. Hardy, Steve Pearce, and Jonathan Schoop scored their first run in the second inning. Chris Davis tied the game with a homer in the fourth, and Manny Machado gave the Birds a lead with a solo shot in the fifth inning. But that would be it for scoing, even though the Orioles did manage 13 hits in the 11 innings.The tying run was given up in uncharacteristic fashion, as Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day walked leadoff hitter Coco Crisp \xe2\x80\x93 a thorn in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 side for what seems like the past 30 years. Crisp would steal second where Yoenis Cespedes would score him on a double into the left-field corner.The best chance for the Orioles to win the game was in the 10th inning. With one out and Nick Markakis on second and Nelson Cruz on first, Adam Jones drove a single into right field. Markakis was thrown out in a play close enough to be challenged \xe2\x80\x93 though unsuccessfully. Should he have been sent with Davis on deck? I think so; it was worth the shot at winning the game. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been very critical of Dickerson\xe2\x80\x99s coaching and choices this year, but it was a legitimate good chance to win the game right there.The next play raises another question. With two out and Nelson Cruz on third base (and two strikes on Davis), Cruz attempted to steal home and was thrown out at the plate. I wrote in May about being at an Orioles game and how, in person, the over-shift against a left-handed pull hitter leaves a runner at third so free to get a huge lead. I opined then that someone should seek to take advantage of this. However, Cruz was actually not that much farther off the base than in a typical situation when he broke for the plate. So I believe the idea was a good one, but it simply was not executed in a way that would yield success.The Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s scored the game-winning running in the top of the 11th off Evan Meek \xe2\x80\x93 who does not seem to have \xe2\x80\x9cplus stuff\xe2\x80\x9d whatsoever these days. John Jaso doubled to lead off the inning on a ball where Adam Jones fell down before fielding and making the throw on a close play at second base.After a strikeout, Albert Callaspo hit a sharp grounder to J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s glove side. Hardy committed his fourth error in two days, as he clearly lifted his head before fielding the ball \xe2\x80\x93 looking to possibly make a play at third, which may well have been successful if he came up with it cleanly. Steven Vogt singled in the go-ahead run, breaking the O\xe2\x80\x99s back \xe2\x80\x93 as Davis, Hardy, and Pearce struck out in order in the bottom of the 11th.Did the difficult travel schedule and odd sleep patterns contribute to the loss? Would the fractional plays have gone the other way with a more rested team? The early season has been a grind if it has been anything, and the Orioles drop to 30-29 while the Jays win yet another game.Weird, weird season!Speaking of weird, another odd moment happened when Manny Machado took severe offense to the way he was tagged out at third base by the A\xe2\x80\x99s Josh Donaldson. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t see why Manny was that angry, as he was trying to get away from the tag and Donaldson was trying to put it on him. Machado fell backwards, throwing his helmet, and standing to get into Donaldson\xe2\x80\x99s face.Apparently Manny saw his own action as \xe2\x80\x9cgiving himself up\xe2\x80\x9d a bit more than Donaldson did, who seemed genuinely shocked that Machado was up in his face. Benches cleared, etc\xe2\x80\xa6 though the whole thing de-escalated quickly.More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryI don\xe2\x80\x99t fault the passion of Manny nor the fire to get into another\xe2\x80\x99s guy\xe2\x80\x99s face, even though I\xe2\x80\x99ve never really seen much of that fervor or attitude in him before. Actually, I like it. I often wish more of the mellow personalities on the Baltimore Orioles displayed more of this aggressiveness. I just think there was more smoke than fire in the actual precipitating incident.Donaldson was hit with an inside pitch by Chen in the top of the sixth inning. Though he threw some equipment in the air in disgust, again, smoke without a fire. It was the eighth pitch of the at-bat and was on a full count. Sometimes toward the end of the day for Chen, he loses his pinpointing abilities. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say he \xe2\x80\x9ctires\xe2\x80\x9d because, of those eight pitches to Donaldson, five were 94 MPH, one was 95 (the final pitch), and one was at 96.All in all, a frustrating loss, and the Orioles need to turn it around today \xe2\x80\xa6 check back for a preview and some other thoughts on the draft and Johan Santana. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles drop a game of inches - Birds Watcher', 'Be it cliche or not, all sports are games of inches. Perhaps this is most evident in football where you need ten yards to get a first down. However baseball is a game of inches also, and often times if you\xe2\x80\x99re off by one inch you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get beat. That can be taken literally or figuratively, but you get the idea. The Baltimore Orioles fell in game one of three to Oakland last night, 4-3 in 11 innings. Orioles fans can take solace in the fact that they battled with one of the best teams in baseball, however there\xe2\x80\x99s little solace in losing.Wei-Yin Chen started out a bit rocky \xe2\x80\x93 or did he? Certainly you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give up solo home runs, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to give up homers it\xe2\x80\x99s best to do it with nobody on base. Josh Donaldson smacked one out in the first inning, and Derek Norris followed suit in the second. That put the O\xe2\x80\x99s in a 2-0 hole, but other than that Chen managed to shut Oakland down. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.1 IP, 5 H, 2 R, 0 BB, 4 K. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s a fly ball pitcher who pitches-to-contact. So in that sense the two homers, zero walks, and only four strikeouts aren\xe2\x80\x99t surprising.This game wasn\xe2\x80\x99t without it\xe2\x80\x99s drama, however. Adam Jones grounded into a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice tCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportso end the third, and Oakland third baseman Josh Donaldson tagged Manny Machado out between second and third. However Machado took exception to what he deemed an overly hard tag, which admittedly sent him sprawling onto his backside. As he fell Machado slammed his helmet into the infield grass, and immediately got up and confronted Donaldson.Both benches and bullpens emptied, however order was quickly restored. My personal opinion was that while Donaldson did seem to go out of his way (and out of the base line) to tag Machado, the tag itself did not appear to be overly harsh.\xc2\xa0Ultimately, Wei-Yin Chen pitched Donaldson inside once and then hit him later in the at-bat later in the game \xe2\x80\x93 more to come, I suppose.Jonathan Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single in the second inning brought the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within 2-1, and Chris Davis tied the score at two in the fourth with a solo homer. Speaking of Manny Machado, he put the Birds in the drivers seat an inning later with a solo home run of his own. This of course followed a gold glove play at the hot corner in which Machado gunned down Derek Norris at first base in the fourth inning. Do we think that the incident with Donaldson didn\xe2\x80\x99t somehow fire Machado up?!With the Baltimore Orioles still leading 3-2, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day walked Coco Crisp to lead off the eighth.  \xe2\x80\x9cNothing good ever happens after a walk.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Rick Dempsey  Following a stolen base, Crisp would score to tie the game at three on a Cespedes RBI-double. J.J. Hardy would commit his fourth error in two days in the 11th, putting runners at the corners for Oakland. John Jaso scored on a Vogt RBI-single to left field, which ended up winning the game for Oakland.It\xe2\x80\x99s a game of inches; if not for that Hardy error perhaps Oakland ends up with runners at first and second and Jaso can\xe2\x80\x99t score on that single. Maybe he scores anyways; we have no way of knowing. If Chen doesn\xe2\x80\x99t miss his mark on one of those two home run pitches by an inch or so, maybe the ball doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave the ballpark. Again, we have no way of knowing.Perhaps the most bizzare play of the night came with two outs in the last of the tenth; the O\xe2\x80\x99s had Cruz at third and Adam Jones at second \xe2\x80\x93 with Chris Davis at the plate. On a two-strike count, Cruz was tagged out trying to steal home. Again, game of inches\xe2\x80\xa6right? A lot of folks had a problem with the attempted steal in that it takes the bat out of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 hands. However keep in mind that lady luck often smiles on daring ones. If nothing else, the Orioles are a pretty conventional team. Yet they play in an age where it seems that the unconventional is what\xe2\x80\x99s winning games. In that situation the last thing anyone would have expected would have been an attempted steal of home plate.Most second-guessing is done in all things based on results. So if Cruz is safe at home (ending the game), nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to say\xc2\xa0why in the world would he do that?\xc2\xa0Here\xe2\x80\x99s another thing; Josh Donaldson appeared to be giving Cruz one heck of a lead at third base. If anything, Cruz might have been able to get down the line further before he actually broke. While it does appear that the decision to steal was Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat opaque at the moment. So let\xe2\x80\x99s say that the steal sign was put on from the bench \xe2\x80\x93 did Oakland pick off that sign by chance?The series continues tonight in a game that will be televised by FOX at 7:15. The Birds had to send starter Miguel Gonzalez to the DL yesterday with soreness, so Kevin Gausman joined the team yesterday and will be activated to make tonight\xe2\x80\x99s start. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s Sonny Black.The Orioles also announced yesterday that Johan Santana\xe2\x80\x99s season is over. In what was to be his final extended-spring game (before being assigned to an affiliate for rehab), Santana tore his achilles tendon fielding a ball off the pitchers mound in Sarasota. Tough break for a guy that was hoping to make a comeback. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

06/09/2014,"[('Orioles Fans Weigh In On Machado Bat-Throwing Incident ...', ' BALTIMORE (WJZ) \xe2\x80\x94 Two inside pitches and a baseball bat flew down the third base line. Orioles fans are wondering whether Manny Machado threw his bat in anger or by accident. Jessica Kartalija reports fans are weighing in after not one, but two incidents involving the third baseman in the same series. The move by fan favorite Manny Machado cleared the benches and got him and Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s pitcher Fernando Abad thrown out of the game. Machado says it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t intentional. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bat slipped out of my hands trying to make contact, and the umpire thought it was intentional,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The hostility between players started Friday when Machado became angry with the way A\xe2\x80\x99s player Josh Donaldson tagged him on an infield groundout. Machado threw his helmet on the ground and confronted the third baseman. Fans called into WJZ\xe2\x80\x99s own Rob Long and Vinny Cerrato on 105.7 The Fan to talk about the throw that got him thrown out. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he charges the mound, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably more acceptable than throwing a bat,\xe2\x80\x9d said one. \xe2\x80\x9cThen he tosses the bat and his aim was off. It went to third instead of going to the pitcher,\xe2\x80\x9d another said. Machado, 21, insisted the bat slipped out of his hands but the umpire disagreed and Machado was ejected. Opinions are mixed about the incident. \xe2\x80\x9cI would think that it was done intentionally, just out of anger. I would probably do the same thing, just like any other baseball player,\xe2\x80\x9d said a fan. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s got more class than that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think for one second that he would let his emotions overcome him that badly. He\xe2\x80\x99s a professional. I give him the benefit of the doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d another fan said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it was intentional. It was a slight overreaction. Maybe he should have kept his composure because people are watching and maybe it would ignite more bad behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d a third fan said. Machado could face suspension from the league for throwing the bat. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear what will happen next.

The Athletics won 11-1. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe word has come down from Major League Baseball that Baltimore Orioles third baseman Manny Machado will be suspended for five games for the Sunday afternoon bat throwing incident against the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s. There will also be an undisclosed fine.The announcement was made by Senior Vice President for Standards and Operations for Major League Baseball, Joe Garagiola, Jr.Oakland pitcher Fernando Abad also received an undisclosed fine for throwing at Machado.The entire situation and furor that followed it from all over baseball and the sports world pretty much assured or demanded something of this nature. It all seemed very much out of character for the Manny that we as O\xe2\x80\x99s fans have seen over his brief time in the Bigs. In fact, the primary viewpoint has been to marvel at how well he has handled all that has come to him in such a short time and at such a young age.The appearance is that a lot of \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d has built up in him and it all came out in one small window of time. There is the \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d of the injury and surgery, the winter of recovery and work, and the return that has been a grind without the obvious high-level results of a year ago.So how will the Orioles play without him? Well, one would assume that Ryan Flaherty would take the position for this time with Jonathan Schoop at second base. It is likely that Steve Lombardozzi will also be called up from AAA Norfolk.However, later breaking news is that this will be appealed, and therefore the process would be delayed for any actual suspended time \xe2\x80\x93 whatever amount of time that may be. \xc2\xa0Machado is playing this evening for the Orioles in his normal spot \xe2\x80\x93 second in the order.I will opine that an appeal will not help the situation and Manny\xe2\x80\x99s reputation moving forward \xe2\x80\x93 better to take it and put it behind. Perhaps the much lesser punishment to Abad is a sticking point? The Orioles do lose a player for the duration of the suspension, and that is an issue of course.Frankly, Manny\xe2\x80\x99s play both in the field and at the plate has not been what it was in 2013 nor what it will be in 2015. With Machado in the lineup, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are 18-17, without him they are 14-13. This is manageable; but the Orioles do want to see Manny Machado get back to Manny being Manny \xe2\x80\x93 and that is not a reference to a previous Manny of the dreadlock variety.For an article on previous bat-throwing incidents and punitive actions related to such \xe2\x80\x93 along with a video of Manny reflecting on the situation \xe2\x80\x93 check this article and video from the Baltimore Sun.\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Get to know your Orioles: Kevin Gausman - Camden Chat', ' With the fourth pick in the 2012 draft, the Baltimore Orioles selected the latest in the long line of anointed ""future aces"".

His high school days were pretty much what one would expect from a wunderkind like Gasuman. He was an all-state selection twice, an Under Armour All-American and an AFLAC All-American; both in 2009. The guy was a stone cold stud.    At this time he was developing some rituals that have stayed with him. For example, he didn\'t have a locker room at Grandview so he had to get dressed on the go. He says, this led to the way he puts his socks on today. Let\'s just say, it\'s a laborious process. He will put on his right sock and take it off. Water break. He then returns to the sock and puts it on his right foot again. This time it stays on. Water break. Back to the socks where he now puts on his left one and immediately removes it. Water break. Then, he comes back and puts on the second sock. Woo! I don\'t want to know his process for putting on underwear.    Something that was widely publicized, but seems to be a thing of the past now, was his love for powdered donuts. He would have one before a start and then eat four between each inning of his starts. I feel bloated just typing that. However, he says he has kind of gotten away from that. That\'s probably for the better. And the final strange thing he has done in the past, but I am unsure if he does now, is that he began his warmups before an inning by sprinting towards the rubber, jumping, and throwing a fastball towards the catcher. What can ya say, he\'s a pitcher.    After high school he was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the sixth round of the 2010 draft. He declined and, instead, enrolled at Louisiana State University. While at LSU he wowed with his mid-90s fastball and above average off-speed stuff, drawing comparisons to former Oriole, and LSU Tiger, Ben McDonald. Gausman won numerous awards as a member of the Tigers, including a 2012 All-SEC and All-American selection. Another good thing for Gausman to come out of his time in Louisiana is his relationship with his girlfriend, Taylor North. It seems the two have been together for sometime now. She is an LSU cheerleader and is Goose\'s biggest fan. Look to her twitter feed for any off-field Gausman updates as the two are regularly together, even during the season.*    Favorites   Food: Not powdered doughnuts. He actually loves hibachi, not a specific food, but the entire experience of watching the food be cooked right in front of you.  Movie: Napoleon Dynamite  Music: Michael Jackson and Alan Jackson (no relation, in case ya didn\'t know). However, his first ever walk-up song at Aberdeen was ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" by N\'Sync.  Hidden Talent: He is modest and says that he has no other talents. However, this fella did play some saxophone in middle school.  Career if not a baseball player: An historian. Gausman was a history major at LSU and he really likes that show ""Ancient Aliens"" on History Channel.   Vacation Spot: Turks and Caicos Islands  Baseball team growing up: Colorado Rockies   Baseball player: Randy Johnson   What\'s Ahead Everyone saw his stellar outing against Oakland on Saturday night. He went seven strong innings, allowing one run and showcasing his immense potential. However, he has struggled to string positive outings together. At times his fastball looks flat and his offspeed pitches lack any deception. But the Orioles have guaranteed the big righty one more start. He is set to take the hill on Thursday against Toronto, a hot hitting lineup with possibly the best power hitter in the game right now. It is going to be a true test of his mettle. Can he hack it against the big boppers of the AL East? We will soon find out. When it comes down to it, Gausman is definitely one of the top five most talented pitchers on the Orioles roster. If talent directly translated to wins he may even be the ace of the club. But the LSU alum still has a lot to prove. Before the season began, Gausman was tabbed as the X-factor. If he emerges as a fixture in the rotation then the O\'s have a shot to go deep into the postseason. As it sits now, there is more talk about who this team needs rather than who they have, but the powdered donut eating phenom has the power to change that and, make no mistake, he will be the number one starter of this staff soon enough.

They scored 34 runs and allowed 34.    Standings The Orioles are at 32-30, second place in the AL East, 5.5 games behind Toronto and one game ahead of the Yankees. Their predicted finish is 83-79. Best Hitter / Worst Hitter Adam Jones led the team, and indeed all of baseball, with a 301 wRC+ this week (.483/.500/.931, 4 HR). He even walked once!  J.J. Hardy didn't look so good though. He posted a 35 wRC+ (.192/.241/.269) and made several errors in the field. Best Pitcher / Worst Pitcher In the rotation, Kevin Gausman put together a great start during his second callup this season. In seven innings he struck out six and walked one, giving up just one run on a solo shot. And this was against a red-hot Oakland team that leads the major leagues un runs scored per game.    In the bullpen, Zach Britton continued his run of success on the year. In three innings he struck out four and walked one. He gave up three hits but no runs. More about him later.    Clutch PA of the Week Against Texas on June 4th, the Orioles entered the top of the sixth tied at 5. Jonathan Schoop singled against Nick Martinez and David Lough walked. Caleb Joseph tried to bunt the runners over, but he bunted back to the pitcher who was able to force Schoop at third base. One out. Ron Washington brought in Aaron Poreda to pitch to Nick Markakis. On the first pitch, Lough and Joseph went for the double steal; Joseph was safe, but Lough was thrown out at third. Two out. Markakis came through, singling into left field to bring Joseph home easily and putting the Orioles up 6-5. The score would stay there for the rest of the game. As a side note, Markakis is doing really well this year, hitting .312/.369/.431 with 6 HR (121 wRC+). Note that offense is down league-wide this year, so Markakis looks better by that comparison. He's relying on his highest BABIP since 2010, which doesn't bode well for his average, but his walk and strikeout rates remain better than average. It's a good sign that he already has six dingers on the year, more than halfway to last year's total of 10 in a little over 1/3 the games. And having his high OBP at the top of the lineup doesn't hurt.    Clutch Relief Appearance of the Week As you might expect, Zach Britton recorded this week's most clutch relief appearance. On June 6th against Oakland, he came into the game in the top of the 9th with the score knotted up at 3. He struck out Brandon Moss and got Alberto Callaspo and Kyle Blanks to ground out. The Orioles couldn't score, so in the 10th, he struck out Nick Punto before giving up a double to Coco Crisp. Jed Lowrie flew out to right field and Josh Donaldson walked to add some intrigue. But Yoenis Cespedes struck out and Orioles fans everywhere applauded (until Evan Meek came in the next inning, that is). For what it's worth, Britton also recorded this week's second-most clutch appearance (June 4th against Texas). He has been so good this year. Upcoming Week The Orioles finish the series against Boston, remain in Baltimore to host the scorching-hot Blue Jays, then begin a quick AL East road trip in Tampa Bay (well, technically St. Petersburg).

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsLooking back now at some of the deals that Baltimore Orioles Vice President of Baseball Operations Dan Duquette did NOT do in the offseason makes him look a bit smarter at this moment.Orioles fans will remember (or should remember) what an offseason of discontent it was until a flurry of moves were made at the very end for Suk-min Yoon, Ubaldo Jimenez, and Nelson Cruz.Beyond this was the criticism for the \xe2\x80\x9csalary dump\xe2\x80\x9d of Jim Johnson with little in return, the embarrassing situation with Grant Balfour, and the non-effort to even speak with Brian Roberts.You might say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re giving Duquette credit for Jimenez? That\xe2\x80\x99s been a disaster!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Well, yes\xe2\x80\xa6 but Cruz has been a bargain \xe2\x80\x93 there\xe2\x80\x99s that! So, let\xe2\x80\x99s break this all down a bit.The Jim Johnson Situation \xe2\x80\x93 The Johnson of 2012 was an awesome asset, contributing as much as anyone to the great playoffs year and Orioles revival. The Johnson of 2013, more than any other single factor, cost the O\xe2\x80\x99s a chance to return to the playoffs.I for one did not grieve his loss whatsoever. But many did, and a few still do. Really? You would want a $10-million guy with a 6.46 ERA and WHIP of 1.986? He is giving up 5.3 walks per nine innings. For perspective, Jimenez is at 5.1.He is a great, nice guy who was a part of the turnaround of the Orioles organization after years of losing. That is now history \xe2\x80\x93 appropriately.The Grant Balfour Situation \xe2\x80\x93 You can\xe2\x80\x99t make up stuff like this. Guess what Balfour\xe2\x80\x99s ERA is right now \xe2\x80\x93 6.46 \xe2\x80\xa6 the same as Johnson in the exact same number of innings and appearances. He has given up the unbelievable number of 7.6 walks per nine innings, though his WHIP is better than Johnson at 1.648.Joe Madden has announced that Balfour is no longer the closer \xe2\x80\xa6 that the team is going to use a closer by committee approach. Sunday, the Mariners scored five runs in the ninth inning off him.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireDuquette and the Orioles were excoriated in the national sports and baseball press for pulling back on a contract for unspecified medical concerns. Even many O\xe2\x80\x99s fans were critical of Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s handling of it. Would anyone now want Balfour and his $12-million two-year deal?The Brian Roberts Situation \xe2\x80\x93 Roberts ended up signing with the Evil Empire to replace the loss of Robinson Cano with at least a veteran presence. That is a tall order, but it has not really worked out extra well for the Yankees.A leading Yankees blog is calling to throw Roberts overboard. Mike Axisa of River Ave Blues says of Roberts, who is batting .239, \xe2\x80\x9cLike Jeter, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear Roberts isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to provide much with the bat. He had a little hot streak a few weeks ago but even then that only raised him up to a .690 OPS for the season, the highest it\xe2\x80\x99s been since the third game of the year. Unlike Jeter, the Yankees can replace Roberts.\xe2\x80\x9dAxisa also said of Roberts in his article, \xe2\x80\x9cSomehow he\xe2\x80\x99s stayed healthy so far.\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, that is an improvement over the recent past.The combined effort of the varied players at second base for the Orioles through 62 games is at a .248 average \xe2\x80\x93 not awesome, but in total at least as good as what Roberts would have done. And this includes six homers, as compared to two by BRob.The Ubaldo Jimenez Situation \xe2\x80\x93 Actually, this could be called the veteran pitcher situation. In the mix were offseason discussions of getting one of the trio of A.J. Burnett, Bronson Arroyo, or Jimenez.Arroyo is 5-4 with a 4.50 ERA. He has pitched only four more innings than Jimenez, but has given up 14 more hits. Yes, there are far fewer walks. But Arroyo is far from lights out.Burnett is 3-4 with a 4.41 ERA. However, his walks per nine innings are almost as high as Ubaldo\xe2\x80\x99s. And Burnett has a 7.25 ERA over his past six starts.There is no doubt that Jimenez has had a rather poor first two months with the Orioles. Yet at the same time, there is no doubt that his stuff is nasty when commanded well. And that is the problem, for sure. If he can cut down on these walks and repeat his delivery \xe2\x80\x93 which I believe he will at some point \xe2\x80\x93 this is going to be a tough pitcher.Jimenez has vastly more upside potential than the other two options. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure he is worth the price, and I wrote that at the moment it happened \xe2\x80\x93 he is not now, and never has been, a person who can control pitch counts regularly and go deep into games. That was supposed to be the goal of getting a front-line starter \xe2\x80\x93 to obtain an innings-eater pitcher.Buyer\xe2\x80\x99s remorse aside, he will prove to be no worse than the other options and will likely prove to be better. This is the problem of free agent pitchers not named Tanaka.So, all in all, I know it is the thing to do in Baltimore to be critical of Dan Duquette. He is not going to be perfect, but I believe that objectively considered, he has done a decent job with the resources available. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

It has been almost a week since I have posted, but the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching is certainly on the upswing. In fact, if you take away the bad starts by their \xe2\x80\x98top pitchers,\xe2\x80\x99 Chris Tillman and Ubaldo Jimenez, the pitching has been very good.Kevin Gausman was not exactly economical with his pitch count, but he was pretty good once again. Orioles fans were a bit scared when Gausman took a hard drive off his hip, but he continued to keep hitters off balance.Buck Showalter once again makes a move that pays off. Delmon Young had great numbers against Mark Buehrle, and he came up in the first and struck immediately, hitting a fastball from the Jays\xe2\x80\x99 ace and depositing it in the left field seats on a line. This gave the Orioles a lead they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give back.The Orioles did quite well playing small ball in this game, picking up their other two runs that way.The Birds\xe2\x80\x99 defense once again played quite well behind Gausman and the \xe2\x80\x98pen. The double play in the first inning was a thing of beauty, as Chris Davis noticed the speedy Jose Reyes headed to third on a ball that was hit to Manny Machado, and threw back to third, with Manny getting back and making a great tag on Reyes.And of course, the O\xe2\x80\x99s end the game with a double play, because even though their defense has been a little worse than last year, it still has been spectacular.But before I close out the good \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0Nick Markakis. Nick singled in the first once again, scoring on the homer by Young. Markakis passed Brian Roberts for ninth all-time in hits for the Orioles when he later singled in a run.The BAD: The O\xe2\x80\x99s offense is not exactly hitting the cover off the ball right now, but with the pitching the way it is going, four runs will win a good amount of games. However, Chris Davis continues his Jekyll and Hyde performance, with a great game followed by one in which he struggles.What\xe2\x80\x99s NEXT: The Orioles will play Toronto for game 2 of the four-game series on Friday night, which is Fireworks Night at Camden Yards. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will send the struggling Ubaldo Jimenez to the mound (2-7, 5.01) against Jays\xe2\x80\x99 righty Drew Hutchison (4-4, 3.96).

But after Juan Francisco homered to put Toronto up 2-0 in the second inning, Jimenez did not give up another hit until Adam Lind singled off the right field wall with two outs in the sixth.His outing was a definite upgrade from his last start, when he yielded six runs in 2 1-3 innings against Oakland.""I had a rough game before this one, so this is a good sign to be able to be there for the team,"" Jimenez said.Hutchison allowed five hits over seven innings, struck out three, walked none and permitted only one runner past second base. The right-hander is 1-3 with an 8.72 ERA at home and 4-1 with a 1.79 ERA on the road.""It\'s just worked out that way so far. It\'s kind of one of those things,"" Hutchison said of his imbalanced record. ""I haven\'t had many starts at home, so that might be part of it. But the rest of that, I could really care less as long as we\'re going out there and giving the team a chance to win.""Especially against the Orioles. Hutchison is 2-0 with a 1.16 ERA in five career starts against Baltimore.""He\'s pretty good against some other people,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter noted.After Hutchison retired three straight batters in the seventh following a leadoff double by J.J. Hardy, a thunderstorm stopped play for 21 minutes.When play resumed, Toronto scored twice in the eighth off Tommy Hunter on a wild pitch and an RBI single by Jose Bautista.Blue Jays reliever Brett Cecil left with a groin injury in the eighth inning. He was replaced by Dustin McGowan, who got five outs for his first major league save.The victory snapped a three-game skid for the AL East-leading Blue Jays, who had lost five of six while being outscored 29-9.""I felt like it was the toughest game to win all year, if you want to know the truth,"" Toronto manager John Gibbons said. ""We didn\'t get many hits. We got the big home run, and of course we scratched out a couple late.""Manny Machado had three hits for Baltimore, but the Orioles stranded nine and went 1 for 11 with runners in scoring position.The Blue Jays put runners on the corners with no outs in the first inning before Jimenez worked out of trouble. In the second, however, Francisco delivered Toronto\'s major league leading 92nd home run after Brett Lawrie drew a walk.That ended the Jays\' run of four straight games without a homer and snapped Baltimore\'s streak of 43 innings without allowing a long ball. It also marked the first time in nine games that Toronto scored first.After Baltimore loaded the bases with two outs in the fourth, Jonathan Schoop hit a fly to the warning track in center field.Beginning with that out, Hutchison retired 10 of the final 11 batters he faced.NOTES: Orioles C Matt Wieters will have his ailing elbow examined by Dr. James Andrews on Monday, and season-ending surgery is a distinct possibility. ""I hope we get some good news Monday, but we better prepare if it\'s not,"" Showalter said. Wieters has not played since May 10. ... Bud Norris (3-1, 2.38 ERA at home) starts for the Orioles on Saturday against Toronto and right-hander R.A. Dickey. ... Showalter said Machado\'s suspension will not start this weekend, and it will likely go to the appeal process.

As we made our way through the various zoo exhibits, we would invariably end the day by going through the hippo house. It is the worst thing I have ever smelled, an enclosed space where the stench of hippos permeated completely. There was no skipping the trip in to the hippo house, because where else are you going to be in close proximity to a hippopotamus? You have to see the hippos while you can.    I mention all of this tonight because Ubaldo Jimenez is the pitching equivalent of hippopotamus shit. Sometimes I might go into the hippopotamus house and not be as offended by the smell as my worst memory, but still, at all times, I was fully aware that I was being buffeted by the smell of hippo in a controlled environment. In much the same way, there are days where you can watch Jimenez and he's less terrible than the worst you've seen him, but you still can't escape the basic fact that he is what he is. The big difference between the hippopotamus and Jimenez is that the hippo is this exotic creature from a distant, not-easily-accessible ecosystem, where Jimenez is just a pitcher who looks terrible. We have seen plenty of those pitchers and we do not care to see more. The Orioles lost Friday's game to the Blue Jays by a 4-0 score. They were never in the game, would never be in the game. The hitters turned in one of their trademark pathetic performances, this time against Jays starter Drew Hutchison. And then, on the other hand ... Jimenez.    If you didn't watch him, if you're only checking the box score, you might not be aware of how bad he looked. If you saw those hippos through glass, you would not know the smell, either. Jimenez only gave up two runs in six innings, which is, on a results-based level, not so bad. That is a quality start, and it is not the bare minimum, 4.50 ERA.    The reason for that is that Ubaldo is a lucky man. He plays on the team that has turned more double plays than any other team in baseball. With guys like Jimenez pitching, they get plenty of chances with a man on first. They turned two in support of Jimenez tonight. This is the kind of thing you need to happen when your starting pitcher walks five batters in six innings. How does that even happen? The Orioles hitters are lucky to get five walks in 60 innings. They had no walks tonight. It was the fourth start of the season where Jimenez has walked five batters. You have to work to get that outcome.    In retrospect, the game was over after Juan Francisco homered off Jimenez in the second inning, immediately following a one-out walk to Brett Lawrie. The Orioles never scored in the game, so 2-0 would have held for the night. More on that in a minute. Right after giving up that home run, Jimenez walked the next batter. Why does he hate us? The defense bailed him out with one of the double plays, but the damage was done. Jimenez gave up only three hits in his six innings. The five free passes hurt. Even when a good-hitting team like the Jays swings at Jimenez's offerings, they had a hard time putting it safely in play. It's just, the free passes. They hurt. As for the Orioles hitters, well, you're probably going to lose most of the time when you go 1-11 with runners in scoring position, which is precisely what they did tonight. The lone hit with RISP was an infield single by Manny Machado. No runs were coming in from second on that play. In a particularly frustrating sequence in the seventh inning, J.J. Hardy led off with a double and never advanced. Machado and Jonathan Schoop flew out by hacking at garbage on the first pitch. It hurts so much.    Adding to the night's misfortune was an appearance by Tommy Hunter, who was determined to show why he was kicked out of the closing role. Actually, he got one scoreless inning, but then came out for the next one and things did not go so well. Hunter issued a walk to Anthony Gose, who ended up on third after Hunter could not field a grounder by Jose Reyes. The error on the play actually was charged to Schoop, who couldn't field Hunter's half-hearted deflection, but whatever. Gose scored on a wild pitch, which moved Reyes up to second. Reyes moved up to third on a groundout, in position to easily score when Jose Bautista floated a single to center. That gets us to our 4-0 final score. The best scoring chance for the Orioles came in the fourth inning. Adam Jones led off with a single and moved up a base on a groundout. Unfortunately, Jones then delivered a TOOTBLAN (thrown out on the basepath like a nincompoop), taking off for third on a grounder to shortstop. Reyes threw to third, where Jones was tagged out. Maybe if he was on third, then Hardy would have still singled and scored him. Instead, the Orioles got nothing. Four Orioles batters had multi-hit games, including a three-hit effort by Machado, and two-hit games by Hardy, Jones, and Steve Pearce. Every time Pearce plays, you wonder why he doesn't play more. The problem for the Orioles was that every other Oriole had a no-hit game. That's a good recipe for getting shut out. The series is even up at one game apiece. They continue Saturday afternoon at 4:05, with Bud Norris starting for the Orioles against R.A. Dickey of the Jays. A plague fell upon the Orioles knuckleballers on Friday, with minor leaguer Eddie Gamboa being suspended 50 games for a positive PED test, and UMBC product Zach Clark being released. Maybe some of that bad knuckleballer juju will mean a poor performance for Dickey.    Please exit through the gift shop. A portion of the proceeds from every sale will go towards the preservation of good starting pitchers in their natural habitat.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

""I was probably out of the game after that next batter, anyway. I decided it was probably in everybody\'s best interest to just call it a day.""Toronto nearly got Dickey off the hook.In the seventh, Orioles reliever Darren O\'Day retired Melky Cabrera on a grounder with two outs and two on.

Hardy, who fired the relay to catcher Nick Hundley.""The big play in the game was obviously the relay throw,"" Davis said. ""That was a big hit for Encarnacion and a chance for them to get back into the game and get really good momentum in their dugout.""Lawrie followed with an RBI single.The Blue Jays stranded nine and went 1 for 6 with runners in scoring position.""This has been a tough run here so we need to hopefully regroup,"" Thole said. ""We\'re playing behind every night.""With the score 1-all in the fifth, Jones hit a grounder to third. The throw by Juan Francisco bounced past first base, and Jones lightly pushed umpire Hunter Wendelstedt while rounding the bag. The umpire toppled backward onto the infield dirt but was not hurt.Davis followed by hitting a 1-0 pitch over the center field wall and into the Baltimore bullpen.""We got burned by the home run ball,"" Toronto manager John Gibbons said.Earlier, Dickey got into trouble in the first inning when Nick Markakis led off with an infield hit and Machado doubled. But Jones, Davis and Cruz followed with popups.In the Toronto second, Norris hit Lawrie with a pitch before walking Thole with the bases loaded.Baltimore tied it in the fourth when Hundley delivered a sacrifice fly following singles by Delmon Young and Ryan Flaherty.NOTES: Toronto DH Adam Lind left with a bruised right foot. ...

Many skeptics are quick to point out that Oriole pitchers are barely qualifying for quality starts \xe2\x80\x93 Norris only pitched two outs past the necessary six innings. However throwing a quality start and then turning it over to the bullpen is how this game is supposed to work.Bud Norris did run into a bit of trouble in the second inning, however he minimized the damage and pitched out of it. Following two singles and a strikeout to start the inning (leaving runners at the corners) Norris loaded the bases by hitting Brett Lawrie with a pitch. He then walked in a run when Josh Thole drew a walk, and the Birds trailed 1-0. However Norris struck the next batter out and induced a ground out to end the threat.

With one out and Bautista on second base in the eighth, Toronto appeared to have brought themselves to within one on Juan Encarnacion\xe2\x80\x98s double. However Nelson Cruz relayed the ball quickly into J.J. Hardy, who threw home; catcher Nick Hundley applied the tag on Bautista, who was called out at home plate. Bautista immediately called for manager John Gibbons to challenge the play, however the umpires independently decided to review it. It was definitely a bang-bang play, and in my opinion one in which the call on the field should not have been overturned (regardless of whether it was safe or out).And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly how it went down, with the umpires upholding the out call.\xc2\xa0However as we found out moments after the call was confirmed, the umpires were actually reviewing the collision rule, ensuring that Hundley wasn\xe2\x80\x99t blocking the plate (which is now not allowed unless he has the ball). Replays seemed to back up the fact that he was not, and as I said above whether or not Bautista beat the throw or not was too close to overturn the call.Toronto would push a run across anyways later in the inning as Lawrie\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single would score Encarnacion. That really shows what a key moment that play involving Bautista was, as all things being the same the game would have been tied. J.J. Hardy was the unsung hero of the day in that sense, as he knew Bautista wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the best runner in the world and he called for the ball from Nelson Cruz because he knew he had a shot of nailing Bautista at home plate. Hardy threw a perfect strike home, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were able to take a lead into the ninth inning.Zach Britton was credited with the save, as he recorded a strikeout, a walk, and a double-play to end the game. With the win and the New York loss last night in Oakland, the Birds moved back into second place and within 3.5 games of Toronto.

One way to keep (#Team) Steve Clevenger off the basepaths is for him to get ejected. And that is what he did int he 5th inning of this game after being called out on strikes. The Tides' bats remained a'slumbering until the they managed to tie the game in the 8th. A single followed by an error followed by another single loaded the bases with none out. But one run was all they would manage thanks to a GIDP. The situation was similar in the 9th (bases loaded none out) but this time the Tides managed to squeeze 3 runs out of their rally and put the game out of reach. Buck Britton drove in 2 of those runs with a 2 out double. Francisco Peguero and Brett Wallace also had doubles on the day.    Harrisburg (Nats) 8 Bowie 4 Everyone in the Baysox starting lineup had at least one hit, but 3 GIDPs and a \xc2\xa02 for 9 performance with runners in scoring position limited them to just 4 runs. Nolan Reimold continued his rehab with a 1 for 4 night, with that 1 hit being a double. He would later try to score on a single by Christian Walker but would be thrown out at the plate. Christian Walker was 1 for 2 with 2 walks drawn. Dariel Alvarez added a 1 for 4 effort, and Michael Ohlman knocked two hits in his 4 at bats, but also committed a TOOTBLAN by getting doubled off first on a fly ball to CF. Starting pitcher Jake Petit was effective, going 6 inning while allowing 3 ER. But Chris Petrini let the game get away by giving up 5 ER in just a third of an inning. Myrtle Beach (Rangers) 1 Frederick 5 Brady Wager tossed 7 innings of 1 run ball for the Keys, holding the Pelicans to 6 hits and 2 walks. Matt Hobgood pitched a clean 9th, striking out 1. Glynn Davis put in his typical day, getting 1 hit in 4 at bats. Tucker Nathans and Michael Burgess did the bulk of the work for the Keys offense, combining for 5 hits in 8 at bats, including a double and a HR. Adrian Marin went 0 for 4 with 3 Ks. Delmarva 6 West Virginia (Pirates) 4 (Game 1/Final 7 innings) Have yourself a day, Mike Yastrzemski! 2 for 4 with a SB, both of his hits were solo HRs. Just needed an OF Assist to make the day complete, but alas...there were none to be had. Trey Mancini and Austin Wynns added 2 hits and an RBI each. Steven Brault cruised through 6 innings before running into a bit of trouble in the 7th. He left the game with one out in the 7th, having allowed just 4 hits and no runs while K'ing 7. Dylan Rheault came on in relief and allowed both inherited runners to score, along with two of his own.    Delmarva 14 West Virginia 5 (Game 2/Final 7 innings) As good as Yastrzemski looked in the first game, he looked equally bad in the 2nd: 0 for 5 with 4 Ks. ouch! He did, however, manage an Outfield Assist, doubling off a runner from 1st for a double play. So that's always cool. Chance Sisco is having a pretty great offensive season, bringing a 121 wRC+ into this game. That number went up after his 4 for 5, with 2 doubles performance. He drove in 4 and scored 2 twice himself. Conor Bierfeldt also drove in 4. He singled, doubled, and walked twice on the day. Drew Dosch went 3 for 4, got hit by a pitch, and scored 4 times. Trey Mancini was 1 for 3 with 2 walks drawn. Luis Gonzalez was the beneficiary of all that early run support, but he only managed 4 innings of work. He yielded 6 hits, 1 HBP, and 2 walks, but just 1 run.    Aberdeen 3 Hudson Valley (Tampa Bay) 4 (11 innings) Stephen Tarpley made his 2014 debut and scuffled a bit. Over 4 innings he allowed 6 hits, including 2 HRs, while striking out 4. 20 year old RHP Dariel Delgado got off to a fast start with 6 Ks over 3 scoreless innings of work. 2014 draftee Jay Gonzalez did his best Mike Yastrzemski impression by going 0 for 5 with 3 Ks while throwing out a runner from CF for an Outfield Assist. I'm very much enjoying all these strong arms in the outfield for the affiliates. Hector Veloz went 2 for 4 with a double, but also got picked off 2nd base. Middle-of-the-diamond duo (2B) Ronarsy Ledesma and (SS) Byron Capellan combined to go 4 for 9 with a double and a HR. The former just turned 21 in April while the latter is still only 20. DSL Rojos 5 DSL O'sUno 2 DSL O'sDos 4 DSL Yanquis 14 21 year old (SS) Richardo Andujar went 2 for 4 with a double and a stolen base. 18 year old (2B) Pedro Flores went 1 for 3 with 2 walks. Carlos Diaz went 3 for 5 in his game. 20 year old (INF) Sergio Lamas went 1 for 5 with a triple and 3 RBI. 19 year old (RF) Carlos Rodriguez went 3 for 5 and stole a base. 19 year old (CF) Carlos Jean recorded an Outfield Assist by doubling off a runner from 1st. 20 year old (RHP) Jose Rosario K'd 7 over 6 IP while allowing 3 runs (2 earned).

Additon has now allowed at least as many runs as innings pitched in his last three appearances. Brock Huntzinger and Kelvin De La Cruz were effective in relief shutting out the Chiefs the rest of the way. Huntzinger was nearly perfect, walking one and striking out five in three innings of work.    Francisco Peguero, Cord Phelps and Buck Britton doubled. The Tides could only manage a 1-9 night with RISP. Bowie Baysox 6, Harrisburg Senators 2 In the few games Nolan Reimold has played since beginning his rehabilitation assignment, he has demonstrated that his eye has not suffered in his time away from in game action. Reimold walked four times in today's game against the Senators, but is SLGing a mere .263 overall. The big bats of the Baysox weren't exactly on fire today as only Garabez Rosa managed an extra base hit, but that's okay, because on this day, his teammates were peppering the field with singles. Kyeong Kang and Dariel Alvarez each had a pair. Tim Berry seemed to have his stuff working. Young Mr. Berry struck out seven in six innings, but also walked four. He only allowed one earned run and didn't \xc2\xa0allow any homers. Jason Gurka allowed a run in relief, But Oliver Drake finished off the game and was credited with his 13th save.    Frederick Keys 6, Myrtle Beach Pelicans 1 Parker Bridwell, while at times frustrating, has also maybe been one of the best stories in the organization this season. It's always a small victory when Bridwell isn't his own undoing and he did well on that account as he walked one and allowed one three hits...though, one was a solo homer. Bridwell also struck out four and induced eight groundouts in six innings of work.      Parker Bridwell with his fifth straight quality start at home: 6IP, 3H, R, BB, 4 SO.\r \xe2\x80\x94 Frederick Keys (@FrederickKeys) June 15, 2014       The Keys senior auxiliary did the heavy lifting today as Michael Burgess, Sammie Starr, Jason Esposito and Brenden Webb homered. Burgess also doubled, singled and stole a base.    Delmarva Shorebirds 6, West Virginia Power 5 The Shorebirds offense was efficient and productive enough to complete a sweep of the West Virginia Power. Chance Sisco and Greg Lorenzo had two hit games; Trey Mancini and Connor Bierfeldt homered while Drew Dosch walked three times. Dosch also singled and stole a base. Despite going 1-10 in the last couple games, Mike Yastrzemski is STILL SLGing .702 in his last ten. That's what a pair of two homer games will do for you, I guess. Little Yaz also was credited with his 13th outfield assist on the season. Why do people keep challenging him? Luc Rennie demonstrated he is a bona fide O's pitcher by cruising through five innings of work and collapsing in the sixth. In that inning, the Power opened things up with three straight singles before hitting into a force. Rennie promptly served up a homer to the next batter JaCoby Jones. Big Jon Keller came on in relief and uncharacteristically struggled through the final 2/3 of the inning, but made quick work of the Power in his next couple innings to secure the win. Jimmy the Yak was credited with his 14th save of the season. Aberdeen Ironbirds 2, Hudson Valley Renegades 4 Dylan Bundy's return did not disappoint. \xc2\xa0In his first, official regular season start since 2012, Bundy allowed one earned run and struck out six in five innings. He did allow some hard contact in the form of a couple doubles and a triple, but...      Heard Bundy was mostly 91 to 93 mph on the velo at Hudson Valley.\r \xe2\x80\x94 Steve Melewski (@masnSteve) June 15, 2014       Oh, yeah...Bundy was also 8/0 groundout to air out. 2013 draftee Alex Murphy singled and walked.

Tonight was one of those nights, as he was brought in retire a left-handed pinch hitter in the eighth inning of a tie game. Once he came in, Rays manager Joe Maddon pinch hit for the pinch hitter, someone named Jerry Sands. Sands only had 11 plate appearances coming into the game, but he's a right-handed hitter. Because he is a right-handed hitter, he beat Matusz with a two-run home run to give the Rays a 5-3 lead. With only three outs to go, it was enough for the Rays, who won 5-4.    Of course, it wasn't only Matusz who is to blame for the loss. There is never one player as we all know. If the offense had been able to get to starting pitcher Jake Odorizzi for more than two runs, the Matusz meltdown may never have had happened. If David Lough hadn't bunted J.J. Hardy to second base in the seventh inning to put him in scoring position for Ryan Flaherty and Caleb Joseph, who knows how the inning would have turned out. If Nelson Cruz could have managed more than an infield single in the eighth inning, or Steve Pearce's line drive to left field had been a foot to the right, the Orioles might have walked away with a win. But what we'll remember is Matusz, who is so awful at pitching to righties that he couldn't even retire a fella named Jerry Sands. Sands, a 26 year old with 77 career games in the majors but only 16 since 2011, got the best of Matusz. In his career, right-handed hitters .304/.370/.490 against Matusz. This year, despite years of data working against him, Matusz has somehow faced more righties than lefties, and those righties are OPS'ing .875. He's now given up 16 hits to right-handed batters, and 9 of them have gone for extra bases. So how is this allowed to happen? In some instances, Matusz has given up hits to righties that get hits off of everyone. Hitters like Andrew McCutchen and Dustin Pedroia, for example. Why is he ever allowed to face those guys? But he's also given up hits to Robinson Chirinos and Dioner Navarro and, now, Jerry Sands. And if he can't get out hitters like that, why is he on the team? I'm being harsh on Matusz, and possibly unfair. But it's very frustrating to know that any team with a righty on the bench can throw him up against Matusz and completely take away any advantage the Orioles were trying to get by bringing him into the game in the first place.    The underwhelming offense and blow up by Matusz overshadow the fact that the starting pitcher Wei-Yin Chen added to the O's run of quality starts, which now stands at eight. It was a classic Chen start, really. He gave up three runs on two home runs and walked only one, with a pitch count jacked up due to approximately 500 foul balls against him. He got through 6 2/3 innings, though, and kept his team in the game long enough for them to come back. And they did come back, once! Down 3-0 in the top of the sixth inning, Nick Markakis doubled ahead of Adam Jones, who hit his 12th home run of the year. The game was tied in the eighth when the Orioles loaded the bases with one out, but could only score one run on an RBI infield single from Cruz. Neither Hardy nor the pinch-hitting Pearce could knock in any more, though, squashing the rally. Pearce nearly had a bases-clearing double, but it hit just a little bit foul in left field, and he ended up grounding out to end the inning. After Brian Matusz happened, pinch hitter Delmon Young homered in the top of the 9th with one out. That made the score 5-4, but Markakis and Manny Machado both popped out to end the game.    The loss gives the Orioles a record of 35-34, and they fell 1/2 game behind the idle Yankees to fall into third place. They are back in action tomorrow with Miguel Gonzalez returning form the disabled list to face former Oriole Erik Bedard.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
06/17/2014,"[('Orioles Lose Game of Inches, and Matt Wieters', 'Jun 16, 2014; St. Petersburg, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Steve Pearce (28) breaks his bat after he hit during the eighth inning at Tropicana Field. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsIt is always said that baseball is a game of inches, and various plays for the Orioles in their 5-4 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays illustrated this truth on Monday night.After falling behind 3-0, but then recovering to tie the game at 3-3, the Orioles had a chance in the top of the eighth inning to break into the lead. Nelson Cruz had just tied the game with a bases-loaded Baltimore chop single, and Steve Pearce came in to pinch hit for David Lough. His line drive into the left-field corner went foul by inches before hopping over the wall. That would have been two runs and I\xe2\x80\x99d be writing about something different today \xe2\x80\x93 probably how clutch Peace is.And of course, every at-bat involves inches. Brian Matusz, who has been so good at stranding inherited runners, came on in the bottom of the eighth inning; and facing that power threat Jerry Sands, Matusz allowed a fastball too far over the plate. It of course went too far over the wall, scoring O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s leadoff walk and providing the eventual margin of victory. Delmon Young continued to add to the his case for getting more playing time by homering in the ninth as a pinch hitter.It is sort of anti-climatic to finally get the news that Matt Wieters is out for the season and having Tommy John surgery on the day this article is posting (June 17).\xc2\xa0 It is interesting to read how the recovery for a non-pitcher is shorter, which makes sense I guess.\xc2\xa0Without Wieters in the lineup at all the O\xe2\x80\x99s are 19-24.So just how valuable is Wieters to the Orioles? This may not be the whole story, but the fact is that they were 12-10 in games with Wieters as catcher, and they were 4-0 with him at DH. Without him in the lineup at all the O\xe2\x80\x99s are 19-24. It is sad that this happened after Matt had his best start ever in any season of his career.I was very interested in seeing Caleb Joseph getting a chance at last to make the majors and play. But it was pretty clear that the Orioles organization did not really believe that he could handle the defensive side of things sufficiently. But as just one more evidence of 2014 being an entirely upside-down season, Joseph has played great defense but looks often over-powered at the plate.But Joseph is not the only O\xe2\x80\x99s player looking overpowered and over-matched. Honestly, Chris Davis does in many at-bats. Frequently the ball is past him when he is swinging. In the spirit of the late Tony Gwynn \xe2\x80\x93 the most amazing hitting machine you\xe2\x80\x99d just about ever see (for those of you not old enough to remember) \xe2\x80\x93 he used a light bat to have total control and place the ball wherever he desired. Perhaps the time has come for Davis to drop a few ounces in his bat selection in order to have greater control.And could someone please tell J.J. Hardy to get up on the plate a bit more? He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cover the outside well and is often beaten on the corners of the zone.And again, in more \xe2\x80\x9cother news,\xe2\x80\x9d Clay Rapada is back with the organization and will report to AAA Norfolk. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say. If nothing else, he at least adds to the average size of Orioles pitchers.Tonight the Orioles will see the return of Miguel Gonzalez after a short time on the DL. There have been eight consecutive quality starts by O\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers. Can he keep it going?The Orioles will be facing their old \xe2\x80\x9cfriend\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mr. Personality himself, Eric Bedard. He is 3-4 with a 3.55 ERA. His seasonal game log looks a bit like Chris Tillman, in that he either has it together for a game or he gets hit pretty hard. Three of the last four games have been of the latter variety; however, in the five games prior to that he only gave up three runs over 28 innings.It is too painful to even imagine Bedard shutting down the Orioles and dropping them to .500, though honestly, right now that is what the Orioles essentially are \xe2\x80\x93 a .500 team with the untapped potential to be much, much better.

He was 54.His death was announced by Major League Baseball.Gwynn had surgery for cancer of the mouth and salivary glands in recent years and had been on medical leave as the baseball coach at San Diego State University, his alma mater. He attributed the cancer to having dipped tobacco throughout his career.Playing all 20 of his major league seasons with the often lackluster San Diego Padres, in one of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s lesser media markets, and usually shunning home run swings in favor of well-struck hits, Gwynn was not one of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s more charismatic figures. And his pudgy 5-foot-11, 215-pound frame (give or take a few pounds) did not evoke streamlined athleticism.He simply possessed a brilliant consistency with his left-handed batting stroke, compiling a career batting average of .338. He was also a Gold Glove-winning outfielder and an outstanding base stealer before knee injuries took their toll.

For the Orioles, they may have one of the best in the game. His goofy personality, and on going competition with Tommy Hunter to see who can catch the most home run balls, has endeared him to fans.    Bio Name: Darren Christopher O\'Day\xc2\xa0Number: 56Born: October 22, 1982 (31 years old) in Jacksonville, FLHeight: 6\'4""\xc2\xa0Weight: 220 lbsBats: Right\xc2\xa0Throws: RightDrafted: Undrafted, signed with Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim as an amateur free agentSchool: Bishop Kenney High School (Jacksonville, FL)University of Florida (Gainesville, FL)Contract: $3,200,000 in 2014 ($4,250,000 team option for 2015, $400,000 buyout)Became an Oriole: Selected off waivers from the Texas Rangers on November 2, 2011Walk-up music: ""Thickfreakness"" by the Black KeysTwitter: @DODay56 Personal It\'s pretty surprising to discover that a man named O\'Day is not Irish. In fact, according to an article in\xc2\xa0the Baltimore Sun last year, he is actually Polish. About forty years ago Darren\'s father, Ralph, and one of his uncles legally changed their name from Odachowski to O\'Day. It was done as a tribute to their mother, Darren\'s grandmother. She was left as a widow with three sons after her husband died in a car accident when Ralph was 13 years old. To make ends meet and put all of her boys through college she worked long hours. At work, it made things easier for her to shorten her name to Odach; the ""ch"" was silent so it sounded like what we\xc2\xa0pronounce\xc2\xa0now as ""O\'Day"".    To this day, Darren still has ""D. Odachowski"" stiched into the glove he uses in games.    Fast forward about thirty years when young Darren was going from high school to college. He was a good baseball player and always had a passion for it. He was no star, though. He only played varsity baseball his junior and senior years; not a four-year phenom. But still, some smaller schools had shone interest. He decided to go with his lofty academic expectations and attended the University of Florida, hoping for the best with baseball. His freshman year he tried out for the Gators as a walk-on and was cut. It was a bummer for O\'Day but he was looking towards a future in medicine. He was an animal science major and would later decide that he wanted to pursue a career as a plastic surgeon.    However, before giving up baseball forever he played in an adult baseball league with some friends. There, he showed off his new side-arm pitching motion. He mixed it in with his regular over-the-top delivery and had some success. The new motion plus extra time in the gym led to some increased velocity and he gave the Gators baseball team another go. This time, he struck out all of the walk-on hitters he faced and made the team, going on to pitch for four years and even earning a scholarship. While at Florida, O\'Day met his future wife, and fellow UF alum, Elizabeth Prann. She was a journalism student and a member of the women\'s club lacrosse team. Now, many may be familiar with her as a reporter for FOX News, making her the more famous one in the couple. The two were married on November 20, 2010 in Atlanta, GA.    After college, O\'Day toyed with the idea of leaving baseball behind once again and pursuing medical school. His grades were good enough to get in just about anywhere and Major League organizations weren\'t exactly knocking his door down. He went undrafted as a fifth year senior and his biggest suitor was former big leaguer Casey Kotchman\'s dad, Tom. He was a scout for the Angels. It would take some convincing. O\'Day spoke with Dr. John Poser, a former All-Big Ten pitcher for Wisconsin. Poser had been in O\'Day\'s position. He let his father convince him to stick with medicine. In turn, Poser told O\'Day to give baseball one more chance. So with that, and a $20,000 signing bonus, O\'Day became a member of the Angels organization. From there, his climb to the majors began and it was fast. It took three seasons before he made his debut with the Angels in 2008. That year, he made 30 appearances and pitched to a 4.57 ERA before tearing his shoulder in September and being removed from Anaheim\'s 40-man roster. That December he was selected in the Rule Five draft by the New York Mets. Hours before O\'Day made his debut for the Mets, he received word that a good friend of his in the Angels organization, Nick Adenhart, had been killed in a car accident involving a drunk driver. Several days after that, the Mets took him off of their 40-man roster and he was claimed by the Texas Rangers. He met the team in Toronto and, upon arriving at the Rogers Centre, he learned that they didn\'t have a jersey for him so he had to\xc2\xa0wear Kason Gabbard\'s jersey. The jersey wasn\'t lucky and O\'Day gave up a walk off single to Kevin Millar.    The Rangers then headed to Baltimore. After landing, Darren rented a car and drove to Adenhart\'s grave in Williamsport, PA. As a sign of respect, O\'Day writes Adenhart\'s initials on each of his hats worn in the game. After a few years of great perfomance, he caught the injury bug and couldn\'t stay off the DL. The Rangers placed him on waivers, the Orioles picked him up and the rest, as they say, is history.

For example, he pre-ordered the original iPad when he was with the Rangers. To mess with him, fellow reliver Darren Oliver stole the package before O\'Day received it and hid it from him. - In high school, O\'Day and his friends thought it would be funny if one of them hid in the trunk of their car. Then, they would drive down the road, stop, and have that friend jump out of the car to make it seem like a kidnapping. Unfortunately for them, a lady saw this plan in action and called the police with O\'Day\'s license plate number. The cops went to O\'Day\'s home, but nothing serious needed to be done. - At the University of Florida, O\'Day was convinced by his then-girlfriend, Prann, and the women\'s club lacrosse team to don a lacrosse uniform, including the skirt all of the girls have to wear.

After an initial ruling that the ball had hit off the wall, a replay confirmed that it had struck the bottom of the foul pole, giving Davis his third career slam and the Orioles a 5-0 lead. The review took 1 minute, 18 seconds.It was Davis\' 12th homer of the season.""I was going to catch it right at the pole, so I\'d do the same thing again, but I don\'t want to do that again,"" DeJesus said. ""I hope he doesn\'t hit it there anymore.""""I was glad to see him get up,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""He hit that wall pretty hard ... the baseball gods were kind to us tonight.""After the Rays cut the lead to 5-4, the Orioles got a two-run homer from Steve Pearce in the seventh.""That was the one that was tough to come back from,"" Rays manager Joe Maddon said. ""That made it difficult.""Sean Rodriguez and Desmond Jennings homered for Tampa Bay, which is 5-16 in its last 21 games. Rodriguez and Jennings hit consecutive solo homers off Miguel Gonzalez (4-4).Tampa Bay made it 5-4 on James Loney\'s two-run double during the fifth.Gonzalez, activated from the 15-day disabled list before the game, allowed four runs and eight hits in five innings. He had been out since May 31 due to a strained right oblique.  Zach Britton pitched the ninth for his eighth save.Bedard (3-5) gave up five runs and four hits over four-plus innings, his fifth start of four innings or less.""It really comes down to starting pitching drives the engine, and Frenchy (Bedard) had a tough day,"" Maddon said.

This is exactly the sort of game you might think they will lose if only because they keep showing us they are a .500 team. But, they should still be better than the last place Rays, even so. Right? It's just that they get mysteriously shut down by pitchers who are awful this year like Jake Odorizzi. It's not mysterious. This happens because their approach collectively sucks.    Pitchers LHP Erik Bedard, Rays2014: 12 G, 56.1 IP, 3.83 ERA, 46 SO, 24 BB, .252 BAA, 1.46 WHIPLast start (vs. Cardinals): 4 IP, 8 H, 3 ER, 1 BB, 4 SO Well, here's a familiar name. Once what passed for an ace on some awful Orioles teams, Bedard has bounced around since being shipped to Seattle in that highway robbery. Velocity that peaked as high as an average of 92.6mph on his fastball is now down to 88.7 this year. He throws a cutter now. Whenever I hear about pitchers picking up a cutter, I think about Chris Tillman (part of that Bedard trade) trying to add a cutter to sacrifice velocity for movement and control. He got no movement and had no control. It all seems to work out better for Bedard, who is getting non-terrible results on a thus far terrible baseball team. He gets fewer ground balls than ever and yet is giving up fewer home runs than ever. Inducing weak contact, or one hell of a lot of luck? Maybe the difference is pitching at the Trop. Batters have a .219/.305/.289 against Bedard in 29 innings at the Trop this year. That is sub-Flahertian.    RHP Miguel Gonzalez, Orioles2014: 11 G, 58.1 IP, 4.17 ERA, 50 SO, 21 BB, .261 BAA, 1.37 WHIPLast start (at Astros): 6.2 IP, 5 H, 2 ER, 2 BB, 4 SO This is Gonzalez's first start after a trip to the disabled list for an oblique injury. I hate oblique injuries for Orioles players because it feels like they ruin everything. Maybe that's not true. Significantly for Orioles starters, they are working on a streak of eight straight quality starts in a row, which is the longest since they had nine straight between the end of the 2010 season and the start of the 2011 season. The Orioles are 4-4 in those eight games. That is stupid. It also shows that quality starts don't mean all that much as far as the team winning games if other areas of the team are full of failure, like batters and Brian Matusz. Still, it's better to get a quality start from your starter than not.    Gonzalez faced the Rays earlier this season, giving up no runs over five innings.

The team was 6-12 in its first few weeks without him, and overall, 17-20 without him as of the end of the Tampa Bay series. But in the Major Leagues, they don\xe2\x80\x99t cry about these things, they just decide on solutions and move forward.A combination of\xc2\xa0Nick Hundley\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Caleb Joseph\xc2\xa0keeps doing the best it can, with Joseph proving the better of the two defensively thus far and that fact earning him more playing time. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 recent stretch of 11\xc2\xa0quality starts in the last 13 games, and their 3.54 team ERA over the last two weeks, are testimony to Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s defense and game-calling skills, even though the club is still just 13-13 in its last 26 games.

The last two wins over Tampa Bay were an example of the former. Tuesday night, Miguel Gonzales almost gave back a 5-2 lead, but\xc2\xa0Steve Pearce\xc2\xa0came through with a late homer to pad the lead and provide the final margin. Today brought a gem of a combined pitching performance, from\xc2\xa0Kevin Gausman, to a hopefully revitalized\xc2\xa0Tommy Hunter, to a rock-solid\xc2\xa0Zach Britton.Gausman has a .95 ERA since joining the team June 7This was Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s (3-1) third fine outing in a row, and his escape from a bases loaded pickle in the first inning showed another step in his growth: How to recover\xc2\xa0when his pitches are getting squeezed. He has a .95 ERA since June 7, allowing two earned runs in 19 innings over that span.

The league allegedly suspended him four games for the Sunday game vs. Oakland (when he threw the bat), and one game for the altercation in the Friday night game (with Josh Donaldson).

""You would hope a figure like (Gwynn), something tragic like that happening, would be a wake-up call for everyone, not just those in baseball. \xe2\x80\xa6 But most guys are probably going to look at it as the loss of a great man and a great baseball player and leave it at that.\'\'Indeed, the stance among players seems to be that they\'re aware of the dangers but, like smoking, it\'s up to every individual to decide whether to use what remains a legal product.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Tony Gwynn was the purest hitter of an impure eraThe National Cancer Institute says in its website that smokeless tobacco contains at least 28 chemicals that have been found to cause cancer \xe2\x80\x93 typically of the mouth, esophagus and pancreas \xe2\x80\x93 and may also lead to heart disease, gum disease and oral lesions.""People understand the risks involved and still choose to do it,\'\' Texas Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said. ""We all do stupid things, whatever your vice happens to be. People may criticize these guys for dipping, and then somebody\'s texting and driving.\'\'And while Gwynn\'s passing was lamented throughout the game, it doesn\'t figure to be interpreted by many players \xe2\x80\x93 who are usually in their 20s or early 30s, with the concomitant sense of invincibility \xe2\x80\x93 as a cautionary tale.""It\'s one of those things that\'s scary and obviously you hope you\'re not the one,\'\' said A\'s catcher Stephen Vogt, who said he dips once in a while. ""I don\'t think it\'s good. I definitely don\'t advocate it, but at the same time, it\'s an adult decision.\'\'Baseball has taken steps to sway that decision, or at least make the practice less visible to minimize the impact on young fans.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } The San Diego Padres pay tribute to late legend Tony GwynnThe current collective bargaining agreement, in effect from 2012-16, bans players, managers and coaches from using smokeless tobacco during TV interviews and team appearances. And they have to keep tobacco products out of sight while fans are at the ballpark.In addition, MLB and the players union have stepped up educational efforts, and teams \xe2\x80\x93 which in the past freely distributed cans of dip in the clubhouse \xe2\x80\x93 can no longer do so and are now required to administer oral exams as part of the spring training physicals every year.Longtime TV announcer Joe Garagiola, who quit his smokeless tobacco habit in his 30s, made it his life\'s mission to warn other baseball folks about its dangers, making presentations during spring training alongside former major league outfielder Billy Tuttle, who died of oral cancer at 69 in 1998.""I don\'t think we talk about it enough anymore,"" says Atlanta Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez. ""I remember as a young A-ball manager, Joe Garagiola would always come around in spring training with Bill Tuttle.  It was scary.""And I still see people chewing tobacco. Not only in the big leagues, but you still see kids in junior high and high school.For me, it\'s not enough yet. It\'s a shame.""     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Nightengale: Tony Gwynn left a lasting impressionIndeed, the sight of players constantly spitting, some sporting a large wad of tobacco inside their cheek, remains one of the game\'s enduring images.""Every spring training we have a guy that comes in who\'s had mouth cancer through tobacco,\'\' Rangers utilityman Donnie Murphy said. ""So you see it. But at the same time, it\'s like an addiction thing. You do it for so long, you\'re going to want to keep doing it.\'\'Players say using smokeless tobacco provides a form of relaxation and becomes part of their routine in a daily sport with lots of down time.And with amphetamines now banned from baseball, the jolt of energy from the nicotine in the tobacco \xe2\x80\x93 absorbed during a longer stretch through dip or chew than by smoking \xe2\x80\x93 can help players navigate the season\'s six-month grind.Commissioner Bud Selig has expressed a desire to banish smokeless tobacco from the majors the same way MLB barred it from the minors starting in 1993. But the issue is subject to collective bargaining and the players association has declined, opting to protect personal freedoms and emphasize education.""The MLBPA discourages the use of smokeless tobacco products by its members or by anyone else. These products carry serious health risks, yet remain legally and widely available,\'\' union spokesman Greg Bouris said via e-mail. ""In general terms, included in the smokeless tobacco policy negotiated in 2011 are restrictions/prohibitions on its use, increased emphasis on education and cessation programs, as well as oral examinations.

Wes Murray comes to us as a veteran of the now defunct Seattle Sports Nut, as well as having a stint writing for Bleacher Report. He\xe2\x80\x99s played and been around sports for most of his life, including swimming and baseball. He\xe2\x80\x99s followed the Orioles for the past few years given the fact that they were a struggling team for some time, however certainly of late they\xe2\x80\x99ve turned things around.Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsWes will be focusing primarily on the minor league side of the organization, however don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if he sprinkles in an article about the big league club from time to time. You may have noticed that we\xe2\x80\x99ve recently had much more coverage of the minor league system under the guidance of co-editor Mike Franz, and we\xe2\x80\x99re very thankful for those efforts and are glad that Wes will be a part of that. On behalf of our staff at Birds Watcher and the Fansided Network, join me in welcoming Wes Murray to our team!The Baltimore Orioles will open up a big series this weekend in New York, with Ubaldo Jimenez taking to the mound tonight. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Hiroki Kuroda of New York, with game time at 7 PM at Yankee Stadium.

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles open an important three-game series with the Yankees in New York. But really, how important can a series be in late June? It is not possible to fully understand or answer that question until the season is over, but at this juncture, the Orioles could greatly benefit from a series win.Though the Yankees are largely held in derision by most O\xe2\x80\x99s fans, the Evil Empire has provided the AL East with the good service of pulling back the Toronto Blue Jays to the rest of the pack. Perhaps the Jays\xe2\x80\x99 fun in the sun is about to end and they are beginning the walk down the steps to their bedroom in the basement. Perhaps the Jays are walking down the steps to their bedroom in the basement.After three straight losses to the Yankees, Toronto is now 1.5 games ahead of New York and 2.5 in front of the Baltimore Orioles.Since the Birds will be facing Masahiro Tanaka on Sunday, it would probably be a good idea for them to get the series off to a good start with a Friday night win at The Stadium. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryNone of the stats going into this game favor the Orioles, so by 2014 standards that is a very good sign.When Ubaldo Jimenez pitches, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are not often going to be the favored team on paper. Even so, a reasonable argument could be made that his performances, though not stellar by any measure, are not quite as bad as his numbers. But, at this point he is on pace to finish the season with a record of 5-18. A lot of pitchers could have done that cheaper than at $12.5 million.Killing Jimenez is his 1.51 WHIP \xe2\x80\x93 much as a result of a whopping 45 walks in 76 innings. As we have written all year, his pitch movement and \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d is generally among the best. The problem is that the ball tends to also move out of the strike zone. Patient Yankee hitters will tend to give it plenty of time to do just that by not helping him with easy outs early in counts.It was no secret when Jimenez was acquired that he did not have great career numbers against the Yankees or AL East. For his career he is 1-4, 6.67 against the Yanks, and 1-2, 5.09 at Yankee Stadium.Jimenez lost to the Yankees in his second start of the season, going 4.2 innings in NY, giving up four runs on eight hits and five walks. It actually could have been worse.Hopefully the pitcher who threw three consecutive great games at the beginning of May will be the one who shows up tonight after a full week of rest. Frankly, I\xe2\x80\x99m good with this current six-man rotation the Orioles have fallen into. More quality starts going deep into games could extend it a bit longer.The Yankees turn to their 38-year-old veteran Hiroki Kuroda, who now has a career record of 72-75 \xe2\x80\x93 surprisingly poorer than you would expect for a 3.46 ERA and being with the Dodgers and Yankees. In seven career starts, he is 3-3 with a 3.15 ERA against the Baltimore Orioles, including a win earlier this season.Against Kuroda, Nick Markakis is 8-for-22 with two doubles and a homer, Chris Davis is 6-for-23 with two doubles and two home runs, and Adam Jones is 7-for-25 with a double.However, J.J. Hardy is 3-for-24 with a double and homer, Nelson Cruz is 3-for-17, and Delmon Young is 1-for-6.Will Buck Showalter stick with the hot bat of Steve Pearce (who is 0-for-4 against Kuroda)? And if he does keep him in the lineup, does Manny Machado return to the second spot, since he is 5-for-18 with a double and two homers against Hiroki?And who do you play at second base? Ryan Flaherty has a homer in 10 at-bats while Jonathon Schoop has a double in two plate appearances. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

The Orioles won 6-1. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson)NEW YORK (AP) -- Nelson Cruz has been hitting homers all season. J.J. Hardy finally got in on the fun Saturday, against a likely opponent.Cruz hit his 23rd home run, Hardy connected for his first of the year and the Baltimore Orioles beat the New York Yankees 6-1 after starter Bud Norris left with tightness in his right groin.Adam Jones and Steve Pearce also went deep off struggling soft-tosser Vidal Nuno, helping the Orioles rebound after blowing a two-run lead in the ninth inning of a 5-3 loss Friday night.''Big win for us,'' Hardy said.Cruz and Pearce each had a two-run shot. Hardy ended a drought of 339 at-bats that dated to last September.''It definitely felt nice,'' he said. ''I felt like I forgot how to do it.''''I think it probably is a little bit of a relief. I started to question myself if I ever was going to hit one again,'' Hardy added.Mark Teixeira hit his 12th home run for the Yankees, who had won four straight and eight of 10, but that was all they managed against Norris and three relievers.During a pregame ceremony on the field, former New York first baseman Tino Martinez was honored with a plaque to be placed in Monument Park.Making his first start against the Yankees, Norris (7-5) allowed three hits in five innings and matched a career high by winning his fourth straight start. He warmed up on the mound for the sixth but was pulled for Ryan Webb, who pitched two scoreless innings.Tommy Hunter got the final five outs.Norris said he felt something ''kind of funny'' while throwing a fastball in the fifth.''It kind of grabbed on me,'' he said. ''I've had groin stuff before, especially my left one but not necessarily my right one. You've got to be real careful with those.''''I could see it getting a little worse and I wanted to be smart, but really, hats off to the offense for scoring and to the bullpen for picking me up,'' Norris added. ''Pretty sore right now.''Orioles manager Buck Showalter said Norris probably will pitch the night game of a split doubleheader Friday against Tampa Bay, but the right-hander said it was too soon to tell.''We've got other options, but I'm hoping we caught it in time,'' Showalter said.Pressed into the rotation because of injuries to CC Sabathia, Ivan Nova and Michael Pineda, Nuno (1-4) is having a hard time with the homer-friendly dimensions at Yankee Stadium. He was rocked in his previous outing in Oakland and is 0-4 since beating the Los Angeles Angels on May 7.''This is what we have. And as I said, it's not like there's just starting pitchers lying around out there,'' New York manager Joe Girardi said, explaining that Nuno will stay in the rotation. ''Right now, this is what it is.''The left-hander yielded five runs - four earned - and six hits in 6 1-3 innings. He allowed three home runs and has served up 13 in 39 1-3 innings this season at home, where he is 0-3 with a 7.09 ERA.''My fastball today, I just left it up too much,'' Nuno said. ''I trusted all my stuff today. No regrets and everything, but they just got to my fastball.''Jones hit a solo shot with two outs in the first and drew a leadoff walk in the fourth before Cruz connected. Cruz began the day one home run behind Toronto slugger Edwin Encarnacion for the major league lead.''He's carried us along a lot of the season,'' Hardy said.Pearce's drive made it 5-1 in the fifth, and Hardy went deep off Jose Ramirez in the eighth for his 159th career homer and first since Sept. 5, 2013, against Jose Quintana of the Chicago White Sox.''We like hitting home runs,'' Jones said.Back in the dugout, Hardy got the silent treatment. He threw sunflower seeds on himself and was doused with water by Cruz.The two-time All-Star shortstop has hit at least 22 home runs five times, including a career-high 30 with Baltimore in 2011.''Normally I just put my head down and run. This time I kind of watched a little bit to make sure that it got up,'' Hardy said. ''As I was rounding third, I looked into the dugout and no one had moved. So I kind of knew that they were going to sit there.''NOTES: Baltimore recalled reliever Brad Brach from Triple-A Norfolk. ... Nuno has allowed 15 homers in 67 1-3 innings overall. ... Pineda (right shoulder muscle) will get another week off after an MRI still showed ''a trace of inflammation,'' Girardi said. ...

And even that was a quality start, giving up three earned runs is six innings (or maybe it is not officially, as there was also an additional unearned run). Every one of his starts has been a quality start. Does that make him an ace? In fact, he has never given up more than three earned runs.One of Tanaka\xe2\x80\x99s two non-decisions (and the one that was a loss) was his early season game against the Orioles. He went seven innings and gave up that huge three-run home run to Jonathan Schoop. So, in the words of Dumb and Dumber, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m saying there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance.\xe2\x80\x9dAnd here is another reason to have at least a one-in-a-million hope, especially for a team that hit four home runs on Saturday: Tanaka will reach 100 innings pitched on his next out; he has given up 25 runs, and 13 of those have been on homers \xe2\x80\xa6 though eight of them were solo shots. The guy is good.Tying this together with another recent blog post about Ubaldo Jimenez \xe2\x80\xa6 if you take away the games started by these two pitchers for their respective teams, the Orioles are 35-23 while the Yankees are 27-32. That is an 8.5-game difference for those of you who can\xe2\x80\x99t figure it out because of Common Core math.The Baltimore Orioles will send their erstwhile ace Chris Tillman to the mound. Sometimes he can be an ace, and sometimes he\xe2\x80\x99s an \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 less than an ace. He has only given up four runs in his last 13 innings, but both games were losses. Tillman is 5-4 with a 4.82 ERA and WHIP of 1.49.Let\xe2\x80\x99s call this to be a 4-3 Orioles win that we will look back upon as a turning point moment of the season.

Sixty percent of their original starters have been on the disabled list since early May, yet the Yankees have essentially a league-average rotation ERA in late June.Masahiro Tanaka has been arguably the best starter in the American League. Rookie Chase Whitley has been a revelation. David Phelps and Hiroki Kuroda have been perfectly solid and occasionally terrific.But the fifth spot has been a problem, and the fact Vidal Nuno remains on turn to make his next start shows the Yankees really have run out of alternatives. Nuno allowed three home runs and lost his fourth straight decision in a 6-1 loss to the Orioles at Yankee Stadium on Saturday.BOX SCORE: Orioles 8, Yankees 0Granted, the Yankees offense didn\'t do much to support him \xe2\x80\x94 Mark Teixeira\'s solo homer was their only run \xe2\x80\x94 but Nuno\'s rough day was nothing new.Even so, he\'s going to start again.""This is what we have,"" manager Joe Girardi said. ""It\'s not like there\'s just starting pitchers lying around out there. We\'ve talked about that, and our guys have done a pretty good job. They really have. He\'ll continue to go out there and compete and we\'ll do the best we can.""GOOSE GOSSAGE: Hall of Famer gets Monument Park honorORIOLES TRADE: No players, just a Rolex for jersey numberThe Yankees have lost two of Nuno\'s past eight starts, but his 5.88 ERA is easily the worst in the team\'s patchwork rotation. Of his 15 home runs allowed this season, 13 have come at home.""Sometimes I leave (a fastball) up a little bit and they take advantage of it,"" Nuno said. ""Yeah, it\'s frustrating just knowing that I\'m not getting the job done, but overall how I see my stuff today is improvement of my other starts.""Nuno allowed five runs, four earned, through 6 1/3 innings.""A lot of nights that\'ll give you a chance to win the game,"" Girardi said. ""We just didn\'t score a lot of runs today, and it probably looks worse than it is.""It\'s also not an isolated incident. Nuno\'s lost his past two starts, and in between the Yankees had a four-game losing streak. Alternatives, though, are few and far between.The Class AAA bullpen is depleted by call-ups and underwhelming performances, particularly from prospect Shane Greene who had a breakout season in Class AA last year. Another top prospect, Manny Banuelos, has been underwhelming in Class AA.The best rotation alternative might be Adam Warren, but he\'s become a trusted setup reliever, and despite having worked as a starter all through the minors and occasionally in the major leagues, Warren is not stretched out enough to throw more than three innings at a time. He could be converted back to a starter, but it would take time and cost a valued reliever.So, for now it\'s Nuno, who gave up a solo home run to Adam Jones in the first inning, a two-run home run to Nelson Cruz in the fourth, and a two-run homer to Steve Pearce in the fifth.""Right now this is our rotation and this is what it will be,"" Girardi said. ""We\'ll just continue to plow forward, and hopefully (CC Sabathia and Michael Pineda\'s) rehabs get going and you get some guys off the DL that are coming back.""But right now, this is what it is.""Chad Jennings writes for The Journal News.BASEBALL NAMES HONORED AT YANKEES\' MONUMENT PARK:FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInLegends honored at Yankees\' Monument Park\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

He hardly strengthened his position in the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 6-1 loss, allowing five runs, four of them earned, in six and a third innings while giving up three home runs.While Manager Joe Girardi did not officially put Nuno on alert after he gave up eight runs in three innings last week against the Oakland Athletics, there had been hints that his time in the rotation could be limited.General Manager Brian Cashman said during the week that the team could stretch out reliever Adam Warren in the event that there was an opening in the rotation \xe2\x80\x94 presumably Nuno\xe2\x80\x99s spot. But Girardi seemed to play down that possibility Thursday, suggesting that Warren had become too valuable in the bullpen to become a starter. Cashman also said the team had no alternatives in the minors, although he vowed that he would make every effort to make a trade to help the club.

After Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game, Girardi said his rotation would not change for the moment. It appears that Nuno will have at least another opportunity to save his job, although the Yankees have two days off in the next couple of weeks that would allow them to skip Nuno\xe2\x80\x99s turn. The Yankees do not necessarily need a fifth starter until early July.

But Nuno found some solace in that he had a better feel for his cutter than he had had in several starts. His biggest problem has been locating his fastball. His numbers at Yankee Stadium (31 earned runs in 391/3 innings, with 13 home runs) are especially troubling.\xe2\x80\x9cAt times, I\xe2\x80\x99m trusting all my stuff, and I\xe2\x80\x99m positive,\xe2\x80\x9d Nuno said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut sometimes, hitters are sitting on fastballs, and they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for one pitch, and they got it.\xe2\x80\x9d Photo       Nelson Cruz hit a two-run homer in the fourth.

He is scheduled to fly to Tampa, Fla., in the next few days and will throw a live batting practice session on Tuesday. If all goes well, he could throw in a minor league rehabilitation game Saturday. To help his recovery, Sabathia is using a knee brace that he will very likely try to use when he pitches in games. Photo       Steve Pearce hit a two-run blast in the fifth inning.

06/23/2014,"[('Preview: White Sox Vs. Orioles \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Two of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s top home run hitters meet for the first time as Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s Baltimore Orioles take on Jose Abreu\xe2\x80\x99s Chicago White Sox. One difference between these right-handed sluggers is how they fare against left-handers, and that will be on display Monday night. Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Sale and Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Wei-Yin Chen will be on the mound to start a three-game series, as the White Sox look to avoid a fifth straight loss overall and eighth in a row on the road. Cruz is second in the majors with 23 homers while Abreu is third with 21. While Cruz is hitting .419 against left-handers for one of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s best marks, Abreu is much worse at .237. Abreu has never faced Baltimore (39-35) or Chen (7-2, 3.78 ERA). Cruz has a positive history versus Sale in going 3 for 8 with a homer. Sale (6-1, 2.20) is limiting hitters to a .171 average and enters after giving up three runs over six innings Wednesday to earn a 7-6 victory over San Francisco. His lone start against Baltimore came on the road Aug. 28, 2012. Sale yielded four runs over four innings in a 6-0 loss. The Orioles may want to bench Jonathan Schoop since he\xe2\x80\x99s a .197 hitter against left-handers. He has never faced Sale but came through in a big way Sunday with a homer off Yankees star Masahiro Tanaka in an 8-0 rout. J.J. Hardy capped a strong trip by going 2 for 4 with a three-run double. Hardy was 9 for 23 over six games, ending an 87-game drought without a homer in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 6-1 victory. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like a lot of balls have been getting through the infield, I have been pretty fortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d Hardy said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am trying to find that power stroke and hitting that homer yesterday was big for me.\xe2\x80\x9d Baltimore starters went 4-0 with a 2.29 ERA on the 4-2 trip and have posted a major league-best 1.87 ERA since June 9. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no rest for the weary because the big separator up here is the pitching you see,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see Sale tomorrow for the White Sox and if you dwell on it too long, there\xe2\x80\x99s another guy who\xe2\x80\x99s going to slap you back into reality.\xe2\x80\x9d The Orioles took four of seven from Chicago (35-41) last year and have won six of the last eight home meetings. Chen benefits from a 6.59 run-support average that is among the best marks in the majors. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost since May 3, going 4-0 with a 3.47 ERA in his last eight outings after giving up three runs over 6 2-3 innings last Monday in a 5-4 loss at Tampa Bay. The Orioles have won all three of Chen\xe2\x80\x99s starts against the White Sox, with the southpaw going 1-0 with a 2.60 ERA. He has held Adam Dunn hitless in six at-bats with three strikeouts. Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s woes continued with Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 6-5 loss at Minnesota. Abreu and Gordon Beckham each had two RBIs. \xe2\x80\x9cAnytime you sit there and pity yourself, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get buried,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Robin Ventura said. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody cares. You have to be able to pick yourself up off the mat and compete and then it works out.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0 Related Stories \xe2\x80\x93 Baltimore Orioles: Hosmer Hits Go-Ahead Double In 8th, Royals Beat Orioles\xc2\xa03-2Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones Donates $20K To Negro Leagues\xc2\xa0MuseumOrioles Prepare For First Of Three Games Against\xc2\xa0RoyalsThe Norris & Long Show Best Of \xe2\x80\x93 Week Of May\xc2\xa012thOrioles-Nationals Postponed By Rain; Makeup Game On June\xc2\xa08 \xc2\xa0  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), (""Baltimore Orioles' Pitching Blanks New York Yankees"", 'Jun 22, 2014; Bronx, NY, USA; Baltimore Orioles relief pitcher T.J.

Mandatory Credit: Anthony Gruppuso-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles take the series from the New York Yankees with an impressive 8-0 victory.The Orioles are now tied for second place and sit only a game and a half behind the Toronto Blue Jays, who have not been playing as well as in previous weeks.Chris Tillman pitched an excellent game, while the offense came through to put the game away.One thing to note is that Caleb Joseph was behind the plate again for an excellent pitching performance.Fans questioned the decision to send Steven Clevenger down, while retaining Caleb Joseph. I was among the fans who did not understand the decision. Clevenger had the better batting average, and just appeared to be the overall better offensive player.

Now that he has started more than twenty games, the reasons are clear why he is the obvious replacement for Matt Wieters.The numbers are seen with the starters over the past two weeks. Joseph started most of these games, and the starters have put up an ERA of 2.45.Between the games Wieters, Clevenger, Joseph, and Nick Hundley have played, the pitchers have the lowest ERA when Joseph is behind the plate at 2.72.Joseph has directed Orioles pitchers to more than entire point lower ERA than Wieters, now that Caleb has surpassed 200 innings behind the plate this season. Wieters started 22 games before being placed on the disabled list, while Joseph now has 24.With numbers this low, the pitchers are beginning to warm up to Joseph, which I believe contributes as a big reason for the recent success by the pitching staff.With the low ERA, the opponents\xe2\x80\x99 batting average is below .250 also. Joseph has caught nine runners attempting to steal, which is six more than the next closest catcher who has played this season.I had\xc2\xa0noted several\xc2\xa0mentions by other Orioles writers that the reason for some of the poor pitching had been the absence of Wieters.Joseph most certainly will not give the Orioles the same type of offense as Wieters, but I believe he can manage the pitchers for the remainder of the season. \xe2\x80\x9dI believe he can manage the pitchers for the remainder of the season.\xe2\x80\x9d24 games is only a small portion of the season, but I believe Showalter needs to put Joseph in front of Hundley for the starting job.Hundley has not had as many opportunities, but with barely 100 innings behind the plate, pitchers have an ERA of 4.94. One more comparison is that Joseph has more than double the number of innings, and only seven more earned runs allowed by the pitchers.Overall\xc2\xa0in hindsight, I feel Hundley was a mistake to pick up, and Clevenger deserves to be in the majors with his offensive capabilities.I would pay close to attention to Hundley\xe2\x80\x99s starts to see how the pitchers perform. If they do not pitch well, which the stats say they do not, Joseph needs to begin to play five (if not six) out of seven games .

Absalon, USA TODAY Sports)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Hours after reaching the low point of a disappointing and frustrating season, Chris Davis conjured memories of last year with one mighty swing of the bat.Davis interrupted a rare stint on the bench with a pinch-hit, three-run homer in the ninth inning to give the Baltimore Orioles a 6-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Monday night.Davis was excluded from the starting lineup after batting just .130 in his previous 14 starts. Called upon by manager Buck Showalter with runners on first and second and one out in the ninth, Davis launched a 3-2 pitch from Ronald Belisario (3-4) into the seats in right field.BOX SCORE: Orioles 6, White Sox 4""Any time you\'re able to deliver and come through for your team, it\'s big,"" Davis said. ""Like I said earlier today, I\'m working as hard as I can to get back on track.""Davis, who led the majors in home runs and RBIs last year, started the game in the dugout with a .216 batting average and 78 strikeouts in 218 at-bats. When it came time to deliver, though, he was ready.""There\'s no woe is me,"" Showalter said. ""He knows at some point the club\'s going to need a good at-bat from him and he prepared himself for it from about the fifth inning on.""POWER RANKINGS: O\'s on the riseDavis ended his night with a celebration at the plate, followed by a pie to the face from teammate Adam Jones during the post-game TV interview.""It was chocolate,"" Davis said. ""He told me he was going to pie me before he even came out there, and (I said), \'Make sure it\'s something tasty.\' I appreciate him letting me taste it before he smashed it in my face.""Your browser does not support iframes.Jones and Caleb Joseph also homered for the Orioles, who trailed 4-2 in the eighth before rallying to hand the White Sox their fifth straight defeat.Brad Brach (1-0) pitched two hitless innings for Baltimore.Jose Abreu hit his 22nd homer and drove in three runs for Chicago, which went 1 for 11 with runners in scoring position. Still, the White Sox were poised to win before Davis connected.""You got to be able to close it out,"" manager Robin Ventura said. ""It\'s not easy, especially when they got a guy like Chris on their bench.""White Sox starter Chris Sale gave up a career-high 11 hits in six innings but was in position to earn his seventh win after leaving with a 3-2 lead. The left-hander walked one, hit a batter and had a season-low three strikeouts.""My own manager was calling me Houdini,"" Sale said.Chicago trailed 2-1 until Abreu led off the sixth with a drive over the wall in center. Dayan Viciedo followed with a double and Conor Gillaspie chased starter Wei-Yin Chen with a run-scoring double.An RBI double by Abreu made it 4-2 in the seventh. The rookie ranks third in the AL in home runs and is tied for third with 60 RBIs.Joseph hit his second homer in two games, a solo shot off Zach Putnam in the eighth. The drive capped the rookie\'s first career three-hit game.That set the stage for Davis\' 13th home run. He hit 53 last year.Baltimore went up 2-0 in the first inning when Steve Pearce walked and Jones followed with a drive to center that bounced off the top of the wall, only the fifth home run allowed by Sale this season.Chicago got a run back in the third. Adam Eaton reached on an infield hit, Gordon Beckham doubled and Abreu hit a run-scoring groundout.In the bottom half, Sale struck out Delmon Young and J.J. Hardy after the Orioles put runners on the corners with one out. One inning later, Baltimore loaded the bases with one out before Pearce hit a short fly and Jones struck out.The trend continued in the fifth, when three straight singles filled the bases with no outs. After Manny Machado hit into a force at the plate, Jonathan Schoop bounced into a 4-6-3 double play.NOTES: Jones\' HR was his 151st with Baltimore, tying Chris Hoiles for 10th place on the Orioles\' career list. Of his 14 HRs this season, 10 have been solo shots. \xe2\x80\xa6 Eaton has reached base in 18 straight games, the longest streak by a White Sox left-handed batter since Juan Pierre had an 18-game run in 2011. \xe2\x80\xa6 Miguel Gonzalez makes his second career start against the White Sox on Tuesday night.

06/24/2014,"[('Get to know your Orioles: Caleb Joseph - Camden Chat', ' Before the season began, it seemed like Caleb Joseph was destined for another year at double-A Bowie. Another year of giving the ""real prospects"" some live action practice. His name had been thrown around as a possible back-up in Baltimore but he would be a distant runner-up.    As fate may have it, one mention of discomfort in Matt Wieters\' elbow and an underwhelming Steve Clevenger led to the unlikeliest of call-ups, making Joseph a 28-year-old rookie and, at this moment, the starter for the Baltimore Orioles. As you once wrote in someone\'s year book, what a long, strange trip it\'s been. Bio Name: Caleb Martin Joseph \xc2\xa0Number: 36Born: June 18,1986 (28 years old) in Nashville, TNHeight: 6\'3"" Weight: 180 lbsBats: Right  Throws: RightDrafted: 7th round by the Baltimore Orioles in the 2008 amateur draftSchool: Franklin High School (Tennessee)Lipscomb University (Nashville, TN)Contract: ($500,000 in 2014, rookie, free agent: 2020)Became an Oriole: draftedTwitter: @McGrattan17 Personal Caleb didn\'t want to go to Lipscomb University. It was a school right in his home town of Nashville. His father had attended the school in the 80s, playing baseball and basketball for the Bisons. His grandfather, on his mother\'s side, had played baseball there as well.    ""I wanted to try and go somewhere bigger,"" Joseph told MLB.com\'s David Wilson. ""I tried hard not to go there and I really didn\'t have any other offers.""    According to the Lipscomb University athletics website, it does seem that Arkansas, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt each took a look at Joseph. However, none were motivated enough to offer a scholarship. Lipscomb it was and it turned out to be a positive decision. After playing mostly shortstop in high school, Joseph switched to catching in college because it would allow him to play immediately. The shortstop at Lipscomb was Tadd Brewer, a young man who was two years older than Caleb and who would go on to be drafted by the Angels, but never make it to the big leagues.    In his final season at Lipscomb, Joseph led the team to it\'s first Atlantic Sun Conference Tournament and they won the championship, qualifying for the NCAA Tournament. After just three years, Joseph was drafted by the Orioles. It was no surprise as the Orioles showed the most interest, followed by the Diamondbacks. Back in 2008, Joseph\'s college coach said that the O\'s came to see him ""two or three times"" and that their ""cross-checker"" scout even gave him the OK. He was set to head to Baltimore. But that first game in an Oriole uniform was a long way away.    His career down on the farm began normally enough. He torched through short-season Aberdeen and high-A Frederick in two seasons. After 2009 he was named the Orioles tenth best prospect and the best defensive catcher in the organization. Onward he went to Bowie, double-A, the fast track for the majors. There he would spend most of the next four seasons, playing 428 games and breaking the club record for number of games played. Not exactly a number you want your name next to for a minor league squad. His only refuge was a 22-game stint with Norfolk in the middle of the 2012 season. However, he only managed to hit .202 there without a single home run. Back to Bowie it was. Those two years in Bowie, 2012 and 2013, were arguably the best of his minor league career. Especially 2013 where he hit .299 with 22 home runs, 97 RBI, made the Eastern League All-Star game, and won the home run derby at the event. He was even named Eastern League Player of the year. However, he still would not warrant even a September call-up. In fact, the Orioles left him off of the 40-man roster. But they were not alone in their indifference towards Joseph. No other team selected him in December\'s Rule Five draft in which the O\'s chose Michael Almanzar. It seemed that Joseph was set to stay at Bowie another year and was reaching his breaking point. That is where his wife, Brook stepped in.    In January, Joseph married Brooke\xc2\xa0at\xc2\xa0a ceremony in Nashville. The couple had met one another through mutual friends they knew from college. Caleb\'s proposal took place in front of friends and family at the Botanical Gardens in Maryland several months before the wedding. Brooke pushed Caleb to keep playing. He wanted to quit and get away from baseball. He felt his age and the uncertainty of a minor league baseball life was getting to be too much. ""I\'d be lying if I didn\'t tell you that, just about once a week, I thought about hanging it up,"" Joseph told the Baltimore Sun. Lucky for him, he kept pushing. And for that, he is quickly becoming a fan favorite and someone that the Orioles need to keep around, at least when Kevin Gausman pitches. Quick Hits  His catcher\'s ERA is 2.72 (league average is 3.79) Joseph is a baseball addict. He didn\'t have a favorite superhero as a kid because his parents would only let him watch sports. He would spend hours in front of the television watching the Atlanta Braves on TBS and the Chicago Cubs on WGN His favorite player growing up was Fred McGriff Joseph was once a clubhouse attendant for the Triple-A Nashville Sounds (Brewers affiliate). He once ran into Adam Jones at a Sounds game. Jones was playing for the Mariners affiliate, Tacoma. When Joseph was with Frederick, he would sleep in the clubhouse a lot of nights. His apartment didn\'t have a television or internet so he would watch games at the stadium and sleep on the couch.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 It seemed like every time the Baltimore Orioles were poised to score, the Chicago White Sox would squelch the threat \xe2\x80\x94 two outs at a time.The Orioles hit into four double plays Tuesday night, including the game-ender in a 4-2 defeat.Jose Quintana (4-7) allowed only one run in seven innings for the White Sox, but the left-hander and three relievers benefited greatly from Baltimore\'s lack of clutch hitting. The Orioles stranded seven and went 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position.""We squared up a couple balls early,"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""But there wasn\'t a lot of good contact off (Quintana). Not real comfortable at-bats.""Quintana (4-7) gave up six hits \xe2\x80\x94 including a solo homer by Steve Pearce \xe2\x80\x94 struck out eight and walked three. The left-hander was 0-3 in four starts since May 26.Nick Markakis, who went 0 for 4 against Quintana with two strikeouts, said, ""He\'s a guy that short arms the ball and the ball jumps out of his hand. It is tough to get in a rhythm when you don\'t see the ball behind his back and he short arms it with good velocity.""One night after blowing a ninth-inning lead in the series opener, White Sox closer Ronald Belisario entered in the ninth with no outs and a runner on first. He allowed a pinch-hit RBI single to Delmon Young before getting pinch-hitter Ryan Flaherty to bounce into a double play.Belisario\'s eighth save sealed a much-needed victory for the White Sox, who had lost five in a row overall and eight straight on the road.""When you have the opportunity, you have to win those games,"" Chicago left fielder Alejandro De Aza said. ""We have to enjoy it because it doesn\'t happen very often.""Miguel Gonzalez (4-5) yielded three runs and a career-high tying nine hits in five innings for Baltimore. It was his second start since returning from a 17-day stint on the disabled list with a strained right oblique, and like the last one, he failed to get into the sixth inning.""Bent but didn\'t break. Kept us engaged in the game. Gave us some chances,"" Showalter said. ""His command was off from what we\'ve come to expect. He fought his way through five innings.""Two batters into the game, Gonzalez and the Orioles fell behind for good when Gordon Beckham drove a fastball into the seats in left field for his seventh home run.Chicago added a run in the second when Ramirez doubled and scored on a single by De Aza. The inning ended with a poorly executed double steal in which De Aza was nailed at the plate after getting a late start from third base.Three straight two-out singles, the last by Tyler Flowers, made it 3-0 in the fourth.The White Sox loaded the bases with no outs in the fifth before Alexei Ramirez hit a popup and Dayan Viciedo bounced into a double play.After Pearce homered leading off the sixth, Adam Jones doubled.

The White Sox defeated the Orioles 4-2. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles, like many teams in this strange season of parody and surprises, have had the unusual experience of not consistently winning at Camden Yards. Who would have expected this?With the loss to the White Sox last night, the Orioles are now 17-18 at home and 23-18 on the road. Stated as relative to playing .500 baseball, they are home/road -1 / +4.\xc2\xa0 In 2013, it would be +11 / -3.\xc2\xa0 In 2012, it was +13 / +11.\xc2\xa0 And in 2011, the last of the horrible seasons, the Orioles were only three games under .500 at home.Oriole Park at Camden Yards should really favor a power team like the O\xe2\x80\x99s. So this is a weird statistic that defies easy explanation. Yes, the pitching has too frequently not been the best, but honestly, the Orioles have not hit and scored well at home either.The Baltimore Orioles have the second highest team batting average in the American League at .265. But this is about the only category where they are at the top. Even though they have had decent numbers with runners in scoring position, that has to be skewed by having many of those hits come in non-critical situations.When one studies and looks more deeply into the many metrics of offensive production (such as these advanced statistics), the Orioles are very much a middle of the pack team in most categories. For example, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are eighth in the AL in average runs scored per game \xe2\x80\x93 an admittedly important statistic, since that is what determines who wins or loses!Last night\xe2\x80\x99s game (Tuesday 6/24, 4-2 loss to the White Sox) illustrates some of the frustration in one small sample. They were 9-for-32 (.281) with four walks (OPB of .361), but were then 1-for-9 with RISP and hit into four double plays.

He has kept the Orioles in four of his past five games \xe2\x80\x93 giving them a shot at winning, but sadly the Birds have only won three of his starts this entire season.The current White Sox lineup is a combined 44-ofr-160 (.275) against Jimenez, who is seeking his first win at Camden Yards. In nine career starts against Chicago he is 2-3 with a 4.92 ERA.Hector Noesi (2-5, 5.34) will pitch for the White Sox. He is 0-2 against the Orioles who have totally clobbered him in just 6.1 innings with 15 hits. However, current Orioles are only 8-for-30 against him. Adam Jones and Nelson Cruz have each hit a home run.Here is the Baltimore Orioles lineup, which has Ryan Flaherty and Nick Hundley starting \xe2\x80\xa6Nick Markakis \xe2\x80\x93 RFSteve Pearce \xe2\x80\x93 LFAdam Jones \xe2\x80\x93 CFChris Davis \xe2\x80\x93 1BNelson Cruz \xe2\x80\x93 DHJ.J.

06/26/2014,"[('Surveying the Orioles Near the Halfway Mark', 'Jun 25, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles designated hitter Nelson Cruz (23) is interviewed after a game against the Chicago White Sox at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles defeated the White Sox 5-4 in twelve innings. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe, but the Baltimore Orioles have played 77 games at this point, and by the time they finish their four-game set with the Rays this weekend, which includes a doubleheader on Friday, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will be right at 81 games.So, at the halfway point, what can we say about the Orioles? The O\xe2\x80\x99s right now are 1.5 behind the Jays, and that will soon be 2 games. But they are right in the thick of the division and also the wild card hunt.Hitting: BLet\xe2\x80\x99s first look at some numbers. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are third in the majors in batting average and third in home runs. Neither of those numbers are shocking, the O\xe2\x80\x99s were expected to be a good hitting team. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are right near average at on-base percentage, which is notable for the team of sluggers.Nelson Cruz has carried the offense so far this year. Manny Machado is struggling after coming back from his injury, and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t performed as expected. Adam Jones surged through June and is playing at his normal level. Nick Markakis is having his best season in a few years. Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 average is much lower than last year, and it has been a bit of a struggle for him as well, although it appears that is changing. Second base has been a bit of a struggle, but Steve Pearce has been a revelation for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Overall, the team needs to do a better job of manufacturing runs, as they are relying on the home runs too much, as usual.Starting Pitching: CEveryone questioned whether the Orioles could pitch their way to the pennant this year. And after the first two months, the answer appeared to be no. But in the last month, the O\xe2\x80\x99s starting pitching has done pretty well. The O\xe2\x80\x99s starters are one of the worst rotations as far as striking batters out, which is partly because their pitchers aren\xe2\x80\x99t strike-out pitchers. Their ERA is 22nd overall, but let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest, in the AL East that is not surprising.Ubaldo Jimenez has been the worst pitcher on the staff, Chris Tillman has been inconsistent, and so has Miguel Gonzalez, although not as drastically as Tillman. Wei-Yin Chen has been quite good, despite not going deep in games. Bud Norris has been fantastic, but is dealing with a groin injury right now. However, he has been excellent for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Kevin Gausman currently is pitching the way the O\xe2\x80\x99s expected him to, and if he can keep it up, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have a great chance.Relief Pitching: BI originally gave the bullpen a B, but then I remembered the early season closing struggles. Since Zach Britton became the closer and Tommy Hunter healthy and back in a 7th inning role, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen has been good. The Orioles have the 6th most innings pitched among relievers, and rank around the middle in every statistic. However, there are a few particular outings that have brought those numbers down a good bit.Now, the long relief continues to be an issue, but that is a problem many teams have. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day has been excellent and Ryan Webb has rebounded from his tough start. The O\xe2\x80\x99s pen isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly where it was in 2012, but it is better than 2013, and has been quite good.Fielding: B-This B-minus is not compared to everyone else; it is compared to the standard the Orioles have set for themselves defensively. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are third in fielding percentage, have the most double plays by quite a margin, and lead the majors in outfield assists.But J.J. Hardy has struggled for the Orioles compared to his normal Gold Glove level, and Manny Machado started slowly as well, although his defense is now back to normal. Nelson Cruz has been pretty good at LF compared to what many expected, and Caleb Joseph has been a revelation in place of Matt Wieters, showing the O\xe2\x80\x99s backups at catcher are not a black hole.Overall, missing Matt Wieters is going to hurt the O\xe2\x80\x99s as they move forward. But if they can get Manny Machado and Chris Davis trending back toward last year\xe2\x80\x99s numbers, it will be a good sign. But, it all hinges on the starting pitching, if they keep up what they have been doing, the team will likely be headed to the playoffs for the second time in three years. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Birds Watcher: Baltimore Orioles ""Cruz"" to a wild finish', 'When fans look back on this game they might do so thinking that the Baltimore Orioles probably had no business winning. In fact, they easily could have been swept in the series had one or two things in this game (and Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game) bounced the other way. Starting pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez was good \xe2\x80\x93 not great, but good. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.1 IP, 8 H, 4 R, 2 BB, 6 K. There were times when Jimenez found trouble, but yet other times when he was right on the ball. His walks were obviously down, but he allowed a lot of base runners with the eight hits. It may be a tough start to really gauge, but he did in fact give the O\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to win.Jose Abreu put Jimenez and the Birds in a 1-0 hole when he led off the fourth inning with a solo home run. An inning later De Aza\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-triple would give the ChiSox a 2-0 lead, on a ball that just hung, and hung \xe2\x80\x93 and hung a bit more in the air. However De Aza also helped Jimenez out a few moments later when Gordon Beckham shot a ground ball to third baseman Manny Machado. I was a bit taken back when De Aza broke for home on contact, however Machado threw to catcher Nick Hundley who applied the tag to get the Birds a key out at home plate. Flowers would send a two-RBI single to left field in the seventh and the Birds were in a 4-0 hole.This was another case of the Orioles not having patience at the plate. In fairness, many scouting reports on the ChiSox indicated that their pitchers threw strikes \xe2\x80\x93 often catching perhaps too much of the plate. But the scouting reports on the Orioles state that they\xe2\x80\x99re a free-swinging bunch. So Chicago pitchers were throwing pitches out of the strike zone \xe2\x80\x93 and that worked out well for them for the most part. Until of course it didn\xe2\x80\x99t.The Birds didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a base runner at second base or beyond until the last of the eighth inning, when Nick Markakis and Nick Hundley led the inning off with back-to-back singles. Chris Davis drew a two-out walk and the bases were loaded. On a side note, the Orioles for so many years were victims of wild moments in games whereby they might have a decent lead (such as 4-0) late in the game only to have to bear witness to big moments in games by their opponents. So now perhaps the shoe\xe2\x80\x99s on the other foot\xe2\x80\xa6Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sports\xe2\x80\xa6there did appear to be a certain energy in Oriole Park at Camden Yards as Nelson Cruz strode to the plate with the bases loaded. As thunder and lightning struck off in the distance indicating an arriving storm, the Camden Yards faithful seemed to sense that something magic was about to happen. And Nelson Cruz rose to the occasion, sending a grand slam off of the grounds crew shed in right field which tied the game.Short of a walk off home run (which we also saw from the Orioles in this series), you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have a more exciting moment than something like that in a game. As the last out was recorded in the ninth and the game went to extra innings, the umpires called for the tarp as the storm was about to hit. If Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s slam didn\xe2\x80\x99t wash away the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offensive ineffectiveness, it was certainly possible that the rain would.With neither team challenging too much in the first few extra innings, Nick Hundley drew a lead off walk in the last of the twelfth. Buck Showalter immediately inserted David Lough as a pinch runner for his speed, and Lough was able to go first-to-third on Nick Marakkis\xe2\x80\x99 subsequent single. As often happens in extra innings, one team waits for the other to make a mistake. And that mistake came in the form of Chicago reliever Daniel Webb\xe2\x80\x98s wild pitch, which allowed Lough to come in from third to score the winning run.The Orioles emptied their bullpen in this game, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re ever going to have to do that you\xe2\x80\x99d like it to be in a game going into an off day. Again, the stats and the ebb and flow of the game (until the eighth inning that is) indicate that the O\xe2\x80\x99s should have lost last night. However perhaps one of the marks of good teams is that they find ways to win when they aren\xe2\x80\x99t at theirCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportsbest.The Orioles will send pitcher Bud Norris in for an MRI this morning on his groin, which he appeared to injure on Saturday at Yankee Stadium.  Buck Showalter said that Norris appeared \xe2\x80\x9ctentative\xe2\x80\x9d in his side session so they just want to be sure.  Manny Machado had his appear hearing yesterday at Camden Yards, and both he and Dan Duquette (who attended the hearing) said they felt it went well. The Orioles are hoping to get Machado\xe2\x80\x99s suspension reduced to two or three games if possible. One way or the other, their hope is that Machado will continually be available to them for Friday\xe2\x80\x99s doubleheader. Having said that, I will say that if the suspension happens to be reduced to two games (which I feel might be a reach), they could get the entire thing out of the way tomorrow during the doubleheader and move on from there.

And yes, I understand that this affirms Dempsey\xe2\x80\x99s main point \xe2\x80\x93 that from the perspective of the pitching team, nothing good happens, as proven by the events that gave the Oriole this series-winning 5-4 victory.Speaking of the mere five hits in 30 innings with RISP, one of those hits this evening was the eighth inning grand slam of Nelson Cruz to right field that erased the 4-0 Chicago lead. The Orioles could get nothing off the Sox starter Hector Noesi, who demonstrated the pitching wisdom and skill in pounding the bottom half of the strike zone. It was the most pitch efficient effort seen in a Baltimore Orioles game (by either side) this season. There is a lesson to be learned in it.

He tried a crab mac-and-cheese dog with the ballpark\xe2\x80\x99s executive chef, Josh Distenfeld, and had nothing but praise for it.But where Camden Yards distinguished itself was in its ballpark score.He said other ballparks, such as AT&T; Park in San Francisco, muddle the retro feel with gimmicks like kids areas and special attractions.Those parks try to be too much, he said, while Camden Yards \xe2\x80\x9cis a baseball stadium.

06/28/2014,"[('Orioles - The Baltimore Wire', 'Jun 27, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles catcher Nick Hundley (40) is congratulated by third base coach Bobby Dickerson (11) after hitting a solo home run in the sixth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles defeated the Rays 4-1. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAYThe Baltimore Orioles split a doubleheader on Friday with the Tampa Bay Rays. Even though playing the team with the poorest record in all of baseball, it remains difficult to win both ends of a twin bill.Kevin Gausman was simply not sharp in the opener which the Orioles lost to the Rays by a final of 5-2. He was charged with all the runs scored on seven hits along with four walks. He looked like a guy who has been up and down from the minors and now was out of a routine. It clearly seems to be time for a regular rotation routine to be established for the second half of the season. His adversary \xe2\x80\x93 rookie Alex Colome \xe2\x80\x93 had the baseball day of his life thus far. He held the Orioles to one run on two hits through 5.2 innings. Again, the Birds seem unable to figure out a new pitcher or one who has some plus stuff working on that day.Manny Machado did get his fifth home run of the season in the seventh inning, but it is difficult to win games when a team only tallies a total of three hits.The evening game was a much more pleasant experience for the Orioles and their fans as the Birds pulled out a 4-1 victory. Chris Tillman performed at his most efficient best. He threw fewer pitches in four innings in this game than he tossed in the first inning alone of several other notorious outings this year. His final numbers were eight innings with only four hits and a single walk. Pounding the strike zone on the inside and outside of the plate \xe2\x80\xa6 this is the key to solid pitching. Hopefully all the others took note of this approach, though doing it successfully is probably where the devil is in the details. The O\xe2\x80\x99s had 3 hits in game one; Jones had 4 hits in game two!Each team scored a single run in the second inning, and so the score stood at 1-1 until Nick Hundley got all of a pitch in the bottom of the sixth inning for his first Orioles home run. And Nelson Cruz would double the score in the next inning, driving in Adam Jones who had doubled ahead of him for his fourth base hit of the evening. Yes the whole team had three hits in game one, and Adam Jones had four (out of 10 team hits) in the second game.And yes, Adam Jones was a steal for the Orioles when they traded for him after the 2007 season, giving up Erik Bedard as the major piece of the deal. So Bedard (3-5, 4.25) returns to the familiar confines of Camden Yards for today\xe2\x80\x99s 4:05 game three of the series.Bedard has not actually pitched in Baltimore since June 14, 2012 with the Pirates, where the Orioles lit him up for seven runs over 3.1 innings. Tommy Hunter was the starting pitcher for the Orioles that day \xe2\x80\x93 remember when he used to do that?Bedard\xe2\x80\x99s next most recent game against the Orioles was just 10 days ago in Florida where the O\xe2\x80\x99s beat him by scoring five runs in four innings, including a Chris Davis grand slam.The current Orioles lineup has a .275 average against Bedard, with Adam Jones the highest at 6-for-13. Nick Markakis is 5-for-12 with Davis 4-for-10. Nelson Cruz has the most at-bats with 23 that include seven hits and two homers. We certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t be seeing Delmon Young today \xe2\x80\x93 not after Buck sees that he is 2-for-21 over his career against the personality-deprived Canadian.The Orioles will start Wei-Yin Chen for the 16th time this year, and he enters with a 7-2 record with a 3.84 ERA. He has pitched twice against the Rays this year, giving up four runs on 11 hits in 13 innings.

Even though Gausman departed earlier than desired, Evan Meek and Brad Brach threw two shutout innings each. And only a single (save situation) inning was needed from Zach Britton in the second game. So the rest of the bullpen is well-rested for today\xe2\x80\x99s contest.The Jays, Yankees, and Orioles all have 37 losses at this point of the season.

The Taiwanese left-hander was 4-0 in nine starts since May 3 and 1-0 with a 2.77 ERA in two games against Tampa Bay.None of that mattered following one of the worst performances of his three-year career with Baltimore. His fourth pitch was hit into the left-field seats by Desmond Jennings, and things went downhill from there.""I knew that from the beginning I wasn\'t able to pinpoint my pitches well, locating my pitches in the zone, and I started to think too much about a lot of things,"" Chen said through a translator. ""I wasn\'t really locating like I am supposed to be.""Of the 15 home runs Chen has yielded this season, five have come against the light-hitting Rays. Tampa Bay started the day tied for 25th in the majors with 59 home runs and hit only two in its previous nine games.""For every game, you don\'t want to give up any home runs,"" Chen said. ""Lately, I\'ve been leaving more pitches up in the zone. Maybe the opponent hitters are studying me more than they used to, so if I didn\'t make the adjustment necessary, the results are going to look bad. So I\'m going to look at that.""Tampa Bay used two-run homers by Logan Forsythe and rookie Kevin Kiermaier to build a five-run cushion in the fourth inning, then held off a late comeback bid to improve to 3-8 against the Orioles this season.Nick Markakis and Manny Machado homered for the Orioles, who have a major league-leading 40 long balls in June. But it wasn\'t enough to beat the last-place Rays, who can win the four-game series with a victory Sunday.Former Oriole Erik Bedard (4-5) struck out seven in a season-high seven-plus innings. The 35-year-old lefty gave up three runs and five hits against the team he began his career with in 2002.He walked none, and 68 of his 87 pitches were strikes.""That\'s probably the best strike-ball ratio I\'ve ever thrown in my life,"" Bedard said. ""The biggest thing was the first-pitch strikes and after that, I continued to throw strikes. I mixed in fastball, changeup, curveball and I came out on top.""He was pulled after giving up a two-run homer to Manny Machado in the eighth.Adam Jones added an RBI single off Jake McGee, who subsequently retired Nelson Cruz with two outs and runners on the corners. McGee returned in the ninth to earn his third save \xe2\x80\x94 the second in two days.The Rays got all the offense they needed at Chen\'s expense. After Jennings hit his seventh career leadoff homer to give Tampa Bay the lead for good, Sean Rodriguez singled with one out in the second and Forsythe followed with his first home run in 142 at-bats this season. Forsythe went 3 for 3 with a walk and scored twice.Tampa Bay made it 5-0 in the fourth when Forsythe singled and Kiermaier drove a 1-2 pitch into the right-field bleachers. It was the fifth home run of the season for Kiermaier and the first by a left-hander against Chen.Bedard retired 10 straight batters before Markakis homered in the sixth.NOTES: Miguel Gonzalez will start for Baltimore in the series finale against RHP Alex Cobb, who has held the Orioles to a .176 batting average throughout his career. ...

""The (bullpen has) been doing a good job, and I just feel like I let them down.""The 12 runs and 18 hits were the most allowed by Baltimore this season.""Times like this, you\'d like to come out with a W when you score seven runs,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.The pitching, in a word, was horrible.""Really, as a group today,"" Showalter said. ""We\'ve just got to work our way out of it.

His five hits and 12 total bases tied club records.Although the Orioles finally got Joyce out in the ninth with the outcome already decided, his 5-for-6 performance upped his batting average 15 points to .274.""You really don\'t have very many days like that,"" Joyce said. ""It\'s nice to have one of those days and enjoy it.""Alex Cobb (3-6) got the win despite giving up four runs and eight hits in five innings.Manny Machado and Ryan Flaherty homered for the Orioles. Flaherty hit a three-run drive in the ninth to snap an 0-for-16 skid.The game turned in the seventh, when the Rays set season highs with seven runs and seven hits. After Kiermaier homered off Meek (0-3), Joyce singled in a run and James Loney delivered a two-run double. Brandon Guyer followed with an RBI double and Forsythe capped the barrage with a two-run homer off Matusz.In the eighth, Joyce hit a shot to right to make it 12-4 and complete his third career two-homer game.

06/30/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: No Beast in this AL East', 'Jun 29, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles shortstop Ryan Flaherty (3) celebrates with Jonathan Schoop (6) after hitting a three-run home run in the ninth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Rays won 12-7. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt is generally understood that the American League East is, year in and year out, the most difficult division in baseball. This has created some major challenges for the Baltimore Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 given the spending habits of the Yankees and Red Sox, and the player development skills of the Rays.But it is difficult in 2014 to find the beast in the east. Who would have believed you if you said just three months ago that the Orioles would finish the first half of the season with a 42-39 record but be only 1.5 games out of first place?The combined records of the AL East teams are 9 games under .500. The AL Central is 1 game under, while the AL West is the best in all of MLB with 19 games above .500.In the National League, there is some consolation in knowing the NL East is even worse at 11 games under .500, the NL Central is 18 games above, while the NL West is the worst in all of baseball with 16 games below .500.Putting this all together, the combined records of American League teams are a total of nine games better than the National League.The Baltimore Orioles are on a pace at this moment to end the season actually a game worse than in 2013. This is not what we thought we were going to see in 2014. The good news is that the AL East has been uncharacteristically bad, along with the hopes that the powerful Orioles lineup will simply perform at a much higher level. It is certainly possible, even as the grievous truth is that a great opportunity to run away from the division early in the season has been squandered.Brief Reflections on Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s GameIt was simply a terrible pitching display for the Baltimore Orioles. There is no doubt that the Tampa Bay Rays lineup is among the poorest-hitting teams in MLB. The O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching staff made them look like the 1927 Yankees in giving up 18 hits, including six doubles and five home runs! Matt Joyce \xe2\x80\x93 who was 5-for-6 with two homers, a double, and four RBIs, has to be terribly sad that he is leaving Baltimore.Over and over the Orioles pitchers allowed balls that were up in the strike zone. Miguel Gonzalez set the pattern by only pitching for 14 outs \xe2\x80\x93 his third consecutive poor start since the DL experience. It is difficult to be angry with Gonzalez, who has given about as much bang for the buck as anyone the Orioles have. But I still believe he is a long reliever by talent.It is also difficult to be too angry with the bullpen staff. They have been stellar in the last week or so in giving up only one run in 30 innings. Something had to break.At play is the old domino effect. And Buck Showalter hit the nail on the head pretty well by saying in his post-game comments, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t keep running the same people out there night after night, and our starters know that and they take it very personal. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to execute well enough to get done what they wanted to get done. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a domino effect on a lot of different things. Plus, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve played basically three day games in a row and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got teams standing around on the field for that long, it affects a lot of people.\xe2\x80\x9dMonday Night \xe2\x80\x93 Game 1 with the Texas RangersThe Orioles will begin a four-game series with the Texas Rangers at the Yard tonight. Ubaldo Jimenez will throw against the old friend of the O\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 Joe Saunders.Saunders enters the game with an 0-4 record on the season and 5.19 ERA. This will be his eighth game since joining the Rangers. On June 3rd of this year in Texas, he gave up just two runs on 10 hits over six innings against the Orioles in a no-decision.A lot of the O\xe2\x80\x99s have good numbers against Saunders. Nelson Cruz is 11-for-35 with a double and two homers, J.J. Hardy is 3-for-11 with a homer, Nick Markakis is 9-for-32, Delmon Young is 4-for-13 with a double and homer, and Adam Jones also has a double and homer on 7-for-22.On the other hand Chris Davis is 4-for-21 with a homer, Steve Pearce is 1-for-5 (so play Young!) and Manny Machado is 2-for-10 \xe2\x80\x93 so maybe this would be a good first day to sit out with suspension time.What more can be said about Ubaldo than what we and everyone else has written? When he controls his walks, his stuff is good enough to keep him in most any game. And the Orioles need a long outing from him to give the bullpen a break. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be at the game also, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to not go crazy with wild pitching and a terribly late night.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- Orioles third baseman Manny Machado began serving a five-game suspension Monday, nearly three weeks after Major League Baseball initially levied the sentence and five days after his appeal hearing.Machado was suspended and fined on June 10 for intentionally throwing his bat on the field during an at-bat in Baltimore's game against Oakland on June 8. Machado immediately appealed the suspension, and spoke for about an hour Wednesday in an appeal hearing in Baltimore with MLB official Joe Garagiola Jr.The initial decision was upheld, meaning Machado will miss the Orioles' four-game series against visiting Texas that began Monday, along with Friday night's game in Boston.''When we went in for an appeal I thought we had a good case, we had a great case,'' Machado said Monday afternoon. ''We said what we had to say. It didn't come out how we wanted it to, but going into the appeal you know it's going to be 50-50. It's something you can't control. I think we did the right thing, it's a flip of the coin and we came up short. ... So now we're just going to have to deal with the consequences.''So will the Orioles, who will be forced to play with a 24-man roster. Chris Davis, who usually plays first base, was at third base on Monday night.''That's the worst part about it. We're down a man,'' Machado said. ''Obviously I don't want to put my team in that situation, especially five tough games.''Machado tossed his bat in the direction of third base during a plate appearance in which Oakland reliever Fernando Abad threw successive high-and-tight pitches. After the bat went soaring, both benches emptied. Machado and Abad were ejected.Abad was fined but not suspended.''I didn't throw the bat at the pitcher. I didn't harm anybody. And I'm going to get five games,'' Machado said. ''I didn't charge the mound. I didn't get in a fight. ... This is an unfortunate event and I'm going to have to deal with it.''Orioles executive vice president Dan Duquette said: ''Obviously, we were disappointed. We were hoping the suspension would be reduced, and we thought there were good reasons it should have been reduced.''In the opener of that series against the Athletics on June 6, Machado yelled in the face of Oakland's Josh Donaldson after the third baseman tagged him on the chest and caused him to lose his balance. Both benches emptied, but there were no ejections.''It sounded like they were giving him four games for the bat and they were also giving him an additional game for the Friday night,'' Duquette said. ''I hadn't heard of a case where they went back and retroactively apply a suspension. ... The umpires didn't recommend any discipline; Manny stayed in the game. So that was kind of puzzling.''Machado, 21, said he learned a lesson from the experience.''Don't do it again,'' he said. ''You don't want to be in this situation. No one wants to be in it. We'll just go from here and try to put this behind me and just go on playing baseball.''Orioles manager Buck Showalter hoped the five-game sentence would be lowered after the appeal, but was ready to move on after the punishment remained in place.''It was surprising,'' Showalter said. ''We're not going to dwell on it. We understand the rules and why things are in place for different reasons. There are repercussions for actions in baseball as there are in life in general. Hopefully, there will be some positive that comes out of it where Manny is concerned in the future and for all players, managers and coaches.''Machado missed the first month of the 2014 season recovering from offseason knee surgery and got off to a slow start at the plate. Just before Monday's suspension, however, he had 10 hits over an eight-game span to raise his batting average 15 points to .239, and he also hit three home runs in his previous four starts.That made the timing of the suspension even tougher to take.''Definitely. It just (stinks),'' he said. ''I was starting to feel a little better at the plate and here they come with that bomb, five games. It was going to come. It was just about time to come. Unfortunately it came in the wrong spot, but hey, nothing you can do about it.''

', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Update on Dylan Bundy - Camden Chat, a Baltimore Orioles ...', ' On Friday night, Dylan Bundy made his third rehab start with the Aberdeen Ironbirds. Of course, he shut down the New York Penn League opposition again and I was there to witness the game in all its glory. He threw five shutout innings while allowing three hits and two walks. He racked up seven strikeouts on the evening, but the results really aren\'t that important. A pitcher of Bundy\'s caliber should slice through a lineup of hitters who are mainly getting their first taste of minor league baseball.    What I really wanted to see on Friday night was how Dylan was throwing after returning from an almost year long rehab process after Tommy John surgery. It had been a couple of years since I had seen him in person, but having seen him before I had a point of reference to compare his stuff to which was helpful. Bundy, who is still only 21 years old, certainly looked good but he\'s not all the way back to his pre-surgery form. The velocity on his fastball ranged from 90-93 while topping out at 94. Even though he\'s only 6\'1"", which isn\'t exceptionally tall for a pitcher he is able to get strong downward plane on his fastball due to a high three quarters delivery. His velocity pre-surgery was definitely a couple ticks faster when he sat 94-96. While his velocity is down, Bundy is going to have to command the pitch to both sides of the plate, which he was able to do in this outing. I would expect more velocity to come back as he continues to get further away from the surgery. Friday night was the one year anniversary of the TJ surgery so he\'s still in recovery mode. The pitch isn\'t in the elite velocity range right now, but it could be once his arm is full strength. The return of his pre-surgery velocity is definitely something to keep an eye on. Right now, he\'ll have to rely on command and movement to get hitters out with the pitch. It\'s a little straight but even at the decreased velo range, the pitch still has a lot of life.    Bundy\'s favorite secondary pitch on the night was old Uncle Charlie, the curveball. He threw a lot of them, even doubling up on them a few times. He was throwing them between 72-75 mph, which again is a few ticks below where he was a couple years ago. Even so, the curveball looked really good. He could manipulate the pitch to throw it for a strike or to bury it in the dirt when he was looking for a strikeout.    Out of his hand the curveball looks just like his fastball, which makes it extremely hard for the hitter to pick up. At this level, the batters had just about no chance. He did hang one in his last inning of work that Renegades\' right fielder Elias Torres was able to line down the left field line for a double. Torres\' liner was easily the hardest hit ball off of Bundy all night. It was an effective pitch otherwise, and he was able to steal a few strikes early in the count with it. He also was able to get a couple strikeouts on the pitch when the batter gave up on it, and it dropped in for a strike. His other secondary pitch is a change up. Last night, Bundy threw the change up 86-88 while only throwing a handful of them. While the velocity on his fastball is only in the low nineties, the delta between the two is not large enough to mess up the hitters timing. Either he\'s going to have to find the missing velo on his fastball or he\'s going to have to take something off of his change. Ideally, you\'d like to have a difference of about 10 mph between a fastball and change up.    This is the pitch that needs the most work. Right now, it\'s a little too firm which causes the pitch not to drop as much as it would at a lower velocity range. On Friday night there just wasn\'t enough movement on it or enough separation from his fastball. He didn\'t throw more than a handful but one was lined sharply to center field for a single. I\'ve read all of his post game comments and I haven\'t seen a single reference to it, but it certainly looked like he was throwing a cutter too. The pitch was thrown in about the same velocity band as his change up but had glove side and downward movement. It\'s possible that once Bundy made it to the major leagues that the team took the shackles off. I\'m not sure how the organization feels about him throwing it now, but they had told him not to throw it in the past. Even during that time, he would uncork one every once in a while and it was awesome. The pitch I saw on Friday was still good, but it wasn\'t jaw dropping like a couple years ago. I\'d guess that it\'ll come back the more he throws it and the further removed from surgery he gets. That will be another thing to keep an eye on.    Orioles Director of Player Development Brian Graham watched the game from the dugout and after the game revealed part of the plan for Bundy this season. Per\xc2\xa0Steve Melewski:  ""It\'s going to be a 75-pitch limit, you know, all the way through the summer,"" he said. ""I don\'t see it going much above 75, if it does. That is the way you do it on a ligament rehab. You get to a certain pitch level and you stay there for the whole season.""  It makes a lot of sense to bring him back slowly this season in his return, and then take the reins off next season. Any hope Orioles fans had of seeing Bundy start in the major leagues this season can probably end now. If we see him with the big club this year, it\'ll almost certainly be in relief. It was obvious to everyone in attendance that Bundy isn\'t challenged by the NYPL and needs to face stiffer competition. To that end, the Orioles have announced that he\'ll be starting for the Frederick Keys on Thursday, July 3rd. I\'d expect him to make three to four starts there before moving on to Bowie. I was pleased to see that he\'s pretty close to what he was before and the surgery certainly seems like a success. There is still a lot to be excited about with him. The surgery didn\'t take away what looks like an extremely bright future.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Series Preview: Baltimore Orioles vs. Texas Rangers, 30 ...', "" Monday, June 30, 7:05 ET: Ubaldo Jimenez vs. Joe Saunders      Jimenez Saunders   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 182.2 88.0 183.0 34.2   ERA 3.30 4.70 5.26 5.19   FIP 3.43 4.74 4.72 5.09   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .239/.317/.367 .255/.363/.391 .311/.365/.507 .356/.424/.517         Jimenez had mediocre results in his last start, surrendering four runs in 6.1 innings, but his peripherals looked better than they have in about a month, as he struck out six while walking just two. He's still given up the most walks of any pitcher in the majors, but if he can limit them to two or three per game for a while, rather than five or six, maybe someone will pass him before the year is up. Saunders faced the O's (and Jimenez, in fact) earlier in the month and managed to allow just two runs, despite getting knocked around for ten hits in six innings. He's struggled in his last two starts, giving up thirteen runs (ten earned) and walking eight in 8.2 IP. The lefty's fastball sits in the upper 80s, and he doesn't get very many strikeouts. He throws fastballs more than anything else, mostly sinkers, though righties will see more four-seamers than lefties. Saunders will go offspeed with a slider against lefties and a changeup against righties, and he'll also drop in the occasional curveball against both. Maybe hot: Adam Jones (.900 OPS, 25 PA), Adrian Beltre (1.255 OPS, 22 PA)    Likely not: Nick Markakis (.561 OPS, 33 PA), Alex Rios (.403 OPS, 21 PA)    Tuesday, July 1, 7:05 ET: TBA vs. Nick Martinez      TBA Martinez   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP - - - 62.0   ERA - - - 4.65   FIP - - - 5.54   AVG/OBP/SLG Against - - - .304/.375/.490      Birdland's favorite starter TBA makes not one, but two reappearances this week. It's really anyone's guess who will start this game, with Bud Norris's DL trip and the doubleheader on Friday messing with the rotation. Perhaps T.J. McFarland will get a spot start - his only other major-league start was on June 28 last year, though he only made it through 2.2 innings.    Like Saunders, Martinez also faced the O's earlier this month. The latter did not fare as well, though, as he gave up six runs (four earned) over 5.1 IP. Martinez is not having a very successful rookie year - he's struck out fewer batters than he's walked, and his very low groundball rate (31.5%; league average: 45.3%) means he's also vulnerable to the long ball. The righty throws mostly fastballs, even though the pitch only sits around 91 mph. He's used his slider quite a bit against righties, showing some faith in it as an out pitch, while against lefties, he uses a changeup occasionally in all counts and a curve at times when he's ahead. Wednesday, July 2, 7:05 ET: Chris Tillman vs. Nick Tepesch      Tillman Tepesch   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 206.1 99.0 93.0 44.1   ERA 3.71 4.18 4.84 3.65   FIP 4.42 4.60 4.19 4.55   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .241/.303/.427 .253/.326/.407 .272/.330/.427 .254/.326/.420      Tillman's last four starts have been quite good results-wise, as he's allowed just five runs over 28 IP. The question is how he's been doing that, since he's walked more than he's struck out over that span (8 BB, 7 K). Perhaps he's figuring something out, and is managing to induce poor contact for now, but a sub-.200 BABIP in his last two games suggests he's been getting lucky. Tillman hasn't struck out more than three batters in a game in over a month now, and that can't last - either he'll start getting more whiffs, or opponents will start knocking him around again.    This will be the Orioles' first look at Tepesch; the only one who's faced him before is David Lough. The righty's having a good sophomore season, though his strikeout and walk rates suggest he's getting a bit lucky ERA-wise. Tepesch throws fastballs the majority of the time to both right- and left-handed batters; lefties see more sinkers than four-seamers, and vice-versa for righties. Offspeed-wise, he turns to his slider most often, though against lefties he'll also throw changeups to get ahead in the count and a curve unless he's behind. Maybe hot: Elvis Andrus (1.117 OPS, 14 PA) Likely not: Carlos Pena (.607 OPS, 13 PA) Thursday, July 3, 7:05 ET: TBA (Wei-Yin Chen?) vs. Yu Darvish      Chen(?) Darvish   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 137.0 92.1 209.2 104.1   ERA 4.07 4.19 2.83 2.42   FIP 4.04 4.39 3.28 2.64   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .272/.321/.440 .287/.318/.479 .194/.277/.334 .222/.292/.323      Chen got pummeled on Saturday, allowing five runs and three homers in 3.1 IP, the shortest start of his career. He's also walked five batters over his last three starts, after walking four batters over the previous eight. We're probably seeing some inevitable regression with Chen - it's tough to nearly cut your walk rate in half from one season to the next - but we should see some positive regression, too, as he's been a bit unlucky with home runs this season, and his strikeout rate could bounce back a little. Darvish is having his best season yet ERA-wise, and advanced stats only question his HR/FB rate, as his xFIP is 3.14, a half-run higher than his FIP. The righty's repertoire contains eight separate pitches according to Brooks Baseball, but his pitch selection is fairly conventional when you come down to it, using fastballs to get ahead and breaking pitches to finish batters off.

He brought in Tim McCarver, a keen analyst, to pair in the broadcasting booth with Ralph Kiner.But he made a major misstep in January 1984 when he failed to protect Tom Seaver, the future Hall of Fame pitcher, from a free-agent compensation draft, only to see him taken by the Chicago White Sox.The Mets finished second in their division in 1984, and they were second again in 1985 before vaulting to the World Series championship.Mr. Cashen made a sharp deal after the 1987 season when he obtained pitcher David Cone from the Kansas City Royals for Ed Hearn, a journeyman catcher, but the Mets would not win another pennant during his tenure.

We didn\'t know it at the time, but the pursuit of Norris was a month-long chase involving a number of teams.\xc2\xa0Monday\'s leak from the Astros rumor database shows just how many irons were in the fire at the time, and just how different the final trade was from some of the initial discussions.    The story is this: The Astros central database, part of a system they call Ground Control, was accessed and trade rumors from last year\'s deadline and offseason were placed on a leak website called Anonbin. It has not yet been determined whether this leak was internal, whether it was obtained by some kind of hacking exploit, or simply whether some poor sod had his dog\'s name as his password and someone accessed the database using that guess. Whatever it was, the result is that we get to enjoy this rare look into the anatomy of a baseball trade. The first Orioles-related entry in the leaked data is dated June 26, 2013, when Dan Duquette - referred to simply as ""DD"" - called Astros GM Jeff Luhnow to express ""continued"" interest in Norris. When that interest began is not in the leak. This is over a month before the trade was completed. It\'s no surprise that it took so long, given that Luhnow reportedly first asked for either Bundy or Gaussman (sic). Spelling and grammar mistakes are frequent in the database.    Gausman was a definite no, but according to the leaked information, Duquette said he had to check with his doctors on Bundy. That\'s probably because Bundy\'s Tommy John surgery was scheduled to take place on June 27, and presumably after it was completed without Bundy\'s arm accidentally being amputated, Duquette was no longer willing to entertain trading Bundy. Duquette is indicated as ruling out Bundy as a part of any trade on June 28, 2013.    A counter-offer presented by Duquette at this point was recorded as Mike Wright and Pedro Strop for Norris. Wright was a Double-A player at that time, in the midst of a solid season for the Bowie Baysox. Strop, out of favor and out of options on the Orioles major league club, ended up being sent to the Cubs less than a week later in the Scott Feldman trade. Over the next month, Luhnow had conversations with five other teams in which he proposed getting a top 100 prospect back in a trade. I guess it doesn\'t hurt to ask. Those teams who were reported to be at least somewhat interested in Norris to get in these conversations were the Pirates, Red Sox, Giants, Blue Jays, and Tigers. Juggling six teams for a month to pull off one trade sounds awfully complicated.    The idea of trading either Bundy or Gausman for a pitcher like Norris is laughable, and to fans of those other teams, the idea of names like Xander Bogaerts, Kyle Crick, or Aaron Sanchez having been included in a Norris trade probably is too. Little surprise that Luhnow whiffed in aspiring for that tier of prospect. A month to the day after that conversation about Bundy or Gausman, Duquette shows up in the database again, checking in to see whether there is any interest on the Astros side in having a trade that does not involve Bundy. The Astros said this was ""unlikely"", but that they\'d add to the trade to get Bundy. Nice try, Luhnow. Five days later, up against the deadline, the Bundy-less trade is exactly what happened. A July 25 conversation with Pittsburgh shows the Astros were interested in acquiring one of the competitive balance draft picks, with the #73 pick in this year\'s draft coming up in the midst of some unsuccessful haggling. The Astros end rejected a proposed Luis Heredia - the #53 prospect in baseball before last season, according to Baseball Prospectus - plus the #73 pick trade for Norris on July 28.    The rumors stop on July 29. There are no further tidbits about how the trade came down to being finalized. Were Duquette and Luhnow in frequent contact over the last couple of days, or did some scenario play out where Luhnow and Duquette got back in touch an hour before the trade deadline and frantically hashed out a trade, or the other way around? That will have to be left to the imagination. What\'s apparent is that there was some point where Luhnow realized he wasn\'t going to get anywhere with his aiming high. Teams didn\'t want Norris that much. Some may have moved on, like the Red Sox, who got Jake Peavy as part of a three-team trade where they gave up a young big leaguer but not a monster prospect like they deemed Bogaerts or Jackie Bradley. Norris was scratched from a scheduled start on July 30, 2013 in anticipation of a possible trade. Was he scratched with an Orioles trade in mind in particular, or were there still several teams in play? We can only imagine that as well. Given some of the names that Luhnow was asking for, it\'s a bit of a surprise to see what he actually received in return for Norris. A couple of the names that were linked with other teams were among their second-tier prospects, if not their top tier, and the Orioles didn\'t even really pony up a prospect at that level either. ESPN\'s Keith Law\xc2\xa0assessed the trade as the Astros getting ""a 4A position player who can get on base"" (L.J. Hoes) and ""a lottery ticket lefty with arm strength but a long ways to go"" (Josh Hader). Hoes has a .592 OPS in 32 games for the Astros this year. Hader is not regarded as one of the top 10 Astros prospects, though he\'s still getting results now that he\'s moved up to High-A in the Houston system at the age of 20. That\'s a way down from trying to get one of the top prospects in baseball, as the Astros tried to do throughout the saga.    Of course, the Orioles also offered the #37 overall pick, their pick in the draft\'s competitive balance Round A. Maybe that\'s what really pushed them over the top in getting Norris. They were unique among the suitors in being able and willing to offer a pick so high. The Astros used that pick to select University of Virginia outfielder Derek Fisher. Given how the Orioles offseason played out, they wouldn\'t have selected at #37 anyway; that pick would have been forfeited with the signing of Nelson Cruz if they hadn\'t already traded it. There were a lot of possible Norris trades out there. For any given trade, there are probably a lot of possible trades out there. Did desperation on the part of either the Orioles or the Astros lead to an unequal trade, or was it a fair trade? Good process can always have a bad result, so it\'s hard to say for sure. If Hader turns into the next Chris Sale, and Fisher is some kind of future Hall of Fame player, it\'s not going to look like a great deal for the Orioles in hindsight. If the young players flame out and Norris pitches key playoff games for the Orioles, it\'s not going to look like a great deal for the Astros, either. Norris wasn\'t exactly what the Orioles might have hoped in 2013, but through 14 starts in 2014, he\'s living up to the hope that he\'d be able to lock down a starting rotation spot for a couple of years. Norris has so far negated the platoon problem he experienced against lefty batters. If that proves to be a product of design rather than fortune, he should keep up his end of the bargain. Other teams still experiencing rotation struggles might then wish they\'d given up a little bit more to get Norris instead of the Orioles. Wouldn\'t that be something?    For now, it looks like the Orioles managed to get a useful starting pitcher in Norris while keeping their best pitching prospects. That looks pretty good. The Astros got a late-first round pick and a still-promising lefty, which probably also looks pretty good on their end.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles took to the sky again last evening to hit three home runs and win the second game of the Texas series by a score of 8-3. Hey, when you hit three or four homers each night, who needs the three-run bomb to make a difference?Actually, making a difference in every game is one play or two, here and there, that one team makes and another fails to accomplish.Tuesday night was an illustration of this very principle. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk short stops \xe2\x80\xa6In the bottom of the fourth inning with the bases loaded, Caleb Joseph hits a routine double-play grounder to short stop Elvis Andrus, who does not come up with the ball. The Rangers should have been out of the inning trailing the game by a 4-2 score. By the time the third out was recorded, the score was 8-2.In the top of the next inning \xe2\x80\x93 the fifth \xe2\x80\x93 with one out and a runner on first base, the same Elvis Andrus grounds a ball to Jonathan Schoop.

He was 5-1 with a 3.22 ERA at his AAA assignment this year \xe2\x80\x93 pitching in 16 games, starting a total of six of them.All of this is, of course, terrible news for the Baltimore Orioles. This is the sort of pitcher that will shut them out with only two hits over seven efficient innings \xe2\x80\xa6 something like that seems to often occur.The Orioles will go to Chris Tillman tonight. He is now 7-4 with a 4.18 ERA, and has given up only five runs on 23 hits in 28 innings over his past four starts. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s last start against Texas was on June 5th, and it was one of those two total disaster games he has pitched this season. He only lasted one inning, getting drilled for five runs on six hits and three walks.If you take away those two one-inning meltdowns from Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s record, he has a 2.82 ERA in the remaining games.Tillman is 3-1 / 4.66 ERA in five career starts against the Rangers. The current Texas roster is 15-for-68 against Tillman, but with three doubles and four homers. Elvis Andrus is 5-for-11, and Adrian Beltre is 4-for-9 with a home run. Alex Rios Carlos Pena, and Shin-Soo Choo are a combined 3-for-26, with Rios and Choo having a home run as their only hits.Here is the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 batting order for tonight \xe2\x80\x93 game #3 of the series, and #3 without Manny Machado\xe2\x80\xa6Nick Markakis RFSteve Pearce LFAdam Jones CFNelson Cruz DHChris Davis 1BJ.J.

Heck, last night\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles starter T.J. McFarland himself had been victimized on a occasion or two. However this year in spring training the Orioles did stretch him out a bit, knowing that there could come a day when they might need a spot start out of the bullpen. That day came last night. McFarland\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.0 IP, 7 H, 2 R, 0 BB, 2 K.Normally we\xe2\x80\x99d be here talking about\xc2\xa0another short outing by a starter, but the fact thatCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsMcFarland is generally the long man out of the pen for the Baltimore Orioles, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take a five inning outing. McFarland isn\xe2\x80\x99t a hard thrower, but he pitches-to-contact and records outs when need be.  As you can see by his pitching line above, McFarland only struck out two batters; hence he pitches-to-contact. The Orioles once again took an early lead, using two homers in the first inning to get ahead. Steve Pearce hit his third homer in two days, and Nelson Cruz hit his first in a few days to give the Orioles a 2-0 lead. However a single and two doubles in the second inning tied the game for Texas. But those would be the only runs that McFarland would give up on the night. And for the record, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had the lead back in the last of the inning when Caleb Joseph smacked a two-run home run.Perhaps \xe2\x80\x9cthe key moment\xe2\x80\x9d of the game occurred in the last of the fourth with one out and the bases loaded. The one benefit for the defense with the bases loaded is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a force out at every base. Caleb Joseph hit what should have been a double-play ball to Elvis Andrus at short. Andrus bobbled the ball, and Texas was unable to record even one out \xe2\x80\x93 and J.J. Hardy scored from third. The Orioles would tack on three more runs on Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x98 two-RBI double and Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had an 8-2 lead.For once it seems, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had an opponent make a mistake in a game and they were held accountable for it. The Orioles have often seemed to have someone open the door for them in games only to let them off the hook by grounding into a double-play, or flying out. Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 two-run double and the sac fly by Pearce were also good signs. The O\xe2\x80\x99s have been scoring runs exclusively on homers for a few games, so it was nice to see some manufactured runs last night as well.Texas would put one more across in the sixth on an RBI-groundout, however with the 8-3 win last night you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard pressed to argue that the Birds haven\xe2\x80\x99t dominated in the first two games of this series with Texas. McFarland really did a huge service to Buck Showalter and the Birds last night by bridging the gap in the rotation that was created with Bud Norris\xe2\x80\x98 injury. The Birds did blow through four other relievers (after McFarland) last night, however they each pitched one inning. Showalter threw Zach Britton in for the ninth just because he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t worked since Friday night.The Orioles will look to Chris Tillman tonight to continue the trend of beating Texas. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Miles Mikolas who will be making his first start of the season for Texas. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be greeted by some Oriole bats that will come in pretty hot. The Orioles now sit one game behind Toronto for first place in the AL East, and they\xe2\x80\x99re 2.5 games ahead of NY, who\xe2\x80\x99s in third place.

He was happy to talk. Sturtze pitched for 12 seasons in the majors, with seven teams, but people ask him more about Jeter than any other teammate.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how it should be,\xe2\x80\x9d Sturtze said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the best player I ever played with.\xe2\x80\x9dIt was 10 years ago Tuesday that Jeter made his celebrated dive into the stands down the left field line, stealing a go-ahead hit from Trot Nixon to preserve a tie in the 12th inning. Jeter emerged from the stands bloodied and bigger than life.\xe2\x80\x9cI met him on the dirt of the infield, and I kind of gave him a little slap, like, \xe2\x80\x98Great catch!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Sturtze, who threw the pitch. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he looked at me, like, \xe2\x80\x98What are you, an idiot? I\xe2\x80\x99m sore!\xe2\x80\x99 I was just so fired up about the catch.\xe2\x80\x9dThe play, of course, became a cornerstone of the Jeter legend, and it stands now as the last moment of the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 cosmic stranglehold over the Boston Red Sox.

The Baltimore Orioles and the Toronto Blue Jays were nine under, and 16 and a half games from first.This was the second year of an 11-year stretch, through 2013, in which the A.L. East produced two playoff teams in every season except 2006. Now, the weakness of the division is the primary factor giving hope to all five teams.\xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about it for a couple of years \xe2\x80\x94 but only with better records,\xe2\x80\x9d Rays Manager Joe Maddon said. \xe2\x80\x9cLike everybody being .500 or better was the parity.

The Mariners made a dubious investment that the Yankees were wise to resist, signing Cano for 10 years and $240 million.

07/03/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Former Orioles finding success', 'Photo: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard to believe, but last season the Orioles began play on July 3rd with a 48-37 record. The 2014 Orioles currently have a 45-39 record. However, the major difference is the Orioles are presently a game back of the Toronto Blue Jays for the division lead, whereas last season they were 3.5 games back. Most of the core players from the 2013 roster are still on the 2014 roster. However, like every off-season for almost every team, the Orioles had several departures between last season and this season. This is especially true for the pitching staff.Around this time last season, the Orioles made a deal sending Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop to the Cubs for veteran starter Scott Feldman. Arrieta and Strop were both exceptionally talented but had fallen out of favor with Orioles management, as well as Orioles fans, after an extended period of inconsistency. They seemed to be classic \xe2\x80\x9cchange-of-scenery\xe2\x80\x9d players and Feldman seemed a good fit for a rotation seeking a stabilizing veteran. The Orioles got what they wanted from Feldman in the second half of last season. He was anything but exceptional, yet gave the Orioles quality innings pitching to a 4.27 ERA in his 15 starts for the Birds. However, the Orioles lost Feldman to free agency when he signed a lofty three year, 30 million dollar deal with the Astros. Feldman started off the season hot but has recently cooled off, and currently holds a 3.92 ERA in his 14 starts this season.Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop have both seemed to find a home in the National League. Arrieta made headlines earlier this week when he took a no-hitter into the eighth inning. He currently has an ERA of 1.81 in his 11 starts this season. He has also only walked 17 batters this season. In comparison, he walked 17 in 23 innings with the Orioles last season. Strop also seems to be more comfortable in Chicago. He has an ERA of 2.93 in 31 appearances this season. However, control still seems to be an issue as he has walked 15 in that span. An important member of the 2012 rotation that drove the Orioles into the post-season, Jason Hammel struggled with constancy and health in 2013, eventually losing his spot in the rotation. In the off-season, Hammel signed a one-year deal with the Cubs. Like Arrieta and Strop, Hammel has also found success in Chicago pitching to a 2.98 ERA over his 16 starts this season. He also averages nearly nine strike-outs per nine innings. The biggest surprise of the former Orioles would be Francisco Rodriguez. In 2013 with the Orioles, K-Rod hardly resembled the closer that once saved 62 games. In fact, he pitched to a very mediocre 4.50 ERA in his 23 appearances with the Orioles. However, this season he owns a 2.34 ERA in 42 appearances with the Brewers, and even leads all of baseball in saves with 27.Baseball is impossible to predict and there is no way of knowing what these players\xe2\x80\x99 numbers would look like if they were still in an Orioles uniform. However, the Orioles made a decision to allow these players to leave and are now hoping that the changes to their pitching staff translate to more success in 2014 than 2013.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have now played three of the five games during which third baseman Manny Machado will be serving his suspension time. This has the effect of opening the door for super-sub Ryan Flaherty to get some playing time.Though the Orioles used Chris Davis at third base on Monday night, Flaherty has gotten the call the past two evenings. He has gone 2-for-5 with two walks, scoring two runs and hitting the tie-breaking and ultimately game-winning RBI home run in the bottom of the seventh inning to power the Birds to their 6-4 win over the Texas Rangers.

After falling behind 4-0 in the third inning, Adam Jones began the comeback with a solo shot in the fourth. The Orioles clawed and scrounged their way to tie the game in the sixth frame, setting up Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s no-doubter bomb in the seventh.On various Orioles sites comment boards I often see Ryan Flaherty referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cFlaredog.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, this dog had its day with the home run, along with several very nice plays at third base.Flaherty is in my view a nice utility player to have around, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t now nor have I ever seen him as an everyday answer at any position. But he is a plus defender at any position and can give you some left-handed at-bats in the low .200s with some occasional power. He is going to have his dog\xe2\x80\x99s day once in a while, and it happened last night.The win kept the Orioles on pace with the Jays at a game behind \xe2\x80\x93 having the same number of losses, though two less wins. The Yankees are now 3.5 games behind the Orioles.This Texas Rangers team is clearly a fraction of what we are used to seeing with this franchise. Their starting pitching is really pretty rough and minimal, tough that changes tonight with Yu Davish taking the hill. Other than the 2012 playoff game, the Orioles have never faced him. He is currently 8-4 with a 2.42 ERA. He shut out the Twins over eight innings in his most recent start, though in his two prior outings he was touched for four runs by both the Angels and A\xe2\x80\x99s.Wei-Yin Chen will counter with his 7-3, 4.19 stats. His last outing against the Rays was not a good one at all, lasting only 3.1 innings. Of late, Chen has begun to leave too many pitches too high, and he has been paying for it.Though Chen has not pitched against the Rangers this year, his three previous starts have all been very good. In each he was the winning pitcher \xe2\x80\x93 giving up one run in each game for an ERA of 1.29.Against Chen, Elvis Andrus is 3-for-8 with a double, while Adrian Beltre has only a single in nine at-bats.The Rangers have lost eight consecutive games on the road and are now 10 games under .500.Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles lineup \xe2\x80\xa6 hoping the rain does not make it a late one \xe2\x80\xa6Nick Markakis RFSteve Pearce LFAdam Jones CFNelson Cruz DHChris Davis 1BJ.J.

The Tides had just nine hits on the day but benefited from eight walks. They had five hits and three walks in their six-run fourth inning.    Mike Wright was terrible again. This time he fell apart in the sixth inning, giving up four runs on six hits. Altogether he lasted 5 2/3 innings with six runs allowed via 11 hits. His ERA is now 6.47. Bowie Baysox 1, Altoona Curve 5 The Baysox had 10 hits, but could only manage one run on an RBI single by David Adams. DH Kyeong Kang was 3-for-5 with a double. 3B Niuman Romero added two hits. CF Dariel Alvarez went hitless and C Michael Ohlman and 1B Christian Walker had the night off. Matt Bischoff started and gave up four runs in 2 2/3 innings. Mychal Givens pitched two scoreless innings.    Frederick Keys 2, Salem Red Sox 6 It was not a good night for starting pitcher Parker Bridwell. He gave up four runs in the first inning and six runs overall, and was knocked out after just four innings pitched. Eight hits and three walks in four innings will do that. He did strike out six, at least.    The Keys had just four hits and three walks in the game. RF Brenden Webb had the only extra base hit, a double. LF Mike Yastrzemski, 1B Trey Mancini, and SS Adrian Marin were all hitless, although Yas picked up a walk. Delmarva Shorebirds 4, Kannapolis Intimidators 6 All eight hits and the lone walk picked up by the Shorebirds were confined to the 4-7 hitters as the Shorebirds needed a three-run rally in the ninth inning just to make the game close. 1B Creede Simpson was 2-for-4 with a double, DH Chance Sisco was 1-for-4, LF Conor Bierfeldt was 3-for-4 with two doubles, and C Austin Wynns was 2-for-4 with a walk.    Steven Brault started the game and probably hopes to forget it. He gave up six runs in just 4 1/3 innings, thanks in part to two home runs allowed. The good news for Brault is that he struck out eight and didn't walk any. That's not bad at all. Aberdeen Ironbirds 5, Staten Island Yankees 9 The Ironbirds were looking good with a 5-1 lead after five innings, but a six-run sixth by Staten Island wiped it all away. Pitcher Stephen Tarpley took the loss after giving up five runs on two walks and three hits in 2 1/3 inning. His relief, Stefan Crichtan, allowed two of Tarpley's runs and one of his own to score. Kevin Gausman started for the Ironbirds and pitched two innings with one single and one walk allowed. I don't want to talk any more about that because it'll make me mad.    CF Jay Gonzalez had a big night, picking up four hits. RF Oswill Lartiguez and 3B Frederico Castagnini also had two hits each. Most importantly, there is a player on the Ironbirds named Nigel Nootbaar. He pitched a scoreless inning with two strikeouts.

""That was one of the more impressive things I\'ve seen, to be able to bring that intensity into a game like that. The whole group, I was real proud of them tonight.""The game was delayed 1 hour and 38 minutes because of rain in the bottom of the eighth inning.Jones hit his 16th home run of the season and had three RBIs.

The Rangers have lost 13 of their past 16 games.""It was a lot of fun being out there,"" Mikolas said. ""I thought I pitched a pretty good game up until the fifth. Then, I had some trouble with some walks. Things kind of didn\'t go our way after that.""Staked to a 4-1 lead, Mikolas walked Nick Markakis and Steve Pearce with one out in the sixth. Jason Frasor entered and allowed a sacrifice fly to Jones and an RBI single to Nelson Cruz. He then walked Chris Davis before allowing a game-tying RBI single to J.J.

', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Orioles wake up against Texas bullpen after early Tillman ...', "" When the Orioles face a pitcher making his major league debut, as they did on Wednesday night against the Miles Mikolas of the Rangers, they seem to do poorly. That's probably because we only remember the failure, but still. They looked like they were going to be getting dominated early, at least until Orioles Magic happened and they eventually went on to a rain-delayed, but not denied, 6-4 victory.    For five innings, it was not an impressive performance against Mikolas. He only allowed three hits, one of which was a home run by Adam Jones, putting the Orioles on the board in the fourth inning. They trailed 4-1 because Chris Tillman was not good. Other than that Jones home run, neither was the Orioles offense, at least not until the sixth inning. Sometimes, all you have to do is stand there and let a guy walk you. That's what Nick Markakis and Steve Pearce did with one out in the sixth. Rangers manager Ron Washington had seen enough, pulling Mikolas with only 77 pitches thrown to tap reliever Jason Frasor from his bullpen. The Rangers bullpen has spent this season at the corner of Suck and Failure, so that's something of a bold strategy on Washington's part. Maybe we would have had to do a lot of cocaine to understand. Actually, it's possible the rookie was losing it and that was time to get him out of there, but Frasor, it turned out, was not the right guy to come in tonight.    Frasor uncorked a wild pitch, which moved up both runners into scoring position, then allowed Jones to hit a run-scoring sacrifice fly. Nelson Cruz singled to score Pearce from third, moved up to second on a Chris Davis walk, then scored when J.J. Hardy singled. Just like that, the Orioles had tied the game. Frasor gave up two hits and a walk in only two-thirds of an inning. He was charged with only one run, but he also allowed two inherited runners to score.    The next man out of the Texas bullpen was Neil Cotts, a lefty. It's a good idea to put in a lefty when two of the next three batters are lefties. That's the theory, anyway, but in practice, Cotts went 3-1 to the first batter, Ryan Flaherty, then left a meatball out over the plate. What does Flaherty do with meatballs? He, uh... he eats them. That metaphor sounded better in my head. What I mean to say is Flaherty hit his fourth home run of the season, a pretty shot that flew out onto the flag court, giving the Orioles a 5-4 lead in a game they looked like they had no chance of winning early. Only 16 more to go to live up to Hardy's pre-season prediction for Flaherty. The next time that Flaherty came up to bat, Texas intentionally walked him. What?    Later in the seventh, Jones got his third RBI of the night when he singled to drive in Pearce, who'd reached on his second walk of the night. He scored both times. Imagine that. All of the runs were needed to paper over a shaky outing from Tillman. Many of his struggles have come in the first two innings of his starts. Going into tonight, 30 of the 46 earned runs he had allowed came in the first and second innings. Tonight it was more of the same from Tillman, who got himself into trouble from the game's first batter. Three first inning singles led to a run. Tillman sent the 7-8-9 batters down in order in the second inning, then got himself in trouble again to start the third by walking Shin-Soo Choo. A fluke play put another runner on base. A hit and run play saw Choo put in motion, and Tillman threw a pitch so bad that Elvis Andrus had to take an ugly emergency hack to foul it off and protect his runner.    Orioles catcher Caleb Joseph pounced to prevent a wild pitch and possibly throw out the runner, but Andrus' downward cut caught Joseph's glove. This was ruled catcher's interference, which is the letter, if not the spirit, of the law. Manager Buck Showalter came out in vain for a lengthy protest. In a perfect world, once your Opening Day starter gets two men on base, one by a fluke, he would bear down and limit the damage. We live in the world where that starter was Tillman. Adrian Beltre touched him up for a two-run double and scored two batters later on an infield single from Leonys Martin. He'd put the Orioles in a 4-0 hole, though only three runs were earned. Martin contributed both at the plate and in the field for Texas on Wednesday. On top of his two hits and RBI, he also robbed a sure home run by Nelson Cruz in the second inning. Cruz hit a fly ball to deep center. It hung for a long time, giving Martin time to dash to the fence, climb it, and grab the ball before it could land in the O's bullpen. He made it look easy. On the night, Tillman went 5.2 innings, giving up the earned runs on seven hits and four walks against two strikeouts. Most nights, that's not going to be good enough. He left the game with the bases loaded in the top of the sixth. Brad Brach retired Carlos Pena on a groundout to first to limit the damage, which proved to be crucial. Brach pitched a scoreless seventh, striking out two. Darren O'Day added a perfect eighth. There was a rain delay of an hour and 36 minutes in the bottom of the eighth. Rain delays are the worst. It didn't hurt the O's any tonight, though. Zach Britton pitched a drama-free ninth to end it after the long delay, recording his 11th save of the year in 13 chances.    The Orioles have now won three straight against the faltering Rangers. These are the games you want to win, especially with the Blue Jays winning earlier on Wednesday. The O's keep pace at a game back in the division. Thursday's series finale will have Texas starting Yu Darvish, so, you know. Don't expect a four-game winning streak, which you shouldn't have done regardless of who's starting because these are the Orioles. Wei-Yin Chen starts the 7:05 game for the O's.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsBefore series between the Red Sox and Orioles, my colleague Pete Sonski at our FanSided site for the Red Sox \xe2\x80\x93 BoSox Injection \xe2\x80\x93 asks me to write up a little something as a preview. For a different touch than our previous Q&A thing, my creative friend suggested the following prompt for me:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve just received a phone call from Dan Duquette naming you interim manager for the 2nd half of the 2014 season. What are you going to do to lead the O\xe2\x80\x99s to the AL East Division Championship?\xe2\x80\x9d hey\xe2\x80\x93with my last name, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been called \xe2\x80\x9cBuck\xe2\x80\x9d beforeSo here is my answer that I sent to him that he has included on that site today:A first impulse is to just answer simply by saying \xe2\x80\x9cmore of the same.\xe2\x80\x9d It is difficult to be too terribly critical of Buck Showalter. Unlike the revolving door of his predecessors, I think Buck is indeed a great baseball guy who is very sharp and difficult to criticize much. Where the Orioles have not played well enough to gain more victories, it is not because Showalter did not pull the right levers. It is because players you would expect to be performing at a higher level were simply not getting it done (like Chris Davis batting .210 and $50 million-Ubaldo Jimenez with a 3-8 record).So there are only a few somewhat different moves I will be making now that I am in charge.Young Kevin Gausman will become a regular part of the rotation until such time as he proves he is not at all ready and capable \xe2\x80\xa6 but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is going to happen. The Orioles have had him up and down and up and down all season between AAA Norfolk and Baltimore. He has pitched several very fine games, and he is by talent the best arm on the team \xe2\x80\x93 throwing into the upper 90s deep into a game. So it is time to fully unwrap the present, take it out of its box, plug it in and see what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got. We will start this on Sunday in Boston.Starting pitching has been up and down for the Baltimore Orioles. It was presumed to be the Achilles Heel (or should I say the \xe2\x80\x9cAchilles Arm?\xe2\x80\x9d) for the O\xe2\x80\x99s this season, while the hitting was expected to be awesome. Honestly, though far from a group of aces, the pitching has done reasonably well on most occasions, while the offense has been the cause of more losses. Even so, the bats have come alive of late, as the Orioles led all of baseball with 46 home runs in the month of June.All of this is to say that, if I am going to promote Gausman to a regular turn in the rotation, someone has to be pulled out. That someone is going to be Miguel Gonzalez, who has really struggled since coming off the DL a few weeks ago from a groin injury (the ailment of the year for Orioles players). Over the past two years, Gonzalez has performed well and been a sweet deal for the amount of dollars being paid. But he does not have overpowering stuff, and he therefore needs to pitch on the edge all of the time. He has little margin for error; and when he tires in the fifth or sixth inning, he can go over the cliff quickly. I see him as a long reliever, though I will still have to start him one last time in Boston.That will leave my Orioles with a rotation of Chris Tillman, Ubaldo Jimenez, Wei-Yin Chen, Bud Norris (coming back from, what else? \xe2\x80\xa6 yes, a groin injury), and Kevin Gausman.It is going to be pretty much impossible to replace Buck in the clubhouse and in the hearts of the players, but, if they want to call me \xe2\x80\x9cBuck\xe2\x80\x9d it will be fine. With a last name pronounced \xe2\x80\x9cBuck-man,\xe2\x80\x9d it is not as if that has never happened before. However, I may prove to be a little bit less loyal than the former Buck.Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty on some occasions is a bit over the top, as he will stick with a player in a designated role or position in the batting order longer than is maybe deserved. His belief is that historic performance will, given some patience, generally return to a similar level. While this may be true more often than not, until it happens, Chris Davis may be batting lower in the lineup than fourth or fifth. For example, he just broke an 0-for-21 streak and is batting about .150 over the past month. And Manny Machado will have to come back from this five-game suspension and continue to prove that he has earned the #2 position in the batting order once again. His first game will be Saturday, but he was hitting the ball hard before this inconvenience came along.

This is a personal opinion more than an Orioles criticism, because, in fact, we may have one of the best situations in MLB for a \xe2\x80\x9ccloser\xe2\x80\x9d in Zach Britton. Since I was not named to this position until now, and if I had been in a decision-influencing role over the winter of 2012-13, I would have screamed loudly that I wanted Koji Uehara to be secured for the back of bullpen \xe2\x80\xa6 I wrote about it extensively at the time, but he ended up on this other team somewhere else! All to say \xe2\x80\x93 if the meat of the opponent\xe2\x80\x99s order comes to bat in the eighth inning and we are holding on to a one-run lead, Britton will be on the mound throwing his deadly sinkers then, and not being saved for the ninth.So, I thank my friend Pete Sonski for the wonderful opportunity to take the Baltimore Orioles to the AL East championship.Sincerely,\xe2\x80\x9cBuck\xe2\x80\x9d Buchman ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: David Manning-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have had a number of recent transactions about which we may catch up with some thoughts and comments \xe2\x80\xa6 doing so while game two of the Saturday doubleheader has begun. The first game was a 3-2 loss to the Red Sox with a walk-off blooper after an infield single and sacrifice \xe2\x80\xa6 geez! Of course, if the Orioles could score more than two unearned runs in nine innings, the situation would not have been present. Good pitching stops good hitting again\xe2\x80\xa6 more on all of this later.A big roster move of course is the return of Manny Machado in game two after his five-game suspension has now been served. The big concern was how the Orioles were going to manage being without him and playing with a 24-man roster. They were 4-1. So much for that big worry. But he is now back, and it will be interesting to see if he can continue with the hot hitting displayed in the series of games just prior to the suspension. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope so, as it would make a huge difference in the lineup. The need for the Orioles is not just to have Manny back from the suspension, but to also have him back to Manny 2013 form.More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryA pending resolution to the Nolan Reimold saga should be realized by the 10th at the latest. He has been designated for assignment after apparent attempts to find a trade partner failed. Any team who claims Reimold off waivers will be responsible for roughly one-half of his $1.025-million salary.Conventional wisdom has always been that Reimold would never pass through waivers \xe2\x80\x93 that he is good enough that someone will claim the former second-rounder and top 100 prospect. But perhaps the salary and injury history will be just enough to squeeze him through successfully? I do hope so. Readers of this blog will not remember my long history of being a Reimold advocate, even in the face of his sad health history. He would appear now to finally and truly be beyond the issues \xe2\x80\xa6 and yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that before, I know. If he goes, I guarantee a day will come when the O\xe2\x80\x99s see him down the road and he spanks our boys and we regret seeing him elsewhere. However, having written all of that, and given the surprisingly awesome situation with Nelson Cruz, Steve Pearce, and Delmon Young this year, there really is no better or different path that Dan Duquette should have taken. Reimold is a good guy, and I hope he can yet be an Oriole player at some point.Also being DFA-ed was Michael Almanzar \xe2\x80\x93 the Rule 5 draftee who has gone back to Boston after his long injury rehab. It never made even the least bit of sense to me why the Baltimore Orioles would have an interest in this guy, even with the yet-to-be-fully-recovered Manny Machado at that time. My guess is that we will not likely hear of this fellow again, though, with all young guys with a dream, I wish him well.As I write this, the Ubaldo Jimenez walk machine is working its poison tonight, but at least the bullpen was not used up in game one.Being recalled to the Orioles also for game two is Preston Guilmet. In his previous stint this year with the Birds he pitched in nine games. He was not scored upon in six innings covering his first four appearances. But then he gave up six runs in the next 3.1 innings of work. His numbers at Norfolk this year feature 27 innings with a 4-1 record and 4.60 ERA; but a good note is that his WHIP is an excellent 1.09.After the end of this second game, the current 26-man roster will need to see a reduction of one player. The most obvious choice would be Ramon Ramirez, so I would look for him to be used a bit before the night is over. Beyond this, another move will need to be made to get Kevin Gausman on the roster for Sunday. So Guilmet may well be gone on the shuttle back to Norfolk, whereas Ramirez would be a DFA.It seems to Baltimore Orioles fans that the Birds are continuously making these moves at a level beyond other teams. I believe this is true to some extent, though less this year than in the last two seasons.As a final unrelated note, the Fox announcers were just talking about what a tiny team is the Red Sox, meaning they have so many small players. It is so true. I remember in the last series pulling up their roster online while looking at the game to check out this very issue.

""Under control a little bit more and just told myself, Try not to do too much and stay aggressive down in the zone,\' especially against a team like this that has a good lineup.""We came up a little short. T.J.\'s been throwing the ball really well. You can\'t do anything about that.""Boston\'s sixth walkoff victory of the season snapped a three-game losing streak.Pinch-hitter Jonny Gomes legged out a leadoff infield single off McFarland (1-2) before Ross bunted Gomes to second. Herrera then blooped a broken-bat base hit over second base to score Gomes.Koji Uehara (4-2) worked a perfect ninth and Stephen Drew hit his first home run since the World Series for Boston.The Orioles\' two runs came on Xander Bogaerts\' two-out error in the third inning of a game being made up after Friday\'s was rained out.Lester allowed two unearned runs and five hits in eight innings, striking out seven with no walks.Drew ripped Gonzalez\'s first-pitch fastball into the right field bleachers in the second inning, and Jackie Bradley Jr. later doubled and scored on first baseman Steve Pearce\'s error.The Orioles tied it in the third when third baseman Bogaerts booted Pearce\'s two-out grounder, allowing two runs to score. The inning began with Pedroia\'s poor throw to first, his first error since April 24.The Red Sox were without designated hitter David Ortiz, who was returning from his native Dominican Republic, where he attended his daughter\'s graduation.With third baseman Manny Machado serving the last of his five-game suspension for throwing a bat in a game against Oakland last month, the Orioles were in the odd position of having 24 players for the first game and 26 for Game 2. Reliever Preston Guilmet was called up as the extra player allowed for the second game.NOTES: Showalter said it was a ""short evaluation"" to hold RHP Ubaldo Jimenez for the nightcap once he saw Jimenez is 0-5 with a 10.55 ERA in five afternoon starts. He\'s 3-3 with a 2.53 ERA in 12 night starts. John Lackey (9-5) will start for Boston. . The Orioles planned to recall RHP Kevin Gausman from Triple-A Norfolk to start Sunday\'s series finale against Jake Peavy. . Boston manager John Farrell said OF Shane Victorino (hamstring, back) could begin another rehabilitation assignment in a few days. He had a long-toss in the outfield between games. . Baltimore RHP Bud Norris threw a two- to three-inning simulated game on the field between games. Norris is currently on the disabled list with a sore right groin, and Showalter said if Norris feels well after the session, he could be in line to start Wednesday against Washington. Baltimore traded its pregame batting practice for the right to use the field between games.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Encina, The Baltimore SunBOSTON \xe2\x80\x94 Rest assured, there were plenty of \xe2\x80\x9cDo Not Disturb\xe2\x80\x9d signs hanging from doors in the Orioles\' team hotel Friday.The early postponement of Friday afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game in Boston allowed the Orioles, who arrived here around 4 a.m., to go back to bed and get some much-needed sleep. And since the announcement of today\'s split-admission doubleheader was made three hours before game time, the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to come to Fenway Park \xe2\x80\x94 the team bus hadn\xe2\x80\x99t left for the ballpark yet.And, no, you\xe2\x80\x99re not dreaming: The Orioles are in first place in the American League East.The best news of the day for Orioles fans was that the club didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to play to take sole possession of first in the division. The Toronto Blue Jays lost to the Oakland Athletics, 1-0, on Nick Punto\xe2\x80\x99s walk-off double, meaning the Orioles open the day with a half-game lead over Toronto, which has lost four of its past six games and 16 of its past 25. var adSkipCounter = 0; So, for all that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone right this season \xe2\x80\x94 the season-ending injury to catcher Matt Wieters, the struggles of All-Stars Chris Davis and Manny Machado, a starting rotation that had its share of warts, and a once-uncertain closer situation \xe2\x80\x94 the Orioles are in first place.Believe it.Doubleheaders are difficult to sweep, but the Orioles have a chance to move two games ahead of Toronto with two wins today and another Blue Jays loss in Oakland.OK, we\'re getting ahead of ourselves.Orioles manager Buck Showalter hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been shy to talk about his frustration with the club\'s schedule. The last time the Orioles came to Boston, they played a ""Sunday Night Baseball"" game at 7 p.m., then had an 11 a.m. start the following day.But that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad as Thursday night, when the Orioles had to get on a team charter at 2 a.m. to fly into Boston.Because of the doubleheader, right-hander Miguel Gonzalez will receive an extra day of rest. In his career, Gonzalez is 5-3 with a 2.77 ERA in 13 career starts with five days\' rest. Gonzalez is also 1-0 with a 2.53 ERA in three games (one start) at Fenway Park, holding the Red Sox to a .238 batting average. He is 3-0 with a 3.13 ERA overall against the club.Although his career numbers at Fenway Park are impressive, Gonzalez has made just one start against the Red Sox in Boston, allowing two runs on seven hits over 6 1/3 innings on Sept. 21, 2012.Right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez, who will start Game 2, doesn\'t have as promising a precedent. He is 1-3 with a 9.31 ERA in six career starts against the Red Sox. As a team, the Red Sox are hitting .309 against Jimenez.Jimenez doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fare any better against the Red Sox at Fenway Park, where he is 0-1 with a 9.31 ERA in two starts over 9 2/3 innings. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t get out of the sixth in either of those starts, including on April 20, when he allowed three runs on four hits, striking out five batters and walking three over 5 1/3 innings in a 6-5 loss.Keep in mind that that start was during Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s rocky first month as an Oriole. He\xe2\x80\x99s allowed two or fewer runs in three of his past five starts.eencina@baltsun.comtwitter.com/EddieInTheYard     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldPriest at once defended, excoriated1969 slayings of 2 women forge police-FBI liaisonA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

The Orioles chased him in the big sixth inning on their way to pounding out a total of 16 hits on the evening.It was also a first game back for Manny Machado who hit the ball hard on two occasions for a 2-for-5 evening, while also making a Manny-like barehanded pickup.The win gives the Orioles a chance to win the series and take the lead in the season series which is currently tied at 6-6.On Sunday, the Orioles will be facing veteran Jake Peavy, who is currently just 1-7 with a 4.82 ERA in 17 starts. This will be the third game this season that Peavy has pitched against the Birds. He is 0-1, having given up nine runs in 12.2 innings. Over his career against Baltimore he is 2-1 with a 4.41 ERA in only five starts.Adam Jones has been a beast against Peavy with a 7-for-12, including a double and home run. Nick Markakis also has a homer among his five hits in 14 at-bats. Nelson Cruz is 4-for-13 with two doubles and a homer, while Delmon Young is 3-for-13 with a double and home run. On the other hand, Chris Davis is only 1-for-10 and J.J. Hardy 2-for-22.The Orioles will activate Kevin Gausman and start him for the sixth time this season. In 28 innings he is 3-2 with a 3.86 ERA. This is his first occasion to face the Red Sox this year. In one start and three relief appearances over 9.2 innings last year, Gausman was 1-0 with only two runs given up on a pair of solo home runs.It will be interesting to see if this time will be the final trip back to the Orioles for Gausman.

He did K 6, walk only 1, and induce 5 grounders to just 1 flyout. So there's that. Jemile Weeks and Steve Clevenger each had multi-hit nights, as each continue to press their case for promotion to the bigs.    Bowie 7 Akron (Cleveland) 1 Anthony Vasquez with a sturdy 7 innings performance. He allowed 6 hits and 1 run while striking out 7 and walking none. The Walker and Alvarez hit parade continued, as Christian Walker hit his 20th HR of the season while Alvarez reached base once via hit and once via walk. Haven't checked in with John Ruettiger or Garabez Rosa recently. Each went 3 for 4 with a double. Rosa added his 7th HR of the season. Frederick 17 Lynchburg (Atlanta) 3 The performance of the night certainly belonged to Mike Yastrzemski, who went 5 for 6 with 5 RBI en route to hitting for the Cycle. He singled to lead off the game, doubled in the 2nd to drive in 2, homered in the 5th, doubled again in the 7th, and then led of the 9th with a triple. After hitting .306 / .365 / .554 in Low-A Delmarva, lil' Yaz hasn't missed a beat with High-A Frederick, slashing .321 / .379 / .482 over his first 15 games. Keep in mind that he was a 14th round selection, and will turn 24 in August. That being said, I'm certainly interested in reading some actual scouting takes on him. Can he keep this type of performance up and turn into a legitimate prospect? He certainly has to be garnering some attention by now. Yaz's big night overshadowed Michael Burgess' 2 HR game, giving him 15 (4th most in the entire Orioles organization) on the season. Burgess finished 4 for 6 with 4 RBI. Adrian Marin also had a big night, going 3 for 4 with 2 doubles, 2 walks, and a SB. With all that run support Branden Kline cruised through 5+ innings, allowing 3 ER while striking out 5. A nice little bounceback performance for him after having allowed 13 ER over his last 3 outings, covering 14.1 IP.    Lakewood (Phillies) 3 Delmarva 6 Hunter Harvey Day was another rousing success, as he K'd 8 over 6 strong innings of work. He has now faced Lakewood three times and earned 3 Wins. 19 IPs, 8 Hits, 3 Runs (1 Earned), 6 BBs, 25 Ks, combined. I'd imagine they are as eager as anyone to see him promoted.

That came to a head in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game when Cruz went 5-for-5 at the plate, and barely missed hitting for the cycle. Cruz doubled in the eighth inning, and knowing that he needed a triple to complete the cycle (on a night when Mike\xc2\xa0Yastrzemski did just that in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 minor league system) tried to stretch it into a triple. Cruz was thrown out at third base by a hair \xe2\x80\x93 and the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout loved it. Even Buck Showalter cracked a smile; that\xe2\x80\x99s how loose a clubhouse can be in a winning effort.One start after turning in his best outing as an Oriole, Ubaldo Jimenez returned to his old struggles. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 3.2 IP, 5 H, 4 R, 6 BB, 4 K. Those six walks and four strikeouts will add to your pitch total, however I suspect that Jimenez was removed when he was due to ineffectiveness. Buck Showalter said that he thought Jimenez was \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively wild,\xe2\x80\x9d which probably helped him to garner those four K\xe2\x80\x99s. After the game Jimenez said he felt it was a mechanical issue, which means that it\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s fixable. What \xe2\x80\x9cfixable\xe2\x80\x9d entails is another story that we can debate at another time. Having said that, for those of you who say\xc2\xa0just DFA him, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine and dandy if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to have the Orioles pay him to play elsewhere for the next three plus years.The Baltimore Orioles struck first in this game, which ended up being somewhat of a back-and-forth affair. Manny Machado singled to center in the top of the fourth, and Nick Hundley followed that up with a homer to give the Birds a 2-0 lead. However as they\xe2\x80\x99re so good at doing, Boston provided a big inning in their home yard. Mike Napoli drew a walk off of Jimenez to lead off the last of the fourth, which was followed by a Stephen Drew homer which tied the score at two. Nothing good happens after a walk, remember? Brock Holt would add an RBI-double later in the inning, and Daniel Nava an RBI-single, and suddenly Boston had chased Jimenez and held a 4-2 lead.Courtesy of Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY SportsIdeally a team has done it\xe2\x80\x99s job at the plate when they chase a starter after 3.2 innings. However as strong as the Oriole bullpen is, that\xe2\x80\x99s not always the case against the Baltimore Orioles. Boston couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have known that the Oriole \xe2\x80\x98pen would pitch 5.1 innings of scoreless baseball \xe2\x80\x93 but that\xe2\x80\x99s what they did. And while they did that Oriole bats started heating up again, and as per usual it started with the longball. I mentioned above that Nelson Cruz almost hit for the cycle \xe2\x80\x93 his solo homer in the fifth brought the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within 4-3.Having said that, what shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go lost is the heads-up defense that we saw from Jonathan Schoop in the last of the inning. After David Ortiz led off with a double, he made a fatal base running mistake by trying to take third on a grounder hit to his left. I think that many second basemen might be so shocked to see the runner going in that situation, that they might hesitate for a moment and the runner would end up being safe at third (kind of similar to a pitcher being effectively wild). However Schoop threw Ortiz out at third base, which bought the Orioles a key out.Following a Schoop single and a Nick Markakis walk in the sixth, Steve Pearce burned an Oriole opponent for the upteenth time this week and sent an RBI-single up the middle tying the game at four. Markakis would later take third on Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 single, and he would score on an error by Daniel Nava. Pearce would later score on an infield RBI-single by Nelson Cruz, and Jones on a bases loaded fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice-RBI by J.J. Hardy.When the smoke cleared, the O\xe2\x80\x99s held a 7-4 lead. As I said above, when you have a bullpen as strong as that of the Orioles, you relax when you have a lead like that. However one can rarely relax in a park like Fenway, that is until the final out is recorded. Zach Britton pitched a clean ninth inning, earning the O\xe2\x80\x99s a hard-fought 7-4 lead and a split in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s doubleheader.That sets up a rubber match this afternoon at \xe2\x80\x9cthe Fens,\xe2\x80\x9d with Kevin Gausman on the bump. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will need to make a roster move to bring Gausman up, and I suspect that a reliever will be optioned to make room. The Orioles optioned Preston Guilmet back to triple-A Norfolk following last night\xe2\x80\x99s game; Guilmet had been called up as the 26th man on the roster as is allowed by MLB rules in doubleheaders. Gausman will be opposed by Jake Peavy this afternoon.Bud Norris is expected to start either Tuesday at Washington or Wednesday against Washington at Camden Yards. (My advice would be to start him on Tuesday given that he\xe2\x80\x99s pitched in the NL and probably has more plate appearances than any other Oriole pitcher\xe2\x80\xa6!) So another roster move will have to be made to bring Norris off the DL \xe2\x80\x93 one has to hope that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t Gausman who\xe2\x80\x99s sent back down again, but time will tell. My prediction is that it ends up being a reliever, and with the all-star break forthcoming the O\xe2\x80\x99s will have a chance to re-shuffle their rotation a bit. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles left fielder David Lough was put into the game on Sunday against the Red Sox at Fenway as a defensive replacement. The Orioles had just scored four runs in the top of the seventh inning to take a 6-1 lead and it made sense to replace starter Delmon Young with the best fielder on the bench.The old adage is that you can never score enough runs at Fenway Park, and that proved to be true again as Boston plated five runners in the bottom of the seventh to tie the score at 6-6.The Baltimore bullpen, which has so often been so good of late, had a meltdown in the seventh inning. It was so bad that even David Ortiz got a hit off Brian Matusz! Yes, weird.Between the two teams in the seventh inning, a total of 18 batters would come to the plate, and 13 hits would be registered.But just as quickly as the bullpen broke down, it locked down from that point forward. Tommy Hunter had a scoreless eighth, while Brad Brach gave the Birds three scoreless innings to eventually get the win. And Zach Britton recorded the save in the 12th to join in keeping the Red Sox off the board.But the difference-making hit came from the defensive replacement David Lough who led off the top of the 12th with a long triple to center field. He would score on a single through the drawn-in infield off the bat of J.J. Hardy.But Lough\xe2\x80\x99s excellent inning was not yet over. After Britton struck out Dustin Pedroia to begin the bottom of the 12th, Big Papi drilled a ball off the Green Monster in left. Lough played the bounce off the wall perfectly and fired to second base to nail Ortiz going for a double. You live by the wall; you die by the wall. It was a big out of a big man \xe2\x80\x93 about the only big guy on the diminutive footie-sox team \xe2\x80\x93 and the truth is that the Sox are indeed bigger than an average little league squad, no matter how much it does not look that way.Zach Britton finished the game with a deserving strikeout of the annoying Mike Napoli, who is now officially the only player who looks back at umpires more than Derek Jeter. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t swing at that, therefore it is a ball; what is wrong with you?\xe2\x80\x9dIt was a good thing indeed that Britton did not allow the game to continue further. \xc2\xa0Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day was not really available and was the only person remaining in the bullpen. At the beginning of extra innings, I jokingly sent this tweet:No pitching problems here for the #Orioles\xe2\x80\xa6 Chris Davis is available.\xe2\x80\x94 Randy Buchman (@osayorioles) July 6, 2014Apparently Buck Showalter was thinking the same thing, as he said after the game, \xe2\x80\x9cI was talking to Chris Davis, I said \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re next.\xe2\x80\x99 He was ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Showalter said later in the press conference, in reflecting on the Sunday (5/6/12) 17-inning game at Boston, \xe2\x80\x9cI had some deja vu going because Chris was in the dugout that game.

Each threw seven good innings, and each gave up a two-run homer \xe2\x80\x93 Strasburg to Nelson Cruz in the fourth inning, and Tillman to Anthony Rendon in the sixth.The Nats had a chance to win the game in the bottom of the ninth inning as Ryan Zimmerman hit a one-out double, but Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day pitched his way out of it with strikeouts of Ian Desmond and Wilson Ramos \xe2\x80\x93 sending the game to extra innings.

And then the struggling Chris Davis came to bat \xe2\x80\xa6 yes, the first baseman who sat the bench yesterday, was 0-for-4 today, and whose average had fallen below .200 during the game.

Though Norris has been mostly solid the whole year, it is always scary to see a first start coming back from an injury.Norris is 2-0 in three starts against the Nationals, giving up eight runs on 21 hits over 19.2 innings.

Machado doubled with one out in the top of the first, and Strasburg singled on a 3-2 pitch in the third.In the fourth, Machado led off with a single and Cruz drove a 1-0 pitch over the wall in right-center. Cruz has already topped his home run total of last year, when he hit 27 during a season cut short by a 50-game suspension as part of the Biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal.Strasburg struck out the next four batters before Tillman grounded out to end the fifth.The Nationals didn\'t get a runner past first base until the sixth, when Denard Span hit a leadoff single and Rendon followed with his 13th home run, the first since June 24.

This week, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go through the Orioles system level by level and highlight players of value who could have new homes by the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline if the Orioles want to make a move. \xc2\xa0Like the Orioles\' Triple-A affiliate in Norfolk, the Orioles Double-A affiliate in Bowie has a handful of valuable players amid a lineup of veteran minor leaguers and organizational filler. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to look farther than some of the team\xe2\x80\x99s Eastern League All-Star selections -- outfielder Dariel Alvarez, first baseman Christian Walker, and left-hander Tim Berry -- to get a good idea in which players other teams might be interested.As I\xe2\x80\x99ve written multiple times this year, Walker and Alvarez are two of the best hitters in the system. Both got off to scorching hot starts, with Walker sitting at .206/.366/.536 with 20 home runs and 76 RBIs, and Alvarez at .310/.333/.497 with 14 home runs, 20 doubles, and 67 RBIs for the Baysox. var adSkipCounter = 0; Alvarez has developed some buzz in the scouting community for his quick bat and ability to generate power, with one American League scout calling him one of the biggest sleepers in baseball. Walker has the ability to barrel up a baseball, and he has found the power stroke required of a first baseman.My personal preference list would place Alvarez over Walker, though either could be a secondary piece in a larger deal. I doubt either would fetch a ton on his own. But the fact that they are among the top three or four hitting prospects in the system, yet are no more than the second piece in a big deal, is a bigger indictment of the system itself than the players.There are several young, interesting pitchers, headlined by left-handers Berry and Eduardo Rodriguez. Berry is a projectable 23-year-old with a low-90s fastball, a curveball and a changeup who was added to the 40-man roster last fall. He\xe2\x80\x99s 4-5 with a 4.04 ERA, and he still has intriguing upside if a team is willing to wait on him to fully develop.Rodriguez can locate a low-90s fastball and 83-84 mph breaking ball, and he has a feel for a changeup, but none of the pitches grade out as above average. Last year, he was considered in the same category with Dylan Bundy and Kevin Gausman as a player unlikely to be traded, and he still probably is considering he\xe2\x80\x99s in his age 21 season in Double-A.But while Bundy and Gausman would likely be the centerpiece in a big, major league deal, Rodriguez probably finds himself right on the fringe of A- and B-level prospect entering this deadline.jmeoli@baltsun.comtwitter.com/jonmeoli     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldPriest at once defended, excoriated1969 slayings of 2 women forge police-FBI liaisonA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

07/09/2014,"[('The Orioles should trade for Ben Zobrist - Camden Chat', "" The Orioles are part of a very strange year of parity in MLB, a year where there aren't a lot of obvious buyers or sellers. \xc2\xa0The two most obvious clubs in each respective boat, the Athletics and Cubs, already made their huge, splashy trade last week, and after that there are only a handful of MLB clubs far enough above or below .500 to be obviously in either camp. \xc2\xa0After their sudden hot streak to claim the division lead, the Orioles just might be buyers. \xc2\xa0And one of the remaining obvious sellers, to the surprise of many, are the division rival Tampa Bay Rays. \xc2\xa0Tampa's two biggest trade chips are their ace starter, David Price, who would meet an Orioles team need but would be a very pricey rental, and the guy the Orioles should really think about targeting - Ben Zobrist.    When our own Camden Hu wrote last week about\xc2\xa0where the Orioles should target a trade, the obvious choices were second base, catcher and starting pitcher. \xc2\xa0Starting pitching is always an expensive thing to acquire at the trade deadline, and the Orioles are probably hoping to plug any rotation holes that arise from within, via Kevin Gausman and, in a month or two, Dylan Bundy. \xc2\xa0The trade market for catchers is uninspiring, and if the Orioles want to tinker with their catching platoon, they already have Steve Clevenger in AAA, who can probably upgrade the left-handed side of a platoon if Nick Hundley doesn't show any improvement. \xc2\xa0That leaves second base, and Ben Zobrist is the best second baseman on the trading block right now. I won't lie; I have a bit of a man-crush on Ben Zobrist. \xc2\xa0On a bunch of Rays teams that have been good and horrible, likeable and hatable alike, Zobrist has been a quiet, productive cog, willing to play anywhere on the diamond, play adequate defense and put in above-average at-bats while doing so. \xc2\xa0His slugging has declined in recent years, while his contact and on-base skills have remained a valuable asset for any team. \xc2\xa0He's earning $7M this year, and has a $7.5M team option (with a $500k buyout) for next year, a bargain using the standard $/WAR metric, considering that Zobrist has been a consistent 4-5 WAR player even outside of his monster peak in 2011. Although the Orioles could primarily plug Zobrist in at second base, he has the ability to spell J.J. Hardy at shortstop as well, which adds value given that currently only Ryan Flaherty can do so off the bench. \xc2\xa0The Orioles would have their choice of optioning either Flaherty or Jonathan Schoop if they added Zobrist, if they wanted to keep Schoop on the roster even as a reserve -- whereas most other second base acquisitions would basically require the club to stash Schoop at AAA.    Lastly, Zobrist would just plain make the Orioles better. \xc2\xa0The Orioles have earned a combined 0.2 WAR from their second basemen to date, and they're not projected to do much better the rest of the way (0.5 WAR projected, good for 27th in MLB if that holds up). \xc2\xa0Zobrist, with his career .263/.353/.433 line and sturdy swiss-army-knife defense, would be good for more than that pretty much no matter what the second half held for him. There is, of course, the small question of what it would take to land Zobrist. \xc2\xa0The Rays have stated a willingness to trade in the division for the right price, and Zobrist fits the Orioles' needs, but the Orioles have to open the bidding with a clear statement that Gausman, Bundy and Hunter Harvey are off the table, even with Zobrist being more than a half-year rental player. \xc2\xa0But in my mind, a package involving hot pitching commodity Eduardo Rodriguez with a couple other prospects shouldn't be off the table at all, if the Rays will come around on such an offer. \xc2\xa0I'd love to see Zobrist in orange -- he'd look awfully good in the two-hole of the Orioles lineup the rest of the way, and be a great commodity in 2015 as the Orioles have to contend with the possible loss of J.J.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe same storm or storms that postponed the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals game to Monday, August 4th came through my home area previously, knocking out power and internet connections \xe2\x80\xa6 I think so. I say \xe2\x80\x9cthink so\xe2\x80\x9d because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know any details at all. I\xe2\x80\x99m cut off from the world with no power or connections. I can see that the internet provider is not operating. I simply heard a one-sentence announcement on the car radio that the game has been postponed.So, this is a challenge to write an article on battery power and candlelight. Late at night here on Tuesday evening, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the teams are planning to do about pitching assignments for Wednesday \xe2\x80\x93 if they will continue with the original plan just pushed back a day or what?I thought it might be interesting to look back to this week just two years ago and see what I was writing about the Orioles at the beginning of July. And it is really encouraging to review and see how far the Baltimore Orioles have indeed progressed from that time.More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryI wrote an article in the first week of July 2012 about what the Orioles needed to address for the second half of the season to be a success. And it certainly was! For the first half of the season the Birds were 44-37, but they then put up a record of 49-32 for the second half.The text that I include here in italics is excerpted from that article of just two years ago this week\xe2\x80\xa6To repeat an already worn-out theme: this is better than practically anyone would have expected in, say, March. Though everyone would acknowledge some good things have happened for the Orioles this year, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think most Birds fans have a confident sense of expectation for the rest of the year. Much of that is the \xe2\x80\x9c14-year history,\xe2\x80\x9d though more of it has to do with inconsistency of performance, the common RISP problems, and glaring defensive errors.If you recall from the spring of 2012, there were few people expecting the Orioles to contend. Most would have been thrilled with a simple .500 season. The O\xe2\x80\x99s had a great start in April, but then did not do as well in the second quarter of the year; and you can see from what I wrote that there was a lot of worry and lack of confidence that even the good first half of the year could be repeated. Inconsistent play and problems with RISP sometimes still continue to be an issue, but we may forget what incredible strides have been made defensively in the past two years. Not only was it successfully addressed for the second half of 2012, it became the foundation for setting all-time records in 2013. Who would have seen that happening just two years ago today?Right now, the Orioles have only about one-half of a regular line-up of high performers in the field and at the plate. Think about it!\xc2\xa0 That statement may have even been generous. There is Adam Jones in center and Matt Wieters at catcher. Sometimes J.J. Hardy, Chris Davis, and Wilson Betemit rise to high performance standards, and Nick Markakis is on the road back. But that\xe2\x80\x99s it \xe2\x80\xa6 everyone else is a fill-in at this point. The Orioles need to particularly have the latter four names pick it up and carry this team.At this point, the Orioles are only \xe2\x80\x9cfilling in\xe2\x80\x9d at catcher and second base. The catcher situation has been at least adequate and only exists because of the season-ending injury to Wieters. And Jonathan Schoop is growing and learning on the job; and it would not be a big surprise to see him suddenly turn the corner into a high level of performance.In 2012 I especially \xe2\x80\x9cwent off\xe2\x80\x9d on the issue of third base \xe2\x80\xa6This is a huge problem. There really is not a visible solution. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to evaluate any trade possibilities for such, as it seems too far into the speculative to comment upon. But the internal options are all rather poor defensively. This is becoming a top priority for the offseason.Of course this was still a few weeks before Manny Machado was moved to third in the minors for a few games, and then brought to the Orioles where the whole defense made a dramatic shift.I was also fretting about left field in 2012 \xe2\x80\xa6With Nolan Reimold out of the equation, insert Avery. He has the tools, will be a best choice on defense, and can maybe grow over the next 81 games to become a regular player in the major leagues. Now the Orioles have Nelson Cruz, Delmon Young, Steve Pearce and David Lough as options. That is quite a difference.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireAnd not only that, first base was even a concern at this point just two years ago \xe2\x80\xa6There are a number of choices (hopefully which do not include Nick Johnson). Actually, Mark Reynolds is the best defensively (I\xe2\x80\x99ll pause for a moment while the words \xe2\x80\x9cMark Reynolds\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbest defensively\xe2\x80\x9d sink in as having been used in the same sentence without a negative).\xc2\xa0 Chris Davis should be put here and worked with and worked with to make it a positive situation. He has looked so horrible at digging any throws out of the dirt, etc\xe2\x80\xa6 but the guy has the ability and his bat needs to stay in the lineup most days. He could be a star player if he can learn consistency at the plate. He\xe2\x80\x99ll probably always be a streaky hitter, but few people can spank a ball as he does. He has to play until he proves like Mark Reynolds has (imho) that, nice guy aside, he needs to take a train somewhere else.Yes, I was one of those who did not grieve the loss of Mark Reynolds, though he did play better after this article was written, especially defensively at first base. But look at how far Crush was from being considered an every-day player at that time.The leadoff position was unclear in the middle of 2012 with Brian Roberts injured yet again, and I am pleased to see how wise I actually was on this subject, even if I was pretty wrong on a couple of others \xe2\x80\xa6OK\xe2\x80\xa6 call me crazy on this one. Hey, I know the name coming up is not the quintessential leadoff guy \xe2\x80\xa6 I argued for this actually all the way back to early spring training \xe2\x80\xa6 OK \xe2\x80\xa6 here it comes: Nick Markakis. I know he is not the base stealing threat that is desired, but he works pitchers and gets on base at a decent percentage. And remember, this person only really leads off once a game most times.Markakis has proven to be a serviceable, if not approaching terrific, leadoff hitter for the Orioles this year. Few others hit at his pace. I would like to chart that for you, but that will have to wait for electricity to get to me.Complaining about the pitching rotation is a perennial Baltimore songAnd I was complaining about the pitching rotation as well, which is a perennial Baltimore song, but with good reason. But look at this paragraph and see if it does not make you feel better about where we are at here in 2014 at this point, compared to just two years ago.The Starting Rotation \xe2\x80\x93 How many in March would have predicted Jason Hammel and Wei-Yin Chen to be our 1-2 guys at the halfway point?\xc2\xa0 Brian Matusz and Tommy Hunter had to go down \xe2\x80\x93 where maybe someone there can help them the way someone somewhere helped Chris Tillman. So, let\xe2\x80\x99s go with Tillman for a while and hope for good things to repeat \xe2\x80\x93 but 97 mph in the 9th inning in not a fluke!!\xc2\xa0 Jake Arrieta is maddening. His ball has so much movement; how can he not dominate? And hopefully Zach Britton can be brought on to put together a solid second half. It is not crazy to imagine these five names being a winning combination.Of course, Tillman did really come through in a big way, as did an unknown fellow at the time \xe2\x80\x93 Miguel Gonzalez. Also, the bullpen was the strength of the team, which I commented upon positively in that piece.All in all, the Baltimore Orioles in July 2014 are in a much better place than were the Birds of 2012 in terms of personnel. Even so, it will be difficult to replicate a 49-32 second half, but they are off to a good start so far at 7-1. And unlike 2012, the rest of the AL East is not in the condition they were at that time. It is all very encouraging, even if it is still frustrating at times when men are left on base and starters don\xe2\x80\x99t get deep into a game. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"
07/10/2014,"[('Can the Orioles run away with the AL East? - Birds Watcher', 'Photo: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsIt may come as a shock around the baseball world that the Baltimore Orioles are in first place in July, but to Orioles fans it\xe2\x80\x99s not really a surprise. Most baseball experts selected Tampa Bay or the Boston Red Sox as the obvious choices to win the division, and predicted Baltimore as merely a middle-of-road team. However, that was not the case among Orioles fans. They saw a well-constructed roster with an extremely talented core of players, and a team that was in a playoff-or-bust season.After an up and down first three months the Orioles are finally getting consistent contributions from every aspect of the team. Also, as the Orioles seem to be finally hitting their stride the rest of the division is struggling with a mired of injuries and inconsistent play. Because of this, the Orioles are in prime position to really put some distance between them and the other teams in the division.The big news in the American League East this week was the injury to Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 ace Mashiro Tanaka. The right-hander had 12 of the teams 46 wins and was on his way to an All-Star game appearance and probable Rookie of the Year Award. However, his elbow stiffness forces him onto a D.L. that already includes fellow starters C.C. Sabathia, Michael Pineda and Ivan Nova.As of today the Yankees haven\xe2\x80\x99t even named a fifth starter and may not until after the All-Star break. The current rotation will welcome new additions Brandon McCarthy, who had ten losses and an ERA of almost five this season for Arizona, and Shane Greene, who will make his second career start Saturday against the Orioles and had an ERA of 4.61 in AAA this season.After a surprising surge that saw them briefly atop the division, the Blue Jays have lost 18 of their last 27 games going back to June 10th. Now to add to their troubles the Blue Jays added slugger Edwin Encarnacion to a D.L. that also includes Brett Lawrie, Adam Lind and Brandon Marrow. The Jays are hopeful Encarnacion will be back by the end of the month. However, a month without their best hitter may prove to be too much to keep pace in the division.There are analysts around baseball that continue not to give up on Red Sox and Rays finding their way back into contention. Maybe this is stubbornness from people who predicted them to win the division, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine a scenario where either team is relevant in September. As of Thursday, the Red Sox are 41-51 and the Rays are 42-52. If we\xe2\x80\x99re assuming the division winner will win around 90 games, that would mean that the Red Sox would need to go 49-21 and the Rays would need to go 48-20 the rest of the season. For two teams currently ten games under .500 that just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem logical.The Orioles have a vital three games series against the Yankees in Camden Yards to finish out the first half of the season. Then they begin the second half with a 10-game west coast trip immediately after the All-Star break. With the rest of the division struggling, the Orioles can use the next few weeks to distance themselves atop the division. Eventually, one of these teams will get healthy and attempt to make a run at the playoffs. Any lead the Orioles\xc2\xa0can build now could prove vastly important in August and September.

And I would submit that with the all-star break up and coming it might have behooved the Baltimore Orioles to send Norris on a bit of an elongated rehab assignment. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll touch on that later.  As Buck Showalter said after the game, Norris paid for the mistakes he made.  It might be a tough sell to argue that Norris wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready to start this game, but to say he was rusty might be fair. Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 4 IP, 6 H, 5 R, 1 BB, 2 K.I was a bit surprised to see the O\xe2\x80\x99s lift Norris when they did, however given that he was comingCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportsoff the DL I suspect they wanted to ensure he didn\xe2\x80\x99t overwork himself. Showalter had also made a few veiled references to potentially keeping Norris fresh in case he was needed in Sunday night\xe2\x80\x99s game against New York (presumably in a relief role).Washington came out with the idea of getting on base and getting runners in. As I said, Norris was high in the zone from the beginning, and lead off man Denard Span worked the count to 3-1 before grounding out. Anthony Rendon took advantage of the situation and stroked a double, and was then doubled home himself by Jayson Werth. Adam LaRoche would add an RBI-single, and the Orioles trailed 2-0. However the Orioles would put a run across in the last of the inning after Steve Pearce and Nelson Cruz walked, followed by Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-single.The best news coming out of last night\xe2\x80\x99s game could be that Davis\xe2\x80\x99 bat is starting to come alive again. He went 2-for-4 on the night with an RBI. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say what breaks guys out of slumps; was it hitting that clutch home run on Monday night? Was it the impromptu day off on Tuesday? Again, tough to say. However if Davis can start hitting and eventually hitting-for-power again, the Orioles will be in an even better spot than they are now.Washington catcher Wilson Ramos would homer in the second, and shortstop Ian Desmond would add one in the fourth (both solo shots). Again, this is what happens when you\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble keeping the ball down. And from Bud Norris\xe2\x80\x99 perspective, these types of games will happen \xe2\x80\x93 especially when you\xe2\x80\x99re coming off the DL and haven\xe2\x80\x99t pitched in a few weeks. Certainly he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t happy with the start, and the Baltimore Orioles as a team wishes it went better. However it\xe2\x80\x99s just something mechanically that he needs to work on to get back to where he was before the injury.Manny Machado stroked a homer of his own in the last of the fourth to bring the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within 4-2, however Washington would re-take that three-run lead an inning later on Adam LaRoche\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI. Jayson Werth would add a solo homer in the seventh, and Washington would take game one of this short series 6-2. On a positive note for the Birds, they only used two relievers in Brad Brach and Brian Matusz. In Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s case, he retired every batter he faced and struck out two.As I said above, I think it might have behooved the Orioles to send Bud Norris out on a rehab assignment. Granted his injury was a groin strain and had nothing to do with his pitching arm, however the fact is he still hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been in a live game since June 21st. Pitchers can go out on rehab assignments for up to 30 days. So given that the rotation was a bit backlogged as it was, and given that the all-star break is coming up, why not send Norris out on a rehab assignment in the minor leagues so he can get himself back up to speed? He probably could have been given a couple of starts to keep him on his pitching schedule and then activated when his turn would come up in the rotation.This is all hindsight for sure, and it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say if this was ever even considered. On the flip side, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are \xe2\x80\x9cin the grind\xe2\x80\x9d right now in terms of the standings, and the urgency to win today has to be the top priority. This short home series with Washington concludes tonight at Camden Yards with Wei-Yin Chen on the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Gio Gonzalez.

There is room for improvement and, as the trade deadline approaches, a modest trade to attempt to upgrade the rotation may not be out of the question.    In the midst of Wednesday\'s forgettable loss to the Nationals, Baltimore Sun reporter Dan Connolly unearthed one name the Orioles might be looking towards:  #Orioles have been looking for a starting P upgrade, and one guy they have been monitoring is Rockies LHP Jorge De La Rosa, source says\r \xe2\x80\x94 Dan Connolly (@danconnollysun) July 9, 2014     Jorge De La Rosa is a 33-year-old lefty starter who is in the last year of a four year, $42.5 million contract. He\'s started 18 games so far in 2014 and has been hit around to the tune of a 4.75 ERA. That\'s the kind of number that can make someone recoil in horror, as a Tolkien troll about to get caught in sunlight might do before turning to stone.    Before panicking too much, it\'s worth noting that ""monitoring"" is about as tepid of an indicator of interest as you are probably going to find. Teams are monitoring all sorts of players all of the time.    Why De La Rosa? One reason is probably that there is a prior connection with O\'s Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations Dan Duquette. During his tenure with the Red Sox, Boston purchased de la Rosa\'s contract from a Mexican League team. That was over a decade ago, but it\'s something. Statistically, while his numbers are repulsive, there is the fact that he\'s getting over 50% ground balls on the season, something that should play well with the Orioles infield. He\'s within a mile per hour of his velocity from his most successful season, averaging 92.6mph on the fastball this season, although according to Fangraphs, his fastball has never been his best pitch anyway. He throws the Dread Pitch Cutter as well, using it significantly for the first time this season.    Why not De La Rosa? The simple answer is that he\'s been bad this year, although he performed respectably last year (3.49 ERA, but only 167.2 innings in 30 starts). You might expect a Rockies pitcher to struggle at Coors Field and then do better on the road, but it\'s not the case for De La Rosa. He has a 3.73 ERA at home and a 5.87 ERA on the road. Another problem with De La Rosa is his walk rate, with a BB/9 of nearly 4. The Orioles already have one former Rockie who walks everything in sight, thanks. He is even supposed to have his ground ball rate as a strength, too. Add to that the possibility that he\'s actually been lucky to perform at that level - his BABIP of .259 is over 40 points below his career number, meaning that he could start giving up even more hits - and there\'s plenty of reason to look at him and say, do not want. What\'s more, unless the Rockies were to eat money in the deal, and if they did, they would demand a more significant return, the Orioles would be on the hook to pay De La Rosa the pro-rated portion of his $11 million salary this season.    Over a big league career that\'s spanned parts of 11 seasons and over a thousand innings, De La Rosa has a career ERA of 4.70. This year\'s performance is not an anomaly in terms of results when compared against the rest of his career. Expensive, disappointing starter who only averages about 5.1 innings per start, who would cost the Orioles something in trade as well? Thanks, but no thanks. Shaky as parts of the rotation can be, this sounds like one time where it\'s better to stick with the devil you know, even if that devil is Ubaldo Jimenez.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

On your way there, you will pass an artificial turf putting green, an orange-and-black pool table beneath a Tiffany lamp, a card table with a noisy automatic shuffler and a Ping-Pong table. Paddles and clubs and billiard balls are everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9cWe realize what we\xe2\x80\x99re here to do, and we\xe2\x80\x99re very businesslike \xe2\x80\x94 but we have a lot of fun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, a veteran reliever. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re going to play and go about your business and you\xe2\x80\x99re a good teammate, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll fit in and we\xe2\x80\x99ll welcome you, no matter what has happened.\xe2\x80\x9dThe way Cruz has hit this season, he would probably fit in anywhere. His overwhelming success \xe2\x80\x94 a .291 average, 28 homers and 74 runs batted in \xe2\x80\x94 has helped lift the Orioles to first place in the American League East as they prepare to host the Yankees this weekend.But Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s sense of belonging has also validated his decision to come here, for a discount deal of one year and $8 million, after serving a 50-game suspension for performance-enhancing drugs last summer.

Someone \xe2\x80\x94 Cruz or Manny Machado \xe2\x80\x94 had just made a big shot that demanded a loud celebration.

Credit             Patrick Semansky/Associated Press           Finally, Davis continued. He heard unfounded rumblings about himself last season, when he erupted for 53 homers, and spoke out often against steroid use, insisting he was clean. Now he plays with a hitter who accepted a ban for his role in the sordid Biogenesis affair that stained the sport last summer.

With their votes, the fans spoke loudest of all: Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s production merited a start in Minnesota, and they gave it to him.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cI had the chance to go last year, but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing better than to be elected by the fans,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo go because the fans want me there, it makes it more special.\xe2\x80\x9dCruz, 34, had a $10.5 million salary with the Texas Rangers last season, when he bashed 27 homers and drove in 76 runs in only 109 games. He missed the final 50 scheduled games and returned for the Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 one-game playoff, going 0 for 4 and making the final out in a loss to the Tampa Bay Rays.The suspension did not necessarily depress his value in free agency; another Biogenesis client, Jhonny Peralta, signed a four-year, $53 million contract with the St. Louis Cardinals. But Peralta\xe2\x80\x99s previous team, the Detroit Tigers, did not make him a $14.1 million qualifying offer. The Rangers made one to Cruz, who rejected it and found a frigid market.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame anybody for that decision,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have their reasons. But as a player, that\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing I know to do, play baseball. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sit at home. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of hard to not be able to play in spring training and go into the season and perform good. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Two players who waited to sign after the season started, Stephen Drew and Kendrys Morales, made more money than Cruz but have not hit well.

Credit             Jim Rogash/Getty Images           Those players, though, were not coming off suspensions. Cruz had enough isolation last summer.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s tough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes you realize how important baseball is for you and how much you love the game. Not being able to help your team go to the playoffs, it hurts more than anything. I was a big part of the team.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Dan Duquette, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 executive vice president for baseball operations, said Cruz wanted a \xe2\x80\x9cplatform to perform\xe2\x80\x9d this season, liked hitting at Camden Yards and knew Manager Buck Showalter, who had managed him in Texas. There was no question that Cruz wanted to play, Duquette said, and the Orioles got a steal \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps balancing their riskier four-year, $50 million deal for starter Ubaldo Jimenez, who is 3-8 and leads the A.L. in walks.

He looks for his pitch in the strike zone, hits down on the ball, and he has excellent work habits. To perform at his level, you have to do a lot of things right.\xe2\x80\x9dCruz has done things wrong, too, and those misdeeds are never far from the surface.After he homered against Boston\xe2\x80\x99s John Lackey last Saturday, Lackey declined to comment about Cruz.

Ortiz angrily insisted he had not gotten a free pass, as he had heard broadcasters suggest.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Cruz stayed above it. When reporters asked him about Lackey, he said that people were entitled to their opinions and that the only ones that mattered to him belonged to his teammates. They seem to like him just fine.  On a recent team flight, O\xe2\x80\x99Day said, he passed Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s seat while walking to the bathroom. While others played cards or goofed off, O\xe2\x80\x99Day said, Cruz studied video of the next day\xe2\x80\x99s starter. The two had played together with the Rangers, and O\xe2\x80\x99Day said he had never seen Cruz so diligent about his preparation.

Just sitting in the dugout, watching guys run bases and stuff, he\xe2\x80\x99s into every play. He loves every minute. So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure when that was taken away from him \xe2\x80\x94 by his own mistake \xe2\x80\x94 maybe he just realized how much he loves it again.\xe2\x80\x9d  A version of this article appears in print on July 11, 2014, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Silent for 50 Games, a Slugger\xe2\x80\x99s Bat Is Booming Again.

Adams fell a homer short of a cycle. Anthony Vasquez was solid over six innings. He allowed eight baserunners and struck out six. Frederick Keys 5, Salem Red Sox 4 The Keys pulled out a close one, but the story was Dylan Bundy\'s rough outing. Bundy was pulled with no outs in the fourth after allowing five hits, two walks and three earned runs up to that point. He did strike out two batters in the second, though.    The top of the Keys lineup paced the attack with each of Glynn Davis, Mike Yastrzemski and Trey Mancini putting up two hit performances. Yastrzemski also picked up his 15th outfield assist of the season.    Delmarva Shorebirds 4, Lakewood Blueclaws 5 Nick Cunningham hasn\'t yet adjusted to life in the Sally League. His second start since being promoted from Aberdeen was a bust as he gave up five runs in five innings. He actually held his own until he ran out of gas in the sixth inning, when three of the runs scored. Nothing much to speak of on offense. 3B Drew Dosch went 3-for-4 with a walk and C Austin Wynns singled and doubled.    Aberdeen Ironbirds 4, Batavia Muckdogs 0 How does a team score four runs on just four singles and three walks? Rookie ball, man. It\'s ridiculous. In two innings the Ironbirds scored runs thanks to a combination of errors by the other team, walks, and a few hits. And in each of those innings the Ironbirds made the last out on the basepaths. Fundamentals, boys! Their last run was manufactured by CF Jay Gonzalez, who singled and stole two bases, then came in on a sacrifice fly. Bennett Perry pitched five scoreless innings with only one hit allowed, but walked four. Dariel Delgado had a very good night, finishing the game with three innings of nine up, nine down baseball.

The AL East-leading Orioles improved to a season-high 10 games over .500 (51-41) and stretched their advantage over third-place New York to five games.Baltimore has gone to extra innings in three of its last five games and won in the 10th, 11th and 12th innings.""Usually, it\'s pitching and the bullpen doing well,"" manager Buck Showalter offered as an explanation.In this one, the Orioles got eight sharp innings from starter Miguel Gonzalez, a scoreless ninth from closer Zach Britton and a perfect 10th from T.J. McFarland (3-2).It all added up to Baltimore\'s ninth win in 12 extra-inning games this season.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Rollins\' HRs lead Phillies over Nats""I think it really speaks to the depth of our bullpen, the quality of our bullpen,"" Hundley said. ""T.J. McFarland comes in, does a great job going through the beginning of their order, a tough part, 1-2-3. And then with the offense that we have and the staunch bullpen, that combination lends itself to be successful \xe2\x80\x94 either late in the game or extra innings.""Machado began the game-winning uprising with a liner into the right-field corner off Adam Warren (1-5). After Ryan Flaherty struck out, Hundley hit an off-speed pitch into left-center that enabled Machado to score easily.""He just left a breaking ball up, that\'s all,"" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said of Warren. ""He\'s pitched extremely well for us, but he just left a breaking ball up. There\'s not much room for error there.""Playing as a visitor at Camden Yards for the first time, Yankees second baseman Brian Roberts homered on the first pitch he saw.

The Orioles defeated the Nationals 4-3. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAfter watching the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals play, it is not a ridiculous notion to imagine the two divisional leaders ending up in a World Series matchup against one another. A Battle of the Beltways World Series would be great for baseball, not to mention the Angelos family.Though the two teams will need to make up a game on August 4th in Washington, the abbreviated three-game series ended on Thursday night with a 4-3 Orioles victory. There were a lot of great moments and great plays made by both squads in the series. These are two very good teams who have mirrored one another all year with similar records. So why not plan to meet for their next series in October?The Nationals would have the edge in pitching, particularly with their great group of starters. And the Washington bullpen is among the best. Even so, the Orioles have over the course of this recent 35-game resurgence gotten rather good starting pitching, while the bullpen is certainly well above average.The Orioles would have the advantage on offense, particularly when able to use the designated hitter. Soon the Birds will be surpassing the Jays for the most home runs in baseball. Steve Pearce hit #113 for the O\xe2\x80\x99s on Thursday night to put them just three behind Toronto. Washington ranks 16th in MLB with a total of 77.I\xe2\x80\x99m glad they\xe2\x80\x99re somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s problem for a little whileMake no mistake about it, the Nationals have a lot of pop in their lineup. Anthony Rendon is a really nice-looking talent with all the tools. And there is Adam LaRoche, Ryan Zimmerman, Jayson Worth, and the speedy Denard Span. Ian Desmond and Bryce Harper are bound to hit better than their current statistical standing.Buck Showalter certainly agrees with this analysis, as he said in the postgame press conference, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a great club; I\xe2\x80\x99m glad they\xe2\x80\x99re somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s problem for a little while.\xe2\x80\x9dOn Thursday night, the Orioles got off to a 4-0 lead after three innings, but the Nationals continued to chip their way back into the game. Wei-Yin Chen had above-average stuff on this evening, and he needed it all to hold off the Nats. He recorded critical strikeouts to eliminate scoring threats in the fourth and fifth innings.Tommy Hunter bridged the gap after Chen\xe2\x80\x99s 5.2 innings to get to Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day in the eighth. Though the Nats would load the bases, O\xe2\x80\x99Day was able to escape the jam and give it off to Zach Britton to close successfully in the ninth.The Orioles were out-hit in the game 10-6, but a Desmond throwing error in the third inning (the first Nats error in 13 games) allowed what would prove to be the winning run to score.With the victory, the Orioles increased their lead over the inactive Jays to three games. And a Yankees loss to Cleveland drops them to four games behind the Orioles.Those Yankees come to town on Friday for the first time in 2014, and yes, that is really strange. Game #92 is the first Orioles home game against New York!However, all of this could prove to be fortuitous for the Orioles. The Yankees are currently just a game over .500 and appear to be headed in the opposite direction as do the surging Birds.How many injuries can the elderly Yanks absorb? At some point the fish needs to roll over and just go belly up. The latest of course is Masahiro Tanaka, who after his great start for the season, has been diagnosed with a partial ligament tear. A six-week program of rehab will be entered into with hopes that Tommy John surgery can be avoided and the ace of the staff can rejoin the Yankees for the end of the season.The NY rotation is already missing C.C. Sabathia, Ivan Nova and Michael Pineda. Also add Carlos Beltran to the injured list, as he suffered two small facial fractures in a batting-practice incident yesterday. He has been determined to have a concussion and was placed on the seven-day disabled list.More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryAll of this would appear to be good news for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 prospects for the weekend series, but Hiroki Kuroda will be pitching for the Yankees. At a rather pedestrian 4.20 ERA with a 6-6 record, Kuroda remains a thrower who has given the Orioles occasional fits over the years. Though he is 3-3 with a 3.15 ERA versus the O\xe2\x80\x99s, his WHIP number of 0.968 shows how effective he has actually been.Against Kuroda, Nick Markakis is 8-for-25 with two doubles and a homer, Adam Jones is 8-for-28 with a double, Chris Davis is 7-for-26 with two doubles and two home runs, and Manny Machado is 5-for-20 with a double and two home runs. But Nelson Cruz is 3-for-19, Steve Pearce is 1-for-7, and J.J. Hardy is only 3-for-27 with a double and homer.Miguel Gonzalez will take his 4-5, 4.22 ERA record to the mound. He has struggled a good bit since coming back from the disabled list. But Gonzalez has proven to be a decent asset against the Yankees. Though his record over eight starts is 2-2 with a 4.07 ERA, again the WHIP statistic of 1.192 demonstrates some adequate performance.Just one win over the weekend will assure that the Orioles will be alone in first place in the AL East at the All-Star break.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The New York Yankees came to Camden Yards looking to make up some ground on the AL East leaders.That might still happen, although the task became a bit tougher after a 3-2 loss to the Baltimore Orioles in 10 innings on Friday night.Manny Machado led off the 10th with a double off Adam Warren (1-5), who rebounded to strike out Ryan Flaherty before Nick Hundley lined a game-winning single to left-center.New York wasted a solid pitching effort by Hiroki Kuroda, who allowed three hits in seven innings but hit two batters and threw three wild pitches.""It was a big game today, and I wanted to go out there and perform well,"" Kuroda said through an interpreter.The defeat dropped third-place New York five games behind Baltimore. The teams play again Saturday and Sunday before heading into the All-Star break.""They\'re all hard,"" manager Joe Girardi said. ""You\'re playing Baltimore. Obviously they\'re in first place, and you don\'t want to lose a game like that. But you just want to come out and win tomorrow.""That\'s about what Warren had to say after yielding Hundley\'s single.""We\'re trying to gain games on these guys, and it just didn\'t go our way tonight,"" he said. ""We\'ll just come back tomorrow and try and get one back.""Machado began the game-winning uprising with a liner into the right-field corner, and Hundley hit an off-speed pitch into left-center that enabled Machado to score easily.""I\'m thinking strikeout there,"" Warren said. ""I threw two good sliders to him and got swings and misses. I was just trying to overthrow the last one and just left it up in the zone a little bit.""Playing as a visitor at Camden Yards for the first time, Yankees second baseman Brian Roberts homered on the first pitch he saw. Roberts spent his first 13 seasons with the Orioles before signing as a free agent with New York in January.Kelly Johnson also hit a solo shot for the Yankees, who entered with a major league-best 27-17 record in games decided by two runs or fewer. Now, however, they are only 5-5 in extra innings compared to 9-3 for Baltimore.Orioles starter Miguel Gonzalez allowed two runs and six hits over eight innings. After giving up a fourth-inning double to Ichiro Suzuki, the right-hander retired 14 of the final 15 batters he faced.Gonzalez struck out five and walked none. The eight innings matched his career high, set three times previously, including his last start against Boston.Roberts\' fifth homer put the Yankees up 1-0, and Johnson connected leading off the third.A single by Brian McCann and Suzuki\'s second double of the game put runners on second and third with one out in the fourth, but Gonzalez worked out of the jam.Baltimore took advantage of a wild spell by Kuroda to tie it at 2 in the bottom half.

For the 28th year, baseball fans are able to do their part to help the nearly 500,000 Marylanders who go without food. Close to 200,000 of those are children. Within the past two years, more than $50,000 in cash has been raised and nearly 14,000 pounds of food has been collected. \xe2\x80\x9cIt lets everybody know without a question that Baltimore has heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anglin.

After what Greene, a rookie, had just done for the Yankees, it was hard not to be impressed with his poise.\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have good stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s easy to have poise.\xe2\x80\x9dWith all the consternation over the injuries that have decimated the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 rotation, Greene, a little-known, wiry right-hander, took the mound for them on Saturday looking to provide some stability.The Yankees had faced the prospect of falling six games behind the Baltimore Orioles in the American League East standings, and usually in such cases, they would not have chosen to experiment with a rookie. But necessity dictated that they pin their hopes on a 25-year-old whose background includes Tommy John surgery in college and a 15th-round selection by the Yankees in the 2009 draft.

In his first start, he felt the jangle of nerves, but on Saturday, the nerves were converted into intense concentration.

Chase Whitley, another rookie, will make that start. But it will be hard to replicate what Greene has done.Like Whitley, Greene was thrust into the rotation last week partly as a result of the injuries to several starting pitchers: Ivan Nova, C. C. Sabathia, Michael Pineda and Masahiro Tanaka. Greene had impressed the Yankees in spring training, and then started to show poise and command as a starter in the minor leagues.

Baseball doesn\xe2\x80\x99t operate like we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on numerous occasions in the World Cup whereby a team can not score and win in penalty kicks!

Needless to say, Tillman was great but he and Oriole bats were the victim of a start by NY\xe2\x80\x99s Shane Greene that was just a little better. It took the Orioles until the fifth inning before scoring a base hit off of Greene, who was stingy with base runners all afternoon. The Orioles trailed 1-0 in the third after Mark Texeira sent an RBI-double into right field. However the highlight of the play was Nick Markakis combining with Ryan Flaherty\xc2\xa0and catcher Nick Hundley to\xc2\xa0put out Derek Jeter at the plate as he tried to score.

Jacoby Ellsbury would score Jeter on an RBI-double later in the inning, and the Orioles trailed 3-0.

Absalon-USA TODAY Sportsthrew home to Hundley as Ellsbury tried to score, and the tag nailed him at the plate. Manager Joe Girardi tried to argue the call, however there was no challenge.Incidentally, that play shows why my personal opinion is that the new\xc2\xa0blocking the plate rule makes no sense. Girardi tried to argue that Hundley was blocking the plate too early, thus without having the baseball. (The rule is that you can only block the plate if you have the ball.) At some point, we\xe2\x80\x99ll find ourselves in a situation where we\xe2\x80\x99re questioning\xc2\xa0if\xc2\xa0 the catcher had control of the ball, if it was squarely in his glove, etc.This sounds similar to the timeless argument of whether a wide receiver in the NFL had two feet down with possession of the ball. How often do we hear the question\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6oh did the ball move or change positions in the guy\xe2\x80\x99s hand?\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d hate to start seeing discussions like that in baseball with regard to whether the catcher was \xe2\x80\x9clegally\xe2\x80\x9d able to block the plate or not. These come across as very petty points in the moment during games.The Orioles went quietly in the ninth inning, and New York notched a 3-0 victory in game two of this series. Prior to the game the Birds made a roster move, sending Miguel Gonzalez down to triple-A Norfolk and recalling Baltimore-native Steve Clevenger. Similar to the Bud Norris move on Friday, this was done so as to keep Gonzalez on a steady work regiment during the all-star break. At some point I would expect both Norris and Gonzalez to be recalled during next weekend\xe2\x80\x99s series in Oakland.The series with New York concludes this evening, before a national television audience on ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday Night Baseball. Game time is just after 8 PM this evening at Camden Yards, with Kevin Gausman taking to the bump for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by NY\xe2\x80\x99s Chase Whitley.

The 'bright side' (if one wishes to take an optimistic view of things) is that 8 of those hits were singles, and 3 of the runs allowed were unearned, courtesy of 2 Jemile Weeks throwing errors. Further, two of the runs charged to Wright were allowed to score by the reliever who replaced him, Ramon Ramirez. Clay Rapada closed things down with 3 Ks in his one inning of work to earn the Win. The offense did what was necessary to keep the Tides in the game. (1B) Brett Wallace went 3 for 4 and hit his 10th dinger of the season. (3B) Cord Phelps went 2 for 4 with 2 RBI. (LF) Quintin Berry was this game's stat-sheet bingo winner, as he went 1 for 1, drew 2 walks, drove in 1, scored once, stole 1 base, got picked off once, and notched an outfield assist. Richmond (Giants) 0 Bowie 2 Zach Davies is so much fun. 7 shutout innings for him in this game. He allowed 6 singles, 1 double, and 1 walk. He threw 70 of his 98 pitches for strikes and induced 2 GIDPs. He K'd 4 and managed a 7:4 groundout to flyout ratio. This is his 4th shoutout outing of his last 5 starts. In those game he has totaled 26 IP, 12 H, 5 BBs, and 20 Ks. And he just turned 21 in February. I'd not be surprised if he forces his way into the top 5 of many Orioles prospect lists over the off-season. ( C ) Michael Ohlman and (SS) Garabez Rosa each went 2 for 3 with a double. (1B) Christian Walker went 0 for 1 but drew 2 walks and scored a run. In his 2 previous seasons, Walker managed to draw a total of 44 walks. He has 38 this season, and should be able to double that career total before season's end. Neat!

The Yankees defeated the Orioles 3-0. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt has certainly been a pattern this season, and even stretching to previous years, that the Baltimore Orioles seem to have great difficulty with rookie pitchers or throwers they have never seen before.On Saturday afternoon at Camden Yards, the newest Cy Young-like rookie sensation was the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 Shane Greene, who shut down the Orioles for 7.1 innings on four hits along with nine strikeouts. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to end up ranting a bit here, but make no mistake about it, this young man was very, very good. At the end, the Yankees prevailed 3-0.Even though Greene was the Yankees organization\xe2\x80\x99s minor league pitcher of the year in 2013, his stats this season were not honestly that great. He was pitching to a 4.61 ERA at AAA, with a batting average against that was approaching .300.\xc2\xa0 The Orioles should be able to handle someone like this, right? Nope\xe2\x80\xa6 it is enough to make one wish that Masahiro Tanaka or C.C. Sabathia were back \xe2\x80\x93 those are guys the O\xe2\x80\x99s can handle and defeat!But Greene had some awesome stuff. I have to reluctantly, but honestly, say that it is one of the very best pitching efforts I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in recent years against the Baltimore Orioles. The kid was great. His slider was terrific \xe2\x80\x93 lots of late break that caught the strike zone at the last instant or darted under the bat on a swing.However, the Orioles helped him out a lot, not that he really needed it. Chris Davis looks as lost as any hitter I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in a long time. With 105 strikeouts on the season, he is making Mark Reynolds look like a contact hitter. Davis has a 32% chance of a strikeout when he steps to the plate. The batting average is down to .197.It also looks like there is some increasing reason for concern about Nelson Cruz. Like Davis, he also struck out three times in this game. Over the past week or so, Cruz has begun to chase low-and-away breaking pitches in the vein of Adam Jones over the years (though Adam has grown in his ability to resist these balls). Surely the scouts around the league are seeing this; therefore that is what Cruz is going to see. He will have to figure this out and make the adjustments.The 4-5-6 hitters for the Orioles were a collective 0-for-12 with nine strikeoouts!While we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about those who struck out three times today, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the next batter in the lineup \xe2\x80\x93 J.J. Hardy. So yes, if you are doing the math in your head, this means that the 4-5-6 hitters in the O\xe2\x80\x99s lineup were a collective 0-for-12 with nine strikeouts!! Hardy so often will swing at the worst pitch in any given at-bat. Today in his final appearance against Greene, he watched two balls break over the plate, and then he swung and missed a breaking ball over a foot outside.But I\xe2\x80\x99ve saved my worst vitriol for Ryan Flaherty. In the seventh inning, Greene was clearly about totally empty. This was the moment for the Orioles to get back into the game. With two outs (the second one being the Hardy strikeout described above), he walked Manny Machado on four pitches. He then threw two balls well out of the zone to Flaherty, bringing the pitching coach to the mound to buy time for the bullpen to warm up. Again\xe2\x80\xa6 doing that math \xe2\x80\x93 that is six consecutive balls. What should a batter do in this situation with the score 3-0? Maybe if your last name is Puig or Trout or Cano you get a green light \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe. Or maybe if you are even just a .250 contact hitter you get a green light \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe, but probably not. But really, do you swing at it if you are a platooned player batting .226?\xc2\xa0 No! Why? Because YOU MIGHT JUST HIT A GROUND BALL INTO THE SHIFT AND END THE INNING!More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryChris Tillman pitched a reasonably good game.

Today just featured some stuff of great concern \xe2\x80\x93 in my view of things. There was some bad baseball today, even as we admit that they were facing a pitcher having a day he will never forget. OK \xe2\x80\xa6 let us forget it right now \xe2\x80\xa6 turn the calendar \xe2\x80\xa6On the final day before the All-Star Game, with the Orioles holding a three-game lead over the Jays and a four-game margin over the Yankees, Kevin Gausman will be called up for the fourth time this season and start for the Birds. He is currently 3-2 with a 3.51 ERA in his six appearances in the majors. He has not yet faced the Yankees this year.The Orioles will be facing Chase Whitley who is 4-2 with a 4.94 ERA. That ERA and the fact that he has given up 17 runs in the past nine innings is the good news. The bad news is that the Orioles have never seen this rookie before. Aw geez. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Adding De La Rosa Not Right Move for Orioles', 'Reports surfaced this week that the Orioles were looking hard at acquiring Colorado Rockies starter Jorge De La Rosa to boost their pitching staff before the trade deadline.De La Rosa, 33, has been in the major leagues for 11 years and posted a 4.69 career ERA and 1.463 WHIP. His career walk rate is 4.2 per nine innings. He stands to make $11 million this year \xe2\x80\x94 go ahead and stop me if these numbers are getting too enticing.After a more than shaky return from Tommy John surgery in 2012, De La Rosa burst back onto the scene with a vengeance in 2013 and had his best full season as a professional, going 16-6 with a 3.49 ERA.However, De La Rosa\xe2\x80\x99s 2013 effort was the only time he compiled an ERA under four in a full season any time in his career. This year, De La Rosa (10-6) has been back in-line with his career numbers, sporting a 4.56 ERA over 19 games.Nothing has been reported about what the Orioles would potentially give up to acquire De La Rosa, but whatever it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s too much. The Orioles have six starters who have a better track record of success than De La Rosa and/or have performed either comparably or better than him this season. Each of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters, Chris Tillman (4.11), Ubaldo Jimenez (4.52), Bud Norris (3.96), Wei-Yin Chen (4.15), Miguel Gonzalez (4.04), and Kevin Gausman (3.51) has a better ERA than De La Rosa in 2014.With De La Rosa in the fold, the Orioles would be forced to bump one of those guys to the bullpen, DL, or the minor leagues in Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s case.In addition to giving up a prospect in a potential trade and possibly picking up about half of De La Rosa\xe2\x80\x99s $11 million salary, the Orioles could be replacing one of their starters with an inferior talent.Most pundits agree that adding more pitching should be the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 goal before the trade deadline, but for me to jump on-board, that addition must be a significant improvement over the team\xe2\x80\x99s current rotation. Adding yet another average starter will not drive this team into the postseason.In 2014, the first-place Orioles are at a point where adding mediocre performance is no longer an upgrade. There\xe2\x80\x99s no point in making a move for the stretch run if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t improve the team, and adding De La Rosa doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to improve the team.

After Steve Pearce drew a walk in the bottom half, the rain came.The game was finally called after a delay of 2 hours, 22 minutes. The official time of game was 1:39.Baseball rules deem that a game is official if the home team is winning after the top of the fifth. Girardi doesn\'t like it.""My preference would be that you come back and finish it,"" he said. ""We\'re coming back, why don\'t we finish it? It would be changing what they\'ve done in the past, but I think it would be something to look at.""Gausman gave up four hits, struck out two and walked none in his first career complete game. The right-hander retired 12 of the final 13 players he faced to improve to 3-1 lifetime against the Yankees.Things didn\'t look so promising after Gausman gave up a homer to Gardner on the game\'s fourth pitch, but the Yankees didn\'t get a runner past first base the rest of the way.New York starter Chase Whitley (4-3) gave up three runs and five hits in 3 2-3 innings. He had been relegated to the bullpen after going 0-3 with a 14.81 ERA in his last three starts.Gardner gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead with his career-high ninth home run. It was the second homer allowed by Gausman this season, the first in 27 innings.""I knew right away that it was a bad pitch location. It was right down the middle,"" Gausman said. ""Honestly, I think it kind of woke me up a little bit.""Baltimore loaded the bases with two outs in the second before rookie Jonathan Schoop hit a routine fly ball to center.Whitley struck out two in a perfect third, but couldn\'t get out of the fourth. Nelson Cruz walked and Chris Davis snapped an 0-for-13 skid with his 15th homer, an opposite-field drive to left. J.J. Hardy followed with a double and Schoop chased Whitley with a two-out RBI single.""That last inning got away a little bit, but I felt good about tonight,"" Whitley said.In the top of the fifth, the grounds crew positioned itself behind the rolled-up tarp in anticipation of a rainstorm. As a fierce wind swirled around Camden Yards, lifting hot dog wrappers high in the air, Orioles right fielder Nick Markakis fell over after struggling to catch a knuckleballing fly for the second out.Soon after that, the rain came. Very long after that, the game was called.""Rain-shortened, five at-bats,"" Whitley said. ""That\'s a tough one.""Baltimore hit the break in first place in the AL East for the first time since 1997.""We have a goal of going out and winning the division this year,"" Davis said. ""We wanted to kind of control our own destiny. We\'re definitely in the driver\'s seat right now and hopefully we can keep it going.""Injury-riddled New York reached the midpoint at 47-47, five games back in third place.""With everything that we had go wrong, we\'re still in it,"" Girardi said. ""That\'s the big thing. We\'ve got to take advantage of that when we get back to work on Friday.""NOTES: Gardner has three career leadoff HRs, two this season. ... The Orioles formally put RHP Ubaldo Jimenez (ankle) on the 15-day disabled list to make room for Gausman, who was recalled from Triple-A Norfolk. ... The Yankees recalled RHP Bryan Mitchell from Triple-A Scranton-Wilkes-Barre and optioned OF Zoilo Almonte to the same club. ... Baltimore\'s Manny Machado singled in the second inning to reach base for a 16th consecutive game, tying his career high.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

The Yankees cannot avoid looking a great deal like a downhill racer wobbling on one ski, veering toward disaster, as they enter the All-Star Game break having lost four of six to finish a long trip, and having also lost the ace Masahiro Tanaka to an elbow injury along the way.Tanaka was supposed to start Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game. Instead, he was back in New York treating a partial tear and inflammation in an elbow ligament that will sideline him for at least six weeks.With four of their five original starters out with injury, the Yankees have taken the form of a carnival booth to filling the rotation: Step right up and have a try. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      A rookie starting pitcher has taken the mound 45 times out of 94 games, a franchise record before the All-Star break. The results have been mixed, from very good to very bad, but it is a dichotomy the Yankees have to stomach for now. On Saturday, Shane Greene pitched seven and a third shutout innings in his second career start. On Sunday, the Yankees turned to Chase Whitley, who had a 14.81 earned run average in his three previous starts, all losses, to take the mound.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Not all too surprisingly, the Orioles hit Whitley hard. Baltimore, one of the American League\xe2\x80\x99s hottest teams, is a good offensive team, heating up with the summertime thermometer. And opponents were batting close to .500 against Whitley in his previous four outings.Whitley did manage to retire five of the first six batters he faced, and he worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the second without allowing a run. But Baltimore eventually broke through in a three-run fourth. The hits, hard hits, piled up quickly. Chris Davis golfed a low sinker into the stands in left for a two-run homer. J. J. Hardy then doubled, Manny Machado hit a hard groundout, Jonathan Schoop singled, and Whitley was finished before getting out of the inning.\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a strong guy,\xe2\x80\x9d Whitley said of Davis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to tip your hat. I got him once and he got me.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Manager Joe Girardi was looking at cobbling the rest of the game together with the bullpen, until the rains came in the fifth, forewarned by gusting winds that sent napkins and wrappers flying all over the field, and caused a routine pop-up by Kelly Johnson to knuckle so aggressively in the outfield that Nick Markakis wound up sprawling out to catch it.

Privacy Policy     The Yankees jumped on the board on the fourth pitch of the game from the right-hander Kevin Gausman, which was transplanted over the wall in right by Brett Gardner, one of the few bright spots in the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 lineup so far this season.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s home run gave him nine, a new career high, and tied him with Carlos Beltran for the third-most on the team. It also gave the Yankees their 80th home run of the first half, just ahead of the Seattle Mariners for ninth place in the A.L. The Yankees are 12th in on-base percentage and on-base-plus slugging percentage and 13th in runs scored.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Before the game, Girardi acknowledged how fortunate the team was to be in the A.L. East, which has finally weakened after more than a decade as one of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s strongest divisions. With a .500 record, the Yankees are still only five games back of the division-leading Orioles. \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWith everything we\xe2\x80\x99ve had go wrong, we\xe2\x80\x99re still in it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after the loss. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take advantage of that when we get back to work on Friday.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The team\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on rookie pitchers comes fraught with obvious concern, however. Girardi described two issues that routinely confront rookie pitchers as they progress throughout the season. There is a physical toll \xe2\x80\x94 with more stressful innings and a longer season that extends beyond the minor league limit \xe2\x80\x94 as well as a mental one.

That's exactly what the Orioles got from Gausman as they beat the Yankees, 3-1, although the way it happened was not what anyone would have guessed. Thanks to rain, the teams only played through the top of the fifth.    After a 2:20 delay the umpires finally ended it and let everyone head off to their All-Star Break plans. As one Baltimore writer quipped on Twitter, they were in danger of running into the first Home Run Derby where a player could not participate due to having a regular season game still going on. The delay lasted longer than the game itself. Things did not start out so smoothly in Gausman's latest return to the majors. He gave up a home run to Brett Gardner, the first batter he faced in the game, and ended up giving up hits to three of the first five batters he faced. It's a good thing for the Orioles that one of the hits did not result in a baserunner. Mark Teixeira hit a ball to the right field wall and decided to challenge Nick Markakis by going for a double. This was a poor decision in retrospect, as Teixeira was just slow enough and Markakis' throw in from right was just off the bag enough that J.J. Hardy came far off the bag to fetch the throw right as Teixeira was passing by.    With two outs, that ended the first inning, so when Brian McCann got a single himself, that was in the second inning. In fairness to Gausman, this single was the sole result of Manny Machado making a boneheaded play, giving up on a pop-up as it floated back into left field even though he appeared to signal to left fielder Steve Pearce that he'd caught the ball. The official scorer, generous as ever to hitters, scored the play as a hit.    Following that, Gausman retired 12 of the next 13 batters, with the lone hit being a third inning Derek Jeter single. Gausman did not walk a batter in this shortened outing. Those 13 batters took him to the end of the game, not that we knew it at the time. in Gausman's peculiar complete game, he went five innings, gave up four hits (but it was really only three), one run, no walks, and had two strikeouts. He threw 78 pitches. The Orioles didn't score until the fourth inning against Yankees starter Chase Whitley, who had a 14.80 ERA over his three previous starts. They loaded the bases in the second inning but it came with two outs, so a Jonathan Schoop fly ball to deep center did not have any material significance for the game's outcome. I heard that phrase on a World Cup game and just wanted to try it out, sorry.    The fourth inning breakout started, as many good things do, with a walk. It is, in general, a good idea in the year 2014 to maybe pitch around Nelson Cruz a little bit to get a chance to pitch to Chris Davis, who is real good at grounding into the shift. On a 1-1 pitch, Whitley threw a pitch around his shins and Davis went down and got it, driving it to the opposite field. Even this version of Davis is still a big, strong man; the ball flew to left and cleared the fence by a couple of feet for his 15th home run of the year. That gave the Orioles a 2-1 lead. Following the home run, Hardy went opposite field for a double. He would score two batters later on a single by Jonathan Schoop that went, you guessed it, to the opposite field - just over a jumping Brian Roberts. After the third Orioles run scored, Yankees manager Joe Girardi had seen enough of Whitley and pulled the plug. For once, the Orioles did damage to the guy they should beat.    The wind came during the pitching change, great gusts that sent garbage swirling across the Camden Yards infield. The radar was ominous, a lengthy delay was imminent. Markakis grounded out to reliever David Huff to send the game into the top of the fifth inning, after which the game would be official. You know this scenario almost never happens except in jokes. The team takes the lead just in time for the game to become official, then the rain arrives. On Sunday night, they had to get through one more half-inning, with winds blowing every direction at once. One wild pop-up in the top of the fifth looked like it changed directions three times on Markakis and he ended up falling over as he caught it. The flags in left-center billowed out, the flags on the flag court blew strongly to the right. It was wild. Every ball in the air was a reason to be nervous. Yangervis Solarte grounded out to third and with that, the game was official. Pearce led off the fifth inning with a walk, then the rains came in earnest. Though it took them a long time to get there, eventually, after midnight, the game was called and the Orioles were victorious. It's anticlimactic, but they all count the same in the standings. The rain-shortened win sends the Orioles into the All-Star Break with a 52-42 record and a lead of four games in the division over the second place Blue Jays, who lost earlier Sunday. The O's won seven of ten to close out the first half of the season. They needed every win they could get because they'll start off the second half of the season with a ten game West Coast road trip. Those are the good teams this year, and that's who the O's will have to beat on the road to maintain their place in the standings when the season resumes.    The next Orioles game is not until Friday at 10:05pm Eastern. Prepare yourself for the long haul. No one knows yet who's starting for the Orioles because like all of their starters are in the minor leagues, but O's hitters will be facing new Athletics acquisition Jeff Samardzija.

Chris Davis hit a two-run homer, Gausman allowed one run in five innings and the Baltimore Orioles beat the New York Yankees 3-1 Sunday night in a game shortened by rain. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great,\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman said. \xe2\x80\x9cComplete game in 78 pitches. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a record.\xe2\x80\x9d The Orioles scored all their runs in the fourth inning before Gausman (4-2) got three straight outs in the fifth. After Steve Pearce drew a walk in the bottom half, the rain came. The game was finally called after a delay of 2 hours, 22 minutes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s extremely disappointing,\xe2\x80\x9d Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the game would have been 10 minutes slower, we would never have got to that spot. It\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d Baseball rules deem that a game is official if the home team is winning after the top of the fifth. Girardi would like to see that change. \xe2\x80\x9cMy preference would be that you come back and finish it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re coming back, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we finish it? It would be changing what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the past, but I think it would be something to look at.\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman gave up four hits, struck out two and walked none. The right-hander retired 12 of the final 13 players he faced to improve to 3-1 lifetime against the Yankees. Things didn\xe2\x80\x99t look so promising after Gausman gave up a leadoff homer to Brett Gardner, but the Yankees didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a runner past first base the rest of the way. New York starter Chase Whitley (4-3) gave up three runs and five hits in 3 2-3 innings. He had been relegated to the bullpen after going 0-3 with a 14.81 ERA in his last three starts. Gardner gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead with his ninth home run \xe2\x80\x94 a career high \xe2\x80\x94 on the fourth pitch of the game. It was the second homer allowed by Gausman this season, the first in 27 innings. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew right away that it was a bad pitch location. It was right down the middle,\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman said. \xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, I think it kind of woke me up a little bit.\xe2\x80\x9d Baltimore loaded the bases with two outs in the second before rookie Jonathan Schoop hit a routine fly ball to center. Whitley struck out two in a perfect third, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get out of the fourth. Nelson Cruz walked and Davis snapped an 0-for-13 skid with his 15th homer, an opposite-field drive to left. J.J. Hardy followed with a double and Schoop chased Whitley with a two-out RBI single. In the top of the fifth, the grounds crew positioned itself behind the rolled-up tarp in anticipation of a rainstorm. As a fierce wind swirled around Camden Yards, lifting hot dog wrappers high in the air, Orioles right fielder Nick Markakis fell over after struggling to catch a knuckleballing fly for the second out. Soon after that, the rain came. Very long after that, the game was called. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was kind of getting ridiculous because it was 12:15,\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman said. \xe2\x80\x9cI made the joke, `We\xe2\x80\x99re pretty much on the All-Star break.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x98 Baltimore hit the break in first place in the AL East for the first time since 1997. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a goal of going out and winning the division this year,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe wanted to kind of control our own destiny. We\xe2\x80\x99re definitely in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat right now and hopefully we can keep it going.\xe2\x80\x9d Injury-riddled New York reached the midpoint at 47-47, five games back in third place. \xe2\x80\x9cWith everything that we had go wrong, we\xe2\x80\x99re still in it,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the big thing. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take advantage of that when we get back to work on Friday.\xe2\x80\x9d NOTES: Gardner has three career leadoff HRs, two this season. \xe2\x80\xa6 The Orioles formally put RHP Ubaldo Jimenez (ankle) on the 15-day disabled list to make room for Gausman, who was recalled from Triple-A Norfolk. \xe2\x80\xa6 The Yankees recalled RHP Bryan Mitchell from Triple-A Scranton-Wilkes-Barre and optioned OF Zoilo Almonte to the same club. \xe2\x80\xa6 Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Manny Machado singled in the second inning to reach base for a 16th consecutive game, tying his career high.

07/15/2014,"[('Get to know your Orioles: Nelson Cruz - Camden Chat', ' All the pundits called it a ""steal"". Nelson Cruz for $8 million? There is no way this can go wrong. A thousand analysts can\'t be wrong. Oh yeah...they weren\'t. He has been a smashing success, second in the league in both home runs and RBI. But Cruz was no overnight phenom in the baseball world. It was a long windy road.    Bio Name: Nelson Ramon Cruz Number: 23Born: July 1, 1980 (34 years old) in Las Matas de Santa Cruz, Dominican RepublicHeight: 6\'2"" Weight: 230 lbsBats: Rightt Throw: RightSigned: As an amateur free agent by the New York Mets on February 17,1998School: Monte Crisit, DOContract: $8,000,000 in 2014 (Free agent this offseason)Became an Oriole: Signed as a free agent on February 24, 2014Walk-up Song: ""Para Ti"" by: Juan Luis GuerraTwitter: @ncboomstick23 Cruz is from the north western part of the Dominican Republic; very close to the Haitian border. He shares his first name with his father. Together with Dominga, Nelson\'s mother, the elder Cruz raised three children: Nelson and his two sisters; Olga and Nelsy (man, they REALLY like the name Nelson). They lived in a rented home with three beds between the five of them. Both Dominga and Nelson Sr. were teachers; Dominga, elementary school; Nelson, high school social studies. Nelson\'s middle name comes from his grandfather, Ramon. He was a farmer who raised cows, bulls and rice. It had such an impact on Cruz as a child that he now owns a farm in the Dominican.    As a boy, Cruz would split time between school, his grandfather\'s farm and his uncle\'s auto shop. It was basically anything his father could get him to do to keep busy and out of trouble.    ""If you don\'t have free time, you don\'t have time to do wrong,"" Nelson Sr. recently told the Baltimore Sun. Despite all of this, the Orioles All-Star had time for sports. His favorite? Basketball. He chose hoops over hardball because he worked long hours, six days a week. When he was finally off it was dark out. The fields near him had no lights and no teams met on Sundays, his one day off. The courts, however, did have lights.    It wasn\'t until Nelson was a teenager, nearly out of school, that he played baseball regularly. It didn\'t take long for scouts to notice his ability. Mets\' scout Eddy Toledo approached Nelson and told him he wanted to see him play. The future Major Leaguer struck out three times the game Toledo attended, but it wasn\'t enough to keep him away. They got to work on a deal. The only thing that halted talks was Nelson Sr.\'s insistence that the younger Cruz finish high school before training with the Mets minor leaguers in the Dominican. They would work things out and put pen to paper, making Cruz a professional. After that, things got difficult for Cruz. In fact he wouldn\'t even leave the Dominican in a Mets uniform. He played there for parts of three seasons and, despite hitting .351 with 15 home runs in 2000, New York felt he wasn\'t progressing enough and sent him to Oakland in exchange for Jorge Velandia.    The Athletics organization really let him put his mark on minor league baseball, climbing from the Arizona Fall league to Triple-A Sacramento in parts of four years. However, he saw just four games of action in Sactown in 2004. It\'s possible that Oakland felt his development was taking a bit too long. Whatever the reason, he was sent to Milwaukee along with Justin Lehr in a trade for Keith Ginter. From there, he would tear through the Brewers double-A opponents and hit well enough in Triple-A to get his first cup of Major League coffee with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2005. But it was only eight games as a September call-up. He would start the 2006 season at Triple-A Nashville for the Brewers until the season\'s trade deadline approached. In a fairly big blockbuster move at the time, Milwaukee sent both Cruz and Carlos Lee to Texas in a swap for Laynce Nix, Kevin Mench, Francisco Cordero, and Julian Cordero. Cruz would get his first crack at a full time gig in the bigs. It wouldn\'t last as he showed big power but poor discipline at the plate. It caused him to yo-yo between the minors and majors for the next two seasons. He was too good for a farm team, but just couldn\'t hack it with the big club. I mean, look at this: the Rangers brought him up in 2007 for 96 games. While there he slashed .235/.287/.384 with 9 home runs, 34 RBI, 21 walks, and 87 strikeouts. With Triple-A Oklahoma City that same season he slashed .352/.428/.698 with 15 home runs and 45 RBI in 44 games. It was night and day.    Texas had lost so much hope that in 2008 he was placed on waivers. Any team could have had him for $20,000. No takers, and it\'s a good thing for the Rangers. Over the next season he would establish himself as a regular; a fixture in a team that would go to the playoffs three straight years from 2010 to 2012, winning the pennant twice. And then, 2013 happened. Cruz was tabbed as one of those involved in the Biogenesis scandal. The same investigation that nabbed Ryan Braun and Alex Rodriguez for lengthy suspensions. It was an unfortunate chain of events that Cruz claimed to be involved with to rehabilitate from a gastrointestinal infection that caused him to lose 40 pounds. Evidence to the contrary, such as an incongruent timeline of Cruz\'s purchase of drugs and his recovery, lead some to Whatever the case, it left Cruz as an unknown commodity come this past winter. Something that the Orioles took advantage off. If you are reading this, you are well aware of that. Aside from Biogenesis, Cruz appears to be very successful off the field. He has been married to his wife Solanyi for nearly five years. The two tied the knot on Christmas Day in 2009. They have two children; a son, 5-year-old Nelson (again with all these Nelsons), and a daughter, 1-year-old Jiara. The three live in a downtown apartment that they are renting for the season. They will all be cheering him on as he bats sixth for the AL squad in tonight\'s All-Star game, right in front of teammate Adam Jones.    Maybe this is the only season he will be in Oriole black and orange, but he is making it one to remember.

Going by pre-All Star Break records, the Orioles won't even see a .500 team until they play the Yankees on August 11th. \xc2\xa0They won't see a sub-.500 team until they face the White Sox on August 18th.

07/17/2014,"[('Tomorrow starts ""the season"" for the Baltimore Orioles', 'MLB teams all play 162 games, and it\xe2\x80\x99s cliche` to submit that they all count the same. Guess what folks? \xe2\x80\x93 they do. However you can\xe2\x80\x99t go through the season and after seeing how it ebbs and flows argue that some games aren\xe2\x80\x99t just a bit more important based on where teams are in the standings, how they\xe2\x80\x99re playing, etc. That\xe2\x80\x99s a part of any sport, and baseball is no exception.So I would submit that the next two-and-a-half weeks (beginning tomorrow) are the most important of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. There are some reading this who will disagree given the fact that each game still only counts as one in the standings. However again, each season ebbs and flows differently. Tomorrow night the O\xe2\x80\x99s will head to Oakland for three (games), Anaheim for three, SeattleCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportsfor four, and then after a day off at home they\xe2\x80\x99ll host Anaheim and Seattle each for three games.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are of course ten games above .500, however if they were an AL West team they\xe2\x80\x99d only be in third place. The successes of Oakland have been well-documented league wide, and Anaheim and Seattle have come on well of late also. So due to the competition that the Orioles will be facing, this next sequence of upcoming games could very well factor into the end game for the 2014 season.Again, some people aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to like that blanket statement, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. However the Orioles probably started playing their best baseball in the 2-3 weeks leading up to the all-star break. Look north of the border to Toronto; they played their best baseball in May and June. It seemed like for quite some time that team just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose. When teams are getting what appear to be base hits only to have their players thrown out at first base from the outfield, you know you\xe2\x80\x99re really in control of things.Toronto was being crowned as the princes of the AL East for quite a few weeks \xe2\x80\x93 and then they hit the west coast. They were swept in a four-game set in Oakland, and they dropped two-of-three in Anaheim. So the question is whether or not that was due to the fact that they were playing the west, or because perhaps they were having a weak stretch, or maybe something else\xe2\x80\xa6? That\xe2\x80\x99s beside the point in reality. The point here is that the AL West is a tough division. The O\xe2\x80\x99s found that out first hand in June when Oakland took two-of-three at Camden Yards.And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this upcoming stretch will end up as the most important stretch of the season \xe2\x80\x93 in my view. The Orioles are only in first place to begin with because they were coming on strong while Toronto was getting their behinds handed to them on the west coast. The road trip starts in Oakland, which as we all know is not an easy park in which to play. It\xe2\x80\x99s long been heralded as the most miserable park out there from the perspective of visiting ballplayers. However the past few seasons the Birds have had some respectable showings there, and the dimensions of the park might play well for Oriole pitchers who at times can have trouble keeping the ball in the yard.Fans will remember the September 2012 trip to Oakland in which the Orioles were able to steal some games so as to assist in getting them to the post season. However all of that is in the past; this upcoming trip this weekend is what they need to focus on right now. And as I said, the road doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get any easier; Anaheim was coming on strong at the break, and Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s overachieved thus far in 2014.Let\xe2\x80\x99s not kid ourselves however, as the reverse is also true; those teams can\xe2\x80\x99t be particularly thrilled to see the Orioles pop up at this time. The fact is that either way, the entire league will have been off since Sunday. So there could be a certain unpredictability to quite a few teams coming up this weekend. Bear in mind, the fact that I say these games in the next two weeks plus are the most important doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that they count any more or any less than any other games. I just believe that based on how the season has shaken down thus far, we\xe2\x80\x99ll point back to this coming sequence of games and say that they were the key to whatever happened in the end.

Of course, I did not expect Myers to get hurt and Keirmair to step in and to perform better than Myers. Myers was not hitting well even before his injury, with both his BABIP and ISO dropping off a cliff. No one saw Kiermaier coming. He was on the edge of most of Top Rays Prospects lists, regarded as great fielder who may not have the bat to stay in the lineup. He has only hit 8 HR in 170 PA since then, more than he has in any full season in the minors in the past. His UZR number has matched his scouting report.

It turns out to be the opposite of that. This does not mean that the Yankees would have been better at RF if that was the case. Beltran has been terrible even when he is playing as the DH. Soriano has been released. Ichiro is his usual light hitting self. For the record, these 3 players are combined 115 years old. Maybe I should have seen this coming.   So I was right about the Blue Jays and Jose Bautista, but I was quite wrong about the Red Sox and the Yankees. I have the excuses of injury for the Rays and Red Sox, but I lucked into being right about the Rays anyway. Nothing has been extremely surprising, except for Kevin Kiermaier.

07/18/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles, Manny Machado need to keep things square', 'The Baltimore Orioles as a team and Manny Machado as an individual need to both remember where they are this weekend, that being Oakland. In saying that, I mean that things beat to the tune of a different drum out in \xe2\x80\x9cCali\xe2\x80\x9d as they call it\xc2\xa0(\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9dvacay\xe2\x80\x9d anyone?!). Things aren\xe2\x80\x99t quite as intense as they are here on the east coast. That aside, this will be the first time since the incident involving Josh Donaldson that the Orioles and Machado will be facing Oakland. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into detail about that situation as it\xe2\x80\x99s been well documented here on Birds Watcher, the fact that the teams are meeting again is noteworthy.The obvious question is whether or not there will be any backlash involving the two teams and/or Machado directly. On one hand, one might argue that it\xe2\x80\x99s the Orioles who have the ball in their court on that. After all, Machado was in fact the last player to be hit in the sequence of events. However let\xe2\x80\x99s also not forget that this is an Oriole team that\xe2\x80\x99s in a pennant race right now \xe2\x80\x93 as is Oakland.  Does it not stand to reason that both teams seemingly have a lot to lose? You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall a few weeks ago when Boston\xe2\x80\x99s John Lackey made a few veiled comments about Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s suspension for PED\xe2\x80\x99s. At the time, I\xc2\xa0tweeted\xc2\xa0that the Orioles needed to be careful not to get into anything with Boston. Bad teams will often try to start something with good teams so as to throw them off. In this case, both teams are good. However the fact is that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are in a much more precarious position than is Oakland given the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re on the opposite coast. This is a huge road trip for the Birds, and they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to have outside distractions.I would suspect that Manny Machado won\xe2\x80\x99t be received particularly well by the Oakland fans. But that\xe2\x80\x99s to be expected. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking moreCourtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY Sportsabout on-field matters than anything else. I will say that umpires are briefed prior to series\xe2\x80\x99 about any past issues between the two sides. So the incident with Donaldson and the bat throw will be aware to the umps.They can also issue warnings\xc2\xa0before games begin \xe2\x80\x93 such as when the managers exchange lineup cards. If I were the umpires for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game, I\xe2\x80\x99d consider doing that. Both managers would probably argue that it would take their pitchers\xe2\x80\x99 ability away to pitch inside, however it might also dissuade anyone from doing anything regrettable.And regardless of what anyone thinks of Machado coming out of that unfortunate incident, it should be noted that he handled himself as well as he could in the aftermath. Not only has he played well, but he also sat his suspension without opening his mouth further and left it at that. I would submit that there might well have been more than meets the eye in that incident. I can speak from experience in that I\xe2\x80\x99ve flung my share of bats at people in my life when I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to my wit\xe2\x80\x99s end about a given situation. By that I mean that I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to a point where I\xe2\x80\x99ve snapped and done or said regrettable things. (No, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never actually thrown\xc2\xa0a baseball bat at someone.)Given Machado\xe2\x80\x99s decorum since that time as well as\xc2\xa0how he\xe2\x80\x99s played on the field, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not out of the realm of possibility that he was dealing with a personal issue at the time that was eating at him. Not that this was the fault and/or problem of Josh Donaldson or anyone on Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s team, however I suppose what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that I recognize the symptoms. In terms of his play on the field, after that incident was over it\xe2\x80\x99s been like a weight was lifted off of Machado\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders.So my advice to the Orioles is to stay cool this weekend. Certainly if multiple Oriole batters start getting hit, that might need to be evaluated again, however I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that to happen (neither that nor the inverse). In fact if I were the Orioles I\xe2\x80\x99d tell Machado not to even talk to the media during this series, so as to not have anything misconstrued as a negative comment towards the opponent or even the fans. As I said, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be boo\xe2\x80\x99d royally this weekend, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to deal with. But the less that incident is brought up or referenced by Machado and the Orioles, the better.

Among these is the difficulty the O\xe2\x80\x99s have faced with winning games at home. They finally put themselves in positive numbers over the final homestretch, as their 52-42 record breaks down to 26-23 at home and 26-19 on the road.Another strange feature is the number of times the Oriole were pretty much shut down effectively by young, rookie pitchers that they had not seen before. But the Birds were able to beat Masahiro Tanaka, Justin Verlander, Jon Lester, Clay Buchholz, R.A. Dickey, and Mark Buehlre among others.So, maybe it is a good thing that the Orioles start out the final 68-game push on the road, facing the best team in baseball (by current record) in the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s, doing so in their total crap stadium, and seeing Jeff Samardzija throw against them. (I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ve never typed his name before and I pasted it into the article! I wonder how old he was before he learned how to spell his last name.)Samardzija has, of course, recently come to the A\xe2\x80\x99s from the Chicago Cubs, after having had a tremendous start to his 2014 season. At the time of the trade, he was 2-7 with a 2.83 ERA. In his two games with Oakland he is 1-1, giving up only four runs on nine hits in 15 innings.However, over the six full seasons with the Cubs from 2008-2013, he was a combined 29-35 with a 4.19 ERA and WHIP of 1.355.\xc2\xa0 These are not terrible numbers, since they were done with, yes, a terrible team; but they are, at best, rather ordinary.So, the bad news is that few Orioles have ever batted against him. Nick Hundley is 1-for-7, while Steve Pearce is 0-for-4 and J.J. Hardy hitless in two attempts.But the news for Oakland batters against Baltimore Orioles starter Chris Tillman is not much better. They are a combined 7-for-49 (.143), and Tillman is 1-0 over 18.1 innings against the A\xe2\x80\x99s with 18 strikeouts.

Though not a prospect, Marrero, the former first rounder doubled and homered, but the night belonged to AA debutante Yastrzemski. The thoroughbred from Vanderbilt went 4-5, including a triple and two runs. Garabez Rosa continued his solid season with a homer and a single. Johnny Ruettiger also had a a pair of singles and a steal. Ruettiger has only stolen seven bases this year after taking 44 last year and 28 the previous year.    Frederick Keys 5, Salem Red Sox 3 Brady Wager is not a guy that earns a lot of style points on the mound, but he's probably one of the best sinkerballers in the system. This season, Wager has pitched to a 57% groundball rate. The only time he's achieved a higher rate in his career, was in half as many starts at Delmarva last year. In his start against the Red Sox, Wager induced seven groundouts in five innings and allowed three earned runs. Dennis Torres, a relative newcomer to the Keys earned the four inning save shutting the Red Sox out the rest of the way.    It might be sort of damning with faint praise to say that Jason Esposito has had one of his best offensive seasons in the system this year. After all, the 2011 second round pick is nearly 24 and has logged almost 700 at bats at Frederick without breaking through. He's shown some value this season, though, as a bit of lefty masher, slashing .333/.383/.488 against lefties this year. On this night, Esposito doubled off of righty Pat Light. Wynston Sawyer also walked twice to raise his July OBP to .357 and Glynn Davis stole his 19th base of the year. Catching for the Red Sox, was Jordan Weems, brother of former O's farmhand Chase Weems.    Delmarva Shorebirds 5, Greensboro Grasshoppers 0 I still have no real idea who Luis Gonzalez is. I feel safe in saying, however, that he's good enough for the Sally League. Gonzalez has allowed two or fewer earned runs in eight of his ten starts. He doesn't seem to have an arsenal chock full of swing and miss stuff, but struck out five Grasshoppers and induced eight groundouts. Austin Urban and Big Jon Keller helped preserve the shutout. Keller has struck out 66 batters in 56.2 innings. Drew Dosch and Creede Simpson doubled while Austin Wynns had three singles. Wynns might be a sleeper catching prospect. Wynns has thrown out 35% of would be base thiefs and has only been charged with two errors. If you're a believer in baseball-reference's range factor, he rates well there, too (8.81). He's had a really nice July at the plate (.457/.524/.486) and his .329 OBP on the year is a nice improvement over his .284 2013 season.

07/19/2014,"[('Orioles luck turns abruptly in ninth, Josh Donaldson gives ...', "" A swinging bunt single, a broken bat blooper, and then a three run home run. The only thing keeping it from being glorious is the fact that it was the Athletics who benefited from these things on Friday night as the Orioles lost, 5-4. The three run home run came from Josh Donaldson in the ninth inning as the Orioles led, 4-2.    As they say, that escalated quickly. There was nothing to the swinging bunt or the bloop other than plain old bad luck. Then Zach Britton left the wrong pitch hanging in the wrong place to the wrong batter and the second half started off with a loss where it should have been a win. That one hurts, all the moreso because the triumph would have been thanks in large part to Manny Machado, who, after his behavior in the series back in Baltimore, is apparently Public Enemy No. 1 in Oakland. Fans booed him every time he did anything, with many holding signs, some of which, as Gary Thorne suggested on the MASN broadcast, were not fit to be shown on television. Machado responded to all of the boos the best way that you can. He broke a 2-2 tie in the seventh inning by hitting a two run home run off the much-heralded Jeff Samardzija. That was the second two-run homer that Samardzija had allowed in the game, with Jonathan Schoop also hitting one in the fifth inning. Welcome to the real baseball league, Jeff.    The O's touched up Samardzija for four runs in seven innings. They did very little against him the first time around, but they adjusted the next time around, or at least the bottom of the lineup did. The 2-4 hitters were hitless on the night, and #5 hitter Chris Davis only had an excuse-me swing that turned into an opposite field base hit.    O's starter Chris Tillman may not have had the better stuff, but he got the better results. Over 6.2 innings, Tillman gave up only four hits and a walk, striking out six. He allowed two runs, one of which came on a solo home run from Derek Norris in the fifth inning of the game. Norris looks like he belongs on the Red Sox. That was the second Oakland run, with the first coming when John Jaso doubled in Coco Crisp to score the game's first run in the third inning. It was a great one, and then suddenly it wasn't. Baseball is wonderful and cruel, sometimes both on the same night. Britton had not allowed a run in his last ten appearances. He was due, you might say. Even with three earned runs allowed while not retiring a batter, he has a 1.86 ERA on the year.    That's little comfort for the Orioles or fans tonight. Damn. Just, damn. Worth keeping an eye on will be the health of Nelson Cruz. He fouled a ball off of the top of his foot and was ginger in his attempts to trot down to first base in every at-bat after that. Hopefully that's the kind of thing that will be okay the next day, or at least in a day or two. J.J. Hardy had a 2-3 night and scored two of the Orioles runs. Tommy Hunter pitched four outs of scoreless relief. These performances meant nothing in the game's final outcome, but they did their jobs tonight. If only everyone else could say the same.    The good/bad thing about a game like this is when you get to pick up and do it all again tomorrow. There is no time for wallowing or pity. The season rolls on. Saturday's game has a 9:05 start time.

Nelson Cruz hits a home run every 13 at-bats, and two other Oriole players hit a home run in fewer than 20-plate appearances.The Orioles hold a 44-23 record when they hit a home run in a game, which is an impressive 21 games above .500.The Orioles have hit 119 home runs. Nick Markakis has fewer hits (118) than the Orioles have home runs.The Toronto Blue Jays have hit 119 home runs in 99 games.

With the consistency in hitting home runs, this does not seem like a problem, but as the season progresses, this will become a problem for the Orioles.They have to begin to score runs without the home run. Once August comes around, the hot days are going to make for tired players, and tired players do not hit consistent home runs.Some may believe that pitching is needed for a postseason push, but the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching follows the offense. If the offense does well, the pitching often follows up with a good outing.The teams the Orioles have to compete against have strong pitching, not allowing \xc2\xa0as many\xc2\xa0home runs. So the Orioles have to begin to draw more on small ball, or other extra base hit combinations.The Orioles now head to Anaheim to face the Angels, who have the second-best pitching staff when it comes to allowing home runs. And separated by only three home runs allowed, the Seattle Mariners sit at eighth in the American League in home runs allowed.\xe2\x80\x9dThere is no other option for the players, because scoring runs almost solely by the home run will not cut it in a playoff push\xe2\x80\x9dThere really is no other, because scoring runs almost solely by the home run will not cut it in a playoff push. There has to be a combination of small ball and home runs.If the Orioles can do this, they will become even more dangerous on the offensive side of the ball.Home runs are impressive and a great asset, but if the Orioles can score runs through a high OBP and hit well in RISP situations, the opposing pitchers will\xc2\xa0build their pitch counts more rapidly.The more pressure the Orioles can put on the opposing pitchers the better they will play. The quicker the opponents\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen\xc2\xa0has to come into the game will only lead to bigger innings\xc2\xa0for the Orioles. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles answer the call - birdswatcher.com', 'Whenever I see a team lose a lead and thus a game (in walk off fashion) as the Baltimore Orioles did in Oakland Friday night, I\xe2\x80\x9dm instantly reminded of the 2007\xc2\xa0Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day Massacre in Boston. Granted, the O\xe2\x80\x99s managed to blow a 5-1 lead that day in the last of the ninth inning which is much different than what we saw Friday, however it was still a dramatic loss that probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened. Not that things were going that great prior to that day, however I\xe2\x80\x99ve always felt as if that game really set the tone for the struggles that the Birds ended up having that year.Every team in baseball is going to lose games in walk off fashion. When it happens that team is challenged to put it out of their minds so that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t turn into another loss, another after that, and so forth. The best way to avoid something like that snowballing is to win your next game out. Last night, the Baltimore Orioles answered that call as they defeated Oakland 8-4. Wei-Yin Chen only made it through five innings, and while I suspect he still had something left Buck Showalter wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to run that risk. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, \xc2\xa0H, 3 R, 1 BB, 4 K. Chen produced several long fly ball outs which might have been interesting at Camden Yards, but in a park like Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s ended up in outfielders\xe2\x80\x99 mitts.The Baltimore Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t wasting any time in\xc2\xa0answering the call\xc2\xa0last night; they started right up from the get go. Nick Markakis led off with a single in the first, which was followed by a Steve Pearce walk. That brought Adam Jones to the plate, and he promptly gave the BirdsCourtesy of Bob Stanton-USA TODAY Sportsa 3-0 lead with a home run to left field. Later with two outs in the inning, J.J. Hardy added a solo shot and after a half inning the O\xe2\x80\x99s led 4-0.Chris Davis would add an RBI-double in the third, and suddenly the O\xe2\x80\x99s had chased their former teammate Jason Hammel from the game. Hammel of course was traded to Oakland from the Chicago Cubs a few weeks ago. However keep in mind that Oakland is a team that believes it\xe2\x80\x99s never out of a game, similar to the Orioles. So for the entire game the O\xe2\x80\x99s were seemingly on edge in hopes that they could record the third out in the ninth inning before Oakland somehow came back \xe2\x80\x93 and with good reason, as Brandon Moss cut the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead to 5-1 with a solo homer in the last of the third.However again, these Orioles truly answered the call last night. In the wake of Oakland thinking they had gained some momentum back, Adam Jones came up with one out and two runners in scoring position in the fourth. In recording his fourth and fifth RBI of the night, Jones sent a two-RBI single to center field and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were on top 7-1. But what did I say above? \xe2\x80\x93 Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s a team who thinks they\xe2\x80\x99re never out of it. Lowrie\xe2\x80\x99s two-RBI double in the last of the inning brought the Oriole lead back to four at 7-3.As I alluded above, Buck Showalter lifted Chen before he could tire out and get himself in any trouble. The short outings are one frustration that the O\xe2\x80\x99s have with Chen, although while he was in the game he was fairly solid. \xc2\xa0But the Orioles also got two incredibly solid innings out of Brad Brach, who gave up one run on another Lowrie RBI (single) in the sixth.One thing we haven\xe2\x80\x99t always seen from these O\xe2\x80\x99s this year is insurance runs, but Chris Davis provided that with a solo home run in the top of the ninth, running the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead to 8-4. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day recorded two outs in the last of the ninth, before things got just a bit interesting. He issued a two-out walk to Brandon Moss before giving up a \xe2\x80\x9cbroken bat dying quail\xe2\x80\x9d single to Stephen Vogt. Sound familiar? When you\xe2\x80\x99re a team like Oakland and you\xe2\x80\x99re at home in front of your fans (who seem to pride themselves in staying loud by way of a Brazian soccer-syle samba party every game), if you get a couple of runners on in the ninth inning you start to believe. However Zach Britton came on to record the final out, which he did by striking out Nick Punto.Again, this is a big win for the Orioles because they managed to get the foul taste of Friday night out of their mouths. When you\xe2\x80\x99re in a pennant race as tough as that in which the Orioles find themselves, you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to drop several games in a row. The entire division won yesterday also, thus the Birds didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose any ground.Kevin Gausman will start the series finale this afternoon for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s Sonny Gray. The Orioles will have to make a roster move at some point after today\xe2\x80\x99s game, probably optioning a reliever to the minors. Bud Norris is scheduled to start tomorrow night in Anaheim, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll need to be recalled in order to do so. Incidentally, the O\xe2\x80\x99s weren\xe2\x80\x99t happy in the least about the three hit batsmen on Friday night; it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go unnoticed that two of the players that were hit (Jones and Hardy) each went yard in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game.

Oakland went 4-2 against the AL East leaders and improved its record against the division to 18-11, best in the league.""We go out and play our style of baseball, and if we\'re able to do that, we feel like we\'re going to win no matter who it is,\'\' said A\'s third baseman Josh Donaldson, who went 4-for-12 with five RBI in the series. ""But any time you get to play a team of their caliber, it\'s always nice to come out on the winning side.\'\'     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Padres\' Despaigne loses no-hitter in the 8thSonny Gray pitched 6 2/3 inning of two-hit ball and the Oakland offense pounded out 15 hits as Oakland maintained a 1\xc2\xbd-game lead on the relentless Los Angeles Angels in the AL West.Gray was masterful in improving to 11-3, holding the Orioles hitless until J.J. Hardy belted an RBI double over center fielder Coco Crisp\'s head in the fifth. The A\'s had staked Gray to a 4-0 lead by that point and he wouldn\'t allow any more liberties until the seventh.His performance \xe2\x80\x93 Gray gave up two runs, one earned, and struck out eight \xe2\x80\x93 stood in stark contrast to his two previous starts against the Orioles, both at Camden Yards, where they tagged him for 11 runs in 8 2/3 innings while beating him both times.""They got me twice there, so I really wanted to get them today, and it was awesome,\'\' Gray said. ""We scored in every inning except for a couple, so that was big. I really wanted to go after these guys with my stuff in front of the fans and hoping to come away with a good outing in here.\'\'That was as close as anybody on the A\'s would come to indicating any special motivation to beat Baltimore.The A\'s also took two out of three when the clubs met at Camden Yards on June 6-8. That weekend was marked by Machado losing his poise and confronting Donaldson after being tagged out on the bases, then two games later flinging his bat toward third base in apparent objection to close pitches. Both incidents prompted the dugouts to clear, and Machado was suspended for five games and apologized.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Reds drop ball in ninth to allow Yankees sweepNo such animosity was displayed in Oakland, even though three Orioles hitters were hit by pitches in Friday\'s game, which the A\'s won 5-4 on Donaldson\'s three-run walk-off homer.While the principals on the field downplayed any lingering resentment, the fans weren\'t as forgiving. Machado was booed loudly and persistently every time he stepped to the plate, and the crowd even expressed its disappointment when he was pinch-hit for in the ninth inning Sunday, denying the fans one more time to jeer him. Machado didn\'t seem affected, going 3-for-11 with a homer and three RBI in the series.""I\'m sure they\'ll have another form of entertainment after we leave,\'\' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.This series marked the beginning of a 10-game trip for the Orioles, who now head to Anaheim to face the Angels and after that will play four against the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field. Oddly, the Orioles\' next 13 games are against those two clubs \xe2\x80\x93 the A\'s closest pursuers \xe2\x80\x93 who will pay return visits to Baltimore next week.The Orioles are 12-8 against the AL West, but Showalter had no desire to assess where his club stands in relation to the A\'s or any other team.""I think we all know where they\'re going to be with their pitching staff,\'\' Showalter said. ""It\'s just a matter of (grinding) through the rest of the season before we can see if we get a chance to roll the dice in September and October.

(AP) \xe2\x80\x94 If the Baltimore Orioles want to contend for the American League pennant, they will likely have to find a way to beat the Oakland Athletics.Sonny Gray struck out eight to win his fifth consecutive decision, and the A\'s pounded the Orioles 10-2 on Sunday in the final regular-season meeting between the AL division leaders.""They are the best team in baseball right now,"" Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy said. ""And we\'re right there with them.""Maybe. Just not yet.The A\'s (61-37) overpowered the AL East-leading Orioles (53-44) to take two of three at the Coliseum and finish 4-2 against Baltimore this year.Hardy\'s RBI double in the fifth was the Orioles\' first hit \xe2\x80\x94 and one of just three in the game. Oakland had 15 hits and chased starter Kevin Gausman (4-3) in the fifth before beating up Baltimore\'s bullpen the rest of the way.""We\'re all ready to get back into a routine for the rest of the season,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""It\'s a matter of sticking around and seeing if we can get a chance to roll the dice in September and October.""Gray (11-3) gave up two runs, one earned, two hits and two walks in 6 2-3 innings. The 24-year-old right-hander hasn\'t lost since June 13 at the New York Yankees.Oakland\'s offense started fast and got contributions from all over.Stephen Vogt had three hits and drove in a run. John Jaso, who tripled, singled and had two RBIs. Josh Donaldson had two singles and two RBIs. Craig Gentry singled twice and had two RBIs.Eric Sogard singled twice and drove in a run after starting the day in a 4-for-35 slump. Two-time reigning Home Run Derby champion Yoenis Cespedes singled and doubled for his first extra-base hit since June 25.""They pick their spots to ambush. They took a lot of good pitches,"" said Gausman, who gave up five runs and nine hits in four-plus innings.He didn\'t get much relief, either. T.J.

Jaso crossed the plate after a wild pitch by Gausman to give the A\'s a 2-0 lead.Oakland added another run on a weird blunder by Baltimore in the third, when center fielder Adam Jones \xe2\x80\x94 and several Orioles players \xe2\x80\x94 started trotting to the dugout after he caught Donaldson\'s fly for the second out. Cespedes jogged home from third, and Jones stopped and dropped his shoulders after realizing his mistake.Donaldson said he even questioned whether the scoreboard was correct when Jones began his trot to the dugout. Both managers said they were surprised, too.No matter.Jaso singled to drive in another run in the fourth that extended Oakland\'s lead to 4-0. The A\'s added three runs in the fifth, getting help on a throwing error by Machado \xe2\x80\x94 who continued to get booed for his bat-throwing incident against Oakland in Baltimore last month \xe2\x80\x94 at third base, and scored three more in the sixth.Eric O\'Flaherty tossed 1 1-3 scoreless innings, and Sean Doolittle pitched a perfect ninth as the A\'s closed out the Orioles.NOTES: Orioles RHP Ubaldo Jimenez, on the disabled list with a sprained right ankle, threw a bullpen session and will continue to work his way back before making a rehab start in the minors. ...

07/21/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: No Need to Panic', 'Jul 20, 2014; Oakland, CA, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Kevin Gausman (39) throws a pitch against the Oakland Athletics during the first inning at O.co Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Ed Szczepanski-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles dropped a Sunday game to the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s 10-2, losing the weekend series 2-1 and the season series 4-2. They also lost a game in the standings to everyone else in the AL East. Over the weekend, the AL East was 12-3, with the other four teams 11-1. The O\xe2\x80\x99s now head south to Los Angeles to play another team almost as good as the A\xe2\x80\x99s.Is it time to panic?No, not yet. The Orioles still maintain a three-game lead over the Jays and Yankees. But at the end of the day (and hopefully at the end of the regular season), this Orioles lineup is as good as any in the AL East. And even without pitching staff modifications, this staff can compete in this injury-riddled division. I know there are alternate opinions out there \xe2\x80\x93 beliefs that the O\xe2\x80\x99s and Dan Duquette need to make a dramatic move to compete and win. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two words for you if you think an acquisition or trade is sure to make a difference \xe2\x80\x93 Ubaldo Jimenez Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s an opinion, this is an opinion \xe2\x80\xa6 and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two words for you if you think an acquisition or trade is sure to make a difference \xe2\x80\x93 Ubaldo Jimenez.Regarding the weekend series with the A\xe2\x80\x99s:\xc2\xa0 This is a good team. I really can say I enjoyed watching these games and this Oakland team. They make the most of opportunities. And honestly, the Orioles should have come out of the weekend with a 2-1 record. And though the A\xe2\x80\x99s have twice blown out the Orioles this year, just a couple differences in the other two losses would have and should have made them Baltimore wins.The Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s are not categorically better than the Orioles. However, they sure looked like they are on Sunday. The yellow and green guys hit anything thrown over the heart of the plate\xe2\x80\x94tallying 15 hits to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 three and taking the game 10-2.I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to write about it in any detail, and you probably don\xe2\x80\x99t want to read any more about Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game. In summary, Kevin Gausman was not sharp, and he did not get away with any mistakes at all. His opponent Sonny Gray had excellent stuff\xe2\x80\x94as he has had in recent outings, hence having now an 11-3 record\xe2\x80\x94and there was little the Orioles could do to get to him. It was a great day for the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s, but again, it only counts as one win.There is little relief going down the coast to open a three-game set with the Angels. The Angels\xe2\x80\x99 34-16 record at home is the best in MLB. Los Angeles won two-of-three over the Mariners this past weekend, and they have won 12 of their last 14 games. You know the old saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just who you play, but when you play them?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Yep. The Yankees are 4-2 against the Angels, while the Jays are 4-3. Most of those games were played when the Angels were struggling to break above .500 earlier in the season. If it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for bad luck, the Orioles would have no luck at all.Bud Norris will make the start for the Orioles, as he continues to look to come back from his time on the DL. He is currently 7-6 with a 3.96 ERA.Of the big guns of the Angels against Norris: Albert Pujols is 7-for-36 with 3 doubles (.194), Mike Trout is 5-for-12 with 3 doubles, David Freese is 7-for-18 with 2 doubles, and Josh Hamilton is 4-for-12 with a double and homer.Also Chris Iannetta is 2-for-7, Erick Aybar is 2-for-9, and Howie Kendrick is 1-for-11.The Orioles will be facing yet another good rookie pitcher in Matt Shoemaker who is 7-2 with a 4.38 ERA.\xc2\xa0 Though he is a rookie, he is approaching age 28.

I must make a confession: after I pointed out that he'd managed at least five innings in every start this year, he lasted for only four innings in that last start. Mea culpa. Shoemaker made his major league debut last year, a five-inning scoreless start, before starting this season in the Angels' bullpen. After making a few relief appearances, he was sent to the minors for a month to get stretched back out, and has mostly been a starter since then. Shoemaker has five pitches: four-seam fastball, sinker, slider, curve, and splitter. Righties see more four-seamers than lefties, but both see fastballs roughly half of the time. Shoemaker's splitter is his main out pitch against both righties and lefties, but as a changeup-like offering, he uses it more often against lefties when not ahead in the count. He'll throw righties sliders in any count and occasionally drop in a show-me curveball. Maybe hot: David Freese (.950 OPS, 20 PA) Likely not: Albert Pujols (.570 OPS, 41 PA) Tuesday, July 22, 10:05 ET: Miguel Gonzalez @ Hector Santiago      Gonzalez Santiago   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 171.1 89.0 149.0 66.2   ERA 3.78 4.04 3.56 4.32   FIP 4.45 5.24 4.44 4.04   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .243/.300/.413 .279/.349/.483 .243/.343/.396 .243/.316/.369         Gonzalez had a pair of eight-inning stints against the Yankees and Red Sox before, like Norris, getting a brief stay in the minors during the All-Star Break. Given that he failed to go six innings in each of his prior three starts, hopefully this is a sign that he's turning things around. Gonzalez has particularly struggled with the long ball this year, surrendering 16 home runs in his 89 innings, or roughly one every 5.5 IP. It's hard to be successful when you give up that many, but whether that rate is poor luck or a new normal, we won't know for some time yet.    Santiago was sent from the White Sox to the Angels in a three-team trade last offseason. While none of his peripherals are outstanding, and his ERA has risen compared to last season, he's slightly increased his strikeout rate and significantly cut his walk rate since leaving Chicago. Santiago is a fastball guy first and foremost, throwing four-seamers 60% of the time or more. Against lefties, his main offspeed offering is a curveball, while against righties, it's a changeup. Brooks Baseball shows him also having a sinker, cutter, and even screwball, but using them very sparingly. Wednesday, July 23, 10:05 ET: Chris Tillman @ Jered Weaver      Tillman Weaver   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 206.1 125.0 154.1 131.1   ERA 3.71 4.03 3.27 3.43   FIP 4.42 4.46 3.82 4.12   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .241/.303/.427 .248/.320/.392 .237/.289/.382 .229/.290/.369         Tillman pitched well in a tough loss on Friday, giving up two runs over 6.2 IP and striking out six while only allowing four hits and one walk. While his season strikeout rate still looks bad, it appears he's gone back to getting K's, rather than having that pitch-to-contact stretch through May and June finally come back to bite him. Weaver's having another solid season for Anaheim, even if his peripherals don't look quite as good as usual, as his walk rate (7.1%) is higher than it's been since 2009 (2010-2013: 5.8%-6.1% each year). He takes a very different approach depending on batter handedness. Against fellow righties, he throws around 40% four-seam fastballs, 10% sinkers, and an even mix of his three offspeed pitches (slider, curve, and changeup). Versus lefties, the four-seamer and sinker swap roles, and the slider nearly disappears, with the curve and change each being thrown a bit more often.

07/22/2014,"[('Get to know your Orioles: Chris Davis - Camden Chat', ' The 2014 season has been one of disappointment for the Orioles first baseman. He has struggled with inconsistency and injury. His average has dipped below .200 several times this season and fans have called for him to be moved even farther down the order. Through all of this, he is still one of the great power threats in all of baseball and not someone easy to bet against improving in the second half.

It is\xc2\xa0his humor. Whether it is\xc2\xa0goofing around during a preseason photo shoot, or\xc2\xa0high-fiving teammates that aren\'t there or his affinity for the man hug; like\xc2\xa0this and\xc2\xa0this.\xc2\xa0It is something that, his mother says, he has been doing his entire life. Chris is the son of Lyn and Karen and the little brother of Jennifer. When he was young, Chris would perform Will Ferrell skits from Saturday Night Live for his family. In high school he would regularly wear fuzzy, pink slippers to school, just because.    Davis comes from humble enough beginnings. His father works at a furniture store and his mother is an adjuster for Farmer\'s Insurance. The couple divorced when Chris was in high school.    It is also of note that the man they call ""Crush"" today was always destined to become the behemoth he is. He weighed in at 9 lbs as a newborn. And in middle school he would squeeze tennis balls to build his forearms. A funny story that his mother\xc2\xa0shared with ESPN last year was that when Chris was 11 years old he broke his ankle rollerblading. He had recovered just in time for Little League season. In the first game, without weeks to prepare like the other kids, he smacked a game-winning home run.    At Longview High School in Texas, Chris was both the starting shortstop and the ace of the Lobo\'s staff. He was bringing 94 mph cheddar on the mound and was maybe only a few pounds lighter then as he is now. He earned the nickname ""Biscuit"" from his varsity coach because he had told Davis that he was ""one biscuit away from outgrowing shortstop."" It wouldn\'t be his frame but his arm that actually moved him from the position as he suffered an injury his senior year. Despite the arm injury he still put up massive numbers, breaking Longview\'s school record by hitting 13 home runs in 30 games. It was enough for big league scouts to take notice. The New York Yankees selected him with the third to last selection of the 2004 draft. He would decline and attend the University of Texas on a baseball scholarship. However, things didn\'t go well at Texas. He was there during the fall of 2004. He worked out and practiced with the Longhorns, but he didn\'t see himself getting any playing time. Then, the decision was made to transfer to Navarro College, a community college two hours away from his high school.    At Navarro his reputation grew; the Angels selected him in the 35th round of the 2005 draft. He spurned the pros again in favor of his final year in junior college. Then, in 2006 he was named a pre-season JUCO All-American by Baseball America, hit 18 home runs for the Bulldogs and was chosen by his hometown Texas Rangers in the 5th round. After this, he tore through the minors in two seasons and made his debut at the age of 22. He played well, hitting .285 in 80 games and looked every bit like the next big thing in Texas. They like big things down there. But things were not meant to be. He struggled to keep his spot on the Rangers club. He would be shuttled between Texas and Triple-A for each of the next three seasons. His average in a major league uniform had taken a dip, his home runs were non-existent, and his strikeouts were astronomical. In 2010, Davis hit .192 in 45 games for Texas with one home run, 15 walks and 40 strikeouts. The Rangers were losing patience. It was at this time that Davis decided to take a look at his life. He was struggling professionally, but he believed that it had to do with things off the field. He didn\'t consider himself an alcoholic but he would drink, a lot. He recently told Baltimore Magazine that he had gotten into the routine of heading to the ballpark, playing the game, going straight to the bar afterwards and going to bed. It was the same thing every single day and he attacked it in the same manner he does many things in his life; full bore. He drank and drank hard.    Davis seeked the guidance of a well documented recovering addict and teammate, Josh Hamilton. The two are each very religious and would have long discussions on their lives. Hamilton helped the first baseman realize that baseball is not a guarantee, He needed to have his mind right if he were to reach his ultimate potential. As a result, Davis got out of the bar and stayed in the gym. He was also lucky enough to meet his future wife, Jill Meyer, at this time. They first met one another at a Tex-Mex restaurant in 2010. They began dating, and when Davis was assigned to the Domincan Republic for off-season training Jill came with him and stayed for an entire month. After a year of wooing, Davis proposed to Jill on the beach in Maui while the two enjoyed a candlelit dinner together. They were married in 2012 and just had their first child, Ella, in May. Jill was a support system for Chris is that final year in Texas. He had grown worried about his future in baseball. His struggles to stay in the majors were well known; fodder for radio shows in the area. He thought about going back to school to become a minister or youth pastor. She explained that it was his decision and she would support it no matter what. The next day, he hit three home runs for Triple-A Round Rock. Baseball it was. In 2011, Oriole fans are very familiar with a trade that helped shape the magical season of 2012. On July 30, Davis, along with Tommy Hunter, was sent to Baltimore in exchange for middle relief pitcher Koji Uehara. It was one of the final moves by Andy MacPhail that set the Orioles up for success.    You know the rest of this story. Since then, Davis has set the Orioles franchise record for home runs in a season, become a clubhouse morale booster and the object of affection for male and female fans alike. Not bad for such a goofball.

On Tuesday, the O\'s bumped up another pair of players from Frederick to Bowie, according to MASN\'s Steve Melewski:     The Orioles are moving OFs Glynn Davis and Michael Burgess from Frederick to AA Bowie. Davis/Burgess expected to play 4 Baysox tonight.\r \xe2\x80\x94 Steve Melewski (@masnSteve) July 22, 2014     Though Burgess was batting .315/.366/.579 at Frederick, it\'s probably not worth getting too excited about him because he is a 25-year-old who was playing in High-A ball. The 5\'11"" lefty was drafted in the first round by the Nationals all the way back in 2007 and will now be hitting Double-A for the fourth time. Better luck this time, Michael. Glynn Davis is a much more interesting name since he actually has some prospect juice. He also has a great origin story, in that he was playing baseball for CCBC-Catonsville, went undrafted, because honestly, why would anyone bother to scout CCBC-Catonsville? The Orioles area scout offered him $100,000 to play pro ball, mostly on the strength of his speed. Everyone loves a local kid, and it\'s great if the Orioles could find a player hidden right in their own back yard.       The right-handed Davis, 22, had been in his second full season at High-A, still on the young side for the level. So far this season, he\'s batted .295/.363/.386, by far his best OPS in professional baseball. What he has shown this year that he hasn\'t before is the ability to hit for average, as well as doubles power, already hitting 21 in 89 games. Last season and the year before he had only 17 doubles in 97 and 123 games, respectively. He\'s also stolen 20 bases so far this year, though he\'s been caught stealing eight times. Burgess and Davis will join the recently-promoted Mike Yastrzemski in the Bowie outfield. Are either one of them going to be up to the challenge? If so, that would be great news for the Orioles. Double-A isn\'t so far from the majors when you get down to it.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Jones Powers Orioles Over Shoemaker, Angels 4-2 \\xab CBS ...', ' ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Two misplaced pitches to Adam Jones cost Los Angeles Angels rookie Matt Shoemaker in an otherwise dominant outing against the Baltimore Orioles. Jones hit a pair of two-run homers, including a tiebreaking shot in the sixth inning, and the AL East leaders beat the Angels 4-2 Monday night. Shoemaker (7-3) gave up four runs and five hits in 5 2-3 innings, striking out 10 and walking none. The loss left Los Angeles two games behind first-place Oakland in the AL West. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tough loss for Matt. I thought he threw the ball extremely well,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Mike Scioscia said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor not having pitched in 14 days, to be able to get to that point in the game was great.\xe2\x80\x9d Jones, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it past the second round in last week\xe2\x80\x99s All-Star Home Run Derby, opened the scoring in the first with a drive into the left-field bullpen after a single by Nick Markakis. Shoemaker retired his next 15 batters \xe2\x80\x94 striking out eight \xe2\x80\x94 before Markakis doubled with one out in the sixth. One out later, Jones hit his 19th homer to left-center for a 4-2 lead. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first at-bat, just got behind in the count,\xe2\x80\x9d Shoemaker said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was 2-0 and I came back with a fastball \xe2\x80\x94 obviously a pretty bad fastball. It was up, and he hit it out. Next at-bat it was a slider that backed up and ended up fairly down, but in the middle of the plate.\xe2\x80\x9d Jones\xe2\x80\x99 multihomer game was the fifth of his career. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about him, but that\xe2\x80\x99s what scouting reports are for,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had an idea of what he throws, but nobody had seen him. So when you go up there, the best way to figure things out is trial and error. I swing. I\xe2\x80\x99m hacking. Sometimes you run into them. He gave up two home runs, but overall, his plan worked. He had a lot of strikeouts.\xe2\x80\x9d The Angels tied it 2-all in the fourth when Howie Kendrick led off with a ground-rule double and scored on Hank Conger\xe2\x80\x99s sharp single to right. A two-out infield hit by Kole Calhoun loaded the bases for All-Star game MVP Mike Trout, who took a called third strike and immediately got into umpire Eric Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s face \xe2\x80\x94 but didn\xe2\x80\x99t get ejected. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a big pitch in the game,\xe2\x80\x9d Trout said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe count could have gone to 3-2, so you never know what could have happened. I thought it was a ball. It looked outside, but what are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d Trout was called out on strikes again his next time up and had more to say to Cooper before Scioscia came out to make sure his power-hitting center fielder stayed in the game. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a wide zone for both clubs, I think, and you have to live with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Scioscia said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s part of what we talk about. You have to absorb the pitch you don\xe2\x80\x99t get or the pitch that\xe2\x80\x99s called against you.\xe2\x80\x9d Bud Norris (8-6) won for the fifth time in his last six starts, allowing two runs \xe2\x80\x94 one earned \xe2\x80\x94 and eight hits over 6 2-3 innings with eight strikeouts and two walks. The Orioles increased their AL East lead to four games over the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays. Norris was recalled from Double-A Bowie, where he was optioned on July 10 in order to keep him on his regular routine during the All-Star break. The Orioles did the same thing with Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled starter, Miguel Gonzalez, who was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk on July 11. Zach Britton pitched a perfect ninth for his 17th save. Setup man Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, who began his big league career with the Angels in 2008, pitched a perfect eighth to lower his ERA to 1.04 \xe2\x80\x94 the best among AL relievers. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always had an affinity for him from afar, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve always hoped I could have him on a club,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. NOTES: Albert Pujols flied out on a 3-0 pitch in the fifth. The three-time NL MVP is batting .432 in his career on 3-0 counts (32 for 74) with six homers and 22 RBIs. \xe2\x80\xa6 The Angels, who came in leading the majors in runs, didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a hit after Josh Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s one-out single in the fifth.

LOUIS -- David Price arrived into town Sunday night, walked across the street, caught the St. Louis Cardinals\' game, drank a couple of beers, and had a nice, leisurely lunch the next day.And never had to pay for a thing.Price, who arrived in the seventh inning with 10 of his buddies, was even offered a suite. He politely declined, and plopped in the third row of the second deck, right in Big Mac Land, cheering like any other fan at Busch Stadium.It was that way everywhere he went these past two days. Folks welcomed him to town. And then begged him to stay.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Can Chase Headley help Yankees in a weak AL East?Price is scheduled to leave town on a chartered plane Wednesday night with the rest of his Tampa Bay Rays teammates, but Cardinals fans are making sure to let him know he\'s welcome to stay a while longer.Like, for the next 1 \xc2\xbd years, if not the rest of his working career.""The people here have been great,\'\' said Price, the Rays ace who lives about a five-hour drive away in Nashville. ""They\'re awesome. I couldn\'t have been treated any nicer.\'\'The St. Louis Cardinals are doing everything but bring room service to Price during his stay.OK, well maybe not the Cardinals themselves, but they\'re letting their fans and stadium workers handle the sales pitch.The Cardinals want Price. They need Price. And if he happens to be traded to the Cardinals, and is willing to sign a long-term contract, well, they\'d be happy to name an Italian restaurant on The Hill in his honor.Yes, Price is that big, that important, and is the only player on the trade market who can make the difference between a contender and a World Series championship.If the Rays decide to trade Price, and that decision hinges on how they fare in the next week, he\'s likely going to the Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers or Seattle Mariners.Yet, one-high ranking American League club executive predicts that if the Rays trade Price, one team stands out from the rest.Yes, St. Louis.Price, 28, certainly has his preferences if he\'s forced to leave Tampa, but reminds you that he has no say. He has no trade provisions in his contract. His only leverage is that he can decide whether to negotiate a long-term contract once he\'s traded, or wait until free agency after the 2015 season.The Cardinals would prefer to take their chances right now. They\'ve got the prized pieces to at least entice the Rays. You want prized outfielder Oscar Taveras? You got him. Starting pitcher Shelby Miller? Done. More prospects? Go ahead and name them.""Who wouldn\'t want him?\'\' Dodgers starter Dan Haren says. ""He would be would be nice for anyone to have. Any team that gets him would be lucky to have him.""When you are the most dominant pitcher in the American League these days, the contender that acquires Price may as well start planning that parade route, because a World Series could be coming your way.Let\'s see, the dude is 4-0 with a 0.87 ERA in July, and has won five consecutive starts. He has pitched at least eight innings in eight of his last 11 starts. He hasn\'t given up a run in his last 16 innings. And, oh yeah, he has struck out a major-league leading 173 hitters.""I\'ve never seen him pitch any better,\'\' says Rays catcher Jose Molina, 39, who the Cardinals also would love to acquire until his younger brother, Yadier, returns from his torn thumb ligament. ""He\'s doing everything he wants to on the mound. He\'s in complete control.\'\'Well, except of his own fate.The Rays, who had baseball\'s worst record just five weeks ago, suddenly are playing better than anyone in the major leagues, winning 23 of their last 34 games, and climbing to within eight games of the Baltimore Orioles.Considering the mediocrity in the AL East, the Rays might be stupid to give up, knowing they can actually win this thing.""Are we trying to win here? What we going to do?\'\' Rays veteran reliever Grant Balfour said. ""If you want to give us a chance to win, we keep him. This is a six-month season. Why would you want to give up after four months?\'\'Yet these are the Rays. They play in a dump. They can\'t draw fans. And they can\'t afford to keep their own star players.They may be able to keep Price now, but certainly not after this winter, when his salary is expected to hit $20 million in salary arbitration.If the Rays\' front office doesn\'t believe they can win now, why not shop Price, and see if they\'re tempted to move him?""You don\'t want to see guys get traded, but you understand why,\'\' Rays starter Alex Cobb says. ""I\'ve seen how the organization has been run since I\'ve been here, seen the way they operated. So I would absolutely understand it.""I\'m not going to say I wouldn\'t be upset for a while, but in the long run, I know they would do what they think is the best fit for us.\'\'The Rays are careful not to broach the subject with Price. Price certainly doesn\'t want to hear it. He tries to stay away from the rumors. The only time he knows his name is floated to a team is if a new fan base is suddenly joining his 221,000-strong Twitter following.""I don\'t want to let anyone with my situation affect how I am in the clubhouse and on the field,\'\' Price said. ""If I let it affect me, then it\'ll definitely affect the team, and affect my teammates. I don\'t want to be a distraction.\'\'Price, who last attended a game as a fan was when he was about 14, watching Mark McGwire launch home run balls at old Busch Stadium, realizes he has to be careful, too. He talked last week about how cool it would be to part of a Chicago Cubs team that won their first World Series since 1908.The next thing he knew, folks thought he was campaigning to join them.""I still stand behind that,\'\' Price said. ""I think everybody in baseball would say that if you won a championship in Chicago, you would have statues. You would have restaurants. People would name their kids after you. That\'s a part of history. Everybody wants to be part of history. \xe2\x80\xa6""It doesn\'t mean that I want to play there.\'\'Then again, there are plenty of statues in front of Busch Stadium, and restaurants owned by Cardinals players and broadcasters, that make winning in St. Louis pretty cool, too.""I did get a free meal (Monday),\'\' Price said.

07/23/2014,"[('The Baltimore Orioles Fan Base is a Win-Sensitive One', 'Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAccording to a recent study, Baltimore Orioles fans are the second-most win sensitive fans in all of baseball. In other words, Baltimore has the second-worst tolerance for their team losing in the MLB. This can be seen on Orioles fan pages and chat rooms after a game.If the Orioles win a game, everyone is fairly happy with the exception of a few \xe2\x80\x9cnit-pickers\xe2\x80\x9d out there. Yet, if the Orioles drop one game, fans come out in large numbers saying how Showalter does not know how to manage a ball club, they should trade for an ace, and how mediocre the team is (even though the Orioles are in first place by four games).I will be honest here. I, myself, contribute to this study that called\xc2\xa0the Orioles fan base a win-sensitive one. When Miguel Gonzalez struggled early on this season, I remember loathing him and wishing the Orioles would send him down to the Minors or just trade him away. And after his past three outings, Gonzalez has become my favorite pitcher in the Orioles rotation.Although I believe this study adequately describes Orioles fans as a whole, I have to ask the people who were in charge of collecting the data, \xe2\x80\x9cCan you blame us?\xe2\x80\x9dUntil the Buckle Up Birds in 2012, Orioles fans were forced\xc2\xa0to watch 14 consecutive years of losing baseball. They (rather, we) had to suffer through watching players like Larry Bigbie, Brook Fordyce, and\xc2\xa0Luis Matos struggle at the plate and pitchers like Buddy Groom, Mike DeJean and Jorge Julio lose countless games for the Orioles coming out of the bullpen. All of these players were being managed by the likes of Mike Hargrove, Lee Mazzilli, and Dave Trembley\xc2\xa0who all made fans pull their hair out.In those years of losing, it seemed like a pattern arose after awhile. The season would start off with manager and players both saying they have a good ball club and fans should look out for them. This always got the fans\xe2\x80\x99 hopes up as did the beginning of the season when the Orioles would start off great and everyone thought the same thing: \xe2\x80\x9cHey maybe this will be our year.\xe2\x80\x9dUnfortunately, this just led to heartbreak year after year when the team could not sustain their winning habits and slip far away from playoff contention and out of relevance in the MLB.Then in November of 2011, a new Executive-Vice President for Players Operations came into town by the name of Dan Duquette. He said he wanted to bring a championship team back to Baltimore and at that point all of Baltimore probably rolled their eyes acknowledging that it was the same story, different day.Yet, this time, Baltimore was not let down but rather they were picked up by the team in 2012 and carried into the Postseason for the first time since 1997. And after back-to-back winning seasons in the books, it is safe to say Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette have gotten Baltimore excited about baseball again.This third season with the Duquette and Showalter duo is proving to be their best one yet. The Orioles are currently 55-44 sitting atop the American League East with a four game lead on the Yankees and Blue Jays. Even with the struggling Chris Davis and Matt Wieters having to sit out the rest of the year after having Tommy John Surgery, the Orioles continue to defy the odds and win baseball games.Why are there \xe2\x80\x9cbipolar\xe2\x80\x9d fans still in Baltimore if the team is so good you ask? I think it is because, since this city has not seen winning baseball in so long, now that they have it they do not believe it, including myself.There is a part of me and a part of all Orioles fans that worry this team will slip back into their losing ways after blowing a save or losing a couple of games in a row. This winning thing seems too good to be true. It may be something that can be fixed with an American League East Division Title.Until that comes into fruition\xe2\x80\xa6 Stay Hungry Baltimore!

07/24/2014,"[('Extending Chris Davis and Matt Wieters having Down Seasons', "" Continuing with the theme of extension begun by Ryan\xc2\xa0earlier this week, the Orioles have two other interesting extension candidates who will become free agents after the 2015 season. Before this season, an extension with either player is likely to command at least 100 million of commitment. This is not the case anymore. Both have suffered lost seasons, one due to significantly worse performance and one due to a season-ending Tommy John surgery. Of course, I am talking about Chris Davis and Matt Wieters. While we should understandably lament their lack of impact on the O's current playoff hopes, their down season and injury provide a window for the O's to extend them at a discount.    For very obvious reasons, few players have signed extensions amid or after a down season or a significant injury. Players are unwilling to sign extensions when their perceived values are at the lowest. Teams, subject to recency bias, would not extend players whose current production suggests players unworthy of future investment. \xc2\xa0In fact, I cannot find a single player who was extended after losing more than half a season due to injury since 2008 according to MLBTradeRumors' extension tracker. And the only players extended after or in the midst of a season with a wRC+ lower than 100 were catchers, shortstops, Chris Young and Jose Altuve. Chris Young was a top prospect and a centerfielder. Altuve was extended for four years at 12.5 million with two options in July 2013. Already, this seems like a great bargain as Altuve has followed his 85 wRC+ in 2013 with a 129 wRC+ so far in 2014. Neither Davis nor Wieters is going to be extended for 12.5 million, but a similar discount is certainly possible. Both Davis and Wieters are represented by Scott Boras, famous for not signing extensions before reaching free agency. This is not always the case, as Boras signed an extension for Jered Weaver with the Angels in 2011 and Elvis Andrus with the Rangers in 2013. Davis and Wieters are entering their final year of arbitration after this season. Both are unlikely to receive a significant raise over their salaries this year. Wieters is in line for about $8 million next season and Davis about $12 million. Where would you draw the line on the number of years and AAV for Wieters and Davis? Miguel Montero's extension seems like a close match to Wieters's situation. Montero signed a five-year $60 million extension in May 2012, his last season under team control. Montero was a similar batter to Wieters in terms of overall production but with less defensive value. There has been an exponential growth in payroll since then, and the O's would definitely extend the same offer had Wieters been healthy. However, Montero did not have a major surgery before his extension, and despite the success rate of Tommy John surgery today, there is always risk involved. I think the higher amount of risk involved is cancelled out by the overflow of cash in baseball. I would not, however, give an extension of five years to Wieters. It is questionable how Wieters would recover from Tommy John surgery, and going above three years in addition to his last year of arbitration would be a steep price to pay. The reduction in length has to be balanced out by a raise in AAV for it to make sense for Wieters. Would a contract of three years at $15 million a year do the trick? That would make it an extension of four years of $53 million with the last year of arbitration included. I am almost certain that Boras would not accept the terms. Maybe raise the total guaranteed amount to $60 million and add a team option for the fifth year? Would Boras bite the bullet?    It is much more difficult to find a comparison for Davis, as he has only one outstanding season in his resume. All of the first basemen that have signed extensions at this stage of the career have a much longer history of elite bat, such as Joey Votto and Adrian Gonzalez. Even Freddie Freeman has a longer track record than Davis despite debuting in the majors two years later. Davis is truly unique in this regard. The question becomes your perception of his bat. Is he going to be 2013 Chris Davis, which he almost certainly is not? Or is he going to 2014 Chris Davis, which hopefully he is not? The answer, as always, is most likely somewhere in between. Both ZiPS and Steamer view him as a slightly better hitter than he was in 2012 as of today. That is an above-average first baseman. The market pays about 6 million per win in free agency last offseason. Davis would be worth about 15 million per year in the open market, but the O's should receive a discount as he is not yet a free agent at a point where his perceived value is much lower than that. Would four years for $48 million be enough? That would make the extension total five years and $60 million. Again, that does not seem like a figure Boras would settle for.   When I began this exercise, I thought it would be easy to come up with a contract that satisfies both the player and the team. It is much more difficult than I imagined. It is no wonder players don't sign extensions after a disappointing season or an injury. Teams need to protect against the possibility that the players do not regain their performance or recover from their injuries, while players generally view themselves at their peak abilities. It is one thing for someone like Altuve who has earned less than a million in the majors to sign an extension that guaranteed him at least $10 million when the clubs do not value him that highly. Both Davis and Wieters have collected close to $15 million in career earnings, and they have less of an incentive to take a discount to ensure their careers do not end in a flash. While this kind of extension can certainly look bad in retrospect, the O's should not always wait for a player to break out before extending them a la Adam Jones. Sometimes it might just be worth it to extend players having down seasons.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles Minor League Rundown: 7/23; Christian Walker ...', "" Triple-A: Norfolk 3, Toledo (DET) 2 Steve Johnson started the game, the latest step in his journey back from a shoulder injury. He was on a light pitch count and only went two innings, giving up a run on one hit and three walks. Sounds like he might have a little bit farther to go. Then again, with that many walks, he'd fit right in on the Orioles staff. Nick Additon pitched five scoreless innings for the win.    Christian Walker hit an RBI double for the Tides. Cord Phelps had a pair of hits. Double-A: Bowie 6, Harrisburg (Walgreens) 4 The recently-promoted Mike Yastrzemski, batting leadoff, went 2-5 with a double and a run scored for the Baysox. He's batting .333/.375/.567 in his seven-game tenure in the Eastern League. It's too much of a small sample size to get excited, but if he keeps it up, that will be cool. Niuman Romero, David Adams, and Garabez Rosa all had multi-hit nights as well. Former shortstop/converted reliever Mychal Givens managed to walk three batters and hit another one in only a third of an inning.    High-A: Frederick 10, Myrtle Beach (TEX) 2 Jason Esposito, the Orioles 2nd round pick in 2011, was the star of the show for the Keys, smashing a pair of home runs as he drove in four runs. They were his fourth and fifth home runs of the season in 89 games. Esposito headed into Wednesday's game with a .642 OPS on the season, which is probably why he's still in Frederick for the second full season.    The Keys starter was Brady Wager, a 9th round pick from 2012, who went six innings and only allowed one run on two hits and a walk. That'll do well indeed, although the outing only lowered his season ERA to 5.58. That's not going to get you to Bowie. Low-A: Rome (ATL) 8, Delmarva 0 The Shorebirds got shut out while only recording three hits for the whole game. The alliteratively-named Matt Marksberry held them to only one hit and two walks across seven innings. Delmarva's Matt Cunningham, making his fourth start for the team, was rocked for seven runs on eleven hits in only 3.2 innings and now sports an 8.68 ERA.    Short-Season: Aberdeen 5, Brooklyn (Mets) 2 2014 4th-rounder Pat Connaughton was robbed of the opportunity to go beyond an inning in the game thanks to a rain delay of about 2:30. He allowed a run on two hits and a walk in his lone inning. Nik Nowottnick did the most work in relief for the Ironbirds, giving up two hits over four scoreless innings. The Ironbirds got three runs in the first inning, helped by Brooklyn committing two errors. Oswill Lartiguez and Austin Anderson each had a pair of hits for Aberdeen. Both of Lartiguez's hits were triples Justin Viele drove in two runs.

07/25/2014,"[('Hall of Fame weekend: Are there any present day Orioles ...', ' Baseball\'s Hall of Fame induction ceremonies are coming up this weekend and, unlike last year, there will be three of the game\'s all-time great players being enshrined in Cooperstown. Orioles fans haven\'t had much reason to get excited about Hall of Fame weekend since Cal Ripken Jr. was inducted in 2007, and until the baseball writers get their heads out of their behinds and appreciate the greatness of Mike Mussina, that will continue to be the case.    After Mussina makes it in, or not, it\'s a bleak picture for O\'s fans wanting to see one of our own make it into Cooperstown. A lost decade will do that to a team. The greatest Oriole of the 00s was, what, Brian Roberts? He played on terrible teams, made two All-Star teams, received MVP votes exactly one time, never won a Gold Glove, and currently has 1,526 hits, just over halfway to that magical 3,000 hit mark in his age 36 season. Maybe if he\'d kept performing at the level he did in 2009 (.283/.356/.451 with 56 doubles) every year beyond that, he might have a chance. That\'s generally not how aging baseball players work, barring some kind of possible chemical enhancement that helps you sustain performance and destroy dugout phones. And anyway, Roberts, whose name showed up in the Mitchell Report, would have all of that PED baggage with voters who won\'t even elect Jeff Bagwell, even if Roberts had the career numbers. He was a great Oriole on some bad Orioles teams, but Cooperstown? Not even close.    One year ago, I posed the question of whether there was a future Hall of Fame player currently on the Orioles. About 82% of readers answered yes in the poll, which is still crazy. As Hall of Fame weekend rolls around again, it\'s time to revisit the landscape and see what it would take for our current Orioles icons to build Hall of Fame cases for themselves.    This post is mostly about whether O\'s players have a chance of reaching certain ""automatic"" benchmarks like 3,000 hits or 500 home runs or 300 wins. It\'s possible that more lenient standards will evolve as the electorate changes and recognizes that things have changed, particularly in the PED testing era. Walks may start to matter more, for instance - not that this would help a member of the Orioles anyway. Nick MarkakisAge: 30MLB seasons: 9 Once, Markakis had the calling card of hitting lots of doubles. When it comes to doubles, 600 is something of a benchmark in the sense that every player who has ever hit 600+ doubles is either in the Hall of Fame or happens to be Pete Rose or Barry Bonds. Only 14 players have ever recorded 600+ doubles in the history of baseball.    Markakis opened up his first full MLB season at age 23 by racking up 43 doubles and 23 home runs. That\'s pretty good, and yet he would have still had to fire off another 14 seasons just like that to get to 600 doubles. That\'s no easy task. Two years later, the home runs tapered off, and two years farther, even the doubles started to fade. He currently has 309 career doubles, with 20 so far this year. If he hits another 10 in 2014, he\'ll need 28 doubles a year for the next decade to get to 600. It\'s not happening. Adam JonesAge: 28 (turning 29 on August 1)MLB seasons: 9    If you think of the face of this Orioles team, you\'re probably thinking about Adam Jones. He deserves the recognition, a charismatic player who\'s embraced Baltimore and has a level of great performance on the field to back up when he decides to pop off to reporters by saying things like, ""Why don\'t you ask Tanaka what it\'ll be like to face me?"" As far as his chances of hitting a magic Hall of Fame number, he\'s probably looking at 500 home runs as his ticket in. He\'ll be 29 in a matter of days and he has 159 home runs to date in his career. That is a long climb. If he equals adds another 10 home runs this year - 19 so far in 101 games - he\'d only need to hit 33 home runs a season for the next decade to get himself to 500. That would put him at age 39 at the end of his journey. Not likely. One thing working in Jones\' favor, though, is that he\'s actually developed power as a hitter as his career has gone on. He probably doesn\'t have any 50 homer seasons in him to shave time off the back end. Father Time will come for him eventually. Still, what if the Orioles continue to be a good team for the next five years, Jones continues to be the best player on those good teams, and they eventually win a World Series? That would be something. Jones has it in him to get some of the postseason heroics that voters love, if the rest of the team can keep getting him there. Four All-Star teams, three Gold Gloves, at least one top-10 MVP season and possibly more coming. Voters love that stuff too. A long shot, but not a no-shot. Manny MachadoAge: 22MLB seasons: 3 Winning the first ever Platinum Glove for best fielder in the American League in his age 20 season certainly doesn\'t hurt for Machado, because double-digit Gold Gloves is just the sort of thing that gets you Hall of Fame steam. Does Machado have that in him? He might not add another this year since he missed a lot of time, but once he got back up to game speed, he looks to have the same brilliance in the field, just mind-blowing transcendental defensive talent.    He stands something of a chance as a hitter too, if his bat grows the way that we hope. Machado, at his young age, has already gotten himself 308 hits in his career. He is getting about a hit per game played this year; if he adds another 60 by year\'s end, that would leave him needing 2,632 hits to get 3,000, a fortuitous number for Orioles fans. If Machado chips away at that number over 15 years, leaving him ""only"" 37 at the end of it, that would be about 174 hits per year through 2029. No big deal, right? Machado\'s still young enough that we can dream about how his bat will develop, but as Markakis shows us, sometimes that never really happens. Machado hit 51 doubles last year, for instance, about one for every three games played, but he only has 10 through 66 games this year. If he gets better and stays better for a long time, and stays healthy, he could be a player with a strong case for multiple facets of his game. Then, we\'d still have to hope he spent all of that time on the Orioles to get elected as an Oriole. Also a long shot, if only because so much can go wrong over 15 years. Chris DavisAge: 28MLB seasons: 7 This was worth talking about briefly last year as Davis went on to hit 53 home runs. He\'s now batting .203/.312/.392, a full 300 points of OPS below where he was last year. Davis has 146 career home runs. He\'s even behind Jones, though he\'s a year younger. Davis has hit about one home run for every five games played - let\'s say he\'s good for another 12 this year, putting him at 158 career homers. He\'d only need 34 home runs a year for the next decade from that point. It\'s hard to even imagine him playing for another decade.    Chris TillmanAge: 26MLB seasons: 6 300 wins? Tillman had 32 career wins heading into this season. At this time last year, he was on a pace to win 20 games on the season, making it briefly worth considering, well, what if he kept up that pace. This year, he\'s on pace to win 10. Thanks for playing, Chris. He has one 200-inning season under his belt and is not on pace to get another one this year. Perhaps in a year\'s time, Kevin Gausman will be wowing us enough to shift our wild pitcher extrapolation dreams to him. ** Let\'s get crazy and say that Jones plays out his career with the Orioles, has a few years where he\'s solidly in the second tier behind Mike Trout, wins a World Series, and crawls over the 500 home run plateau when he is 39 years old, then retires. The year is now 2024, meaning that, if Jones somehow got in on the first ballot, he would be inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2030. I will turn 47 later that year. All things are possible in this crazy new world of Orioles baseball, make no mistake. But when it comes to one of these guys getting into the Hall of Fame, it would be a good idea not to hold your breath.

The question is, if he continues to hit the way he has been and playing great defense, could Yastrzemski see another promotion this season from Double-A to Triple-A.If so Yastrzemski would have started 2014 in Single-A Delmarva and ended it in Triple-A Norfolk. To say this young man is on the rise would be an understatement.Delmarva Shorebirds14 1/3 innings. That is the number of scoreless innings Luis Gonzalez has thrown since giving up a run in the top of the second inning of Delmarva\xe2\x80\x99s July 9th game. The 22-year-old from the Dominican Republic has made a name for himself so far this year as a Shorebird.He has a 5-0 record in 12 games played (11 games started). Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s perfect record is due in part to his phenomenal 2.44 ERA and great walks:strikeout ratio (5:17). In his last outing on July 24th, Gonzalez pitched six scoreless innings, limiting the Rome Braves to just three hits. By striking out eight batters in his last start, Gonzalez now has over 50 strikeouts this season (51). A promotion to the next level this season is almost guaranteed for this future star.\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

But visiting the home parks of each of the three Baltimore-based members of the Cal Ripken League should have been easier than it was. The Baltimore Redbirds offered a fun experience, while the Baltimore Dodgers need some work to engage the fans. And all of the Baltimore teams pale in comparison to the fan experience offered by the DC area-based teams of that same league, especially the Bethesda Big Train, who I also visited recently.So I finally saw a game for Youse\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles as they played the Silver Spring-Takoma ThunderBolts. This team plays out of the Bachman Sports Complex Park in Glen Burnie. That complex has a variety of softball fields to go along with the single baseball field. There are not many seats at this field, but it is clear that it is a well-maintained facility; but it really could use a scoreboard. Fans are often friends or family of the players, with some locals stopping by on the way to softball games. They are knowledgeable. Games are free and a concession stand can be found over by the softball fields.The Youse\xe2\x80\x99s Maryland Orioles is a longstanding team and organization. Started in 1952, it gets its name from\xc2\xa0Walter Youse, who managed the team from 1957 until his death 9 years ago. The team has been very successful over the years as they have won the All American Amateur Baseball Association(AAABA)\xc2\xa0Championship 29 times and as recently as 2013. Reggie Jackson, Al Kaline and Steve Clevenger\xc2\xa0are just a few of the players to have played for this team before making the major leagues.\xc2\xa0Clevenger has, of course, has been sent down to Norfolk as the Baltimore Orioles have a bit of a jam at catcher currently.The team recently pulled out of the 2014 AAABA championship as their roster has been depleted by professional signings and the lack of enough in-state players. The\xc2\xa0AAABA rules state that at least 50% of your roster must be local. Essentially the Orioles are stuck between fielding locals-only players and maybe performing\xc2\xa0at a lesser level during league play, or nationally recruiting for league competition, as they have, and therefore \xc2\xa0having to miss the national competition held each year in Johnstown, PA. Before pulling out, the team was considered\xc2\xa0the best\xc2\xa0in nearly every category: including wins (269), runs scored (2907), winning percentage , and championships.Youse\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles had players from schools such as Mississippi, Delaware, Virginia Tech and even CCBC Dundalk on their roster, while the T-Bolts roster had players from schools such as LaSalle, Marshall, Maryland and\xc2\xa0Gallaudet.\xc2\xa0Our home opener is tonight vs. @Alexandria_Aces. 7PM first pitch at Bachman Park\xe2\x80\x94 Youse\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles (@Youses_Orioles) June 6, 2014 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Ravens Roster: First 4 Players Out, Last 4 ...', 'Next1 of 3Prev postUse your \xe2\x86\x90 \xe2\x86\x92 (arrows) to browseWhen training camp and preseason comes around, there\xe2\x80\x99s a concept called the \xe2\x80\x9cbubble\xe2\x80\x9d.

He has been on the team for three years and has seen playing time in each season. However, he never blossomed into the receiver or the kick return man that they envisioned him to be. In my opinion, this will lead to his departure and he will not be included in the 53-man roster. Also note that the Ravens drafted wide receiver Micheal Campanaro and picked up undrafted free agent Jeremy Butler.Phillip Supernaw, TESupernaw won\xe2\x80\x99t miss the roster due to a lack of displayed talent on the practice field.

The Ravens recently acquired Owen Daniels who will immediately be inserted into the second slot. The team also drafted Crockett Gilmore in the third round of the 2014 draft, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t draft a player in the third round only to kick him off the team three months later. You can not have four tight ends on a roster which means that although Supernaw has impressed the Ravens throughout, he will likely not be a part of the 2014 Ravens.A.Q. Shipley, CShipley played dreadfully last year when he got the chance, perhaps even worse than Gino Gradkowski. Although both Centers performed very unimpressively last season, I think that Shipley will be the one that misses the cut.Jeromy Miles, FSAfter going undrafted in the 2010 draft, Miles signed with the Cincinnati Bengals. He was released in September of 2013 and was claimed off waivers\xc2\xa0by the Ravens just a couple of days later. He actually did participate with the team last year, but mostly on special teams. He ended the season with ten tackles. After signing a one-year deal with the Ravens, he has made the case to perhaps make the roster once again. However, I think that Anthony Levine, who has a very similar role to Miles, will grab his spot instead and Miles will find a home on the practice squad unless needed on the active roster.Next1 of 3Prev postUse your \xe2\x86\x90 \xe2\x86\x92 (arrows) to browse  var tpsInstance;var tpsOptions = {""slideContainer"":""#tps_slideContainer_6188"",""nav"":["".theiaPostSlider_nav""],""navText"":""%{currentSlide} of %{totalSlides}"",""helperText"":""Use your \\u2190 \\u2192 (arrows) to browse"",""defaultSlide"":0,""transitionEffect"":""simple"",""transitionSpeed"":200,""keyboardShortcuts"":true,""numberOfSlides"":3,""slides"":[{""title"":""Baltimore Ravens Roster: First 4 Players Out, Last 4 Players In"",""permalink"":""http:\\/\\/thebaltimorewire.com\\/2014\\/07\\/27\\/baltimore-ravens-roster-first-4-players-last-4-players\\/"",""shortCodeTitle"":null,""content"":""<p>When training camp and preseason comes around, there&#8217;s a concept called the &#8220;bubble&#8221;.

Their pitchers yielded two runs and 13 hits in those wins, and the bullpen continued its dominant run.Their relievers own a major league-best 1.78 ERA over the last 21 games after ranking 25th with a 4.13 mark for the season. Closer Huston Street hasn\'t allowed a run in four appearances and converted all three of his save opportunities since being acquired from San Diego.""If you can go five and keep us in the game, it\'s almost a guarantee they\'re going to come in and put up a zero,"" starter Hector Santiago said after limiting Detroit to one run in 5 1-3 innings of Sunday\'s 2-1 victory. ""We used to be scared if we left guys on base. Now it\'s like we just sit back and watch the rest of the game.""Los Angeles, which ranks second in the majors with 4.9 runs per game, averaged just 3.0 runs during its 6-4 homestand, but has won six of seven on the road while averaging 7.1 runs and hitting .312.Trout was 4 for 26 over the last seven games but he\'s batting .430 with nine homers, eight doubles and 26 RBIs over his last 20 road contests. He leads the majors with a 1.040 OPS on the road and has seven homers in his last 13 games versus Baltimore.The Orioles (58-46) went 6-4 on their 10-game road swing and took two of three in Anaheim last week to improve to 6-2 in their last eight against the Angels. Baltimore starters posted a 1.77 ERA over 20 1-3 innings versus the Angels and a 2.92 mark on the road trip, picking up an offense that has scored more than four runs just once in the last 15 games.Chris Tillman (7-5, 3.92 ERA) gave up one run in six innings without a decision in last Wednesday\'s 3-2 loss at Los Angeles.""They\'ve got a good lineup,"" Tillman told MLB\'s official website. ""They are going to battle all night long ...It never felt like you had the game in hand. They grinded me out tonight, put some real good at-bats together.""Tillman is winless in five straight starts despite a 3.09 ERA, touting a 2.53 run-support average in that span. He won his previous two career starts versus the Angels, though, and has limited them to four runs over 20 2-3 innings in three matchups.Jered Weaver (11-6, 3.36) gets the nod for the Angels, having gone 4-0 with a 2.68 ERA in his last seven starts. He improved to 5-2 with a 2.28 ERA in his last seven matchups with Baltimore last Wednesday opposite Tillman, limiting the Orioles to two runs over eight innings.""My fastball command has been pretty good the last couple of games, and I feel like I\'m getting stronger every time out,"" Weaver said. ""So I just want to keep working on it and keep establishing it because it sets up everything else.""Nelson Cruz is second in the majors with 29 homers but is just 15 for 69 (.217) versus Weaver, and his 22 strikeouts are the most of any player against the right-hander.

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles completed a successful West Coast road trip of 10 games in 10 days with a 3-2, 10th-inning victory over the Seattle Mariners. All in all, O\xe2\x80\x99s fans have to be pleased with a 6-4 record over those games against some of the best pitching in MLB.The strength of opponent pitching is evident in the fact that the Orioles only batted .201 over the 10 games. Winning six contests in light of that is pretty amazing\xe2\x80\x94attributable to the 3.17 ERA of the pitching staff.The Orioles came out of the All-Star break with a four-game lead in the AL East over both the Jays and Yankees. The Jays have picked up one game, while NY remains four games behind. The Rays have won nine of the last 10 to get now to 7.5 games behind the Birds. The Red Sox appear to be falling off the edge of the earth \xe2\x80\xa6 oops, there they go \xe2\x80\xa6 gone! Have a happy fall \xe2\x80\x93 without baseball this year.On this Sunday afternoon, the Orioles managed to come away with a win in a game they did not necessarily deserve to win \xe2\x80\xa6 not that they deserved to lose, but it was one that could have just as easily gone the other way. The Orioles squandered a number of opportunities to add runs and build some margin. And as always, good defense was an additional asset for the Birds.Manny Machado was the probable MVP of this game \xe2\x80\x93 getting two hits and two RBIs, including a final sac fly game winner on an 0-2 pitch in the top of the 10th inning.Miguel Gonzalez did his typical contribution of hanging around and holding the Orioles in the game long enough to eventually have a shot at winning. Over six innings he allowed eight hits and two walks, all of which is enough to get a pitcher into more trouble than giving up only a single run. And that is all he allowed. He competes. Gotta love him for that.The Orioles return home for six games \xe2\x80\x93 three each against the Angels and Mariners. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking more about matchups in posts this coming week, but one quick note is to say that the Orioles will not have to face Felix Hernandez. He will be pitching on Wednesday. They will likely have to face Hisashi Iwakuma next Sunday.After the six games at home, the Baltimore Orioles will hit the road for a single game in Washington, followed by three in Toronto. After that is five home games against the Cardinals and Yankees. So, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will be playing 25 consecutive games after the break against teams with winning records, before finally seeing the Indians\xe2\x80\x94who are at this moment only one game under .500.Hopefully the Orioles players remember how to get to Camden Yards. The last game there was on July 13th, so it will be 16 days between games in Baltimore. What a schedule this has been this year.The Orioles have again now played more games on the road versus at home\xe2\x80\x9455 to 49. The Orioles are three games over .500 at home, but have an excellent 32-23 road record. Only the Detroit Tigers have been better on the road. If the Orioles could sweep this six-game home series, they could match their road record \xe2\x80\xa6 now there\xe2\x80\x99s something to shoot for!The 58 wins by the Orioles is exceeded in MLB only by the A\xe2\x80\x99s, Angels, Brewers, and Dodgers.The Birds are also 35-12 in extra innings wins over the past three seasons. That is a statistic about which to be particularly pleased.There are no especially good trade rumors out there to comment upon. The most common name mentioned a bit with the Orioles is catcher Kurt Suzuki. It would be great to have his bat in the lineup, but there is the issue of gaining comfort with the pitching staff. So this sort of falls into the category of \xe2\x80\x9cif it ain\xe2\x80\x99t broke\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9dApparently Dan Duquette is disinclined to part with young pitching talent, and I think most O\xe2\x80\x99s fans would applaud that position. The entire Ubaldo Jimenez situation may have quelled the fanbase\xe2\x80\x99s regular criticism of wanting to make bold moves, but being disappointed in what is accomplished. The best overall situation for the Baltimore Orioles at this point may be to go to war with the army they currently have. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: A Tale of Two Gausmans - Birds Watcher', 'Gausman has had an up-and-down season, with some interesting trends to note. Mandatory Credit: Ed Szczepanski-USA TODAY SportsOn Friday, Kevin Gausman started for the Baltimore Orioles. He continued what has been a largely splendid season, as he limited the Seattle Mariners to one earned run over 6.2 innings.\xc2\xa0While another obligation prevented me from watching, I did take a gander at Twitter, to see this humorous observation:Gausman is 4-0 in wins and 0-3 in losses? No way.. pic.twitter.com/u5kL8491Du \xe2\x80\x94 connor (@connorgucci69) July 26, 2014The pointlessness of a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s win-loss record notwithstanding, this inconsistency struck me as odd. I decided to look into it, to see if Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0peripherals were this fickle.As it turns out, they are. Gausman has started nine games this year, with an overall SIERA of 4.44; if he had enough innings, that would rank 84th out of 93 qualifiers. In other words, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t pitched that well overall. However, on a start-by-start basis, I saw something interesting: He has never come close to that figure in any one outing.In four of Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s starts\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 June 18th against the Tampa Bay Rays, July 20th and June 7th against the Oakland Athletics, and July 6th against the Boston Red Sox\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 his SIERA was at or below 3.40. That mark would rank 26th in the majors, and would be better than the likes of Adam Wainwright and Julio Teheran. By contrast, in the other five starts\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 July 13th against the New York Yankees, July 25th (Friday) against the Mariners, June 12th against the Toronto Blue Jays, May 14th against the Detroit Tigers, and\xc2\xa0June 27th against the Rays\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s SIERA was at or above 4.97. That mark would rank 91st in the majors, and would be worse than the likes of Travis Wood and Eric Stults.What has driven these dichotomous results? Primarily, strikeouts. In the four good games, Gausman fanned at least 21.7% of the batters he faced; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t top 11.1% in any of the other five.\xc2\xa0His K%s and SIERAs have an R^2\xc2\xa0of .916, indicating a very strong correlation. While his walk, ground ball, and fly ball rates correlate decently to his SIERA (with\xc2\xa0R^2s of .308, .279, and .259, respectively), we should attribute most of his SIERA variability to punchouts.Let\xe2\x80\x99s shift our focus to those, then. We can take them seriously, as Mike Podhorzer\xe2\x80\x99s xK% equation proves their legitimacy. Indeed, the relationship\xc2\xa0between his xK%s and his SIERAs is actually stronger, with a correlation coefficient of .924. Furthermore, correlating the individual components to his strikeout rates, we see that S/Str% (the percentage of strikes that are swinging) accounts for most of the K% variability, as its\xc2\xa0R^2\xc2\xa0sits at .454.So, to summarize all of that: Gausman has had four superb games, and five terrible games. He derived most of his success from strikeouts, and he derived most of his strikeouts from whiffs. To determine the cause of the latter, we\xe2\x80\x99ll delve into PITCHf/x data.For the year as a whole, Gausman has accrued most of his whiffs on two pitches: the splitter, and the four-seamer, which account for 36 and 33, respectively, of his 81 total swings-and-misses. The former excels via its quality (it has a 24.5% swinging-strike rate against); the latter, via its quantity (he throws it 69.2% of the time). Location-wise, he generally has the most success with the splitter when he paints the lower left portion of he plate with it\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6while his four-seamer does well when it goes to the upper middle part of the plate:If we break this down on a start-by-start basis, a pattern emerges. In the five bad starts, he did one of a few things wrong: He didn\xe2\x80\x99t utilize the splitter enough; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t locate it properly when he did; or, if he did the former two, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t locate the four-seamer properly.Let\xe2\x80\x99s go through on a start-by-start basis \xe2\x80\x94 starting with the poor ones:In the Detroit start, he threw only seven splitters (8.1% of his total pitches), and all to the lower right of the plate.He made a similar error in the New York game, as he used it a mere five times (6.4%), and put it in the middle-to-upper left of the plate when he did.Pitching in Toronto, he implemented it 10 times (9.9%), but only four of those were in the bottom left.His second outing in Tampa actually saw him use it even more, at 21.1%; plus, most of those were in the lower left. However, he placed the four-seam fastball in the middle left, for whatever reason.The Seattle game was even worse: While he fulfilled the first two conditions handily, he threw the four-seamer seemingly everywhere but up.Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the splendid ones:In his first bout in Tampa, he pounded the lower left with the splitter, and did so often (26.1% of his pitches).His second Oakland game was virtually analogous, with a 23.9% splitter rate to accompany a heavy focus on the lower left.The first time around the bay had him using it less (15.9%), but eschewing the top and middle, as well as the right and center.While in Boston, he threw it less too (14.4%) and drifted toward the middle left when he did; nevertheless, a top-heavy approach with the four-seamer bailed him out.So the method to Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s madness thus far? Throw the splitter to the lower left, and good things happen; don\xe2\x80\x99t, and bad things happen. It might sound overly simple, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the way it is. If he can just realize this, he could tap into Dr. Jekyll every time out, instead of Mr. Hyde.All statistics courtesy of\xc2\xa0Baseball-Reference.

Mandatory Credit: Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY SportsThe post-All-Star break road trip all Orioles fans were dreading turned out to be pretty positive. Ordinarily, the Orioles on the west coast is a recipe for disaster, but Baltimore managed to go 6-4 for the trip, and 5-2 for the week, on the back of excellent starting pitching.Oddly enough, the Orioles managed to lose ground in the AL East on the road trip. They had a four-game lead at the All-Star break over the New York Yankees, and now have a three-game lead over the Toronto Blue Jays, a four-game lead over the New York Yankees, and a seven-and-a-half-game lead over the resurgent Tampa Bay Rays.Despite a shrinking lead, the Orioles really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have expected \xc2\xa0too much more out of the road trip and should be happy the divisional situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t worst.Their hitting was non-existent for a majority of the road trip and it was only because of their starting pitching and bullpen performances that they are still in first place.Since coming back from the All-Star break, the Orioles have batted a combined .196, good for dead last in the AL.Steve Pearce and Nelson Cruz cooled off, Chris Davis continued to struggle, Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s hot hitting was interrupted by a three-game injury hiatus, forcing Ryan Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s cold bat into the lineup.Their pitching, however, saved the day. Specifically, Wei-Yin Chen (11-3, 3.92), Miguel Gonzalez (5-5, 3.91) and Chris Tillman (7-5, 3.92).It is a theme that has become prevalent in the 2014 season. Hitting disappears, pitching shows up.It is also this theme that brought the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 2012 playoff run to an end in New York during the ALDS.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers carried the team on their backs (with the exception of then-closer, Jim Johnson), but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough.If the Orioles want to make a prolonged playoff push in 2014, they really need to fix the inconsistencies in their lineup. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s through adjusting the order, adding a player via-trade, or just taking extra reps in the cages, Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 brass can\xe2\x80\x99t cross their fingers and hope the hitters aren\xe2\x80\x99t cold come October.As for right now, things are going right for Baltimore despite some glaring offensive issues.Offensive player of the week: Delmon Young. With just two games played over the week, Young made his limited playing time count. Going four-for-eight with a home run, a double, and three RBIs, Young provided an \xc2\xa0important spark for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup. It will be interesting to see how his playing time changes now that Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s bat has cooled.Pitcher of the week: Miguel Gonzalez went 1-0 for the week in his two starts. He combined to pitch 13.2 innings, allowing just three runs. He went from being potentially the odd-man out with the trade-deadline approaching, to being one of the hottest pitchers in the league.

That\'s how it usually goes, but on Monday afternoon, the two-headed Fox Sports tandem reported that the Orioles have contacted the Red Sox about Jon Lester:     Orioles among the teams that have contacted Red Sox on Jon Lester, sources tell @Ken_Rosenthal and me. @FOXSports1\r \xe2\x80\x94 Jon Morosi (@jonmorosi) July 28, 2014     Well, now that\'s an eye popper. Lester is the kind of pitcher who would represent an unambiguous upgrade for the Orioles rotation. This is not debating whether Jorge de la Rosa will do better outside of Colorado or whatever. This is talking about renting a strong left-handed starter, who\'s dialed in for his contract year. Lester, in particular, is striking out about a quarter of all batters he faces, while he walks only about 5%. Those are very un-Orioles starter-like numbers. So\'s his 2.52 ERA, and so is the fact that he averages nearly seven innings per start. He\'s been so good that you almost can\'t even imagine him being on the Orioles because the Orioles, as a rule, don\'t get pitchers this good.    Of course, saying the Orioles have ""contacted"" the Red Sox about Lester isn\'t telling us very much. For all that we know, the conversation consisted of Dan Duquette asking the Sox if they had gone insane and decided to give away Lester just for laughs, and the Sox then hung up on him. It could have just as easily been Duquette calling up the Boston front office, hearing what they wanted back, and then moving elsewhere in his discussions.    The non-waiver deadline is Thursday at 4pm Eastern. When considering baseball rumors, one important thing to keep in mind is that the sheer volume of rumors is such that most of the time, a given rumor will amount to nothing at all. That doesn\'t mean it\'s false - although many of them probably are, even from respected reporters - just that the information it offers amounts to nothing. It could be true that the Orioles contacted the Red Sox about Lester and this fact could be completely and utterly meaningless in the scheme of who the O\'s do or don\'t acquire.    What would the Red Sox ask for two months of Lester? Probably more than the Orioles would be willing to give up, although I guess you never know. Barring an injury, he\'ll make another 10-12 starts, plus any that he might make in the postseason, should the team that trades for him get their way into the postseason. Lester is also due in the vicinity of $4.3 million for the remainder of the season. It\'ll probably never happen, but it\'s worth getting excited for a minute thinking about it. Now that the moment has passed, let\'s sit back and prepare ourselves for disappointment when Tim Berry is traded for two months of Kurt Suzuki.

07/29/2014,"[(""Orioles trade rumors: Other teams feel O's are unwilling ..."", ' Well, guys, we might as well write off this season. Some dope who writes for the New York Post has proclaimed that the Orioles are ""not showing the stomach"" for a big move because\xc2\xa0they\'re unwilling to deal their top tier young pitchers. (WARNING: Link contains an image of Derek Jeter\'s face in a sidebar, as well as ""This Day In Derek Jeter History"" and something called The Jeter Countdown)    The Post\'s Joel Sherman describes multiple executives who\'ve dealt with the Orioles as saying the Orioles are not willing to move any of the following players: Kevin Gausman, Dylan Bundy, and Hunter Harvey. Maybe those executives are just offering weak deals. Who is out there on the market who\'s worth parting with any one of those three guys? Other than David Price, probably not anybody, so no wonder the Orioles don\'t want to deal them. Does this mean that anybody else is fair game? Dan Duquette has shown he will deal anyone who\'s not at the top of the prospect deck so far, dumping people from the fringes and deep in the minors in what he feels is the right move. Even for trades we don\'t like at the time, such as last year\'s move of Nick Delmonico for reliever Francisco Rodriguez, the Orioles haven\'t been burned yet. Delmonico was suspended for 50 games earlier this week. Tongue-in-cheek joking aside, if you were panicking about whether the O\'s would make a stupid trade, this news is welcome, even if Mr. New York Post says otherwise. If Gausman, Bundy, and Harvey are off the table, the possibilities for a regrettable trade are much less. Sherman and Fox Sports\' Ken Rosenthal both add that the O\'s don\'t appear to be interested in Twins catcher Kurt Suzuki, with one reason being concerns over how he would mesh with the pitchers.    The non-waiver trade deadline is Thursday at 4pm Eastern. As of this posting, there are about 48 hours left to make deals. Nothing looks imminent right now, but that\'s a lot of time left to swing something. Right around now a year ago, it didn\'t look like the O\'s were going to make a move, and then suddenly there was Bud Norris.

""That\'s primarily what we\'re focused on.""Baltimore currently has five dependable starters \xe2\x80\x94 Chris Tillman, Miguel Gonzalez, Wei-Yin Chen, Bud Norris and Kevin Gausman. Not only that, but Ubaldo Jimenez (ankle sprain) is close to leaving the disabled list.So Duquette isn\'t necessarily looking for a front-line starter, primarily because the cost would be too high.He is more likely to shore up the bullpen. At this point, however, nothing is imminent. If nothing happened at all, Duquette would be fine with the team as it is currently constructed.""So far, so good,"" he said. ""Every team has strengths and areas we could improve upon. Our team is like that. We have been able to get more consistent starting pitching, which will cover up a lot of areas of your team. We\'ve been able to execute defensively, which has helped us win the close games. This is a good ballclub.""     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } It cuts deep: The \'great tiebreaker pitch\' changes MLBBaltimore started the day with a 2 1/2-game lead over Toronto and a 4 1/2-game advantage over New York. Duquette isn\'t satisfied, but he isn\'t going to mortgage the future for a quick fix.He would rather call upon his minor leaguers down the stretch than deal them away.""We\'d like the star players to come up and make an impact on the team,"" Duquette said. ""In 2012, we brought up Manny (Machado) and he made a difference in the pennant race. In 2014, we\'ve got Kevin Gausman on our team, and we hope he will impact the race. So that\'s really the first choice, to have those really talented players play for us and prove themselves in the big leagues.""If he can\'t get a pitcher, Duquette might be in the market for a second baseman or catcher. Rookie second baseman Jonathan Schoop is batting .216, and starting catcher Matt Wieters is out for the year after undergoing elbow ligament replacement surgery.""If you look at it, those are a couple areas where we could improve,"" Duquette said. ""We have the defense. If we could add to our offensive team, that would probably be something we could take a look at.""DEREK JETER\'S FAREWELL TOURFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInDerek Jeter\'s farewell tour\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Absalon, USA TODAY Sports)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles have a knack for winning in extra innings, and it has nothing to do with luck.Manny Machado homered leading off the 12th inning, and the Orioles survived a rocky outing from starter Chris Tillman in a 7-6 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Tuesday night.Baltimore is 12-3 in extra innings and has won seven straight.""To do that, you\'ve got to have a good effort out of your bullpen \xe2\x80\x94 and we did tonight,"" manager Buck Showalter said.Orioles relievers gave up one run and five hits over the final seven innings. After Ryan Webb (3-1) worked out of a two-on, two-out jam in the 12th, Machado took care of business in the bottom half with his first career game-ending homer.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Jon Lester scratched from start, so what\'s next?Machado hit a 1-2 breaking ball from Cory Rasmus (2-1) into the seats in left field to end the back-and-forth duel between AL contenders.The Orioles were 16-2 in extra innings in 2012, and this is shaping up to be that kind of year.""We have good chemistry in the clubhouse like we did back then and obviously we have a good bullpen as well,"" Machado said.Adam Jones and Nick Markakis homered for Baltimore, playing its first home game since the All-Star break.Josh Hamilton homered and had three RBIs for the Angels, who have dropped eight of their last 11 against the Orioles. Los Angeles got a solid performance from its relievers, who allowed three hits over six-plus innings.""Our bullpen did a terrific job,"" manager Mike Scioscia said. ""You can\'t ask much more from those guys. We couldn\'t get that one hit that would get the game on our terms.""A potential pitching duel between Jered Weaver and Tillman turned into a slugfest, as both former All-Stars left after the fifth inning with Baltimore leading 6-5.Weaver gave up a season-high six earned runs and walked four. Tillman yielded five runs, three earned, and six hits \xe2\x80\x94 including three doubles and a home run.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Nightengale: Philly blockbuster could disrupt quiet deadlineAfter Hamilton delivered a run-scoring grounder in the top of the first, the Orioles scored twice in the bottom half. Jones drove an 0-2 fastball over the left-field wall \xe2\x80\x94 giving him 20 home runs for a fourth straight season \xe2\x80\x94 and J.J. Hardy added an RBI single.Los Angeles capitalized on a throwing error by Tillman to take a 3-2 lead in the second before Machado doubled in a run in the Orioles\' half.After Hank Conger hit a sacrifice fly for the Angels in the fourth, Weaver issued two walks in the bottom half and Markakis followed with a drive off the right-field foul pole to make it 6-4.Hamilton homered in the fifth and tied it in the seventh with an infield hit.TRAINING ROOMAngels: Left-hander C.J. Wilson (right ankle sprain) pitched 5 1-3 innings for Double-A Arkansas on Monday night in his first rehab start and could return soon. ""There is definitely one scenario where it could be this weekend, but we\'re not going to commit to anything,"" Scioscia said.Orioles: First baseman Chris Davis did not play after being sent home with a stomach virus. ""He was sick all day (Monday) and didn\'t seem to be making a marked improvement,"" Showalter said.ON DECKAngels: Right-hander Garrett Richards (11-3) seeks to rebound after his seven-game winning streak ended last week against Detroit. In his only previous start against Baltimore, Richards allowed a career-high seven runs in 2012.Orioles: Kevin Gausman makes his first career start against the Angels as the Orioles seek their ninth win in 11 games at Camden Yards.WEAVER\'S WOESThe Angels were 7-0 in Weaver\'s previous seven starts, and it took a comeback for the right-hander to stay unbeaten since June 16.""Fastball was up for most of the time and I couldn\'t really figure out how to get it down,"" he said.

The Orioles are playing excellent baseball with the Blue Jays and even Yankees staying within range.The Orioles are a season-high 13 games above .500 with a 16-7 record in the month of July. The Rays were a season-worst 18 games below .500. Read that again, and read the standings again.The Rays are now a single game below .500 as of July 29th. The Blue Jays and Yankees may be within five games, but the Rays are the most dangerous team the Orioles have to deal with.

Every AL East team, except the Red Sox, has a winning record in July, with the Rays having the best record.Between the Blue Jays, Yankees, and Rays, they have a combined 23-7 record over each of their past 10 games. The Orioles are 7-3.Though there is a difference, the Orioles have played tough teams, such as the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s and the Angels, while the Blue Jays and Yankees have\xc2\xa0not faced any true competition with exception of battling each other.Despite playing to impressive records, the Blue Jays and Yankees have not proven they are any true danger to the Orioles before the September matchups.I consider the Rays more of a danger to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 chances of finishing in first place. They have played against good teams and managed to stage an amazing comeback, which I hope does end well for them. \xe2\x80\x9dI consider the Rays more of a danger to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 chances of finishing in first place\xe2\x80\x9dAfter the road trip, I wish the Orioles had a stronger lead, but the AL East never cooperates.The Orioles need a strong August to stay ahead of the pack. They have one series against the Blue Jays, Yankees, and Rays. These series will be key in holding first place.Right now, the Orioles are playing like a playoff team. August is going to test them, and with the way the rest of the East is playing, the Orioles are going to have to muster up all the strength they have.Thankfully, the series against the AL East teams will help to ease the load if they can win them.If the Orioles play the cards right, they could easily hold a commanding lead heading into September.The Blue Jays and Yankees have mixed schedules leading up to September with good and bad teams. This makes the Orioles winning the series against them even more important.The Orioles may be playing for October in the long run, but right now, they need to set their eyes on September.September baseball is going to make or break their playoff chances if they do not create more space in the AL East.

I suppose that makes sense given how young he is.  Machado would later tell MASN that he \xe2\x80\x9cfelt chills running the bases\xe2\x80\x9d after hitting the home run that delivered the Baltimore Orioles a 7-6 victory in 12 innings.  And with good reason perhaps; something magic is happening in Baltimore.Chalk up one of those \xe2\x80\x9cin between\xe2\x80\x9d starts for Chris Tillman. The same could be said for his counterpart Jared Weaver. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an awful night for the starters, but certainly not easy either. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 6 H, 5 R (3 earned), 1 BB, 5 K. Josh Hamilton recorded an RBI-ground out in the first inning, putting the Orioles immediately in the hole. However in what became a theme for the night, the Orioles battled back. Adam Jones sent a solo home run into the left field grandstand in the last of the first, and Nelson Cruz scored on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single.Again, answering the bell was the theme. Anaheim stormed right back in the second inning, as Howie Kendrick scored from third base as David Freese reached safely on Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s throwing error which tied the game. Conger would add a sac fly-RBI, and suddenly Anaheim had the lead. But not for long; Nick Hundley drew a one-out walk in the last of the inning, and he scored on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re scoring at home, that\xe2\x80\x99s 3-3 after two innings!Anaheim would take another slim one-run lead in the fourth on another sac fly-RBI by Conger, but once again the Baltimore Orioles answered the call. Nick Markakis came up in the last of the fourth with two runners on, and he sent a deep shot towards the right field foul pole. As the ball flew my personal opinion was that it would hook just inside the pole. I suppose I was right about the net result, but instead of brushing past the pole the ball flat out hit it. Suddenly the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a two-run lead at 6-4\xe2\x80\xa6that is until Josh Hamilton sent a solo shot out an inning later to cut the lead to 6-5.With two outs in the seventh, Brian Matusz induced Josh Hamilton to ground into what should have been a routine fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice for J.J. Hardy (with a runner on first base). However Ryan Flaherty, who was playing second base, was slow to cover the bag, forcing Hardy to throw to first instead. Hamilton had hustled down the line and was safe at first base\xe2\x80\xa6allowing Albert Pujols to score from third, tying the game. For the most part Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s defense is pretty solid; but that was a pretty bad mistake.Needless to say, Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s rouse ended up sending the game to extra innings (all things being equal) as nobody scored again before the end of nine. Anaheim put two runners in scoring position in the top of the twelfth against Ryan Webb, however Alex Aybar lined out to Steve Pearce at first base to end the threat. As we went to the last of the inning, the thought of a marathon game started to creep into people\xe2\x80\x99s heads given the fact that the bullpens were starting to get fairly empty. That\xe2\x80\x99s when the idea starts to enter the minds of managers in that it might be necessary to burn a starter if need be.Luckily, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to happen in this game. Machado\xe2\x80\x99s walk off home run ended the game,Courtesy of Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportsand propelled the O\xe2\x80\x99s to victory once again. Machado would also say afterwards that the feeling in the clubhouse and around the ballpark was starting to resemble 2012.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles pitcher Kevin Gausman has a rare arm. You can\xe2\x80\x99t teach 98-mph fastballs in the seventh inning. You can teach placement, sequence, and secondary pitches that will make the fastballs even more unhittable. And all of this is what young Kevin Gausman is learning.Before his last call-up to the Orioles, my friend Blaine Beatty \xe2\x80\x93 the pitching coach at AA Bowie \xe2\x80\x93 sent me a text message with a picture of the two of them. He simply entitled it, \xe2\x80\x9cOur future.\xe2\x80\x9d Blaine is one of those in the organization who has worked with Gausman to encourage the development of his secondary stuff. And when it all comes together \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 it is regularly going to look like it did Wednesday night in Baltimore.\xc2\xa0For the first 14 Angels batters, Gausman was in total control. None reached base; nothing was hit particularly hard. Gausman was living on the corners and his secondary pitches were salted and peppered into the sequence in a fashion that kept everyone completely off balance.This could become a regular experience. Teams around Major League Baseball know this, and Dan Duquette is probed continuously about Guasman\xe2\x80\x99s potential availability at times such as this trade deadline.It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen. DD is not going to mortgage the future in any event. And why give away the future when the future is today? What was seen Wednesday night is as good as most anything that could be secured in return. Gausman is very quickly learning on the job. Becoming a successful major league pitcher has a learning curve \xe2\x80\xa6 along with learning a curve.Becoming a successful major league pitcher has a learning curve \xe2\x80\xa6 along with learning a curve. (Did you catch that? I went figurative on you before I went literal.) Lessons were learned on this evening \xe2\x80\x93 Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s 15th career start in the big leagues \xe2\x80\x93 on the way to getting a 4-3 win and pushing his record to 5-3 for this season.Orioles broadcaster Rick Dempsey is famous for saying that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing good happens after a walk.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, if that is true, then it is three-times as true that nothing good happens after three consecutive walks.With 14 consecutive Angels having been sent back to the dugout, Gausman walked three batters in a row to load the bases with two outs in the top of the fifth inning. Two run-scoring hits immediately followed and the O\xe2\x80\x99s 4-0 lead was reduced to 4-3. Mike Trout was at the plate with runners at second and third. Gausman threw five fastballs ranging from 96-99 mph before fanning him with an 88-mph forkball to end the threat and put out the fire.If the truth be told, Gausman should have been out of that inning before any hits were registered. He did not get calls on the corners several times. And telling the truth on this matter means telling the truth (from my six decades of avidly watching this sport) that plate umpires in MLB are worse not than they have ever been. Variation from ump to ump is understandable, but the inconsistencies are inning-by-inning realities.Gausman fell into a pattern over this series of five batters that reached base where he attempted to be just a little bit too fine, rather than trusting his stuff. He got out of rhythm with the umpire as he was suddenly throwing more balls out of the zone. No umpire (except the most grandiosely arrogant) want to draw all the attention to themselves by ending a big rally with giving the pitcher a strike call on the black. Gausman should have been out of the inning.

There is no way he will be pitching for anyone else before he becomes a free agent well into the future.The Baltimore Orioles have really played their cards well with Kevin Gausman. Duquette is not exactly a wizard\xe2\x80\x94as that designation is for the GM of a different sort of bird in the Baltimore Harbor area.

He was expected to be in uniform for Baltimore on Friday against Seattle.""Miller\'s emergence this year, being able to get out right-handers along with lefties, made him very attractive,"" Duquette said. ""Not just to us. We ended up getting him, but there were a lot of other clubs that were in the market for left-handed relievers. His capabilities and his performance this year really distinguished himself from any other players in that position in the market.""Duquette liked the Orioles\' starting rotation and didn\'t want to give up a player on the current 25-man roster, so adding Miller appeared to be just the right move.""This is one area where we could strengthen our club without giving up an asset on the current team,"" Duquette said.Since becoming a full-time reliever in 2012, Miller has a 2.78 ERA in 140 games while averaging 13.3 strikeouts per nine innings. His contract expires after this season, so there\'s a chance he won\'t be with the Orioles beyond this year.""We know Andy Miller is going to be a free agent,"" Showalter said. ""We think he can impact our ability to make the playoffs. We\'re willing to take that risk.""The 21-year-old Rodriguez is 3-7 with a 4.79 ERA in 16 starts with Double-A Bowie this year.""I\'m not excited about losing Eduardo, but you\'ve got to give up quality to get quality,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""It\'s a tribute to our farm system that we could sign and develop someone that brought Andrew.""Duquette said, ""We hated to give up a young left-handed pitcher. We tried a lot of other combinations short of Eduardo Rodriguez, but in this case it was required to make the deal. ""Although Miller isn\'t necessarily a huge name, he comes to the Orioles on a day their division opponents lost star pitchers Jon Lester (Boston to Oakland), John Lackey (Boston to St. Louis) and David Price (Tampa Bay to Detroit).""I\'m hoping we play well enough to see them again,"" Showalter said.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe trade deadline is a confusing time for any baseball G.M. On the one hand, contending teams want to add talent that could push them into the playoffs and potentially a World Series. This is especially true in an era where players leaving during free agency is so common that keeping a core group of players together for a multiple years can be difficult. Because of this G.M.\xe2\x80\x99s know that the window for a World Series run is most likely small.However, on the other hand when it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious some core players may be lost to free agency, it can be dangerous trading away the young talent that could one day replace them. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to find the balance between win now and build for the future.If the season ended tonight the Orioles would join Oakland, Los Angelos Angels, Detroit and Toronto in the playoffs. Out of those teams it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious Oakland and Detroit made the most headlines at the trade deadline. However, just because the Orioles failed to close any of the numerous headline-grabbing deals they were linked to doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 G.M. Dan Duquette is giving up trying to make the team better for the playoff run.It\xe2\x80\x99s true that teams are always looking to acquire pitching, specifically a front of the line starter. However, there is a large market for starting pitching which means a lot of teams to outbid. A cheaper option may be to add a veteran position player into one of the weaker spots in the lineup, which would be second base and catcher.Ryan Flaherty and Jonathan Schoop have played excellent in the field and have both collected key hits. However, combined the two are hitting .211 with 117 strikeouts and 12 homeruns. Flaherty would probably do better in a full-time utility role and Schoop would probably benefit from some at-bats in AAA. If the Orioles could add a Gordon Beckham or Brandon Phillips type player it would do a lot to lengthen the lineup, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cost the team a top prospect.Catcher may be the most difficult move to make. Throwing even a veteran into handling an entirely new pitching staff mid-way through a season is a lot to ask, and the platoon of Caleb Joseph and Nick Hundley has been terrific defensively. However, the Orioles have gotten almost no production offensively from the position since Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 injury. Joseph is hitting just .192 while Hundley is hitting .209 since becoming an Oriole. Teams tend not to part with good catchers, but the Orioles could find a veteran in even the second-tier of catchers that would be an upgrade.Anyone who has followed the Orioles knows Dan Duquette doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shy away from a deal, and the Birds did get better today by adding Andrew Miller. Just because the trade deadline has come and go doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the Orioles are done making moves. Duquette is well aware of his team\xe2\x80\x99s short comings, and is probably on the phone with teams right now. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

But thankfully Wei-Yin Chen was there to cheer you up with another outstanding starting performance.    Through the first three innings of the game, the only baserunner that that Mariners had reached on an infield single by Robinson Cano. With two outs in the first inning and the infield shifted to the right side, Cano hit a ball on the ground towards third base. Machado managed to get to the ball and even make a throw, but he just couldn't get Cano at first. Chen wasn't fazed as he went on to retire the next eight batters before he let Cano reach again, this time on a solid single to left field. When the Orioles got a run in the third inning of tonight's game, I thought maybe they would go on to score a bunch more and make us all feel better. Delmon Young, who was playing left field tonight (more on that in a minute), led off the third inning with a double, and after Caleb Joseph and Jonathan Schoop struck out, it looked like he might be stranded. But Nick Markakis hit a ball about halfway between third base and home plate that died on the grass (and maybe had a little help from catcher Mike Zunino, who picked it up before it stopped rolling). Young moved to third base on the infield single, then came in to score on a line drive back up the middle by Machado. Nice! That put two runners on for Adam Jones, but the birthday boy struck out on one of the ugliest swings I've seen in awhile. Unfortunately the Orioles didn't get to enjoy their lead for too long. Chen struck out Dustin Ackley for the first out in the fourth, but then the previously mentioned Cano single put a runner on base. Kendrys Morales hit a ball down the left field line that Delmon Young did not play well. Morales would have had a double no matter what, but the Mariners third base coach had begun motioning for Cano to stop at third. But when he saw Young moseying after the ball in left field, he changed his mind and waved him in. Young threw in to the relay man and Hardy's relay throw home was almost perfect. If Joseph had held on to the ball it could have been interesting, but it trickled away from him. I think he would have been safe either way, but it would have been very close.    That tied the game, which sucked, but Chen got right back to being awesome, which did not. He retired Kyle Seager and Chris Denorfia, then cruised through the fifth, sixth, and seventh innings with little trouble. Ackley did reach third base in the sixth on a single and two ground outs, but Chen struck out Seager to strand him.    So while Chen was mowing down the Mariners, the Orioles were laying an egg against Mariners' starter Roenis Elias. They found themselves with two on and just one out in the fourth inning after Nelson Cruz doubled and J.J. Hardy walked, but Young hit into a 6-4-3 double play to end the inning. Curses! Wasting a Cruz hit AND a Hardy walk is just a shame. (Although to be fair, Cruz's double was mostly a misplay by center fielder Austin Jackson, but since Cruz had been 0 for his last 21, we'll cut him some slack) In the sixth inning the Orioles got another leadoff double, this one from Machado. They got lucky on the next play, when M's shortstop Chris Taylor fielded a ground ball from Adam Jones. Manny ran to third on contact and Taylor thought about going to third base to try and tag him. Taylor hesitated, dropped the ball, and couldn't get anyone out. Manny looked far enough from third that a good quick throw probably would have gotten him, but at the very least Taylor should have had the play at first.    Just like in the third inning, the Orioles had a runner in scoring position with no outs, only to see the next two batters strike out. This time it was Cruz and Chris Davis. Sigh. At least Joseph and Schoop have the excuse that \xc2\xa0they are Joseph and Schoop. Cruz and Davis are, in theory, the heart of the order. They both struck out looking, and while Cruz\xc2\xa0should have been ashamed of himself, Davis at least had\xc2\xa0a right to some beef  with the umpire. Thankfully for those two jokers, Hardy wasn't in the mood to play any more extra innings. He hit a sharp single back up the middle that went past a diving Cano, resulting in a 2-1 Orioles lead on an unearned run. Roenis was pulled from the game with two on and two out, and Young grounded out on the first pitch from relief pitcher Tom Wilhelmsen to end the inning. Finally given another lead, Chen didn't let this one get away. He pitched a very quick seventh inning and started the eighth with 94 pitches. That's the danger zone for Chen, but Buck Showalter had new Oriole Andrew Miller warming in the pen. Chen got Chris Taylor to pop up for the first out, but then walked Austin Jackson. Buck pulled him then, at exactly the right time in my opinion. The crowd of 39,487 gave Chen a huge ovation as he walked off the field, and he deserved it. Well done, Wei-Yin Chen!    Just as the roar for Chen died down, it picked up again as the Ryan Wagner introduced Andrew Miller to the crowd. It was a nice warm welcome to the newest Oriole, and he almost got his team out of the inning immediately with a ground ball to second base. Schoop went to Hardy at second for the first out, but the relay throw wasn't in time. The ball just wasn't hit hard enough and Ackley beat it out. Ackley then took off for second base with Cano at the plate, and Joseph made a rare defensive miscue, throwing the ball past second base and into center field. Ackley raced to third base. Once Ackley got off of first base, it looked like Miller didn't mind pitching around Cano. Can you blame him? Cano went to first with a walk, and Miller got a ground ball to shortstop from Morales to end the inning. Welcome to Birdland, Andrew Miller! An insurance run would have been nice at that point, don't you think? Sure, Zach Britton is a shut down closer, but things happen. Machado singled to start the bottom of the eighth and things looked promising. It was Manny's third hit of the night! But then after Jones flew out, Manny ran on a ball hit in air by Cruz. It was hit kinda hard, and kind of towards the gap, but some on, Manny. Ackley made the catch in left and easily doubled Manny off of first to end the inning. Just for that he's not going on the MBP ballot! That'll teach him. Thankfully they didn't need the insurance run, because Britton made it look easy in the ninth. A ground ball to shortstop, a ground ball to second base, and a fly ball to left and the game was over. O's win! Good night.

08/02/2014,"[(""The Baltimore Orioles - Not Buck Showalter's First Rodeo"", ""From 1998 to 2012, the Baltimore Orioles were one of the most disastrous franchises in baseball. After making the playoffs in 2012 and winning 85 games in 2013, they have recently\xc2\xa0become one of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s premier teams. A\xc2\xa0reason, perhaps the biggest reason \xe2\x80\x93 Buck Showalter.They failed to end the season with a winning record in any year from 1998 through 2011 and only eclipsed the 70-win mark once. In 2012, they came out of nowhere and made a magical playoff run. The team won 16 extra-inning games in a row, the closer Jim Johnson saved 51 ball games in 54 attempts; they went 29-9 in one-run games and got career-years from multiple players.In 2012, they ended the year 93-69 and made the playoffs as a wild card team. They upset the favored Texas Rangers in the first-ever American League Wild Card game before extending the New York Yankees to five games in the American League Divisional Series. The O\xe2\x80\x99s won 85 games the following year, proving to the baseball world that the Baltimore Orioles are back on the map.The main reason for the sudden turn of events was the Manger of the bullpen by the name of Buck Showalter. He has a history of turning losing teams into winning ones in the blink of an eye.Starting with Yankees: He took over as manager in 1992 when they finished the season with a 76-86 record. They won less than 75 games in each of the last three years as well. In 1993 \xe2\x80\x93 one year after Showalter took over the team \xe2\x80\x93 the Yankees won 88 games finishing second in the American League East division, which contained seven teams at the time.Live Feed Buck ShowalterYankees Derek Jeter week rolls on; Here's what's happening Yanks Go Yard10 things we've learned so far this MLB season FanSidedBaltimore Orioles execute a weird triple play on Boston Red Sox FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck Showalter The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Buck Showalter's Most Memorable Ejections The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles Clicking on All Cylinders The Baltimore WireThe next year the Yankees won the division with a 70-43 record in a strike-shortened season. In Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s final year with the Yankees (1995), they finished the year with a 79-65 record, which means \xc2\xa0he lead a team that had losing records in four straight years to having winning records in three straight years.After a a three-year absence from the managerial position, he made similar magic with the Arizona Diamondbacks. After winning 65 games in his first year there, the D-Backs all of a sudden won 100 games in 1992, earning the division crown. After another three year absence, he was signed by the Texas Rangers and did the same exact thing to them, except it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite as impactful. After winning 71 games in his first season with the Rangers (2003), he lead them 89 wins in 2004.After laving the Rangers in 2006, he served as a baseball analyst on ESPN for a few years, before being signed by the Orioles at the end of the 2010 season. After leading the worst team in baseball to a 34-23 record in the last 57 games of the season, the O\xe2\x80\x99s won just 69 games in 2011. However, all it meant was that his magic would be delayed by just one year as the O\xe2\x80\x99s won 93 games in 2012, 85 in 2013, and have gone 60-47 through the first 105 games in his fifth season with the Orioles.Here are his career managerial stats:RkYearAgeTmLgWLW-L%GFinishWpostLpostW-L%post1199236New York YankeesAL7686.46916242199337New York YankeesAL8874.54316223199438New York YankeesAL7043.61911314199539New York YankeesAL7965.54914525199842Arizona DiamondbacksNL6597.40116256199943Arizona DiamondbacksNL10062.61716217200044Arizona DiamondbacksNL8577.52516238200347Texas RangersAL7191.43816249200448Texas RangersAL8973.549162310200549Texas RangersAL7983.488162311200650Texas RangersAL8082.494162312201054Baltimore OriolesAL3rd of 33423.59657513201155Baltimore OriolesAL6993.426162514201256Baltimore OriolesAL9369.574162215201357Baltimore OriolesAL8577.525162316201458Baltimore OriolesAL6047.5611071It makes you wonder why no teams gave him a chance in the 11 years he was free for.The knock on him is that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to maintain any of those teams as he has never had longer then a four-year stint with any specific club. However, that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the case with the Orioles. He has already been with the team for four and a half seasons and will be with the team at least through the 2017 season as they signed him to a three-year extension last year.I\xe2\x80\x99m a big fan of saying: coach\xe2\x80\x99s don\xe2\x80\x99t win games, players do; but there are few exceptions and Showalter is one of them. In 2012, the Orioles did nothing to upgrade on roster from the 69 wins in 2011, yet they still won 34 more games. How do you explain that?\xc2\xa0 "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: A win for Wei-Yin Chen and for Taiwan', 'Wei-Yin Chen said something after last night\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 victory that really struck me. He told Steve Melewski of masnsports.com of a tragedy that had occurred in his hometown back in Taiwan:Unfortunately back in my hometown, there was a horrible accident \xe2\x80\x93 a gas explosion which took away thousands of lives.\xc2\xa0Today, this win I would like to give out to my home people and I want to send out my best wishes. Hope everyone is all right there.I echo Chen\xe2\x80\x99s sentiments; I hope that that all of the affected people are doing as well as can be expected. I think that sometimes we take for granted how difficult it might be for someone like Wei-Yin Chen to have to come to America and not only be expected to pitch at the highest level but also to learn our culture and be so far from all of the people he knows and loves. \xc2\xa0Ultimately, baseball\xe2\x80\x99s just a game. What happened in Chen\xe2\x80\x99s hometown is real life. In a game that he dedicated to folks back in his homeland, Chen didn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line:Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sports7.1 IP, 5 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 8 K. Those eight strikeouts were a career-high for Wei-Yin Chen, who seemed to mix his pitches very well throughout his outing last night. He\xe2\x80\x99s never been the hardest thrower in the world, but the way Chen gets hitters out is through late movement in the strike zone, which if applied correctly can be deadly. Seattle saw that first hand last night.Unfortunately for the Baltimore Orioles, Seattle starter Roenis Elias was almost just as good. He stymied Oriole bats for most of the night. Seattle has one of the best starting staffs and bullpens in the league, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be overly concerned about Oriole bats. In fact, it should be duly noted that the Orioles won this game without the benefit of the home run ball.The O\xe2\x80\x99s took a 1-0 lead in the third when Manny Machado singled home Delmon Young from third base. Young had led off the inning with a double, and he went to third on Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x98 infield single. However Seattle came right back in the fourth. Robinson Cano reached on a one-out single, and he was doubled home by Kendrys Morales. There was a close play at the plate, and for a split second it appeared that the Orioles might have Cano nailed at home. However catcher Caleb Joseph dropped the ball, and the game was tied.Machado led off the sixth with a double off the scoreboard in right field, which came mere feet away from leaving the yard. However Machado also got a pass in a sense when he made a mental mistake a few moments later. On a grounder that was hit by Adam Jones to Machado\xe2\x80\x99s right, he broke for third. However shortstop Chris Taylor misplayed the ball, allowing Jones to reach (on an error) and allowing Machado to get to third. Base runners are taught to stay on second base if a ball\xe2\x80\x99s hit to their right side; it\xe2\x80\x99s also very possible that Taylor was so surprised to see Machado in motion that he misplayed the ball.Either way, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had runners at the corners after Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s error. J.J. Hardy ran the count full (with two outs) before singling up the middle into center field. Machado touched home, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s held a 2-1 lead.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 newest acquisition, Andrew Miller, recorded the final two outs in the eighth inning to bridge the gap to Zach Britton in the ninth. Miller received a great ovation from the faithful at Camden Yards, which really took him for a ride if his postgame comments are any indication. He seemed to really appreciate the fact that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans were happy to have him on the team for the rest of the way; these types of situations can be awkward (coming to a new team mid-year) especially given the fact that Miller came from a division rival, but Miller seems to have had no trouble fitting in thus far.Britton sent Seattle down 1-2-3 in the ninth, and the Orioles had themselves a 2-1 win over Seattle. Boston also beat NY while Houston beat Toronto, putting the Orioles back up by 2.5 games in first place. The series continues this evening with Miguel Gonzalez taking to the hill for the Birds. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by James Paxton.Before yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game the Orioles also announced that they had signed LHP Joe Saunders (a former Oriole in his own right) to a minor league contract. Saunders formerly pitched for Texas, but was released earlier this year. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how, if at all, the O\xe2\x80\x99s plan on using Saunders (at the big league level, that is), but either way it\xe2\x80\x99s a move to shore up organizational depth. Furthermore, if Dan Duquette had been considering trading for a starter on waivers this month, the signing of Saunders might in effect fill that gap and save the Orioles a prospect. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Will Baltimore Orioles Pitching Excel in Final Third of ...', 'Feb 14, 2014; Sarasota, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles pitchers prepare to work on bunting drills during FridayAs of Friday night\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 victory over the Mariners, the Baltimore Orioles are now 61-47 on the season. This total of 108 games marks the exact two-thirds completed portion of the 2014 season, with 54 more to play.By way of reference, the Orioles were 59-49 at this point last year, and 57-51 in 2012. That last number continues to stand out as amazing, since the Orioles were 36-18 from that point forward.Could the Orioles put together that sort of streak again? It is not impossible. They are 9-5 since the break, and a win tonight (Saturday) would be on that pace. The O\xe2\x80\x99s have won\xc2\xa0 30 of their last 47 games\xe2\x80\x94with the ERA of the pitching staff dropping from 4.28 to 3.69 over that span. The starters\xe2\x80\x99 ERA in those 47 games is 3.05.More on pitching and hitting statistics in a moment, but what do we make of the won-loss record for the Orioles at this point, and what can be anticipated for the final third of 2014?For much of the first half of the season, Orioles fans walked about with a feeling that though the Orioles were in contention, they really should have been in a bit better position considering all of the injuries sustained by other teams. Along the way also there was a sense, continuing even to this moment, that more than a couple of the Orioles players have not hit their stride at all this year.Yet here we are at the beginning of August and two-thirds through the season, and the Orioles have the third-best record and win-loss percentage in all of baseball. Only the A\xe2\x80\x99s and Angels are better, while the Orioles are essentially tied with the Dodgers\xe2\x80\x94who have the best in the National League.Much has been rightly made of this opening 16-game post-All-Star break stretch against the A\xe2\x80\x99s, Angels, and Mariners. It was thought to be critical for the season; and indeed it is \xe2\x80\xa6 yet again the Birds are 9-5 with hopes of another win or two this weekend.Does it seem like the Baltimore Orioles are always playing teams with winning records and seldom see \xe2\x80\x9ceasier\xe2\x80\x9d competition?\xc2\xa0 If you feel that way, you are actually correct. Over this first 108 games, 62 were against teams with .500 or better records, with 46 against those with a losing record. The next 12 games are against winning teams, though the following 26 games will feature teams with current records under .500.\xc2\xa0 And then the final 16 games of the regular season are against New York and Toronto, except for three versus the Red Sox.If you put that all together, it totals out to 90 games against winning teams and 72 against losing teams.The Orioles were thought at the beginning of the season to be a powerful offensive outfit with very suspect pitching. But this is why they play the games! \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryThough the Orioles do display power\xe2\x80\x94being second only to Toronto in the AL in total home runs\xe2\x80\x94the O\xe2\x80\x99s are eighth in batting average at .257, 11th in on-base percentage at .311, and seventh in runs per game at 4.20 (which is .04 below the league average).By contrast, the Orioles are #3 in runs allowed per game at 3.92 (behind Seattle 3.33 and Oakland 3.46), are #6 in ERA at 3.69 (Seattle #1 at 3.06) and #7 in WHIP at 1.299, which is just a fraction better than the league average. Again, Seattle is the top team in that statistic and in most categories, slightly better than the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s.So it will be good for the Orioles to be done with the Mariners after this weekend. And an interesting fact is that the Toronto Blue Jays have seven games on their remaining schedule with the Mariners, including four at home just before the Orioles come to town for the final three games of the regular season.

The two other American League division leaders added aces at the nonwaiver trading deadline on Thursday, with the Oakland Athletics trading for Jon Lester from Boston and the Detroit Tigers acquiring David Price from Tampa Bay. The Orioles grabbed a standout left-handed reliever, Andrew Miller, from the Red Sox but did not change their rotation.

But there are at least some surface-level comparisons.Gausman and Wacha were drafted in the first round in 2012, Gausman fourth over all, Wacha 19th. Both played at major college programs, Gausman at Louisiana State and Wacha at Texas A&M. They even have similar stuff.\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody on our staff is pitching great right now, and we\xe2\x80\x99re pitching great at the perfect time,\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what it was all about for Wacha last year, getting hot at the right time.

Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY SportsFollowing up on a season in which Chris Davis hit .286/.370/.634, won the Silver Slugger Award, finished third in MVP voting, and smashed a MLB-leading 53 home runs and 138 RBI was going to be difficult. No one expected a repeat performance. However, no one expected this type of regression, either.In 2014, Davis has been a liability at the plate when he used to be one of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 biggest assets. We knew he had the potential to be an all-or-nothing type of batter, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing\xe2\x80\x9d meant a sub-.200 batting average while still leading the team in strikeouts and placing ninth on the team in slugging percentage.That\xe2\x80\x99s not the Chris Davis we fell in love with last year. It\xe2\x80\x99s not even the extremely solid .270/.326/.501 power hitter he was in 2012.No, this is a new Chris Davis. A, dare I say, bad Chris Davis. And because of that, it\xe2\x80\x99s also a Chris Davis who deserves to see the field less.Orioles manager Buck Showalter always expresses patience with his players \xe2\x80\x94 often saying that if they can play defense, he\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for the bat to come around.Chris Davis can play defense. This year, he\xe2\x80\x99s posted his highest fielding percentage ever as a first baseman \xe2\x80\x94 a gold glove potential .997. His big frame and uncanny ability to stretch and scoop balls in the dirt provides a forgiving target for Orioles infielders.But the time has come to lessen the impact of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 struggles. The Orioles have other options at first base in Steve Pearce and Nick Markakis. Putting Pearce or Markakis at first allows the hot-hitting Delmon Young to see the field in a corner outfield position and improves the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense. The offensive improvement Young brings overcomes the advantage Davis holds over the other first base options on defense.Davis has hit .193/.267/.376 vs. left-handed pitching this year. Meanwhile, Young has hit .255/.255/.400 against lefties this year and holds a .301/.337/.467 career average against them.When the Orioles face a lefty, it presents the best opportunity to get Davis out of the lineup and give Young a few more at-bats.Until the Orioles are confident that Davis can get back to where he was in 2012 or 2013, other players give the team a better chance to win than he does. With the Orioles only 2.5 games ahead of the second-place Toronto Blue Jays in the AL East, every at-bat counts. When Chris Davis is up, Baltimore is giving away those precious at-bats in hopes that the Davis of yesteryear reverses a trend that has gone on far too long.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWhenever I hear Joe Saunders brought up into a conversation about baseball, my mind always drifts back to that day in October of 2012 when he pitched 5 2/3 innings of work in the American League Wild Card Game. He helped the Orioles advance to the ALDS to face the Yankees by allowing just one run and striking out four batters during his start.Since then he has pitched for the Mariners in 2013 and the Rangers this season where in eight games he posted a 6.13 ERA and an 0-5 record. Most recently, Saunders has been playing for Kansity City\xe2\x80\x99s Triple-A \xc2\xa0affiliate where he had an even more unimpressive 6.75 ERA in four starts with the ball club. Because of this performance he was released by the Royals earlier last week.The last time he posted good numbers from the mound were in 2012 with the Buckle Up Birds when he had a 3.63 ERA over seven games with Baltimore. You could say Saunders had Oriole Magic pumping through his veins that year.In an attempt to get that Oriole Magic back in his arm, the Orioles signed Saunders to a Minor League contract on Friday. He will report on Monday to the Norfolk Tides. He will report to the Tides however not as a starter, but as a relief pitcher.This is a low-risk, high reward move by Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter. There are no promises that Saunders will turn things around with the Tides and be Major League-ready come September when the Orioles call up many players for their final push to the Postseason.However, the Orioles have made a habit of turning unreliable starters into great relief pitchers. Just looking at Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s current roster alone, there are two pitchers that come to mind. Tommy Hunter was a starter in 2011 and 2012 for the Orioles where he had a combined 10-11 record with a 5.26 ERA. In 2013, Hunter made the switch to the bullpen and saw immediate improvements. Last season he had a 2.81 ERA. Although he struggled in the closer role early this season, Hunter settled in nicely as a set-up man and now has a 3.86 ERA.Zach Britton, after three seasons with over a 4.60 ERA, has been \xe2\x80\x9clights-0ut\xe2\x80\x9d in 2014 as a reliever and as a closer. With 22 saves under his belt this season, Britton has become one of the more reliable closers in the Majors.\xc2\xa0Could Saunders be yet another starter-turned-reliever in the Orioles organization?

The Mariners defeated the Orioles 6-3. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsMany years ago I played on the golf team for my high school. My coach was a colorful personality filled with great one-liners. And when I would leave a putt a foot short of the hole, he would say, \xe2\x80\x9cRandy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that it is statistically true that 95% of putts that are left short of the hole don\xe2\x80\x99t go in?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Indeed. True statement.The same is true in baseball with runners in scoring position (RISP). When a team does not get a hit in that situation, it is virtually impossible to win the game \xe2\x80\xa6 probably not 100% as on the golf green, but nearly that bad.Until Ryan Flaherty delivered a pinch hit two-out RBI in the ninth inning on Saturday night, the Baltimore Orioles were 0-for-11 with RISP. The Birds simply could not get runners home, in spite of opportunities throughout the game.The first Orioles run was delivered by Adam Jones in the bottom of the first inning on a ground out to second, and Caleb Joseph hit a solid homer into the left-field corner. That was about it for scoring, as the Baltimore Orioles dropped the second game of the series to the Seattle Mariners 6-3.Miguel Gonzalez simply did not have his good stuff on this evening. His command was loose, and his balls did not have the late movement that so often makes him difficult to hit.Gonzo yielded a solo shot in the third inning to Dustin Ackley, but the big blow of the game was a fifth inning three-run bomb by Robinson Cano that gave the Mariners a 4-1 lead at that point. The Orioles have historically been killed by Cano, and they have been fortunate so far this season to have kept him under control \xe2\x80\xa6 until last night.As I wrote in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s article about the final third of the season, the Mariners statistically have the best pitching staff in the American League, even slightly better than the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s.But somehow the Baltimore Orioles have got to find some more offense. Where is it going to come from?Back on July 25th I wrote an article entitled \xe2\x80\x9cIs Nelson Cruz becoming a Hole in the Baltimore Orioles Lineup?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Well the answer is in; and the answer is \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He struck out three times last night and is flailing wildly at low and outside pitches.In his last 20 games, Cruz is 8-for-82 (.097) with one home run and two RBIs.

But on June 24th, the O\xe2\x80\x99s beat him 4-0 on the particular strength of a three-run homer by Delmon Young.How about if Buck gives Cruz a day off and lets Young DH, with David Lough in left field?

Seattle starter Hisashi Iwakuma matched Chris Tillman point-for-point. While Iwakuma nearly pitched a complete game, Tillman (who only pitched seven innings) was just a hair better.Tillman gave the Orioles all that he had yesterday, and at one point retired 14 consecutive Seattle hitters.

When Nick Markakis sent a 3-2 pitch over the scoreboard in right field to lead off the game, nobody in attendance thought that would be the only run of the game. Quite frankly, had someone told me that the O\xe2\x80\x99s would be kept off the scoreboard for the rest of the day, I would have predicted a loss \xe2\x80\x93 and a big one at that.However the fact that the lone run off the bat of Markakis stood up and delivered the Orioles toCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportsa game and series victory over Seattle is a testament to Chris Tillman and to the bullpen of the Baltimore Orioles. As I said, Tillman went through the middle innings by retiring 14 consecutive Seattle hitters.  Short of tossing a perfect game, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do much better than that. Tillman came out of the game after the seventh inning, and Orioles fans got their second look at Andrew Miller who was traded to the Birds of course on Thursday from Boston. Miller retired Seattle 1-2-3, and bridging the gap from Tillman to the ninth inning. Zach Britton retired the first two ninth inning batters with east, but then walked Robinson Cano and took Kendrys Morales to a full count before striking him out looking to end the game.While it goes down in the scorebook as just a simple 1-2-3 inning, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen thus far why the Orioles were so hot on Andrew Miller. Certainly it\xe2\x80\x99s not always going to be that easy, however Miller\xe2\x80\x99s answered the call each time it\xe2\x80\x99s come thus far. And we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget that the whole deal of going from the team you\xe2\x80\x99ve known all year long and being traded to a new team mid-year isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy.The other side of this game is of course the fact that the O\xe2\x80\x99s could only muster the one run. I would submit that run-scoring can in fact be cyclical. There were several games last month whereby the O\xe2\x80\x99s were consistently scoring 5+ runs in games. Now it seems the bats have gone quiet for some time. Luckily for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, the pitching has really stepped up as the bats have quieted down. Again, all of this is cyclical.After taking two-of-three from Seattle, the Orioles will tonight head down the pike to DC where they\xe2\x80\x99ll make up the game that was rained out on July 8th. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see who sits tonight, as with the O\xe2\x80\x99s playing in Nationals Park they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to surrender their DH. Might it be Chris Davis, with Steve Pearce playing first base? Time will tell. Kevin Gausman will get the ball tonight, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Tanner Roark.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles right fielder Nick Markakis had to be aware of the droves of critics over the most recent offseason. Without doubt, Markakis suffered through his worst season in 2013. And the question was essentially this: Was his lackluster performance the result of a series of injuries that included the beaning by CC Sabathia at the end of the 2012 season, or was his decrease in production due to a decline in skills as he gets older?Some of the criticisms mocked him as a slow, singles only spray-hitter, certainly unworthy of the leadoff position. Though he does indeed lack some of the characteristics of a leadoff hitter in terms of speed and base-stealing potential, he does work counts and get on base.

He hits lefties and righties at virtually the same average. And his defense is at the top of the sport, evidenced by his Gold Glove awards and nightly outstanding plays. His current streak of 283 consecutive games without an error in the outfield is a franchise record.Markakis is #1 in the American League in plate appearances with 505. He ranks fifth in hits with a total of 131, and his batting average of .286 is well within the top 20.After being drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1st round (7th pick) of the 2003 amateur draft, Markakis is now the longest-lasting of O\xe2\x80\x99s players. With three hits on Sunday, he passed the 1500-hit plateau, and only Brady Anderson (1,589) has more hits as an Orioles outfielder.Markakis is making $15 million this year, as he did in 2013. There is an option for him to be retained by the Orioles for $17.5 million in 2015. In March of this year, it was pretty much unanimously assumed that the Birds would not be very likely to exercise that to bring him back at such a cost.

It turned out that all the O's bat needed to get back in action was some NL pitching, as they scored more than four runs for only the third time since the All-Star break.    Gausman was shaky throughout the entire game, but as Caleb Joseph said in his postgame interview with Gary Thorne and Mike Bordick, he threw just enough good fastballs to stay out of major damage. In his six innings pitched he didn't have a single 1-2-3 inning and gave up a total of eight hits and two walks. Gausman gave up back-to-back two-out singles in the first inning, but struck out Ian Desmond to strand the runners. But the Nationals got on the board first in the second inning on a solo home run from Wilson Ramos. The Orioles had a good chance to score in the top of the second, when Chris Davis walked and J.J. Hardy singled with one out, but Davis had a major TOOTBLAN, being doubled off of second base easily after Ryan Flaherty flew out to center field. Oh, Chris. You make me so sad. It was a nice night at the plate for Joseph, and he tied the game at 1-1 in the top of the third inning. He hit a solo home run, his 5th, to left field. It was a no doubter, and I have to ask: Is there any player on the Orioles more fun to see succeed than Caleb Joseph?    Gausman really played with fire in both the third and fourth innings as the the Nationals put runners on first and third with no outs in each. But in each inning, Gausman limited the damage to just one run. In the third he gave up a sacrifice fly and in the fourth he allowed a run to score on a double play ball.    The way the Orioles have been scoring runs lately, a 3-1 deficit felt less like two runs and more like 10. But they got one back on a home run by Nick Markakis in the fifth inning, then broke out for three in the seventh to go ahead for good. The Nationals started Tanner Roark tonight and the word on the street is that he's a good pitcher. He looked ok early on, but by the time he was knocked out of the game, I didn't see what the fuss was about. Back-to-back doubles by Hardy and Flaherty (Flarht's was THIS close to being a homer) tied the game, and after Joseph moved Flaherty to third with a bunt, pinch hitter Delmon Young singled up the middle. That made the score 4-3, but the Orioles weren't finished. Ross Detwiler replaced Roark but wasn't much better. Both Markakis and Manny Machado singled to load the bases.    Adam Jones then stepped to the plate, the 7th batter of the inning. Adam to that point had been 0-for-August, but it ended with an RBI single. The O's looked ready to really break out as they still had the bases loaded with just one out, but the Debbie Downer we know as Nelson Cruz grounded into a double play to end the inning. Those runs put Gausman in line to get a win, though he struggled for it. While he didn't give up any more runs after the fourth inning, he did allow a single in the fifth inning and two more baserunners in the sixth. He was pinch hit for by Young in the top of the seventh inning and replaced on the mound by Brad Brach in the bottom of the inning. His final pitching line was: 6 IP, 8 H, 3 R, 2 BB, 3 K, 1 HR, 107 pitches/60 strikes. He battled, as they say. Brach was outstanding in relief, pitching two perfect innings with two strikeouts. His reward was getting to bat for himself in the top of the ninth, and he gave the ball a ride to center field, but sadly it was an easy out for Denard Span. Brach has really been a pleasant surprise this season, don't you think?    The O's last two runs came in the eighth inning on a two-RBI single by Joseph. He knocked in Davis, who had singled just through the shift in right field, and Hardy, who was on base with his fourth hit of the day. Though Brach had just batted for himself, Darren O'Day still came in to pitch the ninth. He was awesome, as usual. He retired all three batters he faced on a total of nine pitches, and he struck out Danny Espinosa swinging to end the game. O's win!

Pitchers RHP Tanner Roark, Nationals2014: 21 GS, 134.2 IP, 2.74 ERA, 103 SO, 29 BB, .230 BAA, 1.08 WHIPLast start (at Marlins): 7 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 1 HR, 2 BB, 7 SO Roark hasn't gone less than seven innings in a start since June 27. He made five starts in July and pitched 35 innings. Too bad the Orioles can't find somebody like that. Of course, American League snob that I am, I automatically dismiss most non-Kershaw-related National League pitching accomplishments, but Roark is performing so well that you have to figure he'd still do good even if he pitched against AL teams regularly. It sure helps to face pitchers and crappy hitters so often, though. Being as Roark is one of these guys who never walks anybody anyway, maybe the O's will turn their aggressive hackmaster tendencies into something positive. Then again, they walked twice against Hisashi Iwakuma on Sunday, which was almost a miracle, and they still only scored one run. That was enough.    RHP Kevin Gausman, Orioles2014: 10 GS, 56 IP, 3.70 ERA, 37 SO, 21 BB, .261 BAA, 1.34 WHIPLast start (vs. Angels): 7 IP, 3 H, 3 ER, 3 BB, 2 SO Across the games he's started this year, Gausman has had a pattern emerge that when he makes it six innings, it means he's pitching well. If it doesn't, then he's probably not. That sounds a bit obvious, but it's not: there are plenty of pitchers who might give up four runs in six innings. It's a small sample size anyway, only ten starts, five that were 6+ and five that weren't. One of the short ones was a rain-interrupted five inning complete game that was actually pretty okay. You know, just forget I said anything.

His current ERA is pretty nice, but his peripherals suggest some luck involved, as he has a career-low BABiP (.279) and an above-average strand rate. Buehrle this year looks more like the pitcher Toronto thought they were getting after their big trade with the Marlins in the '12-'13 offseason. His current ERA is impressive, but even someone who has such a track record of defying his peripherals probably can't keep the gap quite so large all year. Buehrle throws three fastballs (four-seamer, sinker, and cutter), plus a curveball and changeup. He pitches lefties and righties pretty similarly, using his fastballs nearly two-thirds of the time and his change a little more than his curve. The main difference is that he goes to his sinker as an out pitch against righties, while he prefers his changeup late in the count against fellow lefties. Maybe hot: Nick Markakis (1.154 OPS, 50 PA), Delmon Young (1.108 OPS, 50 PA)    Likely not: J.J.

Oddly enough, he hasn't made a start against Toronto since late 2012. Chen's FIP-ERA difference might suggest he's benefited from some luck, but his HR/FB% is still a little high (12.7%). His xFIP, which adjusts FIP based on a league-average home run rate, is 3.70, in line with his ERA.    Hutchison lost part of 2012 and most of 2013 to Tommy John surgery, not seeing any time in the majors last year. His peripherals this year are decent (strikeout and walk rates right around the league average), but his ERA isn't, despite the usual indicators of luck (BABiP, LOB%, HR/FB%) suggesting nothing out of the ordinary. The righty throws mostly four-seam fastballs a little over half of the time to all hitters, adding the occasional two-seamer. Against righties, he'll also turn to his slider in all counts, while against lefties, he saves it for when he's ahead in the count or has two strikes, mixing in changeups instead in other counts.

All things considered, that's pretty good, since he's struck out only seven and walked just as many over that span. Gonzalez's FIP frightens me, folks. Like Chen, he's perhaps had some tough luck with home runs (13.5% HR/FB, 4.65 xFIP), but a lot of his apparent success this year is in his well-above-average strand rate (81.9% LOB).    After suffering some lower back issues and starting off the season in Toronto's bullpen, Happ's been a fairly typical back-end starter. His numbers aren't great, and he averages less than six innings per start, but he's stuck in the rotation since early May. The Orioles saw him back in June and managed only one run over six innings. Happ throws lots of fastballs, mostly four-seamers, but some sinkers and cutters, too. Fellow lefties see offspeed stuff just 10% of the time, and while righties see changeups more often, Happ still throws over 75% fastballs to them.

Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsThe elements of success for the Baltimore Orioles baseball team are to daily provide sufficient pitching, relentless offense, and stellar defense. Putting all three of those elements together on one evening has been the challenge for the 2014 Birds. Though the defense seldom breaks down, often the hitting or pitching struggles to hold up their end of the deal.But it all came together on Tuesday even in Toronto where the Orioles opened a critical three-game series against the second place Blue Jays, scoring a 9-3 victory.Though Bud Norris was not at the top of his game, he held the Jays to two runs in 5.1 innings of work. The bullpen allowed only one additional score in their 3.2 frames. Every batter in the Orioles lineup contributed with a hit, including three home runs; and the defense bailed out the pitchers with double plays at critical moments on three occasions.Add it all together and you have a classic Baltimore Orioles type of win.The Jays scored their two runs off of Norris with a home run by Colby Rasmus \xe2\x80\x93 a rather ordinary baseball player who somehow seems to hit the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching pretty well. But the two runs were offset by solo blasts from Caleb Joseph and Jonathan Schoop on two of the prettiest swings you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever see. \xc2\xa0 Even Cruz and Davis contributed \xe2\x80\x93 that is how well this game went for the Orioles!And to summarize here with a sentence unimaginable at the beginning of the season: The Orioles had the offense cooking so well that even Nelson Cruz and Chris Davis had a pair of RBIs each \xe2\x80\xa6 both plating runs with sac flies. Chris Davis also powered a long home run, while Cruz finally caught a break with a ground single slicing through the infield.Delmon Young justified his inclusion in the cleanup spot by getting a pair of hits and two walks in his five at-bats. Also having two hits on the evening for the Orioles were Schoop, Nick Markakis, Adam Jones, and J.J. Hardy \xe2\x80\x93 who drove in the first run with a long double.All totaled, the Orioles tallied 14 hits and eight walks over the game. Even so, the Jays put up 12 hits and never went down 1-2-3 for the entire contest.The victory opens up a five-game lead over Toronto in the standings. If the Orioles could take the next two games, along with the Jays actually being six games behind in the loss column, it could put a severe beating upon the hopes of Toronto realistically being able to catch the O\xe2\x80\x99s.The pesky Yankees, who may well get Masahiro Tanaka back this season, also lost a game in the standings by dropping a 12-inning affair to the Tigers \xe2\x80\xa6 so they are six games behind.Game two of the series will have Wei-Yin Chen (12-3, 3.76) squaring off against Drew Hutchinson (7-9, 4.62).Chen has been pitching some of the best baseball that Orioles fans have seen from him over his three years in Baltimore. Hutchinson, on the other hand, is 3-6 with a 6.22 ERA over his past 10 games. However, one of those three wins was over the Orioles where he shut them out through seven full innings.

Again just to show that baseball is truly about results more than anything else and that perception can often times be off, one would tend to think that Norris was leaps and bounds better than Gausman on the previous night.Yet Gausman was credited with a quality start because he pitched longer into the game. But the only stat that really matters is that both pitchers and the team were credited with wins.The Birds left a small army on base in the first two innings, including leaving the bases loaded in the first. However just as suddenly as they appeared on the previous night in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital, we saw Oriole bats show up north of our borders. With the O\xe2\x80\x99s already leading 1-0 on a J.J. Hardy RBI-double, Caleb Joseph hit his second homer in as many nights in the fourth. That was followed by an immediate Jonathan Schoop home run, and Delmon Young would add an RBI-single later in the inning and the O\xe2\x80\x99s led 4-0.Colby Rasmus would get some runs back for Toronto with a two-run homer, just in effect to remind the Orioles that this was a pennant race. However unfortunately for them someone forgot to remind Toronto of that as well. Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x98 bat got back on track with a solo homer of his own, in the sixth Nelson Cruz singled Manny Machado home to put the Orioles ahead 6-2.Toronto did threaten to spoil the party in the seventh when they loaded the bases with nobody out. Tommy Hunter induced Jose Bautista into a sac fly-RBI, and he then pitching the Orioles into a tailor-made double-play which ended the inning. That ended up being the climactic moment of the night for the Birds, and possibly the anti-climactic moment forCourtesy of Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsToronto. It was sink or swim time \xe2\x80\x93 and the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen chose the former.Just for good measure, the Orioles loaded the bases themselves in the top of the eighth. They got that surrendered run back on Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI, however Adam Jones and Delmon Young also were both able to move into scoring position. J.J. Hardy singled both runners home, capping off the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 9-3 victory north of the border. And for the record, this was a victory in which every player in the order had a base hit, and six of the nine batters had an RBI. Top to bottom, that\xe2\x80\x99s as balanced as you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get.The O\xe2\x80\x99s also blew through five different Toronto relievers, as starter Mark Buehrle only was able to go four innings. That bodes well for the O\xe2\x80\x99s for the remaining two games this series. We also saw Andrew Miller allow a couple of base runners but ultimately get through the eighth inning. The trade for Miller might well be one of the more unsung aspects of this season. The bullpen was already solid, but the acquisition of Miller made them\xe2\x80\xa6whatever the next thing after solid is!The series continues tonight from Rogers Centre with Wei-Yin Chen taking to the bump for the O\xe2\x80\x99s.

When they are hitting, they will leave you shaking your head in wonder. When they aren't hitting, they will also leave you shaking your head in wonder. On Wednesday night in Toronto, it was the futile kind of head-shaking, as they mustered one lone hit against the immortal Drew Hutchison in a 5-1 loss to the Blue Jays.    It was an even more futile thing than it sounds, because not only did they manage only one hit, they had only one walk. Their lone baserunner in the entire game prior to the ninth inning never even stayed on base: Chris Davis crushed an impressive opposite field blast in the second inning for his 19th home run of the year. If he could swing like that every time, he'd be back on the way to 50+ home runs. The rest of the team spent the night stinking up the joint. There's not much better of a way to put it. After the Davis home run, Hutchison retired the next 22 batters he faced, all the way through until there were two outs in the ninth inning and he walked Nick Markakis. With Hutchison at a season-high 115 pitches thrown, Jays manager John Gibbons opted for caution over the complete game, bringing on Casey Janssen for the game's final out. Hutchison entered the night with a 7.71 ERA in his home starts, a 4.62 ERA on the year in total. He was averaging fewer than six innings per start for the year, giving up three walks per nine innings. He had only turned in seven quality starts out of 22 games started. Unfortunately, three of those starts have come against the Orioles, and in throwing a near-complete game against them Wednesday, he added a fourth. It was a sad and pathetic effort as they sought to win their fourth straight game.    They needed some offense. Orioles starter Wei-Yin Chen did not have a good night on the carpet. The Rogers Centre carpet was part of the reason why, as a series of fast grounders just out of the reach of Orioles fielders led to four hits and two runs in the bottom of the first inning. The O's were down 2-0 just like that, although at least Chen managed to strike out the pesky Munenori Kawasaki with the bases loaded to hold the damage there.    That first inning was bad BABIP luck in a place that's designed for such. The second inning, well, there wasn't much bad luck about Jose Bautista launching a two-run home run halfway up into the second deck in left field. He must have gotten the right signal from the man in white for that pitch. No, not really. Well, maybe. Who knows with that shady cast of characters. Either way, it was Bautista's 22nd home run of the season. He finished off the night a triple short of the cycle. Chen ended up with a five and dive, giving up four runs on eight hits and two walks in his five innings. He struck out six, which will never win you many awards, but there are nights where it can be good enough for the team to win. Either of the last two games, it would have been good enough, in fact. Chen had the misfortune to start on the night when the Orioles hitters folded up the tents after their outburst the last two games. Chen took the loss to fall to 12-4 on the season, with Hutchison's win raising his record to 8-9.    The Jays hit 5-11 with runners in scoring position for the game. That's a good way to scratch out five runs. The Orioles never had an at-bat with a runner in scoring position all night, and did not have an at-bat with a man on base until the game's final batter. If they were facing a Cy Young-caliber pitcher, this would make sense. But Hutchison? What is this team's deal? A 0.98 ERA in four starts! He has a 5.30 ERA against the whole rest of baseball. The Orioles might be single-handedly saving Hutchison from banishment to the minor leagues. Not much to be done except show up and try to do better tomorrow. Maybe they'll hit better, maybe they'll pitch better. Maybe they'll do both. Their lead has shrunk to four games in the AL East after this loss to their closest competitor.    In Thursday's rubber game, the Orioles will send Miguel Gonzalez onto the carpet against Toronto's J.A. Happ. A win will bring them back up to a five game lead. A loss in the game and series would see the division lead shrink back down to three games. Better up by three than down by three, but even better up by five.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

But when the Orioles celebrate their 60th anniversary with a full day of nostalgia-packed events Friday, they will be able to pay tribute to the team\'s storied past at a time when the Oriole Way is no longer just a historical footnote for a new generation of fans.The Orioles are in first place in the American League East, and they got there by doing the same things that made them the most successful team in the major leagues during the franchise\'s golden years. They have re-established a tradition of strong fundamental baseball and top-to-bottom organizational development. var adSkipCounter = 0; Thank Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette for that, and don\'t forget Andy MacPhail, who took a lot of heat while he was doing the dirty work of re-establishing a coherent front office blueprint after a decade of dysfunction.Maybe this isn\'t exactly your grandfather\'s Oriole Way, but there is certainly a strong resemblance.""It looks a lot like it,"" said Boog Powell, who will be among the 23 Orioles greats introduced during a glitzy postgame laser light and fireworks show after the Orioles open a three-game interleague series against the St. Louis Cardinals on Friday night. ""We were missing something during all those years when we weren\'t in contention.""Powell is in a position to know. He was there when the Orioles went to the World Series four times in six years (1966-71), and he\'s still around the team on a daily basis, running his famous barbeque stand. This incarnation of the Orioles doesn\'t have four 20-game winners, but he sees plenty that reminds him of the terrific teams of the past.""It\'s great,"" he said, ""but it does make me nervous when they play so many close games. I know how that feels. We played a lot of close ballgames, but we didn\'t worry about it. We knew we were going to win.""This Orioles team exudes the same confidence, thanks largely to an airtight bullpen and a defense that set major league records last year for fewest errors, most errorless games and highest fielding percentage. The starting pitching has come together at midseason, and Earl Weaver wouldn\'t complain about an offense that entered Thursday\'s series finale in Toronto leading the major leagues in home runs.""Buck and Dan Duquette have just revitalized the entire organization,"" said Rick Dempsey, who was named World Series Most Valuable Player after the Orioles won their last title in 1983. ""The hands-on approach Buck has had has put the organization back on the map.""I think we had lost a lot of credibility, but we\'re moving back in the right direction, developing young players inside the organization and finding players that are good all-around players, not just hitters.""The celebration also will include a sold-out luncheon honoring members of the Orioles Hall of Fame and a pregame tribute to the Oriole Advocates and fans who have had season-ticket plans since the inaugural Orioles season in 1954.Obviously, it\'s no coincidence that the 60th anniversary observance is taking place while the St. Louis Cardinals are in town, since it was the old St. Louis Browns that moved to Baltimore 60 years ago to renew the city\'s love-affair with major league baseball that dates back to the 19th century.The Oriole Way doesn\'t go back quite that far. It started in the 1950s with general manager and manager Paul Richards, who insisted on a standardized instruction program throughout the relocated organization and placed a strong emphasis on pitching development. Many of the great players who will be honored Friday learned the fundamental aspect in the minor leagues from Cal Ripken Sr., who was a stickler for perfect practice and execution.""There was one way to do it all the way through the system,"" Powell said. ""When you got here to the big leagues, everyone knew all the same cutoff plays \xe2\x80\xa6 they knew the way we expected thing to be done. So, when a Bobby Grich or a Don Baylor came up, they had no problem making the adjustment, except adapting to big league pitching. Those things you didn\'t have to worry about.""Sound familiar? Showalter has made a practice throughout his managerial tenure of keeping in very close contact with the minor league managers and coaches, and that has been reflected in the seamless way players have shuttled back and forth between the major and minor leagues.Dempsey also sees similarity in the way Weaver embraced new ideas and the way Showalter seems to be constantly looking for new ways to put the Orioles in the best possible position to win.""I think back then everybody looked at the Baltimore Orioles for the innovative ways to approach major league baseball,"" Dempsey said. ""All of the sudden, we lost that, and now it\'s back again.""peter.schmuck@baltsun.comtwitter.com/SchmuckStopRead more from columnist Peter Schmuck on his blog, ""The Schmuck Stops Here,"" at baltimoresun.com/schmuckblog.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldPriest at once defended, excoriated1969 slayings of 2 women forge police-FBI liaisonA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

New information has surfaced as part of a broadcaster\'s emergency motion for injunctive relief\xc2\xa0 to prevent the Nationals from terminating baseball game telecast rights.To quickly review what\'s happened until Thursday\'s intervention by a New York judge, when the Montreal Expos became the Washington Nationals in 2005, Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos was upset at the prospect of having another team in his region. So a deal was worked out whereby the Orioles would hold a majority partnership profit interest in Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN), which would get to to telecast Nationals games at a substantial discount from 2005 until 2011. After that, MASN would be obligated to pay ""fair market value.""The parties went to arbitration to determine that ""fair market value."" According to new documents surfacing, the Nationals demanded $118 million a year from 2012 to 2016. The Orioles-controlled broadcaster thought fees starting at $34 million and rising to $45.7 million was more appropriate. On June 30, a MLB committee privately adjudicating the dispute issued a decision favoring the Nationals.The broadcaster refused to pay, though, leading the Nationals to send notice of default, and MLB commissioner Bud Selig threatening to ""impose the strongest sanctions available"" if the parties went to court. Despite the warnings, the teams and their broadcasters filed papers in New York state court. MLB was one of the named respondents. The court action came after the Orioles told MLB it would be seeking no less than $800 million in lost asset value, according to a letter obtained by THR.After our story went public, a MASN spokesperson attempted to calm nerves by issuing a statement that read in part, ""Our loyal viewers should understand this is a business dispute and will have no impact on the telecast of the Clubs&rsquo games.""But things were certainly less settled with a default notice being floated. MASN\'s emergency motion made this explicitly clear. The broadcaster\'s court papers warned of the irreparable harm that would follow if the Nationals pulled its games:""MASN\'s primary and essential programming -- the telecast and distribution of the Nationals\' and Orioles\' games -- can not be replaced. MASN immediately would be in breach of nearly 30 affiliate agreements for the distribution of Nationals\' games and with advertisers and sponsors who have brought time for their products during Nationals\' telecasts. MASN\'s exclusive right to telecast the games of two MLB clubs (the Orioles and the Nationals) within the same geographical television territory would be forever lost.""The broadcaster\'s memo also revealed something else not commonly known about the arrangement worked out inside the sanctum of professional baseball. If the Nationals got a hefty increase in the amount of TV fees, MASN would be contractually required to pay ""the same rights fees"" to the Orioles. And because of MLB\'s revenue sharing agreement, the Orioles would then have to pay over up to 34 percent of that amount to the league.In other words, giving the Nationals more money not only represents less profits to the Orioles, but as the Orioles view it, a ""tax,"" which explains why Angelos is willing to defy Selig\'s order and litigate the issue. MASN also believes it can\'t afford this outcome. There\'s less-than-subtle hints that the dispute could blow up the broadcaster\'s business, leaving Orioles and Nationals telecasts in some grey zone.The basis for why MASN believes the arbitration award should be vacated is two-fold.First, the broadcaster points to a clause in a settlement agreement that allegedly sets forth a specific methodology to determine the fair market value of telecast right fees. The formula was developed by MLB consultant Bortz Media & Sports Group. During the arbitration, though, a panel comprised of the chief operating officer of the New York Mets, the president of the Pittsburgh Pirates and the owner of the Tampa Bay Rays is said to have abandoned that formula for another, ""thereby diverting MASN\'s profits to the Nationals and MLB and reducing MASN to an economically unsustainable 5 percent profit margin,"" according to the emergency motion.Read MoreSecond, the broadcaster challenges the impartiality of the arbitrators, and in court papers that bring up such things as MLB giving the Mets $25 million to deal with a cash shortfall after team owners did business with Bernard Madoff, accuses the league of ""corruption"" and ""fraud."" According to the broadcaster\'s papers:""At the time of the sale, MLB informed the purchasers that despite the terms of the Settlement Agreement, MLB would use its power over the arbitral process to control the determination of the Nationals\' telecast rights fees and thereby restructure the economics of MASN to the Nationals\' benefit. MLB made these promises to secure a high price for the team and, indeed, MLB received a $340 million windfall when it sold the Nationals. At the very first opportunity to reset the telecast rights fees, MLB effectuated the scheme; it instructed the [Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee] to depart from the Settlement Agreement\'s charge to use the RSDC\'s established methodology. In a telling moment during the merits hearing, the Nationals\' counsel stated the Nationals have been \'waiting seven years to get our rights back.\'""The Nationals filed its own legal papers in response to the emergency motion, which it paints as an attempt to ""trample"" and ""eviscerate"" its bargained-for termination rights and threaten the ""balance of power between the Orioles, as majority partner, and the Nationals"" as minority partner.""The team also argued that it was within the Commissioner\'s powers to order MASN to pay the Nationals, and as for harm, the team referenced its payroll. The team spends nearly $135 million on players -- ninth most in the league. If the judge grants the broadcaster\'s request, the team warns it ""would be forced to make arrangements to finance their ongoing operations and salary obligations, notwithstanding that the Nationals are entitled to meet cash flow needs through the rights fee payments the Agreement requires.""A New York judge has now ordered respondents including Commissioner Selig to show cause why a temporary restraining order shouldn\'t be issued, and in the interim, has restrained the Nationals and MLB from taking any action to terminate MASN\'s license to telecast Nationals games. It might be the first time that MLB has been enjoined by a club. The case continues as this is only the early innings.Email: Eriq.Gardner@THR.com> Twitter: @eriqgardner ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Wei-Yin Chen or Chris Tillman, any Ace?', 'Aug 1, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter (26) takes the ball from starting pitcher Wei-Yin Chen (16) in the eighth inning against the Seattle Mariners at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles defeated the Mariners 2-1. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching has done very well recently, and it begs the question: do the Orioles have an ace?Chris Tillman was the media-named ace without hesitation at the beginning of the season, but he has not lived up to such a name.He leads the team in innings pitched with 143. He has an 8-5 record with a 3.78 ERA. Tillman has allowed the most walks on the team next to Ubaldo Jimenez.Tillman has not been the best pitcher, but he has also had his good starts. However, there is nothing in his pitching arsenal that defines him as an ace. He has no regular consistency.

A true ace defends his home field.You could argue that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 less than stellar offense at home is the reason for the poor record, which is certainly a reason. The offense gives Tillman 2.78 runs on average per start at home.There is one common trait between the pitchers whether they receive four runs per game at home or less than four. They are able to pitch with the offense to help the team win games.Tillman has a 6-0 record on the road with a 4.68 ERA, but he receives over five runs per start away from Baltimore.Tillman is a pitcher who pitches quite well with run support, but if the run support goes away, he suffers. A true ace does not suffer in this situation, and I think it is clear by now, Tillman is not the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 ace.Unless he drastically changes the way he pitches, Tillman does not have the ability to be an ace. However, he will have his good starts and his bad ones.Wei-Yin Chen is another story. He was never expected to be an ace.He is having a fantastic year with a 12-4 record and 3.90 ERA, with 90+ strikeouts and less than 25 walks on the season.Chen has a 6-2 record at home with a 3.65 ERA and receives 4.50 runs per home start.His record reflects the high run support, which allows him to retain a higher ERA and still win 12 games. In 10 road starts, he receives over six runs per game, which he used to produce a 6-2 record with a 4.23 ERA.Chen may have an impressive record, but he pitches much like Tillman. When he receives offense, he wins.In Chen\xe2\x80\x99s four losses, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense scored a mere nine runs.This can very much be true of any pitcher, but when it comes to an ace, the offense\xe2\x80\x99s runs do not matter. On the top end of the spectrum, Clayton Kershaw can win games when his team only scores three runs.He pitches very well, as he is a proven ace, with a low ERA that could set records this season.As of this season, I would define an ace as Kershaw. Clearly, when in comparison to him, neither Chen nor Tillman match up well as an ace.Though it may not be the ideal answer for some people, I have to hold to the stance that the Orioles do not have an ace.Despite the demand for Tillman to be the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 ace and Chen\xe2\x80\x99s excellent stats, I cannot bring myself to proclaim an Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitcher the ace of the staff. As you will see below, I would not even put Tillman as the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 second best starter.The Orioles have good and bad pitchers, but none of them excels enough to be titled an ace.But I can rank the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters:Wei-Yin Chen (3.90 ERA)Bud Norris (3.68 ERA)Chris Tillman (3.78 ERA)Kevin Gausman (3.77 ERA)Miguel Gonzalez (3.93 ERA)Ubaldo Jimenez (4.52 ERA)Do not mistake this list as Chen being the ace; while I do believe he is the best starter for the Orioles, I do not believe him to be the ace of the staff.Some people think there is one ace per rotation, but I believe aces are not that common. The Orioles just happen to be a team without an ace. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('MASN Fee Dispute: Orioles get initial court victory ...', ' A week ago, when the news broke that the Orioles, through the proxy of MASN, were headed to court over their dispute with the Nationals regarding rights fees, there was also an indication that baseball commissioner Bud Selig sternly warned all parties that he would take the ""strongest sanctions available"" against any party initiating a lawsuit.    If Selig thought he was going to scare Orioles owner Peter Angelos out of suing to get an outcome that Angelos thinks he deserves, it brings to mind a classic Bugs Bunny cartoon: ""He don\'t know me very well, do he?"" Eric Fisher of the Sports Business Journal\xc2\xa0reported on Twitter that MASN has received a temporary restraining order in New York State Supreme Court (which is not, despite its name, the highest court in New York) against the initial arbitration decision handed down by an MLB panel. That is pending the result of a hearing to be held later this month, according to Fisher. It\'s no guarantee that they will win the later hearing, but MLB would have preferred the suit to be dismissed entirely, so the fact that things are moving on is a blow to Selig. No one has ever done this before, so no one can be sure what is going to happen as a result. The genesis of the dispute lies in the favorable terms given to Angelos in creating a regional TV network as part of the agreement that he would allow the then-Montreal Expos to take up residence in Orioles territory. To offset the lost revenue from that second franchise in the territory, the Orioles were given a significant stake in the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network, declining by 1% per year until they would eventually have a 66% stake. That\'s not for another 20 years - the Orioles currently have an 86% stake in MASN.    That initial settlement, according to last week\'s Hollywood Reporter story, provided that the Nationals would have their rights fee set at ""fair market value"" in 2012. MASN - that is, the Orioles, who own most of it - has been keeping that fee lower than it should have been, according to the Nationals. They argue it\'s significantly lower, in fact:\xc2\xa0a Washington Post article from 2013 indicated that the Nationals would receive a $37 million rights fee for that year. The Nationals are seeking a rights fee in the range of $100-120 million, which could triple the amount they currently get. In the current contract, according to the Post, the Orioles are to be paid the same rights fee as the Nationals. So what\'s the problem? If the Nationals make $70 million more, so do the Orioles. That sounds pretty good. The answer to that lies in the ownership stake. If money from MASN\'s current profit has to go to paying the Nationals, that\'s less money that the O\'s get from their stake in the network. If the Orioles were getting 86% of that $70 million that could go to the Nationals, that\'s nearly $60 million per year less in the Orioles coffers. A secret MLB arbitration panel consisting of one representative each from the Rays, Pirates, and Mets had previously ruled in favor of the Nationals wanting more money, which MASN has refused to pay to this point. In the Hollywood Reporter story, a lawyer for MASN was quoted in a letter indicating the arbitration panel had a ""lack of procedural fairness"" and that it was not binding on the Orioles.    It\'s all very complicated, and now it\'s in court, which is where people get paid a lot of money to argue such complicated things. Maybe the Orioles are in the right as far as the law is concerned, in which case they will win. Maybe the Nationals are in the right, in which case the Orioles will lose. Maybe now that the Orioles have demonstrated they are willing to go to court and have won the preliminary hearing for an injunction on the arbitration award, they will secure a more favorable settlement from MLB in order to drop the pending case before the court. Selig has failed to keep the matter out of court. That\'s too bad for him. It could end up being good news for the Orioles.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

One of those perks was the ability to take in the lion\'s share of the region\'s television revenues. Both parties agreed to this.    Yet MLB never planned for this deal to last for long. They communicated to prospective buyers of the Nationals franchise that the television revenue would be redistributed in spite of the prior agreement with the Orioles. Major League Baseball has been planning for years to go back on this sweetheart deal now that it\'s no longer convenient for them. At least, that\'s what MASN has to say about it,\xc2\xa0charging in a petition to a New York Supreme Court that baseball engaged in a scheme that ""knowingly and intentionally deprives MASN and the Orioles of their promised compensation, assets, and rights."" This petition was filed despite the threats of baseball commissioner Bud Selig to levy the\xc2\xa0""strongest sanctions available"" should a franchise take this dispute to court. The intent of the petition is for the court to vacate a recent arbitration decision that decreed that MASN should pay between $60-90 million in additional rights fees to the Nationals per year. In essence, Selig is playing the part of Darth Vader in\xc2\xa0saying to the Orioles, ""I am altering the deal. Pray I don\'t alter it any further.""    Note that, despite what it seems like, this court case is not Orioles owner Peter Angelos suing Selig in open court. The petitioner in the case is TCR Sports Broadcasting Holding, LLP, which does business as the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. It was news to me that MASN isn\'t really MASN, too.    Of course, the Orioles - that is, the Baltimore Orioles Limited Partnership - own 85% of the network, so it\'s safe to say that MASN would not be suing the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball nor the Commissioner of Major League Baseball if O\'s majority partner Angelos did not wish it so. Still, Angelos himself isn\'t filing suit or going to court, funny as it would be to picture it. MASN is represented in the case by the New York law firm of Chadbourne & Parke LLP. They are based in the famous 30 Rockefeller Plaza building. The lead attorney on the petition is Mr. Thomas J. Hall, co-head of the firm\'s commercial litigation practice,\xc2\xa0whose biography boasts of 40 trials to verdict and arbitrations to award. Well, that sounds impressive enough.    How did things get to where MASN was filing suit against Baseball? In the original agreement between the Orioles and Baseball, the television rights fees for the nascent Nationals franchise would be set by MASN until 2012, at which time the Nationals fees would be adjusted to ""fair market value."" The Orioles would further receive the same amount of fees as whatever the Nationals would receive in any agreement. When the time came to determine that market value, MASN secured the services of the Bortz Media & Sports Group, which, according to the petition, has set the value of any disputed television contract for the last decade and a half. By their agreement, baseball\'s committee - the Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee (RSDC) - is required to use this methodology to render any rulings. In 2012, MASN proposed a $34 million rights fee, set to increase by 7.7 percent annually,\xc2\xa0according to the Washington Post. If that has continued to be the case, they would be getting about $40 million this year.    The Nationals objected to this plan, believing they were entitled to $100-120 million in rights fees. This dispute went to the RSDC, which was made up of one representative of ownership each from the Rays, Pirates, and Mets. Despite being required to use the Bortz methodology, which MASN had already consulted, the committee ruled in June, as we only found out a week ago, in favor of the Nationals. MASN\'s petition charges that the arbitration panel acted outside the scope of its authority granted in the Settlement Agreement. This is how refer to the deal that let the Nationals set up shop in Orioles territory in the first place. The Orioles agreed that the Expos could settle in their territory. Further, the petition charges that the RSDC panel was impossibly tainted by a conflict of interest. An increase in the rights fees for the Orioles and Nationals means that more money goes into the revenue sharing pool. Baseball collects 34% of local television revenues as a tax to put in the revenue sharing pool. Profits from an ownership stake in a network - which the Orioles have enjoyed explicitly as a compensation for losing sole access to their territory - are not taxed in this way. Both the Rays and Pirates are franchises who receive revenue sharing money. The petition also charges that the Chairman of the panel made statements during the hearing confirming an interest in receiving more revenue sharing money. Even beyond this, there is the argument made in the petition that Baseball had a financial stake in the outcome of the arbitration, as it had privately given the Nationals money, secured from a third party loan, in both 2012 and 2013 in advance of an expected windfall when the arbitration case was handed down. Therefore, Baseball, which convened the committee, as well as two of the three committee members, stood to benefit financially from a ruling in favor of the Nationals. The panel in essence began with an outcome pre-determined - which was disadvantageous to the Orioles - and did everything to live up to that outcome.    Or at least, that\'s what MASN argues. The New York judge who received the petition felt it had enough merit to issue a temporary restraining order against either Baseball or the Nationals doing anything to enforce the award from this arbitration panel. The Nationals had been arguing for Selig to declare the Orioles in default for payments they were supposed to make according to this biased arbitration panel. MASN wants a new arbitration hearing with an unbiased panel that will act according to the terms of the Settlement Agreement. A full hearing on the matter of an injunction will be held later in August, and if things escalate beyond that, a trial will be set for an undetermined later time. It\'s not just conjecture by MASN that the RSDC ignored the Bortz methodology. The Managing Director of Bortz stated in an affidavit that the RSDC ""improperly ignored facts and intentionally ignored other applicable reports that applied the established methodology"" - all in order to find in favor of the Nationals, which, as far as MASN/the Orioles are concerned, it had planned to do for years, going back to when MLB was selling the Nationals franchise. One way that the RSDC juked numbers to rule in the Nationals\' favor, MASN lays out in its petition, is that the RSDC considered as a baseline numbers from the 2007 season, which, as the first year of MASN\'s existence, are not representative of how it has performed in any year since and particularly not in the present. In 2007, MASN had a 5% profit margin; since, it has run on a 20% profit margin, which is, according to Bortz, the industry norm. That 20% profit margin has been applied in every single other case except for this dispute and is considered a reasonable profit. The RSDC used these 2007 numbers to justify ruling that a 5% profit margin was reasonable for MASN going forward despite the fact that it had never done so before, and was expressly bound in the Settlement Agreement to use the Bortz methodology.    By shifting money from MASN profits to the rights fees, the Orioles suffer in two ways. One, they lose the 85% of money that they would have collected from what would be shifted to the Nationals rights fees. Two, they would lose 34% of money shifted to their own rights fees as part of the revenue sharing tax. If the result of the arbitration is that both the Orioles and Nationals make $60 million more in rights fees, that\'s potentially $71 million annually that now goes to the Orioles that would be lost if this arbitration award is forced upon them. There is a further question of whether MASN could even continue to exist in its current form if it was forced to have another $120 million in expenses over what it now possesses. It seems unlikely that it could. Baseball and the Orioles made a deal when the Expos came to town. Baseball no longer likes the deal and is trying to finagle out of it. One wonders if Selig arranged things so he could buy Angelos\' cooperation for a few years, only to turn around and take him to the woodshed later. If so, he forgot who he was dealing with. Now, Angelos, through the MASN entity, has taken Baseball to court to protect the 2005 agreement. This is a man who won a multi-billion dollar settlement from tobacco companies. He\'s probably not afraid of whatever baseball can throw at him. Whether this all will go to a trial is not even a sure thing. The trial will not be under seal, which means that any documents introduced about the finances of baseball or its individual teams, would be open record. Baseball has fought very hard to avoid ever doing this, probably because then the players will see how much money the teams are hiding with sleight of hand. It could be that now that MASN is on the path to a trial, Baseball will suddenly be much more conciliatory in trying to broker a settlement, rather than trying to force them into a disadvantageous award from a biased arbitration panel. Baseball could beat MASN/the Orioles and still lose in the long run if the players are armed with more accurate information for the next round of labor negotiations.    What seems like fairness to a layperson does not always go hand in hand with what the law says. Hardball Talk\'s Craig Calcaterra, one of the many lawyer-bloggers floating around,\xc2\xa0notes how difficult it is to have a court set aside an arbitration decision, regardless of how screwed up that arbitration may have been. And the Nationals and Baseball will have their own high-powered lawyers to argue that the decision was fairly reached and, therefore, binding on MASN, who would then have to pay the Nationals a lot more money. In turn, the Orioles would in turn receive a lot less money. Of course, the whole agreement was constructed to be unfair to the Nationals to begin with, offsetting the unfairness of the Orioles losing the sole access to its own territory. Without the initial agreement being advantageous for the Orioles, Angelos would have gone to court when the Expos came to town. This agreement was the price of his silence. Little surprise that now that baseball no longer wants to kick in that money that Angelos is no longer silent about it. It\'s impossible to know what will happen next because nothing like this has ever happened before, with a team waging a court battle by proxy against another team and the league in general. Uncertainty over the outcome of this process could go a long way to explaining why the Orioles have been more cautious with payroll than outside observers think they should be. With tens of millions of dollars of annual revenue potentially going up in smoke, they simply don\'t know what they\'ll be working with in five or even two years. Until then, we wait. On the field, outside of any of these legal concerns, the 2014 Orioles have played their way to a five game lead in the American League East. The future may hold any number of problems, but for today, things are looking pretty good. The rest is up to a New York judge.

They lost Albert Pujols and didn\'t even care. They get competitive balance draft picks despite being one of the consistently good teams of the last decade. They\'ve temporarily fallen into second place in the NL Central, and the Orioles are in the way of their getting back to what they probably see as their rightful perch.

Which, so far this year, Masterson has sucked. But why has he sucked? The Ubaldo-esque walk rate certainly is a part of why, although you know that won\'t hurt him against a team like the Orioles, who doesn\'t walk. How does a guy getting nearly 60% ground balls have a .351 BABIP? Is Cleveland\'s infield just that bad? If so, he could experience a reversal of fortunes in a Cardinals uniform, which would also not be unexpected due to the aforementioned hidden Satanic magic.

The Orioles won 12-2. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe night of August 8, 2014 will be and evening that goes down in Baltimore Orioles lore as one of the most wonderful and magical events in franchise history. A packed house at Camden Yards saw the O\xe2\x80\x99s blast six home runs on the way to a 12-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Next followed an incredible multimedia show and tribute to the 60 years of baseball in Baltimore.I am not an easily-impressed guy. For example, I drove up to Mount Rushmore a few years ago, got out of the car and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it? That\xe2\x80\x99s as big as it gets?\xe2\x80\x9d I expected somewhat WAY bigger. It was a great disappointment.In fact, much of the beauty of the West is lost on me, and I agree with the quote from the famous movie \xe2\x80\x9cDumb and Dumber\xe2\x80\x9d about the Rocky Mountains\xe2\x80\xa6Harry Dunne: I expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little rockier than this.Lloyd Christmas: I was thinking the same thing. That John Denver\xe2\x80\x99s full of crap, man.All to say, I\xe2\x80\x99m not often blown away by exceeded expectations, but the tribute show after the ballgame was absolutely incredible. The warehouse was used as a backdrop screen for projection with some phenomenally amazing graphics and video. The text for the program was perfect and the soundtrack simply awesome!Thank you, #Birdland for making our 60th Anniversary Celebration so special. #Orioles60 pic.twitter.com/5JYNcsHzRS\xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) August 9, 2014Baltimore Orioles players from the past 60 years were brought to the field one by one as memories were re-lived by many \xe2\x80\xa6 well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many remember all of them, but, I do!It all began with Milt Pappas \xe2\x80\xa6 tonight, and \xe2\x80\xa6..The day was May 2, 1964 and I was in 3rd grade. It was my first big-league ballgame and Pappas was the starting pitcher. I was amazed by the spectacle of it all, and even though the O\xe2\x80\x99s lost that game to the Indians in 13 innings, a love was born in me and I was hooked for life.Over the years, every one of those honored tonight I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen play in Baltimore, including being at the 4th and final game of the 1966 World Series, won by the Orioles 1-0 on a Frank Robinson home run. I was pretty far away by the right field foul pole to see the homer particularly well, but the seats were perfect for watching Paul Blair bring a Dodgers home run ball back into the park with a grand leap at the center-field wall.I saw Don Buford hit that opening home run in the \xe2\x80\x9969 Series and then died within when the Mets won it all.But a year later, I skipped out of my high school cross country practice after school to go to the one office in the building that had a little TV so that I could see the Orioles beat the Reds in the final game on a weekday afternoon. I got in lots of trouble with the coach, but it was worth it.So the entire show was a trip down my personal memory lane of baseball, and it has been a great ride with the Baltimore Orioles \xe2\x80\xa6 capped on this day by a magical evening.And it is a joy to come on here daily with you friends in what is for me, I presume, nearing the final innings of my personal game, and to share my thoughts and perspectives. Some days there are hundreds of you, sometimes there are a few thousand, but in any event it is a privilege that I trust gives you even a fraction of the joy it provides me in writing about it.Buck Showalter expressed his hopes earlier in the day that the team would put on a show worthy of the occasion. Check! Imagine being an Orioles player like Brad Brach or Jonathan Schoop \xe2\x80\x93 coming out on the field at the end of the celebration to mingle with the greats of the past, including multiple Hall-of-Famers. Awesome indeed!And I wondered too what it must have been like to be one of the Cardinals \xe2\x80\x93 after getting totally pasted, and then being in the locker room with the stadium shaking from the crowds, the fireworks, and the show. It might have been akin to being a Parthian warrior captured by the Romans, awaiting from within the bowels of the Coliseum for your turn with the lions in the arena.Okay \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe that was a bit over the top as a picture, but it was a great night and show in every way. I hope you all got to see it either in person or on MASN. If not, I am sure it will be shown again, perhaps for years to come.Go O\xe2\x80\x99s.Aug 8, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles right fielder Steve Pearce (28) catches a pop-up by St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Mark Ellis (not pictured) in the seventh inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

The Baltimore Ravens and Baltimore Orioles and Otakon all wrapped into a large, strange bundle.First let me explain that I did not attend Otakon. Otakon is the long-running\xc2\xa0anime convention held at the Baltimore Convention Center in Baltimore and is\xc2\xa0the 2nd largest North American anime convention. But since I parked near the Inner Harbor both nights I walked past many Otakon participants, as well as shared a happy hour bar experience with a few of them. I am not a huge anime fan, but enjoy watching their sub-culture at play. I am happy when anyone embraces the things they enjoy, even if it is not something I would do. One of my favorite television shows ever is Doctor Who, so I think it is safe I should never make fun of anyone else.But the Otakon crowd certainly made an interesting clash with the Orioles and Ravens fans\xc2\xa0in downtown. Orange, purple,\xc2\xa0Kenshin Himura,\xc2\xa0Spike Spiegel,\xc2\xa0Vegeta,\xc2\xa0Edward Elric,\xc2\xa0Haruko Haruhara and the various characters of\xc2\xa0Hidden Village of the Mist, not to mention seemingly endless\xc2\xa0variations of Harajuku Girls, made an overwhelming visual experience for all.The Ravens game on Thursday may have only been a preseason game but the fans were treated to a newly renovated M&T Bank Stadium, as well as a newly renovated offensive output. The first-line starters only played briefly, but it was obvious that the new play calling worked well as the team moved down the field quickly and efficiently.The West Coast offense looks to be a good one for Joe Flacco and company. The updated\xc2\xa0offensive line seemed to handle the zone blocking scheme that last year\xe2\x80\x99s line could not work under, and the running backs ran well.The defense started slowly but quickly tightened up. It was obvious that C.J. Mosley became the key, as when he adapted to the pro game, the rest of the team followed suit. A\xc2\xa0third \xe2\x80\x9cHarbaugh Bowl\xe2\x80\x9d was won, with older brother John taking down his younger brother again.After a few hours of sleep, work and brief family time, it was back to downtown to say \xe2\x80\x9chi\xe2\x80\x9d to my new Otakon friends and attend the 60th Anniversary Orioles game. Well, I really never said \xe2\x80\x9chi\xe2\x80\x9d to anyone, but you get my point.The game was a blast, as the Orioles dominated the visiting St. Louis Cardinals 12-2 while hitting six home runs, including two by shortstop J. J. Hardy. The Orioles pitching limited the Cardinals offense, and Chris Tillman got his 9th win with ease. It seemed fitting that a St. Louis team played the night we celebrated the anniversary of when the hapless St. Louis Browns moved to town.The post-game multimedia celebration made the fans cheer throughout the show. Fireworks, lasers, the iconic B&O Warehouse being used as a giant projection screen, and numerous historical pictures and videos displayed on the stadium\xe2\x80\x99s HD screen showed off the amazing 60-year run of the Baltimore Orioles.The celebrated guests to witness the show were an amazing array of Orioles. Guests were: Eddie Murray, Jim Palmer, Cal Ripken Jr., Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson, Brady Anderson, Mike Bordick, Don Buford, Al Bumbry, Rick Dempsey, Chris Hoiles, Scott McGregor, Boog Powell, B.J. Surhoff, Dennis Martinez, Tippy Martinez, Ken Singleton, Doug DeCinces, Gregg Olson, Milt Pappas and Eddie Watt. Murray, Ripken, Dempsey, both Robinsons, and Powell got the biggest ovations during a night of big ovations.So will I remember the preseason victory over the 49ers? Probably not.

It was a stark contrast from the first two games of the series, when Baltimore totaled nine home runs and outscored St. Louis 22-5.Manager Buck Showalter gave credit to St. Louis starter Lance Lynn and reliever Pat Neshek, who fanned four in two perfect innings.Lynn (12-8) gave up three runs and nine hits over 5 2-3 innings.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles scored into double figures for the second consecutive day and made a winner of Ubaldo Jimenez in his return from the disabled list. The final score of 10-3 over the St. Louis Cardinals featured three home runs by O\xe2\x80\x99s batters, along with a whole lot of other support.Most any pitcher would like his chances when his team hits three long balls. Added to the six from the previous evening along with 31 total hits from the two games, the Orioles have scored 22 runs in just 16 innings. The bats are back.And the most encouraging bat to return to the hits and home runs columns is that of Nelson Cruz. Nellie certainly likes hitting off John Lackey, connecting on this day for his 30th homer of the season \xe2\x80\x93 three of them off his irritable foe. The Orioles tagged the former Red Sox pitcher for nine runs in five innings. Sweet!The only starters in the Orioles lineup to not get at least two hits were Nick Markakis with just one, and Chris Davis who was 0-for-4.What is impressive about the nine home runs is that they have been hit by eight different players. That is depth in the lineup, as Buck Showalter rightly commented after the game:\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to pass the load around,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more a pitcher has to focus on numerous guys, and not have breathing spots in the lineup \xe2\x80\xa6 Hey, let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, some guys coast a little bit through certain parts and save their bullets. The more you can keep them from doing that, it shortens their outing.\xe2\x80\x9dSpeaking of guys with a load of bullets in a clip, Caleb Joseph homered in his fifth consecutive game. An interesting storyline for Sunday afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s series finale will be to see if he can move it to six in a row.

08/11/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles\\u2019 Machado: A Man with Ugly Knees', ""Aug 11, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles third baseman Manny Machado (13) goes down with a knee injury after striking out in the third inning against the New York Yankees at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThere is so much for the fans of the Baltimore Orioles and their third baseman Manny Machado to be excited about. Most professional players his age would be working their way through the minors at about the A-level, if they were even in pro ball and out of college.He was the #3 overall pick in the 2010 draft. Though Bryce Harper was #1, the second pick (by the Pirates) was RHP Jameson Taillon, who is a career 16-21 and recovering from Tommy John surgery. And the next pick after Machado (by the Royals) was infielder Christian Colon, who has played a total of eight games in the major leagues.When have we ever seen a third baseman like this? For such a young man it is simply beyond imagination. He has the glove of Brooks Robinson, but there really is no one else with whom to compare his arm. I have never seen anything like it.He is a plus hitter, again, especially for a man his age. Machado has made such great advances this year after missing the offseason training and all of the spring up to his first appearance on May 1st. For May and June he batted .239; but for July and August it has been .348.His reflexes and eye-hand skills are simply amazing\xe2\x80\x94rare air sort of stuff. They don\xe2\x80\x99t just give away Gold Glove and Platinum Glove awards.This is a franchise cornerstone sort of player.But here is the bad news: He has ugly knees.On Monday night in Baltimore, he was essentially carried off the field with a knee injury for the second time in his short career. Of course, at the end of the 2013 season, Machado suffered a devastating knee injury on the bag at first base in Tampa Bay, resulting is major surgery.The Orioles announced Monday night that Machado suffered a sprained right knee and will be re-evaluated on Tuesday. That does not sound too bad, but the look of it at the moment it happened gave an appearance of something much worse. In a swing with a high level of torque, where it also looked like his ankle collapsed under him, he simply went down into a heap, grabbing his knee.Machado runs with a terribly awkward, knees-knocking sort of gait. Long before the first knee injury, I feared the very situation/situations that had/have developed. As a long-time running coach in cross country and track, I have to say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to offer as a suggestion for it. It is simply his natural bio-mechanical disposition. What I am really saying is that it is not a fixable sort of thing.

Well, it is not as if it has not happened before. All O\xe2\x80\x99s fans want to see him at third base and batting second in the lineup. But with Machado playing this year, they are 46-35 (.568) and without him they are a combined 21-15 (.583).Actually, since the Orioles spanked the Yankees after Machado went out of the game, they are now 47-35 with him.

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsI know what Baltimore Orioles fans are thinking \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a best time to beat the Yankees? I thought the best time was every time!\xe2\x80\x9d Well, yes, that is true. So maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll just say this is an especially best time to knock them off.Entering the three-game series with the Yankees that begins tonight at Oriole Park, the Birds have a five-game lead over the Toronto Blue Jays and a six-game lead over the New Yorkers.The Orioles are 3-6 against the Yankees this year, meaning that there are still 10 games remaining versus the Evil Empire.Though the Baltimore Orioles have been winning series one after another for some time now, actually sweeping them is very difficult. But if the O\xe2\x80\x99s could somehow take all three games and dump the Yanks to nine games behind, that would make for a rather deep hole. Some might even say that the size of shape of it would constitute such a hole being called a \xe2\x80\x9cgrave.\xe2\x80\x9dOn the other hand, should the Orioles drop the whole series, it would bring New York right back into a tight race \xe2\x80\x93 likely along with the Jays. So there is a lot at stake.With the entire Yankees pitching rotation all on the DL together at some points this season, it is a wonder that the pinstripes should have been able to even remain in the race at all. Actually, some of those taking the place of the regulars on the mound have pitched quite well, and the Orioles are going to be seeing them this week.The Orioles will be pitching Bud Norris tonight, with Wei-Yin Chen and Chris Tillman to follow. The Yankees will open with Chris Capuano, to be followed by Shane Greene and Esmil Rogers. Since these New York pitchers are not exactly household names, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a quick look at each of them\xe2\x80\xa6Chris Capuano has a career record of 74-85, 4.26. Most of those numbers are from the National League. This is only his fourth start and his numbers for this season are 1-2, 3.91 over 50.2 innings. He has only ever pitched a few relief innings against the Orioles.On Tuesday night, Shane Greene will try to replicate his July 12th start against the O\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 a night where he held them scoreless on four hits over 7.1 innings, including nine strikeouts. It was the very best game of his entire MLB career, which now spans a total of seven games! Actually, he might say his last outing of shutting out the Tigers over eight innings was his best. So, will the Orioles be able to move past their common experience of being shut down by a pitcher never before seen by them?

08/12/2014,"[('Preview: Orioles Vs. Yankees \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles have baseball\xe2\x80\x99s most homers while the New York Yankees have surrendered the most in the AL. That combination worked in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 favor to open this three-game set that may not continue Tuesday night because of a murky forecast at Camden Yards. It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear whether Baltimore will get a chance to create more distance between itself and one of its closest pursuers in the AL East with the status of two Orioles infielders also uncertain. The Orioles (68-50) pushed the third-place Yankees a season-high seven games back by winning 11-3 on Monday. Chris Davis, who replaced an injured Manny Machado, hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the fifth inning, Nelson Cruz added a two-run shot in the seventh and No. 9 hitter Jonathan Schoop delivered a three-run blast in the eighth. Baltimore now has 150 homers while New York (61-57) has surrendered 126. The Orioles have outscored the Yankees 55-28 while winning seven of 10 meetings. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s tough,\xe2\x80\x9d New York manager Joe Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know they swing the bats extremely well. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of power in their lineup.\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi emphasized that his club had to capture this series to maintain realistic hopes of winning the East. Now the Yankees would have to take the last two games \xe2\x80\x93 if they\xe2\x80\x99re played. There is reportedly a 90 percent chance of rain Tuesday night in Baltimore. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like tomorrow looks too good,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot can change in 24 hours. I have not been clued on if we do get rained tomorrow what we would do.\xe2\x80\x9d Machado sprained his right knee and limped off the field in the third inning Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll just wait for the results,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said in front of his locker, where a pair of crutches stood. \xe2\x80\x9cHopefully it is on the good side other than the bad.\xe2\x80\x9d He will have an MRI on Tuesday morning to determine the severity of the injury. Davis, batting .197 for the worst average among qualifying hitters, went 2 for 3 with his 21st homer. Shortstop J.J. Hardy, who has 11 hits in his last 23 at-bats, sat out a second straight game with a sprained left thumb. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating no matter what it is, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to play, it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the thumb or anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Hardy said. The Yankees, who remain without catcher Brian McCann due to a concussion, have totaled four runs and 15 hits during a three-game slide. New York will start rookie Shane Greene (3-1, 2.89 ERA), who threw a gem the only time he faced Baltimore by striking out a season-high nine in 7 1-3 innings in a 3-0 road victory July 12 in his second career start. The right-hander enters after another scoreless effort as he went eight innings to earn Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 victory over Detroit. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Wei-Yin Chen (12-4, 3.90), who posted a 2.53 ERA in winning five straight starts before allowing four runs over five innings Wednesday in a 5-1 loss at Toronto. The left-hander is 2-3 with a 5.76 ERA in eight starts against the Yankees. Jacoby Ellsbury is 6 for 13 against him.

Following a seemingly innocuous ground ball to shortstop, Manny Machado was curled up in the batter\'s box, clutching his right knee. What\'s worse, this was not the same knee injured less than a year ago in Tampa Bay. This time, fans of the orange and black don\'t have to guess how life would be without the 22 year old manning the hot corner. They already know the grim reality.    Name: Manuel Arturo Machado Number: 13Born: July 6, 1992\xc2\xa0(22 years old) in Hialeah, FLHeight: 6\'2"" Weight: 180 lbsBats: Right Throws: RightDrafted: 1st round (3rd overall) in 2010 by the\xc2\xa0Baltimore OriolesSchool: Briot Miami Private School (Miami, FL)Contract: $519,000 salary in 2014 (Arbitration eligible, Free Agent: 2019)Walk-up song: ""Otis"" by Jay Z Personal How much can be said about Machado\'s professional baseball career? He is the most exciting and accomplished young man to don an Oriole uniform since Cal Ripken Jr. in the early 80s. He is a first round draft choice that was pegged to make All-Star games, lead a team to the playoffs and win awards. He has done all of those things in under five years of pro ball. He gives a lot of the credit to his upbringing. Machado was raised by his mother, grandmother, aunt and uncle, Gio Brito, in the inner city of Miami. He also has an older sister, Yasmine, who is about 10 years his senior. His mother, Rosa, worked two jobs and usually only spent time with Manny on Saturdays, but eventually that would be the day of the week that Manny\'s baseball games were. So, it was nice to have the other helping hands around. Uncle Gio was Manny\'s baseball coach from an early age. Every day, he would wait for Uncle Gio to get off work. When he did, the two would play catch. They did so nearly every day until Manny was old enough to be in a league.    Back in April of 2013, Brito shared a story with MLB.com\'s Brittany Ghiroli that when Manny was 9 years old he told Uncle Gio that he needed to be taken out of the game. He went and threw up to the side of the field. With no towels present, Brito told him to take his socks off to clean everything up. Then, Manny asked to be put back in the game, and he was. He played the remainder of the day with an upset stomach and no socks.    Perhaps Manny\'s biggest baseball influence was his late grandfather, Francisco Nunez.. He taught Manny to stay humble and to always work on the basics of the game. Nunez stressed the art of bunting and staying down to earth. Unfortunately, Nunez passed away on Christmas Eve, 2009 before he was able to see Manny be drafted or play in a professional game. To this day, Manny traces the letters ""FN"" in the dirt before every game. Growing up in Miami, Manny has become friends with several players who are from the same area. He has a well publicized relationship with Alex Rodriguez. As many kids born in the late 80s and early 90s did, Machado idolized A-Rod. When he was drafted, he looked to the infamous Yankee third baseman for guidance in the transition from amateur to professional athlete. However, his best baseball buddy is San Diego Padres first baseman Yonder Alonso.    The two met when Manny was an upperclassman in high school in 2009. He was being recruited by many schools; chief among them was the University of Miami (Fla.). \xc2\xa0He received a call from one of the Hurricanes stars, Alonso. It wasn\'t just a recruitment. Alonso offered Machado a friendship, asking if he needed anyone to workout or train with. After Manny was drafted, the two became tight. Manny would come over Yonder\'s house nearly every day. The two would talk baseball but also play video games and talk the way young guys do. Making the duo into a trio was Yonder\'s younger sister, Yainee. In the winter of 2011, all three of them went to Spain on a vacation. When they returned, Manny revealed to Yonder that he viewed Yainee as more than a friend and asked if it would be alright if he asked her out. In a 2013 interview with USA Today and Bob Nightengale, Yonder said that he told Manny the following:    ""As long as you respect her and be there for her, and whatever happens, just know if something happens between you guys we\'re still friends. We were friends before, and we\'ll be friends afterward,"" But that ""something"" never happened. Instead, the two fell in love and actually bought a dog together (a big sign that it\'s meant to be). It is an Alaskan Klee Kai named ""Kobe"", much to the shagrin of Manny, a Miami Heat fan. Yainee and the entire Alonso crew are Los Angeles Lakers supporters. Yainee is a former member of the Miami Marlins Mermaids cheer-leading squad and has a pre-med degree from the University of Miami. She plans to become a physician\'s assistant. The future Mr. and Mrs. Machado got engaged on February 6 of last year but, according to that same USA Today story, it was no easy task for the Orioles third baseman. They drove to South Beach to spend a night together. While there, the kitchen sink in their room broke, something caused their dinner to be delayed a few hours and the spot where Machado planned to pop the question was occupied by a snoozing homeless man. On top of that, Manny struggled to pry the ring out of his pocket and when he did, Yainee didn\'t hear him ask the question.    ""He\'s on his knees and talking, saying sweet things,"" she told USA Today. ""I didn\'t hear him propose."" Eventually she got the gist of what was going on and responded in the affirmative. The two have set their date as December 6 in Paris. Much of this article is meant to be on a lighter note and to take a look at things off the field. But the fact remains that events on the field can effect a person\'s life beyond baseball. So this is to hoping that Manny recovers swiftly and safely for his own good. Get well soon, 13.

Somebody jumps off the ice and somebody jumps on it. That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of how it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s what they do. God bless them. I\xe2\x80\x99d do the same thing if I was them and could do it.\xe2\x80\x9dHumor aside, Showalter clearly knows what he and his players are up against as they approach the season\xe2\x80\x99s stretch run. He has managed the Orioles to the top of the American League East, a rarefied place at this late point in the year. But Showalter has seen no reason to grow comfortable. As far as he is concerned, there is a chunk of the season left to play, and teams, particularly the big-money Yankees, will not easily give up their pursuit.That is why the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 11-3 win over the Yankees was so important. It increased their division lead over the third-place Yankees to seven games. (The second-place Toronto Blue Jays, who started the evening five games behind, played a late game against the Seattle Mariners.) There may be a quarter of the season left to play, as Showalter pointed out, but leads like that are never easy to erase.

Chris Davis and Nelson Cruz blasted two-run homers, and the game, played under intermittent rainfall, lost its tension before too long. Jonathan Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s three-run homer in the eighth felt inconsequential beyond adding to the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 misery.

He did not mention the left-hander Chris Capuano, who was acquired July 24 and has proved to be a solid arm. Capuano provided another decent start Monday, giving up four runs over six innings while striking out seven Orioles, but he took the loss.

Brett Gardner ripped a leadoff triple to center field and scored on Derek Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s ground-ball out to give them a 1-0 lead. But the Orioles tied it up in the bottom of the first, when Nelson Cruz knocked a sacrifice fly to deep center to score Manny Machado, who had doubled and reached third on a wild pitch. (Two innings later, Machado left the game in obvious pain after spraining his right knee on an awkward swing.)

Carlos Beltran was standing on third base and Chase Headley was at first when a botched hit-and-run play left Headley stranded between bases. But Beltran made a threatening move toward home, diverting the fielders\xe2\x80\x99 attention to the third-base line.

We love it when important things happen in Baltimore, but we\'d probably love it a lot more if the election of baseball\'s new fearless leader came along with an announcement that the 2016 All-Star Game will be at Camden Yards or some kind of resolution to the long-simmering television rights dispute between the Orioles and the Washington Nationals. var adSkipCounter = 0; It seems like an obvious time and place for a discussion of those issues, but they are not on the agenda. This quarterly summit will be all about reaching a strong consensus on who will replace Bud Selig, whose 22-year tenure as both acting and permanent commissioner is set to end in January.Selig is retiring at age 80 after steering the national pastime through its most noxious labor period and dragging the sport kicking and screaming into a new era of strict testing and discipline for performance-enhancing drugs. The selection committee has narrowed the list of candidates to three finalists \xe2\x80\x94 MLB chief operating officer Rob Manfred, MLB executive vice president of business Tim Brosnan and Boston Red Sox chairman Tom Werner \xe2\x80\x94 one of whom must be approved by at least 23 of the 30 clubs.Manfred long has been considered a likely successor to Selig because of his deep involvement in just about every major issue that has faced MLB over the past couple decades. His relationship with Selig dates back to his role as outside counsel to the owners during the sport\'s disastrous work stoppage in 1994-95.He remains the apparent commissioner-in-waiting, but the walk-up to this week\'s election has not been without intrigue. There have been rumors of a rift between Selig and Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, and speculation that Werner was promoted as a candidate by a group of owners hoping to get enough votes to keep Manfred from achieving the necessary super-majority.There was enough smoke, in fact, that last week both Reinsdorf and Selig felt the need to publicly deny any personal animosity between them, and Selig went a step further by insisting in a statement released Friday that there has been no internal discord among the owners with regard to the candidates or the selection process.Selig arrived in Baltimore on Tuesday and held a news conference at Camden Yards, where he expressed satisfaction with the process but declined to get too specific about what will happen over the next couple days.""The process has worked just the way I thought it would. \xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t want to make any other predictions other than that,"" he said. ""It should be a fair process. We have quite a 48-hour process where we\'ll look at things. A lot of other people are making predictions. I\'m staying out of that business, really because I don\'t know.""That\'s classic Bud.He has always cast himself as the consensus commissioner \xe2\x80\x94 spending long hours on the telephone getting the pulse of baseball ownership on every issue. That\'s why he has been so popular with the owners and held the commissionership so long, but don\'t be fooled into thinking he doesn\'t get what he wants when he wants it.Still, it is not out of the realm of possibility that the selection process could stretch well beyond Thursday if a group of eight or more owners hunker down to keep Manfred from being rubber-stamped. Selig obviously wants this to be over soon so he can begin transitioning into retirement, but he dismissed the notion that a protracted period of indecision would be damaging to the sport.""I know that when I went through this in \'83 and \'84, Bowie [Kuhn] was leaving, it was a tough time,"" Selig said. ""I wound up the chairman of the search committee, [former Orioles owner] Edward Bennett Willams was on it \xe2\x80\xa6 I\'ve been through all of that, and it went on for a long time. People were saying we\'ll never recover. We recovered. We have a thorough process.""Clubs are entitled to vote the way they want. And we\'ll see what happens, but talking about damage and so forth, I reject that completely. I think that\'s nonsense. If there were something flawed in the process, that would be one thing. But this seven-man committee has done really good work. We\'ll see what happens.""There is only one thing that seems absolutely certain. Selig, who was a magnet for criticism during baseball\'s most volatile period of labor unrest and was accused of looking the other way during the early years of the steroid era, will exit the commissioner\'s office in an era of unprecedented labor peace, PED oversight and economic prosperity.That\'s not a bad legacy.Now, about that All-Star Game.peter.schmuck@baltsun.comtwitter.com/SchmuckStopRead more from columnist Peter Schmuck on his blog, ""The Schmuck Stops Here,"" at baltimoresun.com/schmuckblog.Baltimore Sun reporter Dan Connolly contributed to this column.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldPriest at once defended, excoriated1969 slayings of 2 women forge police-FBI liaisonA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

08/13/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Shifting Sands of a Baseball Season', 'Jul 23, 2014; Anaheim, CA, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Chris Tillman (30) in the first inning of the game against the Los Angeles Angels at Angel Stadium of Anaheim. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY SportsAt the beginning of every baseball season, fans and writers who follow teams like the Baltimore Orioles ponder over who will comprise the 25-man roster for opening day. At that point, the composition of the team looks very much \xe2\x80\x9cset.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 There might be a couple of changes imagined, and everyone knows some injuries are likely to happen, but the amount of upset and change that occurs over the course of 162 games is completely outside the realm of imagination at that point.The shifting sands of the Baltimore Orioles continue all about them. It is a constant juggling act that Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette orchestrate on a daily basis to put the best possible lineup on the field when the schedule and the weather allow them to actually play.The schedule and the weather have conspired against the Orioles again, with the game yesterday being rained out and rescheduled for September. Along with the injuries to J.J. Hardy and Manny Machado, there is some more lineup shuffling going on.Cord Phelps is being brought up from Norfolk to likely join the O\xe2\x80\x99s and add some infield depth. Would you have believed me a week ago if I told you that Cord Phelps would be on the 25-man roster on August 13th?\xc2\xa0 Several other names would have come to mind before this one, so there must be a story behind this that is not generally seen.The rainout also shifts the pitching matchup. The Orioles will keep Chris Tillman on schedule while pushing back Wei-Yin Chen. This plays to the strengths of each.The Yankees have decided to not use Shane Greene, but to rather skip him and send Michael Pineda to the mound instead. He has not pitched since April, when he was found with pine tar and suspended\xe2\x80\x94during which he was injured pitching a workout.This strikes me as a desperate move on the part of the Yankees so as to not lose another game on the Orioles. They are currently seven games behind, while Toronto has fallen to 6.5 after a loss to Seattle last night.

The Orioles were totally shut down by Greene the last time they saw him. And who knows what to expect from a pitcher in his first game after an extended layoff?My guess is that Chris Davis will be at third base tonight, with Ryan Flaherty at shortstop and Yankee killer Jonathan Schoop at second. Did you ever see a happier baseball player than Schoop was after his first home run at Oriole Park? Steve Pearce will likely be picking the ball at first base.It would be a great opportunity for the Orioles to win this game and drop the Yankees far enough behind that they need to only be thinking about stealing a wildcard spot.

The Nationals own the other 15 percent, a share that rises by 1 percentage point each year and will top out at 33 percent.The New York Supreme Court for New York County granted MASN\'s request for a temporary restraining order Aug. 7, blocking the league from implementing the committee\'s decision. The court has scheduled a hearing in the case Monday.The dispute stems from a 2005 agreement brokered by Major League Baseball under which the Orioles allowed the Montreal Expos to relocate to Washington and become the Nationals, taking a piece of what had been Orioles territory. The agreement left the Orioles in control of MASN as compensation, but called for the TV-rights fee to reset every five years under a formula.Several years ago, the Nationals took issue with the rights fees \xe2\x80\x94 now about $40 million a year \xe2\x80\x94 they receive from MASN. The team requested $118 million, according to court documents. The matter ended up before a committee of three major league owners who determined that the annual fees should rise, effectively lowering MASN\'s profit margin.For months, Selig \xe2\x80\x94 who is retiring in January and whose successor is expected to be chosen at the baseball owners meeting this week in Baltimore \xe2\x80\x94 has urged the parties to resolve the dispute amicably and reserved the right to impose sanctions if they went to court.Frustrated when the teams turned to the New York court in July, Selig told the parties to attend an Aug. 6 hearing to discuss sanctions.But the Orioles challenged Selig\'s authority to sanction them in the case, balked at appearing at the hearing and threatened new litigation. The team argued that Major League Baseball\'s constitution, which says final authority for disputes between teams rests with the league, does not extend to MASN.""In light of the pending New York litigation and the possibility of further litigation if the commissioner attempts to impose sanctions, we must advise you that our clients do not intend to appear at the sanctions hearing,"" lawyers for MASN and the Orioles wrote in an Aug. 5 letter to the league\'s attorneys.Major League Baseball canceled the hearing. Selig has not indicated who might be sanctioned or what the penalties could be. Sanctions could include suspensions or fines.The Aug. 5 letter raised the possibility that Orioles majority owner Peter G. Angelos might be sanctioned.Asked Tuesday about the possibility of sanctions, Selig said: ""I don\'t want to discuss my correspondence with the clubs. They know what the rules are, and I know what the rules are. We\'re having actual constructive dialogue with both clubs.""Recent letters from Selig have asserted his jurisdiction over disputes between MASN and the Nationals. The letters were sent to Angelos and Nationals owner Theodore Lerner, according to court documents.League spokesman Patrick Courtney \xc2\xa0said Wednesday that he had no comment on the canceled sanctions hearing.Separately, MASN filed the arbitration claim seeking compensation if the league committee\'s decision is enforced, court documents show.A July 31 letter to the American Arbitration Association from an attorney for the Orioles said MASN and the club are seeking ""not less than $800 million in lost asset value"" from the league.The claim was filed with the independent arbitration association, which was designated under the 2005 agreement to settle certain disputes between the Orioles and the league.Attorneys for the Orioles and the Nationals declined to comment Wednesday, citing the pending litigation.The attorneys for MASN and the Orioles asserted in the Aug. 5 letter that their clients had a right under federal arbitration law to seek court redress. They said the league should not be able to make decisions about economic issues in which it has a stake.

They used Chris Davis, a slugger who entered the day with a sub-.200 average and 139 strikeouts, in the No. 2 hole. They did not reach base against Michael Pineda until the fifth inning and looked helpless against reliever Dellin Betances.It made perfect sense, then, for Jonathan Schoop, who carried a .216 average into the game, to make a bold prediction to a teammate on the bench in the eighth inning.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to do something special here,\xe2\x80\x9d Schoop said he told Machado. \xe2\x80\x9cI might take this guy deep.\xe2\x80\x9dHe did, of course, because that is how this summer is going for the surging Orioles. That home run tied the game, and Adam Jones soon ripped a three-run shot to carry the Orioles past the fizzling Yankees, 5-3, at Camden Yards.

Betances blamed himself for throwing a terrible pitch, a juicy slider, but was hopeful the Yankees would recover.

Remember, the Yankees won seven of eight games after the All-Star break to leave the .500 mark behind. Now they are sliding back to it.For the second year in a row, Manager Joe Girardi is getting more from his team than the numbers say he should. But the Yankees (61-58) are not catching the Orioles, and they also trail three teams for the second wild-card spot. Nothing suggests they are exceptional.On some level this must delight the 29 other owners, who are here this week to vote for a new commissioner. The outgoing Bud Selig has preached the virtues of competitive balance \xe2\x80\x94 hope and faith in every market, like a chicken in every pot \xe2\x80\x94 and the Yankees for years stood in the way of that goal. They made the playoffs every season but one from 1995 through 2012.

They spend more on payroll than every team but the Los Angeles Dodgers. Yet they are more games out of first place in their division than the frugal Miami Marlins are in theirs.

He showed admirable restraint by refusing a 10-year contract for Robinson Cano and spent lavishly for the ace right-hander Masahiro Tanaka. Cano is having a strong season in Seattle. Tanaka is trying to avoid elbow reconstruction, still limited to easy games of catch.

General Manager Brian Cashman traded for three everyday players in July to give the offense a boost and give Girardi positional flexibility. But for now the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 offense is still struggling.

Their performance has been uneven, but at least they have not had to deal with the insufferable act of Alex Rodriguez. Selig and his likely successor, Rob Manfred, sent Rodriguez away for this season as punishment for his latest drug dalliance, and the game is better for it.Alas, Steinbrenner acknowledged that Rodriguez would be back next season. No surprise there: Teams tend not to cut players to whom they owe $61 million for the next three years.

We just have to go from there, see how he does and how he responds to playing every day in spring training.\xe2\x80\x9dRodriguez is a hard worker? Oh, please. His repeated reliance on performance-enhancing drugs shatters that myth. But this is the kind of nonsense we will hear, again and again, when Rodriguez takes over this team\xe2\x80\x99s air space next spring.The Yankees may be more interesting then, but not in a good way. This much is certain, anyway: When Rodriguez returns, they will no longer be like the rest of the pack.  Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.

The result would have been the same had the score been 1-0\xe2\x80\xa6the Baltimore Orioles would lead NY by eight games in the division. However sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s how one does things that makes the difference between it being solid, and potentially being a ground-shifting type of moment that might have been more about poetic justice or even destiny than anything else.Chris Tillman recorded a quality start for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and yet he almost took the title of \xe2\x80\x9chard luck loser.\xe2\x80\x9d Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7 IP, 5 H, 2 R, 0 BB, 3 K. The two New York runs came on a Francisco Cervelli homer in the third inning. Unfortunately for Tillman, NY starter Michael Pineda was equally as good as Tillman. The O\xe2\x80\x99s weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to afford nary a base runner until the fifth inning when Nelson Cruz led off with a double. Cruz would come into score on a Ryan Flaherty sac fly-RBI, which cut the NY lead to 2-1.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsLuckily for the Birds, Pineda only lasted five innings after coming off the DL to make the start. New York called Pineda up prior to their initial wishes just to make this start, which shows how important this one game was to them \xe2\x80\x93 as well as to the Orioles. Pineda did his job, but at that point in the game the Birds were yet to do theirs.Due to the later heroics, one aspect of the game which might get lost in all of this is the fact that NY manager Joe Girardi was ejected from this game for arguing an interference call in the seventh inning. I suppose that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with what happened on the field a few moments later, however it certainly served as an \xe2\x80\x9cappetizer\xe2\x80\x9d of sorts for the Orioles fans. Then the fireworks started.With one gone in the last of the eighth the party started at the yard. Jonathan Schoop, who always had seemed to hit New York well in his limited experience against them, took strike one in his at-bat. However he didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait around long enough to see strike two or beyond. Schoop sent a deep shot to left, which seemed to have some menthol on it. When the ball cleared the fence the Baltimore Orioles had tied the game, and the Camden faithful went into a frenzy.Later in the inning Nick Markakis would send a soft two-out single up the middle, and Chris Davis would proceed to run the count full. With a 3-2 count and the game, and potentially the future of the division hanging in the balance, Davis\xe2\x80\xa6drew a walk. That would in theory come across as an anti-climactic finish to a Davis at-bat\xe2\x80\xa6but\xc2\xa0nothing good happens after a walk.It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say why some people have a certain flair for the dramatic. I can tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that I have in my life; write me a script and I can be deadly, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t just manufacture magic in the moment like some people can. Adam Jones is one of those people. He seems to have the ability to deliver the Orioles from the jaws of defeat when given the opportunity. Nobody rises to the occasion every time, but Jones seems to have a knack for doing it when it\xe2\x80\x99s needed most\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and last night was no exception. Perhaps Jones\xe2\x80\x99 three-run homer in the last of the eighthCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportswasn\xe2\x80\x99t the deepest of most majestic shot we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen fly out of Camden Yards. But with the stakes of this game along with the manner and moment in which it happened, it might be one of the biggest homers in the history of the park.New York would threaten in the ninth and even push a run across on an RBI-ground out, but this was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 night. The fact is that there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot more baseball to play this regular season. And the road certainly gets tougher with Manny Machado and J.J. Hardy out of the lineup (although Hardy is expected back this weekend in Cleveland). However that\xe2\x80\x99s the type of earth-shattering win that a team needs at a point as such in it\xe2\x80\x99s history, to signify regime-change at the top.New York (along with Boston) has been the class of the AL East for the past 15 years or so. Not anymore.  There\xe2\x80\x99s a new sheriff at the top, and the league was served notice of that on this night.  Again, nothing is set in stone as of yet; the Orioles cannot allow themselves to count their chickens before they\xe2\x80\x99re hatched. And there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that Buck Showalter won\xe2\x80\x99t allow that to happen \xe2\x80\x93 the destiny of the 2014 Baltimore Orioles depends on it.

The Orioles defeated the Yankees 5-3. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt may seem like a silly question to ask if the Baltimore Orioles with their 69-50 record and largest divisional lead in all of baseball are able to beat the poorer teams they play. But when one digs into the numbers, you see that it is a fair question.There is no doubt that the Orioles are able to defeat the better teams. The strongest division in the American League this year has been the West. \xc2\xa0The O\xe2\x80\x99s have the best record in the league against the AL West with their 21-12 mark. By percentage, that is even better than the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s 27-20 record in their own division.As well, the Baltimore Orioles have the best record in the league against their own division, currently at 30-19 in the AL East.However, the Birds have the absolute worst record in the American League against the Central Division at 9-14. That is strange!So can the Orioles win against this mighty powerhouse division? They had better! Ten of their next 17 games will be against AL Central teams \xe2\x80\x93 three each with the Indians and White Sox, and four with the Twins. So it is not like they are playing the powerhouse Tigers or the red-hot Royals.The other seven games in this 17-game stretch feature three against the White Sox and four against the Rays. All of these teams have losing records except for the Indians \xe2\x80\x93 who are an even 60-60.Everyone was wondering how the Baltimore Orioles would fare against the three tough West Coast teams, opening the second half of the season on a long road trip versus the top three squads. After that trip and with six more at home against the Angels and Mariners, they were 10-6; and the O\xe2\x80\x99s have additionally been 7-2 since then \xe2\x80\xa6 all of this adding up to 17-8 since the break. If a team could sustain that pace for a whole season, it would equal a record of 110-52. Yes, the Orioles have been playing good baseball.It would seem that everything is aligned for the Orioles to run away with the divisional title by beating up on poorer teams and expanding their current 7.5-game lead over the Jays and 8-game margin on the Yankees. But this has been an upside-down year in every way, and easy and expected things are not what has happened.

Just two months ago on June 16th, the Baltimore Orioles were 35-34 and five games out of first place. Since then, over a period of 50 games, they have been 34-16 \xe2\x80\xa6 yep, that is 17-8 over two consecutive 25-game stretches both before and after the break.So, who else has as much of a \xe2\x80\x9cteam of destiny\xe2\x80\x9d look about them right now? Maybe the A\xe2\x80\x99s? Any other? Not really. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Preview: Orioles At Indians \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' By TOM CASTRO STATS Senior Editor (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles are pulling away in the AL East, but extending their winning ways Friday night could be a tall order against Cleveland Indians ace Corey Kluber, the hottest starting pitcher in baseball. Wei-Yin Chen had also been on an impressive roll before his latest outing, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get back on track and deliver a third straight win for hot-hitting Baltimore as it opens a three-game series in Cleveland. The Orioles (69-50) finished a two-game sweep of their rain-shortened set against the New York Yankees on Wednesday, rallying for a 5-3 victory as Jonathan Schoop and Adam Jones homered in a four-run eighth inning. Offense has been the key of late for Baltimore, which has scored seven or more runs five times in the past nine games and reached double figures in three of those. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we\xe2\x80\x99re down by one we always feel we\xe2\x80\x99re just one pitch away,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said. The Orioles, 7 1/2 games up in the division, haven\xe2\x80\x99t lost two in a row since June 28 and 29, going 27-11 in that span. Baltimore leads the majors with 152 home runs, is 35-10 when hitting more than one and 58-25 when going deep at least once. Making Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s win all the more impressive was the fact that the club played without infielders Manny Machado \xe2\x80\x93 placed on the disabled list with a sprained knee prior to the game \xe2\x80\x93 and J.J. Hardy, leaving the lineup with a final five of Delmon Young, Steve Pearce, Ryan Flaherty, Schoop and Nick Hundley. Hardy hopes to return in this series and his team could use him against Kluber (13-6, 2.46 ERA), who\xe2\x80\x99s had little trouble shutting down every lineup he\xe2\x80\x99s faced over the past three weeks and rarely gives up home runs. The right-hander has allowed one earned run in his last 31 1-3 innings. He won his third straight start and sixth in seven outings Saturday, throwing six innings of four-hit ball in a 3-0 road win over the Yankees. He struck out 10 for the fourth time in seven starts. \xe2\x80\x9cJust stick with my same approach. Maybe just executing a little better,\xe2\x80\x9d Kluber said of his recent success. Kluber has given up 10 homers in 171 2-3 innings and none in his previous five starts. He has faced Baltimore twice, most recently pitching seven innings and striking out nine in a 9-0 road win May 24. Chen (12-4, 3.90) had also been on a roll prior to his last start, coming into it having won a career-best five straight with a 2.53 ERA. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly as effective Wednesday, allowing four runs in five innings of a 5-1 loss to Toronto. The left-hander has struggled against Cleveland, allowing 11 runs in 13 innings over two starts. The latest was an 8-7 home loss May 22 in which he gave up five runs in 6 2-3 innings. The Indians (60-60), though, still haven\xe2\x80\x99t established any extended consistency after their three-game winning streak ended in a 1-0, 12-inning home loss to Arizona on Wednesday. They are five games out of the second wild-card spot and need to pass three teams to reach it. The club\xe2\x80\x99s offense will get a needed boost Friday with the return of outfielder Michael Bourn, who\xe2\x80\x99s been on the DL since June 6 with a hamstring injury. Nelson Cruz is 3 for 9 with two doubles and a homer off Kluber, while Michael Brantley \xe2\x80\x93 batting .412 in his last 13 games \xe2\x80\x93 has gone 3 for 5 with a triple and a double against Chen.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWith their win last night the Orioles are now 7.5 games up on the second place Blue Jays, which is the largest lead of any division leader in all of baseball. With only 43 games remaining in the season the division title seems almost evitable. They also improved their record to 69-50 which is currently the third best record in baseball. However, despite their success there are still a number of skeptics around baseball.For most of the season the majority of MLB analysts have been quick to brand the Orioles as a powerful offensive team whose biggest weakness remains their starting pitching. However, for those who have followed the Orioles closely this season that simply hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the case. It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that with their lineup the Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to struggle to score runs, but it\xe2\x80\x99s their starting pitching that has been the key to their recent surge.The first example of this would have to be opening day starter and assumed staff ace Chris Tillman. With another strong start last night Tillman has now allowed three runs or less in 13 straight starts. In his last ten starts he has an ERA of 2.60 and has an ERA of 1.74 in three starts in August. It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to note his last eight starts have come against teams with winning records.The two most consistent starters have been Bud Norris and Wei-Yin Chen. Norris has had a sub-4.00 ERA in every month since April, at 10-7, he has been the quality starter at back of the end of the rotation the Orioles have been missing in recent years. With 12 wins Chen has gotten his share of run support this season. However, he has also pitched well enough to deserve his good fortune. He has allowed 3 runs or less in eight of his last ten games.Despite being sent to AAA last week Miguel Gonzalez may have been having one of the best seasons of all the starters. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed more than four runs since his first start of the season and has failed to go five innings only twice. He also seemed to be heating up for the stretch run with an ERA of 1.82 in July.The two wild cards in the rotation are Kevin Gausman and Ubaldo Jimenez. Gausman has the best stuff on the team and has shown flashes greatness since he broke into the rotation going 6-4 with a respectable 3.90 ERA. If he could polish his talent into being a more consistent starter he could be the most important pitcher in the playoffs.Ubaldo Jimenez has been a really expensive frustration so far for the Orioles. However, he did have the second-best ERA in the second half of last season. While that can give the Orioles some hope he can turn the season around, if he can\xe2\x80\x99t the Orioles have enough options to be successful without him in the rotation.Several of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters began the season slowly, but mid-way through August the Orioles now have five starters with ERAs under 4.00. It\xe2\x80\x99s true names like Gonzalez, Chen and Norris don\xe2\x80\x99t carry the star-power of the Tiger\xe2\x80\x99s Price, Verlander or Scherzer, and that could be partially responsible for the national media\xe2\x80\x99s skepticism. However, anyone watching the Orioles closely this season realizes the Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t winning games in spite of their starting pitching. In fact, of late it might be their biggest strength.

After bruising negotiations and the threat of litigation by the Baltimore team, baseball reached an agreement with the Orioles giving the club control of the regional television network it shares with the Nationals as compensation for the loss of territory.While the deal was supposed to settle the matter, the Nationals bridled under the agreement and now seek to level the economic field by demanding more in television rights fees from the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. As attorneys head to court Monday for an important hearing in the brewing case, the Orioles\' demeanor in court documents resembles that of an unapologetic whistle-blower. The attorneys use words like ""corrupted,"" ""fraud"" and ""bias"" to describe the baseball procedures it is challenging. var adSkipCounter = 0; Lawyers for MASN argued in a New York court memorandum filed Wednesday that the process baseball employed to try to resolve the television dispute contained ""pervasive conflicts of interest, intolerable self-dealing, and fraud.""Because the court declined Major League Baseball\'s request to seal the record, all of the charges and countercharges are available publicly.""In general, the league and the teams despise having their differences aired in open court,"" said Rich Brand, an attorney and media rights expert who chairs the sports practice group at the firm Arent Fox. ""No league would be happy about this stuff.""At issue is a June 30 decision of three club owners arbitrating the rights fee disagreement between the Nationals and MASN, which broadcasts both the Orioles\' and Washington\'s games. The Orioles hold a majority stake in MASN, which says the decision would force it to distribute excessive rights fees to the Nationals, decimating the network\'s profit margin. That would leave the Orioles with less money as well.Rights fees can pay for player salaries, provide funds for new facilities and, generally, be the difference, Brand said, ""between a team doing very well or not so well.""In documents, the Nationals counter that the Orioles continue to benefit from the ""immensely favorable terms"" of the 2005 settlement agreement.The Orioles own 85 percent of MASN, while the Nationals own 15 percent, a stake that is growing by a percentage point each year until it tops out at 33 percent. As a result, most MASN profits flow to the Orioles.The Nationals, who receive about $40 million a year in annual rights fees, requested an increase to $118 million that they said represented fair market value, according to court documents. The arbitration panel would boost the fee \xe2\x80\x94 which is the same for both clubs \xe2\x80\x94 to about $60 million, court documents show.Attorneys for MASN and the Orioles seem to be not only challenging the decision but also the authority of retiring Commissioner Bud Selig, who says the dispute should have remained internal.""The MLB constitution says the owners put their trust in the commissioner and agree he is the person who has final authority to resolve any dispute among the owners,"" said Stephen F. Ross, a Pennsylvania State University professor who specializes in sports law. ""The commissioner could say, \'[Orioles owner] Peter Angelos, you are not acting in the best interests of baseball and I\'m going to suspend you.\' ""MASN argues that it has the right under federal arbitration law and the 2005 agreement to seek recourse outside the commissioner\'s office.According to court records, Selig sought to convene an Aug. 6 hearing on possible sanctions, but lawyers for the Orioles and MASN said they would not attend, and the hearing was canceled.The commissioner has said he is focused on reaching an amicable settlement. Selig and his aides have declined comment while the matter is litigated.The case is unfolding in the New York Supreme Court for New York County, which issued a temporary restraining order Aug. 7, blocking baseball from imposing its decision and the Nationals from withdrawing TV rights from MASN. At Monday\'s hearing, the court will hear arguments on whether to make the injunction permanent.Meanwhile, MASN filed an arbitration claim against Major League Baseball with the American Arbitration Association, seeking at least $800 million in damages for breach of contract if baseball\'s decision is enforced.The Orioles argue in the arbitration claim that baseball did not use the proper methodology in determining the rights fee, according to documents filed in the New York court. The correct standard, the club\'s lawyers say, is a formula developed by Bortz Media & Sports Group, a Colorado consulting firm.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldPriest at once defended, excoriated1969 slayings of 2 women forge police-FBI liaisonA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

Mandatory Credit: David Richard-USA TODAY SportsWhat are the Baltimore Orioles going to do with Ubaldo Jimenez? The expensive pitcher gave up six runs on Saturday night against his old team in just 4.1 innings. Again, it was a lack of command of his pitches that got him into trouble, as the Orioles lost their second consecutive game to the Indians 6-0.Jimenez began the game with two consecutive walks, and with one out Carlos Santana hit his 21st home run of the season. I wonder how many Baltimore fans switched over to the Ravens game for good at that point.Ubaldo would give up three more runs in the fifth inning. Even though he only walked three batters on the evening, Jimenez so often is behind in counts that he has to aim for the middle of the plate and hope it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go there. Sometimes it does.It seems to me that this experiment has run its course for this year. The Orioles have five starters who are better than serviceable. Yes, it is sad that the O\xe2\x80\x99s spent so much money on this guy and did not get what they paid for. But it is time to just wind it down for a season and come back next year and see if a better reconnection to a successful past can be found.I have decided today to name my car \xe2\x80\x9cUbaldo\xe2\x80\x9d because it was very expensive and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really work correctly.I recently bought a late model car. My automobile spending patterns would be very similar to those of Peter Angelos, Dan Duquette, and the Orioles organization. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to spend money on cars, but sometimes you have to. This vehicle cost me more than any in my lifetime, and now that I have had it for a few weeks I discover that I don\xe2\x80\x99t really like it. It is nothing like I expected. There were features listed on the sticker that do not actually exist. The car was in the shop this week for an alignment (and other issues), and it comes back only slightly repaired. So I have decided today to name my car \xe2\x80\x9cUbaldo\xe2\x80\x9d because it was very expensive and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really work correctly.At some point I\xe2\x80\x99m going to need to cut my losses, just as the Baltimore Orioles are going to need to determine how to deal with their bad investment. Perhaps \xe2\x80\x9cFresh Eyes\xe2\x80\x9d can concentrate over the offseason on getting things aligned and tweaked, hoping the investment pays off another year. It is too risky right now to depend upon Jimenez.It is difficult to win a divisional title and have realistic hopes of going beyond when you have on your roster the #1 pitcher in walks in the league, as well as the #1 hitter with strikeouts.I saw on a comment board where someone wrote of Jimenez that he should be named \xe2\x80\x9cA-box-o Chocolates\xe2\x80\x9d because you never know what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryTo be fair, it would not have mattered if Jimenez pitched a perfect game, as the best he could have hoped for was a tie. With the Cleveland Indians looking like the most powerful outfit in the American League, the Orioles have managed just one run on 11 hits in 20 innings. It is like a faucet that is either on or off.Perhaps the O\xe2\x80\x99s can break out in the third and final game of the series and salvage a win against the powerful Cleveland Indians.

Sounds manageable, except that \xe2\x80\xa6 oh no! \xe2\x80\xa6 the worst possible news!\xc2\xa0 The Orioles have never faced him before! ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles avoid sweep vs. Indians with 3-1 victory, thanks ...', "" You can keep the Orioles offense down for a little while, but when they get up, you don't want to be the team still standing there. The O's hitters finally broke out in Cleveland as they tried to stave off a sweep at the hands of the Indians. On Sunday afternoon, the Orioles notched more hits (12) than they did in the rest of the series combined in a 4-1 win over their hosts.    A day after their first back-to-back losses since late June, the Orioles came out looking to avoid their first sweep since late May. Tasked with holding the line was Kevin Gausman, who responded to this challenge by walking two of the game's first three batters. Oh no! Here we go again. Except it was okay, because Cleveland was kind enough to bat an Izturisian infielder second in the form of Jose Ramirez, who bunted to give up an out. Gausman escaped the jam, despite a double steal, after a foul popup and an easy groundout. Initially, the offense did not do a whole lot to help their cause. They came into the game having not scored a run since the eighth inning on Friday night. They blew their first promising scoring chance. Chris Davis, dumped down to seventh in the order, led off the third inning with a double off the left field wall. An awful throw in from left by Michael Brantley allowed Davis to get away with a belly flop slide. The Orioles' luck quickly turned, as Nick Hundley scorched a liner that was caught after a leap by second baseman Jason Kipnis. Davis was doubled off. You couldn't even get mad about it. Despite Jonathan Schoop getting to second on a two-base error and a Nick Markakis walk, the Orioles could not add to the two-out rally to score in the inning.    The Indians got on the scoreboard first in the fourth inning, taking advantage of the fact that Delmon Young was manning left field to start the game. Carlos Santana hit the kind of double that's only a double when hit in Young's direction. One batter later, Kipnis dropped a single in front of a charging Adam Jones. Cleveland's third base coach aggressively sent Santana, which paid off after a wide throw from Jones couldn't be handled by catcher Nick Hundley.    That put the Indians on the board 1-0. They would get no runs, or even any hits, for the whole rest of the game. The Orioles broke out of their scoreless streak in the sixth inning. Steve Pearce led off the inning with a double crushed to center. Jones was hit by a pitch, putting two men on with none out. That was enough for Indians manager Terry Francona to pull his starter, Danny Salazar, in favor of the graybeard Scott Atchison. The next two Orioles batters made outs. With two outs, J.J. Hardy had two strikes on him. Here's where they were about to blow it, only they didn't: Hardy drove an outside fastball into right, getting the O's even on the scoreboard at 1-1.    They were not done yet. Davis muscled a double down the left field line, scoring Jones easily, although Hardy had to stop at third even though there were two outs and the ball went deep into the left field corner. Well, whatever. The run didn't matter. The Orioles' 2-1 lead was all they would need to win the game. After his offense got him the lead, Gausman sent them down 1-2-3 in the sixth inning. He was pulled after that with 91 pitches thrown. It was not a great outing for Gausman, who also walked a pair of batters in the fifth inning, but he bailed himself out by fielding a comebacker for an inning-ending double play. Across his six innings, he gave up only a run on two hits, but he also walked four and struck out only two. Winning without your best stuff is part of pitching. Following Gausman's departure, the Indians did not get another base runner until the ninth inning, when closer Zach Britton issued a one-out walk before getting a game-ending 4-6-3 double play from Kipnis. Darren O'Day and Andrew Miller each also pitched a scoreless inning out of the Orioles bullpen. Miller struck out all three Indians he faced. That's pretty good, right?    After Salazar's departure, Francona employed a parade of relievers for no discernible reason. He used six pitchers over the game's final four innings. Two of them ran into problems, by which I mean homers. Pearce crushed a pitch from Chen-Chang Lee to the gate beyond the left field fence in the seventh inning, his 12th of the season. The next inning, Jonathan Schoop victimized reliever Kyle Crockett, unleashing a display of raw strength as he drove a ball over the fence in deep center. That was also Schoop's 12th homer, and it set up the game's 4-1 final score. Five Orioles had multi-hit games: Pearce, Jones, Hardy, Davis, and Schoop. For being on the mound at the right time, Gausman was given the win, raising his record to 7-4. For his reliever allowing inherited runners to score, Salazar took the loss, dropping to 4-6 on the year. Britton's save was his 26th. Elsewhere in the division, the Yankees beat the Rays, 4-2, while the Blue Jays fell to the White Sox, 7-5. That leaves the Orioles with a seven-game lead over second-place New York, and 7.5 games up on Toronto. The O's still hold the largest division lead in MLB.    The road trip moves on into the Central time zone as the Orioles will spend the week in Chicago. First up are the White Sox on Monday night for a scheduled 8:10 start. Bud Norris will take the mound for the Orioles, while the O's hitters will be up against ace Chris Sale. Sounds like a real even matchup. The Orioles don't face a team that currently has a winning record again until September 12. They ran the gauntlet without getting tripped up.

He's kept the O's within striking distance, but if you add up three of his last four starts, he's surrendered nine runs over just 15.1 IP. On the plus side, he had that gem of seven scoreless innings against the Angels on July 31, and despite being unable to get deep into games, he's struck out 21 over 22.1 IP in his last four. Despite losing about a month in April/May to an elbow strain, Sale is continuing a great season, striking out 30% of batters he faces and walking under 5%. The O's managed two runs over six innings against him in late June (and eventually won that game on Chris Davis's dramatic pinch-hit homer). Sale throws fastballs roughly half of the time to batters of both handedness, about 40% four-seamers to 12% two-seamers. Against fellow lefties, Sale throws his slider most of the rest of the time once he gets ahead in the count, and he'll occasionally use his changeup when behind. Versus righties, the changeup is his main secondary offering, and he'll use it in any count, while using the slider sparingly.

In his last three outings, he's given up just four runs over 20.2 IP. He's also walked two or fewer batters in each of his last six starts, and one or fewer in five of those.    Quintana went on quite a roll from mid-June through July, giving the White Sox better-than-minimum quality starts in seven of eight outings. That stretch included a seven-inning, one-run, eight-strikeout performance at Camden Yards on June 24. Quintana's last few starts haven't been quite as good, but he seems to have been victimized by unfortunate sequencing (four runs in 6.2 IP against the Giants despite allowing only six baserunners) and poor defense (five runs, two earned over 10.2 IP against the Mariners and Twins). Quintana uses fastballs for about 60% of his pitches to both right- and left-handed hitters, and even more often when he gets behind in the count. Against fellow lefties, he goes to his curveball the rest of the time, while against righties, he throws his curve and changeup in equal numbers.

He's just two outs from reaching the innings mark he set last season, making now an interesting time to compare his peripherals. Chen's strikeout rate is essentially the same (2013: 18.2%; 2014: 18.0%), but his walk rate is greatly reduced (6.8% -> 4.2%). He's also managed to increase his groundball percentage (34.4% -> 41.1%), so while he's surrendering more home runs when the ball gets into the air (9.9% -> 12.9%), he may be getting unlucky in that regard this season (3.66 xFIP). Noesi has already played for three different teams this year, beginning the season as a Mariner before spending ten days in the Rangers organization and finally being claimed by Chicago in late April. The White Sox are the only team that's used him as a starter in 2014, and he's settled down into an acceptable back-end rotation piece. He's pretty inconsistent, having put together three quality starts in a row only once this season, but he did hold the O's to two runs over seven innings in late June. Noesi throws fastballs about 60% of the time, mostly four-seamers, though he does occasionally add some sink or cut. His main offspeed offering is a changeup, and lefties will see some curveballs as well, while fellow righties get nearly as many changeups but sliders rather than curves.

And along with two additional solo home runs, they put together a solid team effort to salvage the final game of the series 4-1.There was a lot to like about this game that puts up yet another win to hold off the Yankees and Blue Jays.

Davis was dropped to seventh in the order while Pearce handled the job in the second spot. Schoop turned the lineup over. Five of the nine starters had two hits. Only Nelson Cruz and Nick Hundley were shut out on the day, though both of them hit into solid line-drive outs.The Baltimore Orioles move on now to the second half of this trip with a three-game series with the White Sox, where they will be facing one of the very best pitchers in all of baseball in lefty Chris Sale. His numbers are simply extraordinary. He enters this game with a 10-2 record and ERA of 2.01 over 130 innings. Over the season he has 150 strikeouts, including 40 in his most recent 28 innings (four games, including eight shutout innings against the Giants last week). For the season, his WHIP is an amazing 0.88.\xc2\xa0 For comparison, consider that Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day is at 0.89 \xe2\x80\xa6 so this is like having O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness over seven innings of a game.The Orioles did not particularly help some of those numbers however, as the O\xe2\x80\x99s got 11 hits over six innings against Sale on June 23rd. Even so, Baltimore only scored two runs against him; and Sale would have been the winner that day had not Chris Davis hit a walk-off three-run pinch-hit homer in the ninth inning to give the Orioles a 6-4 victory.

Having acquired the Montreal Expos, baseball shipped them off to the United States capital. Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s initial attempt to make Angelos happy was to give him a revenue guarantee that would make him financially whole. But then, M.L.B. midwifed a network that became the financial vehicle to compensate Angelos.And why not? Regional sports networks were fast becoming assets that could yield extraordinary wealth. And what a sweet deal: The Orioles got 90 percent ownership of the network, a stake that will gradually be pared to two-thirds; total management control; and $75 million from the Nationals.The Nationals got an immediate outlet for their cable games, a below-market rights fee and a stake in the network that will climb no higher than 33 percent.

Unable to agree on a fair market value for the five seasons starting in 2012, they sought a decision by a baseball panel, the Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee. It ruled recently that the Nationals should have gotten about $59 million starting in 2012, with small increases every year after that. The Orioles said the committee had gone beyond its historical methodology for calculating rights fees and said, Nah, that\xe2\x80\x99s too much.

Mandatory Credit: Jon Durr-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles right fielder Nick Markakis just about decapitated White Sox starter Chris Sale with the leadoff hit in the game Monday night. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the hardest-hit ball of the evening for Nick. After Jonathan Schoop broke open a 3-2 game with a two-out, bases-loaded double in the top of the eighth inning, Markakis totally turned on a slider and hit it about as hard as is possible for a two-run shot to right field.The ball was about 20 feet higher than a ball hit toward Markakis in the bottom of the previous inning. With the Orioles clinging to a 3-2 lead with the Sox having a runner on base with two outs, Conor Gillaspie hit a ball to the fence that Nick timed perfectly to bring it back into the park. Within the space of one inning of play, Markakis single-handedly accounted for a four-run swing in the score.The Orioles prevailed in the end 8-2, using a five-run eighth inning to break open what was a close game and beat one of the best pitchers in the American League.The entire game was among the finest the Orioles have played this season.The trademark power was there \xe2\x80\x93 with home runs by J.J. Hardy, Nelson Cruz, and Markakis \xe2\x80\xa6 along with near-misses that resulted in doubles by Schoop and Steve Pearce.There was timely hitting, as six of the eight runs (including all eight in the eighth inning) were scored with two outs.The starting pitching was awesome as Bud Norris had his best game ever as an Oriole \xe2\x80\x93 giving up only one hit in six innings before yielding two runs in the seventh.Brad Brach\xe2\x80\x99s relief pitching was totally dominant, finishing the final two innings with six straight outs \xe2\x80\x93 saving the bullpen. Orioles pitching has now given up just five hits in the last 18 innings.The trademark outstanding Orioles defense had Chicago fans applauding in appreciation for the talent displayed. Not only did Markakis make the aforementioned highlight reel catch, he will be joined on it in sports programs by an amazing sliding catch by Nelson Cruz. And a caught-stealing throw by Caleb Joseph should be shown on films of baseball fundamentals about catcher footwork in a stealing situation. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryThere is simply nothing to criticize about this game or any plays or efforts of any of the Baltimore Orioles.The Birds picked up a half-game each on both the Blue Jays and Yankees who were each idle.For the second game in the series, Chris Tillman (9-5, 3.68) will go against Jose Quintana (6-9, 3.14).

That was the first thing to pop into many a fans mind when Cord Phelps was called upon to take Manny Machado\'s spot on the Orioles roster for the time being. He is no Manny but is one of those ""happy to be here"" kind of guys that, upon further review, I think I\'m happy to have on the team. Ya know, until Manny is back.    Name: Robert Cord Phelps Number: 38Born: January 23, 1987 (27 years old) in Santa Barbara, CAHeight: 6\'1"" Weight: 210 lbsBats: Both Throws: RightDrafted: 3rd round in 2008 by the Cleveland IndiansSchool: Santa Barbara High School (Santa Barbara, CA)Stanford University (Palo Alto, CA)Contract: $500,000 salary in 2014\xc2\xa0Walk-up song: ""It\'s a Long Way to the Top"" By: AC/DC Personal It\'s quite possible that, in Phelps, the Orioles have just added their smartest player to the club. (I\'m sure Darren O\'Day may beg to differ). He grew up in the Golden State and attended Santa Barbara High School. There he was ""the nerd"" and ""the jock"" all rolled into one. In the classroom he would take home honors such as National AP Scholar and National Merit Scholar as well as awards from Bank of America and his high school for academic achievement and had a GPA of 4.83. But he was only his class\' salutatorian, so he could have done better. As with most future big league players he excelled on the the diamond in high school. Throughout his career he was named to all-league and all-division teams. In the summer after his junior year he played games with the St. Louis Cardinals scout team. His senior year he led his team in nearly every offensive category including batting average (.415), RBI (24), on base percentage (.581) and a slew of other things. The combination of his success in the field and on the report card earned him his school\'s Scholar-Athlete award. Despite an outstanding high school career, Phelps did not garner huge recognition from professional scouts. He went undrafted and was set for college. So, where do you go in California if you are incredibly smart and a gifted athlete. There are many options; maybe USC or UCLA, but for Phelps, one stood out above them all; Stanford University.    ""You can\'t beat the quality of the baseball program and the academics,"" he told GoStanford.com.    As a freshman, Phelps played in about half of the Cardinal\'s games but would only post a .196 batting average as he adjusted to NCAA play. He split his time between second and third base, an ability that would eventually help him in professional baseball. He would do the same the following season, even adding innings at shortstop. His junior season was where he stood out. He was named the Most Improved Player at Stanford and selected to the All-Pac-10 team. He did so by smashing 13 home runs and 58 RBI and managing the highest fielding percentage of his collegiate career (.975).    This was enough to beckon a call from the professional ranks. The Indians selected him with their third round selection. He decide to forego his senior year in exchange for a chance at the big-time, signing with Cleveland. He was sent to the Gulf Coast League for one day; that\'s not an exaggeration. He had one start and three at-bats there. He went 0-for-3 and was then sent to short season Mahoning Valley where he raked for 35 games, hitting .312 with 10 doubles and two home runs in 25 games. The following season he began at High-A Kinston and that is where he would stay all season as he struggled to find his way. The power he had shown at short season was gone. Depite playing a full season there, he only managed four home runs, equating to a .363 slugging percentage. However, he was getting on base at a decent clip of .386.    Even with the struggles he was still moved up to double-A Akron and this where his talents started to show real promise. Phelps split that 2010 season between Akron and Triple-A Columbus. In Akron had a line of .296/.346/.397; not bad. But he really shined in Columbus, slashing .317/.386/.506. The success continued in 2011 as he did well again in Triple-A, earning promotion to Cleveland in June of that year. He wasn\'t so hot there, managing to hit just .155 in 71 at-bats and sat on the bench for much of his time in the majors that season. Despite this he was still named the Indians\' 15th best prospect; his highest ranking ever. He would continue to bounce between Cleveland and Columbus for the next two seasons; always playing much better for the Clippers than the Indians. At different points, Baseball American recognized him as one best defensive second basemen in the Indians system, as well as having good discipline at the plate. This past November, the Indians were trying to clear space on the 40-man roster to protect certain players from the Rule 5 Draft. In this process, Cleveland had to designate Phelps for assignment. Five days later, the Orioles claimed him off waivers the same day they grabbed Brad Brach from the Padres. Phelps has spent almost all of 2014 with the Triple-A Norfolk Tides. There he has batted just .258 but in the three weeks leading up to his recent promotion he had found his minor league swing, averaging .329 with three doubles, a triple and a home run in that span.    On top of that, he was recommended to Orioles manager Buck Showalter by scouts and Tides manager Ron Johnson. Not to mention Phelps is a solid defender who provides depth at each infield position and could probably play some outfield in the bigs too if given the chance. And he has pulled the Chris Davis times three; the Tides have made the call to the bullpen for Phelps on three different occasions. He sounds like the type of guy that Birdland could become very fond of right away. He is out of options and will likely be the one moved once Machado is ready to return, but Showalter and Dan Duquette have been known to do crazy things. With September just around the corner, things can only get crazier.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles beat another strong White Sox lefty with a 5-1 win ...', ' One night after facing a Cy Young contender like Chris Sale, the Orioles were tasked with another difficult matchup, a tough lefty in White Sox starter Jose Quintana. Still conditioned to expect the worst when the Orioles face the league\'s best, I did not anticipate good things. I forgot who we were talking about, though. These are the 2014 Orioles. Their opportunities were few, but they delivered in the clutch, driving to a 5-1 victory over Chicago on Tuesday night.    That win, coupled with Yankees and Blue Jays losses, means the Orioles gain a game on each of their divisional competitors, now leading New York by 8.5 games and Toronto by nine. There are 38 games left to play and the Orioles lead is closer to double digits than zero. They are 20 games over .500. This is not a dream. This is reality. Buoyed by the pre-game news that Ubaldo Jimenez has been jettisoned from the starting rotation - actually, I don\'t think he was buoyed, but I sure was - Chris Tillman, who started the game, turned in a gem. The best thing to be said about Tillman tonight is that he made it a boring game. Over eight innings, he only gave up one run on three hits and a walk. The one run came on a first inning mistake to White Sox slugger Jose Abreu, who crushed a baseball into the seats in left center for his 32nd home run of the year. Tillman never faced more than four batters in a single inning and he never faced a batter while there was a runner in scoring position in the whole game. He struck out nine batters. That is ho-hum dominance, the kind of thing you\'re just not expecting to see from Orioles starters. Tillman lowered his season ERA to 3.55 as he picked up his 10th win of the year.    ""The curveball was there for me tonight,"" Tillman told MASN\'s Gary Thorne in his post-game interview. We\'ve all seen those games where he can\'t find the strike zone with it for anything. When it\'s on, though, you get games like tonight. Any Orioles starter who goes eight innings while only allowing one run is going to have a pretty good chance of winning the game.    For Tillman, it was his 12th quality start in his last 14 outings. He hasn\'t allowed more than three earned runs since his one inning mess on June 5 against Texas. As a team, the Orioles only had nine hits over the whole game. That\'s much less than some of the double-digit barrages they have unleashed in recent wins. They only scored a single run by a home run. There are a lot of ways to win a baseball game. The Orioles are finding many of them. On Tuesday, it was timely hitting that brought them to victory.    They got things started from the top of the first inning. Steve Pearce proved he isn\'t quite yet turned into a pumpkin by hitting a ground rule double over the left field fence. Pearce scored easily on an RBI single delivered by Adam Jones, who collected his 76th RBI of the season in the process. That gave the Orioles a 1-0 lead after half an inning, although the Abreu home run in the bottom half meant it didn\'t last for long. Quintana locked them down for a while after that, sending the Orioles down in order in innings 2-4 and allowing only a single to Nick Hundley in the fifth inning. Hundley also somehow stole second base before the inning ended. Catcher speed! Orioles bats will only stay quiet for so long. Sometimes they slumber for whole nights, but sometimes they wake up before the game ends, and if their starter has kept them close, then the game is afoot. Tuesday\'s game was the latter sort.    Whether Quintana tired or the Orioles simply figured something out in the third time through the order, they were able to break through in the sixth inning. Jones got himself on base with a one-out double. One batter later, it looked like he might score on a silo shot from Nelson Cruz, but the ball stopped carrying and died on the warning track. He just missed the mistake pitch. That doesn\'t matter, because the Orioles have a bunch of guys who can get you. Delmon Young gave the O\'s a 2-1 lead with a single into center, easily enough to score the high-1954-socked Jones. The stripes give you extra speed, don\'t you know. They were not done there, either. The flurry of hits continued with a single by birthday boy J.J. Hardy, moving Young up to third. Sub-Mendoza Chris Davis even got in on the act, clearing the bases with a double that split the outfielders in right-center. The 4-1 lead was all they would need, but just for fun, Hundley added a solo homer in the seventh, his third Orioles homer of the season, fourth overall. Why the heck not, right? In one of those stats that only could excite Jim Hunter, it turns out that the Orioles are 9-1 in games where Hundley has an RBI. They are also 1-0 when he steals a base. Hey, whatever works. Tommy Hunter pitched a scoreless ninth. Just about the only downer for the Orioles was that Nick Markakis had a hitting streak halted at ten games. He did his part last night. Others did theirs tonight. This team is 20 games over .500. They\'ve won 72 games this year, something they only did twice from 2001-2011. No team in the division has allowed fewer runs than the Orioles. They are not messing around. The Orioles go for the sweep against Chicago on Wednesday night for a scheduled 8:10pm game. After beating Sale and Quintana, they\'ll probably lose to Hector Noesi. That\'s life. Wei-Yin Chen starts the game for the O\'s. If nothing else, they\'re back to winning a series.

Baltimore Orioles defeat the Chicago White Sox 5-1. Mandatory Credit: Mike DiNovo-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles pitching battery of Chris Tillman and Nick Hundley combined to pitch, catch, hit, and even run the O\xe2\x80\x99s to a 5-1 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday evening.Tillman had one of those games he is capable of throwing where his command is so good that he is in total control. He would only give up a solo home run and total of three hits over eight innings, while striking out nine and moving his record to 10-5, 3.55.Hundley and Tillman fell into a good rhythm that included not only a high-velocity fastball, but the most deadly curve imaginable. As we\xe2\x80\x99ve highlighted before, when Tillman has what pitching coaches call \xe2\x80\x9cdepth\xe2\x80\x9d on his curve, it makes his arsenal just about unbeatable. Of course, this requires a fine touch to move the ball in the strike zone both laterally and vertically through the same space. Of late, Tillman has had control of that touch.There is so much to like about the Orioles pitching right now. Over the past 27 innings, they have given up only four runs on eight hits and five walks. That is an ERA of 1.33 and WHIP of 0.481 \xe2\x80\x93 not bad!Orioles catchers Caleb Joseph and Nick Hundley deserve a good percentage of the credit as well for this run of pitching success. It was Hundley\xe2\x80\x99s turn on Tuesday night, and he contributed by not only calling a great game in synch with Tillman, he had two hits including a home run, AND, a stolen base. And we wondered where all the speed on the Orioles is at! There it is.But even more refreshing than the discovery of Hundley\xe2\x80\x99s blazing speed was the rediscovery of Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 RBI bat. His two-out, two-run double in the sixth inning broke open the game to give the Orioles a 4-1 margin at that point. And with the way Tillman was pitching, that was the backbreaker for the Sox.The final game of the series this evening features 12-4 Wei-Yin Chen against Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Hector Noesi, who threw seven good innings in June against the O\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 scattering nine hits and giving up two runs in a no-decision. Twice before that in 2012, the Orioles pounded him hard and put two losses upon him.The current Baltimore Orioles lineup is 15-for-54 (.278) against Noesi with a home run each by Adam Jones and Nelson Cruz. Hundley is 2-for-5, so maybe he will be back tonight? Surely the Sox catcher will fear that \xe2\x80\xa6 though \xe2\x80\xa6 he likely had other problems and pains overnight \xe2\x80\x93 you had to see the game to know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about there!The Birds are now 8.5 games up on the Yankees and nine games ahead of the Jays. It really does have a nice look about it.NO EXTRA CHARGE FOR THIS: Have you seen the Little League girl pitcher who has taken the baseball world by storm this past week? Look at her pitching style and tell me which Orioles hurler she most resembles. See if you think she looks a bit like one who has recently been sent to the bullpen.

That\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad way to be with the Orioles these days. Cruz took the major league lead with his 33rd home run and the surging Orioles completed a three-game sweep of the White Sox.

The Orioles won 9-2. Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles hold a strong lead in the American League East, and there are some strong keys in their play that look toward a divisional crown for the first time in years.Along with already doing these things, if the Orioles continue to do them, I believe the division is well in their hands.1. PitchingThe Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starting and relief pitching has been excellent, and has helped push the AL East lead to eight and a half games above the second place team, which has been the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays at different points.Despite Wei-Yin Chen being atop my rankings for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters, the Orioles need Chris Tillman and Bud Norris to keep pitching as well as they have recently.In 13 starts since the All-Star break, Tillman and Norris are a combined 7-1 with an ERA of 2.52 between the two pitchers. They have a combined WHIP of 1.01.Both pitchers have been dominating and have certainly led the charge for this strong Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching staff.There is one key to continue this success, which the Orioles had no choice to follow until recently, and that is to not allow Ubaldo Jimenez to start. \xe2\x80\x9cJimenez is only hurting the Orioles as a team\xe2\x80\x9dHe may have $43 million contract, but he is not worth the money. Jimenez is only hurting the Orioles as a team, and is not helping the bullpen with his short starts.As of now, the Orioles have moved Jimenez from a starting role to the bullpen. Before this, an injury kept Jimenez from starting, and in that time, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers began their current stretch of dominance.Unless he proves he can be consistent while in the bullpen, he should not be allowed to start again this year.2. OffenseThe Orioles offense has been hitting the ball well with 44 home runs since the All-Star break, which leads all of baseball.However, as much as I do not like to say it and see them rely upon it, the Orioles need to continue to hit the home run ball. The offense cannot produce wins without home runs, so even though I do not like it, the Orioles need to depend upon\xc2\xa0home runs to win.Fortunately\xc2\xa0for the Orioles, they excel in hitting home runs; and if they are going to extend their division lead going into the dreadful September schedule, home runs are going to help push them forward. \xe2\x80\x9cThese extra-base hits not only score runs, but keep runners on base to keep pressure on the opposing pitchers\xe2\x80\x9dAlong with the home runs, the Orioles are simply getting extra-base hits. These extra-base hits not only score runs, but keep runners on base to keep pressure on the opposing pitchers.They may not be using small ball to score runs, but the Orioles have been hitting more doubles and running the bases well. The home runs are a big part of the offense, but the other extra-base hits are showing up more and more.A sign of a strong team has been aggressive base running. The Orioles are scoring from first on doubles and scoring from second on singles, because they are aggressive and recognize who the outfielders are so they can successfully do this.3. AL East DominanceThe Orioles have had a consistent dominance over their division rivals, and with the 27 games against them through the rest of the season, this trend will secure the Orioles the division crown.14 of those games are against the Yankees or Blue Jays, which as they are both more than eight games back, the Orioles can easily knock them out of contention.The Orioles have a 30-19 record against the AL East with 56 home runs while allowing 52. The offense has scored 217 runs against their own division, with only the Blue Jays scoring more runs than the Orioles in the season series so far.The Orioles pitching has an overall 3.42 ERA against the AL East. The Blue Jays are the only team that the Orioles have an ERA higher than four against. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no way they cannot take the division\xe2\x80\x9dIn the search for the division crown, if the Orioles win a majority of their games against the AL East, there is no way they cannot take the division.These three things have allowed the Orioles to begin to run away with the AL East. And if they continue to do them, the Orioles are well on their way to the divisional crown.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAt this point, the AL East title is a foregone conclusion for the Baltimore Orioles. MLB.com\xe2\x80\x99s playoff odds (via Baseball Prospectus) give the team\xc2\xa0a 96.0% chance of winning the division; FanGraphs, while marginally more pessimistic at 94.5%, still believes the same. This comes as no surprise to Baltimore fans, who have witnessed the team\xe2\x80\x99s post-All Star Break hegemony and contemporaneous mediocrity from Toronto and New York. No, what the Oriole faithful care about now is how well this club will do once it reaches the postseason. That performance will hinge on several players, one of whom dominated last night.For the season as a whole, Chris Tillman has been lucky. His 3.55 ERA overshadows a 4.32 xFIP and 4.39 SIERA; the former number ranks 47th out of 94 qualified pitches, but the latter two come in at 80th and 81st, respectively. In yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game against the Chicago White Sox, however, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t derive his success from luck, but from skill: Striking out nine South Siders while only walking one, he supported his 1.13 ERA with a 2.20 xFIP and a 2.07 SIERA in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 5-1 victory.This was no fluke for Tillman. In his past five starts, he owns a 2.14 ERA, with a 2.79 xFIP and 2.78 SIERA to go along with it. Compare that to his previous 22 outings, in which he posted a 3.92 ERA, 4.71 xFIP, and 4.78 SIERA, and you see that he has made notable \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0and legitimate \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0improvements to his game. Should this trend continue, it would bear well for the Birds come October. Digging a little deeper, we see that there\xe2\x80\x99s evidence to suggest it will.Strikeouts and walks have actuated Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s step forward; whereas earlier, he\xc2\xa0fanned 14.6% of opposing batters while issuing free passes at a 9.0% rate, now he has bettered those numbers to 25.0% and 2.4%, respectively. Pinning the former two rates at 14.3% and 9.1%, respectively, Mike Podhorzer\xe2\x80\x99s xK%\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0xBB% formulas substantiate his initial struggles. Those equations don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as confidently about his recent achievements, as they think his strikeout and walk rates should be 21.0% and 6.2%, respectively; nevertheless, those still significantly exceed his theretofore rates. Moreover, looking into those statistics shows the causes of his improvements: He has accrued more swinging strikes (14.5% S/Str%, as opposed to 10.1% before) and has thrown more strikes as a whole (65.8%, as opposed to 62.2% before).Now, this is where the trends come in. As I said earlier, regular season output doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make all that much of a difference to the Orioles right now. They only care (or, at least, they\xc2\xa0should\xc2\xa0only care) about what will happen after the season\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion. So they, presumably, would like to know if Tillman has actually turned the corner, and if they should give the ball to him in Game 5 of a postseason series.Obviously, Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s aforementioned xFIP and SIERA marks give credence to his ERA, and his xK% and xBB% marks do the same for his xFIP and SIERA. But why has he seen an increase in efficacy as of late?Tillman hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gained any noticeable velocity or movement, nor has he momentously altered his pitch location. He has decreased his changeup usage a bit, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like enough to cause all this. Instead, I feel as though something else is behind this: his delivery. Look at these screenshots of him \xe2\x80\x94 first, from\xc2\xa0Opening Day\xe2\x80\x99s win over the Boston Red Sox:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Source)And, by contrast, from August 8th\xe2\x80\x99s rout of the St. Louis Cardinals:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Source)They seem fairly analogous, right? Look at Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s feet. The delivery hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, but its location has\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 he now throws further to the right of the rubber than he ever has. The data back this up too, as the following chart shows:PitchAverage Horizontal Release Point (1-22)Average Horizontal Release Point (23-27)Fourseam-2.02-2.49Sinker-2.11-2.66Changeup-2.08-2.53Curveball-2.18-2.55Cutter-2.28-2.68Does a move to the right grant someone greater ability to deceive? If the first eight years of this millennium\xc2\xa0were any indication, it does. In all seriousness, though, this strikes me as the most plausible explanation for Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s recent success, since there don\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be any others. I\xe2\x80\x99m far from an expert on the matter, but this also seems like something that Tillman can easily maintain; if he does\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 and if it continues to bring him the same results\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 he could be a weapon for the Orioles going forward.All statistics courtesy of Baseball-Reference.

They hit three homers in the game against White Sox starter Hector Noesi \xe2\x80\x94 including Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s career-high-tying 33rd home run of the season, a two-run go-ahead shot in the fourth.Chen steadied himself to record his fourth start of seven or more innings in his last five outings, winning his career-high 13th game of the season. And the Orioles\' lockdown bullpen preserved the one-run win through some tense moments late in the game.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re really good as a team,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cruz, whose majors-leading 33rd homer tied the career high he set in 2009 with the Texas Rangers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re doing the little things that matter in the end. The pitching, the bullpen, it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing to see everybody do their job and go about their business.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles (73-52) completed their first sweep of the White Sox on the road since taking all four games here on July 6-9, 1995.

Before their three game series in Chicago on Monday, the Orioles had just finished a tremendous stretch playing 36 games against above .500 teams since July 7. In that time the Orioles went 22-14. Now the Orioles have 20 consecutive games against teams with losing records, and don\xe2\x80\x99t play another winning ball club again until the Yankees come to Camden Yards on September 12. This could be an ideal time for Orioles really build some momentum to carry into the playoffs. The biggest concern for the Orioles between now and the playoffs is getting and staying healthy. The obvious example of this is Manny Machado. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take an expert to see that when Machado\xe2\x80\x99s on the field the Orioles are a much better team. He\xe2\x80\x99s a Platinum Glove winner and his extra-base power lengthens an already strong lineup. Chris Davis has done a decent job at third so far, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t replace the best fielding third-baseman in baseball. Also, Steve Pearce is a decent first baseman, but Davis has turned into one of the best fielding first-baseman in the game so having Machado on the D.L. weakens both corners of their infield. But the Orioles are going to be sure he\xe2\x80\x99s 100% before he comes back. He\xe2\x80\x99s the future face of the franchise so they have reason to be cautious. Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans hoping for a speedy recovery are probably going to be disappointed. One of the greatest strengths of late has been the starting pitching, and one of the main factors of their success has been health. The Orioles have used only 7 starters this season, including the one start T.J. McFarland made, in comparison the Yankees have used 13. The only issue could be because the starters have made the majority of their scheduled starts every starter could be at or over their career highs in innings going into October. Just to be sure everyone is fresh going into the playoffs, Buck could give certain starters extra days of rest by giving T.J. McFarland or even Steve Johnson some starts in September. The biggest issue the Orioles could have is monotony. With 37 games left and a nine game lead over the Blue Jays and Yankees the division race is relatively over. If the Orioles only win 19 of their remaining games the Yankees would need to go 29-8 the rest of the way. That\xe2\x80\x99s just not going to happen. Buck\xe2\x80\x99s challenge will be to keep the team from falling asleep at the wheel and backing into the playoffs after a lackluster month.

Looks and first impressions can often be deceiving however; at that time it looked as if the law of averages was catching up to the Orioles in that perhaps it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t their night. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked all season long about the resiliancy of this team, which is something that you need if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to sweep a team. The Orioles battled back; they cut that 2-0 lead in half in the top of the fourth, when Steve Pearce led off the inning by hitting the first pitch he saw out of the ballpark.Courtesy of Mike DiNovo-USA TODAY SportsThat seemed to wake the Orioles up for the night, as Adam Jones reached on an infield single, and Nelson Cruz then hit a deep shot over the left field wall for his 33rd home run of the season. Suddenly the Orioles held a 3-2 lead. Jones would come to the plate again to lead off the 6th, and he promptly smacked a home run of his own. And it was a good thing the Birds had that insurance run, as Chicago got one back in the last of the inning on a Garcia sac fly-RBI.We once again saw the resiliancy of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen, as Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Zach Britton teamed up to pitch 1.2 innings and struck out three between the two of them (not allowing a base runner). In Britton\xe2\x80\x99s case keep in mind that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t worked since Sunday in Cleveland, as the Orioles held sizable leads in the first two games of this series. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t skip a beat coming into the fray in a one-run game, and sent Chicago down 1-2-3 to close out the game and the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 sweep of the south siders.This of course is a fairly strange road trip for the Birds in that not only do they play two series\xe2\x80\x99 in Chicago (they\xe2\x80\x99ll start a three-game weekend series at Wrigley Field on Friday afternoon), but they also have an off day in between the two series\xe2\x80\x99. (On a side note, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of poor scheduling on MLB\xe2\x80\x99s part; granted you take days off at this point however you can get them, but it makes much more sense to have a floating day off on a travel day as opposed to when the team is staying in the same city.) So perhaps other than the fact that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t in Baltimore, they\xe2\x80\x99re staying in a hotel, and they\xe2\x80\x99re wearing road grays, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost like a homestand for the Birds in that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere.With New York losing and Toronto winning last night, the Birds now find themselves nine games in first place ahead of Toronto, with New York being 9.5 games back. Many people ask me on a daily basis if I think the Birds will win the AL East. First off, you always preface these kinds of statements with \xe2\x80\x9cyou never know what could happen, as there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of baseball yet to be played.\xe2\x80\x9d But to answer that question properly we should think backwards. They say that if you\xe2\x80\x99re within five games of first place on 9/1, you have a fighting chance. Again, you never know what happens moving forward, but we\xe2\x80\x99re only a week-and-a-half from that magic date so to speak. And the O\xe2\x80\x99s have a nine game lead as it stands today. And that\xe2\x80\x99s been achieved by being a resiliant team, which is necessary in order to sweep a team (especially on the road) as I said above. It\xe2\x80\x99s also necessary in order to play in October \xe2\x80\x93 and potentially win a championship.

Saunders has a 2.57 ERA in six appearances since joining the Tides.    Chris Jones gave up two runs in six innings for Norfolk and Preston Guilmet added a couple of scoreless innings. On offense, outfielder Dariel Alvarez and recently-claimed infielder Jimmy Paredes had a pair of hits, while Christian Walker, potential first baseman of the intermediate future, had an RBI double. Double-A: Reading (Phillies) 8, Bowie 0 Well, this is unfortunate. The Baysox got smacked around on Wednesday night despite a solid Eastern League debut from Branden Kline, promoted earlier in the day from Frederick. The O's second round pick from 2012 allowed a run on three hits and two walks in five innings, striking out two. Only two of the runs Bowie surrendered were earned. A fielding error by Niuman Romero ended up costing several runs in a five-run seventh inning, while an eighth inning error from shortstop Garabez Rosa cost another run in the eighth.    On the plus side for Bowie, the prospect from Catonsville Community College, Glynn Davis, had a couple of hits and is now batting .313 in 26 games since being promoted. High-A: Carolina (Indians) 6, Frederick 5 Twelve hits weren't quite enough and the Keys were beaten by an eighth inning single that broke a 5-5 tie. Several Keys had standout nights offensively. John Ruettiger and Lucas Herbst each had three hits on the night. Herbst added a walk and two stolen bases. Catcher Steel Russell had two hits, including his first Carolina League home run, and Trey Mancini also had a pair of hits in the loss. Low-A: Lexington (Royals) 14, Delmarva 6 Things started out rough when starter Janser Severino allowed six runs in 4.2 innings and they didn't get any better after that either. Though the Shorebirds mustered some offense of their own, led by a three RBI night from first baseman Creede Simpson, it just wasn't enough. New Shorebirds single-season hits leader Drew Dosch added another couple of hits to his record total. The 7th round pick in 2013 is now batting .322 in his first taste of professional baseball, adding 45 walks to his 156 hits.    Short Season A: Hudson Valley (Rays) 1, Aberdeen 0 It probably could have been worse than it was, but Hudson Valley only batted 1-for-13 with runners in scoring position. Aberdeen's Tanner Chleborad allowed the lone run of the game, giving up seven hits and a walk in 3.2 innings of work. Bobby Bundy pitched two scoreless innings as he works his way back up the system in his rehab assignment.

He also walked a pair of batters, and two of the hits were home runs. His ERA at the level stands at 3.57. Suk-min Yoon, who could be the next Tsuyoshi Wada, allowed a run in 1.2 innings, while Joe Saunders, the possible Brian Matusz replacement of my dreams, pitched two scoreless.    Tides hitters only mustered three hits in the whole game. One of these was an RBI single hit by Dariel Alvarez, who also walked. Double-A: Richmond (Giants) 3, Bowie 0 Against the #7 prospect in the Giants system, Clayton Blackburn, the Baysox weren't able to do a whole lot. While Bowie got seven hits in the game, only one of them was good for extra bases. Mike Yastrzemski had two hits, as did Niuman Romero, who had two hits including the lone Baysox double. They only had three at-bats with a runner in scoring position all game. The Baysox starter was Zach Davies, the #8 prospect in the O's system according to MLB.com. He didn't do so well as Blackburn, although he did strike out seven batters while allowing only two earned runs in 5.1 innings. More impressively, he had eight groundouts to two flyouts. Maybe the defense did him in. Davies, who's just 21, has a 3.03 ERA in his first taste of the Eastern League.

They had five on the night, including two by third baseman Jason Esposito. The winning run scored due to a throwing error made by Esposito.    For the Keys, Sebastian Vader allowed a run in six innings and Matt Hobgood gave up one earned run in three innings pitched. Trey Mancini, Jerome Pena, and Wynston Sawyer all had multi-hit games, with Sawyer delivering a two-run homer to give the Keys a temporary ninth inning lead. It was his fourth home run for the Keys.

Those were the only hits that the Shorebirds got in the game.    Delmarva's starter was Bennett Parry, a 40th round pick from 2011. Parry gave up three runs, two earned, on four hits and two walks, striking out ten Asheville batters in the process. Williams Louico added three scoreless innings, while Towson University product Nik Nowottnick threw a scoreless ninth. Short Season-A: Aberdeen 5, Lowell (Red Sox) 2 We have a winner, at last! The Ironbirds made the most out of seven hits, going 4-for-7 with runners in scoring position to take down the Spinners. Shortstop Stephen Wilkerson and catcher Tanner Murphy both had multi-hit games with an RBI each. Austin Anderson and Jamill Moquete also drove in a run each for Aberdeen.

08/24/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Rain and Pain on the North Side of Chicago', 'A big lead in your division in Major League Baseball is made for days like Saturday\xe2\x80\x94a day where it was predetermined from the foundations of the world that absolutely nothing was going to go well for the Baltimore Orioles.This Birds were facing a tough, young pitcher in Kyle Hendricks, but they put together five hits in the first two innings to get a pair of runs. That usually portends a good day for the Orioles, especially when the starting pitcher gets credit for the second RBI.But in the bottom of the second, when Bud Norris failed to hit his spots, he gave up a walk. Then he hit his spots and gave up three junk singles. And finally, a very poor 3-2 pitch with two outs and the bases loaded was lined into the right-field corner for a triple by Chris Coghlan\xe2\x80\x94a player who was previously 0-for-16 off Norris.At that point, the weather completely joined the conspiracy against the Baltimore Orioles. The fog rolled in, the day turned to night, and the field became a pond.The best thing the Orioles could have done at that point was acknowledge that this was a day they were the bug and not the windshield, and simply forfeit the game to come back and play another day\xe2\x80\xa6 just go get some sleep, beat the Cubs on Sunday, and go home happy from a long nine-game trip.But no, they had to play it out. And after 3:09 of rain delay, it was Ubaldo Jimenez taking over for the O\xe2\x80\x99s on the mound. Some might have expected the downpour to turn into a total hurricane at that point, but Jimenez pitched reasonably well for four innings\xe2\x80\x94giving up only one run on three hits, and only adding one walk to his league-leading total.Tommy Hunter would give up two more runs over two innings, and the offense never got back into the game at all\xe2\x80\x94tallying only two hits in the last seven innings. The final score was 7-2.And on a day like this, nobody needed to look at the scoreboard to know that both the Yankees and Blue Jays would win and draw to within seven and eight games respectively.One might ponder if the Manny Machado season-ending surgery news cast a pall over the mood along with the gloomy weather. I doubt that; it does not fit with the corporate persona of this team. It is more likely the function of the eighth game of a road trip, while being stuck in a damp and old stadium waiting half of the day for the rain to stop.Is there anything to panic about? Not really. If on March 15th I had offered you a seven-game Orioles lead in the AL East on August 24th, would you have taken it? Yep, you would have. You would have said, \xe2\x80\x9cWada opportunity!\xe2\x80\x9d And you\xe2\x80\x99d be correct again.The Orioles are facing Tsuyoshi Wada on Sunday\xe2\x80\x94the $8 million washout.

Three years ago today, we learned of the death of the now late Mike Flanagan. At the time I vowed that as long as I wrote on the Baltimore Orioles beat for Fansided, I\xe2\x80\x99d mark August 24th.Mike Flanagan is concretely cemented into the history of the franchise as one of it\xe2\x80\x99s greatest pitchers. Perhaps the \xe2\x80\x9csecond greatest,\xe2\x80\x9d after Jim Palmer. His ranking is debatable, however the fact that he meant a lot to the franchise and to the fans from the mid-to-late 70\xe2\x80\x99s and through the late 80\xe2\x80\x99s is not in question. Flanagan was the definition of a crafty lefty who always seemed to have a trick up his sleeve \xe2\x80\x93 especially in his Cy Young year of 1979.Flanagan was also very active in the community, and when he came up with the Orioles he moved to Baltimore and lived here until his death in 2011. Granted at that time it was much more common for players to do that, however Flanagan was one of the more visible Orioles throughout the area during his tenure with the Birds.The details of Flanagan\xe2\x80\x99s death are still somewhat nebulous, however that\xe2\x80\x99s not important. Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans should be celebrating his life, and what he meant to them as opposed to anything else. For the record, Flanagan\xe2\x80\x99s death seemed to somehow rally the team that year, and they completed perhaps the greatest closing act of all time just over a month after that by beating Boston to knock them out of the playoff race. A season later, the O\xe2\x80\x99s made the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. And here they are again now, poised to go into the post season.Mike Flanagan loved this franchise. I think he would be proud to see how things have turned out in the span between three years ago todayCourtesy of Brace Hemmelgarn-USA TODAY Sportsand now.  His devotion to the Orioles is best summed up by his comments regarding his slow walk in from the bullpen as he became the final Oriole to pitch at Memorial Stadium in 1991: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6if I had walked any faster, I would have fallen over.\xe2\x80\x9d At that time Flanagan had returned to the O\xe2\x80\x99s after having been traded to Toronto in 1987. He re-signed with the O\xe2\x80\x99s as a free agent prior to the 1991 season, and was largely used as a reliever. Manager Johnny Oates summoned Flanagan from the bullpen to pitch to Detroit in the top of the ninth inning with the Orioles trailing \xe2\x80\x93 thus making him the final Oriole to pitch on the hallowed ground of 33rd St.As Flanagan walked in from the bullpen that day (in the aforementioned slow manner), you could almost see the old \xe2\x80\x9cghosts\xe2\x80\x9d of the franchise\xe2\x80\x99s storied past rooting him on.\xc2\xa0He was very much a piece of the franchise\xe2\x80\x99s history (as a World Series championship and the Cy Young award), but also at that moment a piece of it\xe2\x80\x99s present. He was thus the perfect person to have the honor of being the last man standing on the mound. And it\xe2\x80\x99s an honor that we all know he took very seriously.But the real tragedy is that he\xe2\x80\x99s no longer with us. Again, the manner in which he died isn\xe2\x80\x99t important. We mourn his death, but we always keep his memory in our hearts. The Orioles organization was shaken to it\xe2\x80\x99s core by Flanagan\xe2\x80\x99s passing, however if results are any indication it acted as a flash point for it\xe2\x80\x99s return to glory. And there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in this world that would make Mike Flanagan more proud than to see that the process completed \xe2\x80\x93 this October. Rest in eternal peace Mike, we miss you.

However Norris of course was lifted from the game after the lengthy rain delay, for his own safety more than anything else. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to Norris in a moment, as he had somewhat of a fascinating outing\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6following a Nick Markakis strikeout the O\xe2\x80\x99s got back-to-back doubles from Steve Pearce and Adam Jones which gave them a 1-0 lead.

Three hours plus later, the teams re-emerged from their clubhouses.

In fact, I would submit that he gave the Orioles a decent shot at winning \xe2\x80\x93 had the bats come alive later in the game, that is. Jimenez gave up a walk in the sixth, and after a Valaika RBI-single that walk came into score. Tommy Hunter would also give up a Baez homer and an RBI-single by Watkins later in the game, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s found themselves on the short end once again, 7-2.The real key to this game was the unsettled second inning by Bud Norris. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that in an accusatory manner. Norris didCourtesy of Jon Durr-USA TODAY SportsEVERYTHING in his power to get Chicago out. He actually looked like he had decent stuff yesterday in his limited appearance. However Chicago produced a few lengthy at-bats against him in that second inning, fouling off pitch after pitch after pitch. A couple of infield hits and soft liners later, and the bases were loaded. And by soft liners I mean that had they been hit just a little harder the outfielders would have caught the ball.This is part of the game, and Norris and Buck Showalter would be the first to say that. But at a certain point it also becomes frustrating from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 perspective given the fact that guys are getting on base on such softly hit balls. Not only that, but we saw Chicago hitters wear Norris down in that fifty-pitch or so second inning, when in fact it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be the other way around. So Norris and in that sense the Orioles found themselves as victims of circumstance; but again, that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the game.The Birds will have to make a roster move prior to this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s series finale, activating Miguel Gonzalez who will make the start. They will probably option a reliever, although keep in mind that whomever goes down will probably come right back at some point after rosters expand on September 1st. The Orioles will face their former farmhand, Tsuyioshi Wada, who of course was in the organization for two years but never made it to the big leagues due to injury.

He is 4-0 in eight starts since July 18.""All our pitchers have been good,"" Hardy said, ""but every fifth day when he takes the mound we feel like we\'ve got a great chance to win.""Baltimore led 3-1 before pulling away in the fifth. Three straight singles produced a run before Young hit a three-run drive to left. Hardy chased Odorizzi with a shot to center, and Davis greeted Kirby Yates with his 22nd home run.It was the first time since May 2012 that the Orioles homered in three successive at-bats.Odorizzi yielded eight runs and 11 hits, both career highs, as were the four home runs.""Jake has been hit a little bit this year, but he hasn\'t been hit like that in a long while,"" manager Joe Maddon said.Odorizzi said: ""It was an overall lousy night. I\'m frustrated because I feel like I let the guys down.

Jones then threw out Matt Joyce, who tagged up from first base.After the Rays scored in the third, Baltimore went up 3-1 in the bottom half. Markakis snapped an 0-for-21 skid with a two-run drive and Pearce followed with his 15th homer, the fourth in his last eight games.TRAINER\'S ROOMRays: C Ryan Hanigan (left oblique strain) could return from the disabled list as soon as Tuesday, Maddon said. But OF David DeJesus (left hand fracture) likely wouldn\'t be activated until rosters expand on Sept. 1.

However yesterday afternoon the city of Chicago returned the favor in the form of it\xe2\x80\x99s north side team completing the sweep of the Birds.  Needless to say, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are probably happy to shake the \xe2\x80\x9cFriendly Confines\xe2\x80\x9d and get back to Baltimore to play in front of friendly faces \xe2\x80\x93 as Buck Showalter says. Miguel Gonzalez was called back up from the minors to make the start yesterday. (In a corresponding move, Cord Phelps was optioned to triple-A Norfolk.) Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.1 IP, 6 H, 2 R, 0 BB, 3 K. Gonzalez pitched a great game, needless to say. However his mound opponent, former Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 farmhand Tsuyioshi Wada, pitched just a bit better. Wada had a no-hitter going until the seventh inning. However I would submit that Wada only really did one thing better than Gonzalez last night/; he took advantage of the large strike zone. Home plate umpire Dan Iassongna has a reputation as being a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s umpire.Courtesy of Jon Durr-USA TODAY SportsIn effect, Wada pitched to what the zone actually was as opposed to Gonzalez who pitched to what he and most people thought the zone should have actually been. Wada also had some very striking late movement on his pitches, which seemed to fool Oriole hitters all day long. Having said that, Gonzalez kept Chicago bats at bay for most of the game as well. So in writing this I also want to be very clear in that the Orioles couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have asked for more out of Gonzalez coming back to the big league level than what he gave them yesterday.Chicago took a 1-0 lead in the fifth on an Alcantara solo homer, to which Rizzo would add an RBI-double in the last of the sixth. Steve Pearce would smack a homer into the left field grandstand in the seventh inning, which attests for the lone Oriole hit on the day. The fact is that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 achilles heel has been afternoon games, and games against pitchers and teams against whom they have little to no history. So this series fit the bill for the Orioles to be swept. All in all, this is the first losing road trip for this team on the season, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the first time they\xe2\x80\x99ve been swept since playing Detroit in May.The prevailing sentiment among fans seems to be that this team has seen the wind leave it\xe2\x80\x99s sails with the Manny Machado news coming own the wire over the weekend. The loss of Machado makes the road a lot tougher for sure. But keep in mind that the O\xe2\x80\x99s do have a winning record without Machado in the lineup this year. Furthermore, even if they don\xe2\x80\x99t make a deal this week for some infield help, rosters will expand one week from today and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to bring some guys up from the minors to help as well.The Birds begin a four-game series at home tonight against Tampa. They\xe2\x80\x99ll look for Chris Tillman to be their stopper in order to halt this sudden three-game losing streak. Tillman will be opposed by Tampas\xe2\x80\x99s Jake Odorizzi.

They are constantly being called up, sent down and designated for assignment. For players drafted in the 42nd round, the chance to be called up even once is a downright impossible dream. Brad Brach has beaten the odds to not only make it to the bigs, but stick on a playoff-contending roster.    Name: Brad Brach Number: 35Born: April 12, 1986 (28 years old) in Freehold, NJHeight: 6\'6"" Weight: 215 lbsBats: Right Throws: RightDrafted: by the San Diego Padres in the 42nd round of the 2008 draftSchool: Freehold Township High School (Freehold, NJ)Monmouth University (West Long Branch, NJ)Contract: $509,500 in 2014 (Arbitration Eligible: 2016, Free Agent: 2019)Became an Oriole: Traded on November 25, 2013 by the Padres to the Orioles in exchange for minor league pitcher Devin JonesTwitter: @BradBrach35 Boyhood Fandom Freehold, NJ is about an hour away from the Big Apple. So Brad was raised as a big New York Mets fan. Unfortunately, the Mets kinda stunk when he was a kid (believe me, I understand you, Brad). So, in addition to his squad, he decided to root for the team that would beat the Yankees. If we travel back to the early and mid 90s, that team was the Baltimore Orioles. Brach followed the everyday movement of the O\'s and became a huge Cal Ripken Jr. fan. If you sweep through his twitter feed you can find a picture of\xc2\xa0him and his family at Camden Yards and one of him, horizontally, wearing a Ripken jersey.    ""(Ripken) played hard every single day and was someone I aspired to be like,"" Brach told Padres360.com last year. ""He was an All-Star when I was growing up and was out there every single day.    A World Without Baseball Brach told MLB.com\'s Britt Ghiroli that if he weren\'t fortunate enough to be a big leaguer that he would likely become a teacher. He has a degree from Monmouth University in history education. He would like to get a position at a high school so that he could teach and coach both basketball and baseball. He was named second-team all district in basketball as a high school student. And his profile on the Monmouth University sports page informed us that he amassed 147 rebounds and 86 three-point field goals. I have no clue how good that is but the dude is 6\'6"" so I\'m sure he can play some b-ball.    Friendly Competition The Brach family is pretty into this whole baseball thing. While we all know by now that Brad is major league reliever, it is also of note that his little brother, Brett is a professional baseball player too, kind of. The younger Brach was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 10th round of the 2009 draft after he attended Monmouth like his brother. Unfortunately, things haven\'t gone quite as well for Brett. He has been out of affiliated ball since July 10 when he pitched for the Nationals double-A team, Harrisburg, against the Baysox. The two crossed paths once this season. Brad was down with Norfolk when Brett\'s Columbus Clippers (Indians affiliate) came into town. The teams split the series and Brett never made an appearance. Brad threw 1.2 innings and gave up three runs.    Nashville Party In the offseason, Brach does not return to his childhood home of New Jersey. Nor does he head to Arizona, where his parents now live. He goes to the homeland of country music, Nashville. This is where he owns a house with his wife, Jenae Cherry. The couple met there in August of 2011 when Brad was in Tennessee with the Triple-A Tucson Padres to play the Nashville Sounds. He went out to a little bar where Cherry was strumming her acoustic guitar and crooning to the country tunes. He asked her out to lunch and the rest is history. At one time, Cherry thought she wanted to become a nurse but after one year of school at Northern Illinois University traded her stethoscope for a guitar; a pink guitar. She plays five nights a week in Nashville and Brad is there every night he can be in the off-season. If you want to learn more about Jenae and her music, which I know you do, check out\xc2\xa0her website. There is a piece by MLB.com\'s Corey Brock that is a good introduction to the couple. But if ya don\'t want to, here is the synopsis: They inspire one another, they have a dog; a Dachshund/Lab mix named Belle, and they put up a pink tree at Christmas time. Quick Facts -Favorite food: Pizza or ice cream-Favorite movie: Remember the Titans-Brad has made his own CD. He recorded a rap with two of his friends growing up but he is apparently not very fond of it. He will let his wife be the musically inclined one in the house.-Prized possession: His wife\'s first album (what a nice guy!)-He shares his birthday with Brennan Boesch, Justin Ruggiano and Hisashi Iwakuma-Brach attended the same high school as Val Majewski. Remember him? In 2004 he played in nine games with the Orioles and batted .154. At one point, he was the O\'s fourth best prospect, according the Baseball America. An injury in 2005 derailed his career.-Brach made his Major League debut as a Padre on August 31, 2011 as a 25 year old against he Dodgers. He threw one and on-third inning, striking out three and giving up two hits and one walk but no runs. Current Oriole Nick Hundley also made an appearance in that game as a pinch hitter for San Diego    Overview Very little could have been expected from Brach when he was traded for back in November. He had struggled to stick with San Diego, a team that plays in one of the most pitcher-friendly parks in the game. A switch to the bandbox that is Camden Yards seemed insurmountable. However, his immediate excitement about the move was encouraging. He went right to Twitter to explain how enthralled he was with the chance to be an Oriole and his performance has made fans just as excited to have him. In his last 10 appearances he has allowed two hits, four walks and no runs while striking out 14. He is a bullpen arm. One who is lights out today, may be gone tomorrow, but he seems like one of the good guys in the game and I\'m happy to have him.

On each occasion the Birds have come back with a win.It looked immediately to be a game the Orioles were going to need a great effort from their starter. Tampa Bay starter Jake Odorizzi came in as the #4 pitcher in the American League in strikeouts-per-nine-innings at 10.1, and he was off to a good beginning. He struck out three Birds in the first two innings, and Tampa Bay opened to a 1-0 lead with an unearned run.But in the end, Odorizzi would stink up the joint by giving up eight runs on 11 hits in just four innings. Having yielded an average of only one home run in every 10 innings this year, the Orioles touched him for four of them: a two-run blast by Nick Markakis, followed by a huge homer by Steve Pearce; and then later the big blow of a three-run moon-shot by Delmon Young with an immediate reprise by J.J. Hardy. After a pitching change, Chris Davis made it three in a row for the Orioles, and the final score of 9-1 was registered. \xc2\xa0Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireAs much as Saturday night\xe2\x80\x99s debacle with lucky Cubs\xe2\x80\x99 hits and the weather descending upon the Orioles was clearly a no-win scenario for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, this evening was just the opposite.

So let me explain why it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter much:History. The Orioles were only playing their second series ever at Wrigley Field in the 100 years history of the iconic ballpark. Sure some of the players had played there before, such as Nelson Cruz (who played there last year with the Rangers) and Steve Pearce (with the Pirates). But the team seemed to be intimidated by the small bandbox. The bullpen is practically in the field of play, fans are right on top of the players and the place really seems to be a stadium out of time.

They just had a grudge and wanted to play their best against the team that gave up on them. Throw in the erratic Pedro Strop and the Orioles were just not welcomed by their old teammates.Long Road series. It was a long time to be away from home. First Cleveland, then a week in Chicago playing in two different stadiums. It certainly had to make the team homesick near the end. Baseball always has long road trips, but the extra-long time spent in the Windy City pushed them to the breaking point.It was time.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsIt\xe2\x80\x99s close to playoff time. The Baltimore Orioles know it, and their fans do too. Since I count myself as a member of the latter group, I want the team to go far once it inevitably reaches the postseason; since I am one of the more sabermetrically-inclined members of said group, I like to analyze the statistics of various players, to predict the level of their contribution (or lack thereof) to the club\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical October success. Last week, I looked at Chris Tillman, whose current hot streak gave me hope for his future; today, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn in the opposite direction, and examine Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x98s slump.By now, you\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously heard about Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding season with the Orioles. Regardless of where he ends up, the one-year, $8 million contract he signed will almost certainly be a significant underpay. Currently, his WAR sits at a healthy 2.5; even if he plays poorly enough in September to bring that down to, say, two wins, the Orioles will have still paid about $4 million per win. Last offseason, depending on which methodology you use, a win cost an average of at least $5 million, and probably something closer to $6 million.But the bargain of Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s deal won\xe2\x80\x99t offer the Orioles much solace if the Oakland Athletics or Detroit Tigers knock them out in the divisional round. No, the Birds care about what Cruz will do for them going forward, and if that means more of what he\xe2\x80\x99s done lately, they\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be better off without him.Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a step back. On July 7th, in the first of three games against the Washington Nationals, Cruz had three hits, one of which left the yard, in five trips to the dish. That successful outing pumped his triple-slash up to .294/.359/.591, with a .405 wOBA and a 160 wRC+. Suffice to say, he was hitting well. Since then\xe2\x80\xa6not so much. In the past month-and-a-halfish, he has utterly collapsed; his batting line for the games since then is a sickly .160/.241/.319, which translates to a .250 wOBA and a 53 wRC+. Because of this, his seasonal stats (.254/.323/.510, .358 wOBA, 127 wRC+) are much worse than they were when Baltimore began The Battle of the Beltways.So will Cruz bust out of this funk? And if he does, will he be the dominant Cruz the Orioles had earlier, or the cromulent one he\xe2\x80\x99s been for the season as a whole? Let\xe2\x80\x99s compare his stats from before and after July 8th. We\xe2\x80\x99ll start with the core four: strikeout and walk rates, batting average on balls in play, and isolated power.PeriodPABB%K%ISOBABIP3/31-7/73799.0%19.8%.297.3007/9-8/251628.6%21.6%.160.162The first thing I noticed is that, unlike his slump-mate Chris Davis, Cruz hasn\xe2\x80\x99t fanned much more often despite his hitting woes. Furthermore, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen a dropoff in free passes, as the above numbers would have you think; while pitchers intentionally walked him seven times in the first sample, they have done so only once since. This means that his unintentional walk rate has actually increased, from 7.3% to 8.1%. Removing the walks for which he didn\xe2\x80\x99t work also changes his pre- and post-downturn strikeout rates to 20.2% and 21.7%, respectively \xe2\x80\x94 even less of a difference. As a whole, though, his plate discipline hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.A quick look at PITCHf/x confirms this stagnation:PeriodO-Swing%Z-Swing%Swing%O-Contact%Z-Contact%Contact%Zone%3/31-7/732.6%69.2%50.1%54.7%84.8%74.6%47.8%7/9-8/2533.4%66.8%47.9%53.9%88.3%74.7%43.4%He swings at about the same amount of pitches outside the zone (which explains the mostly equal walk rate), and his sudden ability to make more contact offsets his newfound willingness to take looking strikes (which explains the mostly equal strikeout rate).The change, then, comes from Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s BABIP and ISO, which have declined precipitously\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the former, from elite level to about major-league-average; the latter, from about major-league-average to abysmal. His batted-ball profile helps to confirm this shift:PeriodLD%GB%FB%IFFB%HR/FB3/31-7/717.20%40.30%42.50%10.50%24.60%7/9-8/2511.70%38.70%49.50%12.70%10.90%Since August 9th, Cruz has simply stopped hitting line drives, in favor of fly balls, killing his BABIP in the process. This might pay off as a means of selling out for power, except that his greater quantity of air balls hasn\xe2\x80\x99t brought with it quality.Before Cruz donned the Baltimore orange, his fly balls went an average of 300.6 feet. From the beginning of the season to July 7th, he did slightly better than that, with 303.2 feet of distance; from July 9th until now, he has done considerably worse than that, with 278.4 feet of distance. To put those numbers in perspective: The former, for the full 2014 campaign, would rank 11th among all hitters, the latter 148th. 281 players have come to bat so far, so he has basically declined from the 96th percentile to the 47th.Cruz also hasn\xe2\x80\x99t hit the ball harder lately. Prior to his game on July 7th, his well-hit average (the percentage of his at-bats that ended with a hard-hit ball) stood at 20.7%, 30th in baseball. By Monday, it was 19.0%, good for 54th. That\xe2\x80\x99s for 2014 as a whole, not just the span of his slump; this means that he has made even weaker contact as of late.\xc2\xa0While WHAV isn\xe2\x80\x99t yet a scientific or non-proprietary statistic, his relatively low ranking in it (along with his aforementioned shorter fly balls) would seem to, unfortunately, give credit to his depreciation.Again, though, we care about what Cruz will do going forward. Do these developments cast doubt on his potential to improve the club in the short- or long-term?Well, a major-league-average non-pitcher strikes out in 19.8% of his plate appearances. So if Cruz sustains this pace of punchouts, he\xe2\x80\x99ll only be marginally worse than that. We can say the same about his unintentional free pass clip, which\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 if it hangs around its current area \xe2\x80\x94 should compare fairly well to the MLB-wide 7.3% figure.However, the plate appearances in which he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t strike out or walk don\xe2\x80\x99t inspire confidence. And while poor fortune undoubtedly plays a role in his recent struggles\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 no hitter has a true-talent .162 BABIP\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 his peripherals show a changed man, one who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t possess nearly the clout that he did earlier in the year, or even before that. For a player who derives all of his value from his bat, and who derives all of\xc2\xa0that\xc2\xa0value from his power, this could be disaster. Hopefully, the Orioles realize this, and act accordingly.All statistics courtesy of Baseball-Reference. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAfter a long road trip, the Baltimore Orioles are so glad to be at home that they pulled out a 4-2 victory over the Rays by getting three outs at home!Did you follow that?If you were able to watch the whole game on Tuesday night, you were able to see three of the best plays at home plate by a catcher as could be imagined in a single game. Caleb Joseph has had an amazing season defensively for the Orioles since he joined the team upon the season-ending injury to Matt Wieters.The three plays to Joseph were:In the first inning \xe2\x80\x93 a 5-3-2 play from Chris Davis to Steve Pearce on a ground ball while Desmond Jennings attempted to take home on the throw. It was a very close play, but the throw and tag were flawless, as was Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s positioning at the plate.In the second inning \xe2\x80\x93 an 8-2 play, as Ryan Hanigan attempted to score from second base on a two-out single by Desmond Jennings. Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 low bouncing throw came right to Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s glove on the sliding Hanigan.In the seventh inning \xe2\x80\x93 a 5-2 play with a bare-handed grab by Chris Davis of a slow bounder toward third. Joseph short-hopped the catch for a bases-loaded force out.But not only did Caleb Joseph protect home, he brought home the first two Orioles runs in the fourth inning with a line drive to center field that just barely fell in. With two outs, this was a huge hit, putting the O\xe2\x80\x99s ahead 2-1. \xc2\xa0The Orioles are 14-1 when Joseph has an RBI in a game.And again in the bottom of the sixth inning (and again) with two outs and Chris Davis on first base, Caleb Joseph extended the inning with a solid single. This too proved to be a big hit, keeping the inning going for Jonathan Schoop to follow with another single to drive in the tie-breaking run that would prove to be the game-winner.This sixth-inning damage was done off Grant Balfour, who was the eventual losing pitcher. He is now 1-6 with a 5.54 ERA.\xc2\xa0 Remember when Dan Duquette and the Warehouse were criticized for not signing Balfour. Instead it was a relative no-name like Brad Brach who ended up in the O\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen \xe2\x80\x93 where tonight he improved his record to 5-0 with a 2.47 ERA.Though a big win for the Orioles who pick up a game on the Yankees, it was a deliberative, methodical, and even tedious game that lasted 3.5 hours. Each team ran lots of deep counts and extended at-bats. Rays starter Alex Cobb was out of the game after four innings, having already thrown 92 pitches. Wei-Yin Chen also had command troubles, though he pitched out of a lot of trouble on an evening he did not have his best stuff.Game three of the four-game series will continue on Wednesday night with Kevin Gausman going against Drew Smyly.This will be Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s 15th start of the year. He is 7-5 with a 3.81 ERA. He pitched two games against the Rays in late June with opposite results \xe2\x80\x93 winning one by giving up no runs in six innings, while getting hit hard on the second occasion with five runs on seven hits in five innings.Combined between Detroit and Tampa Bay, Smyly is 8-10 with a 3.42 ERA. Two of his eight wins this year are against the Orioles. The first of these was through three scoreless innings of middle relief in the third game of the year for the Tigers. He later started a game versus the O\xe2\x80\x99s and only gave up one run in six innings \xe2\x80\x93 a first-inning homer by Adam Jones.

The left-hander struck out six and walked one.Smyly is 3-1 with a 1.50 ERA with Tampa Bay. In his previous start, he tossed a two-hitter against Toronto for his first career complete game.Although it\'s too early to start comparing Smyly to Price, there\'s reason to believe the Rays landed a gem in the three-team deal that sent Price to the Tigers and netted the Rays three players: Smyly, infielder Nick Franklin and shortstop Willy Adames.""David Price is one of the best in the game,"" Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy said. ""It\'s nice we don\'t have to see him all the time. Smyly\'s a great pitcher. It doesn\'t get much easier.""In 18 career appearances against AL East teams, Smyly is 6-0 with a 1.32 ERA. That does not bode well beyond this season for the division-leading Orioles.""Certainly, the future looks bright for him and Tampa having him in the rotation,"" Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said, ""but we\'ll see what baseball longevity has to say. He obviously has a chance to be a good one. Already is.""Brad Boxberger worked the eighth and Jake McGee got three outs to complete the two-hitter and earn his 15th save.""It\'s probably one of the better stretches I\'ve had as a starter,"" Smyly said. ""Really, since the All-Star break I\'ve felt like I\'ve kind of turned the page and done pretty well. That\'s what you look for, you try to get on a good roll, a good rhythm, and try to carry them over.""Coincidentally, Price gave up eight runs and 12 hits on Wednesday night against the Yankees.The Orioles have lost four of six, but can capture the four-game series with a victory Thursday night.Rookie Kevin Gausman (7-6) labored through four innings, allowing two earned runs on six hits before being lifted after 80 pitches. The right-hander is 1-3 with a 6.75 ERA in five career outings against the Rays.""It would have been very easy to run him back out there,"" Showalter said. ""It just seemed like there weren\'t a whole lot of unchallenging outs.""Gausman was optioned to the Gulf Coast Orioles after the game, but will surely return when rosters expand on Monday.Evan Longoria had three hits for the Rays, who won for only the fourth time in 11 games. Tampa Bay scored all its runs in the first two innings and Smyly made the margin stand.Tampa Bay scored twice in the first inning on an RBI grounder by Matt Joyce and a single by Wil Myers. The Rays might have had more if Longoria and Joyce didn\'t both end up at third base on a single by James Loney.Ben Zobrist delivered a sacrifice fly in the top of the second, and Davis\' 23rd home run made it 3-1 in the bottom half.TRAINER\'S ROOMRays: Longoria returned to 3B after playing two straight days as a DH because of forearm tightness.

08/28/2014,"[('Orioles, Yankees game on September 14 at Camden Yards ...', "" Here's the good news: The Orioles, who have not been good at home on Sundays, have just had one of their remaining Sunday afternoon games moved to Sunday night. That means that they'll be on ESPN on September 14 at 8 o'clock, giving everyone out of market the chance to watch on an actual TV.    Here's the bad news: This will be the final game that Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter will play in Baltimore. So you're probably better off watching on mute, and only tuning in well after the inevitable pre-game presentation of whatever gift the Orioles end up giving him. Unless for some reason they take up Buck Showalter's idea of presenting Jeter with a signed photo of the Jeffrey Maier catch. The September 14 game will be the last game of what's become a four-game series against the Yankees, with a make-up game to be played on the afternoon of September 12 as part of a day-night doubleheader. They'll still have four games at Yankee Stadium to be played against the current second place team in the division. In their previous two Sunday Night Baseball games this season, the Orioles have gone 1-1, losing a barf-worthy walk-off in Boston on April 20 and winning a rain-shortened five inning game on July 13 against the Yankees. Can we get on ESPN on a Sunday night without either the Yankees or the Red Sox being involved? Apparently not.     "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Problems with good pitching', 'As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all season long, good pitching will generally shut down good hitting. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it all season long, and it\xe2\x80\x99s generally been the case since the beginning of time in baseball. We saw it again last night with the Baltimore Orioles, as they fell 3-1 to Tampa \xe2\x80\x93 who\xe2\x80\x99s starter Drew Smyly seemed to dominate the Orioles and in effect shut down everything they tried to do. The issue of course is that once they get into the postseason, the Birds will be seeing that caliber of pitching in every game.Kevin Gausman was done in by a 34 pitch first inning, in which he yielded two runs. In typical Tampa style, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t hit the ball hard, or too far (for the most part). And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of what frustrates teams about Tampa overall; it\xe2\x80\x99s almost more acceptable to lose to a team that\xe2\x80\x99s tagging pitch after pitch. But when you lose to guys who are just barely getting dropping the ball over the infielders\xe2\x80\x99 heads for base hits, it\xe2\x80\x99s borderline embarrassing. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4 IP, 6 H, 3 R (2 earned) 0 BB, 4 K. Again, the 34 pitch first inning was the key for Gausman, who after the game insisted that he\xe2\x80\x99s not starting to tire.  And I would tend to agree with him; as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s hitters wear out your pitching with the number of times they foul pitches off, take pitches, and just hack at balls just to stay alive. (In turn, their pitchers seem to wear out your hitters when they\xe2\x80\x99re at the plate.)Tampa scored in the first inning when Matt Joyce grounded to Jonathan Schoop with Ben Zobrist on third. Schoop, I suppose recalling howCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsoften Tampa runners had already been nailed at the plate in this series, opted to throw home instead of taking the sure out at first base. Zobrist slid in under Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x98s tag, giving Tampa a 1-0 lead. That\xe2\x80\x99s a rookie mistake on Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s part, as eventually he\xe2\x80\x99ll learn that you can\xe2\x80\x99t try to force plays as such. Evan Longoria followed suit with a single, as did James Loney\xe2\x80\xa6at which point Longoria returned the favor with a bone headed play of his own. On Myers\xe2\x80\x99 single Tampa held their runners as as not to test Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x98 arm. Longoria apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the memo, and was tagged out at third base \xe2\x80\x93 where of course Joyce was already standing. Will Myers would add an RBI-single before the innnig was over to give Tampa a 2-0 lead, which an inning later would run to 3-1 on a Ben Zorist sac fly-RBI.The lone Oriole run came on a Chris Davis line drive homer in the last of the second, which also closed out the scoring for the day overall. So you can look at it from the perspective that a bad two innings did Gausman and the Orioles in. And when you produce the caliber of pitching that Tampa seems to produce, you can afford to take the attitude that in scoring one run that means the other side has to score two to beat you. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re a frustrating team to play.The series concludes tonight at 7 PM with Bud Norris on the hill for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s Jeremy Hellickson. The good news for the O\xe2\x80\x99s is that New York plays at 1 PM today, so they\xe2\x80\x99ll already know the result of that game going in. For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, New York will head to Toronto for the weekend, while the O\xe2\x80\x99s will welcome in Minnesota. Prior to the game the Orioles sent Wei-Yin Chen down to the Gulf Coast Orioles, and recalled catcher Steve Clevenger from Norfolk. Chen will be eligible to be recalled on September 1st when rosters expand, so call this merely a move on paper.

The Orioles defeated the Rays 9-1. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWhat will it take for the Baltimore Orioles, or any other team for that matter, to win it all? The answer to this question can be defined in sabermetrical terms, though I want to speak of it more generically and defer most of the statistics for analysis at another time.To win short series we know it takes good starting pitching, timely hitting, and shut-down bullpens. But even some of the best teams with rosters brimming with players such as these will sometimes not breeze through to championships.What is needed is for a majority of players on a team to be performing at the top of, or above, their historic statistical average level of play.Look at the 2013 Red Sox. It was a nice roster, though certainly it was not one that would have been selected by many to have the season that they put together, culminating in the World Series Championship. But a number of the players had career years, and they cumulatively put together a strong effort toward the end of the season.This is true when looking back at each of the past four World Series champions, examining the records over their final 20 and 30 games of the regular season \xe2\x80\xa6TEAM\xc2\xa0 Final 20 Games \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Final 30 Games2013 Red Sox\xc2\xa0 12-8\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa020-102012 Giants\xc2\xa0 14-6\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa020-102011 Cardinals\xc2\xa0 15-5\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa021-92010 Giants\xc2\xa0 12-8\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa020-10\xc2\xa0Can the Baltimore Orioles be a team like this? They actually have been for some time now. Over the past 20 games they are 14-6, and over they have a record of 33-17 over the past 50 games. But the O\xe2\x80\x99s are going to need to sustain this pace and not simply limp home with a narrow divisional title.And are the Orioles a squad with a strong majority of players performing at the top of their historic mid-range performance, or even definitely above average? Let\xe2\x80\x99s think it through\xe2\x80\xa6Starting Pitching \xe2\x80\x93 It is certainly true that, particularly over the past two months, the starting pitchers have performed above the level of their historic numbers. Chris Tillman is now throwing at a level equal to his best season last year. Miguel Gonzalez, Budd Norris, and Wei-Yin Chen are generally all pitching somewhat above historic norms. Of course, Ubaldo Jimenez is another story altogether, and Kevin Gausman is essentially learning on the job.Relief Pitching \xe2\x80\x93 Without doubt, the bullpen is performing at an extremely high level. Exceptions might be Tommy Hunter and Brian Matusz, though they are not regular liabilities. Brad Brach and T.J. McFarland have given some very effective length and bridged the gap from a weak start on many occasions. And Andrew Miller, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, and Zach Britton are throwing at the very best levels of their respective careers. This bullpen has not been overused, nor will they now be with the addition of arms in the expanded rosters.Hitting \xe2\x80\x93 It is hit and miss (get it?). Yes, way too many misses in several situations. How many Orioles hitters are having career years? Steve Pearce is for sure. Can you name another? Producing in line with historic numbers would be Adam Jones, Nick Markakis, J.J. Hardy, and Delmon Young when he plays. I did not include Nelson Cruz. He had a career first half of the season, and it likely saved the Orioles from early destruction; but he has not hit anywhere near his historic average for many weeks now. Not to dump on Chris Davis, but even a .250 average over the rest of 2014 would make a huge difference in what has been a precipitous drop-off from 2013. And we can put Jonathan Schoop and Caleb Joseph in the same category as Gausman in terms of learning on the job. \xc2\xa0 More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryThough no one can predict the future with certainty, there is reason to believe that the total pitching component of the Orioles will stay competitive through to the final game.

A switch-hitter, he does perhaps provide more of an option off of the bench, assuming he is capable at all of hitting from either side of the plate, which he has not exactly demonstrated in limited action scattered across four big league seasons.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 If one was to judge Chris Davis\' season solely by comparing his current numbers to last year\'s figures, it would appear as if the Baltimore Orioles slugger is performing miserably.That would be far from the truth. In spite of his embarrassing .189 batting average, Davis has been a significant contributor to the AL East leaders.Davis hit his fourth career grand slam, and the Orioles got a dominating pitching performance from Miguel Gonzalez in a 9-1 victory over the skidding Minnesota Twins on Friday night.Baltimore\'s fourth win in five games was marred by an injury to first baseman Steve Pearce, who left with a right abdominal strain. The severity of the injury will be determined by an MRI on Saturday morning, and the Orioles can only hope for the best after losing third baseman Manny Machado for the season earlier this month.""I\'m just hoping it\'s a day or two thing,"" Pearce said. ""I\'m not feeling any pain or anything, just discomfort.""If Pearce is sidelined for a spell, Davis will do his best to make sure there\'s no reduction in the team\'s offensive output. He has 14 hits in August, seven of them home runs, and has accounted for 24 of Baltimore\'s major-league leading 172 home runs.Davis batted .286 with 53 homers and 138 RBIs in 2013. He\'s tailed off considerably this year, but the Orioles wouldn\'t be where they are without him.""He\'s got a chance to end up with 25-30 home runs and 80 RBIs. Who knows?"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""We know what he can do in bunches. I\'m real proud of the way he\'s continued to fight through it. A lot of people could have or would have given in, but he hasn\'t.""Delmon Young also homered for the Orioles, who built an 8-0 lead in the fifth inning against rookie Trevor May (0-4).It was the fifth loss in six games for the Twins. Their lone bright spot was a home run by Trevor Plouffe, the 10,000th in franchise history. The Twins contributed 7,214 of those homers after the Washington Senators hit 2,786 from 1901-1960.""It would have been better in a victory, obviously, but for me it\'s a cool thing,"" Plouffe said. ""I was at the right place at the right time. The one man largely responsible for most of those, Harmon Killebrew, he was a great man. He was great to me when he was around, and I think this is more like his thing than mine.""Gonzalez (7-7) allowed one run and four hits over seven innings, striking out six and walking one. With the exception of Plouffe, he permitted only one runner to get past first base.Making his fifth career start, May retired nine of the first 10 batters he faced before losing control in the fourth inning. The right-hander gave up a single and hit two batters with pitches before walking J.J. Hardy to force in a run. Davis then drove a 3-1 pitch into the right-field seats, the first homer allowed by May in his brief career.""There have been games where I\'ve had a rough couple of first at bats and I\'ve come up late and hit a home run or had a big hit,"" Davis said. ""I think that\'s the way you kind of have to approach it when you\'re not swinging the bat the way you want to all the time.""In the fifth, Young hit a two-run drive that glanced off the glove of left fielder Jordan Schafer into the glove of a fan in the front row of the seats.That ended May\'s night. He finished with eight strikeouts, one more than he had in his first five big league appearances combined.STREAKSTwins: The Twins ended their run of six straight games without a home run.Orioles: Pearce\'s career-high 11-game hitting streak ended. He grounded out in his only at-bat before leaving the game.UP NEXTTwins: Kyle Gibson (11-10) makes his 36th career start, first against the Orioles, on Saturday night. In his last outing, the right-hander yielded five runs in 4 2-3 innings against Detroit.Orioles: Chris Tillman (11-5) starts for Baltimore.

08/31/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: 3 Keys to the Postseason - Birds Watcher', 'Aug 27, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Steve Pearce (28) stretches for the force out of Tampa Bay Rays first baseman Vince Belnome (30) during the seventh inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Tampa Bay Rays defeated Baltimore Orioles 3-1. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAs the Orioles close-in on the postseason, standing eight games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees in the AL East, here are three keys to this team maximizing their potential and making a deep playoff run.Starting PitchingSince the All-Star Break, Orioles starting pitchers have posted a 3.28 ERA, good enough for sixth-best in the American League. Before the break, starters pitched to a 4.09 ERA, which was 11th in the league. The Orioles record before the All-Star Break was 52-42 (.553). After the break it was 26-14 (.650). Coincidence? Probably not.For the Orioles to have success in the playoffs, starters like Chris Tillman, Wei-Yin Chen, and Bud Norris must continue to give the Orioles a chance to win in every game. There are no Felix Hernandez or Clayton Kershaw-esque talents on this team, so winning a 1-0 game is unlikely. However, if Orioles pitchers can keep the team competitive, allowing the bats to make the difference and win the game with four or five runs, they would be doing an adequate job.Steve PearceSteve Pearce has become a key player for the Orioles as injuries and lack of production on the field have forced him into the lineup at various points this season. With the most recent injury to Manny Machado, Pearce and slugger Chris Davis have shouldered the biggest responsibility for picking up the slack the superstar talent has left. With Davis moving to third to fill-in for Machado, Pearce has played an impressive first base, picking balls out of the dirt and making more than just routine plays. Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s bat has also been one of the best on the team in the last 30 days, leading active Orioles in OPS (.928). An MRI revealed yesterday that an injury to Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s midsection is not serious and he is considered day-to-day after missing Saturday and Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s games.BullpenThe Baltimore bullpen has been one of the best pieces of the Oriole machine this year, despite some shaky ninth performances before Zach Britton was named the closer. Oriole relievers have pitched 427 innings before today\xe2\x80\x99s game, eighth most in the majors. Their ERA is 3.03, which is also eighth in the majors. However, some of the individual pieces are what makes this unit special. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day has the second-best ERA (0.91) of any MLB reliever who has pitched more than 20 innings. Zach Britton also maintains a ridiculously low ERA (1.92), has logged more than 30 saves, and induces ground balls at a 77% rate. With tools like O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Britton, as well as longman Brad Brach and big lefty Andrew Miller, there are several capable pitchers the Orioles can turn to to help win closely contested, high-intensity playoff games.

09/01/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Fond Farewell to July and August', 'Aug 31, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles catcher Caleb Joseph (36) hits a one-run rbi single in the sixth inning against the Minnesota Twins at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt is a beautiful thing to wake up on Labor Day, September 1st, and see the Baltimore Orioles leading the American League East by nine games! Even if nothing else goes well today, there is that!On Sunday afternoon, the Baltimore Orioles produced what is probably their second-best offensive-explosion game of the season, scoring 12 runs against the Minnesota Twins on a total of 18 base hits in a 12-8 victory. Back on April 8th against the Yankees, the Orioles tallied 14 runs on 20 hits. Just three weeks ago the O\xe2\x80\x99s had another 12-run game against the Cardinals, though with only 15 hits.All nine batters in the Baltimore Orioles lineup contributed at least one hit, with Caleb Joseph accounting for four hits personally. Nick Markakis and David Lough had three hits apiece.But the bulk of the Orioles scoring came on the home run, as it so often does. Nelson Cruz scored the first run of the game with a solo shot, and Ryan Flaherty followed with a three-run homer onto the flag court.\xc2\xa0 And J.J. Hardy appeared at the time to have broken open the game with a grand slam that was part of a seven-run sixth inning that opened to an11-2 lead.But it was simply a hitters\xe2\x80\x99 day, and the Orioles bullpen had an uncharacteristic meltdown. The Twins put together a total of six runs over the last three innings, even loading the bases and requiring the fire extinguishing talents of Zach Britton to get the final out\xe2\x80\x94one that represented the tying run.

Well, they can add more to that after Sunday, gaining six runs to only one from the Orioles.One would think that such a large lead would be safe in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s hands, even Ubaldo Jimenez. But coming on in relief and pitching just one-third of an inning, he set the forest ablaze with three walks and a hit. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve written before, he makes \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Chaos\xe2\x80\x9d Kevin Gregg look like a precision pitcher.Where can Ubaldo be safely used?\xc2\xa0 Probably only in a game where the O\xe2\x80\x99s have already been blown out, and that practically never happens. I\xe2\x80\x99d say to just shut it down, try to address it in the calm of the offseason, and then come back next year as a different person.The win leaves the Orioles with an incredible record of 79-56 and on pace to win 95 games. August was a great month for the O\xe2\x80\x99s as they finished it 19-9. During July they were just as good at 17-8 (June \xe2\x80\x93 16-12). In the month of August, the Orioles outscored their opponents 135 to 87. \xc2\xa0 This winning summer of baseball is what it felt like to be an O\xe2\x80\x99s fan in 1969-1971The win percentages of July and August are reminiscent of the pace of wins enjoyed by the great Baltimore Orioles teams of 1969-1971. This is what it felt like to be an O\xe2\x80\x99s fan at that time. But our more recent comparison and memory is to 2012. On the first of September just two years ago, the Orioles were 73-58. Of course, they would go 20-11 from that point to the end of the season.Also reminiscent of the 2012 Orioles is the way that new and unheralded players step in and get critical hits. The first person to come to mind from the past is Taylor Teagarden\xe2\x80\x94whose average was very anemic, but who got all of his RBIs when most needed.We are seeing that again in this season\xe2\x80\xa6 like Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s home run Sunday, the contributions of Jimmy Paredes over the past three games, David Lough getting a start and tallying three hits in the two hole, and the continued contributions of Caleb Joseph.One could almost bet that when Alejandro De Aza and Kelly Johnson step into their first Orioles game they are going to do something game-changing. It is just the way the Baltimore Orioles roll right now. Gotta like it!

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsSeptember 1st. In baseball, that date means roster expansions and call-ups from the Minor Leagues. For the first place Baltimore Orioles, the call-ups included two relievers from Triple-A Norfolk: Evan Meek and Joe Saunders.Meek has been up and down with the Orioles all season long. In 16 2/3 innings pitched with Baltimore, Meek had a 7.02 ERA with an 0-3 record to his name. Dispite a rough go in the Majors, he did pitch well with the Norfolk Tides in Triple-A ball. In 41 2/3 innings pitched with Norfolk, Meek had an impressive 1.94 ERA with 37 strikeouts and a 2-0 record. He also earned 16 saves in 16 save opportunities.Meek appears to have two different sides to him: A solid, reliable reliever in the Minors and an unpredictable, liability in the Majors. Hopefully as October rolls around, Baltimore fans will see the reliable Meek take over out of the bullpen.For Saunders, the switch from starter to reliever has been a great one. With the Tides, Saunders pitched 12 total innings after the Orioles signed him to a Minor League deal late in the season. In that short time, he established himself as a shutdown reliever. With a 1.50 ERA, Saunders has only given up two earned runs since being signed to Norfolk and has struck out eight batters as well.The last time Saunders put on an Orioles jersey, he was preparing to start for Baltimore in the first-ever American League Wild Card Playoff Game. He went on to win the game and extend the Orioles magical 2012 season.Hopefully, he and Meek will be able to help the Birds clinch their first American League East Division title since 1997.\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Wild victories still count', 'At various point in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game, you felt that the Baltimore Orioles had the game in hand and that the rest of the game was merely a formality. However it seemed like everytime the O\xe2\x80\x99s tried to get comfortable with the lead, Minnesota kept coming back. I suppose you could say that it was a rare off outing for perhaps the best bullpen in baseball; and if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have an off game, doing so in one where you have sizable leads is probably the time to do it.Through all of the craziness, Wei-Yin Chen still provided the Orioles with a decent start. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.2 IP, 8 H, 4 R, 0 BB, 7 K. To me, the zero walks and seven strikeouts indicates that he might have been getting a bit too much of the strikezone. However again, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have that happen you\xe2\x80\x99d like it to be in a game where you get 12 runs worth of support.Nelson Cruz smacked a solo homer, and Ryan Flaherty a three-run shot in the last of the third, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were off to a 4-0 lead. That lead was sawed in half an inning later when Trevor Plouffe knotched a two-run homer, which started a trend of Minnesota doing everything in their power to remain relevant in the game. And that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly to their credit; I would submit that Orioles fans would have often wished that the Birds would have put up a fight that strong back when they were playing out a string so to speak.The first time the O\xe2\x80\x99s thought they had busted the game wide open was in the sixth. Adam Jones smacked a two-run double, and J.J. Hardy hit a three-run homer to left field. Caleb Joseph would add an RBI-single, and with a seven-run inning and took an 11-2 lead. Game over for all intents and purposes\xe2\x80\xa6right? As Lee Corso says on ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s College Gameday,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6not so fast my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Schaefer (not \xe2\x80\x9cWilliam Donald,\xe2\x80\x9d for those keeping track at home) would smack an RBI-single in the seventh, and Santana would knotch a two-run home run. That only cut the lead to 11-5, however it also told the Orioles that they might not be done quite yet. For good measure, Jimmy Paredes would come through again in the last of the seventh with an RBI-single.Ubaldo Jimenez came in to mop of in the ninth inning, but somehow he thought that he was in the first inning of a game. After loading the bases he walked in a run, at which point he was lifted. Tommy Hunter then allowed a two-RBI single by Parmalee, prompting Buck Showalter to go to closer Zach Britton \xe2\x80\x93 game over with a double-play.Again, if the bullpen was going to have an off day you probably wanted to absorb the effects of that in a game that was all but over.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsObviously the part that sticks out to most people will be that Jimenez came in and struggled once again. As we move into September, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see too much of Jimenez. He might get into games in the manner he did yesterday (mop-up duty in a blowout), but with rosters expanding today the Orioles are going to have more pitchers at their disposal.Again, rosters expand to 40 players today. I would expect the O\xe2\x80\x99s to bring players in waves, with perhaps a couple of pitchers today for sure. Furthermore, I suspect that Buck Showalter might start managing games a bit differently. If a starter happens to struggle, I think the hook will come quicker given that there\xe2\x80\x99ll be more pitchers available to use and tiring out the pen isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be as big a deal.The series with Minnesota will conclude this afternoon, in a Labor Day matinee. Kevin Gausman will square off against Phil Hughes. Game time is set for just after 1:30 PM. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

It was a solid season for the 24 year old as he tossed 166.2 IP over 28 starts with a 3.67 ERA and 157 Ks between Bowie and Norfolk. Each of those represent career bests for him. He will almost certainly make his way to the majors at some point next season.    The offense popped 11 hits, but were only able to score via a David Freitas HR. Christian Walker went 2 for 4 with a double to cap off a season that could earn him the Brooks Robinson Minor League Player of the Year award.

Oh, and he did all of that as a 21 year old in the Eastern League where the average age 24.6. He may just find himself a recipient of the Jim Palmer Minor League Pitcher of the Year award. He will make his way to the Arizona Fall League in order to get some innings on his arm. Like Christian Walker, Mike Yastrzemski finished his season with a 2 for 4 day, notching a triple, an RBI, and 2 runs scored. His final season line stands at .288 / .346 / .490 with 34 doubles, 16 triples, and 14 HRs, while also chipping in 15 Outfield Assists. He will also certainly be in the running for the Brooks Robinson Award.    Potomac (Nats) 6 Frederick 1 Steven Brault was limited to just 3.1 IP thanks to an hour and forty-five minute rain delay. In those 3.1 innings though he allowed just 1 hit while K'ing 2 and inducing 5 ground outs to 0 fly outs. Spiffy. Jimmy Yacabonis and Lex Rutledge each allowed 3 ER over a combined 4.2 innings. Jason Esposito probably wishes the season would continue as he finished with a 2 for 4 day. From July 1 on he hit .327 / .353 / .505. He will look to further prove himself in the Arizona Fall League. Hickory (Rangers) 3 Delmarva 5 Janser Severino allowed 1 ER (3 runs total) over 6 IP. He allowed 5 hits, issued 2 walks, and K'd 3. Chance Sisco sat the final day of the season and earned South Atlantic League batting average title with a .340 AVG. Josh Hart went 2 for 4 with a double. Hudson Valley (TB) 6 Aberdeen 10 Fun game in a sweltering Ripken Stadium today that I attended. The O's first selection (3rd Round) in the 2014 draft, Brian Gonzalez, got the start. My impressions: Gonzalez is a beefy kid for an 18 year old, with a thick midsection, particularly his hips. He'll have to stay on top of his conditioning, but has a nice frame on which to add plenty of muscle. A late growth spurt adding another 2 inches of height wouldn't hurt either. He has an easy left-handed delivery from a 3/4 arm slot. His fastball sat in the 86-89 range, but he threw a couple in the mid-80's when he needed to get them over the plate. The FB doesn't have much natural movement and can be quite straight. The control was solid overall but came in went at times. He commanded the ball all around the zone, but did leave a few up in the zone. He showed a change up and curve, each of which sat in the 73-75 range. There were a couple of very quality offerings of each, with the change showing strong arm action and late drop, and the curve flashing some late, tight dip. Overall, he did not flash anything that could be called 'plus-plus', but everything he threw was solid-average. He should form a formidable southpaw duo with Stephen Tarpley in Delmarva to start next season.    As for the game, Gonzalez allowed a single, walk, and RBI single to open the game before getting a swinging K and a 4-6-3 DP to escape the inning. He rebounded nicely with a 1-2-3 2nd inning, getting 2 more Ks. The 3rd opened with a single followed by a swinging bunt single. But Gonzalez again escaped with a fly out and another GIDP which he started by taking a comebacker off the hip. Another 1-2-3 inning with 2 Ks in the 4th. In the 5th he issued a lead off walk followed by 2 singles before he was lifted. One of the inherited runners he left would be allowed to score, giving him a final line of 4+ IP, 6 H, 2 BBs, 3 ER, 5 Ks. Steve Clevenger got his hacks in today before returning to Baltimore tomorrow. 2 for 4 with a double and a HR, he just missed a second HR. Ball really doesn't carry well to RF there. Austin Anderson also smoked a ball to RCF that looked and sounded off the bat like a certain HR but died at the warning track. Randolph Gassaway impressed with a boom-stick 3 run HR to LF. He also smoked two other balls that were unfortunately outs hit directly at fielders. Jay Gonzalez went 3 for 4 with all three hits going the other way into LF. Defensively, Hector Veloz at 3B is a trip. Just plop him down over at 1B and hope for the best. Jonah Heim is another in a line of tall O's catchers. He cuts a lean figure and frames the ball nicely, giving the ump a clean view of every pitch.

Fortunately, his peripherals are still good, with nine strikeouts versus three walks in that span. FIP may suggest that Norris isn't pitching as well this year as he did last season, but other metrics like xFIP (4.22 in 2013, 4.13 this year) and SIERA (4.19 to 4.01) suggest slight improvement. Latos missed nearly half of the season recovering from knee surgery in February. He's been quite good since returning, with a very good ERA and solid peripherals, even if he's perhaps lucking out on home runs (6.6% HR/FB). Latos throws lots of fastballs, roughly two-thirds of the time to all batters. Fellow righties get about twice as many four-seamers as sinkers, while lefties see the ratio nearly reversed. Lefties hardly see any offspeed pitches until he's ready to finish them off with his splitter or, a bit less often, his slider. Righties also face the splitter as an out pitch, but they have to deal with sliders in all counts as well. He also has a curveball, which he uses more to mix things up than to finish off batters. Maybe hot: Brandon Phillips (.945 OPS, 17 PA) Likely not: Skip Schumaker (.376 OPS, 25 PA) Wednesday, September 3, 7:05 ET: Miguel Gonzalez vs. Dylan Axelrod      Gonzalez Axelrod   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 171.1 127.0 128.1 11.0   ERA 3.78 3.61 5.68 1.64   FIP 4.45 5.16 5.44 3.85   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .243/.300/.413 .263/.329/.454 .318/.372/.519 .220/.289/.439         Gonzalez has given the O's three straight better-than-minimum quality starts, totaling 19.1 IP, four runs, thirteen strikeouts, and three walks over that span. His home run rate continues to frighten, unfortunately, as he also surrendered three of them in that time, leaving his HR/9 at 1.56 and his HR/FB% at 13.0. There's likely some poor luck involved - unlike FIP, xFIP and SIERA see his performance this year as pretty comparable to his career numbers - but Gonzalez is what he is: homer-prone, yet with a peripheral-defying ERA.    Axelrod spent most of the year in AAA, both before and after being traded by the White Sox. He was called back up to the majors on August 16, so he's only made a couple of starts this year. In that time, the righty has thrown 53% fastballs to all hitters. Against right-handed batters, nearly all of those fastballs are four-seamers, making Axelrod essentially a fastball-slider guy with the rare curve, change, or sinker tossed in for good measure. Versus lefties, his approach is quite different, as he uses sinkers slightly more often than four-seamers. The slider is his preferred out pitch, and he'll throw occasional changeups to keep hitters honest.

He hasn't given up more than three earned runs since June 5, nor more than two runs at all since July 29. Leake hasn't given up a run in his last two starts (13.2 IP), but had a pair of rough outings before then (9 ER, 12 IP). Looking at his peripherals, he's having the best season of his career: he's bumped up his strikeout rate a touch, kept his walk rate below the league average, and pushed his groundball rate over 50%. Leake likes to throw fastballs; roughly 70% of his pitches are heaters. Fellow righties get about a 3:1 ratio of sinkers to cutters, while for lefties, that ratio is more like 3:2. Leake uses his cutter and slider to finish batters off, using an even mix against righties but more cutters versus lefties. All batters will get occasional show-me curveballs, and lefties will also see some changeups on the first pitch or when Leake's behind in the count.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsNow that September has arrived and the Baltimore Orioles are able to expand their roster with varied call-ups and additions, how are these modifications going to help the team finish the season and head into the playoffs?I have always had the view that if the Orioles could ever get to September with any sort of lead at all in the AL East, that Dan Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s piles and piles of \xe2\x80\x9cdepth\xe2\x80\x9d additions and Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s managerial expertise would render any pursuing team hopelessly incapable of catching up. I would have never imagined that a scenario could develop where that lead was in the area of eight or nine games!Of course, the issue is not simply defeating the New York Yankees and winning the AL East title. It is also about preparing for the playoffs. There is also the issue of pursuing the very best record in all of the American League and thus gaining home field advantage. There is more to an expanded roster than just beating the YankeesSo before looking at a list of the roster modifications, how will these additional players be used profitably by the Baltimore Orioles in the next 25+ games?More Matchup Options \xe2\x80\x93 It goes without saying that the goal is to win as many games as possible. But matching up has been a problem for the Orioles for much of the season. Often they have carried 12 pitchers, leaving only three position players for pinch-hitting or defense (after discounting keeping a spare catcher in the hole). There has been a lack of left-handed hitting options, and that can be addressed now. Some speed can be added to the lineup at critical times. And multiple defensive substitutions can be made late in games.Insurance Policy \xe2\x80\x93 If the 2014 MLB baseball season will be remembered for anything, it will likely be as the year of the injury. So many teams have suffered losses, and for the Orioles it has been Matt Wieters and Manny Machado \xe2\x80\xa6 though the DL has seen more names than these. In the last couple days we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Steve Pearce with an abdominal strain, J.J. Hardy with back spasms, and something that had Andrew Miller limping off the field. All it takes is one Sabbathia-like \xe2\x80\x9cerrant\xe2\x80\x9d pitch to break a bone, and everything is changed. Having a full stable of options for not only the final stretch, but for the playoffs as well, is a wise insurance policy investment.Resting Regulars \xe2\x80\x93 In spite of all the denials to the contrary made in 2013 that players were not wearing down in the final month, well, clearly they were, and it was costly. The Orioles need to prevent such a repeat this year. Again, with the issue of a short bench, it is difficult to give a day off to regulars like Adam Jones or Nick Markakis. The bullpen is certainly less taxed than in the previous two years, but having some extra arms can prevent the pen from getting worn down in extended games or in contests with wide scoring margins \xe2\x80\x93 either far ahead or far behind.Playoff Roster \xe2\x80\x93 Beyond the next month, this thoughtful personnel expansion gives the O\xe2\x80\x99s more options to take the very best 25-man roster into the postseason.Roster AdditionsJimmy Paredes \xe2\x80\x93 Having already played four games for the Orioles, he is 6-for-15 with two doubles and a homer. He hit .289 in AAA this year in 97 games, stealing 21 bases. Paredes is an athlete, not just a baseball player.Kelly Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 This is the addition that makes the least sense to me, as Johnson is only hitting .212 this year. I wonder how many players, if any, have at some point been on all five of the AL East teams. These experiences, along with his veteran presence, may account for the move in intangible ways not immediately obvious.Alejandro De Aza \xe2\x80\x93 Though some of his numbers are down from his .267 career average, he is a left-handed bat with speed. And he did hit 17 home runs a year ago. Perhaps he can find the porch in right field at Camden Yards. It was said that he was secured because of good performance against some upcoming foes. This is especially true against the Yankees where he has a .329 average in 80 plate appearances.Quintin Berry \xe2\x80\x93 This high school friend of Adam Jones certainly had a good season of baseball and was only stuck at AAA because of the outfield depth on the Baltimore Orioles. How many teams can bring in a guy in September for a pennant run who has playoff and World Series experience \xe2\x80\x93 who has never been thrown out stealing a base in the big leagues? For AAA Norfolk this year, Berry hit .285 with 25 stolen bases.

At AAA he had a 1.94 ERA over 39 innings. Meek can eat up some innings for the O\xe2\x80\x99s in September.Ryan Webb \xe2\x80\x93 Over the first of two years with the Orioles, Webb had a mixed bag of results before being sent to AAA. It is not certain if his shoulder will guarantee a return.Joe Saunders \xe2\x80\x93 The Orioles were among the teams that pounded the daylights out of Saunders over eight games with Texas. But in 10 games at Norfolk, pitching in relief, he has a 1.50 ERA. As a veteran pitcher, one can imagine how this could work out and prove to be another Dan Duquette miracle move. Not sure I\xe2\x80\x99d bet on it, but it is imaginable.Steve Clevenger \xe2\x80\x93 This adds a third catcher and another left-handed hitter.Taxi Squad \xe2\x80\x93 The Baltimore Orioles will have an additional group of players in reserve and working out in Sarasota as a surplus insurance policy. Included in this group are Dariel Alvarez, Buck Britton, Oliver Drake, Eddie Gamboa, Preston Guilmet, Brock Huntzinger, Chris Jones, Michael Ohlman, Henry Urrutia, Christian Walker, Brian Ward, Tyler Wilson and Mike Wright.Considering all of the names mentioned here, the Orioles will have 16 pitchers, 3 catchers, 6 infielders and 8 outfielders\xe2\x80\xa6 for a total of 33 players, with 13 more in Florida. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Why Do The Baltimore Orioles Start Delmon Young?', 'This picture tells you everything you need to know about Young\xe2\x80\x99s fielding. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAs the Baltimore Orioles near the playoffs, I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent the past few weeks looking at some trends of theirs. Two weeks ago, I examined Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s recent hot stretch, which I concluded was legitimate; last week, I examined Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s recent cold stretch, which I concluded was legitimate as well. Today, though, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to scrutinize a player, per se, so much as Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s implementation of him.When the Orioles signed Delmon Young to a minor league deal in January, it could have been a decent move. He has strengths, and while his weaknesses certainly outnumber them, he can assist a team. Sadly, though, the Birds have botched their usage of this man, and it may come back to bite them in the future.First, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about defense. Some players, such as David Lough and (to a lesser extent) the newly-acquired Alejandro De Aza, excel in the field; they consistently make good plays, and their statistics reflect that. Other players \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0Steve Pearce\xc2\xa0and (also to a lesser extent) Cruz, to name a few\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 can\xe2\x80\x99t attain that level of performance; nonetheless, they know their limits, play the ball well, and post respectable, if subpar, numbers. And then there are the players who, for lack of a better way of phrasing it, suck. Their defense nauseates fans and teammates alike, and they have long passed the age at which they could hope to improve.\xc2\xa0If a team owned the rights to a player from the latter group, they surely wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allot him regular playing time\xe2\x80\xa6right? One would certainly think so.Yesterday, the Orioles faced the Minnesota Twins, in the final game of a four-game series. Pearce didn\xe2\x80\x99t play (an abdomen injury still hampers him), so the team needed someone to man left field. Cruz \xe2\x80\x94 who has played there sparingly this season, with decent results \xe2\x80\x94 received a justifiable defensive break, so they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pick him. But they still had two good options in Lough and De Aza. Instead of selecting either of them, though, the club opted for Young. They soon regretted it.In the sixth inning, Kevin Gausman had runners on second and third, with one out. Dominant hitter-turned-middling schlub Joe Mauer hit a line drive to deep left. Young misjudged it, and let it go over his head; then, he misjudged it again, and allowed it to bounce away. By the time he recovered and threw the ball to the infield, Mauer had slid safely into third base.\xc2\xa0He knocked in two runs on his 22nd career triple, in a game with a two-run margin of victory.Would Lough or De Aza have made the play? Maybe, maybe not. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter, since anecdotal evidence can mislead. Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at something more empirical: defensive statistics. While they differ from site to site, they tend to agree on most players, and Young is no exception. For his career, he has cost his various teams:65.1 runs, according to UZR.48 runs, according to DRS.44.4 runs, according to FRAA.However you slice it, Young has always been a liability in the field. How much of a liability, you ask?\xc2\xa0FanGraphs\xe2\x80\x99s positional adjustments dock corner outfielders 7.5 runs per 600 plate appearances, and designated hitters 17.5 runs per 600 plate appearances (about a season\xe2\x80\x99s worth). This means that if a corner outfielder is 10 or more runs below average per season, he would hurt his team less by DHing. For his career, Young is 12.6 runs below average per season by UZR, and 12 by DRS (FRAA doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do a per-season number). So, yeah.Young provides no value with the glove, and with his 29th birthday looming, he\xe2\x80\x99ll only decline in that regard going forward. So why would Baltimore put his immobile body in left? It probably has something to do with his offense. Despite an 0-for-4 in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s outing, he has still had a seemingly resurgent season at the plate, with a .294/.335/.445 line that translates to a .345 wOBA and 119 wRC+. This hitter certainly appears to be superior to Lough or De Aza (who have wRC+s of 75 and 83, respectively, in 2014), but appearances can mislead.First of all, Young has most likely hit better because of luck. His strikeout and walk rates (4.5% and 19.6%, respectively) are just as bad as they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been (4.2% and 18.0%, respectively, for his career), and OPACY\xe2\x80\x99s dimensions account for, and neutralize, his moderate uptick in power (.152 ISO, compared to .142 for all years). BABIP has driven his breakout, as he\xe2\x80\x99s put up a .344 mark\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 significantly higher than his career level of .323. However, the absence of a real increase in line drive rate, the presence of more infield fly balls, and the small sample size (224) of it all, give the impression of an anomaly.More important than that, though, is Young\xe2\x80\x99s platoon split. In 2014, he has a 133 wRC+ against right-handed pitchers, and a 92 wRC+ against left-handed pitchers. This flips the script from his overall career, in which he owns a 114 wRC+ off lefties to go along with a 91 wRC+ against righties. As Mitchel Lichtman will tell you, platoon split reversals don\xe2\x80\x99t just happen\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s almost certainly just a fluke, and you should trust the hitter\xe2\x80\x99s past numbers. In Young\xe2\x80\x99s case, this means\xc2\xa0you only play him against left-handers.\xc2\xa0With his aforementioned defense, he only helps your team when he\xe2\x80\x99s at the plate, and only then when he hits southpaws.And yet, despite all of this, Young found himself in the lineup \xe2\x80\x94 and hitting second!!! \xe2\x80\x94 on Sunday, against Phil Hughes. In case you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, Hughes throws with his right hand. For the record, De Aza\xe2\x80\x99s career wRC+ against lefties sits at a comparatively-impressive 101; Lough\xe2\x80\x99s, at an also comparatively-impressive 90. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t Buck Showalter start one of them? God only knows.But hey, these could be flukes, right? Perhaps the Orioles normally only let Young hit for the pitcher, and will limit his exposure to righties when they do so. Would that this were the case. Of his 224 trips to the dish thus far, 65 have come as an outfielder; even in his minuscule 131.1 innings of work there, he has been worth -1.4 UZR\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s -20 for a full season! Worse, 148 of his PAs have come against lefties; although he has produced well in those, I discussed above why that output probably won\xe2\x80\x99t continue. The Orioles could have had an asset, but they haven\xe2\x80\x99t followed the formula for one.With Lough on the roster, Baltimore simply has no use for Young. They even dealt for De Aza, presumably as a backup option, should one of their other players get hurt. Pearce has done just that, but they still trot Young out there, to botch fly balls and flounder against opposite-handed pitching. Come October, this could cost them a game, which could cost them the season. This certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bode well for the future.All statistics courtesy of Baseball-Reference.

Photo: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt was one of the most unconventional ways the Baltimore Orioles have ever begun or ended a game, but it got the job done.

That is, if you like thinking about magic numbers this early.Tonight, the Orioles got enough runs quickly and were able to hold on. But even in the process of going 23 games over .500 and having the largest lead of any division leader in baseball, concerns have cropped up. Even in the process of trading for Alejandro De Aza, and adding more speed to the postseason roster in the person of Quintin Berry and Jimmy Paredes, third base has already started to revert to the pre-Manny days of sticking out like a sore thumb. The left field situation is similar.Paredes, even though his bat provided a huge boost in Saturday night\xe2\x80\x99s win, has rough edges in his defensive game. Kelly Johnson, who also arrived in the De Aza trade,\xc2\xa0asked to play third\xc2\xa0late in tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game, also let one get by. The furthest thing from anybody\xe2\x80\x99s mind was that\xc2\xa0any backup third baseman would be in Machado\xe2\x80\x99s league defensively. The deals made at the trade deadline and the September call-ups have added depth at all the infield positions.But it is a defensive dropoff, and that results in an opposing hit that should have been an out, a baserunner who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been there, a runner on second or third who should have been held at first, more pitches needed to get out of an inning, an early exit for the starter, and a fried bullpen. It\xe2\x80\x99s the reason Andrew Miller was acquired\xc2\xa0for late-inning relief\xc2\xa0help.Little things add up, and it could cost a game here or thereBut it\xe2\x80\x99s living the old way. It led indirectly to Jay Bruce\xe2\x80\x98s grand slam off Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day in the 8th inning last night, even though Zach Britton held the fort after that.Little things add up, and that has the potential to cost a game here or there, show up in the won-lost record, and\xc2\xa0translate into losing home field to the L.A. Angels \xe2\x80\x94 or just losing the playoffs and seeing the dream season end.Until then, don\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s stupid to watch the dream keep unfolding. I\xe2\x80\x99m just pointing to warning signs. The Orioles are 80-57, the only team other than the Angels with 80 or more victories. There are 25 games left, and going only 15-10 gets them to 95. It continues to astonish me the Orioles have achieved what\xc2\xa0they have without Wieters, without Machado for chunks of the year, including the rest of it, and with Chris Davis hitting well under .200 since late July.When Steve Pearce comes back from his strained\xc2\xa0abdominal muscle, he goes back to first base, returning Davis to third, which had\xc2\xa0recently started to look like an acceptable arrangement.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsA second inning solo home run by Jonathan Schoop with the Baltimore Orioles leading 4-0 proved to be the winning run in what was a 5-4 victory for the O\xe2\x80\x99s over the Cincinnati Reds.But Schoop not only damaged the Reds with his bat, he made three terrific defensive plays to keep Cincinnati from gaining additional scores, particularly on the final play of the game.After a two-hour rain delay, the Baltimore Orioles came to bat in the bottom of the first inning and did something we seldom see from this team: they strung together a series of five singles to score four runs.After Nick Markakis AGAIN led off a game with a single, the new Oriole in the lineup\xe2\x80\x94Alejandro De Aza\xe2\x80\x94would get an infield hit to put the first two runners on base. They were followed by RBI singles by Nelson Cruz, Chris Davis, and Caleb Joseph. Jimmy Paredes also knocked in a run on a groundout in that sequence.If I had told you even a month ago that De Aza would be in left field and Paredes at third base for the Orioles in September, would you have believed it? But again, even as predicted yesterday in this blog, a Dan Duquette acquisition would come through in his first game with critical hits. De Aza would get a second hit in the fifth inning, but would be caught attempting to steal third base.Bud Norris and the Orioles seemed fully in control of this game. Norris had excellent stuff with all his pitches and gave up zero runs in six innings. But it again, as in recent days, was the bullpen who demonstrated some signs of rough edges. The incredible and unhittable Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day allowed the bases loaded in the top of the eighth inning on a walk, throwing error on Paredes, and HBP. This brought Jay Bruce to the plate and a grand slam that made the pending laugher into a one-run game.In giving up four runs (three earned) in two-thirds of an inning, O\xe2\x80\x99Day saw his ERA go from 0.91 to 1.34. This is why a somewhat high ERA of a reliever doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always tell everything. One or two bad days can blow it up in a hurry\xe2\x80\xa6 not that 1.34 is blown up.But the excitement wasn\xe2\x80\x99t over. Zach Britton got the first out, but then gave up a double to Ramon Santiago. And an infield chopper by Billy Hamilton put runners on the corner. Todd Frazier then hit a hard ground ball to Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s glove-side, where he tagged Hamilton and threw to first for the double play \xe2\x80\xa6 game over. Earlier, Schoop had made a diving stop and throw to first to rob Frazier of a single; and he also made a great running catch behind first base. Schoop really was the difference-maker on this evening.If I were a Cincinnati Reds writer rather than an Orioles blogger and editor, I would be coming out of my skin about the stupid base-running play in the ninth inning by Billy Hamilton. To simply run into the second baseman fielding the ball is to literally run into a double play. Yes, he attempted to avoid the tag \xe2\x80\x93 unsuccessfully \xe2\x80\x93 which is the way it always is if the fielder is in the direct line of the basepath. Here is the play\xe2\x80\xa6The correct play for the baserunner at that point is to stop dead in his tracks. This makes the second baseman either come and tag him, and thus fail to get the runner at first; or if the infielder throws to first, the runner can likely gain second base before the throw and tag.On this evening, it disallowed the tying run to score and gave the win to the Orioles. Thank you Mr. Hamilton, though a professional player should know the game better than that; but he is not the first I have seen make this blunder.The victory gives the Orioles a 9.5-game advantage over the Yankees who lost to the Red Sox 9-4 on Tuesday night.

09/04/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: How will playoff rotation look?', 'Photo: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWith their impressive win last night the Orioles move to 81-57 and 9.5 games up on the second-place New York Yankees in the American League East. Now just two games behind the Angels with just 24 games remaining, the Orioles primary focus for the rest of the regular season will be finishing with the best record in the American League and earning home field advantage through the ALCS. However, Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter will have some interesting roster decisions to make come October, particularly in the starting rotation. Although they would never say it, the rest of September will partially be used to help shape how the starting rotation will be lined up going into the playoffs. How effective or ineffective each starter is in their remaining 3 or 4 starts could determine their role in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first playoff series. There is no doubt any post season rotation will include Chris Tillman, Miguel Gonzalez and Wei-Yin Chen. The only question will be in which order. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to consider when laying out the rotation for the post season. The first could just come down to who is on normal rest. Also, who the Orioles play and whether or not they have home field advantage. Even the time of the game could factor into the decision.However, there is something special about pitching the first game of the post season, and its obvious Buck will want to go with his hottest hand. With his performance last night, Miguel Gonzalez is doing his part to get the nod. Gonzalez may have pitched the best game of his career going all nine innings and allowing only five base runners for his first career shutout. However, it was no fluke. Since June he has allowed more than 3 runs only once, and has failed to go at least 6 innings only once. Chris Tillman was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 opening day starter, and would be the obvious choice to start game one in any playoff series. He has also had an impressive recent stretch. Tillman hasn\xe2\x80\x99t given up more than three runs since June 5, that\xe2\x80\x99s a 16 game span. He also gave up a ridiculous 6 runs in 6 starts in August. While Tillman and Gonzalez have been impressive of late, it\xe2\x80\x99s Wei-Yin Chen that has been the most reliable pitcher all season. He has failed to go at least 5 innings only twice all season, and currently leads the team with 14 wins. He has also only walked 28 in his 26 starts this season. Back of the rotation starters Kevin Gausman and Bud Norris could have their roles dependent on the playoff schedule, and what the series score is heading into the fourth and fifth game. If the Orioles are down going into the fourth game, they may choose to stick to a three-man rotation and use Norris and Gausman out of the bullpen. The Orioles could use a three-man rotation throughout the playoffs. However, over their careers both Gonzalez and Chen have seemed to benefit from more extra rest in between starts. So off days and travel schedule could dictate how often Buck wants to use them. It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to note that all five starters could be over or near their career highs in innings pitched going into October.There are a lot of factors that go into the how to set up a playoff starting rotation, and the Orioles will have some tough decisions to make. However, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t a lot or any managers in baseball that are as prepared as Buck Showalter, and there is no doubt he will have his players in the best position to win.  ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Preview: Orioles Vs. Reds \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' By NOEY KUPCHAN STATS Writer (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 While Chris Tillman has more than held his own all year, he\xe2\x80\x99s proven unbeatable over the last six-plus weeks. After getting shut out for the 13th time, the Cincinnati Reds can\xe2\x80\x99t be happy to hear that. Tillman again tries to win a fifth consecutive decision as the surging Baltimore Orioles go for a three-game sweep against the visiting Reds on Thursday night. Baltimore (81-57) has won each of Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s last seven starts, during which he\xe2\x80\x99s gone 4-0 with a 1.77 ERA. The right-hander, who\xe2\x80\x99s allowed three earned runs or fewer in 16 consecutive outings, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost since a 3-0 defeat to the New York Yankees on July 12. Tillman (11-5, 3.36 ERA) allowed six hits and three walks Saturday but managed to limit the damage, yielding one run over five innings and not registering a decision in a 3-2 victory over Minnesota. Tillman is 4-5 despite a 2.50 ERA at home, where he\xe2\x80\x99s received one or zero runs of support in 10 of his 15 appearances. Tillman will try to keep the Reds quiet after Miguel Gonzalez threw a four-hitter for his first career complete game in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 6-0 victory. Jonathan Schoop went 2 for 3 with a homer and three RBIs while Chris Davis and David Lough also went deep. While Davis is still hitting .194, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone 8 for 30 with four homers and 11 RBIs in helping Baltimore win eight of 10. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been in the middle of a lot of things lately,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Buck Showalter told MLB\xe2\x80\x99s official website. The AL East-leading Orioles are a league-best 23-7 at home since June 30. They have now won eight consecutive home series for the first time since April 20-June 6, 1984. The Reds (66-73), meanwhile, have hit .159 in losing four of five on their six-game trip. They have dropped 21 of their last 27 away from home for baseball\xe2\x80\x99s second-worst record since June 30. Dylan Axelrod served up all three homers Wednesday as the Orioles increased their total to 182 \xe2\x80\x93 by far the most in the majors. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything offensively at all to give (Axelrod) any support. That\xe2\x80\x99s been an underlying theme to our second half,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Bryan Price said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not questioning effort. I do think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten to this point now where we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some guys up here that we need to take a look at. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not doing anything at all offensively, and it makes it a lot easier to start to see what we have in our system, see what we have moving forward.\xe2\x80\x9d Brandon Phillips and Kristopher Negron are a combined 0 for 32 during the trek. Ryan Ludwick has also struggled of late, going 2 for his last 23. Jay Bruce, who hit a grand slam in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s 5-4 defeat, is batting .188 with just those four RBIs over his last 14 games. The Reds now turn to Mike Leake (10-11, 3.33), who carries a 13 2-3 scoreless innings streak into Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s matchup. The right-hander allowed six hits without walking a batter over seven innings but didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive a decision in Friday\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 loss at Pittsburgh.

That sounds like a rather pompous statement and headline, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Well, it is. With the best record in baseball since the beginning of July, an Orioles writer can pen something like that.The O\xe2\x80\x99s players got to their hotel rooms at 4:00 in the morning, and they played like a team that was going a bit on reduced sleep. Though honestly, this Orioles squad has overcome that obstacle in the past with some great performances (yet sometimes paying for it the second day after travel).In any event, this just never had the look of a game that the Orioles were going to win.

Mariners/Tigers (WC #2). Aside from the Mariners falling 1/2 game back of the Tigers, that seeding has stayed the same. There was some movement within the standings, though, as both the Orioles and Angels pulled away from the second-place team in their respective division and the A's had a terrible week that sent them tumbling further from the Angels in the west and cutting their wild card lead by three games. Here are the updated standings:       Division Leaders Record Games + Change from 8/29   E - Orioles 82-57 9.5 +2.5   C - Royals 77-61 1 -0.5   W - Angels 84-55 5 +3   Wild Card Race Record Games +/- Change from 8/29   Athletics 79-60 +2.5 -3   Tigers 77-63 -- --   Mariners 76-63 -0.5 -0.5   Yankees 72-66 -4 -1   Blue Jays 72-67 -5 +1   Indians 71-67 -5 -1    The Yankees, Blue Jays, and Indians are pretty much out of it, though it's certainly not unprecedented for a team to come back from a large deficit in September (just ask the 2011 Red Sox). The Indians had a big chance to make their move last week, but couldn't get the job done. They came within three outs of a three-game sweep of the Royals before the last game was suspended due to rain, then they lost three of four to the Tigers. The Blue Jays, on the other hand, have won five games in a row in an attempt to creep back into our consciousness. But really, the race for the wild card is between the Athletics, Mariners, and Tigers. Here is what they have going on this weekend:    Athletics vs Astros The A's are reeling. They were swept in a four-game series by the Angels last weekend, and spent this week losing two out of three to the Mariners. Their once seemingly ironclad postseason spot is in danger. They play a weekend series against the Astros, which might seem like sweet respite. But the Astros just took three of four from the Angels so anything could happen.    I'm rooting for the Astros in this one. I think it would be interesting for the A's to continue to fall, plus I always root for bad teams. It's in my blood. Angels @ Twins The Angels are just two games ahead of the Orioles for the best record in baseball. Previously I was against the Orioles getting the #1 seed because I thought they'd have a better chance against the Royals than the winner of an A's/Mariners wild card game. My feelings have changed, though. I want the best record in baseball. The Twins are bad, though, so it's unlikely the O's will gain any ground over the weekend.    Mariners @ Rangers Man, the AL West is really slumming it this weekend. The Rangers are the only team who have been officially eliminated from all postseason play. I'm still rooting for the Mariners to make the postseason over the Tigers, and they shouldn't have too tough of a time getting wins this weekend. Tigers vs. Giants Speaking of the Tigers, they'll have a tougher task this weekend. The Giants are the current first wild card team in the NL league, and are just two games behind the Dodgers in the NL West. I'll be rooting for the Giants, but if you have an NL rooting interest I guess you might not be. Yankees vs Royals The Royals go to New York fighting for their playoff lives. They've been clinging to first place for awhile now, and it would be nice for them to get some breathing room ahead of the Tigers. I think I speak for us all when I say go Royals!

That's not actually true, but it also feels like it's true, which makes it true even when it's not true. Let's move on before a philosophy class breaks out. The O's have seen Cobb twice this year, touching him up for five runs in only nine innings pitched. Both of those games were in Baltimore, so facing Cobb in the Trop will be a new thing for both sides, at least for this year.

He has faced this Rays team four times this season, allowing 11 runs over 21 innings. That's not so good. The last time he faced them in the Trop, he gave up three home runs. The good news is that Chen has pitched much better in the second half, so if that continues, maybe the earlier trend has changed to something new. Home runs are often the problem for Chen. He's allowed 22 this season. At least he doesn't walk many batters, so they aren't getting free passes before getting home runs. But he does give up a lot of hits; the .270 batting average against is high. The magic that the Orioles defense works with other pitchers does not seem to extend to Chen.

Chen\xe2\x80\x99s issue continues to be his pitch count however, as he was lifted after throwing 107 pitches over six innings. However that\xe2\x80\x99s also due in part to the opponent; that\xe2\x80\x99s just what Tampa does.This game was scoreless going to the last of the eighth inning, as Ryan Webb came on in relief for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. He allowed two runners to reach on base hits before Evan Meek was summoned from the bullpen in relief of Webb. Meek would load the bases with a walk, and then allow an RBI-single to Yuniel Escobar to give Tampa a 1-0 lead. Hanigan would come up later in the inning with the bags still juiced, and deliver a two-RBI-single. Tampa closer Jake McGee took to the hill in the ninth and sent the Birds down 1-2-3, snapping the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 three-game winning streak.Obviously you can\xe2\x80\x99t win them all, and nobody\xe2\x80\x99s expecting that. But it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to have a shot when you don\xe2\x80\x99t score any runs. But again, good pitching will shut down good hitting most of the time. And keep in mind that the same is true on the flip side of the coin. Oriole pitching was great last night as well. That 3-0 score is not in any way indicative of how this game unfolded. Even after the O\xe2\x80\x99s surrendered the runs, Joe Saunders was able to come in and close Tampa down in the inning to send the game to the ninth to give the O\xe2\x80\x99s one last shot at tying the game.With all of this said, there was one thing I found very interesting in this game. Buck Showalter indicated that there were a few relieversCourtesy of Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sportsfrom which he wanted to stay away last night. The O\xe2\x80\x99s of course had to use several relievers on Thursday against Cincinnati (although the bullpen wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used on Wednesday night at all). You notice that Showalter went to the likes of Webb, Meek, and Saunders in the eighth inning last night as opposed to some of the usual suspects \xe2\x80\x93 O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Hunter, and Miller.Was Showalter punting the game in a sense? Not in the least so far as I know. However the fact that the Baltimore Orioles have such a wide lead in the AL East combined with the fact that they now have quite a few more relievers on the expanded roster gives the Birds a bit more flexibility. This is not to say that there was no faith in the likes of Webb and company, however it prevents the O\xe2\x80\x99s from using their key relievers in a game that while important was far from a must-win. I suspect that going into this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game most of the bullpen would be available, so if in fact that\xe2\x80\x99s the case Showalter may well have at the very least been willing to lose one minor battle to win the war.  There will be fans who don\xe2\x80\x99t like that concept in the least, and I can understand that. However it\xe2\x80\x99s really no different than running out of pinch hitters in a National League game and having to send a reliever up to bat. At the end of the day assuming that the Orioles win the AL East is it really going to matter who won this specific game? (Furthermore, odds are that O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Hunter, and Miller would be on the post-season roster while Webb and Meek might not be. It pays to keep guys as fresh as possible.)The series continues this afternoon in a game that\xe2\x80\x99ll begin just after 1 PM \xe2\x80\x93 and nationally televised by FOX at that.

09/08/2014,"[('Orioles release 2015 schedule - Camden Chat', "" One good thing about sitting in first place in the division with a 9.5 game lead in September is that there is not a need to look to next year. We can do it because we want to, because it's a Monday afternoon and we're bored, not because there's nothing left to look forward to in the current season. The 2015 schedule was released on Monday afternoon - so, the Orioles are in first place right now and there's a cure for boredom. That's a win on both ends.    As far as the 2015 season itself, for the Orioles, it will span from Opening Day on April 6 (a Monday) through the final regular season game on October 4, which is a Sunday. After opening the season at home this year, they will instead open on the road next season, getting the campaign underway with three games against the Trop. They will, however, close out the season with a seven-game homestand, with the final three games coming against the Yankees. The home opener will take place on Friday, April 10, against the Blue Jays. Once again, the O's will find themselves playing in Boston for the Patriots Day game on April 20. For interleague opponents next year, the Orioles will face the National League East. That means that their customary series against the Nationals will be back to three games in each city. The O's will host the Nats from July 10-12 and head to the Washington mallpark from September 21-23, a very late-season interleague matchup that could be crucial if both teams perform the way they have this year. The July Nats series is the last series before the All-Star Break.    They'll play the Mets and Phillies for two games in each team's park and two games at home. The Phillies games are consecutive (June 15-16 in Baltimore, June 17-18 in Philadelphia) while the Mets games are split apart. They play the Mets on May 5-6, which will be followed by a four-game series against the Yankees in New York. The Mets come to Baltimore on August 18-19.    The O's will also host the Braves July 27-29 and head to Miami from May 22-24 to wrap up their interleague play for the season. Unless they make the World Series, of course. Once again, the Orioles will come out of the All-Star Break with a long road trip, heading to Detroit, New York, and then Tampa Bay from July 17-26. Their annual West Coast expedition will run from August 3-12, and they don't have to make any further trips that far for the remainder of the year.    The longest road trip of the season will run ten games from September 17-27, spanning a series against the Rays, Nats, and Red Sox. May will be the most active month at Camden Yards, with 18 of the 27 games that month coming at home. By contrast, it will be the emptiest in July, when 17 of 27 games are on the road. They'll be at home more in the first half (48 games) than in the second half (33 games). If the O's can win on the road next year like this year's team, there won't be much to worry about there, although having fewer late-summer game dates is unfortunate if O's fans won't get as many chances to bask in a winning team. You can check out the full schedule for yourself\xc2\xa0here.    It's hard to say whether this schedule counts as easy or hard because nobody knows how all of the teams they'll face will be next year. We don't know who will be on any of those teams yet, or who will be on the Orioles. No one would have expected the defending champion Red Sox to be a weak team this year, but here we are. And the Orioles are plenty capable of beating any good team or getting swept by any bad team. That's baseball.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Prospect season in review: Dylan Bundy - Camden Chat', "" Dylan Bundy's story so far is well-known to many Orioles fans, but let's do a quick rehash to bring everyone up to speed. Considered the best pitcher in the 2011 amateur draft, the Orioles selected Bundy in the first round, fourth overall. He wowed scouts with not only his otherworldly performance on the mound in his senior year of high school (71 IP, 0.20 ERA, 158 K, 5 BB) but also with his intense workouts and work ethic.    Bundy breezed through the low minors in 2012, promoted from low-A Delmarva after making eight starts without allowing an earned run. He demolished high-A batters for 12 starts and had made three starts for the double-A Bowie Baysox when the Orioles called him up for a taste of the big leagues in September. It was Bundy's goal to pitch in the\xc2\xa0 majors before he turned 20 years old, and the Orioles obliged. He made two appearances out of the bullpen before he was shut down for the season, and when he showed up for spring training in 2013 everyone had high hopes. That's when the pain started, and after three months of trying to rehab, Bundy underwent Tommy John surgery on June 27, 2013. He spent the rest of 2013 and half of 2014 resting and rehabbing, and was finally ready to start a professional baseball game on June 15, 2014. Bundy's 2014 debut was with the short-season Aberdeen Ironbirds, and he spent three starts there before he was moved up to pitch for the high-A Frederick Keys. The Orioles kept him on a pitch count of 75 during these starts, and if you were following him through the box scores you may not have been impressed. But after spending a year away from competitive baseball, the fact is that Dylan Bundy had to re-learn how to pitch. His fastball velocity before his injury was in the upper-90s and he spent much of his 2014 season in the low-90s, only\xc2\xa0 starting to touch 95 towards the end of his season. He had to work on location and on secondary pitches and get his surgically repaired elbow back into game condition. In nine starts between Aberdeen and Frederick between June 15th and August 5th, Bundy pitched 41 1/3 innings. He struck out fewer batters than he had before his injury, walked more, and didn't throw as hard. But while it's almost always the case that you can't evaluate minor leaguers by their stats alone, it is especially the case for a pitcher returning from major arm surgery. The results don't matter. His health matters. On August 15th, Bundy was shut down with two weeks left in the minor league season due to a strained lat muscle. It's not the best way to end a season, but it's not an elbow or shoulder injury, so it's not worth worrying about.    Thanks to his injury, a bit of shine has come off of Bundy as a prospect. Ranked by most reputable sources in the top five of prospects in all of baseball before the 2013 season, he dropped to 15-30 prior to 2014. ESPN analyst Keith Law ranked Bundy at #31 prior to the start of the 2014 season, but in his mid-season review bumped him all the way up to #12 based on his observation that he is most of the way back from TJ surgery. Tucker Blair of Baseball Prospectus and Orioles Nation saw Bundy pitch in July and gave a rave review, saying that Bundy is one of the most polished pitchers in the minors and that all of his pitches grade as plus or potentially plus. 2015 will be a big year for Dylan Bundy. He will have had a healthy off-season to prepare for spring training, and he'll have to prove that he's all the way back from his surgery and ready to help the Orioles at the major-league level. Even if he doesn't break camp with the Orioles at the start of the 2015 season, you have to hope to see him in Baltimore sooner rather than later.

And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we saw happen with Norris yesterday. Tampa takes a lot of pitches, and as I said that wears out your pitching staff.Tampa got to Norris early on with Evan Longoria and James Loney smacking back-to-back homers in the first inning. DeJesus added a homer \xe2\x80\x93 an inside-the-parker at that -in the fourth, and it appeared that the O\xe2\x80\x99s were destined to be swept in Tampa this weekend. However sometimes you have to live on a prayer and attempt to force destiny to adapt to you. (Oriole opponents have been doing it for years so it seems \xe2\x80\x93 until now, that is.) Following a lead off single by David Lough, Nelson Cruz cut the Tampa lead to 3-2 with a two-run homer in the sixth. We weren\xe2\x80\x99t done yet\xe2\x80\xa6not by a long shot.Kiermaier, in typical Tampa\xc2\xa0anything you can do I can do better fashion, led off the last of the inning with a homer to run the score to 4-2. While this was far from a must-win for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, you\xe2\x80\x99d rather not go on after being swept. Especially when you\xe2\x80\x99re going to play a very dangerous team that\xe2\x80\x99s out of the race in Boston. So with two runners on in the ninth Buck Showalter sent Adam Jones up as a pinch hitter. Jones dropped a bloop single into left field, which loaded the bases. That brought Cruz to the plate, with the Baltimore Orioles just hanging on by a prayer\xe2\x80\xa6and he\xc2\xa0sent a bases-clearing triple to right field which gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 5-4 lead.But we still weren\xe2\x80\x99t done \xe2\x80\x93 remember,\xc2\xa0anything you can do I can do better?

So bearing that in mind, Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s next at-bat came with the score still tied at seven in the top of the 11th. Following a one-out walk by Nick Hundley, Cruz came to the plate and played the role of a wide receiver running a go route as the Birds dialed up a Hail Mary.Cruz finished off his seven-RBI game with a two-run homer that gave the Orioles a lead, which ended up as a 7-5 victory.

09/09/2014,"[('Prospect season in review: Adrian Marin - Camden Chat', "" When the Orioles drafted Adrian Marin out of a Miami area high school in the third round of the 2012 draft, the young shortstop was so excited that he posted a picture of himself in an Orioles hat, signing his contract, before it was even official. He still had to take the legendary Orioles physical. He passed. It's hard not to like someone who displays so much exuberance about joining the organization. You want them to beat the odds and turn into the next star or even superstar.    Marin, still only 20, spent his second full season in the organization playing for the High-A Frederick Keys in the Carolina League. He was nearly three years younger than the average player in that league. That's the kind of thing that is important to keep in mind when considering a player's performance that, on paper, looks pretty underwhelming. They can't all be fast-moving marvels like Mike Trout or Manny Machado. If that was Marin's level of talent, he would have been a first rounder, not #99 overall. The reminder about being young for his league is important because it was not a banner year for Marin when it came to hitting. Over 430 plate appearances in 115 games for the Keys, he batted only .232/.271/.341, showing some respectable speed with 30 doubles and 12 stolen bases, but little in the way of power or ability to make contact. That followed on the heels of a .667 OPS he hit for in Delmarva last year. Though young for both leagues when he played in them, it still seems fair to figure that offense is not going to be a calling card for Marin. Nor does it need to be, given that he plays a middle infield position. However, he'll need to get up to at least some bare minimum level to be able to make it farther up the system, let alone to the big leagues.    In the prospect rankings on MLB.com before the season, Marin was considered the #11 prospect in the system - a name worth knowing, but not anyone who would be in line for any immediate impact. By season's end, that same list ranked him as the #13 prospect in the O's organization. That's not exactly falling off the radar, but it means he didn't grow like the team had hoped, either. Other players passed him while he stayed in place.    Before the season, Marin was also considered the best defensive infielder in the Orioles system\xc2\xa0by Baseball America, although that may be a reflection of a lack of competition more than anything. He made 15 errors while playing short for the Keys this season. That sounds bad, although you shouldn't judge a minor leaguer by his errors. After all, Machado had 19 errors between Delmarva and Frederick in 2011 and committed 23 errors in Bowie in 2012 before his MLB call-up where he helped the Orioles into the playoffs with his amazing defense. That's not to say that Marin is going to turn into Machado out there, either, but you shouldn't write him off yet. That said, there are questions about whether he'll be able to remain at shortstop in the long run. Baseball Prospectus' Tucker Blair\xc2\xa0reported on Marin back in April and made note of a fringe arm that could ultimately be destined for second base. A solid defensive second baseman who's a bit light with the bat can still have value, although of course it's no sure thing that Marin could even develop into that.    With the way he performed this year, it wouldn't be a surprise to see Marin start out the 2015 season repeating in Frederick. He'll still be just 21, which is young-ish for that level, especially for a player who was picked out of high school. If the O's agree with the idea that his future may not be at shortstop, he may have to get adjusted to a new position on the diamond as well. Every year is an important year for a minor leaguer. The nature of the system is that there are always new people pushing up from below you. It's especially going to be important for Marin to keep himself moving forward. Before long, if he doesn't get better, he might find himself in the level of player who gets shuffled off to another team in a Dan Duquette August trade. I'll be rooting for him.

First, the Athletics inked Yoenis Cespedes. A few months later, the Cubs snapped up Jorge Soler. And on July 6, 2012, the Orioles signed Henry Urrutia for\xc2\xa0a signing bonus of $778,500. He was, without question, the least flashy of the trio.    Urrutia was making his second defection attempt out of Cuba. He failed once before back in 2010 and was suspended for the entire 2011 season in Cuba as a result. Then, after the O\'s penned him, he ran into visa issues when he tried to come to the United States to be assigned somewhere in the Orioles minor league system. He managed to get things figured out in the early goings of the 2013 season. He was initially assigned to double-A Bowie, but was able to earn his way up to Triple-A Norfolk and, eventually, all the way to Baltimore. He showed a knack for hitting singles the opposite way and earned a spot as the Orioles seventh ranked prospect, according to Baseball America, following the season. Prior to the start of the season, Baseball America had Urrutia listed as the best hitter for average in the O\'s farm system. You wouldn\'t guess that by looking at how his 2014 worked out.    In spring training there was talk that he may battle with David Lough and Francisco Peguero (among others) for time in the outfielder on the big club. Maybe he could get some swings at DH. But, he showed little improvement in the areas that the team was concerned about.    In 17 games he hit one home run and five doubles, which amounted to an OK slugging percentage of .452. However, he had seemed to lose his ability to hit for average, posting just a .262 batting average and one walk. And the Orioles did not see enough change in his work with the glove to put him on the opening day roster. His fielding has long been an issue of contention for some. Following the 2013 Futures Game, in which Urrutia went 0-for-3 at the plate,\xc2\xa0Baseball Prospectus\' Zach Mortimer said "" I\xe2\x80\x99ve already made up my mind on Urrutia defensively, and if he\xe2\x80\x99s not stinging it at the plate, I\'m not especially interested.""    Fair enough, he is a corner outfielder. Their defense can be forgiven if they put up offensive numbers. We all know that rings true for the Orioles as much, as any other team, in left field. Unfortunately for Urrutia, he has been doing anything but ""stinging it"" in 2014. His year began with Norfolk. There, he was pretty awful for the first month of the season. After April 27, here is what his slash line looked like: .220/.250/.293. Those kind of numbers aren\'t even really passable as a middle infielder, let alone a left fielder who isn\'t especially adept with the leather. The left-handed hitting outfielder then missed all of May and June with a sports hernia injury. He returned to the field on July 5 as a member of the Gulf Coast Orioles and was just as bad there, hitting .230 with an on base percentage of .255. He walked three times in the whole month of July.    On August 1, he headed back up north to the Tides and things began to look up. His return was a three-hit performance where he also stole a base; one of his two swiped bags on the season. Urrutia hit better all around once he came back from his elongated rehab stint with Gulf Coast. The Tides season ended on September 1. In that final month, the 6-foot-3 Cuban hit .310 with an on-base percentage of .317 and slugging of .370. It helped improve his final slash line to .270/.284/.338. In Triple-A this season, he had 12 doubles, 17 RBI and zero home runs in 51 games. We could give him the benefit of the doubt and talk about how he went on the DL a month into the season and was likely hurt before that. That could have led to him not being able to get as strong as he would like. But wait, back in January the Baltimore Sun\'s Eduardo Encina\xc2\xa0reported that Urrutia had added nearly 20 pounds of muscle to his lanky frame. He was tipping the scales at 201. So, what happened? It certainly was not reflected in his play on the field. Maybe his body just can\'t handle more muscle. This apparent combination of poor defense and the inability to hit home runs just doesn\'t seem to fit on this Oriole roster any time soon. But Baltimore isn\'t about to give up on him. He needs to get a fully healthy season in and, even then, he would have to be at least third in the pecking order of left field candidates who are set to return behind Alejandro De Aza and David Lough (Delmon Young and Nelson Cruz are on one-year deals).    2015 is set to be a make or break type of year for the Cuban as it could be with so many other Oriole prospects.

The franchise\'s recent history explains an awful lot (along with America\'s changed preferences) about how I\'ve just become accustomed to turning mostly to football as soon as the calendar hits September. \xc2\xa0It\'s been a long time since I had September baseball that mattered, 2012 aside. \xc2\xa0Now, the Orioles are awesome, and I\'m starting to drift away from early season football, even as America went through its normal Week One rituals a few days ago.    Let me start this out by stating it right up front: If you watch football games, you are not a bad person. \xc2\xa0You are not a direct enabler of domestic violence, or racism, or post-concussive disorder, or whatever else breathless bloggers would have you believe in order to get pageviews while there are sensationally horrible things in the headlines as this year\'s NFL season kicks off. \xc2\xa0If you want to watch professional football, the NFL is the only game in town, and it\'s perfectly reasonable to want the league to shape up and get serious about its many flaws, without jumping to an all-out boycott. However, let\'s also be real about this: \xc2\xa0The NFL makes virtually all of its money from selling national TV rights. \xc2\xa0If you watch the NFL, you are perpetuating its success at a time when it could maybe use a little bit of humility and reflection. \xc2\xa0When you add it all up -- the willful ignorance of the aftereffects of concussions, the deliberate avoidance of a meaningful conversation about the Redskins\' name, the completely bungled handling of the Ray Rice incident at every turn -- you start to develop a picture of a league with the kind of hubris that would probably make Bob McDonnell shake his head. By the way, if you believe the official version of events -- that neither the NFL nor the Ravens saw the inside-the-elevator video until the same time you did, and then acted decisively, because it was the right thing to do based on heretofore unknown information -- please contact me for an amazing selection of bridges, available for immediate delivery at incredible prices.    The Orioles are going to win the AL East for the first time since 1997, and it\'s going to be awesome. \xc2\xa0Even after they clinch, they\'ll be playing for playoff seeding. \xc2\xa0And when they make the playoffs, they\'ll play some October baseball on Sundays, Mondays and Thursdays. \xc2\xa0So whether you\'re a Ravens fan or a Redskins fan (oh, and spoiler alert, they\'re both pretty bad anyway), or a fan of some other team entirely, maybe this isn\'t a bad year to let the NFL wait for your viewership until the Orioles win the World Series, or get knocked out of the playoffs if we can\'t have such nice things.    On Sunday, I made a somewhat conscious decision to skip Week One. \xc2\xa0The NFL has always been my secondary interest (and slipping even further in recent years), but usually I\'ll start flipping back and forth between football and baseball on Sundays. \xc2\xa0This year, I decided to just watch the Orioles play the Rays while I did some other things. \xc2\xa0It wasn\'t a great game, but the Orioles won, thanks to one-man wrecking ball Nelson Cruz, and you know what? \xc2\xa0I didn\'t really miss the NFL very much at all. \xc2\xa0And I felt pretty OK about not giving them my viewership. Sure, ""Blogger feels good about self for sports viewing habits"" isn\'t going to change the world or make the NFL change its ways. \xc2\xa0And it\'s not a revolutionary sentiment.    But give it a try. \xc2\xa0The Orioles are really good, in a way they haven\'t been in a really long time (2012 might have been more exciting/unexpected/magical, but this year they\'re just dominating) -- good enough, for the first time in a long time, to argue that they\'re worth ditching football for, even temporarily. \xc2\xa0Timed along with the unconscionable foolishness of the NFL on a lot of fronts, maybe it\'s not a bad time at all to try out some September and October Sunday afternoon baseball.

But anyone who saw yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game knows that the score is probably not indicative of how the game unfolded. Some folks will probably say that the slight hiccup by the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen in the ninth inning could signify problems down the road \xe2\x80\x93 and this is not to say that it might not. However Joe Saunders was the pitcher who came on to close out the game, and he was the one who gave up the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of the runs late. As soon as Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day came out of the bullpen, the game was quickly over. O\xe2\x80\x99Day almost certainly will be on the post season roster; Saunders probably will not.Wei-Yin Chen gave the Orioles a strong effort in a starting role yesterday, in a game which featured 5.1 innings of perfect baseball before Chen allowed a double. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 0 BB, 4 K. While the \xe2\x80\x98pen ended up playing a larger role in the end, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not Chen\xe2\x80\x99s doing; having a starter going deep at this point in the season where the Orioles are in the standings is huge. Especially when you have a bullpen as strong as that of the Orioles. The fresher they are for those crisp October evenings, the better.The\xc2\xa0Boston Massacre\xc2\xa0moniker probably comes from the third inning, when the O\xe2\x80\x99s did much of their damage. Alejandro De Aza continued his dominance over Boston pitching with an RBI-single, and he would come into score on Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 two-RBI double. Later in the inning, Steve Pearce would draw a bases loaded walk, which gave the Baltimore Orioles a 4-0 lead. Caleb Joseph and Ryan Flaherty would each add RBI-singles, as the O\xe2\x80\x99s batted around in the inning and gave themselves a 6-0 cushion.Througout this series, the Orioles seemed to be playing for a purpose where as Boston seemed to be \xe2\x80\x9cmailing it in\xe2\x80\x9d (this according to ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Sportscenter last night). And I say that as someone who knows what it looks like to mail it in come September. To draw a comparison, the O\xe2\x80\x99s never really stopped playing for the post season last September. The ended up with lots of tired bats and lots of guys who just ran out of gas. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they ever faced a mismatch similar to what we saw from Boston in this series.In his next turn at the plate in the fifth inning, Caleb Joseph would add a two-run homer to run the lead to 8-0 in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 favor.Courtesy of Greg M. Cooper-USA TODAY SportsBoston\xe2\x80\x99s Xavier Bogaert\xe2\x80\x99s would add a solo homer in the seventh to get the BoSox on the board, but two RBI-doubles (one from Flaherty and one from Kelly Johnson) in the top of the ninth would run the lead to 10-1. Boston would push out the aforementioned rally in the last of the ninth with a two-RBI double by Daniel Nava and a Rivero three-run homer off of Joe Saunders. However again, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day ended the game when it needed to be ended, sending the Orioles home.The Birds will now head home where they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a day off today, and one in which several of the players will attend tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Ravens/ Steelers game. Of course on the other end of that day off the Birds will open up a grudge match with the NY Yankees, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll pick up a fight that they started in 1996. But more on that tomorrow. The O\xe2\x80\x99s swept Boston in convincing fashion this week, as the clock ticks down even further.On a side note, we at Birds Watcher join all Americans in taking pause today to remember the events of September 11, 2001. It was a day that will never be forgotten, and\xc2\xa0a day when our country found herself in the depths of strife. However one where we also saw the bravery and honor of our fellow countrymen \xe2\x80\x93 from the fields of Pennsylvannia to the streets of Manhattan. May we never forget the victims of those heinous acts, and may we always remember that we live in perpetual freedom due in part to those who took the initiative to defend it that day.

While the playoff rotation clearly has five candidates fighting for four spots, there are many more names to consider for the 8 spots in the bullpen. Let's run through each of the likely candidates by where they stand in the race.    Locks: Demoted Starter, Zach Britton, Andrew Miller, Darren O'Day There is no question that the demoted starter would serve as the long man out of the bullpen. Whoever that may be, he could be able to provide more innings at higher quality than T.J. McFarland, who served in this role during the regular season. The trio of Britton, Miller and O'Day will unquestionably be included on the playoff roster unless injured. They represent the strength of the back end of the O's bullpen and there should be no argument about their inclusion. Near-Locks: Tommy Hunter, Brian Matusz Both Hunter and Matusz have been shaky at time this season. However, their overall numbers do not deviate wildly from their numbers last season. Hunter has an ERA of 3.27 after posting an ERA of 2.81 last season. Meanwhile, Matusz's ERA has risen slightly from 3.53 to 3.61. Their peripherals have also remained relatively stable. Moreover, both of them have a huge career platoon split, so their strength can be emphasized by putting them in the right situations, which should be a point of focus in the playoffs where every matchup is critical. On the Bubble: Brad Brach, T.J. McFarland, Ryan Webb Most likely, the two remaining bullpen spots will come down to Brach, McFarland and Webb. Brach and McFarland are the safe bets given they were the choices made by Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter following the acquisition of Miller. I am including Webb here primarily out of the hope that he will replace either Brach or McFarland. Both serve as multiple inning relievers, and there will be another one in the bullpen in the playoffs in the form of the demoted starter. Moreover, McFarland does not exhibit a strong platoon split, and he has allowed a higher wOBA against both right-handed and left handed batters this season than Webb and Brach.    Longshot: Ubaldo Jimenez, Evan Meek They are here for the sake of completeness. Jimenez has not appeared in a close game since his demotion from the rotation. On the other hand, Meek has spent the majority of the season in the minors, though he has made appearances in some of the most critical situations for the O's when he is in the majors. Meek is the last guy I want to see included on the playoffs roster, especially given Buck's propensity to use him.   The ideal bullpen in my mind would consist of the demoted starter, Britton, O'Day, Miller, Hunter, Matusz, Brach and Webb. I do not believe that this is the choice the O's front office and coaching staff will make, but I would feel comfortable with their choice as long as Meek is not part of it.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Prospect season in review: Josh Hart - Camden Chat', "" The year did not open ideally for Josh Hart. Writers eager to find Spring Training stories to file jumped at the chance to have some fun at his expense after Orioles manager Buck Showalter related that Hart was less than well-versed as to the accomplishments of Frank Robinson. Headlines spread out across the interwebz such as 'Orioles, Buck Showalter give Josh Hart a history lesson', or 'Orioles prospect doesn't know who Frank Robinson is', etc...It was a mildly amusing lede, and, of course, an embellished one. Hart took the attention in stride, produced the 1 page report on Robinson that Buck requested, and showed himself to be mature beyond his 19 years.    Following his selection with the 37th overall pick in the 2013 MLB draft, Hart made brief stops at the Orioles' Sarasota complex in the Gulf Coast League as well as with the Short Season-A Aberdeen Ironbirds. Prospect lists had a wide range of opinion concerning Hart's pre-season ranking, with\xc2\xa0MLB.com placing him 6th in the O's organizational hierarchy,\xc2\xa0Baseball Prospectus slotting him in at 10th, and John Sickels placing him at 16th. The consensus view was that Hart exhibited tremendous potential as a defensive center fielder and a possible speedy lead off hitter with very little power, but that he would face a long journey in translating his athletic abilities into specific baseball skills. He was assigned to the full season Low-A Delmarva Shorebirds at the start of the 2014 season; a rather aggressive assignment considering he would be facing competition on average 2 years older than him. And the difference in experience showed as Hart's bat, not necessarily struggled but was certainly overmatched at the start of the season, compiling a line of .266 / .301 / .273 with 7 walks to 37 strikeouts over 154 plate appearances and 6 stolen bases out of 8 attempts through late May. In spite of his offensive scuffles he never let his defense go into a funk, making\xc2\xa0spectacular diving catches such as this.    Then came his first taste of injury at the professional level. On May 26th, in the 2nd game of a double-header Hart tore the meniscus in his right knee. Viewed as a 4-6 week injury, he would ultimately miss just one month of action, returning for a rehab assignment with the Orioles GCL affiliate on June 26th. After a week in Sarasota he proved himself ready to return to action with the Shorebirds. Over the final 2 months of the season he would amass a slash line very similar to his first 2 months: .246 / .302 / .295 with 14 walks to 49 strikeouts over 199 plate appearances and 5 stolen bases out of 8 attempts. He was showing particular statistical improvement over the last month of the season, going .276 / .344 / .333. Baseball Prospectus' Tucker Blair was suitably impressed with Hart's development after seeing him play in late July. In\xc2\xa0his report he wrote  The consistent, short stroke from Hart works often, although the production remains hollow at this time. Hart makes a ton of contact, but he is still learning the in's and out's of the game. I can see the development from early April simply from his approach at the plate. He is progressing even though there has been little evidence. Hart is going to see production once he gets more acclimated with professional ball. Some of his best AB this series was against Giolito, where he showed progression and refinement from his first AB to the last.   Hart will turn 20 years old in October. It's reasonable to expect that he will begin the 2015 season in Delmarva again. He would still be a year younger than the average competition, it would allow him to demonstrate any adjustments he has made to that level of competition, and possible provide him a chance to build some early confidence in his offensive skills before possibly earning promotion to High-A Frederick.    As for where he will rank come prospect list time, he's not yet even close to sniffing a top-100 overall list. But one will likely find him on the back end of most every Orioles specific Top-10 list. In terms of Orioles positional prospects he likely will trail the likes of the more advanced Christian Walker, Mike Yastrzemski, and Dariel Alvarez. While Chance Sisco's massively successful offensive season with Delmarva will catch a ton of attention, his ultimate defensive home is still an open question. Any potential ranking is still heavily dependent on one's view of his ultimate potential, but he did nothing to dissuade one from believing he could be the heir to Adam Jones as the Orioles center fielder come 2018.

It was devastating news because the 25-game suspension extends well into the postseason, where the Orioles seem destined to play.Still, just a few hours later, the Orioles were jumping and dancing on the infield grass at Camden Yards. As it turned out, Friday\xe2\x80\x99s events were even more devastating for the Yankees, who lost in crushing fashion and certainly do not appear headed to the playoffs.The Orioles, despite the loss of one of their most dangerous hitters, were celebrating because they had come from behind to beat the Yankees, 2-1, in 11 innings when pinch-hitter Jimmy Paredes lined a two-out, two-run double off Adam Warren, leaving the Yankees looking stunned and helpless as they walked off the field.But that was only the beginning. In the second game, the Orioles won, 5-0, to record their first doubleheader sweep of the Yankees since 1984. In 20 innings over roughly nine hours, the Yankees struck out 25 times and scored only once, as their already-slim playoff hopes dissipated even further.

But it\xe2\x80\x99s something that still caught the clubhouse, the coaches, and writers like me way off guard. Nobody seemed to blame the Baltimore Orioles for coming out a bit flat in the first game yesterday. Yet they still managed to pull through and find a way to win. As for the night cap \xe2\x80\x93 well, you see the title\xe2\x80\xa6big wheels just keep on turning.An Oriole starter, this time Bud Norris, once again set the tone for the game by going deep. Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 7 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 2 BB, 10 K. Granted it gets your pitch count up pretty high, but the ten strikeouts are pretty impressive. Norris has pin point control, and he\xe2\x80\x99s very good at working out of jams. Granted New York didn\xe2\x80\x99t really cause him too much agitation last night, however when guys did get on base he was about to find ways out.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsFollowing a lead off walk in the fourth, David Lough was sacrificed to second base and he would come into score on Ryan Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double. Alejandro De Aza would add an RBI-triple later in the inning, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were off to a 2-0 lead.  I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure there\xe2\x80\x99s a player in baseball who\xe2\x80\x99s made an immediate of an impact on a team to whom he was traded during the season than De Aza. After the game he told reporters that he feels like he\xe2\x80\x99s 20 again now that he\xe2\x80\x99s with the Orioles.  It\xe2\x80\x99s contributions like his which will be what ultimately gets the Orioles through the Davis suspension.Delmon Young\xe2\x80\x99s two-RBI double in the last of the seventh gave the Orioles some breathing room, and then De Aza would add another RBI-triple in the eighth to run the score to 5-0. Brian Matusz came in to pitch the ninth in a non-save situation, and sent New York down 1-2-3 to close out the game .This was the first time since September of 1984 that the Baltimore Orioles have swept New York in a doubleheader. And while it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t alleviate the sting of losing Davis in the manner that the Orioles lost him, it just adds to their momentum. They\xe2\x80\x99re now in the midst of a six-game winning streak, their longest of the season. And it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go lost on fans that all six of those games are against AL East opponents. Now some might point out that the O\xe2\x80\x99s won\xe2\x80\x99t be facing AL East foes come October, and ironically that\xe2\x80\x99s a valid point. But you just have to play hard against whomever you\xe2\x80\x99re playing on any given day.The O\xe2\x80\x99s also swept this doubleheader without the benefit of a home run, which is interesting. Granted they got two RBI-triples out of De Aza, but is it possible that this team is learning to do things without hitting the ball out of the ballpark? In a bit of a preview of tomorrow, I had the opportunity to speak via telephone with ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Dan Shulman about the Orioles earlier this week. One of the questions I asked him is if the Birds need to do anything or if they\xe2\x80\x99re lacking in any area to be a more complete team for October. First off, Shulman was very complimentary of the Orioles and he said that all around they\xe2\x80\x99re a great team. He said that one slight concern that he would have might be their reliance on the home run ball. But obviously that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary yesterday.The series continues this afternoon in a game that will be aired on FOX Sports at 1 PM. Miguel Gonzalez will get the ball for the Orioles, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by NY\xe2\x80\x99s Sean Greene. With the sweep of the doubleheader combined with Toronto losing in Tampa, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 magic number to clinch the AL East is down to 5. Again, some might have thought that losing Chris Davis might have been a crippling blow to this team.

09/14/2014,"[(""ESPN's Dan Shulman on the Baltimore Orioles"", 'With\xc2\xa0tonight\xe2\x80\x99s series finale against New York being broadcast on ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday Night Baseball, Dan Shulman and John Kruk are in town to handle the play-by-play and color commentary. First off let me state that I\xe2\x80\x99m a huge fan of the concept of the Sunday night game, and thus Baltimore Orioles fans should be honored to see the Birds being showcased like this. The idea of course is that most teams play afternoon games on Sundays, save for the one \xe2\x80\x9cgame of the week\xe2\x80\x9d which airs on national TV in prime time.\xc2\xa0Photo courtesy of ESPNNevertheless, I had the opportunity to speak over the telephone with the aforementioned Dan Shulman, who of course is \xe2\x80\x9cThe Voice of Sunday Night Baseball.\xe2\x80\x9d I feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s good for Orioles fans to get a national perspective on the team, as I suspect that many folks are tired of hearing people like me talk and write about them! However national pundits such as Mr. Shulman will always have a wider view of any team and/or players, so it\xe2\x80\x99s always interesting to hear their opinions. Below is an outline/summary of my conversation with Mr. Shulman:Domenic: With Chris Tillman on the mound for the Orioles tonight, how does he stack up compared to most of the \xe2\x80\x9caces\xe2\x80\x9d that you see league-wide?Dan Shulman:\xc2\xa0Tillman doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the career accomplishments of a Max Scherzer or Justin Verlander as of yet for sure. But he\xe2\x80\x99s a guy to whom you can give the ball on a weekly basis and get a good quality start. Based on his statistics of late, he\xe2\x80\x99s as much of an ace as any of those guys.Domenic:\xc2\xa0Do you feel that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that the Orioles need to do to make themselves a more complete team prior to the postseason?Dan Shulman: The Orioles have had a great season,\xc2\xa0 and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten enough credit for how things have gone. When you combine the fact that Davis hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been what he was expected to be, Machado\xe2\x80\x99s injuries plus suspension, Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 injury, etc, they\xe2\x80\x99re a very good team and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t received the credit that they deserve to this point. If there\xe2\x80\x99s one concern out there it might be their reliance on the home run ball to score so many of their runs, but they\xe2\x80\x99re finding ways to win and the fact is that they don\xe2\x80\x99t get enough credit for that.Domenic: In going around the league each week with Sunday Night Baseball, how do you feel that Adam Jones stacks up compared to some of the other center fielders league-wide?Dan Shulman: Similar to the team overall Adam Jones doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get enough credit for being the great center fielder that he is. I think that he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best players in baseball.\xc2\xa0Domenic: With the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen being as strong as it is, how big of an advantage can that be in a post season series?Dan Shulman: Everyone knows how important a decent closer is, and the Orioles have a good one in Zach Britton. But I think that the 7th\xc2\xa0and 8th\xc2\xa0inning guys are equally if not more important to a team. A bullpen of their caliber is a huge advantage in October. Andrew Miller was a great acquisition and it\xe2\x80\x99s solidified their pen moreso than it already was. That combined with the likes of Hunter, O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Britton, and Matusz makes them very formidable, espcially with the three lefties.Domenic: What are the odds of seeing a Beltway World Series?\xc2\xa0Dan Shulman: It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly very possible. Washington is probably the best team in the National League and they have a great roster. The Angels and Dodgers are certainly another local matchup that could occur, as are the Giants and A\xe2\x80\x99s. You never know what happens once you get into October and how things shake down, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a huge surprise.On a personal note, I watch Sunday Night Baseball every Sunday evening after my duties for Birds Watcher are complete; so this was a thrill for me to speak with Mr. Shulman, and on behalf of Birds Watcher and the Fansided Network I really appreciated the time that he gave me.Obviously this conversation took place prior to the announcement of Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 suspension, but obviously that would have worked right into his commentary of how the Orioles are underrated based on the number of big-name players who are missing. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stress enough how complimentary he was of the O\xe2\x80\x99s; when I asked if there was anything that they needed to improve upon overall he almost struggled to come up with something! In fact my response to him was that I thought the bit about relying on home runs was a fair criticism, and he was very quick to correct me and say that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t being critical \xe2\x80\x93 just offering commentary!His views on the bullpen were also very interesting to me. He was very complimentary of the arms that Buck Showalter has out there, as well as how they\xe2\x80\x99re used. My overall takeaway from the conversation was that he really likes and respects the way the Orioles play. The word\xc2\xa0underrated came up several times, both in relation to Adam Jones and in the team overall.I also want to mention that Curt Schilling will make his 2014 debut in the booth tonight with Dan Shulman, John Kruk, and Buster Olney after battling cancer for some time. As the son of a cancer survivor, I tip my cap to him and wish him well. The game of course begins at 8 PM, and will be preceeded by Baseball Tonight Sunday Night Countdown at 7 PM with Karl Ravech and Hall of Famer Barry Larkin. Once again, my thanks to Dan Shulman for being so gracious and taking the time to speak with me.

Hardy (2) after hitting a solo home run in the sixth inning against the New York Yankees at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Yankees won 3-2. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIt may seem like an absolutely ridiculous question to ask if the Baltimore Orioles have enough offense to be a seriously competitive playoffs team. After all, this is the American League team with close to 30 more home runs on the season than the nearest competitor.However, it is not an infrequent occurrence that the Orioles struggle to score many runs and are shut down rather effectively by quality pitching \xe2\x80\x93 the category of pitching sure to be seen in the playoffs. The last three games against the Yankees are an example. It was nice to have scored five runs in the nightcap of the doubleheader, but only two runs could be mustered in each of the other two games. The O\xe2\x80\x99s were fortunate to get the timely hit by Paredes (after Yankees pitching loaded the bases) and escape the 11th inning Friday afternoon with a win.Adding to this question is the recent loss of Chris Davis due to his suspension. Though .196 is a sickly-looking batting average, and though the Orioles are 16-5 in his absence this year, he did account for 26 home runs and 72 RBIs. He remained a fearsome figure in the O\xe2\x80\x99s lineup that could haunt a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s psyche about what could happen with one swing of the bat. \xc2\xa0There is nothing quite like trying to win a world championship with three All-Stars out for the season!And beyond Davis is the continuing cumulative loss of Manny Machado and Matt Wieters. Nothing quite like trying to win a championship with a team that is missing three All-Stars! Without doubt, it would make for a great storyline \xe2\x80\xa6 which is my great hope as a writer.So what about the question that I pose? I recently have put a couple of articles on a site called \xe2\x80\x9cReddit.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m still not quite sure I understand the site, but it is an open forum to be highly criticized if it is anything. I entitled a recent article \xe2\x80\x9cHas Nelson Cruz Carried the Orioles in 2014?\xe2\x80\x9d And a commenter there went off on an academic discussion about how questions asked in titles of articles are known to anticipate answers in the negative.I am truly asking the question without a definitive answer in mind. I am not suggesting that the Orioles do not have sufficient scoring punch, even in light of the personnel losses. But it is true that the good O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching since early June has likely done most to boost the Orioles to a current sum of 88 wins with 14 games to play.Within the American League, it would probably be accurate to rate the overall Orioles offence as about #5 or #6. While they have the most home runs, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are lowest in team speed and triples. They are 10th in doubles and 13th in walks. In a number of categories the Orioles rank fifth overall \xe2\x80\x93 such as in average runs per game, total runs, hits, and batting average. Again, it altogether sums up as about fifth, or maybe sixth in the league.There is certainly enough talent on this roster to take 13-14 quality hitters into the rounds of the playoffs. However, the primary players are going to be needing to perform at a high level, and the \xe2\x80\x9cfiller\xe2\x80\x9d players will be called upon to contribute sufficiently to keep the lineup turning over.I think we could identify five primary players who will need to be the backbone to carry this offence: Nelson Cruz, Adam Jones, Nick Markakis, Steve Pearce and Nick Markakis. The Baltimore Orioles will need most of these five to be hitting well going into the playoffs. So how are they doing over the past 20 games? \xc2\xa0 More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryCruz \xe2\x80\x93 .304 \xe2\x80\x93 with five home runsJones \xe2\x80\x93 .263Markakis \xe2\x80\x93 .153Pearce \xe2\x80\x93 .290Hardy \xe2\x80\x93 .261Though none of us would have imagined this just a few weeks ago, the best of the rest would appear to be Alejandro De Aza. Since joining the Orioles he has played nine games and is 13-for-37 (.351). His speed is an asset, as well as his defense and left-handed bat. He will be in the lineup.Filling in the holes at second base and third base will be some mixture of Jonathan Schoop, Ryan Flaherty, Jimmy Paredes and Kelly Johnson. Schoop is currently in a pretty serious funk at only 3-for-35 in his past nine games (.210 on the season), whereas Flaherty has picked it up lately and has 10 hits over his past 24 at-bats. Paredes has played well since coming to the Orioles (11-for-28), though his career numbers are not stellar, as is true also of Johnson.Caleb Joseph has struggled more of late, though he is the better defensive catcher. Nick Hundley has hit much better over the past month. They will likely continue to split time into the playoffs, but the Orioles need offensive contributions from them to be successful.We are in an era with decreased offensive production, and playoffs offense is generally even less per game than in the regular season. Can the Orioles produce enough, while hoping also that the pitching holds on to its current level of quality performance?What do y\xe2\x80\x99all think? ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles vs. Yankees lineups and pitching preview for ...', "" I know it's considered an honor or a sign that your team is good or whatever to be on ESPN's broadcast of Sunday Night Baseball, but I'm not a fan. I don't want to be up that late on a school night! And I don't want longer commercial breaks! And I don't want to listen to the ESPN announcers act like the Yankees are the ones in contention and not the Orioles! And I DO want Gary Thorne and Jim Palmer! OK, I got that out of my system.    The Orioles are looking to take three of four in this series against the Yankees with a win tonight. The pitching match up is #StaffAce Chris Tilman vs Hiroki Kuroda. Tillman can still say that he hasn't given up more than three earned runs since June 5th, but his last few starts haven't been the strongest of the season. In two of the last three he's only gone five innings, and in the third he went just six. The Orioles won all of those game, and in fact haven't lost a game started by Tillman in his last nine starts. This will be Tillman's fourth start against the Yankees this season, and he's done pretty well against them. Twice he's pitched seven innings, and one six and two-thirds, giving up a total of just five runs. He did walk four in one start but somehow didn't allow any runs at all. Tillman sits at 187.2 innings for the season and is looking to top 200 for the second straight season. If he pitches every fifth game until the end of the season he'll have three more starts including tonight's. That gives him a very good shot to reach 200, but once the Orioles clinch it's possible Tillman won't get that third start.    At 39 years old, Hiroki Kuroda is having his worst season since coming to the MLB. But that's not to say he's having a terrible season, because he isn't. His 3.91 ERA is just a touch below league average and he's managed to stay healthy for the entire season, unlike his younger teammates who started the season with him. Kuroda has faced the Orioles three times this season and gave up just two runs in each start. Most of the Orioles have had very little success against Kiroda.

The loss snapped the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 six-game winning streak, their longest of the season to date.

Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 3 H, 3 R, 3 BB, 1 K. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s problem was that New York\xe2\x80\x99s starter was just as great \xe2\x80\x93 if not a bit stronger. Sean Greene dominated the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup, which is still somewhat in flux due to the absence of Chris Davis. what\xe2\x80\x99s unknown is who will play where each day; what\xe2\x80\x99s guaranteed is that if history is any indication, Buck Showalter and the players on this team will find a way.Gonzalez struggled to find the strike zone in the second inning to the point to where Showalter actually got the bullpen going. But he righted himself \xe2\x80\x93 after putting the O\xe2\x80\x99s in a three-run hole. Brian McCann smacked his first homer on the road since May to give NY a 1-0 lead. Following a walk and a double, Richardson would stroke an RBI-single to score one more. Richardson and Chris Young (who was on third) attempted a double steal, which was successful and gave New York a 3-0 lead. You don\xe2\x80\x99t often see a straight steal of home plate so often anymore, which might be part of why the Orioles were caught off-gaurd. However Gonzalez righted himself after that, and buckled down to retire the side.Nelson Cruz scored Nick Markakis on an RBI-single in the last of the third, however that was the most the Birds could muster for some time. This was a classic pitchers duel, and withstanding the second inning Gonzalez held up his end of the bargain. Steve Pearce wouldCourtesy of Joy R.

Unfortunately for the Birds, Toronto beat Tampa yesterday afternoon as well so the magic number remains at five. If Tampa can beat Toronto this afternoon, it could be down to four by the time the O\xe2\x80\x99s take the field this evening in the series finale with New York.\xc2\xa0This game was played simultaneous to the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Star Spangled Banner a few blocks away at Fort McHenry.

[Editorial]Our view: At age 200, the national anthem still speaks to a nation\'s perseverance, pride and gratitudeSeptember 14, 2014Whether ""Baltimore \xe2\x80\x94 Birthplace of the Star-Spangled Banner"" is destined to become the city\'s official motto, as the City Council recently endorsed, is less important than a troubling bit of information that arose during the council\'s debate over the matter. Polls suggest only about one in five people living in Baltimore know of the city\'s link to the national anthem and even fewer are aware of it outside this state.This weekend\'s festivities may change that \xe2\x80\x94 although probably modestly so given that the PBS\' Great Performances series doesn\'t exactly have the ratings of a ""reality"" TV show, let alone a major sporting event. That a 35-year-old lawyer named Francis Scott Key wrote a poem 200 years ago today as a tribute to what he had witnessed the day before \xe2\x80\x94 the day-long barrage of Fort McHenry by shells and rockets during what would later be known as the Battle of Baltimore \xe2\x80\x94 deserves greater recognition.As national anthems go, ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" is not ideal. It\'s notoriously difficult to sing; the range required is too great and the lyrics too difficult for some to remember. The battle it commemorates is a forgotten one in a war about which there are ambivalent feelings. At best, the War of 1812 reaffirmed American independence. It is a conflict upstaged in the history books by the Revolutionary War before it and the Civil War after. var adSkipCounter = 0; But that is no excuse for the average denizen of this city to know the national anthem only as the song in which one expresses pride in the Baltimore Orioles baseball team by shouting, ""O!"" in the second-to-last verse, as in, ""O! say does that star-spangled banner yet wave."" The Star-Spangled Banner is Baltimore\'s. It was written here. The battle it commemorates was fought here. Even the giant flag that Key saw that day was created here by a 29-year-old widow named Mary Young Pickersgill. It ought to be as closely identified with Charm City as steamed crabs and cold beer.Americans sing this song frequently, but do they listen closely to it? The tune itself is a hand-me-down, derived from an uplifting, slightly bawdy little ditty called the ""The Anacreontic Song"" written for an exclusive gentleman\'s club (a place for the affluent to drink and sing, mostly) in London and adapted frequently by others including in America. Mr. Key\'s words are what really matter. After the devastating bombardment he had witnessed, he was obviously stunned to see the young nation\'s flag still flying the morning of Sept. 14.This is why the anthem can still inspire, not merely because it celebrates a little-known battle in an often-forgotten war but because it speaks to the American character. We overcome the adversity thrown at us, we persevere, we stand united, we do not retreat in the face of danger and we should be grateful for our blessings. ""O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand/Between their loved home and the war\'s desolation,"" the author\'s infrequently heard fourth verse observes. ""Blest with vict\'ry and peace, may the Heav\'n rescued land/Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!""In an era when threats are far less certain than British ships on the Patapsco, such a message of determination and resolve still resonates exactly 200 years later. Such a nation can overcome terrorists, whether they come from Iraq or Syria or closer to home. It can stand up to dictators and despots. It can set a shining example of freedom and democracy to the world. This is the inspiring message of the anthem, and it ought to be forever remembered not only by the citizens of Baltimore but by an entire country, and with great pride.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldPriest at once defended, excoriated1969 slayings of 2 women forge police-FBI liaisonA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

The Orioles defeated the Yankees 3-2. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAs a nearly life-long Baltimore Orioles fan, I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually hate the New York Yankees. Yes, there are a few players here and there that are a bit distasteful, and a manager whose ego could only fit in NYC. And then there is the money spending thing that upsets the equilibrium of the game, although that activity may be catching up with the franchise at this point of history.As a baseball fan and purist, what I have always admired about the Yankees over the years \xe2\x80\x93 even as it was annoying in the extreme to watch \xe2\x80\x93 was the ability to come from behind at the end of a game. They did not always come back and win a game in which they were trailing, but they always put a guy or two on base and made a legit run at pulling it out. It was the Yankee way; they knew they were going to do it, and you knew it was going to happen also.

Even when they lose a game, you know they are going to do something in the last inning to threaten the other team.I\xe2\x80\x99m saying \xe2\x80\x9clast inning\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cninth inning.\xe2\x80\x9d On Friday afternoon it was the 11th inning. After a scoreless game until a Yankees solo home run in the top of the 11th, the Birds worked counts into getting the NY pitchers to load the bases for a two-out hit by Jimmy Paredes to win the game.And on Sunday night, it was consecutive doubles by Nelson Cruz, Steve Pearce, and Kelly Johnson that brought them back from the 2-1 deficit that had opened on them in the top of the inning by the Brian McCann homer.This is a \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s it going to be tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d sort of clubhouse, where anyone on the team can be the guy to make the difference in a game. And that is the character of a winning outfit. \xc2\xa0Imagine watching Endy Chavez and Wilson Betemit combining to beat the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the 9th inning!Imagine what watching Pearce and Johnson beat them must feel like for the Yankees! Johnson hit .219 for them in 77 games, and Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s average in NY was .160.\xc2\xa0 As an illustration, I think it would be like watching a rival team come to town and have Endy Chavez and Wilson Betemit engineer a come-from-behind victory over the O\xe2\x80\x99s.While singing the praises here of the offense in the ninth inning, it is still a bit scary that the Orioles only managed a total of 12 runs in four games and 37 innings against the Yankees. However, the O\xe2\x80\x99s were able to get three wins by holding the Yanks to a mere six runs in 38 innings of play. That is impressive, even though admittedly the NY offense is not that daunting right now.There is every reason with this Orioles team to stay in your seats at Camden Yards until the final out is registered. It is not like the old days where you might get a head start on the traffic by leaving after the eighth inning with the O\xe2\x80\x99s trailing.

Right now, his FIP is equal to last year\'s, but he\'s of course getting there differently, walking fewer while surrendering more home runs. Some of the more complex ERA estimators, such as xFIP (3.76) and SIERA (3.85), which factor in HR/FB% and ball-in-play types, respectively, suggest that his ERA isn\'t just lucky. Stroman began his rookie season in Toronto\'s bullpen before switching to starting full-time at the end of May. He started off well, with nine of his first eleven starts being ""quality"" ones, but then had a messy August, giving up five-plus runs in three of five games. His last start was a gem, though, as he shut out the Cubs for his second complete game, limiting them to three hits and striking out eight. Stroman throws lots of fastballs, roughly 40% four-seamers and 15% each sinkers and cutters to all batters. His curveball is his out pitch, again regardless of batter handedness, and he throws it 16% of the time. Lefties will also see changeups early in the count, while fellow righties will get the odd slider regardless of count. Tuesday, September 16, 7:05 ET: Ubaldo Jimenez vs. Drew Hutchison      Jimenez Hutchison   Stat 2013 YTD 2013 YTD   IP 182.2 114.1 - 169.1   ERA 3.30 4.96 - 4.36   FIP 3.43 4.81 - 3.78   AVG/OBP/SLG Against .239/.317/.367 .252/.360/.401 - .246/.307/.410         Jimenez will be making his first start since August 16, and he\'s only pitched twice since then. In a closer race, I\'d be questioning Buck\'s judgment here, but with a large division lead and little chance of passing the Angels for MLB\'s best record, there isn\'t much to lose in turning to Jimenez over McFarland, Brach, Saunders, or someone not currently on the active roster.    Hutchison\'s been on a bit of a roll lately, recording four straight quality starts, and giving up just five runs in those outings while striking out 32 in 25.1 IP. Of the Orioles with fifteen-plus plate appearances against him (Markakis, Jones, Hardy, and Cruz), all have a sub-.550 OPS. Hutchison throws 50% four-seam fastballs, but otherwise takes different approaches against lefties and righties. The former get about 20% each sinkers and changeups, plus about 10% sliders, mostly once Hutchison\'s already ahead in the count. Fellow righties see 35% sliders and 10% sinkers, with little variance depending on count. Maybe hot: Colby Rasmus (1.155 OPS, 29 PA) Likely not: Jose Bautista (.279 OPS, 26 PA) Wednesday, September 17, 7:05 ET: Bud Norris vs. J.A.

In the three starts before that, he twice gave up four runs in six innings to the Rays, but shut out the Reds for six in the other. Happ\'s most recent start was his best in a while, a one-run, seven-inning, seven-strikeout affair. Prior to that, he hovered around the line for quality starts for three outings, giving up ten runs over nineteen innings. Happ throws a lot of fastballs, using offspeed pitches just 12% of the time against fellow lefties and 23% of the time versus righties. He uses his four-seamer most often (51% vs. R, 63% vs. L), and his sinker and cutter another 25% of the time (lefties see an even mix, while righties get mostly sinkers). Righties get occasional changeups in all counts, and both get curevballs about 12% of the time, mostly as an out pitch.

Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s loss seemed devastating enough to finally do them in for good.Hiroki Kuroda pitched very well, and Brian McCann hit a ninth-inning home run to give the Yankees a late lead. But David Robertson, pitching for the third straight day, blew the save chance in the bottom of the ninth, and the Yankees lost, 3-2, to the Baltimore Orioles, their third loss in four games here.After the game, Robertson said he felt fine physically and refused to blame his performance on fatigue.\xe2\x80\x9cI just stunk,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not how I felt, it\xe2\x80\x99s how I pitched.\xe2\x80\x9dNelson Cruz led off the ninth with a double, and Steve Pearce followed with another double, scoring pinch-runner Quintin Berry to even the score. One out later, Kelly Johnson, an ex-Yankee, slapped a single into the gap in right-center field, igniting a hometown celebration for the first-place Orioles.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  It was a difficult result for the Yankees to sustain, especially as Kuroda once again pitched well enough to win, but once again it was not good enough.With a simple groundout to third base by Nick Hundley in the third inning, Kuroda recorded his 3,000th inning pitched, including games in Japan and the United States.That is not a statistic glorified in the record books, but it is representative of the solid work Kuroda, 40, has done both here and in Japan. Other pitchers have thrown more. Roger Clemens had more than 4,000 innings \xe2\x80\x94 all in Major League Baseball \xe2\x80\x94 while he was still 40, and Hideo Nomo recorded 3,0272/3, including 9761/3 in Japan.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Many of Kuroda\xe2\x80\x99s 3,000 innings looked a lot like the kind that he threw Sunday. He threw seven strong innings, allowed only one run and walked none, and did not get a win.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  He is used to that.Kuroda came into the game with a 78-79 record in 208 career starts and one relief appearance over four years with the Los Angeles Dodgers and three with the Yankees. His career earned run average of 3.47 would normally indicate a better won-loss record, but Kuroda has often suffered from lack of run support, going back to his days in Los Angeles.

Last year it was worse \xe2\x80\x94 just 3.2 per nine innings, which helps explain why he went 11-13, despite a 3.31 E.R.A.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Kuroda might best be described as talented, professional and determined as a pitcher. He has also been a hard-luck pitcher much of the time.Thirty of his 79 losses going into Sunday had come in so-called quality starts, where he allowed three or fewer runs in at least six innings. He has also lost out on 23 potential wins in games that were lost by the bullpen when he was in a position to win it. Four of those have come this year.On Sunday, Kuroda was pitching on a knife\xe2\x80\x99s edge throughout. The Yankees scored first on Martin Prado\xe2\x80\x99s second-inning home run, and Kuroda made it stand for four innings until the Orioles finally broke through. With one out, Alejandro De Aza singled to center and scored when the next batter, Adam Jones, ripped a double over the head of Prado at third base.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The ball was scorched, but it was on a trajectory to go foul. Prado jumped and deflected it with his glove, turning it into a fair ball. There was still only one out. With Jones on second base, Kuroda got the ever-dangerous Nelson Cruz to ground out to Prado at third, but Pearce reached on an infield single that sent Jones to third, 90 feet away from giving the Orioles the lead.

In the seventh inning, he set the Orioles down in order, giving him 3,0042/3 combined innings \xe2\x80\x94 1,3041/3 in the majors and 1,7001/3 in Japan.Before the game, the Orioles honored Derek Jeter, who spoke before the game about how much he liked Baltimore as a baseball town and how he had loved playing at Camden Yards for everything it contained, from the atmosphere to the playing surface. He also discussed his recent slump (he went 0 for 4 and is hitless in his last six games).\xe2\x80\x9cThe only result I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned about is us trying to win today,\xe2\x80\x9d he said before the game. \xe2\x80\x9cTrust me, I want to do probably better than most people every single time that I play. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the case. Good times, bad times, but you have to be able to forget it.

09/16/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles Win the American League East Championship', 'Sep 16, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles clinch the AL East championship after a game against the Toronto Blue Jays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles defeated the Jays 8-2. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are the American League East Division Champions. After thousands of articles written about the Baltimore Orioles over a period of years, I am finally able to write that glorious sentence!The O\xe2\x80\x99s took it to the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday night by defeating them 8-2, making Ubaldo Jimenez the unlikely winner of the clinching game in a season filled with unlikely heroes.Yes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe parade of the unlikely\xe2\x80\x9d continued at Oriole Park, with the indomitable Steve Pearce giving the Birds the lead with a three-run homer in the bottom of the first inning. Jimmy Paredes \xe2\x80\x93 having played most of the year in the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 farm system \xe2\x80\x93 added another run with an opposite-field solo shot. And the revived White Sox castoff Alejandro De Aza tripled home three runs in the seventh inning to drive a stake through the heart of the Jays and the AL East.When the Orioles win, as fans, we all share in it in some fractional way. Like me, I am sure that most of you are known in your families, communities, workplaces and associations as O\xe2\x80\x99s fans. You wear the gear; there is no doubt that it is a value to you. So when the team wins, you win.This website \xe2\x80\x93 The Baltimore Wire \xe2\x80\x93 is part of the FanSided Network. We write from the passionate perspective of the fans of our teams. So yes, when our team wins, we have a big part in the joy of the experience.It is right to celebrate, because it is very hard to win big things. As a much older-than-average Orioles blogger, let me give you a personal perspective.I like almost all sports, but I fell in love with baseball as a little boy in the 60s. By good luck, I was able to be in the stands for the fourth and final game of the 1966 World Series. It was an awesome experience for an 11-year-old.In my high school years, the Baltimore Orioles were the dominant team in baseball, winning the American League in 69, 70, and 71 \xe2\x80\xa6 along with the Series in 1970. I thought it would always be this way forever \xe2\x80\x93 the Orioles were clearly a dynasty.In my college years, the Orioles won a pair of AL East titles. But it was beginning to slip a bit. And then while I was in grad school in Texas, it was painful to watch the Pirates in 1979 beat them in the World Series.While I was busy building my first house and trying to get it done before winter, I took some time away to see the games in 1983 as they won their most recent Series.And then came the gaps\xe2\x80\xa6 14 years until 1997 \xe2\x80\x93 the most recent AL East championship \xe2\x80\xa6 and then the long 14 losing seasons until the wild card team of 2012. A full generation and more of Orioles fans have had little reason to be cheerful. For many of us, our children had no memory of a championship outfit.But a few years ago, I saw some young players who were intriguing; I liked what I was seeing, started a blog to write about it to anyone who would read it, later joined this network, and watched and wrote about more developments with the team. Adam Jones became the face of the organization with Nick Markakis as the foundation. The Orioles got a real manager who was a true baseball guy. Quality pieces were added from all over the world. The atmosphere had changed.Yes, here we are. We are a part of it. Celebrate in these days, for it is difficult to win. You cannot assume it will surely happen again soon.There is more work to do yet this year. The Orioles are one of 10 teams with a shot to win it all; it will be difficult. But it can be done.

He wasn\'t exactly a diamond in the rough late-round pick; Harvey was seen as a consensus late first-round pick and, without any four year college commitment, there were no signability concerns with him. Anyone could have had him. He wanted to play pro ball.    After mowing down Gulf Coast and New York-Penn League players for eight starts last year, Harvey got more attention on the prospect radar. One publication, Baseball Prospectus, rated him as the #58 prospect in all of baseball before this season. ESPN\'s Keith Law was even more aggressive in ranking Harvey,\xc2\xa0putting Harvey at #38 in his own list with the belief that Harvey could end up as a #1 or #2 starter, depending on the development of a changeup. Getting such a fast rising prospect at #22 overall is something most teams would dream about. The 2014 season was Harvey\'s first full season in professional ball. The 19-year-old Harvey spent the whole year pitching for the Low-A Delmarva Shorebirds. He was nearly three full years younger than the average player in that league. He did not look like it. Through 87.2 innings, he struck out 106 batters while holding up a 3.18 ERA. Harvey pitched so well that, in Law\'s midseason prospect ranking update, Law had moved Harvey up to\xc2\xa0the #13 prospect in all of baseball, with Law wondering why the Orioles had not moved Harvey up to Frederick or even Bowie. He believed that the South Atlantic League just couldn\'t challenge Harvey enough for him to develop that crucial changeup any further.    Unfortunately for Harvey and for the Orioles, he suffered an injury that became apparent during a start on July 25. He returned to Baltimore for an MRI that revealed what was alternately referred to as\xc2\xa0elbow inflammation and\xc2\xa0a flexor mass strain in his pitching arm. If they might have had any plans to challenge him at a higher level for the last month of the minor league season, they were scuttled by that injury.    The particular description of the flexor mass strain is something that will remain worrisome until Harvey is back and pitching and clearly healthy again. The injury suffered by Dylan Bundy that ultimately required Tommy John surgery was first diagnosed as\xc2\xa0flexor mass tightness. One key difference for Harvey is that he was not prescribed a platelet rich plasma injection; he was only told to rest and rehab the injury. That meant he was shut down for the rest of the minor league season from then on. It would be a huge disappointment if things go that direction with Harvey, but at least so far there\'s no indication that it will. That\'s just me being paranoid. I\'m going to stop being a downer.    Here\'s some video taken by Baseball America from a May 29 start against Wilmington: <object width=""425"" height=""350"" class=""mceItemFlash"">   <param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/mz7MO8Zyu3Y""></param>   <param name=""wmode"" value=""transparent""></param>   <embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/mz7MO8Zyu3Y"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent""     width=""425"" height=""350""></embed> </object> Hunter Harvey \xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore Orioles (via Baseball America)    Yeah, those are Low-A hitters, but look at him mowing down those guys. The curveball is a beautiful thing to see. These poor guys have no chance when he\'s getting that thing in there. It\'s the curveball that has created even more excitement about Harvey. In an August assessment of Harvey at fellow SB Nation blog Minor League Ball, Harvey has gone from ""a chance to have a Major League average curveball ... to discussion of whether Harvey\'s curveball is one of the better curveballs in the minor leagues."" After viewing Harvey in July,\xc2\xa0BPro\'s Tucker Blair pegged Harvey for a 2016 arrival in MLB, which would really be something. Blair liked, among other things, that Harvey has ""a quick delivery and works fast on the mound."" As Jim Palmer always says: Work fast, throw strikes, change speeds. Harvey has a chance to be able to do all of that. If he can develop a changeup the way that prospect evaluators seem to think he can, he\'ll be able to work with three speeds. When it comes to throwing strikes, Harvey has some more to work on that front at this point. He walked 33 batters in his 87.2 innings this year, which is on the higher end of what you\'d like to see, if not quite into Kevin Gregg or Ubaldo Jimenez territory. The minor leagues are there for learning, anyway.       It\'s always important to remember not to put too much stock in minor league numbers, good or bad. A player might look bad due to spending time working on a particular pitch during an outing. Good numbers could be due to accumulating gaudy stats against inferior competition. Still, it\'s not just the stat lines that are impressive for Harvey. People who make their livings evaluating prospects find much to be excited about with him. He was as high as #13 in Law\'s estimation at midseason. Perhaps he\'ll find himself just as high on next year\'s prospect list.    As long as he stays healthy, he should find himself starting out the season in Frederick and if he does well, maybe he\'ll end up the year in Bowie. Based on this year, the O\'s don\'t seem to be in a hurry to move him up, but Harvey seems like he is capable of forcing their hand.

That kept Boston, a longtime Oriole nemisis, out of the post season that year and prompted a wild Oriole celebration on the field at Oriole Park. Some people said that was a sign of futility in a team that had nothing else to celebrate other than keeping a team that they disliked out of the playoffs.

However the Orioles did the same thing with runners at the corners in the last of the first, and Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 swinging bunt scored Nick Markakis to tie the game. Nelson Cruz would ground into a double-play with Alejandro De Aza at third, giving the Orioles a 2-1 lead.Cruz would also add an RBI-single in the third inning to pad the lead to 3-1. Incidentally, that happened after Adam Jones very astutely took second base on a wild pitch. An inning later in the fourth Kelly Johnson would draw a leadoff walk, which was followed by a shot onto Eutaw St by Ryan Flaherty which might still be flying. The Orioles led 5-1, although that lead was cut to 5-2 in the top of the fifth on Danny Valencia\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single.Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Jose Reyes, who scored on the aforementioned Valencia RBI-single, felt that Caleb Joseph had illegally blocked the plate, even though he scored anyways. Thus in the last of the sixth when Joseph came up, Toronto starter Marcus Stroman threw behind Joseph, prompting a warning to both benches. First off, the run scored on the play at the plate earlier in the game; even if Joseph did block the plate, what exactly did Toronto want the call to be? An extra run? Secondly, Toronto also has to know that the Orioles are in no position to retaliate given the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re about to clinch the AL East pennant. The last thing they can afford is to get someone hurt or suspended in a fight of some sort. Lastly, it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear to me why the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bench needed to be warned; their guy was thrown at, right? This incident will not be forgotten, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll be put on the back burner \xe2\x80\x93 until next year.So it\xe2\x80\x99s very simple now; the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 magic number to clinch the AL East pennant is down to one. So you can look at tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game against Toronto as an AL East title game in a sense. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if it\xe2\x80\x99s for all the marbles; the O\xe2\x80\x99s will clinch the division with their next win or the next Toronto loss. Of all people, Ubaldo Jimenez will get the start tonight in spot duty. While Jimenez hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been good down the stretch this year, he now has the opportunity to only need to be good for a few innings and to put the Birds in a position to win. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Drew Hutchinson, with game time set for just after 7 PM.\xe2\x80\xa6and bearing all of this in mind the Orioles now get set to play perhaps the biggest baseball game in the history of western civilization \xe2\x80\x93Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sportsfor this year anyways. At the time of that dramatic comeback (which I termed\xc2\xa0the greatest closing act of all time) against Boston in 2011, my personal opinion was that it was a moment that could possibly elevate the franchise\xe2\x80\x99s level of play moving forward. Little did I or anyone else know that it was simply the first in a series of steps that have brought us to this moment in time. The following year (2012) was about as special as they come, what could lie ahead in the immediate future has the potential to be earth-shattering.That one game taught the core group of Orioles that\xe2\x80\x99s still together to this day that they could compete with the likes of the Bostons and NY\xe2\x80\x99s of the world. More importantly, it put the Orioles on a path. That path has had it\xe2\x80\x99s share of twists and turns, highs and lows, and a few surprises. But it\xe2\x80\x99s been a road worth traveling, and one that\xe2\x80\x99s been necessary in order so that this once great franchise could return to it\xe2\x80\x99s past glory and take up the title of\xc2\xa0CHAMPIONS\xc2\xa0once again.And ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s a road that\xe2\x80\x99s not yet fully traversed. The Orioles find themselves one win from being AL East Champions for the first time since 1997 \xe2\x80\x93 when I was a junior in high school! Thus they find themselves not quite at the end of the line, but at the crossroads of destiny. And while the events of September, 2011 might well have set in motion the events that led to this point, the Orioles arrive at this crossroads of destiny after a long journey of 17 years. Bearing that in mind, remember that many roads have tolls. And what might the toll be to use the long road the Orioles have traveled?\xe2\x80\xa6One Buck. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Mitchell Layton/Getty Images/AFP (AFP Photo/Mitchell Layton)More- After 17 years, the Baltimore Orioles are back on top of Major League Baseball's American League East division.Steve Pearce and Jimmy Paredes both homered to help the Orioles beat the Toronto Blue Jays 8-2 on Tuesday and clinch the AL East division crown for the first time since 1997.Baltimore's Ubaldo Jimenez overcame a shaky start and pitched five innings, allowing two runs on two hits with four walks and six strikeouts.While the Orioles won at home, the Washington Nationals secured the National League East division title in hostile territory \xe2\x80\x93 at defending champions Atlanta.Ian Desmond hit a two-run homer and Tanner Roark pitched seven scoreless innings as the Nationals beat the reeling Braves 3-0.AFP "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Hearts of champions - Birds Watcher', 'I thought long and hard all night about the title of this piece today; I\xe2\x80\x99m still not sure that I got it right. But come to think of it, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure there are words that could do justice to what we witnessed last night. A team that had stepped up big all year did it one more time to get through to the end in order to be crowned as champions. AL East champions to be exact \xe2\x80\x93 there\xe2\x80\x99s still some work to be done this year. However to the Baltimore Orioles themselves as well as to the people of Baltimore, it was a moment a long time in the making.Many fans were flabergasted to hear that manager Buck Showalter was starting Ubaldo Jimenez in a potential title-clinching game. First off, it was pretty simple; the Baltimore Orioles needed a spot starter. However while Jimenez had struggled all season without a doubt, there had to be a reason why he was brought to Baltimore. And we saw that reason unfold last night. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 2 H, 2 R, 4 BB, 6 K.Make no mistake about the fact that Jimenez struggled in this start. But he probably struggled less than he had in many other starts over the course of the year. At various points it appeared he was not long for the game. But the heart of a champion is a relentless one, and Jimenez hung in there. As did Showalter when it came to sending Jimenez back out in the fifth.  As I told many people yesterday: as much of a struggle as this year\xe2\x80\x99s been for him, if he wins this one game he\xe2\x80\x99s a hero tomorrow. With Toronto already leading 1-0, Steve Pearce stepped to the plate in the last of the first with two runners already on. Not one to be dwarfed by the limelight, Pearce delivered a three-run homer to thrust the Orioles into the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, 3-1. Toronto would net one more run in the second on a Reyes RBI-single, however the Birds would get that run back in the last of the inning on Jimmy Paredes\xe2\x80\x98 solo homer.The score stood at 4-2 through several scoreless innings. However there was still an uneasy tension in the air, as a two-run lead isn\xe2\x80\x99t much in MLB these days. With the bases loaded in the last of the seventh, Alejandro De Aza smacked his third triple in a week \xe2\x80\x93 this one of the bases-clearing variety. That gave the Birds a 7-2 lead, and effectively ended the competitive portion of the game. Nick Hundley would add \xc2\xa0a sac fly-RBI in the eighth, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s cruised to their first AL East title in 17 years with an 8-2 victory.What unfolded after the final out is a moment that will probably rank up there as one of the top moments in Baltimore sports history.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWhere as most teams pile on each other on the field to celebrate a championship and then go into the clubhouse for a champagne/beer soaked party, the O\xe2\x80\x99s proceeded to bring those beverages back onto the field to celebrate with the city and the fans. I suppose when you haven\xe2\x80\x99t clinched anything at home since 1969 and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been AL East champions since 1997, you\xe2\x80\x99re afforded that opportunity!A few takeaways so to speak: Adam Jones pieing fans, players celebrating with their kids, Nick Markakis (the longest tenured Oriole) realizing that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to the promised land for the first time in his career, and the Orioles fans getting to witness a moment so many years in the making. I suppose that the scene of the night would have to be Adam Jones running around the field with the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 champions flag gesturing towards the fans.As often as we see athletes engaging in so many ill activities (and of late no doubt), this Oriole team is a feel-good story. They\xe2\x80\x99ve re-captured the hearts and minds of Baltimore along with perhaps a few other folks nationwide. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve done so with the heart of a champion. Through so many losing seasons and embarrassing moments, this town and this franchise survived. So you can look at the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 story as perhaps synonymous with that of the city of Baltimore itself. They\xe2\x80\x99re a tough blue collar team that\xe2\x80\x99s managed to survive, and is now poised to go onwards and upwards. None of us knows where that journey ends \xe2\x80\x93 yet. However one thing is certain; it won\xe2\x80\x99t be in this month.The one thing that marred an otherwise unbelievable evening was the continuation of theatrics from Toronto pitchers. Nick Markakis was hit square in the back by Aaron Loup in the seventh inning (he was one of the runs that scored on De Aza\xe2\x80\x99s triple). It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear why Toronto seemingly has a problem with the Orioles, or even if they do at all. Keep in mind that Toronto is the team that the Orioles eliminated last night to take up their mantle of champions. So if that\xe2\x80\x99s their way of not going quietly into the night, they might want to take a look in the mirror and ask themselves what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing. Having said that, enough finally became enough in the eighth when Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day hit Jose Bautista, and both benches were warned.I would expect Buck Showalter to start giving some players games off with the division secured, and that may well start tonight. Piggybacking on what I just wrote above, the last thing the Orioles want is to have one of their regulars hurt if Toronto decides to start throwing at people again. Bud Norris will get the start tonight, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by J.A. Happ of Toronto; game time is just after 7 PM. Needless to say, the Orioles have played with the heart of champions all year. That moxie-filled celebration was well-deserved last night. Here\xe2\x80\x99s to the 2014 Baltimore Orioles, who after so many years finally \xe2\x80\x9cBucked the trend!\xe2\x80\x9d ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles call up Christian Walker from Norfolk - Camden Chat', "" Christian Walker is going to arrive in Baltimore a day late for the division title celebration, but he probably won't mind once he gets to make his big league debut. The Orioles have recalled their fourth round pick from 2012 to the major league club for the final stretch of games this season.    The 23-year-old Walker, selected out of the University of South Carolina, was named the Orioles' Brooks Robinson Minor League Player of the Year for 2014 in only his second full professional season. Between Bowie and Norfolk this season, the right-handed hitting Walker batted .288/.357/.489, although his numbers were much higher in Bowie (Double-A) than Norfolk. He led all Orioles minor leaguers with 26 home runs. Why Walker, why now? Since Walker was such a recent draftee, there was not any need to add him to the 40-man roster in this upcoming offseason. It probably has something to do with not wanting to force Steve Pearce to start every game at first base for the rest of the season with Chris Davis on the suspended list. The Orioles had an open 40-man spot, and they thought that adding Walker would bring something to the team they don't have right now. As fate would have it, Pearce is also a former South Carolina Gamecock; he was selected from there by the Pirates in the eighth round of the 2005 draft.    After watching the Orioles celebrate the division title last night, there's little reason to doubt the plans of Dan Duquette. The question about Walker is largely about whether he'll be able to hit for enough power to be a first baseman in the major leagues. The O's can start to get a little idea about how much to figure him in their long-term plans by giving him some playing time with the post-clinched Orioles this season, so that's exactly what they are doing. Walker will wear #18 for the Orioles.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles Lock Up A.L. East Title; Nationals Win N.L.

09/18/2014,"[('Orioles call up Christian Walker - Yahoo', 'Baltimore plans on auditioning the 23-year-old slugger over the final 11 games of the season.With Chris Davis\xc2\xa0now gone for the remainder of the season, the Baltimore Orioles have decided to call up first base prospect Christian Walker from Triple-A.\xc2\xa0As Roch Kubatko of MASNsports.com notes, Walker\'s promotion will enable the Orioles to give Steve Pearce some much-needed rest for the postseason.The loss of Davis has severely crippled the Orioles\' corner infield depth, and with the AL East division title already wrapped up, there is little risk in bringing up Walker to give Pearce some time off and see if he can hold his own at the highest level. The Orioles were in a similar situation last year, calling up Jonathan Schoop for a trial run in September. Surprisingly, Schoop made the Opening Day roster this season, and has been with the club ever since. The one questionable part of Walker\'s call-up is that he doesn\'t need to be placed on the 40-man roster until next year, though Davis\'s extension opens up a spot on the 40-man, so the Orioles don\'t have to risk losing anyone by adding Walker.The Orioles\' fourth round pick in the 2012 draft, Walker was rated by\xc2\xa0Baseball America as Baltimore\'s 18th best prospect entering the year. Scouts noted his gap-to-gap power but suggested the didn\'t have ""the power associated with the first-base profile.""

The move could just be the team rewarding Walker for an outstanding season. However, with slugger Chris Davis being suspended and lacking production for much of the season, the Orioles could be using the last two weeks of the season to showcase his future replacement. It would have been impossible to imagine after finishing 2013 with 53 homeruns that less than a season later his job could be in jeopardy, but his performance in 2014 has made it a conversation. Most Orioles fans are well aware of the numbers, and they are ugly to say the least. His .196 average is worst in the league and his 173 strikeouts are most in the league. Anyone would live with the strikeouts when you\xe2\x80\x99re hitting 53 homers and hitting .286 like he did in 2013, but not with his numbers this season. In Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 defense he has now missed games three times this season; once for an oblique injury, once for the birth of his son and now his amphetamines suspension. All together he was only available to play in 126 games. In his abbreviated season he did hit 26 homeruns and drove in 72 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s. So it would be hard to argue he had no production, but the Ks and average are a lot to overlook.Christian Walker on the other hand had an incredible year in the minors hitting 26 homeruns and driving in 96. There is no doubt with those numbers Walker can hit at the minor league level, but as baseball fans know that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always translate to the majors. Some people may have forgotten, but Lou Montanez once won the triple-crown in AA and Matt Wieters hit .355 in his only full season in the minors. Davis also has competition with the emergence of veteran Steve Pearce. The former utility man is now batting .297 and has hit 20 homeruns in only 97 games. The league has seen many players have successful seasons only to be unable to repeat them the following season, and that could easily be the case with Pearce. However, it is impossible to imagine watching everyday this season. Now with the acquisition of left-fielder Alejando De Aza, Pearce maybe limited to only first base. This season could just be an aberration and Davis could resemble the 2013 version of Chris Davis next season. However, with the emergence of Steve Pearce and prospect Christian Walker knocking on the door, Davis will have to show something special in spring training or his days in Baltimore could be numbered.  ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Tigers vs Royals: Who should the Orioles root for?', "" Now that the Orioles have clinched the AL East and secured a spot in the ALDS, the question remains about the opponent they would face. At this point, the O's are three games behind the Angels for the best record in the league. Assuming, the O's do not leapfrog the Angels, they will face the winner of the AL Central, which remains a close race with the Tigers leading the Royals by 1.5 games.\xc2\xa0 Who should the Orioles root for in the final two weeks of the regular season to become their opponent in the ALDS?    Rotation The Tigers have perhaps the most dominant rotation in all of baseball, with only the Nationals and the A's coming close in my mind. When Justin Verlander might be the odd man out of the rotation in the playoffs, you know that your rotation is in very good shape. That might indeed be the case, as the foursome of David Price, Max Scherzer, Anibal Sanchez and Rick Porcello have outpitched Verlander significantly this season, though Sanchez's injury has clouded the situation. On the other hand, the Royals' rotation is similar the O's in a lot of ways, consisting of roughly league-average starters at all spots. There is not much difference among Yordano Ventura, Jason Vargas and Danny Duffy, the likely starters for the second, third and fourth games of the ALDS if they can line up their rotation. The key difference between the O's and the Royals is that the Royals have a legitimate front-line starter in James Shields. Against the Tigers, the O's would face a lopsided pitching matchup in every game of the series. Against the Royals, Shields is the only opponent the O's would be worried about. Advantage Tigers. Bullpen The strength of the Royals' pitching staff lies in its bullpen. Their top relievers in terms of innings pitched, Wade Davis, Kelvin Herrera and Greg Holland, have an average ERA of 1.31 and an average FIP of 1.96. The bullpen collectively has an ERA of 3.39 that only ranks 12th in the league, but that is still miles ahead of the Tigers which ranks 27th in the league in terms of bullpen ERA with 4.23. The Tigers have struggled to find a consistent reliever all year, with Joe Nathan floundering in the closer role with a 5.10 ERA. The other top relievers in terms of innings pitched include Joba Chamberlain with a 3.64 ERA, Phil Coke with a 3.70 ERA and Al Alburquerque with a 2.53 ERA. Against the Tigers, there is a much higher chance of coming back from behind, and that is necessary given the rotation of the Tigers. Advantage Royals. Lineup The Tigers have the fourth best lineup in the league in terms of wRC+ at 112. This comes amid a down season from Miguel Cabrera Among the eight position players with the most PA (the ninth being Austin Jackson who has been traded for Price), only Nick Castellanos has a wRC+ lower than 100 at 98. Victor Martinez has been the third best hitter in baseball by wRC+ at 163, behind Mike Trout and Jose Abreu. Miguel Cabrera, even in a down season, ranks 12th in wRC+ at 146 among qualified hitters. JD Martinez has been an even better hitter than Cabrera this season with a wRC+ of 156. Meanwhile, the Royals rank 23rd in wRC+ at 92. Among the nine position players with the most PA, only Alex Gordon and Lorenzo Cain have wRC+ above the league average of 100. The Royals are a singles-hitting machine, having the second-most singles in the league behind only the Tigers. Unlike the Tigers which also possess plenty of power, the Royals have the lowest ISO in the league, coupled with the lowest walk rate and the lowest strikeout rate (I know, it's hard to imagine a team walking less the O's). Singles are just not that threatening, and the Tigers' power is much more worrying.    Advantage Tigers. Defense The Royals rank third in the league in UZR behind the O's and the Red Sox. They rank 7th in DRS (the O's rank second behind the Cardinals). Meanwhile, the Tigers rank 28th in UZR and 29th in DRS. This point doesn't need further elaboration. Advantage Royals.   Overall, the Royals seem like a very similar team to the O's. Both teams rely on their superior bullpen and defense to support their average-ish rotation. The O's have a better lineup, which is why they have won nine more games than the Royals. The Tigers have superior talent and the shinier names, but the Royals make up for their deficit by employing a dynamite bullpen and one the best defenses. Nevertheless, talent wins out majority of the time, and the pitching advantage the Tigers have over the O's would be especially difficult to overcome. I will be rooting hard for the Royals for the rest of the regular season, so the O's can have an easier road to the World Series.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsNow that the Baltimore Orioles have clinched the AL East, I thought I would take a few minutes before the final home series with the Red Sox begins to look back at predictions about the Orioles and the division from all the experts just before the beginning of the season.Here are the current records \xe2\x80\xa6Baltimore\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 92-60New York\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 78-74Toronto\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 77-75Tampa Bay\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 74-79Boston\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 66-87Most baseball writers at the end of March this year did not really give the Orioles much of a shot beyond maybe \xe2\x80\xa6 just maybe \xe2\x80\xa6 being a challenger. I wrote at the time that this was rather curious relative to the last several years, the powerful season of 2013 by Chris Davis and others, the historic team defense, and especially the free agent acquisitions from late in the offseason.But I suppose it is difficult for national writers to move away from being enthralled with the ever-present force of the Yankees, the aberration that was the 2013 Red Sox, and the pitching of Tampa Bay. But, in their world, Toronto is as easy to trash as the O\xe2\x80\x99s are.Looking back, I am proud to report that of all the \xe2\x80\x9cexperts\xe2\x80\x9d I put in my preseason article, I was the closest and most accurate. While on one hand I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised at that, it is really nothing too great to be so proud of \xe2\x80\xa6 for several reasons.I actually picked the Orioles to finish second behind the Rays who would win 95 games, with the Orioles winning 92. So, if the Birds finish the season 0-10, I will have been perfectly correct.Nobody making predictions could have foreseen the numbers of injuries that befell so many teams, including the Orioles, though Tampa Bay may have been hit by them the worst. While the Blue Jays turned out to be better than the improved basement team I predicted, I was correct about the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 age and suspect infield catching up to them and that the Red Sox simply had an experience in 2013 where a collection of players had a career year at the same time. I did not see them falling all of the way into the basement, but, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wear the shame of that with a smile.The writer who was closest to my predictions was Steve Melewski of MASN.

The Birds would go onto defeat the Seattle Mariners in the ALDS, but lose to the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS. However most fans probably felt that the franchise was in a good place in terms of winning moving forward. The likes of Rafael Palmeiro, BJ Surhoff, Brady Anderson, Roberto Alomar, and of course the great Cal Ripken Jr. were all still in place moving forward. However one day after being named AL Manager of the Year, Davey Johnson resigned as the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 skipper, which began a series of events that would haunt the Orioles for years to come.Whether it was PED accusations, free agent money not spent, free agents who turned into busts, injuries, poor coaching decisions, or anything else, the O\xe2\x80\x99s flailed in the wind for a long time \xe2\x80\x93 too long for some. Owner Peter Angelos of course opened the purse strings for slugger Albert Belle, however he retired after two seasons due to injuries. However the Orioles kept him on the roster for three seasons so as to collect insurance on his contract, and at a certain point they became hesitant to go after free agents due to that experience. The likes of Palmeiro went away and returned, only to embarrass the franchise with a PED suspension (which to this day has never been explained from Palmeiro\xe2\x80\x99s side).Cal Ripken Jr. ended his consecutive games\xe2\x80\x99 streak in 1998, and he retired after the 2001 season. That\xe2\x80\x99s when it seemed the mass exodus of fans began, as there was no superstar or big name to pay to see. Subsequently you had the likes of Sidney Ponson being knighted in his native Aruba, and then arrested on several occasions (once in Baltimore). There were times that it seemed that the franchise could do nothing right, including normal personnel moves. The likes of Lee Mazzilli, Sam Perlozzo, and Dave Trembley came and went. Heck, Mazzilli had a first place team in June and July of 2005, only to be out of a job by the end of August. Tough times had fallen on the yard, and yet it seemed that the Warehouse was above the cries of pain from their most loyal of supporters.Perhaps the most poignant aspect of those days were the consistent takeovers of Oriole Park by NY and Boston fans. It often seemed that those two franchises\xe2\x80\x99 success was directly tied to nadir after nadir for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. When either of those franchises would come to town, their fans would come with them. There were stories of fans waiting anxiously by the phones for the specified day and time for Oriole tickets to go on sale so that they could buy up series\xe2\x80\x99 worth of tickets to see their team play on the road in Baltimore. Because ultimately a trip to Camden Yards complete with food, travel expenses, and game tickets had better value than seeing their team play at Yankee Stadium or Fenway Park. Go figure that.The \xe2\x80\x9cHouse that Jeter Built\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFenway South\xe2\x80\x9d shirts that were sold over time became staples at Oriole Park. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 team store on Eutaw St had to resort to selling Boston/NY caps and shirts so as to have the opportunity to make a buck during those series\xe2\x80\x99. In my view the absolute worst moment was in May of 2008 when Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Manny Ramirez hit his 500th career home run at Camden Yards on a Saturday night. The place went absolutely nuts, and to add insult to injury the giddy Ramirez was all too happy to take a curtain call \xe2\x80\x9cfor his fans\xe2\x80\x9d in a visiting ballpark.In 2007 however things began to change. Owner Peter Angelos hired Andy McPhail midway through the season, and as we all know he put into place a core that we see on the team today. His most celebrated move of course was the trade that sent Erik Bedard to Seattle in exchange for Adam Jones, Chris Tillman, and George Sherrill. However also keep in mind that he drafted the likes of Matt Wieters and Manny Machado, all while bringing in the likes of J.J. Hardy, Chris Davis, and others. McPhail would relieve manager Dave Trembley of his duties in June of 2010, and by August of that year there was a new sheriff in town: Buck Showalter.Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAnd we all know the story from there; the 2011 Orioles completed a somewhat disappointing season with the greatest closing act of all time, the upstart 2012 team returned to the playoffs for the first time in 14 years, and just the other night the 2014 Baltimore Orioles won the AL East title \xe2\x80\x93 by beating Toronto. So it\xe2\x80\x99s been a long and curvy road with many toils and snares to get to this point in time, and thus a long time coming for this city, these fans, and this franchise. However while the journey of the 2014 Orioles is far from over, the \xe2\x80\x9clong road home\xe2\x80\x9d has been traversed.And that journey came to an end in a sense with the celebration we saw on the field on Tuesday.

""Considering how many RBIs and how many home runs he has contributed this year, who knows where we\'d be without him?""Ortiz also moved into a second-place tie with Jim Rice for 100-RBI seasons with Boston, one behind Williams, who had nine.""It\'s a big compliment to be mentioned with him. It\'s something I have done with a lot of consistency and hard work,"" Ortiz said. ""I have to come in and do my best every day regardless of how the team is playing.""This is one of those years in which the Red Sox are faring poorly, despite Ortiz\'s impressive numbers.""It\'s too bad that we have had the kind of season where we aren\'t in it,"" said Ortiz, who moved into a tie with Dave Winfield for 33rd on the career home run list with 465.In the race for best record in the AL, Baltimore fell three games behind the Los Angeles Angels, who faced Texas later Friday night.The most prominent starter in the lineup was Nelson Cruz, who had three hits, as did Alejandro De Aza.Junichi Tazawa (4-3) worked the ninth and Edward Mujica got three outs to secure his seventh save and end Boston\'s five-game losing streak against Baltimore.Down 3-1 in the seventh, the Orioles used a two-out double by De Aza, a pinch-hit triple by Delmon Young, and a throwing error by shortstop Xander Bogaerts to tie it.Young is 10 for 20 as a pinch hitter this season.TRAINER\'S ROOMRed Sox: It will take some time before INF Brock Holt (concussion) is ready to return.

The O\xe2\x80\x99s had chances to pull even but could not get the critical hit.The home season of 2014 began and ended with the visiting Boston Red Sox. Nelson Cruz set the tone on opening day for what would be his \xe2\x80\x9cMost Valuable Oriole\xe2\x80\x9d season by powering the Birds to a 2-1 win back on March 31st.When it was all said and done, the Baltimore Orioles would go on to win 49 more games at Camden Yards, posting a final record of 50-31. What is impressive about this\xe2\x80\x94beyond winning at a .617 pace\xe2\x80\x94is that most of those wins came later in the season.On June 22, after the Orioles finished off a road trip with an 8-0 win over the Yankees, their overall record was 39-35. However, the home record at that point was only 16-17. So from that point forward, the Baltimore Orioles were 34-14 at the Yard \xe2\x80\xa6 very impressive.So the final seven games of the season will be on the road \xe2\x80\x93 four at New York and three in Toronto. If somehow the Orioles could win all seven, they would finish with identical 50-31 records at home and away. Why not be greedy?

That's probably because it didn't matter. Sunday afternoon, the first place O's lost to the last place Red Sox in a game that didn't matter. They still almost won, only losing 3-2. All that matters now is everyone being healthy for the postseason.    Of course, they're all professionals and they always want to win, but it doesn't do much good if they hit the postseason and no one has anything left in the tank. Nick Markakis was out of the starting lineup for a fourth straight game with shoulder pain resulting from being hit by a pitch in the Toronto series. Steve Pearce sat for a second straight game with right wrist soreness that may have occurred when he tumbled into an awkward slide on Friday night. Adam Jones started out on the bench. These are luxuries you can take when you've got 93 wins and a division title already clinched even though there's seven games left to play. It wasn't much of a show for the 38,329 fans who came out for the regular season home finale, but even the fans know it's not the end. This is just the second time in Camden Yards history where the Orioles have finished their home schedule knowing the playoffs will still be coming to Baltimore. The Sunday crowd took the O's season total to 2,464,473, their highest draw since the 2005 season. That was over only 80 dates due to rain compressing two Pirates games into a single admission doubleheader.    As for the game itself, the word ennui comes to mind. I wouldn't say it was lazy, because there were not any plays by either team that seemed to be the result of laziness. But it wasn't full throttle either. It had the feel of spring training - lots of reserves, not much difference whether they won or lost. It was a different sort of meaningless game than we've gotten used to in September.    O's starter Miguel Gonzalez got the game underway by allowing a leadoff home run to Sox second baseman Mookie Betts, the first leadoff homer of his career. That was also the fifth leadoff home run that Gonzalez has allowed in 26 starts. That set the tone for the day. Gonzalez labored through that first inning, also allowing two men on base with singles before getting Rusney Castillo to ground out and end the inning. That set up the Sox with a 1-0 lead. They held on to the lead for the rest of the game. The Orioles offense did a whole lot of not much for the first five innings. The most exciting thing about those early innings was Delmon Young beating out an infield single in the first and then stealing second base. You should all be embarrassed for allowing that to happen, Boston. Sox catcher David Ross looked like someone ran over his dog after Young was called safe. After that, the O's went down 1-2-3 in three of the next four innings. Snooze button.    Another Red Sox run came across in the fifth inning courtesy of a Yoenis Cespedes single with two men on base. They added their third and final run with two outs in the sixth inning as Orioles manager Buck Showalter tried to get a six inning start out of Gonzalez. It didn't work; he gave up a home run to Ross on an 0-1 count and was lifted from the game, one out short of his seventh straight quality start. Over his 5.2 innings, Gonzalez gave up three runs on eight hits and two walks. He struck out seven but allowed two home runs. Not a great day, and certainly not the kind of day you'd want to see from him against a team in the playoffs. Victor Martinez and Miguel Cabrera loom. For the O's hitters, the sixth inning was the only scoring inning. Alejandro De Aza led off with a walk and scored from first on a double hit by #2 batter David Lough. A deep fly ball to center by Young moved up Lough to third, where he was able to score on a groundout by newly-minted Most Valuable Oriole Nelson Cruz, his 106th RBI for the season.    Two-out rallies in the eighth and ninth amounted to nothing. Young and Cruz had seeing eye singles in the eighth, but both were stranded when J.J. Hardy struck out. In the ninth, pinch hitter Steve Clevenger was left hanging by pinch hitter Kelly Johnson to end the game. You're not going to win many games where the other team gets twice as many hits as you. There were good moments, there were a couple of clutch hits, but mostly they got few chances and that's not going to cut it. Joe Kelly has been good for Boston - we may yet curse the Cardinals for being dumb enough to give up a breathing human being for John Lackey (4.50 ERA for STL). Maybe it was just the Orioles B-team in a game that didn't matter. Whatever the reason, they lost the home finale, and it doesn't much matter, because the postseason is coming to Camden Yards. Young had a good day in the losing effort, racking up two hits and one assist in the outfield. In the top of the seventh, Cespedes hit a line drive and brief-tenured Oriole Jemile Weeks kept running as if there were two outs. There was only one; Weeks was doubled up in embarrassing Casillan fashion. The Royals beat the Tigers on Sunday afternoon, keeping the Orioles seven games ahead of the Tigers for the #2 seed in the league with seven games to play. Any Orioles win or Tigers loss sews it up. They may yet face the Royals, who trail Detroit by 1.5 games.    Next up for the Orioles is a four game series against the Yankees in New York starting on Monday night.

For most of the season, the Orioles have carried 12 pitchers.

The first two are quite obvious: Chris Tillman and Wei-Yin Chen. I would guess that the competitive Bud Norris would be third and will pick Miguel Gonzalez as fourth.

He tallied a lot of additional years in all levels of the minor leagues, semi-professional ball, Marine Corps teams in WW2 \xe2\x80\xa6 actually, just about anywhere baseball was played.Boots might not have been remembered for much more than a good talent who caught fire for a couple of years, apart from being one of the most eccentric personalities imaginable. As Gisriel puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cBoots is baseball\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime leader in funny stories per innings pitched.\xe2\x80\x9dEveryone in the Williamsport area who is tuned into the local baseball history has heard of Poffenberger, and some of the old-timers in the area still remember him with a wide assortment of stories.But the primary source of information for Gisriel\xe2\x80\x99s book was a collection of scrapbooks put together by Boots\xe2\x80\x99 wife that contained just about every imaginable article and piece of memorabilia connected to the local legend. These were in the possession of Boots\xe2\x80\x99 grandson Jeremy Knode and were shared with Gisriel.In 1937 at age 21, after going 9-1 in 108 innings for the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 Texas League affiliate Beaumont, Poffenberger was called up to a Detroit team in dire need of pitching help. He made his debut on June 11th against the Boston Red Sox. He came into the game in the third inning and induced a double play, after which he pitched the rest of the game and gave up only one run on four hits. The Tigers came from behind and won the game 6-5. The losing pitcher? Lefty Grove. You may have heard of him.A month later on the 11th of July he pitched a complete game 3-2 victory over the Cleveland Indians, beating another pitcher you may recall named Bob Feller.By the end of his rookie season, Boots was 10-5, though with a 4.65 ERA in 137 innings. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re doing the math, that is 245 innings in a season where he turned age 22 in July. Yes, that was a different era.But as well as he was performing on the field, it was his activity away from the game that created the greater problems. He was very much a late-night party animal, to be found out at all hours of the evening, often in a bar. There were multiple occasions where he would simply disappear from the team without any notice. By modern-day standards, the Tigers were exceedingly patient with this and did all they could to seek successful ways of remedying the situation. But after two years, it was deemed unworkable.He was sent to Brooklyn, and in 1939, after only three games he jumped the team in Cincinnati, and\xc2\xa0was sent packing by the Dodgers. However, in 1940 he played a full season for their top affiliate at Nashville of the Southern Association, amassing a record of 26-9. But Boots never made it back to the big show; and of course the whole country was soon interrupted by WW2.from AustinGisriel.comAs just one of hundreds of examples in the book of Boots\xe2\x80\x99 eccentricities, he was at one point hired by the Wheaties cereal people to give a live statement one morning of what he was having for breakfast. He had been paid the evening before, and when the time came for his \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to DisneyWorld\xe2\x80\x9d type of statement that he was having Wheaties, he said \xe2\x80\x9ca beer and a steak!\xe2\x80\x9dProbably Boots Poffenberger needed a prescription for the same thing that has gotten\xc2\xa0Chris Davis into trouble \xe2\x80\x93 a strong dose of Adderall to control impulsive behaviors of ADHD.Author Austin Gisriel is a huge Orioles fan and has been, like me, following the Birds for close to 50 years. Actually, he lives in my neighborhood. I am not making this up or exaggerating a slight bit when I tell you that his basement family room is a Baltimore Orioles museum and shrine!The book \xe2\x80\x9cBoots Poffenberger: Hurler, Hero, Hell-Raiser\xe2\x80\x9d is a great read that is filled with the language and feel of a bygone era of baseball. It is simply a fun book, because Boots was a fun guy that everyone loved, and you will too. To get a paperback copy from Amazon for just $12.49, go to THIS LINK.

However, the hiring of Buck Showalter in 2010 and Dan Duquette in 2011 changed the face of Orioles baseball forever. Neither settled and both had a desire to bring a competitive baseball team back to Baltimore.They both wanted to bring back the pride of Orioles baseball and in the 60th season of the ball club\xe2\x80\x99s existence they did just that by winning the team\xe2\x80\x99s first AL East Division Title since 1997.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe sport of baseball has so many crazy niceties, people often lose track of them. Nevertheless, each facet of this game counts for something, and every player can contribute to his team\xe2\x80\x99s victory in a plethora of ways \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0from bunt hits to balks to balls off the wall. Baserunning is one of these elements, and many people simply don\xe2\x80\x99t consider it. That\xe2\x80\x99s a shame, because it can really add up. Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me? I\xe2\x80\x99ll prove it, via a sportswriter classic: the blind comparison.PlayerPAsAVGOBPSLGwOBAwRC+OffPlayer A93980.2810.3560.4910.362120295.0Player B94950.2790.3540.4870.362118146.3In their major-league careers, these men have remarkably similar hitting profiles, over essentially analogous amounts of time\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 and yet Player A has more than double the offensive value of Player B. The players are Carlos Beltran and Paul Konerko, respectively, and the discrepancy comes as the result of one thing: baserunning. Since debuting in 1998, Beltran has been worth 64 runs on the bases, which only four players can top; on the flipside, Konerko has cost his clubs 69 runs on the basepaths, the lowest in the majors since 1997\xc2\xa0(his rookie year). With equal performances when they step up to bat, this duo only separates once the at-bat has ended.Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s move to more Oriole-centric news. The Baltimore Orioles, in case you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard, will make the postseason! The position players, who have churned out the third-most value in baseball, should receive most of the credit for that; the best player of the group happens to have his name featured in the title of this post. Yes, Adam Jones has posted another superb season for the Birds, just as he did last year. In fact, since the beginning of 2013, his 9.5 WAR ranks 10th in the American League. Most of that has come from his offense, as he has accrued 38.2 Offensive runs \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa013th in the AL. However, his hitting, while decent, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t supply as much as you might expect: By wRC+, he\xe2\x80\x99s only the 24th-best hitter in the league.If Jones doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mash, how does he have so many runs to his name? You guessed it: baserunning. By Ultimate Base Running (or UBR, on which I\xe2\x80\x99ll elaborate in a moment), he has been 9.2 runs above average for these past two years, a hair behind Austin Jackson for third in the AL. This represents a huge step forward for him, since he only had 12.7 of those runs to his name before 2013. As Birds Watcher\xe2\x80\x99s Domenic Vadala noted prior to the season, Jones\xe2\x80\x99s recently-aggressive approach on the bases has served the Orioles well.Does Jones derive that success from blazing speed? Hardly: His Spd \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0a number that measures, well, speed\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 over that time sits at 4.6. As a point of reference, league-average is 4.4. Unsurprisingly, no one else in the top 10 for UBR has a Spd below 5, which means Jones\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments are pretty impressive. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t steal bases, with a meager 1.6 wSB in 2013 and 2014. No, his improvement stems from a finer craft, of underappreciated dashes and darts, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time they received their due.Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at UBR. What goes into it? According to Mitchel Lichtman, its creator, it incorporates several factors, including (but not limited to):Taking an extra base on a hit by another batter (e.g., going from first to third on a single, scoring from first on a double, etc.);Taking an extra base on a fly ball;Advancing on a ground ball hit by another batter (e.g., going from second to third on a grounder to shortstop, etc.); andNot getting thrown or tagged out while doing the above.So how has Jones fared in these regards? The statistical oasis known as Baseball-Reference can give us some answers. It has a tidy number for the first part: Extra-Base Taken rate, or XBT%. In 2013 and 2014, the MLB averages for those stood at 39% and 40%, respectively; Jones topped those by a healthy margin, with 43% and 52% figures, respectively. That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t caused his change, though, as he\xe2\x80\x99s put up better numbers in the past: From 2006 to 2012, he had a 50% XBT%.Moreover, Jones doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to have made significantly safer decisions in his baserunning, since he still makes outs at about the same rate. In the first seven years of his career, he got Out On the Bases (OOB) 23 times in 3118 plate appearances, whereas years eight and nine have seen those numbers change to 9 and 1362, respectively. Both numbers sit below the major-league-average marks, but the latter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t diverge notably.Thus, Jones\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite UBR comes from the second and third aforementioned parts of his game. He frequently seeks to take extra bases\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 he has 20 Bases Taken (BT) in the current campaign, to accompany 21 from the prior one. By contrast, he only had 59 in every season before those; plus, those came in almost two-and-a-half times as many trips to the dish. Paired with his out-avoiding ability, his uptick in aggression has even more value: Among the 33 MLB players with 20 BTs in 2014, for instance, a mere 10 others have run into as few as three outs. This combination doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come along all that often.Annoyingly, B-R doesn\xe2\x80\x99t break down TB further, so this is where my analysis will have to end. Luckily, though, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 season won\xe2\x80\x99t end for a while, and Jones will most likely play a large role in keeping it alive. He might do that by smacking a home run (or two), or by preventing someone else from doing the same. Or, he could support the team in a more subtle manner. If you watch more closely, the breadth of Jones\xe2\x80\x99s excellence might surprise you.All statistics courtesy of Baseball-Reference.

The Orioles defeated the Yankees 5-4. Mandatory Credit: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles registered a 5-4 win over the New York Yankees on Tuesday evening that contained a number of positives that should make O\xe2\x80\x99s fans feel a little bit better in this odd final week of the regular season. It is a strange time of kinda competing, while kinda resting and getting oriented and prepared for the playoffs to begin in another week.The Orioles pounded out a total of 17 hits, including 14 singles. So that is 17x more hits than they pounded out Monday night. If they can keep up that trend of 17x more hits each night, it would be 289 on Wednesday night and 4913 on Thursday evening \xe2\x80\xa6 just sayin\xe2\x80\x99. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get this sort of analysis just anywhere!Even so, with 17 hits, one would expect a few more runs than simply five; but the hits were very spread out over the game. The Orioles had baserunners in every inning. Four of the Orioles had 13 of the 17 hits, with Nick Markakis getting four, while Nelson Cruz, Kelly Johnson, and Nick Hundley had three hits each. This was the fifth game this season where Markakis has gotten four hits; and since he has been struggling a bit lately, it is good to see him come alive again. \xc2\xa0Nelson Cruz leads the AL in home runs by 3 with a total of 40Cruz hit his 40th home run, which puts him three homers ahead of Houston\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Carter for the AL lead. Markakis and Johnson also hit home runs.Also regarding Cruz, it has been great to see the way that he has hit to all fields of late and beaten the shifts on numerous occasions. He still hits home runs while doing this \xe2\x80\x93 which is what Chris Davis is somehow going to need to learn to do if he wants to be a top drawer offensive threat again.Hundley has been hitting well, while Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s bat has gone into a deep sleep. Though I think Joseph is the player with a future in Baltimore, it may be that Hundley should play something like two-thirds of the games in the playoffs. Over his past 10 games, Hundley is 8-for-31 with two home runs, and over his past 20 games he is 19-for-64 (.297) with three homers.Ubaldo Jimenez got his second consecutive win, and he will apparently get to start the final game of the season in Toronto \xe2\x80\x93 where much of the bullpen will get some final tune-up time in the game. That Jimenez can finish the season on a positive and contributory note may well be very significant for his winter and for next year. The Orioles are going to need this guy to put it back together and make the investment worthwhile.It was great to see Zach Britton come on and get the Yankees in the bottom of the ninth inning. Though giving up a high-chopping infield single, he come right back to strike out Derek Jeter. Britton had some nasty stuff going on.

He is a big guy (6\xe2\x80\x998\xe2\x80\x9d) with upper 90s fastballs and breaking stuff that varies in speeds greatly. He will likely be the Yankees closer for the next 12-14 years, and it is going to be a problem for everyone.But all in all, the Baltimore Orioles are working to get themselves set up for the playoffs run.

Over and over, while looking at the Yankees / Orioles series, Jeter would register five, six, or seven hits per series.It was a wonderful career by one who will always be remembered properly as among the very best.Actually, the Orioles had four home runs and still lost the game.

He\xe2\x80\x99s the franchise leader in games (2,744), hits (3,461 \xe2\x80\x93 sixth all-time), doubles (543) and stolen bases (358) while ranking second behind Babe Ruth in runs (1,922), sixth in RBIs (1,307) and ninth in home runs (260).

The Orioles are 2 1/2 games behind AL West champion Los Angeles for home-field advantage throughout the playoffs after the AL won the All-Star game. \xe2\x80\x9cNot everywhere you play in the postseason is going to be a friendly environment,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Buck Showalter said, \xe2\x80\x9cso it is good to have that kind of emotion going on (Thursday night) before you get there.\xe2\x80\x9d The Angels finish with three in Seattle, while Baltimore heads to Toronto for three. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got an outside shot of catching Anaheim,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t ever take some satisfaction out of eliminating a team.\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman is 3-1 with a 1.64 ERA in seven career games against the Yankees, going 1-0 with a 0.75 ERA in two starts this season. Kuroda is 3-3 with a 2.80 ERA in 11 starts against Baltimore, including one in the 2012 division series. The Orioles are looking to beat the Yankees 14 times in a season for the first time since going 15-3 in 1966.

With their mediocre record, it was almost impossible. But they felt that if any team could generate such an improbable run, it would be a team with him on it.Not even Jeter in his farewell season, though, could manufacture that much good fortune, and for the second straight year the Yankees failed to make the postseason. The outcome, long in coming, became official Wednesday when the Baltimore Orioles beat the Yankees, 9-5, at Yankee Stadium in front of an announced crowd of 46,056, which seemed to care more about each Jeter sighting than the final result.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all disappointed,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should be disappointed. We\xe2\x80\x99re sorry for the organization and all the fans because they\xe2\x80\x99ve come to expect us to be in the playoffs, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not this year.\xe2\x80\x9dThe last time the Yankees failed to make the playoffs in consecutive years was 1992 and 1993, the final years of a 12-season playoff drought. In 1994, the Yankees were in first place in the American League East when the season was ended by a strike, which lasted into 1995. That was the year Jeter joined the Yankees, and in 17 of his 20 seasons the Yankees advanced to the postseason, winning the World Series five times. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The loss also ensured that Joe Girardi would become the first Yankee manager since Buck Showalter in 1993 to fail to make the postseason in consecutive years. Showalter now manages the Orioles, who clinched the A.L. East last week and are one of the hottest teams in the major leagues.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Girardi also failed to make the playoffs in 2008, but he won the World Series in 2009.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing; it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work that goes into the course of the year for everyone involved, and this is not where you want to be this time of year. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so frustrating.\xe2\x80\x9dAt the time of their elimination, the Yankees had 81 wins with only four games to play. The Kansas City Royals and the Oakland Athletics both started the day with 86 wins, so there was no way the Yankees could catch either team for a wild-card spot.The main reason for their poor season was a lack of offense, which at times was compounded by substandard defense. The Yankees, who spent lavishly on free agents like Carlos Beltran, Brian McCann and Jacoby Ellsbury, entered Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game having scored 606 runs, which ranked 13th in the 15-team A.L. Players including Jeter, Mark Teixeira, Beltran and McCann did not play up to their standards.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Teixeira hit a home run Wednesday, but his batting average was .219. McCann leads the Yankees with 23 homers, but the first half of his season was dismal. Teixeira acknowledged that the second half of his season was \xe2\x80\x9cterrible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Jeter has struggled, too. He had a .324 on-base percentage in the first half of the season, but it dropped below .275 in the second half. At 40, he has shown a lack of range at shortstop. His overall on-base percentage of .301 is well below his career mark of .377 and well below the mark for a typical No. 2 hitter.

At times we struggled in other areas defensively. Pitching was pretty consistent. We went through a lot of injuries and had to use our bullpen a lot, and at times I think there was some fatigue there. It\xe2\x80\x99s everything involved.\xe2\x80\x9dJeter went 0 for 4 on Wednesday, breaking his seven-game hitting streak. After his final out, a weak tap to first base on a checked swing, he walked back to the dugout with his head down as the fans stood and cheered. They kept clapping, shouting and chanting his name in the hope that he would emerge from the dugout and make a curtain call. But Jeter explained later that it would have been awkward to do that while the Yankees were still trying to win a game that mattered.Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s game will not matter, except as a stage for Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s goodbye to New York. Weather permitting, he will play his last game in the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 home pinstripes, and it should be an emotional affair. But it will also be the only home game he has ever played when his team has already been eliminated from postseason contention. He played in one so-called meaningless game, on the road, in 2008.

Related Coverage           At Second Base, Stealing a Souvenir Moment With Derek Jeter SEPT. 24, 2014                       ', 'www.nytimes.com'), ('Yankees 6, Orioles 5: Jeter tweaks the Orioles one last ...', "" Anyone with a modicum of a sense of history appreciated the circumstances of the game tonight. Whether you're an Orioles fan, a Yankees fan, or a fan of neither, there's no way you could watch it without knowing what every pitch, every at-bat, every run, every throw meant to the vast vast majority of people who care about baseball. So it was only fitting that in the end, despite the Orioles' best effort to send The Captain away with an L, it was he who got the last laugh.    On offense at least, it was a classic 2014 Orioles game: Nick Markakis and Alejandro de Aza opened the game with back-to-back jacks off of Hiroki Kuroda, putting the Orioles in the driver's seat early. Then the bats went ice cold: after de Aza singled in the third, no one reached base until Nick Markakis walked in the top of the 9th. Then Adam Jones smacked a two-run shot over the wall in left, Nelson Cruz struck out, and Steve Pearce followed with a dinger of his own. These are your 2014 Orioles. That would've been enough to win the game, on paper at least. But the Orioles' defense, and to some extent the pitching, just wasn't up to the task. Kevin Gausman needed 35 pitches to get out of the first inning. The only solid hit he gave up was a double to, you guessed it, Derek Jeter. But since Brett Gardner had just singled, that double was enough to make the score 2-1. Then Jeter moved to third on a wild pitch in the dirt. He scored when Brian McCann reached first on an error by Kelly Johnson, who bobbled an easy grounder. That tied it at 2, and there the score remained until the wild seventh inning. T.J. McFarland struck out Stephen Drew but the ball bounced away from Caleb Joseph and Drew reached first easily. Ichiro Suzuki tried hard several times to bunt the runner over, but failed ... and ended up walking. Jose Pirela, called up just a few days ago, did bunt -- and got a perfect one down, making Joseph dive for it so his throw nearly escaped the reach of Steve Pearce.    Bases loaded, nobody out, tie game. Brett Gardner chopped a grounder to Pearce at first base. Pearce was running in and was able to scoop the ball up and fire home for the force-out. One down. Up next was ... yeah you guessed it, Jeter. The Yankee Stadium crowd was on its feet, chanting, hoping for a hit, a walk, something, anything. Buck Showalter brought in Ryan Webb to relieve.    What the fans got was an odd duck of a play. On an 0-1 pitch, Jeter swung hard at a sinker well inside, breaking the bat. I like to think that he was aiming at Jimmy Paredes, who'd shown a slight case of the yips in his throws to first bast earlier in the game. But the ball squibbed out towards J.J. Hardy at shortstop. He gathered it and tossed it to Johnson at second base to start the double play. Only it was a bad throw and Gardner had been off on contact and was sliding in hard. Johnson missed the ball and it rolled into right field, where Markakis was alertly backing up the play. Two runs scored, and Gardner ended up on third. He'd score one batter later on a sacrifice fly. Suddenly it was 5-2. The Captain had done it again with a ... broken-bat RBI and error by the Orioles normally sure-handed shortstop? Sure, why not. Let's give Jeter this one -- he out-clutched Hardy and, with his calm eyes and steady gaze, willed that ball into right field. Yes.    If that had been the game, fine. But it got even zanier than that. The score stayed at 5-2 until the top of the 9th. Joe Girardi brought in ace closer David Robertson, who may also have been in his final Yankee stadium game, given a) he's a free agent next year and b) what transpired while he was on the mound. Oh wait, I already told you. Walk, dinger, strikeout, dinger. Tie game at 5. It was such an Orioles comeback, to blast two home runs after being dominated by Kuroda all game. But you know why the Orioles tied the game, right? It was so that The Captain could have his final moment underneath the bright Bronx lights. And have it he did. In the bottom of the ninth, Buck brought in Evan Meek to keep the game where it was -- or to give his old protege a chance at superstardom, I can't be sure which. He also brought in Ryan Flaherty to play third base. Both moves would haunt him, or make him happy he could provide Jeter a scripted walk-off moment: whichever it is, I don't know. Anyway, Jose Pirela singled to start off the inning. The ball scooted underneath the glove of a diving (or rather, falling) Flaherty. Somebody named Antoan Richardson came in to pinch run. Gardner was up next, and he sacrificed RIchardson to second base. So now here we are (again): tie game, runner in scoring position, and Captain Clutch at the plate.    As I recollect, it was a hanging curveball. Floated right over the plate. You or I probably could have made solid contact with it. Jeter put all of his signature inside-out, opposite-field stroke into it. The ball shot into right-center field, Richardson raced around the bases to score, and that was it. Career (at Yankee Stadium, anyway) complete, legacy secure: Jeter had gone the opposite way for a walkoff RBI. And the scriptwriter got up from his chair, stretched his tense back muscles, yawned and rubbed his eyes sleepily, and let an easy grin tug at the corners of his mouth. He'd done a good night's work on this, his final masterpiece. I would like to do one last thing, and that is give Steve Pearce credit for some solid D tonight. At times he seemed like the only one paying attention out there. The 5'11, stocky first baseman had to jump and snare more than a few poor throws from other infielders. Those catches made sure the score wasn't absurd, as there were runners on base when he was doing his glovework. Tomorrow, the Orioles end the regular season with a three-game set at Toronto.

A season of ups and downs and historic moments, the Orioles have made the playoffs, played against future Hall of Famer Derek Jeter in his final game of his career, and most importantly suffer the loss of former Orioles executive, the late Frank Cashen. And as Baltimore clinches the AL East early, a big advantage they needed, let\xe2\x80\x99s look back at the man who arguably defined the Baltimore Orioles.Frank Cashen came into the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lives in 1965 as executive vice president of the team. A native of Baltimore, Cashen played second base at Loyola College before joining the Baltimore News-American where he spent 17 years as an award winning sportswriter. Cashen was a leading candidate for American League presidency and to replace then Commissioner Bowie Kuhn in 1975. Shocker, a sportswriter with a great mind for baseball also has a great mind for beer.Frank was seen as a shrewd business man. Many trade proposals came from his brillance. While in Baltimore, Frank Cashen orchestrated perhaps the greatest trade in the history of baseball when he acquired Hall of Fame hitter Frank Robinson in 1966. Truly a \xe2\x80\x9cHow the hell did he pull that off?\xe2\x80\x9d move, Robinson would go on to win the Triple Crown, three American League pennants from 1969 to 1971, and the 1970 World Series.After Harry Dalton left for the Los Angeles Angels, Cashen took over as General Manager for the rest of his tenure in Baltimore. He would eventually be led away by the New York Mets, but his impact helping shape the Orioles franchise still resonates in fans today. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injurySadly, the baseball world was shocked to learn Frank Cashen passed away June 30 at the age of 88.A man of integrity and passion with a penchant for bow ties, no one had a more diverse career than Frank Cashen. His greatest successes and most unsettling disappointments came from building a juggernaut of the Baltimore Orioles in the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s. I was tickled to learn Frank commonly said the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cAnother day in paradise,\xe2\x80\x9d a phrase I say at least once a day to a coworker.Orioles fans know exactly just how difficult it is to be a fan. Having not seen a World Series title since 1983 and a horrible string of seasons in the 90\xe2\x80\x99s, a Baltimore Orioles fan can sometimes be a life of heartache. The Baltimore Orioles are good this year. Really good. AL East champs and poised to make a deep playoff run, the Baltimore Orioles are in prime position to pay tribute to Frank Cashen. Who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love a great feel-good story? Let\xe2\x80\x99s win one for Frank, Baltimore.

Al Bello/Getty Images/AFP (AFP Photo/AL BELLO)More- Derek Jeter closed out his glorious career at Yankee Stadium in epic fashion, knocking in the game-winning run with a walk-off hit as New York slipped past the Baltimore Orioles 6-5 on Thursday.Jeter, 40, said so long to the delirious Bronx faithful as the Yankees' iconic captain wound down his 20-year Major League Baseball career with a perfect ending in his final game at home.With the scored tied 5-5 in the bottom of the ninth, the future Hall-of-Famer stepped up with a runner on second base and blasted an opposite field single through the gap between first and second base.Yankees' Antoan Richardson then slid into home for the winning run, touching off a wild celebration around Jeter.AFP "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Blue Jays - Camden Chat, a Baltimore Orioles community', "" The Orioles are north of the border for one final time this season as they begin the last series of the regular season. Just don't let anyone get hurt. It was explosive the last time these two teams got together. Baltimore has just three games to get through before they start playoff baseball. Namaste.

However, he did still manage to strikeout 11 Baltimore batters. Missing bats is something that Toronto's right hander does very well. Right now, he averages 8.8 strikeouts per nine innings pitched in 2014. I would expect that number to inch just a bit closer to nine after tonight.    On top of that, Hutchison does a better job of pitching at Rogers Centre rather than away for it. His ERA at home is 4.11 compared to 4.80 on the road.    RHP Chris Tillman, Baltimore 2014 stats: 13-5, 3.26 ERA, 201.1 IP, 178 H, 21 HR, 66 BB, 145 SO, .232 BAA, 1.21 WHIPLast start (vs. Boston): 7.0 IP, 5 H, 2 ER, 2 BB, 6 SO, WCareer against Toronto: 13 G, 4-5. 3.98 ERA, 83.2 IP, 77 H, 16 HR, 61 SO, 20 BB He is your starter for game one of the ALDS and for good reason. His ERA is a measly 2.55 in September and he has regained his ability to strike opponents out recently. In his last five starts he has thrown 29.2 innings and struck out 29 batters.    But Tilly doesn't do so well in Toronto. He is 2-3 in seven starts there with a 5.79 ERA over 42.0 innings pitched. The worst part is that he has given up 13 home runs in those innings. So, this may not be the best last impression we get from the righty. Good thing he will be pitching at Camden Yards next week. However... MASN's Roch Kubatko brought this tidbit to his readers attention\xc2\xa0earlier today in a blog post. As long as Tillman doesn't lose tonight, he will have the most road starts in a single season without a loss since 1914. It will tie him with Greg Maddux. Both men will have made 15 starts. Tillman is 8-0 on the road this year, Maddux went 13-0.

Tillman has already gotten to 200 innings pitched for the second consecutive season. MASN's own Jim Palmer has the Oriole record of 11 200 inning seasons in the black and orange.

put it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeter, who was uncharacteristically expressive after the game.It was a night when everything seemed to happen specifically to allow Jeter to be Jeter in front of his home fans for the last time. The rain stopped, the Orioles pushed the game to the bottom of the ninth by hitting two home runs, a Yankees runner got to second base, and Jeter came to the plate again with his name ringing in his ears. He then did exactly the kind of thing that had made him so adored by his fans.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees were leading, 5-2, heading into the ninth inning, but Adam Jones hit a two-run homer off Robertson, and Steve Pearce hit a bases-empty shot to tie the score. Jeter was at shortstop at the time, and he slumped his head momentarily. But on the bench, his teammates looked at the scoreboard and saw who was batting third in the bottom of the inning.

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORENEW YORK (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Two home runs to start the game, followed by a powerful comeback in the ninth inning. In the end, though, the Baltimore Orioles only wound up on the losing side of Derek Jeter\'s fairy-tale farewell at Yankee Stadium.Jeter capped his home finale with a game-winning single in the bottom of the ninth that gave New York a 6-5 victory Thursday night over the AL East champions, the latest \xe2\x80\x94 and perhaps last \xe2\x80\x94 storybook moment of his charmed and illustrious career.""Our guys, everybody has a lot of respect for Derek and what his career has been about. You never like to lose a game, but you try to keep a grip on reality,"" Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. ""We wish him well and I\'m sure it was a great moment for him here. And it will be a great moment for us as we go forward to continue to play.""The Orioles wasted four homers, committed three errors and fell three games behind the AL West champion Los Angeles Angels for home-field advantage throughout the postseason.Baltimore has three games left in Toronto, while the Angels visit Seattle for three. If the Angels and Orioles finish with the same record, Baltimore owns the tiebreaker.Serenaded with adoring chants that echoed through the Bronx night, Jeter tipped his cap several times and drove in three runs. He launched an early RBI double off the left-center wall against rookie Kevin Gausman and then saved the best for last, a sharp, opposite-field single to right that knocked in the winner and set off a raucous celebration.""I\'m more concerned right now that we gave them all those runs. We just didn\'t play very good defense tonight,"" Showalter said. ""We understand what\'s going on with the emotion in the ballpark. Hopefully, it\'s a good preparation for what\'s ahead of us in some ballparks. But the guys handled themselves well.""It appeared Jeter\'s tiebreaking grounder in the seventh would be the swing that sent the Yankees to a win when they built a 5-2 cushion.Not bad \xe2\x80\x94 but not Jeter.Nope, he\'s always had a flair for the most electrifying kind of drama, and this night was no different.As if it was planned all along, Yankees closer David Robertson (4-5) gave up a two-run homer in the top of the ninth to Adam Jones and a tying shot to Steve Pearce with two outs.That only set the stage for Jeter one more time.""Destiny has a way of working things out,"" Orioles reliever Evan Meek said.""It\'s like something out of a book,"" Gausman said.Jose Pirela hit a leadoff single against Meek (0-4) before Brett Gardner sacrificed. Jeter lined the next pitch through a huge hole on the right side, and pinch-runner Antoan Richardson slid home ahead of Nick Markakis\' throw.""Being on the mound in that situation, you have to take yourself out of the moment and focus. I looked in and said, \'Let\'s do this.\' I threw him a cutter away, and that was it,"" Meek said. ""I could be upset about it, but you\'re better off just understanding how important a day it was for baseball, for him. Obviously, you don\'t want to be the guy that gave up the game.""An elated Jeter jumped and raised both arms between first and second. Yankees players rushed out to engulf him as former teammates such as Jorge Posada, Mariano Rivera, Bernie Williams, Andy Pettitte, Tino Martinez and Hall of Fame manager Joe Torre lined up near the New York dugout waiting to greet the retiring captain.""Sort of an out-of-body experience,"" Jeter said.In one twist that hardly fit, Jeter\'s home finale was the only game he ever played at Yankee Stadium with his team already knocked out of the playoff race.""His signature is winning. What other accolade can you pick?"" said Showalter, who was Jeter\'s first manager when the youngster broke into the big leagues in May 1995. ""Take a good look, because there are not going to be many like this come your way again.""Heavy rain soaked the city all afternoon, but the game began right on time and the Orioles got off to a rollicking start.Roll call by the Bleacher Creatures was interrupted just as they got to a roaring chant of ""De-rek Je-ter!"" Markakis hit a leadoff homer, awkwardly silencing a sellout crowd of 48,613 that included rap star Jay-Z and other famous faces.Alejandro De Aza followed with another long ball to right, the first time Baltimore had started a game with consecutive homers since hitting three in a row against Texas on May 10, 2012.Jeter, however, hit an RBI double in the first against Gausman, who was 4 years old when Jeter made his major league debut. The ball banged off the left-center wall \xe2\x80\x94 just missing a home run by a couple of feet.""I went behind home plate to cover and I swear I felt the entire place shaking,"" Gausman said.TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: Pearce (right wrist) made his first start since Friday.UP NEXTOrioles RHP Chris Tillman (13-5) gets the ball Friday night in Toronto, a tuneup for his scheduled start in Game 1 of the playoffs next Thursday at Camden Yards. ...

09/27/2014,"[(""Orioles 2, Blue Jays 4: The game didn't matter, but did ..."", "" The Orioles and Blue Jays played a baseball game this afternoon. \xc2\xa0For the first time this year, the game meant literally nothing to the Orioles, after the Angels clinched the best record in the American League last night. \xc2\xa0And with the Blue Jays eliminated from Wild Card contention last week, this was a game with nothing at stake on either end, which led to silliness like Alexi Casilla getting a start at third base (since someone has to play there and he just replaced Preston Guilmet on the 40-man roster) and Nick Markakis getting another day off.    Wei-Yin Chen got the day's start, as nothing more than a tuneup for the AL Division Series, and he acquitted himself well enough. \xc2\xa0Even with the Jays deploying a lineup full of right-handed hitters to counter him, Chen put up a Chen-esque line of 6 IP, 3 R (2 earned), 3 K, 1 BB. \xc2\xa0The day included plenty of flyball outs, but if the Orioles had had Manny Machado at third base, Chen may have only allowed a single earned run. \xc2\xa0This, of course, is a matter of continued concern for the Orioles in the playoffs, since they won't have Machado. The Orioles started off the day's scoring after both teams went 1-2-3 quickly and quietly in the first inning. Nelson Cruz hit a sharp second-inning triple (yes, that's right) and got driven in by a Delmon Young single (the Orioles also deployed their lefty-mashing lineup against Jays starter J.A. Happ). But the Jays answered in the third inning with a quick series of hits that led to two runs. \xc2\xa0Kevin Pillar hit a one-out single, and Steve Tolleson and Jose Reyes hit back-to-back doubles to plate two runs in short order. \xc2\xa0Both doubles went down the third-base line, and not all that sharply, leading Orioles fans to undoubtedly wonder whether those were the sorts of plays that Manny Machado would have made.    Third base remained a point of concern in the fifth inning, with Reyes getting on base via an infield single, and advancing to second on a terrible throw by Casilla. \xc2\xa0Reyes would go on to score following a groundout that advanced him to third, and a goofy hit from Edwin Encarnacion that went off Chen's glove and didn't leave enough time for Hardy to throw out the runner at first. The Orioles pulled the game back to 3-2 with a mammoth Adam Jones home run (#29) in the top of the sixth that was smacked off the second-deck facade in left field. \xc2\xa0But the Jays tacked on another run after another Orioles defensive failure, where Pillar reached and advanced to second on a throwing error following a bunt, then advanced on a sacrifice, and then scored on a sacrifice fly to center. \xc2\xa0The play was initially called an out after a solid throw from Jones, but the call on the field was overturned following a lengthy replay, with Pillar getting ruled as safe on a bang-bang tag (and not for Caleb Joseph blocking the plate under MLB's new rules). Ultimately, the extra run, controversial though it was, did not matter, with the Jays securing a 4-2 victory after shutdown innings from Aaron Sanchez and Casey Janssen. \xc2\xa0What matters far more for Orioles fans is the defensive situation at third base. \xc2\xa0With Manny Machado out for the season and Chris Davis out for most of the playoffs on a suspension, the Orioles have rotated through a series of unsatisfactory defensive options (Kelly Johnson, Jimmy Paredes, Ryan Flaherty), one that continued tonight even with the new call-up of Alexi Casilla.    Fans can paper over the other aspects of recent losses, but the defense has been a cornerstone of the team's winning season, and third base looks like an unsolved part of that as the team heads into the playoffs. \xc2\xa0Today didn't matter, but some of the things it said about the current state of the team just might.

ending to his New York baseball career, when his signature hit \xe2\x80\x94 opposite-field single, first pitch \xe2\x80\x94 beat the Baltimore Orioles, 6-5, in the bottom of the ninth inning. He raised his arms in triumph, smiled widely, embraced teammates past and present. And then he went for a walk. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The point of baseball is to go home. Jeter, who understands the game as well as anyone ever has, did just that. He went to his home, shortstop, the position he played his entire career, never straying for even an inning to another spot.

This was it.

He said a prayer.\xe2\x80\x9cI basically just said thank you, because this is all I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever wanted to do, and not too many people get an opportunity to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said later. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was above and beyond anything that I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever dreamt of. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what to say. I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived a dream since I was 4 or 5 years old, and part of that dream is over now.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story       Continue reading the main story               More

Without Nelson Cruz, Adam Jones, Steve Pearce and J.J. Hardy, the Orioles were minus a significant amount of offensive punch.In Saturday\'s 4 p.m. game, expect to see Nick Markakis and Alejandro De Aza taking their day of rest. And expect Orioles manager Buck Showalter to begin using the bullpen en masse behind left-hander Wei-Yin Chen. Showalter said he will try to get left-hander Andrew Miller, who threw to three batters on Friday, back out there on Saturday.Showalter will be especially careful on the Rogers Centre turf, which is hard and unforgiving on legs and backs already worn down by a long baseball season. var adSkipCounter = 0; ** The Orioles hope to have veteran infielder Alexi Casilla here for today\xe2\x80\x99s game. He was scheduled to be on a red-eye flight from Phoenix through Chicago, where several flights were grounded because of an incident at the air traffic control center there.The timing of Casilla\xe2\x80\x99s arrival \xe2\x80\x93 with two days left in the regular season \xe2\x80\x93 is an interesting one. He probably would have joined the team when rosters expanded had it not been for a nagging hamstring injury. But the Orioles are bringing him here with a purpose. If he\xe2\x80\x99s here, he would likely play both Saturday and Sunday. His ability to play second, short and maybe even third is interesting.The Orioles defense has been sloppy the past two days, but keep in mind you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a modified \xe2\x80\x98B\xe2\x80\x99 squad for the most part.** Why do you rest your key players? Just look to Friday, when right-hander Chris Tillman was hit on the calf by a batted ball. Tillman was fine, but it was enough to remind Showalter.\xe2\x80\x9cIt definitely gives you some pause for concern,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a misstep by somebody or something that puts you in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way, but you have to play these games. Most importantly, our guys have to get some at bats and have to pitch. \xe2\x80\xa6 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got it mapped out how we want to do it between now and then in the context of competing, but you want to keep your priorities now because the finish line is a little different.\xe2\x80\x9d** Matt Wieters will be on a flight to Detroit on Saturday, where he will help out advance scout Bruce Kison and national cross-checker Danny Haas scouting the Tigers over the next two days as they finish their regular season slate against the Twins.Showalter said Wieters jumped at the opportunity to help scout. Even though he\xe2\x80\x99s out for the season following Tommy John elbow reconstruction surgery in June, he\xe2\x80\x99s never far from Showalter in the Orioles dugout and has been orienting catchers Nick Hundley and Caleb Joseph to the pitching staff.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been tough on Matt,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been a great contributor with the other catchers. Not many people would want to stay with the club like this, but you can tell he\xe2\x80\x99s very enthused and happy about what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with the club.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got Bruce Kison and Danny Haas there,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter added. \xe2\x80\x9cI called them today and they\xe2\x80\x99re excited about him coming. Matt didn\xe2\x80\x99t even hesitate. He said, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d love to help,\xe2\x80\x99 so he\xe2\x80\x99ll head there for the two games and probably beat us back to Baltimore.

09/28/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Worrying about the Defense', 'Sep 27, 2014; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Toronto Blue Jays short stop Jose Reyes (7) dives to second base on an error after his RBI single in fifth inning against Baltimore Orioles at Rogers Centre. Mandatory Credit: Peter Llewellyn-USA TODAY SportsWatching the baseball flying past Baltimore Orioles infielders while opponent runners circle the basepaths is not something that O\xe2\x80\x99s fans are accustomed to seeing. And the question that is raised is if this is something to be greatly concerned about as the playoffs season approaches.The problem of course is that it is difficult to replace a Platinum Glove winner in Manny Machado, a Gold Glover in Matt Wieters, and a top-tiered defensive first baseman in Chris Davis.The issue is especially obvious at third base, where there have been six errors in the past nine games. As well, there are other plays that are not being made that, while not counting as an error, are balls that Machado may well have turned into an out or prevented from going down the line into the left-field corner for extra bases.Over the past 12 games, the Orioles have committed a total of 13 errors. In those games, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have a record of 6-6. A total of 11 errors were committed in the six losses, while only two errors were recorded in the six wins.Defense is not everything, but a breakdown with it tends to multiply by becoming the seed that leads to more weeds growing. The other team is given more outs and Orioles pitchers need to throw more balls \xe2\x80\x93 diminishing their effectiveness and shortening their length in the game.Here is a breakdown of the 13 errors over the past dozen games:Ryan Flaherty \xe2\x80\x93 two throwing errorsKelly Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 twoJimmy Paredes \xe2\x80\x93 twoAlexi Casilla, Christian Walker, Brad Brach, J.J. Hardy, Caleb Joseph, Nick Hundley, Steve Clevenger \xe2\x80\x93 one eachThe throwing errors by Flaherty are the biggest concern on the list, since he will likely be the most featured player at third base. And while not a big Flare-dog fan, I think this is out of character and that he is a plus defender.J.J. Hardy will be solid, we know that.It has seemed that Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s level of play has gone down, and not just with his at-bats. But overall, the catching has been quite solid.Beyond this, the names on the list are mostly the end-of-season players who will either not be on the roster for the playoffs or featured much on the field.Since the clinching of the AL East title on September 16th, there has not been much in the way of a regular-looking Baltimore Orioles lineup. When the O\xe2\x80\x99s take the field on October 2nd, I think we can expect their generally stellar defense to be with them. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: This is NOT the end - Birds Watcher', 'There are a lot of beat writers across the Fansided Network who are preparing to chart their final games this afternoon \xe2\x80\x93 not this one. We\xe2\x80\x99ve now known for some time that the Baltimore Orioles would continue playing on after the final out in Toronto today, win or lose. And that, in and of itself, is pretty exciting for Orioles fans. If some of the tweets I got after yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-2 loss in Toronto are any indication however, lots of folks are worried going into the post season.Wei-Yin Chen tossed a quality start and he put the team in a position to win; they just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the job done. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6IP, 5 H, 3 R (2 earned) 1 BB, 3 K. Not surprisingly, Chen was pulled with a fairly low pitch count \xe2\x80\x93 79 to be exact. Buck Showalter is potentially using this last turn through the rotation as tune up games. Much in the tradition of NFL preseason, he wants guys to look sharp, get their work in, and get out. Chen did that yesterday, and he did it fairly effectively.The Birds took an early 1-0 lead in the second inning when Delmon Young singled in Nelson Cruz following Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s lead off triple. However Toronto took the lead an inning later. Former Oriole Steve Tolleson stroked an RBI-double to tie the score at one, and Jose Reyes\xe2\x80\x99 RBI-double gave them a 2-1 lead. Reyes would later score in the last of the fifth \xe2\x80\x93 the product of separate errors by Alexi Casilla and Christian Walker at first base. Toronto would later add on another on a sac fly, and Adam Jones would knotch a solo homer for the Orioles in whatCourtesy of Anthony Gruppuso-USA TODAY Sportsultimately turned out to be a losing effort as the O\xe2\x80\x99s fell 4-2.Alexi Casilla was added to the roster before the game and started at third base. As you can see, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop the parade of errors that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen at the hot corner of late, which is something that obviously has Buck Showalter somewhat concerned (which is why Casilla was brought up). It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear who will be playing third for the O\xe2\x80\x99s come the post season, however my personal opinion is that Ryan Flaherty will get the nod. However his presence now also has to throw Casilla\xe2\x80\x99s name into the mix.Overall, I would advise Orioles fans not to worry \xe2\x80\x93 yet. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important first off to note that the O\xe2\x80\x99s have used a different mix of guys in games for the most part since clinching the division. As time went on and they eventually clinched the number two spot in the American League, they further appeared to take their foot off the gas. Some people will argue that the act of taking one\xe2\x80\x99s foot off the gas in a sense shows organizational weakness, and for all I know those people might be right. However if you think back to last September, the Orioles had a lot of tired bats in their mix. I think Buck Showalter is trying to ensure that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.The Orioles will send Miguel Gonzalez to the mound this afternoon in the regular season finale against Toronto. But again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t stress enough that this is NOT the end for the Birds! Gonzalez will be opposed by Toronto knuckleballer R.A. Dickey, with game time being set for just after 1PM. So Baltimore fans can have their choice of the Ravens on TV and the O\xe2\x80\x99s on the radio today, or of course vice-versa!It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me in the least to see very few, if any, regulars in the game today. It\xe2\x80\x99s often said that it can take up to a week for hitters to get their timing back after facing a knuckleball pitcher, and as we know Dickey is one of the best in the game. The last thing Buck Showalter wants to do is to expose his hitters to a knuckler with the playoffs in the very near future. We won\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure until the lineups come along, however that\xe2\x80\x99s just my take.I\xe2\x80\x99ll also be interested to see how Miguel Gonzalez and the bullpen are managed today. Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s hinted at the fact that a lot of pitchers might see action in today\xe2\x80\x99s game. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if that means Gonzalez will be in for an inning and then someone else, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to wait and see.

Jeter hit .481 with 23 runs batted in for Kalamazoo Central High School. \r \r The Yankees released a statement about Jeter that simply stated he was the best athlete available. He signed with the club on June 27. Quick Ascent Through the Minors Within two months, Jeter jumped from Class A to Class AAA and is considered a candidate to start for the Yankees the next season, if his fielding is deemed reliable.  \r \r When asked what has most impressed him, Stump Merrill, Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s manager at Class AAA Columbus, said, ""Everything."" When asked what he needed to improve upon, Jeter said, ""Everything."" \r \r Jack Curry wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is polite and hesitant to say anything inflammatory, and his upbringing is right out of a Showalter playbook. Jeter\'s father, Charles, a drug and alcohol counselor, and his mother, an accountant, have lectured him about not being self-centered, and they gave him daily advice when reporters trekked to Columbus last week and focused on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r \r ""We want to make sure if he\'s talking to reporters that he\'s minding his P\'s and Q\'s,"" Dorothy Jeter said.\r  Minor Leaguer of the Year Jeter, who had been named Baseball America\'s minor league player of the year, was named USA Today Baseball Weekly\'s minor leaguer of the year. Jeter hit .344 with 68 runs batted in and 50 stolen bases for three Yankees farm clubs in 1994. \r Runners-up for the award included outfielder Ruben Rivera, who several years later would have his Yankees career end after he was accused of stealing Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s glove, and shortstop Alex Rodriguez, a future friend, rival and teammate of Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s.  Major League Debut Jeter, who started at shortstop, was hitless in five at-bats. The Yankees lost to the Seattle Mariners, 8-7, in 12 innings. \r \r Tom Friend wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cDerek Jeter, New York\'s shortstop prodigy who is not yet 21, was imported for his major league debut and had a chance to seize the game with two outs in the 11th inning. But he struck out with pinch-runner Gerald Williams on third. He went 0 for 5, even though his father woke up at 3 o\'clock this morning just to get here from Kalamazoo, Mich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r  Firsts Come Fast on Opening Day On the first opening day of his major league career, Jeter hit his first major league home run. It came off 40-year-old Dennis Martinez in his second at-bat. He also made a snazzy stop in the second inning and a snazzier over-the-shoulder grab to end the seventh. \r \r ""I don\'t know what to expect from Derek,"" Yankees Manager Joe Torre said. ""The only thing that I require and hopefully come to expect is that he play solid defense. Because when you\'re dealing with shortstops that\'s what you look for, and whatever offense you get.""\r  The Jeffrey Maier Game In Game 1 of the American League Championship Series against the Baltimore Orioles, Jeter hit a towering fly ball to right field off Armando Benitez. Tony Tarasco positioned himself for the catch by backing up against the wall. Tarasco waited for the ball to descend into his glove when a young fan, Jeffrey Maier, dipped his glove and scooped the ball over the wall as it glanced off his arm. Umpire Rich Garcia signaled home run and Tarasco and the Orioles fumed.\r \r ""Do I feel bad?"" Jeter said. ""We won the game. Why should I feel bad? Ask them that.""\r \r ""It was like a magic trick,"" Tarasco said. ""I was getting ready to catch it and suddenly a glove appeared and the ball disappeared. When the kid reached over the wall, the kid\'s glove was very close to mine. We almost touched gloves.""\r \r It was Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s fourth hit of the game. After the Yankees won the series with Baltimore, Jeter had a .415 playoff average over nine games. \r  First World Series Title  Jeter earned his first World Series ring after the Yankees defeated the Atlanta Braves in six games. In the series-clinching Game 6, Jeter drove in one of the team\xe2\x80\x99s three runs with a single in the third inning.  Rookie of the Year  The 22-year-old Jeter garnered all 28 first-place votes in becoming the fifth American Leaguer since the award\'s inception in 1947 to be a unanimous choice. In 1996, he hit .314 -- the highest among the 10 shortstops voted rookies of the year -- with 10 home runs, 78 runs batted in, 104 runs scored and 22 errors in 157 games. First All-Star Game Jeter is selected as a reserve on the 1998 American League All-Star team, the first of 13 career All-Star selections.  Second World Series Title The Yankees swept the San Diego Padres, giving Jeter his second World Series ring. Jeter batted .353 over the four games. \r \r ""I\'m a little young to know about the teams back in the early 1900s,"" the 24-year-old Jeter said, \'\'but we were 125-50, and there\'s not too many teams that can say that.""\r  Second All-Star Game  Jeter entered the All-Star break batting .371 with 14 home runs, 8 triples and 60 runs batted in, earning his second All-Star team selection.\r \r ""I don\'t think you should set any limits on yourself,"" Jeter said. ""You should set your goals high. You can\'t say you want to hit .300. What if you\'re doing better? I want to do well every year. I\'ve got a long way to go before I reach my potential.""\r  Third World Series Title  The Yankees swept the Atlanta Braves for the team\xe2\x80\x99s, and Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s, third title in four years. Jeter batted .375 over the team\xe2\x80\x99s 12 playoff games.  All-Star Game M.V.P. Jeter stroked three hits, knocked in two runs and scored one run to power the American League past the National League, 6-3, and become the first Yankee to win the most valuable player award in the All-Star Game. Manager Joe Torre chose his shortstop as the starter after Alex Rodriguez sustained a concussion, and Jeter poked a two-run single off the Mets\' Al Leiter in the fourth inning to break a 1-1 tie in helping the A.L. win the game for the fourth straight year. World Series M.V.P. With a home run in each of the final two games and a .409 batting average, Jeter was named the most valuable player of the Subway Series against the Mets, the fourth World Series title for the Yankees in five seasons. \r \r ""You could\'ve picked a name out of the hat; we have 25 M.V.P.\'s,"" Jeter said. ""First game, Vizcaino. What O\'Neill\'s done, our pitching staff, our bullpen, Luis Sojo. You don\'t rely on one guy.""\r  Cashes In on New Contract Jeter\'s contract with the Yankees, a 10-year, $189 million deal, produced the second-largest total payout in professional sports; only the $252 million contract signed by Alex Rodriguez with the Texas Rangers the previous December is larger. \r \r ""Derek Jeter embodies everything the Yankees are about,"" George Steinbrenner said in a statement released by the team. ""There are some things that cannot be defined by batting average, home runs and runs batted in. They\'re important, but they cannot totally define a player\'s worth to a team. And you\'d be making a mistake if you think they do. Equally important are an athlete\'s heart and desire. Derek exemplifies those qualities as well as any player.""\r  The Flip In Game 3 of an American League division series, Jeter made a defensive play in the seventh inning that preserved a 1-0 victory, helping to save the season for the Yankees, as the Athletics had a 2-0 lead in the series. \r \r With Jeremy Giambi at first base, Terrence Long ripped a two-out double into the right-field corner. Giambi was waved home as Shane Spencer, the right fielder, raced into the corner and retrieved the ball. He turned and threw to the infield. But he overthrew both of his relay men, Alfonso Soriano, the second baseman, and Tino Martinez, the first baseman.\r \r Jeter raced across the infield, grabbed the loose ball near the first-base line and, with his momentum taking him away from the plate, turned and flipped the ball to catcher Jorge Posada.\r \r Giambi tried to leap over Posada\'s tag (instead of sliding), and Kerwin Danley, the plate umpire, called him out.\r \r Giambi said the play showed the ""kind of instincts Derek Jeter has on the field, the kind of player he is."" He added, ""The ball looked like it was rolling away from Posada, so I\'m sure it would have been a dead play.""\r  Mr. November On Oct. 31, 2001, in the ninth inning of Game 4 of the World Series, Arizona Diamondbacks closer Byung-hyun Kim was one out away from putting his team one victory from a World Series title.\r \r But the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 Tino Martinez wiped out the Diamondbacks\' lead with a two-run home run to center field. With two outs and the bases empty in the next inning, Jeter finished off Kim with a game-winning homer just inside the right-field foul pole shortly after midnight. The dramatic blast and the late hour helped spawn a new nickname for Jeter: Mr. November.\r  Hosts \'Saturday Night Live\' Jeter became the third person associated with the Yankees to host the sketch comedy television program ""Saturday Night Live."" Billy Martin hosted on May 26, 1986, between managerial stints with the Yankees, and the team\xe2\x80\x99s principal owner, George Steinbrenner, hosted on Oct. 20, 1990. Feud With Steinbrenner  In December 2002, Steinbrenner publicly criticized Jeter, saying he lacked focus and was keeping late hours. Jeter\'s charity work and bachelor lifestyle, the team owner suggested, were detracting from his performance. \r \r ""He\'s the boss and he\'s entitled to his opinion, right or wrong, but what he said has been turned into me being this big party animal,"" Jeter told The Associated Press. ""He even made a reference to one birthday party. That\'s been turned into that I\'m like Dennis Rodman now. I don\'t think that\'s fair. I have no problems with people criticizing how I play. But it bothers me when people question my work ethic. That\'s when you\'re talking about my integrity.""\r  First Significant Injury On opening day, Jeter dislocated his left shoulder in a collision at third base with Toronto Blue Jays catcher Ken Huckaby. He returned to the field on May 13.  It was the first serious injury of Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s career. He would perform at a high level for the rest of the season, scoring 87 runs and batting .324. The Captain Steinbrenner made official what was already assumed in the team\xe2\x80\x99s clubhouse: that Jeter was the captain of the Yankees.\r \r ""I think he can hopefully pull them together,"" Steinbrenner said. ""I think he can give them a little spark. I just feel it\'s the right time to do it. People may say, \'What a time to pick.\' Well, why not? He represents all that is good about a leader. I\'m a great believer in history, and I look at all the other leaders down through Yankee history, and Jeter is right there with them.""\r  Rodriguez Joins Yankees Alex Rodriguez, one of the most productive players in baseball and once a close friend of Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s, was traded to the Yankees from the Texas Rangers. \r \r Their friendship reportedly took a turn when Rodriguez said some unflattering things about Jeter three years before in an article in Esquire magazine. Jeter was irritated when Rodriguez told Esquire that when preparing for the Yankees, Jeter was ""never your concern."" The implication was that Jeter was benefiting from being in a better situation with the mighty Yankees and that he was not as talented as Rodriguez.\r \r Afterward, Jeter was said to retreat. Their friendship cooled. The passage of time and Rodriguez\'s explanation of how a few critical comments should not undermine dozens of laudatory remarks he had made about Jeter over the years reduced the tension.\r \r As part of the deal, Rodriguez agreed to move from shortstop to third base so that Jeter could stay at short. The Dive Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s defensive play in the 12th inning kept the score tied, 4-4, in a memorable game with the Boston Red Sox that the Yankees won in 13 innings. \r \r Trot Nixon hit a pop-up to the left side of the field, and no fielder besides Jeter was close to it. From his position at shortstop, Jeter raced to his right. With two outs and a runner at third, a hit would have given the Red Sox the lead. But Jeter sprinted and swiped the ball from the air in fair territory. Unable to stop his momentum, he tumbled into the seats, spikes high, several rows back. \r \r ""Greatest catch I\'ve ever seen,"" Rodriguez said. ""It was unbelievable. He\'s just so unselfish. He put his body in a compromising spot. It was hard to watch."" \r \r Rodriguez followed Jeter in and waved for help. As a trainer went onto the field, Jeter emerged from among the fans and stood above them for a moment as he climbed a wall to get back on the field. Jeter sustained a laceration of his chin that required stitches, a bruised right cheek and a bruised right shoulder.  First Gold Glove  Jeter won his first Gold Glove award, for the shortstop position, as voted on by American League managers and coaches. Rodriguez had won the last two, but Rodriguez moved to third base when he joined the Yankees. Opening Day Heroics On opening day at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees trailed the Royals, 7- 6, with two out and two on in the bottom of the eighth. Jeter got into a first-pitch, split-finger fastball from Kansas City reliever Ambiorix Burgos, pulling it into the left-field seats and lifting the team to a victory. \r \r ""I\'ve watched this kid for 11 years,"" Joe Torre said. ""It seems when something needs to happen, he\'s at the start of it or the finish of it.""\r  Falls Short of M.V.P. Award  In 2006, Jeter hit .343 with 97 runs batted in and had a .417 on-base percentage, his highest totals since 1999. He was also a steady force in a Yankees lineup ravaged by injuries, and he won a Gold Glove at shortstop. Jeter was a leading candidate to win the American League M.V.P. award but lost out to Justin Morneau of the Minnesota Twins. \r \r \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say it a thousand times, but winning the World Series for the New York Yankees continues to be my main focus,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no individual award that can compare with a championship trophy, and I look forward to working towards that challenge again in 2007.\xe2\x80\x9d\r  Yankee Stadium Farewell After the final game at the old Yankee Stadium, Jeter addressed the 54,610 fans in attendance. \r \r \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we are relying on you to take the memories from this stadium, add them to the new memories to come at the new Yankee Stadium, and continue to pass them on from generation to generation,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter told the crowd.\r \r Harvey Araton wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is the quiet captain, aloof even, some have argued, but everything he said Sunday night was pitched perfectly, and not just on the field. Before the game, he was asked what made Yankee Stadium so different. The lights, for one thing, he said. They always seemed brighter than elsewhere. He said he imagined actors feeling likewise playing Broadway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r  Captain of Team USA Jeter was the captain of the United States team at the 2009 World Baseball Classic. \r \r \xe2\x80\x9cAs a young player in New York, you try to emulate certain guys,\xe2\x80\x9d the team\xe2\x80\x99s third baseman, David Wright, said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m excited to have a locker next to him and play next to him. Obviously, he\xe2\x80\x99s a class act. I\xe2\x80\x99m interested to get in his head a little bit. This is a huge learning experience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r  Most Hits for a Shortstop Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s first two hits against the Seattle Mariners tied and broke the record for career hits by a shortstop, held by the Hall of Fame player Luis Aparicio, who had 2,673 while playing the position. \r \r \xe2\x80\x9cI just try to be consistent year in and year out, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re consistent, good things happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said, when asked about his record. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of hard to believe, to say the least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r  Most Hits for a Yankee Jeter added another important milestone, passing Lou Gehrig on the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 career hits list with his 2,722nd.\r \r \xe2\x80\x9cI never imagined, I never dreamt of this,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said. \xe2\x80\x9cYour dream was always to play for the team. Once you get here, you just want to stay and try to be consistent. So this really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a part of it. The whole experience has been overwhelming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r \r George Vecsey wrote: ""Jeter has accomplished this feat in his prime, not backing into it, some grand old man playing a few days a week, designated hitter, backup first baseman, the stuff of old age, way down the pike. He breaks the record lean and spry and relatively healthy, although how would anybody know? Joe Torre \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Torre \xe2\x80\x94 would ask how he felt, and Jeter would say, \'I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\' Tells that to the trainers, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r  Wins Fifth World Series The Yankees captured their first title since 2000, defeating the defending champion, the Philadelphia Phillies, 7-3, in Game 6 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium. \r \r \xe2\x80\x9cWe play the game the right way,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we deserve to be standing here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r  New Contract After Turbulent Negotiations A protracted stalemate with the Yankees ended when Jeter agreed to a three-year, $51 million deal.\r \r The negotiations were not smooth, and Jeter expressed anger afterward about how the organization handled them, particularly the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion, through the news media, that he explore free agency if he was not satisfied with their offer. \r \r \xe2\x80\x9cTo hear the organization tell me to go shop it when I just told you I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to \xe2\x80\x94 if I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be honest with you, I was angry about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said.\r \r He added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was an uncomfortable position that I felt I was in. It was not an enjoyable experience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r  3,000th Hit Jeter slammed a home run in the third inning for his 3,000th hit, and capped a five-hit day with the go-ahead single in the eighth inning of a 5-4 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays at Yankee Stadium. \r \r \xe2\x80\x9cIt was relief,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said of his emotions. \xe2\x80\x9cI was excited but, to be honest with you, I was just pretty relieved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r \r Tyler Kepner wrote: ""However the rest of his career plays out, Jeter \xe2\x80\x94  whose 5-for-5 day raised his career average by a point, to .313 \xe2\x80\x94 will be known most for relentless consistency, for churning out hits at a rate few have matched. Jeter has 10 seasons with at least 190 hits. Only Rose and Cobb, who rank first and second on the career list, have more such seasons.""\r  Fractures Ankle in A.L.C.S. In Game 1 of the American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers, Jeter broke his left ankle diving for a ground ball in the 12th inning. He missed the rest of the postseason, and the Yankees lost the series. \r \r \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that he was hurt is one thing, and also the fact that he knows that he can\xe2\x80\x99t be there for them to play,\xe2\x80\x9d Torre, the former Yankees manager, said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds hokey, but it\xe2\x80\x99s true. He\xe2\x80\x99s indestructible. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of those things; you never even question whether he stumbles and falls if he\xe2\x80\x99s going to play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r \r During the regular season, Jeter led the major leagues in hits, with 216, while batting .316.\r  A Brief Return to Action After eight months, Jeter returned from ankle surgery, and beat out an infield single in his first at-bat. He also scored a run as the Yankees beat the Kansas City Royals, 8-4.\r \r But Jeter endured another setback. He felt tightness in his right quadriceps while grounding out to second in his next-to-last at-bat of the day and was later removed from the game. The injury kept him off the field until July 28. \r  A Home Run in His Return  Jeter returned after a 17-day absence with a quadriceps strain, on top of missing the first 91 games recovering from his fractured ankle, and hit a home run on the first pitch thrown to him. \r \r \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a movie,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Joe Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think about his 3,000th hit, how he did that. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t hit a home run since the All-Star break. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a right-handed home run in months. For him to come out and do that his first swing, he\xe2\x80\x99s a movie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r  Jeter\xe2\x80\x99s Season Ends Jeter was placed on the 15-day disabled, and his season, General Manager Brian Cashman said, was over regardless of whether the Yankees made the postseason. \r \r \xe2\x80\x9cThe entire year has pretty much been a nightmare physically,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s fitting that it ends like this, huh?""\r \r \xe2\x80\x9cI truly believe with a full off-season of working out and getting my strength back that I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to doing what I\xe2\x80\x99ve always done,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r  Announces His Retirement Jeter, entering his 20th season with the Yankees, announced that 2014 would be his final year of professional baseball.\r \r \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced so many defining moments in my career,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said. \xe2\x80\x9cWinning the World Series as a rookie shortstop, being named the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 captain, closing the old and opening the new Yankee Stadium. Through it all, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never stopped chasing the next one. I want to finally stop the chase and take in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r \r George Vecsey wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cJeter has done something more than help win seven pennants and five World Series. He helped turn the Yankees into a team that Mets fans, Red Sox fans, can respect (at least some of them; there are always hardheads). He and his contemporaries \xe2\x80\x94 Bernie Williams, Jorge Posada, Mariano Rivera and Andy Pettitte, as well as Joe Torre (whom Jeter calls Mr. T) and Joe Girardi \xe2\x80\x94 took some of the starch and bluster and gloom and doom out of the old Yankee ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r  Final Home Opener  Yankees fans in the Bronx were given their first chance to salute Jeter during the team\'s 2014 home opener. Jeter contributed a double to the Yankees\' 4-2 victory.\r \r Before the game, Jeter\'s former teammates Andy Pettitte,  Mariano Rivera and Jorge Posada joined him for the ceremonial first pitch.  Ties Aparicio With 2,583 Games at Shortstop With the Yankees facing the Chicago White Sox, Jeter was in the lineup for his 2,583rd game at shortstop, putting him in a tie for second among all shortstops with Luis Aparicio, a White Sox great who was an integral part of their 1959 pennant-winning team. Only Omar Vizquel has played more games (2,709) at the position.\r \r \xe2\x80\x9cAparicio!\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said after the game, a 6-5 Yankees loss. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone knows how great he is. I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s ironic that we\xe2\x80\x99re here. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe when you think about the history of the game and there is only one guy who has played more games."" Milestone of a Different Kind: Turns 40 Jeter turned 40 years old, and his gift was a day off on the schedule, as the Yankees were off. \r \r \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like any other birthday; I don\xe2\x80\x99t pay much attention to numbers,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said the night before, when the Yankees broke a four-game losing streak by defeating the Toronto Blue Jays, 5-3. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mind-set is to treat it no differently than any other age. Once you start sitting around thinking about getting older, you cause yourself some problems.\xe2\x80\x9d Plays in Final All-Star Game Derek Jeter led off the All-Star Game with a double that sparked a three-run inning as the American League topped the National League and gained home-field advantage for the World Series. Derek Jeter Day The Yankees held a ceremony to honor Jeter, their shortstop, before allowing two unearned runs, recording only four hits and losing to Kansas City.\r \r \r \r The Yankees removed the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 flag \xe2\x80\x94 and the flag of every other major league team \xe2\x80\x94 from atop Yankee Stadium, ringing their imperial palace with Jeter flags. His No. 2 flapped overhead while adorning the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 sleeves and caps down below, as it will for the rest of the season. Final Game at Yankee Stadium He almost started crying as he drove himself to Yankee Stadium in the afternoon. He had to turn away from his teammates before the game when they presented him with gifts, so overcome was he by the emotion. In the first inning, he said, he barely knew what was happening, and later, in the top of the ninth, his eyes welled with tears to the point that he worried that he might break down in front of the crowd of 48,613.\r \r But when the time came for Derek Jeter to get a game-winning hit, to add another signature moment to a long list of achievements over his 20-year career, he knew exactly what to do, and seemingly no one doubted that he would.\r \r With one out in the bottom of the ninth, Jeter stroked the winning hit and ended his Yankee Stadium career the way he had ended so many games \xe2\x80\x94 with both arms raised in celebration. The 6-5 win over the Baltimore Orioles was his 1,627th regular-season victory as a Yankee. Plays in Final Game Derek Jeter played his last game Sunday, ending his career with a play typical of his time in the majors, in which he hustled out an infield single for his 3,465th hit.\r \r As Jeter stood at first base, in the top of the third inning against Boston, Manager Joe Girardi made a slashing motion at his throat, asking with the hand signal if that was it for Jeter. Jeter nodded.\r \r The fans had been standing from the moment he had come to the plate, but the cheering and the \xe2\x80\x9cDerek Jeter\xe2\x80\x9d chants grew louder. Jeter handed his arm and foot pads to the first-base coach, Mick Kelleher, and patted him on the helmet. He waited for Brian McCann, the pinch-runner, to arrive and gave him a heartfelt hug.

Owens | For The Baltimore SunTalking with Boog Powell can make you hungry. By the time the former Orioles star and current barbecue master has rhapsodized about the pleasures of, say, pit beef with horseradish sauce, homemade buttermilk biscuits and grilled asparagus with rosemary, chances are your mouth will be watering.""Oh, I love food,"" says the 6-foot-4 former slugger, laughing heartily. ""I enjoy eating a good meal, whether it\'s steamed crabs, or collard greens and cornbread. \xe2\x80\xa6 But my favorite is barbecue.""His passion for barbecue \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention family, friends and, of course, baseball \xe2\x80\x94 are shared in a new book titled, ""Baltimore Baseball & Barbecue with Boog Powell: Stories from the Orioles\' Smokey Slugger.""Co-written with former Baltimore Sun columnist Rob Kasper, the memoir-meets-cookbook is a walk down memory lane that highlights Powell\'s baseball glory days, complemented by recipes and vintage photos. Extras include interviews with other Orioles\' legends. var adSkipCounter = 0; The book\'s timing seems serendipitous: The O\'s, newly minted 2014 American League East Division champions, are scheduled to play Game 1 of the American League Division Series on Thursday.""When I think back about my 70-plus years on this earth, I see a lot of the idiosyncrasies that made me who I am,"" Powell, 73, writes in the introduction. ""As my former Oriole teammate Brooks Robinson put it, I \'live large.\' I also see a theme, an abiding interest in food.""John Wesley Powell, Sr. \xe2\x80\x94 nicknamed Boog at an early age, although the specific details about why could be lost to history \xe2\x80\x94 grew up with his parents and two brothers in Lakeland, Fla.Theirs wasn\'t a fancy lifestyle, but his mother, Julia Mae, is described in the book as a good cook who showered her boys with love. When Powell was 10 years old, she died. It was a heartbreaking time, but his grandmother Ruth, known as Rucy, assumed control of the family\'s kitchen.""One of her specialties was biscuits,"" Powell recalls. ""She made them with buttermilk, which was called sour milk in those days. I still do a version of them, but they can\'t touch hers.""According to the book, his father, called Red, turned him on to grilling. They cooked ribs, steak and seafood over an open fire on the shores of the old phosphate pits \xe2\x80\x94 similar to lakes \xe2\x80\x94 behind their home.\xc2\xa0 ""We never had a fancy grill, just an old refrigerator grate,"" says Powell. ""Dad used hickory wood, and the smoke would flavor the meat. That paved the way for how I do barbecue today.""Red would remarry, and a stepbrother joined the fold. The boys fished, rode bikes and played lots of baseball. Powell was 12 when his local team earned a spot in the Little League World Series; by 1961, the 20-year-old was in the major leagues.He played 14 seasons for the Orioles. The stellar first baseman became a four-time All Star and helped the team win the World Series in 1966 and 1970.Along the way, Powell was introduced to Baltimore\'s pit beef \xe2\x80\x94 seasoned top round cooked over charcoal, sliced thin and piled on a roll. The book notes that a caterer at Memorial Stadium pushed the meat through the fence before a game as Powell shagged fly balls; he kept it in his glove.Powell honed his recipes and smoking techniques at social gatherings that he and wife, Jan, hosted at their rowhouse in Baltimore. His teammates say that even back then, his food hit a home run.""Boog used to have us over for parties, and we\'d eat and drink in the backyard,"" says former teammate and onetime O\'s catcher Andy Etchebarren, who spoke by phone from his home in South Carolina. ""He is a great cook, a great barbecuer. And he\'s a very good friend.""Despite their bond, the book notes that Etchebarren wasn\'t amused when Powell pressed him to sample oysters for the first time.""I\'m from Southern California and I wasn\'t about to eat them raw,"" he remembers. ""Boog told me if I didn\'t, he\'d toss me over the balcony of the apartment where we were staying during spring training. I wasn\'t too crazy about them, but now I eat oysters. Boog even makes his own sauce for them.""Since retiring from baseball in 1977, Powell has reinvented himself. He previously owned a marina in Key West where his family maintains a home (the other is in Grasonville); he\'s been a popular pitchman for Miller Lite beer; and he has become a barbecue entrepreneur. Powell\'s first book, ""Mesquite Cookery,"" was published in 1986.His reputation really soared when Oriole Park at Camden Yards opened its gates in 1992. Boog\'s Bar-B-Q, situated on the Eutaw Street promenade, was a ""concept"" concession, melding his personal appearances with the food offerings.There are typically long lines of customers eager to sample the overstuffed pit beef, barbecued turkey and pork sandwiches, and homey sides such as baked beans and coleslaw. House-made kettle chips, a newer snack, round out the menu.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldPriest at once defended, excoriated1969 slayings of 2 women forge police-FBI liaisonA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

He has lived through so many lean times that these playoff moments will not pass without his best efforts. He is ready.If the above can be said for Jones, it may be even more emphatically stated about Nick Markakis.

Not gone is the inner wound of having to watch Orioles playoff games in 2012 with an injury. This is his time; this is the culmination of all these years with the Orioles as the most veteran member of the organization. He is ready.Nelson Cruz had a great start to the season and carried the team through the difficult early two months of the season \xe2\x80\x93 keeping their collective head above the water until the pitching could come around and take the load. The middle months were horribly anemic (.214 over the summer), but September brought back the big bat from the early season. The homers were not quite as frequent, but the hits against the shift and balls in the gaps were abundant as he batted .349.\xc2\xa0 He has extensive playoff experience, and he\xc2\xa0is ready.No team sends all eight or nine guys to the plate with high averages at the top of their game. Everyone has a hole or two, and sometimes those types of ordinary players step up and become a star through the playoffs. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about a Rick Dempsey sort of performance \xe2\x80\x93 Dempsey, who was a .231 hitter in 1983 in a .233 career. But he was the World Series MVP that season with four doubles and a homer.So who could be a bottom-half-of-the-order player to catch fire for a couple of weeks and make a difference? Could it be Alejandro De Aza? Jonathan Schoop? Ryan Flaherty? Steve Pearce is less within\xc2\xa0this category after his great season, but we know what can happen when he gets very comfortable at the plate.

This kind of confusion carries over into some number-heavy Internet baseball outlets as well. The Orioles have managed to succeed in recent years in ways that don\'t necessarily fit into pre-existing notions of how a successful team should be built, or what it should look like.    Although this can occasionally drive O\'s fans (myself included) into annoyed fits, it is not necessarily a bad thing. The Baltimore fan thrives on that disrespect. It\'s what makes the world go \'round. The haughty, condescending doubt - best illustrated by Keith Law of ESPN\'s famous 2011 declaration that whoever would take the then-vacant Orioles GM job (now held by Dan Duquette) would have to be someone with no self-respect - fuels the indignant rants about not giving the O\'s proper credit. In turn, the Orioles succeeding in spite of proclamations like that makes the success feel that much sweeter. They were wrong and Orioles fans were right. We are happier for having had the chance to unleash those rants. Much better that than arrogantly basking in universal praise. What would that even be like, where everyone just thinks you\'re the best and never questions it? Orioles fans certainly don\'t know and probably never will. When that class of baseball commentator starts to talk up the Orioles, I almost don\'t know what to do with myself. I ran into this in reading a Monday column by\xc2\xa0Jayson Stark on ESPN where he polled 15 team executives whose teams are not in the playoffs about who would win the pennant in each league. Seven of the people he talked to put forth the Orioles as their AL winner, with two of them even thinking the Orioles might win the World Series. They gave quotes like this:     ""The X factor in all of this,"" said one scout, ""is Buck [Showalter]. There\'s a certain level of magic going on with this guy that I haven\'t seen in a while. He\'s so prepared with matchups and with his thought process, he always seems like he\'s ahead of the game. It makes me think this might be Baltimore\'s year.""     A baseball scout is basically talking about Orioles Magic. That is awesome. At the same time, it also gives me the creeps. Guys who don\'t understand the Orioles at all were predicting their doom. Now, still not understanding the Orioles, they predict success? They don\'t have a track record of being right. To be sure, this scout may have been appreciating what the Orioles are doing all season long. Maybe he wishes his own team was doing things more like the Orioles. You never really know when the source is just ""a scout."" There are many and they all have different opinions. But still, it\'s weird to see it written on ESPN that the Orioles could win the World Series.    Even weirder:   Your eyes do not deceive you. Half of the ESPN experts here think the Orioles will win this series against the team that has the last three AL Cy Young winners and the guy who probably didn\'t deserve two straight AL MVPs but did deserve two straight runner-ups, so what\'s the difference really? Miguel Cabrera is good. Max Scherzer is good. David Price is good. Justin Verlander has a strong track record. Victor Martinez led MLB in OPS. The Orioles cast of characters, after being frequently - though not in all quarters - disparaged throughout the year, with pundits proclaiming things like ""they are an okay team with an inflated record"", is supposed to beat that team of stars? Well, sure. Allowing the third-fewest runs in the American League doesn\'t happen by accident. Maybe they don\'t have the star power on the pitching side, but Nelson Cruz led the majors in home runs and Adam Jones was one of the best players in the league. The O\'s are not without a couple of stars of their own, and their rotation, after a full season under the tutelage of pitching coach Dave Wallace, might well be capable of holding off Detroit for long enough to let an elite bullpen take over.    Still, it\'s enough to make you nervous. If you\'re expected to win and you lose, that sucks. If you\'re expected to lose and you win, that\'s awesome. Losing when favored brings out phrases like choke job, collapse, all kinds of un-fun stuff. Winning when you\'re the underdog, well, that\'s what it\'s all about. At least for me. Now the Orioles might not even be proper underdogs. Before we panic that we are losing that, you might have noticed, if you went through the link to Stark\'s article, that its title is: ""Why the Nats will win the World Series."" Are we going to anoint as World Series favorites the team that cakewalked through the only division in baseball where only the division leader was above .500, really? Name as darlings those turncoat upstarts to the South who have been engaged in a multi-year conspiracy with MLB to screw the Orioles out of millions of dollars? This team that played a mere 46 games against over-.500 teams and went only .500 in those games - that\'s who we\'re going with as the favorites, really? Way to disrespect the Orioles, ESPN. Maybe if you stopped letting your blind love of Bryce Harper lead you astray, you might actually observe a thing or two about baseball. And just like that, everything is back the way it should be. Now, please bring on the Tigers, whatever time they end up playing the games. Thursday at 5:37 or 6:07 can\'t get here soon enough. Here\'s hoping that scout is right about Orioles Magic. Just don\'t tell anyone that I sounded confident for a second there, okay? I\'ve got an image to uphold.     ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles confident of success, even without stars - Yahoo', ""View photosBaltimore Orioles starting pitcher Miguel Gonzalez throws against the Toronto Blue Jays during the first inning of a baseball game Sunday, Sept. 28, 2014, in Toronto. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Fred Thornhill)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles prefer to focus on what they have rather than who they're missing when assessing their chances of advancing deep into the postseason.The Orioles went 96-66 and cruised to their first AL East title since 1997 with a standard formula for success: a power-laden lineup, strong pitching and solid defense.They have no reason to believe anything will change in the playoffs, even though they will begin the AL division series against Detroit on Thursday without three former All-Stars - catcher Matt Wieters, third baseman Manny Machado and first baseman Chris Davis.Wieters underwent season-ending elbow surgery in May, Machado was lost in August with a torn knee ligament and Davis is serving a 25-game suspension for using amphetamines.Their absence doesn't seem to bother the Orioles.''There are other guys,'' said center fielder Adam Jones, who hit .281 with 29 homers and 96 RBIs. ''Not one person makes a team. We've got guys that can fill in, we've got guys that have the same hunger and understand our method and approach to this game. All the guys that have filled in in the wake of injuries have stepped right in and played the game.''Rookie Caleb Joseph and Nick Hundley will never be confused with Wieters, a two-time All-Star and winner of two Gold Gloves. But Joseph exceeded expectations after finally making it to the big leagues in his seventh pro season, and Hundley contributed immediately after Orioles executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette acquired him in a trade with San Diego on May 24.Manager Buck Showalter alternated both of them wisely, and the Orioles kept on winning.''When Wieters went down. It was like a turning point for the team,'' closer Zach Britton said. ''We could have gone bad, but everyone decided, 'You know what? Do a little bit extra.' We brought up Caleb and acquired Nick. At that moment, everything started clicking. Pitching was there, offense was there. The bullpen, we started doing our job, too. It's been that way ever since.''After Machado departed in August, the same thought process applied.''Having that experience with Matt going down made it easier with Manny,'' Britton said.When Davis missed time earlier in the season with a rib cage injury, Steve Pearce took over at first base. Pearce (.293, 21 homers) has been invaluable, and a good team got even better when Duquette traded for reliever Andrew Miller, third baseman Kelly Johnson and outfielder Alejandro De Aza.''When somebody gets hurt you need to have somebody step up and fill in,'' Duquette said. ''Fortunately, we had a little bit of bench strength in players like Steve Pearce, and some of the players we added during the season did a nice job, Caleb Joseph in particular.''One of Duquette's best moves came before the season, when he signed free agent slugger Nelson Cruz to an $8 million, one-year contract. Cruz had the best year of his career, hitting a major-league leading 40 homers and driving in 108 runs.Cruz, who played in two World Series with Texas, knows a winning team when he sees one.''We have a group of guys, the young guys and veterans, who have a lot of personality,'' he said. ''It doesn't matter how tough the game is or how difficult it looks to come back, we find a way to get it done. If it's not the hitting, it's the pitching. I think we have one of the best managers in the league to keep everybody on their toes; he's always moving the pieces.''The Orioles led the majors with 211 homers, had four starters finish with double-digit wins and are very efficient in the back end of the bullpen. That just might be enough to get them into the World Series for the first time since 1983.''Offensively they swing bats well, they hit home runs,'' Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ''Defensively, they're very good, very sharp. And they pitch well. I've said all along, maybe they don't have that big name ace but they have a lot of good starters and their bullpen is strong.''That is why the Orioles are extremely confident about the prospect of playing deep into October.''We find ways to win,'' Pearce said. ''When we find ourselves in big games, everybody's been stepping up all year. That's why we are where we are, and that's what you need to do this time of year.'' "", 'www.yahoo.com')]"

The Detroit Tigers start the playoffs at the Baltimore Orioles in Game 1 of the American League Division Series Thursday. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers' starting pitchers in the first three games of the AL Division Series have a combined 329 wins, three Cy Young Awards and 35 games of postseason experience.Baltimore's starters carry less impressive credentials, yet they don't necessarily have to outpitch their Detroit counterparts for the Orioles to advance.All they have to do is keep it close, then hand the baseball over to one of the best bullpens in major leagues.Detroit (90-72) didn't win as many games as the Orioles (96-66), who ran away with the AL East title to earn home-field advantage in the best-of-five series that begins Thursday. But the AL Central-champion Tigers have been installed as a slight favorite - mainly because of their formidable starting rotation.Max Scherzer (18-5, 3.15 ERA) starts on Thursday, followed by Justin Verlander (15-12, 4.54) and David Price (15-12, 3.26). That also happens to be a list of the last three AL Cy Young winners.Advantage, Detroit?''I think we all know what it looks like on paper,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said Wednesday. ''But there's a lot of things that look a certain way on paper for us that we were able to overcome.''Orioles right-hander Chris Tillman (13-6, 3.34 ERA) will make his first foray into the postseason in the opener. Although Showalter declined the announced his starters for Friday and Sunday, they will likely be Wei-Yin Chen (16-6, 3.54) and Miguel Gonzalez (10-9, 3.23), each of whom has pitched in exactly one playoff game.If playoff experience and Cy Young Awards mean anything, then Detroit has a decent chance to reach the AL Championship Series for a fourth straight year.''Pitching. That's what wins ballgames,'' Price said. ''If we put up zeroes early, that kind of gives our offense a chance to kind of settle into the game. They know they don't have to put up a three- or four-spot because we're down.''But if a game is close in the seventh inning, the Orioles like their chances.''We've got a good bullpen, we have a good starting staff,'' said closer Zach Britton, who finished with 37 saves. ''Anytime there's a close game, we're confident we can pull it out, and we've done that a lot this year.''Britton (1.65 ERA) usually works the ninth inning. Andrew Miller (1.35 ERA in 23 games with Baltimore) or Darren O'Day (1.70) take care of the eighth, following hard-throwing Tommy Hunter.Back in May, when Detroit last played the Orioles, Hunter (3-2, 2.97 ERA) was the closer and Miller was still pitching for Boston.Much has changed.''Britton has really established himself since we last saw Baltimore. He's one of the best closers in the game,'' Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said. ''They acquired Andrew Miller, who obviously had a track record coming in. And now you've got a closer who can pitch the sixth or seventh inning. That's not a bad position to be in if you're the Orioles. Their bullpen has done a good job, and that's part of the reason they've been so successful.''Ausmus has been calling upon Joba Chamberlain to work the eighth and Joe Nathan to get the final three outs. The duo experienced mixed results during the regular season - Chamberlain was 2-5 with four blown saves and a 3.57 ERA, and Nathan finished 5-4 with seven blown saves and a lofty 4.81 ERA.Advantage Baltimore?''Britton, from what I've seen, his ball's moving all over the place,'' Tigers outfielder Torii Hunter said. ''They've got a nice little bullpen over there. We've seen some dirty pitching (in the AL Central), so I don't think it will be new, but it will be tough. Those guys are good.''Scherzer, meanwhile, hasn't faced the Orioles since June 17, 2013. He knows this much: Baltimore led the majors with 211 home runs, so the right-hander had better be careful.''A team that swings the bat like that, they're dangerous,'' he said. ''They're dangerous one through nine. That's something I know going into the start. They need to have a good game plan against me and I need to have a good game plan against them.''In other news, Ausmus declined to name his 25-man roster in part because of the status of injured outfielder Rajai Davis, who has pelvic strain.''Rajai came in today, felt much better, but we've got to get past the point of his making some baseball moves in terms of running, exploding out of the box and taking swings, which he hasn't done yet,'' said Ausmus, who has until 10 a.m. Thursday to make his final decision.

There are layers to much of what he says, and deeper meaning than most in his audience probably realize.So maybe, as he stood near the batting cage one morning in March at Ed Smith Stadium in Sarasota, Fla., Showalter meant something other than what he actually said. But when presented with the premise that his team would win the American League East \xe2\x80\x94 and perhaps the A.L. pennant \xe2\x80\x94 largely because it could outslug the field in an era of depressed offense, Showalter dismissed the theory.\xe2\x80\x9cGood pitching always trumps good hitting \xe2\x80\x94 always,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before an exhibition game with the Tampa Bay Rays. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can talk about every one of these clubs, but Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s going to be there all year because of their pitching, and I think their offense is improved, too. When hitting\xe2\x80\x99s on top of its game and pitching\xe2\x80\x99s on top of its game, pitching wins. Always. It trumps it in the playoffs, it always trumps it.\xe2\x80\x9d Photo       The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Kelly Johnson is the first man to play for all five teams currently in the A.L. East.  Credit             Patrick Semansky/Associated Press           Well, Tampa Bay was never in the pennant race at all, despite strong pitching, and the Orioles ran away with the division while leading the majors in home runs, with 211. (The next closest team, Colorado, had 186.) The Orioles also pitched to a 3.44 earned run average, third in the A.L., trailing only Seattle and Oakland. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      But in their division series against the Detroit Tigers, the Orioles encounter a team with three former Cy Young Award winners in its rotation: Max Scherzer, Justin Verlander and David Price, all of whom ended the year on high notes. Showalter must hope that those pitchers are not at their best, because if they are \xe2\x80\x94 as he hinted in March \xe2\x80\x94 there may be nothing his brawny offense can do.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Then again, the Tigers must find a way to handle Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s winning formula. (They did this early in the season, taking five of six games from the Orioles.) Detroit has glitzier names on offense, as well as on the mound, but there is a reason Baltimore finished with a better record. The Orioles are a much better fielding team, with a sturdier bullpen, and Showalter expertly juggles a resilient collection of versatile position players. Photo        Credit             Illustration by Sam Manchester/The New York Times           To beat the Tigers, the Orioles should follow Boston\xe2\x80\x99s recipe for success in the last A.L. Championship Series: Wear down the starters, pounce on the bullpen, hit perfectly timed home runs and contain Miguel Cabrera. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense is not as patient as Boston\xe2\x80\x99s was, but the power is there, so they have a chance to become the first team managed by Showalter to win a postseason series.\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever our level is, these guys will seek,\xe2\x80\x9d he said recently, somewhat philosophically, as he looked ahead to October. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s comforting to me.

That was a misfire, but the Tigers recovered by swapping Miller to the Marlins in their deal for Miguel Cabrera, who became a two-time A.L. most valuable player. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 centerpiece also came in a lopsided trade: In February 2008, Baltimore sent starter Erik Bedard to Seattle for five players, including center fielder Adam Jones and the right-hander Chris Tillman, who will start Game 1 of this series.

Infielder Kelly Johnson joined their ranks in July, when the Yankees sent him to Boston in a trade. But still, like the others, Johnson had never been an Oriole. That changed on Aug. 30 when Baltimore traded for him, making Johnson the first man ever to play for all five current teams in the A.L. East.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  WINS AREN\xe2\x80\x99T EVERYTHING David Price\xe2\x80\x99s 4-4 record after joining the Tigers in a July 31 trade obscures his outstanding season. Price led the majors in strikeouts, with 271, and innings, with 2481/3. He also led in hits allowed, with 230, yet still posted his lowest WHIP since he became a full-time starter in 2009. He struck out 7.13 batters for every walk, the best ratio of any starter in the A.L. playoffs, and his 2.78 figure in fielding-independent pitching (an E.R.A. alternative that measures a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s ability to strike out batters while limiting homers, hit batters and walks) was the best of his career. Price has worked at least six innings in all four of his postseason starts, but he is 0-4 with a 5.81 earned run average in those games.NOTHING TO SHOW FOR TWO STARS Perhaps the most surprising sluggers on the Orioles and the Tigers are Steve Pearce and J. D. Martinez. They have something in common \xe2\x80\x94 both were cut loose from the Houston Astros for nothing in return. The Astros had Pearce for 21 games in 2012 before selling him to the Yankees, who gave him even less playing time and lost him in a waiver claim to Baltimore. Martinez was released by the Astros this March, then signed with the Tigers two days later. Pearce had 21 homers and hit .293 this season, while Martinez slammed 23 homers and hit .315. The two players combined to make about $1.2 million.COMMON ALUMNI The Tigers and the Orioles have shared surprisingly few impact players over the decades. Some who made their marks elsewhere (Eric Davis, Ray Knight, Fred Lynn) passed through, as did a Francona (Tito), a Ripken (Billy), a Storm (Davis), a Schu (Rick), a Groom (Buddy) and a Farmer (Ed). Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s Manager Bob Melvin played for both, as did the revered hitting coach Charley Lau. The Hall of Fame third baseman George Kell finished his career with Baltimore in 1957, and Whitey Herzog, the Hall of Fame manager, played for both. But the strongest connection probably comes from Al Kaline, who signed with Detroit as a bonus baby in 1953 out of Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Southern High School and went on to collect 3,007 hits, all for the Tigers.PLAYOFF HISTORY The Orioles and the Tigers won their last championships in consecutive five-game World Series \xe2\x80\x94 in 1983 for Baltimore and 1984 for Detroit \xe2\x80\x94 but they have never met in the postseason. The cities\xe2\x80\x99 teams have never met in the N.F.L. or N.B.A. postseasons, either. The Washington Bullets, who once played in Baltimore and are now called the Wizards, lost two first-round series to the Detroit Pistons in the 1980s. But that\xe2\x80\x99s way too complicated to count.

Part of that is because they haven't played since Sunday, but also because they clinched way back on September 16th and have only been playing a watered down version of Orioles baseball since then. But tonight they are back at full strength, playing in their second ALDS in the past three seasons. We're all hoping that this year they won't stop at the ALDS, and to do that they need to beat some very good starting pitchers for the Detroit Tigers. Tonight's match up is Chris Tillman vs. Max Scherzer, with Scherzer being the pitcher on the Tigers staff is the most imposing.    Max Scherzer     GS IP ERA FIP WHIP BA/OBP/SLG   2014 33 220.1 3.15 2.85 1.175 .298/.234/.368   Career 198 1239.1 3.58 3.39 1.219 .242/.304/.391    You've probably heard about the Tigers defense and how it's one of their weaknesses. It's something that the Orioles can hopefully exploit in the series, but Scherzer already does his own part to neutralize it by getting over a quarter of his outs via the strikeout. It's hard to muff a ball that isn't put into play, and he's one of the best in the league at racking up K's. The Orioles didn't have the pleasure of facing him in the regular season, but they faced him twice in 2013 and in 14 innings against them he got 20 strikeouts. (He also gave up four runs, a 2.57 ERA, if you're interested in that kind of thing.) When teams do put the ball into play against him, they most frequently hit fly balls, though the difference between those and ground balls (41.6% to 36.7%) isn't very big. Over the past few years he has kept the fly balls in the ballpark pretty well. At first that seems like it might be because Comerica Park seems giant, but he's actually had more trouble with home runs at home.    As you can see by his 220 innings pitched this season, Scherzer is an inning eater. He pitched at least six innings in 29 of his 33 starts this year, and he's capable of throwing well over 100 pitches in an outing. That's also how Scherzer helps keep the team in the win column; he doesn't give the bullpen much time to blow it. It worked, too, as the Tigers won 24 of 33 games in which he started.    Lefties hit Scherzer better than righties, though not enough that you should get excited about it. 13 of his 18 home runs allowed were to lefties, and they slugged .382 opposed to .348 for righties. Wow, .382! That's about the same as Nick Markakis. So is there anything to be optimistic about regarding Scherzer? Although individual match ups don't generally mean much, there are a few Orioles who have done well against them in their careers. Adam Jones is 9-for-18 against Scherzer in his career with two doubles and a home run, and Nick Markakis has also had some success, 5-for-15 with two doubles and three walks. And then there is Nelson Cruz, who has slugged .800 over 26 career at-bats against him.    Chris Tillman     GS IP ERA FIP WHIP BA/OBP/SLG   2014 34 207.1 3.34 4.01 1.230 .238/.298/.373   Career 118 680.1 4.00 4.51 1.296 .248/.313/.419    Chris Tillman started the only game that the Orioles won this season against the Tigers, and it was a beauty. He pitched 8 1/3 innings with just five hits allowed. One of those hits was a solo home run by Torii Hunter, which accounted for the only run in the game. Tillman has actually had pretty good success against the Tigers in his career, pitching to a 3.58 ERA over six career starts and 37 2/3 innings. Tillman has pitched better at home this season, which could be good news for today's game. In 18 starts at home in 2014, Tillman he'd opponents to a hitting line of .224/.277/.329. He gave up 32 earned runs at home in 113 1/3 IP (2.52) at home, vs. 45 ER in 94 innings on the road (4.31).    Tillman hasn't faced any current Tiger enough times to really warrant mentioning, but I'm sure it doesn't surprise you that even in small sample size both Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez have had a lot of success.

Although the Tigers hit three home runs to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 two, Detroit failed to execute plays when it mattered most and Baltimore took advantage, scoring eight runs in the eighth inning to turn a competitive game into a 12-3 rout at Camden Yards.Nelson Cruz, who hit 40 home runs in his first year with the Orioles, swatted a two-run homer in the first inning to start the power surge, and later hit a run-scoring single off Joba Chamberlain as the Orioles pulled away in the eighth, thanks in part to a fielding error by Andrew Romine, the Detroit shortstop. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The Orioles rapped out a dozen hits and went 6 for 11 with runners in scoring position as they chased the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 starter, Max Scherzer, out of the game in the eighth, then punished the Detroit bullpen for seven more runs.

But at some point in time it clicks.\xe2\x80\x9dThe clicking point Thursday came in the eighth. The Orioles sent twelve men to the plate, only two of whom faced Scherzer, and recorded six hits, including two doubles by Alejandro De Aza. With one out, De Aza doubled to right, and Chamberlain replaced Scherzer. Jones hit a playable ball to the left of Romine, who mishandled it, and DeAza scored. Romine chased the ball down in shallow left field and fired it home, too late to get the runner, then bent over in frustration. From there it got worse for the Tigers, especially when Rajai Davis committed another error. Photo       Alejandro De Aza doubled twice and scored in an eight-run eighth.  Credit             Patrick Semansky/Associated Press           \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a team effort,\xe2\x80\x9d Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn baseball, a team effort is, if someone makes an error, you hope the pitcher picks them up. If a pitcher struggles, you hope the lineup picks him up. Tonight, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it done. Up until that point in the game, it was a pretty good game.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s home run in the first was his 15th in 35 postseason games, 14 of those homers coming when he was with the Texas Rangers. The Tigers responded in the top of the second inning against Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s starting pitcher, Chris Tillman, as Victor Martinez led off with a home run to right field, followed by another homer from J. D. Martinez.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  J. J. Hardy, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 shortstop, powered a changeup from Scherzer over the wall in center field to lead off the bottom of the seventh and give the Orioles an insurance run that seemed important. Miguel Cabrera answered with a bases-empty drive to right field off Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day with two outs in the eighth to pull Detroit within a run.

Privacy Policy     Tillman retired 11 in a row after surrendering the two home runs in the second inning. But his pitch count grew high as the game went along. He needed 105 pitches to get through five innings, signaling the end of his night. Much of that workload was because of Ian Kinsler, the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 leadoff batter, who saw 30 pitches in his first three at-bats, including 14 in his third-inning plate appearance.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Kinsler proved even more troublesome in the eighth, when he got a leadoff infield hit against O\xe2\x80\x99Day. But he tried to steal second base with Torii Hunter at the plate, and Hunter lined out to Hardy, who threw to first base to complete the double play.\xe2\x80\x9cIan was on his own there,\xe2\x80\x9d Ausmus said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a hit-and-run in that situation.\xe2\x80\x9dGame 2 is scheduled for 12:07 p.m. on Friday, a quick turnaround for a playoff series, and Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s Justin Verlander will pitch against Wei-Yin Chen. During his pregame news conference Thursday afternoon, Orioles Manager Buck Showalter asked a moderator why the game was set so early, and he was told it had to do with the markets \xe2\x80\x94 four games are scheduled Friday, two in the Eastern time zone and two in the West.\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about our market?\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter asked.He was concerned that the fans in Baltimore might be unable to get to a noon game and provide the kind of electric atmosphere that energized Camden Yards on Thursday. The fans, most of them wearing orange shirts, were also given small orange towels. When they waved them, the ballpark was saturated in an Oriole-themed monochrome.\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care how much you do this,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said after the game. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do feed off that.

Patrick Smith/Getty Images/AFP (AFP Photo/Patrick Smith)More- Baltimore pinch-hitter Delmon Young smacked a three-run double in the eighth inning Friday to give the Orioles a 7-6 victory over visiting Detroit in the Major League Baseball play-offs.The victory gave the Orioles a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series. They'll try to complete a sweep of the Tigers on Sunday to advance to the American League Championship Series against either Anaheim or Kansas City.The Anaheim Angels were trying to bounce back from a game one defeat when they hosted the Royals later Friday.For the second game in a row, the Orioles secured victory with a scoring explosion in the penultimate inning.AFP "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Forever Young - Birds Watcher', 'First off, after Delmon Young\xe2\x80\x99s heroics yesterday I tweeted that what we had seen in from the Baltimore Orioles and their fans over the past two games represented everything that was right with sports. We saw a city that was squarely behind it\xe2\x80\x99s team, perhaps in a manner that it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done in years. And we not only saw a team that embraced the city back, but one that was determined to win despite any odds.Wei-Yin Chen pitched a couple of solid innings, but started to struggle the second time through the order. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 3.2 IP, 7 H, 5 R, 0 BB, 3 K. Chen mowed Detroit down the first time through the order, but five consecutive hits in the fourth added to his early exits. And given Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s ability to hit southpaws, Chen probably knew going in that he\xe2\x80\x99d be on a short leash. However, he did have an early 2-0 lead on Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 two-run homer in the last of the third. An instant replay review was inconclusive.Victor Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single cut that lead to 2-1 in the fourth, however Martinez would later score on J.D. Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer. Nick Castellanos would follow with a solo shot of his own, and Detroit suddenly had chased Chen and led the Orioles 5-2. However in a move that foreshadowed the ending, J.J. Hardy would keep the Orioles alive with an RBI-single to cut the lead to one.Kevin Gausman relieved Chen after his departure, and in his post season debut he did a great service to the Orioles and their bullpen by holding them over through the middle innings. The lone run he gave up was an RBI-double to Victor Martinez. However while at the time that looked to be an insurance run for Detroit (who led 6-3 at that point), it also came with a caveat. Famously slow runner Miguel Cabrera tried to score from second base as well, as he was gunned down at home plate. Adam Jones relayed the ball into Jonathan Schoop, who nailed Cabrera; that play swayed the momentum of the game, and perhaps the series.With one out in the last of the eighth Adam Jones was hit by a pitch, which sent an angry sentiment through the Camden faithful. Following a Nelson Cruz single, Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single scored Jones and cut Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s lead to 6-4. That brought J.J. Hardy to the plate, and with the game potentially hanging in the balance he walked on five pitches.  The passion at the yard was at a near frenzy by then, and the 48K plus in attendance could sense that something magic was about to happen as Buck Showalter looked at Delmon Young down the bench and said\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cgrab a bat.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Young\xe2\x80\x99s success in the post season is well documented, which is partially why Showalter asked him to pinch-hit for Ryan Flaherty. However I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure anyone in the crowd or in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout expected Young to get a first-pitch slider and for him to jump on it right away. In a moment that could only be called the inverse of the closing moments of\xc2\xa0Casey at the bat, Delmon Young sent a deep linerCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportspast the left fielder J.D. Martinez all the way to the wall.It was obvious from the get-go that the game was going to be tied. However as Hardy rounded the bag third base coach Bobby Dickerson made perhaps his best decision of the season and sent him home. The throw home was on line, but as Hardy slid into home plate and kicked up a cloud of dirt, he was emphatically called safe by home plate umpire Scott Barry.Without being overly melodramatic, it was a scene out of a storybook. And quite frankly, it was legendary. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that anyone who was even in the neighborhood of Camden Yards yesterday had ever heard it that loud. Delmon Young has been a role player and a pinch hitter for most of the season. But needless to say he cemented his name into Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 post season history with what he did yesterday. We won\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure where this moment stands in Orioles lore until it\xe2\x80\x99s put into the context of the full season. However needless to say, it was pretty special.Zach Britton somehow managed to tune out the Camden faithful with a cool head in the wake of that moment and closed out Detroit 1-2-3 in the ninth. The Orioles now head to Detroit with a 2-0 series lead, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll work out on the field at Comerica Park at 2 PM this afternoon. Game three of course will be at 3:45 PM on Sunday in Detroit. If the series has to go to game four, it would be at 12:07 PM on Monay \xe2\x80\x93 IF the Kansas City/Anaheim series is still on. (If that series has ended the O\xe2\x80\x99s would play at 1:37 PM.) If the series has to come back to Baltimore for game five, it would be at 5:37 PM. (If the Kansas City series is complete it would shift to 8:07 PM.)So bearing that in mind, I have a rare Saturday off \xe2\x80\x93 probably my first since prior to Spring Training.

On Friday, it was not a swarm of insects that buzzed his ears, but a mob of howling fans, 48,058 strong, needling him with their sarcastic cheers.Once a feared and dominant reliever, Chamberlain was a pleasant sight for Orioles fans, and they let him know it.Chamberlain, once a Yankee but now a Detroit Tiger, was the first reliever out of the bullpen Thursday in an eighth inning that turned into an eight-run debacle. The fans at Camden Yards, with their little towels waving in a sea of orange overhead, were hoping for more of the same.What they got was even better. Baltimore was ahead when Chamberlain came in Thursday, but on Friday, he started the eighth with a three-run lead to protect. He recorded the first out, but he let the next three batters reach base, and the Orioles rode another Tigers bullpen collapse to a 7-6 victory in Game 2 of their American League division series.

Detroit would not get that seventh run.In the bottom of the eighth, with the fans howling at him, Chamberlain got an out. But then, he hit Adam Jones with a pitch, and Nelson Cruz and Steve Pearce singled.

10/05/2014,"[('Orioles sweep Tigers, advance to ALCS - USA TODAY', ""Nelson Cruz hits a two-run home run in the sixth inning -- his second blast of the series.(Photo: Rick Osentoski, USA TODAY Sports)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREDETROIT --- Twenty-nine teams were scared off by Nelson Cruz's drug suspension and advancing age. The Baltimore Orioles were the 30th team and they are happy they took a chance on the 34-year-old designated hitter.BOX SCORE: Orioles 2, Tigers 1Cruz's two-run home run in the sixth inning off David Price snapped a scoreless tie and enabled the Baltimore Orioles to sweep their American League Division Series with a 2-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Sunday at Comerica Park.Cruz's homer was enough support for the Orioles' pitchers as Bud Norris and a pair of relievers combined on a four-hitter.Closer Zach Britton provided an anxious moment in the ninth when he gave back-to-back doubles to Victor Martinez and J.D. Martinez to start the inning as the Tigers got within a run but he held on to get rookie pinch hitter Hernan Perez to ground into a game-ending double play.The Orioles advance to the American League Championship Series for the first time since 1997 and will face either the Kansas City Royals or Los Angeles Angels beginning Friday night. Baltimore also won a postseason series for the first time in 17 years when it beat the Seattle Mariners in four games in an ALDS.Manager Buck Showalter won a postseason for the first time in four tries during his 16-year career. He lost in the ALDS round in 1995 with the New York Yankees, 1999 with the Arizona Diamondbacks and 2012 with the Orioles.Cruz was suspended for 50 games last season in August, when he was playing for the Texas Rangers, for a violation of Major League Baseball's drug agreement related to the sport's investigation of the Biogenesis of America antiaging clinic.Despite hitting 27 home runs and driving in 76 runs in 109 games last season, Cruz remained on the free agent market until after the start of spring training. The Orioles signed him to a one-year contract for $8 million and he responded by leading the major leagues with 40 homers while batting .271 with 108 RBIs in 159 games as Baltimore won the AL East by 12 games over the New York Yankees.In the three ALDS games, Cruz went 6-for-12 (.500) with two homers and five RBIs.Cruz helped the Orioles overcome season-ending injuries to two of their stalwarts, catcher Matt Wieters (elbow) and third baseman Manny Machado. Baltimore is also without Chris Davis, who is serving a drug suspension that will stretch through the ALCS.Cruz's homer came after Adam Jones singled with one out and was a lined over the right-field fence.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInAL Division Series: Orioles vs. Tigers\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Eight of those have come against the Tigers, including six in the 2011 American League Championship Series when the Rangers beat Detroit.In his first career postseason game, Norris allowed just two hits in 6 1/3 scoreless innings with six strikeouts and two walks. Left-hander Andrew Miller followed with a 1 2/3 perfect innings before Britton survived the shaky ninth for his second save of the series.The Tigers acquired Price from the Tampa Bay Rays on July 31 in a blockbuster three-team trade that included the Seattle Mariners but he fell to 0-5 in five career postseason starts. He lasted eight innings and allowed the two runs and five hits while striking out six and walking two.Detroit made it to the ALCS each of the last three seasons and the World Series in 2012 but wound up having a winless postseason this year, its first since 1907 when the Tigers were swept by the Chicago Cubs in the World Series.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE "", 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: A Fitting End to the ALDS - Birds Watcher', 'Oct 5, 2014; Detroit, MI, USA; Baltimore Orioles players celebrate their win in the locker room after defeating the Detroit Tigers in game three of the 2014 ALDS baseball playoff game at Comerica Park. The Orioles move on to the ALCS with 2-1 win over the Tigers. Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsThis 2014 American League Division Series ended exactly the way it should have. The way it was meant to.The last three outs of the contest between the Baltimore Orioles and Detroit Tigers featured a resilient bullpen, expert managing, and strong defense \xe2\x80\x94 traits embodied by the 2014 Orioles all year \xe2\x80\x94 as the Orioles completed the three-game sweep, marking the first time since 1997 the team has advanced to the Championship Series.Much like the Orioles, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t without its flaws, but it was exciting, and it gave the fans what they want. As manager Buck Showalter often says, it was delayed, but not denied.Closer Zach Britton stared deep into a sea of suddenly awakened, white towel-waving Tiger fans that had finally sensed blood in the water from a pitching staff that had held them silent all game.The first two Tigers hitters Victor Martinez and J.D. Martinez just hit back-to-back doubles off of his usually ironclad 97 mph sinker to lead-off the ninth inning. The lead was cut in half, from 2-0 to a very tense 2-1 with a man in scoring position and no outs. Momentum was changing. It was the moment of doubt.Then, the Orioles closer showed his meddle.Britton stuck out catcher Bryan Holaday on a low-and-inside sinker gaining the inning\xe2\x80\x99s first out.After that, Buck Showalter made perhaps the best of his many great managerial moves this series. Showalter walked the last dangerous Tigers hitter, Nick Castellanos, unconventionally putting the winning run on first base with one out in the ninth inning.But as so many things have this season, it played out exactly as Showalter thought it might.Zach Britton, who induces ground balls at a 75 percent clip, got the double-play ball Showalter desired. Pinch hitter Hernan Perez, a man who saw six major league plate appearances all year, rolled the ball to third base, setting up the play that would send Baltimore into ecstasy.The 5-4-3 double play that ended the game appropriately began with Ryan Flaherty, who has sured-up a defensive weakness at third base the O\xe2\x80\x99s had felt since Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s injury in mid-August.Then the turn was made by Jonathan Schoop, who made one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s biggest plays in the bottom of the third inning. Schoop tagged out Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Don Kelly at second on a controversial fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice where he held Kelly off the bag while retrieving a dropped J.J. Hardy feed before applying the tag.The throw went to now-everyday first baseman Steve Pearce, whose defense at a position he rarely played on the Orioles until this year has been both surprising and outstanding.Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s move wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about knowing the game. It was about knowing the guys on his team and his opponents\xe2\x80\x99 and putting his guys in a position to succeed. About sensing the moment, about reading body language, and capitalizing on an opportunity.Showalter refuses to be out-managed, and the Orioles refuse to be outplayed. The Orioles have responded to adversity several times already this postseason, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t give the impression that any challenge is too great. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Past, present, and future in Baltimore', 'When I was a youg kid in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s I spent a lot of Saturday mornings tailgating with my father and his college buddies outside of Byrd Stadium at the University of Maryland before football games. And in fact, we still all get together on occasion to renew that tradition at various sporting events. Nevertheless as great of a time as I had doing that, I always noticed a certain bitterness on the part of my father towards the entire \xe2\x80\x9cfootball establishment.\xe2\x80\x99My father grew up on the Baltimore Orioles and the Baltimore Colts. And as we know, the Colts were ripped away from Baltimore in March of 1984. If you ask my father now, he\xe2\x80\x99d tell you that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that big a deal to him and so forth. However in hearing his stories about the likes of Raymond Berry, Jimmy Orr, and of couse the great Johnny Unitas, as well as hearing stories from my uncles about how much all of them loved the Colts, I would submit that it was a big deal \xe2\x80\x93 at the time and now.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsSo perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat fitting that on the same day the resurrgent Orioles, long thought to be dead and gone, are going for a sweep in the ALDS, Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Ravens are in Indianapolis playing none other than the Colts. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that as much as some folks wanted the entire public to forget about the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 storied past for the better part of a generation, it was always there. The Orioles of course have won three World Series\xe2\x80\x99 to date, and between 1966-82 were the winningest organization in baseball. Throughout that time numerous hall of famers came through the dugout at Memorial Stadium, from Earl Weaver, Frank Robinson, Jim Palmer, Eddie Murray, Cal Ripken Jr., and of course the greatest third baseman of all time, Brooks Robinson.However as we also know, following two seasons (1996-\xe2\x80\x9997) of dominant baseball, the O\xe2\x80\x99s fell on hard times. And it was no coincidence that the time period was the same as New York and Boston being dominant. Literally, there was nothing that the Orioles could do right; whether it was hiring coaches, keeping players out of trouble, executing double-plays, or even having guys stay on their feet on the base paths. If there was a will to have something go wrong, there was a way. Again as we know, this futility seemed to be all the more loud when the aforementioned AL East rivals would come to Camden Yards \xe2\x80\x93 along with their fans. The Orioles would suffer the shame of hearing their follies cheered in their own ballpark by rival fans.Similarly as I said above, Baltimore football fans suffered when the Colts left. The warm relationship that the fans have with the teams was on display in the first two games of the ALDS, and that was also true of the Colts. It was during Colt games that Memorial Stadium got the nickname\xc2\xa0The World\xe2\x80\x99s Largest Outdoor Insane Asylumn.\xc2\xa0We all by now know the story of the Baltimore Colt Marching Band, and how they kept the fire buring for the city to get a team to come back. (And for the record, their act of playing the Colts\xe2\x80\x99 fight song on the State House steps in order to secure funding for new stadiums might have saved the Orioles from moving as well.) That in and of itself shows the love that this community has for it\xe2\x80\x99s teams.From Unitas, Berry, Robinson (both of them), Murray, Ripken, (Bert) Jones, to Lewis, Flacco, (Adam) Jones, Cruz, Markakis, and many more, Baltimore has seen it\xe2\x80\x99s share of great athletes over the years. So again, perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s fitting that today we\xe2\x80\x99ll see the past, present, and hopefully the future of the city\xe2\x80\x99s sports teams all coming together like a bowl of crab soup. The football team will take on the old football team, while the once maligned and spat on baseball team will attempt to take it\xe2\x80\x99s return to glory a step further.Incidentally, there\xe2\x80\x99s synergy between the Ravens and Orioles, just as there was between the Colts and the Orioles years ago. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always the case. So while one could argue that it\xe2\x80\x99s in fact Detroit who\xe2\x80\x99s hosting the doubleheader with the Lions and then the Tigers, I would submit that that city of Baltimore is getting a much more unique doubleheader today. Sports certainly has had a checkered history in Baltimore at times, however that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes today so special. The Ravens\xe2\x80\x99 two Super Bowls were sweeter because the city had lost NFL football once. And this season has been special to Orioles fans because of the 14 years of losing.And in both of those stories there lies a lesson in grit, bravado, and never giving up. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lesson that can be taught by the Baltimore Colt Band (now the Marching Ravens), as well as by the very concept of the\xc2\xa0Fighting Showalters. Whether the Ravens and Orioles win or lose today is irrelevant; the battle\xe2\x80\x99s already been won, and by the city of Baltimore at that. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Twice, he had the misfortune of guiding a club to the divisional round of the playoffs only to see a different manager take it to a World Series title the year after he left.The Yankees, who lost a division series under Showalter in 1995, won the 1996 championship under Joe Torre. The Arizona Diamondbacks, who lost a division series under Showalter in 1999 and fired him after an 85-77 season in 2000, captured a title in 2001 with Bob Brenly.All Showalter could do was accept that he had played some role in the teams\xe2\x80\x99 development, even if he could not celebrate with them. Now, though, Showalter, in his fifth year with the Orioles and his 16th as a big-league manager, is finally going to a league championship series, having earned his first playoff series win with a 2-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers. The Orioles will play the Kansas City Royals.

Mandatory Credit: Denny Medley-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are on their way to their first ALCS berth since 1997. Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s been \xc2\xa0a while.They will face a hot Kansas City Royals team that swept the owners of the best record in baseball, the Anaheim Angels. Built on strong starting pitching (like the Orioles), a strong bullpen (like the Orioles), and a speedy lineup (unlike the Orioles), the Royals present a very interesting matchup for the Orioles.The Orioles strong defense has been a vital part of their success in both the regular season and the post-season. The same can be said of Kansas City\xe2\x80\x99s ability to manufacture runs with aggressive baserunning.The Orioles and Royals were on opposite ends of the AL stolen base rankings for the 2014 season. The Royals ranked first with 153, and the Orioles ranked last with just 44.It will be interesting to see how the Royals fair on the basepaths, considering the strong throwing arms of Orioles outfielders and catcher Caleb Joseph.Joseph threw out just over 40-percent of base runners this season, and Nick Markakis and Adam Jones ranked in the top-15 in AL outfield assists (and that number could have been even higher, if not for their reputation halting many baserunners in their tracks).Will Jarrod Dyson, Alcides Escobar or Lorenzo Cain challenge the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 defense? Most likely, considering that\xe2\x80\x99s how they\xe2\x80\x99ve reached\xc2\xa0this point, and it makes no sense to deviate from that now.Whereas the Royals are riding their speedy legs and the hot bat of Eric Hosmer, the Orioles continue to ride the longball in their pursuit of their first World Series title since 1983.Like the stolen base charts, the Orioles and Royals are also on opposite sides of the home run rankings. During the regular season, the Orioles ranked first with 211 home runs and the Royals ranked last with 95 (the only team in MLB to fail to reach 100 home runs).The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 power-hitting lineup will face off against a Royals pitching staff that allowed the third fewest home runs in the AL (128). Like the Royals, it is unlikely the Orioles will deviate from their usual game plan.Orioles hitters will swing early hard, just as the Royals will run fast and often.Two very different schools on how to score runs on teams that have very similar pitching identities.The Orioles and Royals both had terrific starting pitching and relief pitching during the course of the 2014 season. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 3.43 team ERA and the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 3.51 ERA ranked third and fourth best in the AL during the regular season.Both teams lacking a true \xe2\x80\x9cace\xe2\x80\x9d pitcher has\xc2\xa0been constantly scrutinized\xc2\xa0by members of the national media, despite the effective pitching of James Shields and Chris Tillman. Whether they have an ace pitcher or not, they both have depth in their rotation and bullpen, with very few weak links.In fact, if the Royals can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to manufacture runs with their legs and the Orioles fail to get the long-ball going, the deciding factor in the series could\xc2\xa0likely come down to the manager.Orioles manager Buck Showalter is a magician when it comes to managing his bullpen, yes. The same, however, cannot be said for Royals manager Ned Yost.While Yost is a terrific manager in his own right, his bullpen management skills pale in comparison to Showalter.Though, it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to argue with the stats of the K.C. bullpen, it is also tough to defend Yost\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pull Shields in the sixth inning of their Wild Card game against the Oakland Athletics with two on and no outs for right-handed starting pitcher Yorando Ventura, who promptly gave up a three-run home run to the left-handed\xc2\xa0Brandon Moss.Despite that particular instance, it will be tough for Yost to make the wrong call to the pen with pitchers like Greg Holland, Wade Davis, and Kelvin Herrera.During the regular season, the Royals took four of their seven matchups against the Orioles. If their ALCS matchup proves to be as close as their regular season matchups, it is sure to be one of the more exciting series of 2014 playoffs.

The Orioles move on to the ALCS with 2-1 win over the Tigers. Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsAt the end of July when the trade deadline was approaching, I was travelling and listening on sports radio for updates and analyses. And with the news of the trade that involved David Price going to the Detroit Tigers, the consensus was pretty much that they were fully loaded with a formidable rotation for success in a short series. They were now the favorite team to win it all.The only thing the Baltimore Orioles did at that time was add an extra relief arm in Andrew Miller to a bullpen that was already well above average. Though it was acknowledged that he was indeed a good addition, the price was considered rather high \xe2\x80\x93 while not really addressing the concern of a starting rotation with no ace.In the final weeks of the season with the Angels holding on to the top spot with the most wins in the American League, it was becoming obvious that the Orioles were headed for a direct best-of-five collision with the Cy Young award trifecta of Price, Max Scherzer, and Justin Verlander.Really, what chance did the Baltimore Orioles have against this, even with the most powerful home run hitting team on the planet?\xc2\xa0 Good pitching stops good hitting, right? So great pitching should shut it down entirely.After Delmon Young\xe2\x80\x99s three-RBI double that won game two, I was really, really hoping for him to be the offensive star in game three. I had the article title in mind: \xe2\x80\x9cOne Delmon Young Trumps Three Cy Youngs.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Shucks!

How did this happen?The Tiger trifecta did not pitch poorly, especially David Price yesterday. Of course, the bullpen particularly killed Detroit in the first two games. And that was the obvious need for the Orioles entering the series \xe2\x80\x93 to get into the bullpen. They were able to do that twice, and in the final game the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a starter in Bud Norris who was one click and one pitch better than Price.Let\xe2\x80\x99s look and compare the two teams\xe2\x80\x99 combined starters statistics; and for this comparison I am also including a regular starter from each side who relieved \xe2\x80\x93 Anibal Sanchez for the Tigers and Kevin Gausman for the Orioles. So combine Sanchez with the three Cy Youngers, and combine Gausman with Chris Tillman, Wei-Yin Chen, and Norris.TeamIPRERHBBSOERABAAOrioles18.288163153.86.286Tigers22.11010184184.03.269\xc2\xa0So all in all, the statistics were fairly even between the starting pitchers of the two teams. It really was the bullpen that blew two games for the Tigers, along with some decent clutch hitting by the Orioles. It should not be forgotten that Adam Jones served a ground ball single through the infield just prior to Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x99 home run on Sunday.And over the series, the Orioles were 9-for-21 in RISP (.429), while the Tigers were just 4-for-15 (.267). This again demonstrates the fewer changes the Tigers had to score, while noting the Orioles better acumen at taking advantage of situations given them.But in the end, the two numbers that count are 3 and 0.BaltimoreOrioles3DetroitTigers0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('WRAPUP 1-Baseball-Sweeping Royals, Orioles eye World ...', '* Orioles, Royals start championship series Friday* Similar pitching strengths, contrasting offenseOct 6 (Reuters) - The fairytale Kansas City Royals and resourceful Baltimore Orioles completed sweeps of their American League Division Series on Sunday to set up an intriguing best-of-seven clash with a trip to the World Series at stake.The Royals, a wild card team making their first post-season appearance in 29 years, eliminated the top-seeded Los Angeles Angels with an 8-3 triumph to thrill their home fans and register a 3-0 decision in the best-of-five series.Earlier on Sunday, AL East-winning Baltimore also wrapped up their series without a blemish as they beat the Tigers in a 2-1 nail-biter in Detroit.The Orioles will host the Royals in the opener of the league championship series that sends the winner to the World Series.""We\'re fired up,"" said James Shields, winning pitcher in the Royals\' clincher against Los Angeles.

Martinez off closer Zach Britton, but he escaped with a game-ending double play.In the series, Baltimore overcame a trio of Cy Young winners in Detroit starters Max Scherzer, Justin Verlander and Price as the AL East champions advanced to the ALCS for the first time since 1997 in pursuit of their first World Series in 31 years.

10/07/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles Magic from soup to nuts - Birds Watcher', 'It dawned on me yesterday that Birds Watcher has the opportunity to boost readership, albeit perhaps only for a short period of time. There are a lot of fans out there who probably aren\xe2\x80\x99t very familiar with the Baltimore Orioles (or Kansas City for that matter) or Orioles Magic due to the fact that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the national following that NY, Boston, Chicago, or LA teams have. To anyone who might be reading us for the first time just to inform themselves about Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s team, welcome.The O\xe2\x80\x99s have of course had exactly three winning seasons since last appearing in the ALCS \xe2\x80\x93 2012, 2013, and 2014. However now it\xe2\x80\x99s almost as if they\xe2\x80\x99re back and better than ever. Many folks under a certain age probably only look at the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 organization as losers. And with good reason for sure; for so long it seems that this organization would only be in the news when they\xe2\x80\x99d commit a newsworthy folly against a team like Boston or New York. And to be clear, there were numerous along the way.However even before that, some folks might be surprised to learn that the O\xe2\x80\x99s were the benchmark for winning organizations from 1966-84. Nobody won more games at the big league level. The Orioles boasted the greatest third baseman of all-time in Brooks Robinson, and one of the greatest pitchers of all-time in Jim Palmer. (To be clear, many folks would submit Philadephia\xe2\x80\x99s Mike Schmidt as the greatest third baseman ever, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a valid point. However the begin all end all of that discussion is the fact that Robinson won 17\xc2\xa0consecutive gold gloves.) The Birds also won the World Series in 1966, 1970, and 1983.The Orioles are also a franchise of \xe2\x80\x9cmoments\xe2\x80\x9d as it were. Certainly the World Series winning moments are up there on lists of greatest moments, however there are plenty of other more ordinary things that qualify as well. In 1979 Doug DeCinces started what\xe2\x80\x99s now known as \xe2\x80\x9cOrioles Magic\xe2\x80\x9d with a walk off home run against the Detroit Tigers at Memorial Stadium. Legendary manager Earl Weaver stood at home plate in tears on the season\xe2\x80\x99s final day in 1982 as he retired. The 1989 \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not\xe2\x80\x9d season, which briefly rekindled the concept of Orioles Magic, and of course the closing of the venerable Memorial Stadium in 1991 were big time events.When Camden Yards opened in 1992 it became \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ballpark that forever changed Baseball.\xe2\x80\x9d And it was filled for some time \xe2\x80\x93 with Orioles fans at that. It probably reached it\xe2\x80\x99s peak during the 1995 season when the great Cal Ripken Jr. was chasing the consecutive games played streak. The most important and well-known game at the stadium occurred on September 6, 1995 when he played his 2131st consecutive game (a streak that would reach 2632 \xe2\x80\x93 still a major league record).But after that, there was very little to cheer about at the yard. Sure when teams like New York and Boston came to town the ballpark would be full \xe2\x80\x93 of visiting fans. However that rapidly changed in 2012 when the Orioles shocked the world and returned to the post season with their first winning season since 1997. That year the Birds also unveiled statues of their hall of famers at Camden Yards, with Adam Jones hitting a dramatic homer in the eighth inning of the game when they unveiled Cal Ripken\xe2\x80\x99s statue to give the Orioles the lead.But that was only an appetizer for this year\xe2\x80\x99s team. Free agent aquisition Nelson Cruz set the tone for the season when he homered on Opening Day at Camden Yards. The two snapshot \xe2\x80\x9cmoments\xe2\x80\x9d thus far at least have been the Orioles winning the AL East for the first time since 1997, and Delmon Young\xe2\x80\x99s bases-clearing double the other day to give the Orioles the lead against Detroit in the ALDS.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIn clinching the AL East, the Orioles exorcised demons held by fans from years ago. And perhaps the best part of an otherwise anti-climactic game was that the players seemed to get the fact that it had been so long for the Orioles fans. After briefly celebrating in their clubhouse with champagne and beer, the players continued that tradition out on the field in front of the fans \xe2\x80\x93 often including some of them in the celebration. Short of a World Series victory, that might not be something that\xe2\x80\x99s topped this year.And the Delmon Young three-RBI double; quite honestly that was a moment that any Orioles fan at Camden Yards that day will always remember. While I try to call these games down the middle for Birds Watcher as best I can, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest in saying that I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen something that dramatic in a game. And it all came together and happened in a flash, which is partially how Orioles Magic works.So this team is something really special to Baltimore right now. It\xe2\x80\x99s a team that\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly found a way to reconnect with it\xe2\x80\x99s fans after so many years in the abys. As I said, it\xe2\x80\x99s a story that everyday people should be able to get behind, as it\xe2\x80\x99s about as uplifting as they come. And the maestro of this great orchestra you might ask? WILLIAM NATHANIEL SHOWALTER. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: The New Tommy Hunter - Birds Watcher', 'If Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s new profile is legitimate, the Orioles could use him in the ALCS. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsTommy Hunter has always allowed home runs. In his first full season in Baltimore, he posted an astounding 2.15 HR/9 \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0the highest in the team\xe2\x80\x99s history. For his career, he owns a 1.42 mark in that regard, which ranks sixth among 322 qualified pitchers in that span. It\xe2\x80\x99s just who he is: a pitch-to-contact righty who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep that contact on the ground. Or is he?A funny thing happened to Hunter this year. All of a sudden, he induced a lot of grounders. 50.8% of the balls in play against him didn\xe2\x80\x99t go airborne; that rate easily tops his previous single-season high of 45.4%. Together with an 8.7% HR/FB%, that gave him a lower HR/9 (0.59) than ever before, which in turn gave him a lower FIP- (81) than ever before. Even without the notoriously-flukish home run-fly ball rate, he still hit a new high: His 85 xFIP- was the best of his career, and it came as the result of the uptick in ground balls.The salient question here: Will this last? The sample size certainly checks out. Ground balls stabilize pretty quickly, at only 70 batters faced, and Hunter pitched to 241 men last year. But that still leaves room for doubt, so let\xe2\x80\x99s look a little deeper.Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s sinker has always given him a solid amount of grounders, as do most sinkers. In 2014, he threw it more often (29.8%) than in any year prior, so that accounts for some of the increase. Most of it, however, comes from his 69.2% clip of grounders on the pitch, a level that dwarfs anything else he\xe2\x80\x99s posted. That uptick needs further explanation; we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep going.First, though, we should cover handedness, which comprises another striking characteristic of Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s 2014. Not only did he limit home runs, he did so against both righties and lefties\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 each hit two off him, in similar lengths of exposure (125 and 116 PAs, respectively). His ground ball rate also held even for both, at 51.2% for same-handed batters and 50.5% for opposite-handed batters. Compared to, say, last year, in which southpaws knocked out 11 balls while their counterparts stayed entirely in the park, this makes for a striking contrast.The aforementioned rise in sinker usage happened to a much greater extent for lefties (33.4%) than for righties (26.8%). The former group didn\xe2\x80\x99t hit as many grounders off it, though (58.5%, as opposed to 87.5% [!] for the latter). No, a shift in location drove the decline of their potency.To the zone profiles! Historically,\xc2\xa0lefties have demolished Hunter (in terms of power, at least) on pitches in, and pitches up. In his early career, he avoided the first area, but often strayed to the second, and found trouble when he did. This year, he made a new effort to pitch down to them, and located many more pitches in the zone because of it. The sinker saw an even more pronounced change, as its location moved much further down-and-away than it had ever been. Above everything else, this appears to have occasioned the new Tommy Hunter, and it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop any time soon.The Orioles will play the Royals for the first time on Friday. If that game \xe2\x80\x94 or a subsequent one \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0gets close, the Birds will call upon their vaunted bullpen to carry them to the Fall Classic. Hunter has no reason to not keep this up, and he can easily help the team in its quest for greatness.All data courtesy of Baseball-Reference.

They are first in home runs, whereas KC has less than half as many and rank completely in the basement in the American League.On the other hand, the Royals are a speed team. They led the league in stolen bases, whereas the Orioles were last by a large margin. Will this be a problem for the O\xe2\x80\x99s?\xc2\xa0 Not likely, as Birds pitchers hold runners well and catchers throw out stealers. And even with 153 swipes, that is still less than one a game.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 home runs average to 1.3 per game, and they account immediately for four bases and a score, whereas steals only advance a runner one base.What is interesting is that the two teams, though different, end up with relatively similar batting averages and on base percentages. You would expect the Royals to be a patient team at the plate unlike the aggressive, power-hitting Orioles who are 13th in the AL in walks. But in fact, the Royals had even fewer walks and were dead last in the league.Overall, there is an offensive edge to the Orioles, and it is bigger than just that they hit more home runs. At the end of the day, the game, the series \xe2\x80\xa6 it is about who can score the most runs. And the Orioles ranked three slots higher than the Royals in average runs per game.

There\'s going to be at least one team in the World Series this year that will have no logical explanation for its presence on baseball\'s biggest stage.The Royals were dead in the water in the AL wild-card game when they set fire to the unwritten rules of baseball and started stealing bases with a four-run deficit in the eighth inning.

Just ask Detroit manager Brad Ausmus if he felt like the baseball gods were kicking him in a very sensitive area at every turn over the longest weekend of his baseball career. The Orioles, meanwhile, got every close call and won the deciding game on a home run that should remind their fans of the razor-thin difference between Oriole Magic and whatever is the opposite of that.No good Orioles fan of a certain age can forget the night that 12-year-old New York Yankees fan Jeffrey Maier reached out of the stands in the right-field corner at the old Yankee Stadium and turned a routine out into a game-saving home run by Derek Jeter. It only took 18 years for some postseason payback when a Tigers fan caught Cruz\'s 331-foot home run in a similar spot at Comerica Park and then sheepishly dropped it back onto the field.If that moment wasn\'t proof that the Orioles have been blessed with that indefinable certain something this year, then the final play of the game should have been. Manager Buck Showalter threw baseball convention to the wind, ordering closer Zach Britton to intentionally walk the potential winning run in the bottom of the ninth and pinch hitter Hernan Perez bounced the next pitch to third baseman Ryan Flaherty to begin a series-ending double play.Showalter, who has said countless times that momentum is only as good as your next day\'s starting pitcher, explained after the game that he called for the walk because he wanted to change the ""karma"" of the inning. So there you have it.Even the guy who leaves nothing to chance and calculates every move to the fifth decimal conceded that there was something intangible hanging in the air at Comerca Park. The momentum of the series was in danger of shifting, so Showalter made a potentially controversial move to keep the fickle baseball gods at bay.Oh, he\'d tell you that there was all sorts of logic behind it. Britton is a ground-ball pitcher and the chances of getting a ground ball for a double play were about the same as a ground ball getting through the infield to tie the game. He\'d probably also tell you that playing for a tie there would be playing to lose, but we all know why the ball found Flaherty and not the grass in left field.The only question is what happens when an unstoppable intangible force meets an irresistible intangible object.The Royals have it going on, too. They\'re a good team with a lot of measurable things going for them, but they stole that victory in the wild-card round, and they found all sorts of ways to confound the winningest team in baseball in their AL Division Series.They have good starting pitching and a super bullpen. The Orioles have good starting pitching and great relief. The Royals led the major leagues in stolen bases, but hit the fewest home runs. The Orioles led the majors in home runs, but they had the fewest stolen bases.It\'s hard to separate them on paper, so the best-of-seven ALCS may come down to who has The Force with them.peter.schmuck@baltsun.comtwitter.com/SchmuckStopRead more from columnist Peter Schmuck on his blog, ""The Schmuck Stops Here,"" at baltimoresun.com/schmuckblog.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldPriest at once defended, excoriated1969 slayings of 2 women forge police-FBI liaisonA tragic case of contradictions Slaying: A father and daughter\'s first outing alone would be their last.

Mandatory Credit: Andrew Weber-USA TODAY SportsWith the elimination of the Washington Nationals by the San Francisco Giants 3-2 on Tuesday evening, there will be no Beltway Series this year. In fact, the Baltimore Orioles now remain as the team with the best record and the home field advantage throughout. The Dodgers were also eliminated by the Cardinals last night.What remains are a pair of Wild Card teams in the 89-win KC Royals and the 88-win Giants, the NL Central Champion Cardinals with 90 wins, and the 96-win Baltimore Orioles. The former three are teams the O\xe2\x80\x99s should be able to handle, but this is not a postseason where the favored outfits are performing particularly well. For example, the Nationals only scored nine runs on 26 hits in their four games (actually five games when you consider the 18-inning affair).But perhaps the most unlikely final four team is the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 next opponent, the Kansas City Royals \xe2\x80\x93 who have had even less playoff appearances than Baltimore in recent decades.Yesterday we did a comparison of the two teams\xe2\x80\x99 offences, giving the Orioles the edge in this category. And today we will compare their pitching and defenses.Here are some basic pitching statistical numbers, noting how each ranked in the American League \xe2\x80\xa6StatisticOrioles RoyalsStaff ERA3.43 \xe2\x80\x93 3rd3.51 \xe2\x80\x93 4thBullpen ERA3.10 \xe2\x80\x93 3rd3.30 \xe2\x80\x93 5thAvg. against.244 \xe2\x80\x93 5th.250 \xe2\x80\x93 8thRuns / Game3.66 \xe2\x80\x93 3rd3.85 \xe2\x80\x93 4thHR allowed151 \xe2\x80\x93 11th128 \xe2\x80\x93 3rdWHIP1.241 \xe2\x80\x93 6th1.259 \xe2\x80\x93 7thSO/W ratio2.49 \xe2\x80\x93 11th2.65 \xe2\x80\x93 8th\xc2\xa0The Baltimore Orioles have a slight pitching advantage in most categories other than home runs allowed. But of course, the KC pitching numbers are somewhat enhanced by playing 81 games in their ballpark, with the opposite being the case for the Orioles. The Royals are better at giving up fewer baserunners on walks. It will be critical for the Orioles to make KC hit their way onto base.Any way you slice this, both teams have very good, consistent pitching. Both teams used an unusually few number of starters (just six) to get through almost all of their games.Staff ace James Shields (14-8) had a 3.21 ERA, while young Yordano Ventura (14-10) was 3.20. Their worst starter was our old friend Jeremy Guthrie (13-11) with a 4.13 ERA while doing what he does best \xe2\x80\x93 eat up innings, with 202.2 on the season. They have a tough bullpen with three very good arms.If the Orioles have an edge here in pitching, particularly in a short series with travel days, it is very slight.Regarding Team DefenseA simple look at fielding percentages shows the Orioles to have a slightly better average at .986 to .983; however these numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t vary in the league from top to bottom enough to tell the whole picture.Baltimore was #3 in least errors committed at 87, while KC was #10 with 104.Looking deeper into the numbers, the Orioles ranked third in the AL in the category of defensive efficiency (percentage of balls put into play that were turned into outs) at .706, while the Royals were sixth at .693.But getting into advanced sabermetrics tells the better story here. Regarding the combination of total zone fielding (a variety of categories of statistics combined compared to runs saved by the defenses of all the teams) the Orioles were the very best with a score of 49, whereas KC was second-best at 30.Since the team speed of the Royals is a feature in this series, how will the Orioles be able to handle that? The O\xe2\x80\x99s were #4 in the AL in stolen bases against with 88. KC was #1 with only 69, but so what? In terms of percentages of runner caught stealing, the Orioles were #6 in catching 28%. But remember that this number includes Wieters with his early season elbow struggles, as well as Steve Clevenger and Nick Hundley. It could be that Caleb Joseph will play more because of his top-drawer skills in this category.Conclusions More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryOverall, as with pitching, the Baltimore Orioles have a slight advantage, while acknowledging that the Royals possess the same relative team strength. And yesterday we gave the Orioles an advantage in the offensive category.Though the Royals won the season series 4-3, those games were all played in the first third of the season when the Orioles were not at all the same team that they are today.On paper, though both teams played well in the final months of the season and through the playoffs so far, the Baltimore Orioles should have enough of an edge to win this series.

On a deservedness scale, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get much more even. The Orioles haven\xe2\x80\x99t won the AL Pennant since 1983; the Royals, since 1985. Remember the Bret Saberhagen, George Brett, Amos Otis, Dan Quisenberry bunch that beat St. Louis in the \xe2\x80\x9985 World Series?This is not expected to be as easy as sweeping the Tigers in the divisional series \xe2\x80\x93 but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expected to be easy, either. Remember? Three Cy Young Award winners facing the Orioles?The Orioles and Royals were third and fourth in the league in team ERA during the season, the Orioles at 3.43, the Royals at 3.51.The Royals held baseball\xe2\x80\x99s highest scoring team, the Angels, to six runs and a .170 batting average and swept the Angels in the American League Division Series. The\xc2\xa0Orioles held baseball\xe2\x80\x99s second highest scoring team, the Tigers, to 10 runs and a .218 average in a sweep of Detroit.Here\xe2\x80\x99s how stark the offensive comparison is:\xc2\xa0the Orioles were first in baseball\xc2\xa0in homers (211) but last in stolen bases (44). Kansas City was last in homers (95) but first in stolen bases (153). The Royals have stolen 12 bases in their four playoff games this year, and are 5-for-5 in steals against the Orioles this season,\xc2\xa0with Nori Aoki, Lorenzo Cain, Pedro Ciriaco, Jarrod Dyson and Alcides Escobar getting one each.On the power side, even though it isn\xe2\x80\x99t much, Alex Gordon has hit 8 home runs in 26 games at Camden Yards. Billy Butler has 28 extra-base hits against the Orioles, including 10 home runs. However,\xc2\xa0the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 projected No. 2 through 6 batters (Aoki, Cain, Eric Hosmer, and Butler) are hitting a combined\xc2\xa0.161 lifetime vs. Chris Tillman, the likely Game 1 starter for the Orioles.Delmon Young has 14 home runs in 346 at-bats against Kansas City, the most he has hit against any team. J.J. Hardy has 27 RBI in 41 games against the Royals and is hitting .301 lifetime against them. Nick Markakis and Adam Jones are hitting a combined .299 against James Shields, the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 expected Game 1 starter. Nelson Cruz has\xc2\xa08 homers, 29, RBI, 13 walks, and 42 strikeouts lifetime against the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 staff, and has hit only .209 against them. But he is hitting .333 with 4 homers and 8 RBI against Jason Vargas.Chris Davis should get a mention here. Buck Showalter confirmed on Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 105.7 The Fan today that Davis will not be on the ALCS roster.Davis\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0suspension still has five games to go, meaning he\xe2\x80\x99d miss the first five of this series. To add him to the roster just for possible use in Game 6, and/or the World Series, Showalter would have had to commit to playing a man short for the first five games against Kansas City. The other dilemma was that if Showalter had brought\xc2\xa0a player vote into the decision, that would force the players to tell a teammate, \xe2\x80\x9cSorry, but we\xe2\x80\x99d rather have Chris.\xe2\x80\x9dWould you want that job? Same token, would you want the job of telling Davis you\xe2\x80\x99d rather have someone else?The pitching comparison reveals arguments fairly equal on both sidesThe pitching comparison reveals arguments fairly equal on both sides. Bud Norris has a 0.68 ERA against KC in two starts, one being a 1-0 loss in May. Showalter has yet to announce which game Norris will start. Shields has 7 wins in 13 career starts at Camden Yards, his most at any road park in a nine-year career.\xc2\xa0The K.C. bullpen allowed just one run over 12 innings against the Angels. The Orioles bullpen allowed three runs in 12 innings against\xc2\xa0Detroit.So now that we\xe2\x80\x99ve given most of the key numbers, some courtesy of masnsports.com, and some courtesy of baltimoresun.com, what do they mean? Do statistics get thrown out the window in a series like this? Most of the time, they do.Logic would not have said the Royals would beat the Angels. Between the number of times Showalter uses numbers to make a decision, and a combination of gut feeling\xc2\xa0and karma, he has about the same\xc2\xa0success rate \xe2\x80\x93 a pretty good one \xe2\x80\x93 with both methods.As mentioned, the Orioles, although they won 96 games, weren\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to beat three consecutive Cy Youngs. Nor\xc2\xa0were the Royals supposed to take on the team with the AL\xe2\x80\x99s best record and track meet\xc2\xa0them to death in three straight.Lastly, reports are that Zach Britton\xe2\x80\x98s wife, Courtney, who has no career numbers against the Royals, gave birth to a baby boy\xc2\xa0Tuesday night in Burbank, Calif.

Orioles infield 2010-2014 - Camden Chat', ' As we live and die with every pitch, celebrate every win, and jump around in the stands (or our living rooms or favorite watering holes) after every playoff win, it gets harder and harder to see August 2010 in the rear-view mirror. Buck Showalter joined the club as manager on August 3, 2010, and Dan Duquette joined the Orioles in November 2011. While Buck had a head start of over a year, there\'s no doubt that Honey Badger GM has been the perfect partner in Buck\'s reclamation project.    So just how much has changed since 2010 in the roster construction? How did we get to this particular collection of players that has the O\'s just\xc2\xa0four wins from a World Series appearance? Let\'s take a look at just how we got to the current starting roster of the Orioles by tracing its roots in that 2010 roster that Buck inherited. We\'ll start with the infield. CATCHER            We\'ll start at the one position that\'s been one of the most stable - catcher. Matt Wieters was the starter when Buck joined the club in August 2010, and he was the starter until elbow surgery ended his 2014 season in May. Caleb Joseph and Steve Clevenger were rotated as his replacements until Nick Hundley was acquired from the Padres on May 24, 2014 for Troy Patton. Clevenger spent most of the rest of the season in Norfolk in AAA, while Joseph took over the primary catching duties, except for Chris Tillman starts. As Joseph\'s bat started to cool off in late August, Hundley saw more and more time as starter and caught two of the three ALDS games against Detroit. It\'s a shame Wieters lost most of a season that was off to his best start at the plate in his career, but Joseph and Hundley has provided almost adequate service in the batter\'s box, while Joseph has thrown out his fair share of would-be base stealers. This might be the only case where the October 2014 version of the Orioles is weaker than the August 2010 version.    FIRST BASE            Ty Wigginton was once an All-Star. In fact, that year was 2010. And while he made that All-Star selection based on his play mostly at second base to start the season, by the time August 2010 rolled around, he was entrenched as the Orioles first baseman. He picked a bad time to go cold at the plate, though, as Ty only batted .238 once Buck took over. That wasn\'t going to cut it.    Enter Derrek Lee in 2011, who had been a two-time All Star in his years in Chicago. He was one of two Andy MacPhail free agent signings to try and kick start the 2011 campaign, along with Vlad Guerrero. Neither worked out. \xc2\xa0Lee was traded to Pittsburgh before the year was out. So in 2012, the Orioles tried Mark Reynolds. The Magic Toe became part meme / part joke / part truth, as Mark\'s enthusiastic approach to defense at 1B led to some stretches that were both amusing and oddly effective. His batting average was not good, but his OPS+ was slightly above average and the man could take a walk when he wasn\'t hitting homers. This became a common trait among first basemen for the O\'s for the foreseeable future.    In 2013, the O\'s turned to former Texas Rangers farmhand Chris Davis, who had made a splash in 2012 by serving as the winning pitcher in a game in which he\'d started in the lineup and went 0-for-8 with 5 strikeouts. In 2013, no one was remembering Chris Davis the pitcher, but Chris Davis, the American League home run leader. He set a career mark with 53 home runs, finished 3rd in A.L. MVP voting and was intentionally walked an incredible 12 times. Davis started the year in 2014 solidly ensconced as the team\'s starting first baseman. But the stroke of 2013 didn\'t quite return. He hit homers - 26 - but a torso injury and his subsequent Adderall suspension took away a chance at returning to the lofty home run plateau he had reached the previous year. Problem was, he didn\'t hit much at all in 2014, with his batting average (I know, I know) hovering and even dipping below .200 for most of the summer. His 25 game suspension for testing positive for Adderall means he won\'t be on the ALCS roster, so Steve Pearce will continue as his replacement. Pearce has been an amazing story in his own right, returning from being DFA\'d by the Orioles earlier in this season to post career highs in home runs, game played, on-base percentage, and slugging. If Davis returns to the World Series roster should the O\'s advance, it will be as the third baseman, not the first baseman.    SECOND BASE            Oh, the tale of woe that is Brian Roberts. Now, don\'t weep too deeply for a man who earned more than $64 million playing baseball. But poor Brian never got to play in a single Orioles playoff game. While Roberts did start at second base for Buck\'s first game and win in Baltimore, injuries claimed most of his 2011 and 2012 campaigns (including a self-induced concussion from slamming his bat into his own batting helmet), and he and the Orioles parted ways after the 2013 playoff-less season. Robert Andino was the hero of Game 162 in 2011, and with Roberts playing just 17 games in 2012, it was left to Andino to be J.J. Hardy\'s double play partner. While his defense was just fine, he was horrid at the plate. His 2012 slash line was just .211/.283/.305/.588. He wasn\'t going to be the answer. Roberts recovered enough to start the 2013 campaign. And promptly got hurt the first week of the season, and didn\'t reappear until June 30. He ended the year batting under .250 with diminished range at 2B and a weakening arm, and the decision was made to part ways. Enter Jonathan Schoop in Spring Training of 2014. He wasn\'t promised the job - in fact, the O\'s seemingly had no plans to bring him to Baltimore to start the season. But he made the club, and after initially starting the year at third base to cover for an injured Manny Machado, he took over at second base and hasn\'t look back. The defense has gotten better (especially the footwork), the arm is a cannon, but the bat need helps. Right now, Schoop is starting due to his defense. Here\'s hoping for a few more timely hits as well in October. SHORT STOP            Cesar Izturis was the Orioles short stop just 49 months ago. Let that sink in. A mere four years has passed since J.J. Hardy was acquired in the winter of 2010 for two guys you don\'t remember. Cesar Izturis has an OPS+ of 51 that year. That\'s why he was gone in 2011.    Hardy\'s years with the O\'s haven\'t been as productive as we may have hoped - he\'s broken a 100 OPS+ just once, in 2011 - but his steady defense and veteran presence in an ever-changing infield has been needed. THIRD BASE            Miguel Tejada played for Buck Showalter. Bet you forgot that, didn\'t you? It\'s OK if you did - his performance was rather forgettable. It\'s not that Miggi played badly. He just didn\'t play well. And the former All-Star wasn\'t going to fit into the plans of a team trying to get younger, hungrier and leaner going forward. And thus Miggi\'s second tour of duty with the O\'s came to an end. (EDIT: Let\'s just forget this paragraph ever existed. As PaulFolk pointed out in the comments, Miggi was traded the week before Buck took over as field manager. Their paths missed crossing by mere days.) 2011 saw Mark Reynolds attempt to play third base. It didn\'t look pretty. Mark still took his fair share or walks and hit some homers, but that glove, eesh. No, that\'s not going to work. And thus Wilson Betemit was acquired to start the year at third base in 2012. And he made us yearn for the days of Mark Reynolds at 3B. So in August, with the season in the balance and the situation at third base quickly reaching an untenable state, Dan Duquette, Buck Showalter and the Orioles made a bet that would pay off in ways they could never imagine. They brought up a 20-year-old Double-A short stop named Manny Machado to play third base for the first time in his life. I think you know how that turned out. After 2012, the Orioles felt like the narrator in Fight Club - ""It\'s just, when you have Manny Machado, you tell yourself, that\'s it. That\'s the last third baseman I\'m gonna need. Whatever else happens, I\'ve got that third base problem handled."" Manny earned a Gold Glove and a Platinum Glove for his work in a season that unfortunately ended early. He suffered a season-ending knee injury in Tampa Bay in September. It would not be his last knee injury to end a season.    Manny got his left knee repaired, and while he missed about a month to begin the season, he started finding his stride in the field and at the plate around the All-Star Break. From July 7 until his second knee injury on August 11, Manny slashed .350/.387/.553/.941. And then, poof, in one ill-fated swing of the bat, and a right knee injury that mirrored the one to his left knee just a year before, he was done for another season. Chris Davis isn\'t the smoothest fielder, but he was probably the best option for the Orioles to cover for Manny\'s absence. And while Davis had his own issues at the plate, his walk rate and home runs were still showing up at a decent clip. Then, poof, he\'s suspended for Adderall usage, and he\'s gone. And so Ryan Flaherty slid over to third base. The former Rule 5 draftee has never quite swung the bats the O\'s hoped for when the took a chance on keeping him on the active roster for all of 2012, but he can catch and throw. And right now, that\'s about all the O\'s need in a third baseman. It was rather fitting he started the double play that ended the ALDS. Next up, we\'ll look at by far the most stable group of Orioles position players - the outfield.

They played for the first time in 1969 after the Royals became an expansion team \xe2\x80\x94 Kansas City won that very first game, then Baltimore took the next 23. ... Both squads will be well-rested (and maybe a little rusty) with four days off after finishing Division Series sweeps on Sunday. ... Shields, who pitched for the Orioles' AL East rival Tampa Bay from 2006-12, has plenty of experience against Baltimore. He was 2-0 with a 3.21 ERA in two starts against the O's this year and is 11-7, 3.52 ERA in 26 career starts, including two shutouts. Markakis, 21 for 71 (.296) with two HRs and eight RBIs, and Jones, 14 for 46 (.304) with a homer and six RBIs, have the most success against Big Game James. ... Tillman shut out the Royals in with a five-hitter in May, but he gave up 20 runs in four previous starts against them. Gordon has homered twice off Tillman in 13 at-bats. ... The Orioles did not face Vargas this season. In eight games against him, they are hitting just .224 (46 for 205). Cruz, in his first season with Baltimore, had four homers and eight RBIs while hitting .333 (10 for 30) for Texas against Vargas. ... Joseph gives the Orioles the best chance of slowing the Royals' running game. He threw out 23 of 57 potential base stealers this year. Hundley nailed only 5 of 27. ... Ventura struck out a combined 17 in two starts against the O's this season. ... The Royals are hitting .313 (47 for 150) with five homers against Chen in six games over his three-year major league career. Chen, a 16-game winner this year, held Kansas City to three runs in 12 1-3 innings in two games in 2014. ... Kansas City is just 9 for 46 (.196) against Norris. Still, Norris was outpitched by Duffy \xe2\x80\x94 relegated to the bullpen so far this postseason \xe2\x80\x94 in a 1-0 loss in May.___Big Picture:Royals: After ending a 29-year postseason drought, the Royals (89-73) continued their winning ways in the playoffs. They rallied twice in the AL wild-card game for a thrilling 9-8 victory in 12 innings against Oakland, then won their first two ALDS games on the road against the Los Angeles Angels in 11 innings on homers by Moustakas and Hosmer. That made Kansas City the first major league team to win three straight extra-inning playoff games. The series clincher was much easier, an 8-3 victory at home for a three-game sweep of the Angels, who had the best regular-season record in the majors at 98-64. ... The Royals also took the last three games of the 1985 World Series against St. Louis, so they've won seven consecutive postseason games \xe2\x80\x94 in a span of three decades. ... Kansas City wins with solid starting pitching, a nasty bullpen, daring on the basepaths and sensational defense. Baseball fundamentals. During the regular season, KC ranked last in the majors with 95 home runs but first with 153 steals. ... The speedy Royals swiped seven bags in the wild-card game against the A's, including one that helped set up the tying run in the 12th inning. Cain made a series of spectacular defensive plays against the Angels, also thwarted by Aoki's glove and the arm of reserve outfielder Jarrod Dyson. Throw in the clutch homers by homegrown hitters Hosmer and Moustakas, and the rollin' Royals certainly have some serious October mojo going under manager Ned Yost.Orioles: After clinching their first AL East title in 17 years on Sept. 16, the Orioles (96-66) coasted to the finish. Baltimore manager Buck Showalter provided position players with ample rest and gave his pitchers an extra day off between starts. Although the Orioles went 5-6 down the stretch, Showalter deemed keeping the team fresh more important than carrying momentum into the postseason. ... That strategy paid off in a three-game sweep of AL Central champion Detroit that put the Orioles in the ALCS for the first time since 1997. Baltimore is looking for its seventh pennant and first since 1983. Showalter, meanwhile, has reached the LCS for the first time in four postseason appearances. ... This is only Baltimore's second trip to the playoffs since 1997. The previous one, in 2012, ended with a Division Series loss in five games to the New York Yankees after the Orioles beat Texas in the wild-card game. ... Baltimore is still missing three key players. All-Star catcher Matt Wieters had season-ending elbow surgery in May, 3B Manny Machado had season-ending knee surgery in August and 1B Chris Davis is serving a 25-game suspension for using amphetamines. Davis would be eligible to return in Game 6 of the ALCS, but it seems unlikely Baltimore would put him on the series roster and be willing to play a man short for five games. ... Although the Orioles led the majors with 211 homers, pitching has been a big reason for their success. All four starters in the playoff rotation reached double figures in wins, and the back end of the bullpen has been solid, especially since Miller's arrival on July 31.___Watch For:\xe2\x80\x94 Lights Out Late. Both teams rely on stingy bullpens that were a key to their success early in the playoffs, so runs could be hard to come by in the late innings. Herrera left the ALDS opener against the Angels after five pitches with a strained forearm but tossed a scoreless inning in Game 3.\xe2\x80\x94 Cruz Control. A dangerous thumper all season, Cruz is often at his best in October. MVP of the 2011 ALCS with Texas, he owns a 1.059 OPS with 16 homers and 32 RBIs in 37 postseason games. Following the Biogenesis investigation, Cruz served a 50-game suspension last year with the Rangers for violating MLB's drug agreement. Then he spurned a $14.1 million qualifying offer from Texas and took an $8 million, one-year deal with Baltimore, plus available bonuses. He had a much better year than even the Orioles could have imagined, carrying a depleted lineup at times, but his power production tailed off during the final two months of the season. He turned it back on once the playoffs began, going 6 for 12 with two homers, five RBIs and four runs in the sweep of Detroit, which started three straight Cy Young Award winners.\xe2\x80\x94 Managing Expectations. At the helm of his fourth big league team, the respected Showalter has a well-earned reputation as one of the game's best team-builders and tacticians. It might seem he's wound pretty tight, but no small detail escapes him. Yost, on the other hand, was once fired by Milwaukee in the middle of a September playoff race, and some of his curious moves have drawn the ire of Royals fans. With both bullpens stacked and the benches often in play, this could become an interesting chess match.\xe2\x80\x94 Karma, Baby. The Royals believe this is finally their time. They were counted out for much of the season, languishing below .500 on July 22. They were counted out again in the wild-card game before two late comebacks. Perhaps the same karma that won them Game 6 of the 1985 World Series \xe2\x80\x94 the infamous Don Denkinger call \xe2\x80\x94 has reared its head for a franchise that was downtrodden for decades. But the Orioles also waited a long time to taste success, and they've relished the underdog role while overcoming one obstacle after another this year.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

Kauffman Stadium has the largest square footage of any big-league outfield; the Royals use that to their advantage with left fielder Alex Gordon, center fielder Lorenzo Cain and right fielder Nori Aoki all able to chase balls down in the gap. The Los Angeles Angels were continually frustrated by getting robbed of hits in the Royals\' American League Division Series sweep and the fly-ball hitting Orioles could meet a similar fate.The Royals stole a major league-leading 153 bases during the regular season and have 12 steals by eight players in four postseason games. The Royals are not afraid to use their speed at any time and will challenge catchers Nick Hundley and Caleb Joseph.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } The \'itis, and 6 other factors that could decide the Royals-Orioles ALCS***Why the Orioles? They led the major leagues with 211 home runs, and that plays well at cozy Camden Yards, where four games will played if the series goes seven. While homers don\'t come so easily at Kansas City, the Orioles have the type of hitters who can hit the ball out of any park, even Kauffman, with Nelson Cruz and Adam Jones in the lineup.Manager Buck Showalter is a master strategist, and seemingly every move he made in the Orioles\' sweep of the Detroit Tigers in the ALDS was the right one. While the Orioles don\'t possess a No. 1 starter like the Royals do in James Shields, they have a deep bullpen, and Showalter always seems to find the right reliever for any situation.***Don\'t forget about: Zach Britton. While Royals closer Greg Holland has been second in the AL in saves in each of the last two years, Britton converted 37 of 41 save chances in the left-hander\'s first season as a closer and also made good on both of his opportunities in the ALDS.***The difference-maker: Gordon. He is a fine all-around player, with power, speed and defense. The rest of the baseball world will finally find out about him.***In the end: Royals in seven. Kansas City\'s late-inning bullpen trio of Kelvin Herrera, Wade Davis and Holland shortens games, and its speed will put pressure on the Orioles.GALLERY: ALCS - ORIOLES vs. ROYALS***PROJECTED LINEUPSRoyalsSS Alcides Escobar (.285, 3 HR, 50 RBI, 31 SB)RF Nori Aoki (.285, 1 HR, 43 RBI, 17 SB)CF Lorenzo Cain (.301, 5 HR, 53 RBI, 28 SB)1B Eric Hosmer (.270, 9 HR, 58 RBI)DH Billy Butler (.271, 9 HR, 66 RBI)LF Alex Gordon (.266, 19 HR, 74 RBI, 12 SB)C Salvador Perez (.260, 19 HR, 70 RBI)2B Omar Infante (.252, 6 HR, 66 RBI)3B Mike Moustakas (.212, 15 HR, 54 RBI).OriolesRF Nick Markakis (.276, 14 HR, 50 RBI)LF Alejandro De Aza (.252, 8 HR, 41 RBI with White Sox and Orioles)CF Adam Jones (.281, 29 HR, 96 RBI)DH Nelson Cruz (.271, MLB-best 40 HR, 108 RBI)1B Steve Pearce (.293, 21 HR, 49 RBI)SS J.J.

You should really be sitting down. The oddsmakers in Las Vegas sportsbooks - specifically Bovada - have spoken, and the Orioles are now the favorites to win the World Series this year. Of the four remaining teams, the 11/5 odds for the Orioles are the lowest ones there.    The field is not far apart. Both of the National League teams, the Giants and the Cardinals, sit at 13/5 odds, while the O's ALCS opponents, the Kansas City Royals, have 13/4 odds. It could be that, if the O's advance to the World Series, they will no longer be favored against either of those NL teams. These odds may just reflect that the O's have a better chance of advancing while the books don't know who will come out of the NL. In the ALCS itself, the Orioles are 5/7 favorites against the Royals. That comes out to a -140, which is to say that if you wanted to bet on the O's in the series, you would have to wager $140 to win $100. Also, don't gamble, because the house always wins in the end. But it's fun that the O's are currently the favorites among gamblers all the same. Some other ALCS props being offered: Over/under on Orioles total home runs: 6.5Over/under on Royals stolen bases: 6Over/under on games going to extra innings: 0.5 (Over is favored at 2/3 odds)    They've got to get through the ALCS first, of course, but it's very interesting that Vegas likes them to do so.

10/10/2014,"[('Baltimore Orioles Host Game 1 of the AL Championship Series', 'Oct 2, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Chris Tillman (30) pitches during the first inning in game one of the 2014 American League divisional series against the Detroit Tigers at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsFinally the day is here for the American League Championship Series to begin with Game 1 being hosted by the Baltimore Orioles. It felt like a month between games before the Divisional Series began, and now it seems the same since the last time the Orioles played baseball.Hopefully the O\xe2\x80\x99s can take this playoffs to the end, and a great benefit for all of us out here will be the shortest offseason in practically anyone\xe2\x80\x99s memory. A day without Baltimore Orioles baseball now just feels so, so \xe2\x80\xa6 so wrong!Having said all of that, we might not get a baseball game today either. The weather does not look great. At this moment on Friday morning, the chances for rain in Baltimore at 8:00 tonight are 50%, increasing to 80% by midnight.Chris Tillman will of course be the Baltimore starter in Game 1.\xc2\xa0 For his career he is 45-31 with a perfect 4.00 ERA. The pivotal date in his history with the Orioles was July 4th of 2012. Prior to that his record was 7-15 with a fairly high ERA and maddening inconsistency. Everyone could see the talent, but it was not translating into much success.But on that Independence Day two years ago when called up from the minors, Tillman gave up just two hits in 8.1 innings in Seattle. He was a new guy completely. Since then, in 82 starts he is 38-16 with a 3.42 ERA.\xc2\xa0 He may not qualify as an ace, whatever that means, but he is generally very effective. Sometimes the early innings get to him and cause him to struggle to find a groove, as on May 1st of this year in the first game of a doubleheader against the Pirates \xe2\x80\x93 over 50 pitches in inning one. I was there that day; it was tedious. But he struggled through it, held down the damage to three runs in 4.2 innings, and the Orioles ended up winning the game.It was three games later on May 16th that Tillman started against the Royals in Kansas City. It was certainly his best outing of the season, as he held them to only five hits in a complete game shutout while throwing 117 pitches. It was a beautiful pitching performance to watch. At that point of the season his ERA was 3.34 \xe2\x80\x93 which equals his final ERA number at the end of the year. \xc2\xa0If you take out Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s two starts of only one inning each, his ERA for the season is 2.81.But then he got shelled the next game in Pittsburgh for eight runs in one inning. And then again just three weeks later the Rangers hit him for five runs in only one inning. If you take out those two starts that only went one inning each, Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s final ERA would be 2.81.The Orioles will be facing 14-8, 2.81 ERA James Shields. The bad news is that he has twice beaten the Birds this year, going seven innings both times \xe2\x80\x93 giving up a total of five runs on 12 hits. But again, that was in April and May when the Orioles were not quite the same team they are right now. Prior to this season, Shields\xe2\x80\x99 last previous start against the O\xe2\x80\x99s was in 2012.The J.J. Hardy DealBig news from yesterday was the three-year, $40-million extension deal for J.J. Hardy. Tell me you saw that one coming! No, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t, nor did anyone. The timing seems odd, but think about it. It creates a ton of good will going into the biggest series the Orioles have played in 17 years. The contract speaks of rewarding success and presents Baltimore as willing to spend money to keep winning.Hardy has hit for a better average this year, even if his power numbers have gone down. J.J. is among the best in the league at hitting with runners in scoring position. His defense is among the very best at the position, though he won\xe2\x80\x99t be a Gold Glove winner this season. With Manny Machado at third base and Jonathan Schoop at second, the Orioles have solidified the infield for three to four years to come. That is a good move. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('A.L.C.S.

Dyson, the Kansas City Royals\xe2\x80\x99 speedy reserve outfielder, had the outline of a four-letter word, in all capitals, buzzed just above his right ear: ZOOM, it says.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do\xc2\xa0tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Dyson said at Camden Yards\xc2\xa0on Thursday.\xc2\xa0He is probably not kidding. The Royals had the most stolen bases in the major leagues this season. The Baltimore Orioles, their opponent in the American League Championship Series, had the fewest. The Orioles, however, hit the most home runs in the majors. The Royals \xe2\x80\x94 you guessed it \xe2\x80\x94 hit the fewest.Contrasts don\xe2\x80\x99t get starker than that, but these franchises have one big thing in common: a decades-long yearning for a championship. The Royals have the most losses in the A.L. since 2000, and the Orioles have the second most. Both have built patiently for this moment, for a chance at their first World Series appearance since the 1980s.While the National League Championship Series features the familiar St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants \xe2\x80\x94 who have combined to win the last four N.L. pennants \xe2\x80\x94 the Orioles have not reached the World Series since 1983, and the Royals since 1985.

Credit             Lon Horwedel/FRE170538, via Associated Press           \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s great for baseball, just because you get some new teams in there, and you see the excitement in the crowds,\xe2\x80\x9d the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 Billy Butler said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think fans all around baseball are excited to see some new teams.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Both teams swept their division series, the Royals over the Los Angeles Angels, who led the majors in victories and runs, and the Orioles over the Detroit Tigers, who started three former Cy Young Award winners.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Royals hit only .198 against the Angels but found their power when they most needed it, with two homers apiece from Eric Hosmer and Mike Moustakas. Each hit a go-ahead, 11th-inning home run on the road against the Angels and another homer in the Game 3 clincher at Kauffman Stadium.Anything can happen in a short series, of course, and perhaps the Royals will take advantage of the cozy dimensions at Camden Yards and hit more home runs. Whether or not that happens, though, they know they will run. Photo       The Orioles agreed to a three-year contract extension with J.J. Hardy, a top fielding and home-run-hitting shortstop.  Credit             Nick Wass/Associated Press           \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s our game plan; that\xe2\x80\x99s the strength of our ball club,\xe2\x80\x9d Hosmer said. \xe2\x80\x9cTeams know what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do. They know we\xe2\x80\x99re going to steal. They know we\xe2\x80\x99re aggressive, and it takes a perfect throw to get our guys.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  With Matt Wieters lost to Tommy John surgery, that task falls to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 catching tandem of Nick Hundley and Caleb Joseph, a rookie who caught 40 percent of potential base stealers, the best mark in the A.L. Hundley is likely to catch Game 1 for Chris Tillman, who has allowed just two stolen bases the last two seasons, and Joseph said the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers are quick to the plate, whatever they throw.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve done such a good job at their times being fairly consistent with both the fastball and off-speed pitches, so there\xe2\x80\x99s not a huge variation,\xe2\x80\x9d Joseph said. \xe2\x80\x9cMost guys start getting slower times with the off-speed pitches, but our guys are really close. So you\xe2\x80\x99re not as pressured to call fastballs. Ultimately, if you continue to get the hitter out, then it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how many times he steals.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers had the A.L.\xe2\x80\x99s third-best E.R.A. this season, at 3.44, and the staff got even better on\xc2\xa0July 31\xc2\xa0with a trade for the left-handed reliever Andrew Miller. In 231/3 innings for Baltimore, including the postseason, Miller has 37 strikeouts and a 1.16 E.R.A. Photo       Thanks to late-inning relievers including Kelvin Herrera, the Royals are the second team (after the 1907 Cubs) with three pitchers with at least 60 innings and an E.R.A. lower than 1.50.  Credit             Charlie Riedel/Associated Press           Manager Buck Showalter deployed Miller twice in the division series, each times for five outs, and tends to be more unpredictable in bullpen usage, responding to the moment rather than adhering to strict roles. Ned Yost, the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 manager, tends to manage more traditionally, offering another contrast in a series with many of them \xe2\x80\x94 against a common backdrop.\xe2\x80\x9cBoth franchises are starving for a winner,\xe2\x80\x9d the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got two franchises that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been in that limelight. Now they\xe2\x80\x99re in it. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what can happen.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  EXTENSION FOR HARDY The Orioles took shortstop J. J. Hardy off the free-agent market Thursday by reaching a three-year contract extension, widely reported to be worth $40 million, with an option for 2018. Hardy, who could have been an option for the Yankees as they seek a replacement for Derek Jeter, has hit 86 homers in the last four seasons, most among major league shortstops, while winning two Gold Gloves.HISTORIC DOMINANCE The Royals\xe2\x80\x99 late-inning bullpen triumvirate of Kelvin Herrera, Wade Davis and Greg Holland was overwhelmingly effective this season, each with an earned run average below 1.50. According to Baseball Prospectus, the Royals are only the second team to have three pitchers with at least 60 innings and an E.R.A. under 1.50. The other? The 1907 Chicago Cubs, who used just eight pitchers all season and had little use for a bullpen, tossing 114 complete games. Photo       Moe Drabowsky, pictured in the 1966 World Series, pitched for both Baltimore and Kansas City.  Credit             Associated Press           DAVIS MUST WAIT The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Chris Davis is featured prominently in a billboard above the center-field seats at Camden Yards, but that is the only place fans may find him in the A.L.C.S. Davis\xe2\x80\x99s 25-game suspension for taking Adderall without a therapeutic-use exemption is set to expire after the first five games of this series, but the Orioles did not put him on their active roster. Buck Showalter said they did not want to play with a 24-man roster until Davis returned. Davis, an All-Star first baseman last season who now plays third, took grounders and batting practice during Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s workout.

Orioles closer Zach Britton took a red-eye from California, arriving here Thursday after the birth of his son, Zander. Royals center fielder Lorenzo Cain flew in from Oklahoma City after the birth of his son, Cameron. \xe2\x80\x9cI was crying like a big baby,\xe2\x80\x9d Cain said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad I was able to make it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  GOOD COMPANY Nelson Cruz and Frank Robinson both have 149 career plate appearances in the postseason. Cruz, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 designated hitter, has 16 home runs, and Robinson, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Hall of Famer, had 10. Robinson had a .532 slugging percentage in the postseason, almost identical to his regular-season mark. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s career postseason slugging percentage is .710, more than 200 points above his regular-season figure.SPENDING IN MODERATION The Orioles ranked 15th in the majors in opening-day payroll, at roughly $107 million, while the Royals ranked 19th, at about $92 million. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s franchise record is a six-year, $85.5 million contract for outfielder Adam Jones, who is signed through 2018. The Royals\xe2\x80\x99 record guarantee is $55 million, for outfielder Mike Sweeney after the 2002 season and for pitcher Gil Meche, who retired before he could finish the deal in 2011.  COMMON ALUMNI Moe Drabowsky was the winning pitcher in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first World Series game in 1966, blanking the Dodgers for six and two-thirds innings in relief. Three years later, on April 8, 1969, Drabowsky won the first game in the history of the Royals, working a scoreless 12th inning in a 4-3 victory over Minnesota. That game was started by another expansion draft choice, Wally Bunker \xe2\x80\x94 another Orioles hero in that 1966 World Series. Bunker pitched a shutout in Game 3, the first World Series game held in Baltimore. The first batter in Royals\xe2\x80\x99 history, Lou Piniella (he doubled), started his career with four games for the Orioles in 1964. Other notables to play for both teams include Mike Boddicker, who earned the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first victory in the 1983 World Series; Gregg Olson, who won the 1989 A.L. Rookie of the Year award as the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 closer; and Royals starter Jeremy Guthrie, who pitched five seasons for Baltimore, twice leading the league in losses.

Yet not once did the teams meet for the pennant. That changes on Friday at 8 p.m. at Camden Yards.

The Royals took an early four-run lead, and the Orioles fought back to even the score after six innings.

The suspense wasn\xe2\x80\x99t over yet, though. The Orioles scored a run in the bottom of the 10th and had two runners on base for the final at-bat. But the Royals held on for an 8-6 victory in Game 1 of the A.L.C.S., a contest so entertaining, even the losers could appreciate it.

Both teams kept fighting.\xe2\x80\x9dThe surging Royals, who won their first two games of the division series with extra-inning home runs, became the first team to hit three go-ahead home runs in extra innings in a single postseason. The Royals, who hit the fewest home runs in baseball during the 162-game regular season with 95, have seven in five postseason games.It was also their fourth extra-inning win in those games, starting with their wild-card victory over the Oakland Athletics.

Zach Britton, the Orioles reliever, walked three straight batters, throwing 12 consecutive balls before righting himself.He got Eric Hosmer to hit into a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice, and O\xe2\x80\x99Day, the side-arming right-hander, replaced Britton and he got Billy Butler to hit into a double play as the announced crowd of 47,124 roared its approval, at least for a short while.O\xe2\x80\x99Day also felt good walking into the dugout after that, and coming back out for the 10th. But his fortunes changed quickly, as Gordon struck on his third pitch, a fat 1-1 offering right over the plate.

The Orioles, who last competed at this stage for the pennant in 1997, swept the Detroit Tigers in the divisional round.

Kansas City would score three more times in the inning, even after Tillman came within inches of ending the inning with the bases loaded and only one run in.With one out, Nori Aoki singled to left field and Lorenzo Cain walked. Tillman struck out Hosmer looking, but Billy Butler singled to load the bases. The next batter, Gordon, worked a 2-2 count against Tillman, setting the stage for two more critical pitches in the at-bat.

So he did not swing, and the plate umpire, Tim Timmons, gave him the benefit of the doubt, calling a ball to bring the count full.Gordon then lofted a fastball into right field for a double as all three runners scored, and Gordon advanced to third on an error by Schoop as the Royals grabbed a 4-0 lead.

Jonathan Schoop walked against Brandon Finnegan and went to second on a single by Markakis, but was lucky not to be picked off. With Alejandro De Aza at the plate, Royals catcher Salvador Perez, who has a terrific arm, saw Schoop stray too far off the base and fired down to second. Schoop knew he would have been out there, so he broke for third, and Escobar\xe2\x80\x99s relay to Moustakas was wild. Schoop was safe at third.De Aza then placed a little flare perfectly over Finnegan\xe2\x80\x99s head, in front of Escobar, who dove but could not catch the ball.

Baltimore\'s blinked. Kansas City\'s \xe2\x80\x94 more specifically premier set-up man Wade Davis \xe2\x80\x94 provided the crucial turn in a game of alternating momentum swings that only became more rapid-fire as the game went deeper into the drizzly night.The touted Royals\' speed vs. Orioles\' power matchup was a wash. The bullpen battle wasn\'t. And Kansas City showed the added advantage that it can also do what Baltimore does best.""Everybody\'s doubting our power,"" says Jarrod Dyson, who in his familiar late-inning pinch-running role found himself caught stealing, only the team\'s second in 14 tries this postseason. ""It\'s good to have that speed in our back pocket. It\'s always there. But, last I checked, we\'ve hit a lot of bombs in the postseason.""The Royals have won all three of their road playoff games, all in extra innings, all on home runs \xe2\x80\x94 the first team ever to win three such games in the same postseason.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Alex Gordon leading Royals: \'He can do it all\'It\'s the Orioles who were first in the majors in home runs and last in stolen bases, precisely the opposite of the Royals. Yet, Kansas City had the game\'s only homers, Baltimore\'s the only two steals. Go figure.And if there ever seemed a moment when Baltimore was ready to deliver the quick-strike dagger it was in the bottom of the ninth after the Royals couldn\'t break a 5-5 tie despite loading the bases with no outs.But Wade Davis, pitching a second inning of relief for the first time since May 29, struck out Alejandro de Aza, Adam Jones and Nelson Cruz in order.""That really shifted momentum,"" says Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer. ""It was all on their side and Wade went in there and shut the door.""Davis knew he would pitch the ninth if the game were tied, but when Zach Britton walked the first three batters, closer Greg Holland seemed a cinch to take over with a lead.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } AL Championship Series: Breaking down Orioles vs. RoyalsNot so, with Britton getting Hosmer to hit into a force out at home and Darren O\'Day taking over and inducing a double play from Billy Butler.Davis had to regroup.""I was rooting as hard anyone was,"" he said. ""But I had to keep running up to the clubhouse to keep loose, too.""Davis\' second inning was perfect. O\'Day\'s wasn\'tGordon\'s winner into right field led off the 10th inning and gave his three hits and four RBI. Moustakas hit a two-run shot later in the inning off Brian Matusz.So, for one night at least, Kansas City showed it can also do what Baltimore does best. There\'s not much evidence the Orioles are going to turn into base path burners. Their two stolen bases Friday came when Jonathan Schoop was picked off second by catcher Salvador Perez but headed for third and was safe then the relay hit him on the back of the head. Nick Markakis trailed along from first on the play for the other steal.That set up the run that tied the game 5-5 in the sixth, merely setting up the main event.Both teams got here playing the underdog card, the old Little Engine That Could theme.But from the seventh inning on, they simply CAN.Even for the managers, it\'s more a matter of maneuvering to that point because they have the scripts down pat from there.Friday\'s six-inning prequel was a sometimes spectacular, sometimes shoddy but always intriguing mix of fundamentals and flaws, sliding catches and base-running blunders, big hits and bigger rallies.A dominant starting pitcher will be a luxury in this series \xe2\x80\x93 and neither team had one in No. 1\'s James Shields and Chris Tillman on Friday.The tie at the point they both were gone had enough twists to keep the wild Camden Yards crowd from even noticing the intermittent rain \xe2\x80\x94 10 runs, 25 base runners, the home team coming back from four runs down.Once the showdown began in earnest, the Orioles had the upper hand more often.The Royals are looking for that one opportunity, get a foot in the door and two feet on the bases \xe2\x80\x94 and just run. The Orioles didn\'t let them.Nori Aoki walked to lead off the Royals seventh against Kevin Gausman. Dyson, the one who spent Thursday\'s media sessions reminding everyone that the Royals are here to run and pretty much daring the Orioles to stop them, pich-ran.Track meet?Gausman accepted the challenge, throwing to first base five times with Lorenzo Cain at the plate. One throw nearly caught Dyson leaning the wrong way, the next one was so close that Orioles manager Buck Showalter came onto the field considering \xe2\x80\x93 but eventually eschewing \xe2\x80\x93 a replay challenge.Dyson finally went \xe2\x80\x93 the first time all night Kansas City even attempted a stolen base. Nick Hundley\'s throw got him, only the second time in 14 tries this postseason that a Royals runner was out trying to steal.Britton walked Alcides Escobar to lead off the ninth. Escobar created perhaps the most stunning development of the night when he produce the game\'s first run with a homer \xe2\x80\x93 he had three in 620 plate appearances during the regular season.But the Royals were plotting their more conventional method of winning. But Britton, who hadn\'t walked more than one batter in a game all season, loaded the bases on walks, including 12 pitches in a row out of the zone.But the bullpen made it an easy-chair finish for Yost despite the letdown in the top of the ninth. Once he got into his late-inning triumvirate, everything else fell into place. Kelvin Herrera got five consecutive outs to get Kansas City through the seven. Davis was perfect in the eighth and ninth.Holland\'s 10th could have been anti-climactic but after two outs, he allowed three consecutive base runners and had to get potential winning run Markakis to ground out to finish the game.Fitting because it\'s not likely this series will provide many anti-climactic moments.GALLERY: Orioles, Royals clash in ALCS     .oembed-asset-photo-image {         width: 100%;     } CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com'), (""Orioles on ropes after sluggers, starters can't go long"", 'Orioles closer Zach Britton walks off the mound in the ninth inning.(Photo: H. Darr Beiser, USA TODAY Sports)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE - Reset? Try regroup, too.The Baltimore Orioles knew they were headed to a different sort of baseball beginning Monday in Kansas City. What they desperately wanted to \xe2\x80\x93 and couldn\'t \xe2\x80\x93 avoid was facing a 2-0 deficit in the American League Championship Series.Finally, a trademark small-ball rally from the Royals in the ninth inning that produced two runs and a 6-4 victory, a fourth consecutive postseason road victory, a perfect 6-0 overall and the somber realization for the Orioles that their next home game could be in April.Alcides Escobar slashed a double over first base with one out in the ninth, scoring pinch-runner Terrance Gore to break the tie and it all goes west from there.The narrative for this series has been about the contrast in styles.Yet, neither team has thrived on what it does best.The Orioles have shut down the Kansas City running game. The Royals have pretty much kept Baltimore in the ballpark -- Adam Jones\' two-run shot in the third inning Saturday is the only Orioles homer in the series.Kansas City has one stolen base and that\'s been irrelevant to either result. Baltimore has cut down Jarrod Dyson as a pinch-runner in the seventh inning of both games so far \xe2\x80\x93once by each catcher, Nick Hundley and Caleb Joseph.Gore scored the winning run as a pinch-runner but he merely was sacrificed to second by Mike Moustakas and scored easily on Escobar\'s hit.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Royals perfect in postseason, take 2-0 ALCS leadThe game will change in Kansas City\'s more spacious ballpark, where there are fewer homers and more space for what\'s already been a remarkable string of outfield defensive plays from the Royals.The harsh reality for Baltimore is that what really needs to change is starting pitching.Only one Orioles starter this postseason has recorded as much as an out in the sixth inning, and that was Bud Norris, who won Baltimore\'s Division Series clincher against Detroit but was hit hard and often Saturday.Baltimore\'s starters have averaged 4 2/3 innings in their five games.""It changes the tempo of the game,"" says Orioles manager Buck Showalter, whose team has wiped out Kansas City leads in both games but has never led.The Orioles\' shortest outing of the postseason  was from Wei-Yin Chen, who starts Game 3 in Kansas City on Monday. Chen was knocked out by Detroit with two outs in the fourth inning of Division Series Game 2 but Baltimore won that day thanks to another Tigers bullpen meltdown.You can\'t count on that against Kansas City, which again deployed Kelvin Herrera, Wade Davis and Greg Holland to rule the final three innings.But if there ever was a day to make a dent on that Royal relief corps, this was it.Kansas City starting pitcher Yordano Ventura left two outs into the sixth because of shoulder tightness. He said after the game that he left as a precaution, didn\'t feel any lasting effects and didn\'t expect he\'s even need an MRI.  The four runs, five hits and three walks he allowed hardly made for an overwhelming performance but he was giving Royals manager Ned Yost what was needed most.Yost obviously was hoping to go as deep as he could with Ventura, considering Davis pitched two innings Friday and Herrera nearly two. Minimizing their work certainly would help going into Sunday\'s off-day.Rookie Brandon Finnegan finished the sixth and Yost boldly went back to his battle-tested formula for a second consecutive day in a tie game.When Herrera missed first base on what should have been the first out of the seventh and walked the next batter, he looked plenty vulnerable. He struck out Jones and then the Kansas City defense made more significant contributions.Nelson Cruz singled, but the reputation of hard-charging left fielder Alex Gordon kept Nick Markakis from even attempting to score from second and give the Orioles their first lead of the series.After Herrera got Steve Pearce on a short fly to left, J.J. Hardy sent a fly toward the right field line. But there was Lorenzo Cain, who already had made his mark with a diving catch in center field the previous inning.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Royals pitcher Ventura exits ALCS game with injury""There\'s such a difference in him from last year,"" Davis says of the 24-year-old Herrera not panicking in a tight spot mostly of his own doing. ""His approach is much less jittery now. I\'m not worried about him with that stuff. Now, he\'s getting movement on pitches that are already 100 mph. I\'ve never seen anything like it.""Davis hadn\'t seen anything like his own effort in quite awhile. He pitched more than an inning just four times this season and not since May 29. And each time he did, he had the next day off \xe2\x80\x93 at least three days each time he had pitched two full innings.But this is October and the way Davis is going, you can count Jonathan Schoop\'s two-out bouncing single through the middle as a rally. That\'s all Baltimore managed in the eighth.""I do all sorts of exercises all day to try to be ready,"" Davis says. ""And with crowds like this, you really push through.""And this was a road game.The Kauffman Stadium crowds probably won\'t be any more or less raucous, but the impact of offense changes with the next two or three games in Kansas City. If it\'s only two, much of this becomes moot in a hurry and we need to be more concerned about the Royals\' match-up with the remaining National League teams.But the Royals hitters like to remind you Kauffman Stadium is a factor in major league low home run total.""We play in a big ballpark,"" says Kansas City left fielder Gordon. ""Our ballpark kind of fits our team as far as pitching and defense and our speed in the outfield.  We like our ballpark.  It\'s not a home run-happy ballpark, but it definitely finds gaps and we hit a lot more doubles (fourth-most in the AL, seventh in the majors) than maybe some other people do.

But it is also the first with Derek Jeter as a retired player.Jeter, as the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 captain and a marketable champion, was famous in a way few ballplayers are. This postseason has offered a chance for some of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s most recognizable young stars to take the stage. But Mike Trout, Andrew McCutchen, Clayton Kershaw and Bryce Harper have gone home early.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Trout, let\xe2\x80\x99s not kid ourselves \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s the face of baseball,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam Jones, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 center fielder, said. \xe2\x80\x9cMan, the kid\xe2\x80\x99s unbelievable. He can play, flat-out.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      So he can, and Camden Yards is where Trout made his most gravity-defying catch, as a rookie in 2012, above the center-field wall. That is Jones\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhood, and this series gives him a chance to welcome more fans to it than ever before.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Jones dismissed the idea that he was even the face of the Orioles, citing right fielder Nick Markakis, who has been here two years longer, as the soul of the team. But of all the players in the A.L.C.S., Jones has the most All-Star selections, with four. Only 10 other players on the rosters have been selected even once.Fame is finding Jones. In the past month, he has appeared on the covers of ESPN the Magazine and Sports Illustrated (regionally, shared with a hockey player). He has 155,000 followers on Twitter and more than 82,000 on Instagram. He said he recognized that the players remaining in the postseason could showcase themselves, but his ambitions sounded more local.\xe2\x80\x9cWe were talking about the statues, the six out there,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said, referring to a conversation with Manager Buck Showalter about the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 greats in an outfield plaza.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cThey all have two things in common: First, they\xe2\x80\x99re all winners, they all got hardware, a ring; and they\xe2\x80\x99re all Hall of Famers. They won\xe2\x80\x99t make statues just for very good players. They\xe2\x80\x99ll make them for the greats. If you want to be in that, this is the time to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  People here know the super six without thinking: Brooks and Frank Robinson, Jim Palmer, Earl Weaver, Eddie Murray and Cal Ripken. Jones, 29, is not among their ranks and does not pretend he is. But he is the highest-paid Oriole (six years, $85.5 million) and perhaps the most charismatic. Fans feel as if they know him.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable sharing part of his life with fans, and that makes him unusual,\xe2\x80\x9d reliever Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not afraid to kind of put himself out there and let his opinion be heard, and he\xe2\x80\x99s proud of who he is. There\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of guys who are that comfortable in their own skin to do that. That sets him apart.\xe2\x80\x9dSo does his game. Jones is a good bet for roughly 30 homers and 100 runs batted in every season and has missed just five games, total, in the past three years. He has won three Gold Glove awards and plays a shallow center field \xe2\x80\x94 a sign, O\xe2\x80\x99Day said, of a player more concerned with saving pitchers from cheap hits than positioning himself for desperate attempts at balls sailing over the fence.

Jonesy\xe2\x80\x99s getting that ball and taking that hit away.\xe2\x80\x9dJones said his brother, Anson, had told him there was no method to his madness as a hitter. Some days, he comes to the plate hacking; other times, he waits for his pitch. Generally, though, Jones is aggressive, like most of the Orioles. He averaged fewer than one walk per week this season, with a .311 on-base percentage.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Jones\xe2\x80\x99s baseball role model also did not walk much, but otherwise they were different hitters. Growing up in San Diego, Jones idolized the Padres\xe2\x80\x99 Tony Gwynn and signed a letter of intent to play for Gwynn when he was the coach at San Diego State. Jones instead signed as a first-round pick of the Seattle Mariners, but he worked out in the winters with Gwynn, who made a lasting impression before he died in June.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cHe had fun playing the game,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jones, who sometimes blows bubbles while chasing fly balls. \xe2\x80\x9cHey, man, this game is frustrating as it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a one-man game; it\xe2\x80\x99s a team game. So he always told me, \xe2\x80\x98Do what you can do to impact the game, have some fun and live with the results.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9dThe Mariners drafted Jones as a shortstop, the position he played for three minor league seasons. He switched to the outfield in 2006, at age 20, and reached the majors. He was wide-eyed and eager to learn, said the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 Raul Ibanez, a teammate then.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Luckily for the Orioles, the Mariners flirted with contention in 2007, despite allowing more runs than they scored. Eager to build on a fluky season, Seattle traded Jones and four others, including starter Chris Tillman, to Baltimore for starter Erik Bedard.\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew that you lost a great player when you traded him,\xe2\x80\x9d Ibanez said.It was robbery for the Orioles and an opportunity for Jones, who said he first lamented the deal because the Orioles were so bad. By then, they had staggered through 10 losing seasons in a row, a streak that finally ended under Showalter in 2012. That season, Jones signed his contract and gave up free agency.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cI could have got more,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou test free agency, you can do whatever you want then. But what it was, was Buck\xe2\x80\x99s commitment. For some reason, me and him, we meshed right away. The second we met, our styles fit each other. A lot of people told me you get one great manager in your career, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re able to stick with him, stick with him.\xe2\x80\x9dShowalter said Jones made him laugh two or three times a day. In a meeting, he said, Jones once did a spot-on impersonation of him; Showalter was amazed that Jones could pick up so many details and mannerisms. He is smart, Showalter said, a keen observer who misses nothing and sets the example Showalter wanted when he took over in 2010.\xe2\x80\x9cThe way he played had to match up with what we needed him to be about, and it has since the first week I was here,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s made my job a lot easier.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Jones could make things easier for baseball\xe2\x80\x99s marketers, too, by leading a desperate team to the World Series.

You can almost see it coming: The Royals could sweep the American League Championship Series, sit around for a while and then crash back to earth in the World Series. The 2007 Colorado Rockies would get lots of phone calls from reporters seeking to make a comparison.The problem for the Baltimore Orioles is that the A.L.C.S. stops for only one day before resuming at Kauffman Stadium on Monday. The Orioles are down, two games to none, and never held a lead in Games 1 and 2 at Camden Yards. The Royals, meanwhile, are 6-0 in the postseason.\xe2\x80\x9cThe series ain\xe2\x80\x99t over,\xe2\x80\x9d the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones said near his locker after the game. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you guys are thinking it\xe2\x80\x99s over, why are we going to show up on Monday? We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of baseball to play in this series. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get back after it. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to go to K.C. \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99ve been a very good team on the road \xe2\x80\x94 so let\xe2\x80\x99s go there and have some fun. Eat some barbecue.\xe2\x80\x9dThe barbecue will taste great, but nothing else about the trip is certain. Even when the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers execute their plan, they have learned that the Royals are still apt to foil it.

It happened again in the first inning of Game 2, when Eric Hosmer broke his bat on a blooper just over the glove of shortstop J. J. Hardy, scoring two runs.

But as two-run singles go, this was maddening.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the pitch I wanted to make, an up-and-in fastball,\xe2\x80\x9d starter Bud Norris said. He added later: \xe2\x80\x9cGot to let it go; nothing you can control. We know we played a hard nine innings.\xe2\x80\x9dIndeed, the Orioles brought the winning run to the plate at the end of Game 1, and the tying run to the plate at the end of Game 2. They have fought back three times to draw even in these games but have never quite shaken the Royals.

If we can do that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a good spot. But a young team playing hot right now, they have all the confidence in the world. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to kind of put them into a corner a little bit, and that comes from scoring runs, getting the momentum on our side and then shutting them down.\xe2\x80\x9d Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story [{""headline"":""Sports"",""summary"":""Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, delivered to your inbox every week."",""product-code"":""SP"",""product-title"":""Sports"",""sample-url"":""http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/newsletters\\/sample\\/sports?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=SP&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up""},{""headline"":""Race\\/Related Newsletter"",""summary"":""Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with New York Times journalists."",""product-code"":""RR"",""product-title"":""Race Related"",""sample-url"":""http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/newsletters\\/sample\\/race-related?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=RR&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up""},{""headline"":""Your Money"",""summary"":""Every week, get tips on retirement, paying for college, credit cards and the right way to invest."",""product-code"":""MY"",""product-title"":""Your Money"",""sample-url"":""http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/newsletters\\/sample\\/your-money?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=business&contentId=MY&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up""}]      Please verify you\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

Privacy Policy     Britton walked the bases loaded in the ninth inning of Game 1 and said later he was surprised by the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 plate discipline; he expected them to swing more often than they did. It was a reasonable guess, because the Royals are an extreme contact-hitting team. Their hitters ranked last in the majors in strikeouts this season, with just 985. The next-closest team, Oakland, struck out 119 more times.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In this series, the strikeouts have been nearly even \xe2\x80\x94 17 for the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 hitters, 16 for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 hitters. But when Kansas City makes contact, good fortune follows. An infield single by the speedy Cain led to a run in the third, and another by Omar Infante led to the go-ahead run in the ninth, on a double by Alcides Escobar.

I threw some good pitches, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll wear the loss.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Royals have also hit home runs, another category in which they ranked last in the major leagues this season. It had little to do with their expansive home park, either; the Royals ranked 29th of 30 teams in homers on the road.At Camden Yards, though, they have flexed their power at critical points, just as they did in Anaheim, while sweeping the Los Angeles Angels in the last round. Escobar, Gordon and Mike Moustakas homered in Game 1 on Friday, and Moustakas homered again in the fourth inning of Game 2, just after Baltimore had tied the score.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cWe can swing the bats on this side,\xe2\x80\x9d Moustakas said after Game 1. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t always have to play small ball.\xe2\x80\x9d  But they still do that well, and for all the power he has shown in these playoffs, Moustakas was still asked to drop a sacrifice bunt to move the pinch-runner Terrance Gore into scoring position in the ninth inning on Saturday. He did the job, and Gore scored the winning run.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Kansas City Royals escaped yet another extra-innings playoffs game by beating the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday 6-4, giving them the 2-0 lead in the American League Championship Series.Kansas CityRoyals6BaltimoreOrioles4It was another frustrating game for the O\xe2\x80\x99s who battled back but could never get over the hump and take the lead. Having made a reputation over this season for the capacity to fight back, being unable to consummate it is vexing \xe2\x80\x93 both to the team and the fans who watch.The Orioles are hitting the ball \xe2\x80\x93 batting .291 over the two games. But the Royals are hitting even better (.329) and are doing so at more opportune times.It is difficult for the pitching staff of the O\xe2\x80\x99s to be constantly throwing from the stretch, and that is not far from the truth. The Royals have had baserunners in 18 out of 19 innings over these two games. Only the eighth inning on Saturday were they set down 1-2-3. By contrast, the Orioles have gone down in order five times.Frankly, the Orioles right now are playing a very good team that is performing at the top of their game. Alex Gordon and Lorenzo Cain are not just baseball players, they are good athletes. And Mike Moustakas has found a grove with a very pretty swing. These guys are good, they are making all the plays, and the ball is bouncing well for them as well. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got it goin\xe2\x80\x99 on.But the Baltimore Orioles have a great opportunity here to really establish themselves and this 2014 team as a historically great team. It would be even better yet if they could lose the next game and battle back from a 3-0 deficit.Has that ever happened before in the ALCS? Yes! In fact, it was a decade ago in 2004.With the Yankees leading the Red Sox 3-0, the Series turned when Boston hit a walk-off homer in the bottom of the ninth inning in game 4.\xc2\xa0 Three games later, the Curse of the Bambino was broken, and the Sox went on to sweep the Cardinals in the World Series.Why not sweep back on the Royals and sweep the Cardinals again?To do that, the starters are going to need to go deeper, and the Orioles are going to need some production from the fifth and sixth spots in the order \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Pearce and J.J. Hardy.So it could be the end, or it could be the beginning of the end \xe2\x80\x93 an ending that is epic.

Moustakas said he did not have a preference as long as the Royals won.But lately, Moustakas and the Royals seem capable of winning every possible way: through power, speed, defense or their stockpile of high-voltage arms.Moustakas showed his versatility in Game 2 by hitting his fourth home run in six postseason games and then laying down a perfect bunt that helped push the go-ahead run into scoring position with the score tied in the ninth.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Royals also extended their postseason winning streak to nine games, dating from the 1985 World Series, their last appearance in the postseason before this year. The last time they lost was Oct. 23, 1985, when John Tudor of the St. Louis Cardinals tossed a five-hit shutout in Game 4 of that memorable series.Three decades later, Cain went 4 for 5 with two runs scored on Saturday, drove in a run in the ninth inning and made two critical, athletic catches in the outfield.\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a game changer,\xe2\x80\x9d Moustakas said. \xe2\x80\x9cAny time he\xe2\x80\x99s in that lineup, he changes the game.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Afterward, both teams were packing up to travel West for Game 3 in Kansas City on Monday, which lands 29 years to the day since Game 5 of the 1985 A.L.C.S., the last championship series game played in Kansas City.

Even though Moustakas may currently be the most dangerous hitter on the four remaining teams, Yost didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him swinging away against the lefty Britton, and asked him to bunt.Yost is often criticized for his use of such antiquated devices as the sacrifice bunt, but he stuck to his methods, and was quite pleased about the outcome.

He was then shifted to right field in the next inning and robbed Hardy again, this time with the bases loaded and two outs, the score even.\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the keys is probably the two plays that Cain made in the outfield,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause he makes one in the center, then moving to right, and makes one there.

He left with two outs in the sixth with some stiffness and fatigue in his right shoulder, he said, but did not expect it to keep him from pitching again, if needed.Bud Norris, who pitched so well for the Orioles in the clinching game against the Detroit Tigers in the division series Monday, was not as sharp on Saturday. He allowed four runs and nine hits in four and a third innings. One of those hits was the home run by Moustakas, who tied Willie Mays Aikens for most home runs by a Royals player in one postseason. Aikens hit his four homers in 1980.

10/13/2014,"[('Open Letter To The Baltimore Orioles \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' Dear Baltimore Orioles, You Are In the ALCS!\xc2\xa0 How are ya holding up? I know it\xe2\x80\x99s been a rough couple of days. That\xe2\x80\x99s weird to say considering you\xe2\x80\x99re in the American League Championship Series, but these aren\xe2\x80\x99t normal circumstances. For starters, you won the AL East when practically no one outside of Baltimore gave you a fighting chance to do so. Of course once you do, people just shrug it off as a down year for the real teams in the East. You know, those Yankees and Red Sox \xe2\x80\x94 the guys with the money. The pundits figured you\xe2\x80\x99d just fade away in the ALDS to the Cy Young Tigers \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, the Detroit Tigers. But you swept them. You swept a playoff team and moonwalked right into the ALCS. Your City Loves You\xc2\xa0 Had to feel good huh? Those same critics hopping on your bandwagon and basically handing you a ticket to the World Series. The city loved you, the pundits loved you, and perhaps the world loved you. But What\xe2\x80\x99s Going On?\xc2\xa0 And then you actually played baseball \xe2\x80\x93 and you lost. Twice! At home! Now the bandwagon is empty and the pundits are saying you\xe2\x80\x99re done. Where have we seen this before? Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing that you\xe2\x80\x99re down 0-2 in the series. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you\xe2\x80\x99re dead. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you\xe2\x80\x99re out of this thing. The beautiful thing about baseball is that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end when you lose. You have to dust yourself off, put your cleats on, and get back out there for another game. You lost 66 games this season \xe2\x80\x93 2 more won\xe2\x80\x99t kill you. I Know You Won\xe2\x80\x99t Give Up And please don\xe2\x80\x99t think I believe you\xe2\x80\x99re giving up. I know you too well for that. You guys represent what Baltimore is all about. You\xe2\x80\x99re tough, gritty, and full of pride. You want this just as much as the fans want this. I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched the Ravens capture the hearts of the citizens of Baltimore over the past 20 years. But the Orioles have something the Ravens may never have \xe2\x80\x94 their souls. You saw the passion during the ALDS Series. You feel the energy when you walk around Downtown Baltimore. And now you get to take that passion to Kansas City. You have the opportunity to show the Royals and the rest of the country why you made it this far. \xc2\xa0 Chris Tillman isn\xe2\x80\x99t the best pitcher in the MLB, but he may be one of the smartest. He\xe2\x80\x99s never out of it, even when the bases are loaded with nobody out. Nelson Cruz swings the bat better than most men on the planet. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bullpen that can shut down the opposition. And you\xe2\x80\x99ve got stars in the outfield like Adam Jones and Nick Markakis ready to dive for any ball that comes their way. The talent is there to get the job done and you have the best manager in the business to show you the way. All you have to do is get out there and take it. \xc2\xa0 As a writer it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating reading other journalist count you out just because you lost a game or 2. But I quickly realize that their opinions mean little. If their opinions mattered that much, it\xe2\x80\x99d be the Red Sox playing the Royals, not the Baltimore Orioles. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s Time To Make Baseball Fun Again The games you lost in Baltimore were highly competitive and entertaining. You weren\xe2\x80\x99t skull dragged into submission. You weren\xe2\x80\x99t embarrassed on national television. You lost to a good baseball team \xe2\x80\x93 it happens. But now you get to the fun part. Now you get to take the pride of Baltimore with you to Kansas City and take the fight to them. You get to win at least 2 of the next 3 games in Kansas City to gain back the momentum. And then you get to come home and finish this thing. \xc2\xa0 The pundits may think the series is over but it\xe2\x80\x99s just getting started. But you already knew that.

""We\'ll see where we are.""He could go back to No. 1 Chris Tillman for Game 4 but he\'ll still need to use all four of his starters to come back and win the series.Yost said he probably will decide on Game 4 before Game 3 is played but noted that bullpen use becomes every bit as crucial with the potential of games five days in a row.""We pushed then a number of times late in the season to two and three days in a row and they responded fine,"" Yost said of closer Greg Holland and key set-up men Wade Davis and Kelvin Herrera. ""It gets a little more like regular season.""Holland pitched on three consecutive days four times this season and had a blown save in one of those third games. He even had a stretch of five games in six days and did not allow an earned run.Davis also did three in a row four times, allowing a run in the third game the first time he did it in April but cruising through the other instances. The Royals were more careful with the 24-year-old Herrera. He never was in three consecutive games and had just one stretch in May when he was in four games in five days and five in seven. The most notable effect for Herrera was three walks in the last of those games.Showalter had spread the workload among his set-up corps but closer Zach Britton, while pitching three consecutive days just twice, had seven instances of three games in four days. Of his four blown saves this season, one came in a third appearance in a row, another at the end of two three-game-in-four-days stretches about a week apart.For Baltimore, just easing the bullpen role in general will be crucial to staying in this series. Orioles starters have gotten as much as one out in the sixth inning just once in six post-season games and are averaging less than five innings per start.***The schedule for the remaining three games in Kansas City:Game 3, Tuesday: 8:07 ET start.Game 4, Wednesday: 4:07 ET start.Game 5, Thursday, if necessary: 4:07 ET start.Major League Baseball announced that fans holding tickets to Game 3 will use them Tuesday, and likewise for Game 4 and 5 ticketholders.GALLERY: Royals and Orioles in the ALCSCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Charming Home Seems Cursed for the Orioles', '     Supported by    Baseball  Charming Home Seems Cursed for the Orioles    Sports of The Times  By                       JULIET MACUR   OCT. 12, 2014     Continue reading the main story Share This Page  Continue reading the main story                  if (             window.magnum             && window.magnum.getFlags().indexOf(\'headlineBalancer\') > 0             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.shouldRun()         ) {             window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize();         }         Photo       The Orioles have hosted 16 playoff games over all since Camden Yards opened in 1992, winning only seven.

Then he would be ready to get the ball again for Game 6, he said, and close out the series with a victory here at Camden Yards.I wanted to believe them. Who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t? The Orioles had one of the better records at home during the regular season, going 50-31.

A baseball gem, Oriole Park at Camden Yards was the first of its kind: a stadium with an old-time atmosphere and modern amenities, all integrated seamlessly into the city.

Fans could see the jagged city skyline peeking from behind the outfield walls, and the Inner Harbor \xe2\x80\x94 with tall ships to see and crab cakes to devour \xe2\x80\x94 is a close walk.An entire city street was included in the ballpark\xe2\x80\x99s design, becoming a pedestrian walkway dotted by vendors hawking things from Polish sausages to Orioles pennants.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  While other stadiums were mostly all-purpose facilities, sterile and without personality, Camden Yards set the blueprint for nearly every new major league ballpark since.But it is not without one notable flaw: A statue of Babe Ruth outside the center-field gate was cast with Ruth holding a right-handed fielder\xe2\x80\x99s glove. Except that Ruth batted left-handed and threw left-handed. The error was caught too late to fix.

That year, he was sold to the Boston Red Sox and began his career in the majors.

The Orioles, of course, will say none of this matters. Forget that their chances of a win at home are about 1 in 10 \xe2\x80\x94 judging by past performances.  These Orioles are a positive bunch, the kind of guys who could be down two laps to the leader in the Daytona 500, one tire flat and front fender flapping in the air, and still believe they could cross the finish line first.

They along with their fans endured slight after slight both on and off the field. Throughout that time period and even well before it started, Kansas City\xe2\x80\x99s plight was ust as futile \xe2\x80\x93 if not worse. According to an unscientific ESPN poll\xc2\xa0taken before the series began, most of America is rooting for Kansas City.It seems that in America we love underdog stories. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that\xe2\x80\x99s right or wrong, but just as a matter of fact. So Kansas City is seen as this little team that\xe2\x80\x99s been awful forever and who\xe2\x80\x99s so deserving of a winner, while the Orioles apparently are seen as the villains standing in their way. Kansas City has the fun-loving bunch of over-achievers, and the Orioles have the souless group that might need a lesson in loosening up and having fun while playing the game.Okay, that might be exaggerating just a bit. But the fact is that America wants to embrace this Kansas City team as the lovable losers who will finally make it over the hump, and discard the Orioles back in the pile. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that should sit right with any Orioles fans out there. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s easy for Orioles fans to see the pain that they went through because they were in the middle of it. However keep in mind that the AL East is baseball\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent division; both winning and losing is ampified.Courtesy of Andrew Weber-USA TODAY SportsAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why I mention the fact that the O\xe2\x80\x99s suffered through slight after slight on and of the field. Whether it was being embarrassed on the field in games, having opposing fans take over their stadium, players such as Sidney Ponson finding themselves in trouble, or anything else, the Orioles suffered through some really bad years. And again, given the markets represented it just seems that things are louder in the AL East.This is not to say that some of that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to Kansas City as well. But Kansas City didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to go up against the NY, Boston, and even the DC media on a daily basis. The point here isn\xe2\x80\x99t to measure who suffered more or for longer. My point here is that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sit well with the Orioles or their fans to think that from the beginning of this series they were being seen as the team standing in the way of destiny for Kansas City. I think we saw some of that sudden success get to the heads of the Kansas City players on Saturday when Jarrod Dyson said that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to come back to Baltimore and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think the Orioles did either.  That\xe2\x80\x99s hardly the type of comment that one would expect to come out of the mouth of a humble underdog that\xe2\x80\x99s just happy to be here. Could one see Coach Norman Dale (played brilliantly by Gene Hackman in the movie\xc2\xa0Hoosiers) saying something like that?What Dyson did was offer the Orioles a life raft. It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to say that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to return to Baltimore. (Incidentally the proper response would have been something to the extent of\xc2\xa0we hope not to come back here, but the Orioles are a good team and anything can happen.) But to say that the Orioles themselves don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to come back to Baltimore is basically saying that the series is over. The implication there is that the Birds will simply roll over in these next two games, making way for the rightful American League champions to move forward.And if I\xe2\x80\x99m the likes of Adam Jones, Nick Markakis, Wei-Yin Chen, et al, I say\xc2\xa0NOT ON MY WATCH. The entire team should now be inspired to do everything in their power to ensure that Dyson personally has to eat his words. That\xe2\x80\x99s how sports works, folks. Whenever I hear something like that I see a player trying to be the next Joe Namath in trying to guarantee a win. My recommendation to Dyson would have been to say nothing and to just let his play and that of his team continue to speak on the field. But now the O\xe2\x80\x99s have a real inspiration to take this fight to Kansas City on their turf.For their sake, Orioles fans certainly hope that they accept the life raft thrown their way. The aforementioned Chen will get the start tonight in game three, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by former Oriole Jeremy Guthrie. Game time is set for just after 8 PM this evening.

Hardy (2) in game two of the 2014 ALCS game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles fans get offended and aggravated by the lack of respect given to our favorite team by the baseball media around the country, and rightly so. They fail to realize how, over a three-year period, the Orioles have won as many games as anybody.So O\xe2\x80\x99s fans should be able to understand any similar feelings from the fanbase of the Kansas City Royals.In the same way that baseball people around the country had gotten used to seeing the Orioles as cellar dwellers of the American League East, the same would be at least equally true about the Royals. We just don\xe2\x80\x99t expect them to be this good, because it has just not been a part of their recent DNA.So where did these guys come from? They are clearly more than just a wild card team that lucked-out a bit and backed into the playoffs. They are a good outfit! The Royals have been putting pieces together and, much like the Orioles, have been building a quality product over time.Showalter said of this process, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6you knew it was going to really get going. You just hoped it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t while you were there.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And yep, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got it going.There are some similarities between the O\xe2\x80\x99s and the Royals in terms of the development of their seasons. Both languished around the .500 level for quite a while, only to have a very successful second half of the campaign.For the Royals, they were still at .500 at the 100-game mark of the season on July 23rd. From that point until the end of the year they went 39-23. And the Royals are a team that can get hot. They had winning streaks of 10 games and nine games, and they won 17 out of 20 at one point. But it can also turn quickly, as they lost four in a row after the 10-game win streak.The Orioles broke out of a .500 rut just a bit sooner than did Kansas City. The O\xe2\x80\x99s last time was at 27-27, although 18 games later, it was just 37-35. But then the Birds began to win with more regularity.Here is a comparison of the last half of the season for both teams \xe2\x80\xa62014 SeasonOriolesRoyalsLast 104-66-4Last 2013-710-10Last 3020-1015-15Last 4026-1422-18Last 5032-1830-20Last 6039-2137-23Last 7045-2542-28Last 8053-2747-28\xc2\xa0Baltimore Orioles fans will remember from the first third of the season how difficult it was for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to win at home. It was so strange to see them play better on the road, with better hitting and pitching away from Camden Yards.But the Birds solved that problem, going 50-31 at home, and 46-35 away. The Royals never solved this issue, finishing with a home record of only 42-39. In fact, KC was outscored at home this year 342-300. So this can be some encouragement to the Orioles as they begin the first of three games there (weather permitting \xe2\x80\x93 which it does not look like it will permit).

Players have an extra day to fulminate over perceived slights from opposing clubhouses, and reporters are looking for material to keep readers clicking and turning pages.Enter Nelson Cruz.On a day when so much rain was falling that Game 3 of the American League Championship Series was postponed three and a half hours before the first pitch, something had to be discussed. And Cruz provided the day\xe2\x80\x99s best response to Jarrod Dyson\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the series would not go back to Baltimore, and that the Orioles knew it, too.Dyson made the claim to The Kansas City Star after the Royals won Game 2 on Saturday to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. Games 3 through 5 are in Kansas City beginning Tuesday.Cruz said he was not concerned by Dyson\xe2\x80\x99s confident proclamation, but when asked if he thought he was going back to Baltimore, he was unequivocal.

Privacy Policy     Ned Yost, the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 manager, who is as likely to instigate or inflame a smoldering controversy as he is to declare himself a messiah, said that he did not speak to Dyson or any of his players about keeping quiet in the future.Zach Britton, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 closer, cautioned that nothing Dyson said would force them to alter their game plan. The Orioles, despite being down two games, have played almost as well as Kansas City in the first two games, so why make changes?Britton said, as Orioles Manager Buck Showalter did Sunday, that the Royals had good reason to be confident. But he also issued a subtle warning, perhaps directed at Dyson.\xe2\x80\x9cThings can happen quickly in the games,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cso you don\xe2\x80\x99t let your highs get too high and your lows get too low.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story       We\xe2\x80\x99re interested in your feedback on this page.

So everything\xe2\x80\x99s moved up a day, with game three being tonight at 8 PM, game four tomorrow at 4 PM, and game five (if necessary) being on Thursday at 4 PM. Wei-Yin Chen will pitch tonight for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by former Oriole Jeremy Guthrie.Let me preface this by saying that I along with all of our staff writers here at Birds Watcher don\xe2\x80\x99t cover the Orioles as fans. Granted many of us grew up following the team and so forth, and it was that passion that led us to ink this column. However in this capacity we\xe2\x80\x99re analysts and not fans. Bearing that in mind, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be an Oriole fan to take umbrage at Jarrod Dyson\xe2\x80\x98s comments about the Orioles and their players.In the tradition of Richard Sherman of the NFL\xe2\x80\x99s Seattle Seahawks, Mr. Dyson has seen fit to let his mouth do his bidding as opposed to what he and his teammates do on the field. Keep in mind that Dyson\xe2\x80\x99s comments were totally unprovoked by anything that the Orioles appeared to do or say. He was asked if the series would return to Baltimore; it would have been perfectly fine for him to just say\xc2\xa0no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will. Instead, he also had to throw in that the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it would either.In doing so, he called the Orioles out and basically said that they had low-character guys. What he\xe2\x80\x99s saying is that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are feeling that the series is over, so they might not even be trying anymore. That\xe2\x80\x99s not something that should sit well with anyone in that clubhouse, nor should it sit well with Orioles fans who or course know their team and it\xe2\x80\x99s character much better than does Mr. Dyson. To their credit when they were asked to respond to Mr. Dyson\xe2\x80\x99s comments, none of the players nor manager Buck Showalter took the bait and fired backCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports(short of saying that they would compete until the series was over).Incidentally, Mr. Dyson could stand to learn a lesson in humility from the Orioles in that sense. Their character as a team and as individuals was called into question for no apparent reason, and they acted like the professionals that they are and didn\xe2\x80\x99t resond in turn. And there are a lot of people out there, fans and players alike, who would argue that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly part of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 problem.Mr. Dyson behaved in a carefree and quite frankly incredibly unprofessional manner in saying what he said. Heck, all Joe Namath did was guarantee victory; he never called into question the heart and will of his opponents. But in letting his lips flap as he did, Mr. Dyson also exhibited the looseness for which he and his teammates are noted. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the likes of Eric Hosmer among others do things in games that are probably over the line of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s famed unwritten codes.And honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99m not overly impressed by gesturing towards the dugout after getting on base myself. Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s a game that\xe2\x80\x99s as much about how you conduct yourself as anything else. But occasionally teams decide to throw caution to the wind in that regard. While they do celebrate after wins and so forth, the Orioles will never be caught gesturing towards teammates or opponents in that manner \xe2\x80\x93 not so long as a professional who leads by example like Buck Showalter is in the dugout, that is. And again, I would submit that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing; you never have to worry about violating the unwritten codes and ticking s.omeone off.But does that looseness and even arrogance give a team a mental edge? If what Kansas City has done in this series is any indication, perhaps it does. Either that, or perhaps the whole aura of professionalism hinders other teams (the Orioles in this case). However the hidden message in this is that teams such as Kansas City don\xe2\x80\x99t really care about the unwritten codes, and they feel they can still beat you even if you have it out for them.In the case of Richard Sherman with the Seahawks, he does and says what he does in an attempt to get guys off their game. This prompted Santana Moss of the Washington Redskins to say last week that Sherman knows that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t as good as he makes himself out to be, so he behaves as he does towards opponents in an attempt to gain a mental edge. So if that\xe2\x80\x99s true, is it not possible that Mr. Dyson might actually be questioning whether or not his team can keep up the pace at which they\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing?We can debate whether or not some of the gestures on the field or carefree schoolboy attitude exhibited by some Kansas City players is disrespectful, or whether or not that helps them to outduel the very professional group of Orioles. However one thing that\xe2\x80\x99s not really up for debate is the fact that Mr. Dyson embarrassed himself, his team, his manager, and his fans when he made his comments. It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to be confident, but quite another to in effect say that your opponent has thrown in the towel. And reading between the lines, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he said.Some of the crasser individuals will make comments such as\xc2\xa0well he\xe2\x80\x99s right when he says they won\xe2\x80\x99t go back to Baltimore. And he might well be for all I know. However no matter where you stand, the idea that his comments could be used as bulletin board material has to cross your mind. And bearing that in mind, there has to be a few people out there who would like to see the Baltimore Orioles teach Mr. Dyson the ultimate lesson in humility.

""You can talk about this or that but we gotta win.""The Orioles fell behind three-games-to-none in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series with a 2-1 loss to the Kansas City Royals in Game 3 at Kauffman Stadium.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } One task left for Royals: \'Go out there and win it\'The Royals will look to sweep the series Wednesday in Game 4, which is scheduled to start at 4:07 p.m. ET.The only way the Orioles are going to get to the World Series for the first time in more than three decades is to channel the 2004 Boston Red Sox. That was the only team in major league history to rally from a 3-0 deficit to win a best-of-seven postseason season, stunning the New York Yankees in the ALCS.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Royals one win from World Series, lead ALCS 3-0The toughest part of this series for the Orioles is they could be up 3-0 and one win away from their first World Series trip since 1983 when they beat the Philadelphia Phillies in five games.The Orioles lost 8-6 in 10 innings in Game 1 last Friday then 6-4 in Game 2 a day later when the Royals rallied for two runs in the top of the ninth. Game 3 was decided by one run, Billy Butler breaking a 1-1 tie in the sixth inning with a sacrifice fly.Orioles first baseman Steve Pearce admits he finds it hard not to wonder if Baltimore has come against a team of destiny. The Royals are 7-0 in their first postseason appearance since 1983, the 29-year wait representing what had been the longest current drought in major North American professional team sports.""It just seems like they\'re riding that wave right now,"" Pearce said. ""It just seems like everything is going their way. We\'re playing well and we\'re in every game but it hasn\'t been enough. When a team is riding that way, they\'re tough to beat.""The Orioles refuse to say they are frustrated, though. In fact, manager Buck Showalter holds firm to the belief his team will somehow find a way to match those Red Sox of a decade ago.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Mike Moustakas makes unreal diving catch into the stands""Always feel like the momentum can change,"" Showalter said. ""If we can get one (win) under our belt and get a few things to work out our way, we can get it spinning the other way. Otherwise, we shouldn\'t show up.""I know what our guys in our locker room feel like. They know they\'re up against some good competition. But always one more opportunity away. We\'ll sleep fast, and our guys will be ready.""Showalter is confident enough is his Orioles that he decided not to use his top starter, right-hander Chris Tillman, to pitch Game 4 on regular four days of rest. Instead, right-hander Miguel Gonzalez will start in what will be his first game action since working five innings Sept. 28 in the regular-season finale against the Toronto Blue Jays.""Gonzalez has pitched some big games for us and especially on the road and tough spots,"" Showalter said.Gonzalez is 6-4 with a 3.27 ERA in 14 road starts this year. None, though, has been as important as the one he will make in Game 4.GALLERY: ALCS - ROYALS vs. ORIOLESCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com')]"
