03/03/2015,"[('Orioles Grapefruit League Opening Game Thread: vs. Tigers ...', "" If a Major League Baseball game takes place but it isn't on TV or radio, did it really happen? We must ponder this question today as the Orioles open up the Grapefruit League season with a game against the Tigers. They are opening on the road in the Tigers' spring complex in Lakeland, which means no MASN and no 105.7 FM. If you'd like to follow the game, you need to either have a way to listen to 97.1 FM out of Detroit, or MLB's Gameday Audio.    Or you can keep tabs here, along with those among your Orioles fan compatriots who are sifting through the same four beat writers tweeting the same four descriptions of every play in the game. Hey, it beats thinking about yet another wintry mix going on outside in the Baltimore area, doesn't it? Ubaldo Jimenez is scheduled to be the Orioles starting pitcher, though he'll only throw two innings because that's what you do in your first outing of the spring. Steve Johnson is\xc2\xa0also scheduled to pitch. The others haven't been announced. Minor league pitcher Mychal Givens, who is not a camp invitee, will be among those making the trip to Lakeland just in case. Position players who are along for the ride include Drew Dosch, the 2013 7th round pick, and former Ranger Julio Borbon.    Here are your starting lineups for the game, although spring training being spring training, don't expect to see them for long. That's easy since unless you're in Lakeland you won't see them at all, but you know what I mean.    Lineup     BALTIMORE ORIOLES DETROIT TIGERS      Everth Cabrera - SS  Rajai Davis - RF    Jonathan Schoop - 2B  Alex Avila - C    Nolan Reimold - RF  Ian Kinsler - 2B    Matt Tuiasosopo - DH  Yoenis Cespedes - LF    Travis Snider - LF  Nick Castellanos - 3B    Jimmy Paredes - 3B  Tyler Collins - DH    J.P.

If you have observed or participated on Camden Chat for a long time, you surely know that in the event the team wins a game, the assembled commentariat proceeds to spell out O! R! I! O! L! E! S! As in the song Orioles Magic. Since these games are only exhibitions, if it should turn out the Orioles win, only spell them out using lower case letters. If it doesn't count, there's no point shouting.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsRule 5 Selection Jason Garcia excels and is kept \xe2\x80\xa6The buzz surrounding Rule 5 selection Jason Garcia is palpable, all of the way to Maryland. Though he has never pitched higher than A-level baseball, he has velocity and \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d that simply can\xe2\x80\x99t be taught.In the intra-squad game on Sunday, he was clearly the one pitcher that stood out in the comments of all who were there. He fanned Nolan Reimold and Matt Tuiasosopo, while getting Ryan Lavarnway to fly out to center.For better or worse, the Baltimore Orioles are fascinated with Rule 5 players. And though conventional wisdom would seem to dictate that the odds of Garcia or Logan Verrett actually sticking with a defending AL East champion team are very long, the temptation to land a great talent for a cheap price may be too much to pass up.I am betting that Garcia makes the team and is kept, at least for the early portion of the season and for as long as he pitches well.Next: Orioles hit by pitch ... a lot ...Next7 of 8PrevUse your \xe2\x86\x90 \xe2\x86\x92 (arrows) to browse  var tpsInstance;var tpsOptions = {""slideContainer"":""#tps_slideContainer_36481"",""nav"":["".theiaPostSlider_nav""],""navText"":""%{currentSlide} of %{totalSlides}"",""helperText"":""Use your \\u2190 \\u2192 (arrows) to browse"",""defaultSlide"":6,""transitionEffect"":""simple"",""transitionSpeed"":200,""keyboardShortcuts"":true,""numberOfSlides"":8,""slides"":[{""title"":""Baltimore Orioles Spring Training: Six Bold Predictions - Page 7"",""permalink"":""http:\\/\\/thebaltimorewire.com\\/2015\\/03\\/03\\/baltimore-orioles-spring-training-six-bold-predictions\\/"",""shortCodeTitle"":null,""content"":""<div id=\\""attachment_36518\\""  class=\\""wp-caption aligncenter\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2015\\/03\\/mlb-baltimore-orioles-workout.jpg\\""><img class=\\""size-large wp-image-36518\\"" src=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2015\\/03\\/mlb-baltimore-orioles-workout-590x900.jpg\\"" alt=\\""\\"" width=\\""590\\"" height=\\""331\\"" srcset=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2015\\/03\\/mlb-baltimore-orioles-workout-590x900.jpg 590w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2015\\/03\\/mlb-baltimore-orioles-workout-300x600.jpg 300w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2015\\/03\\/mlb-baltimore-orioles-workout-268x150.jpg 268w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2015\\/03\\/mlb-baltimore-orioles-workout.jpg 850w\\"" sizes=\\""(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\\"" \\/><\\/a>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\""fs-center-img\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\""wp-caption-text\\"" style=\\""width:590px;\\"">Feb 25, 2015; Sarasota, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles stretch during spring training workouts at <strong><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/www.baseball-reference.com\\/player_search.cgi?results=smithed03,smithed05&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-thebaltimorewire.com\\"" target=\\""_blank\\"" rel=\\""nofollow\\"">Ed Smith<\\/a><\\/strong> Stadium.

This is depressing. Sorry. Know that I want to be terrible wrong.<\\/p>\\n<p>In 2014, Ubaldo Jimenez was 1-1 in spring training, with a 5.28 ERA in 15.1 innings. He walked six batters. He never really got off on a good foot.<\\/p>\\n<p>The truth is that he is always going to walk batters. Even when he pitched at his best, he walked too many hitters. Running deep counts, Ubaldo was never an innings-eater pitcher, and from the beginning I could not understand why the O\\u2019s thought he would be that for them.<\\/p>\\n<p>I will never again in my life hear the two words \\u201cmoving parts\\u201d without thinking of Ubaldo Jimenez. Indeed, they move. At the end of last year, the parts were tightened up and re-packaged into a more \\u201ccompact delivery.\\u201d There were improvements. But he still drops his arm straight down behind him (see picture), and that will not lead to consistent release points and pitch placement.<\\/p>\\n<p>I expect a better season from Jimenez in 2015, but not a great season, nor even a good one \\u2013 spring, summer, or fall. Look for the ERA to drop from 4.81 to a 4.20 to 4.30 or something of that sort. I then look for some discouragement to set in on him \\u2013 a fellow who seems to me from a distance to be a bit fragile through a good-hearted desire to achieve.<\\/p>\\n<p>And taking all the moving parts away may not bring about all the desired results. It could be a little bit like in Winnie-the-Pooh when they took away Tigger\\u2019s bounces \\u2013 the result was not something that anyone liked.<\\/p>\\n<p>So what are the Orioles going to do with him?\\u00a0 I don\\u2019t know; it\\u2019s a problem. Use him here and there where he can cause the least damage and get some return on the investment.

The power will be there, as it always will be \\u2013 when contact is made with the ball, which last year did not happen 30% of the time.<\\/p>\\n<p>I love the guy, but I\\u2019m pessimistic about what he is to do in order to get back to something remotely approaching 2013. I am afraid he has been \\u201cfigured out\\u201d and is a victim of sabermetrically-constructed defensive alignments and pitching strategies.<\\/p>\\n<p>Davis bunted in his first at-bat in the intra-squad game. He has talked about incorporating some more of that into his approach. But it is not an answer by itself. In a really<a href=\\""http:\\/\\/camdendepot.blogspot.com\\/2015\\/03\\/should-chris-davis-bunt-more-to-beat.html\\""> excellent article on Camden Depot<\\/a>, the writer lists the 8-9 guys who had more shifts thrown against them than Davis, and writes about how many had successful bunts. The number is incredibly small.<\\/p>\\n<p>It is easy to say that Davis needs to hit to the opposite field and spray the ball around rather than drive it to right all the time, often into the teeth of the defense. But teams are pitching him to hit into the defense deployed, of course.<\\/p>\\n<p>So Davis is going to get home runs when pitchers miss their spots. He is also going to hit hard balls right at perfectly-positioned defenders, balls that would be a hit for anyone else. I believe he will have an improved season over 2014, hitting perhaps in the .220s or .230s with 30-35 home runs. He will be a \\u201crich man\\u2019s <strong><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/www.baseball-reference.com\\/players\\/r\\/reynoma01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-thebaltimorewire.com\\"" target=\\""_blank\\"" rel=\\""nofollow\\"">Mark Reynolds<\\/a><\\/strong>.\\u201d And after the season, it will be up to teams to determine how much that sort of player is worth.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\""next-post lg slider\\""><a class=\\""location\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""next-post-shortcode\\"" href=\\""#\\""><span class=\\""next\\"">Next: <\\/span><span>The two catchers who go north with the O\'s ...<\\/span><\\/a><\\/div><!\\u2014pageview_candidate\\u2014>""},{""title"":""Baltimore Orioles Spring Training: Six Bold Predictions - Page 7"",""permalink"":""http:\\/\\/thebaltimorewire.com\\/2015\\/03\\/03\\/baltimore-orioles-spring-training-six-bold-predictions\\/5\\/"",""shortCodeTitle"":null,""content"":""<div id=\\""attachment_36526\\""  class=\\""wp-caption aligncenter\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2015\\/03\\/steve-clevenger-mlb-cleveland-indians-baltimore-orioles.jpg\\""><img class=\\""size-large wp-image-36526\\"" src=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2015\\/03\\/steve-clevenger-mlb-cleveland-indians-baltimore-orioles-590x900.jpg\\"" alt=\\""\\"" width=\\""590\\"" height=\\""421\\"" srcset=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2015\\/03\\/steve-clevenger-mlb-cleveland-indians-baltimore-orioles-590x900.jpg 590w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2015\\/03\\/steve-clevenger-mlb-cleveland-indians-baltimore-orioles-300x600.jpg 300w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/297\\/files\\/2015\\/03\\/steve-clevenger-mlb-cleveland-indians-baltimore-orioles.jpg 850w\\"" sizes=\\""(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\\"" \\/><\\/a>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\""fs-center-img\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\""wp-caption-text\\"" style=\\""width:590px;\\"">May 22, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles catcher <strong><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/www.baseball-reference.com\\/players\\/c\\/clevest01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-thebaltimorewire.com\\"" target=\\""_blank\\"" rel=\\""nofollow\\"">Steve Clevenger<\\/a><\\/strong> (45) prepares to throw down to first base in the eighth inning against the Cleveland Indians at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

There is little reading between the lines that in 2014 he was not in the sort of condition they desired, especially defensively.

03/04/2015,"[('Orioles spring training game 2 thread: vs. Tigers at home ...', "" The Orioles are back in action against the Tigers on Wednesday afternoon. This time, they'll be at their home digs for spring in Sarasota, and accordingly a more A-list bunch of O's will be in the lineup and on the mound as well. Whether the result will be any different, well... we'll just have to wait and see, won't we? Here's hoping yesterday's four HBPs will not come back around to bite the Orioles today.    Unlike yesterday, this game will be on the radio in Baltimore, on the new flagship station 105.7 FM. Don't go to WBAL out of old habit or you will not find baseball. You will probably find obnoxious talk radio instead. Ain't nobody got time for that. We'll all still have to wait until tomorrow night for a game on television, but there is one piece of good news about that: Gary Thorne and Jim Palmer were sighted in Sarasota today. Following Kevin Gausman on the mound in today's contest will be T.J. McFarland and Dylan Bundy. If all of these three guys can get through two innings, that'll be progress over yesterday. Others listed on the lineup card as available pitchers include Wesley Wright, Ryan Webb, and Tim Berry.    We could see this exact lineup in the regular season some time. It's not perfect by any means, with J.J. Hardy as a #2 batter standing out as going against the current best understanding of lineup construction, but these are definitely the guys who will be winning or losing this season.

He is the $85 million man signed through 2018 and he is now the longest-tenured Oriole. He has made his home here. His wife is from here. His son was born in Baltimore. The Orioles\' ascension from the depths of the American League East with Jones taking his game to another level. As the team has rattled off three straight good years, Jones has been the best player in that time.    All of which made it surprising and just a little bit worrying when Jones fired off\xc2\xa0a frustrated-sounding tweet into the Twittersphere in February: ""Im just going to start going to Peter. Screw the middle men"" It didn\'t take much of a leap for that to be concerning, a fairly obvious reference to Orioles owner Peter Angelos and Jones being unhappy about something. But what? Who are the middle men who had him so displeased? That is what we did not know and, not knowing, it was better to pretend that nothing had happened at all. The Baltimore Sun\'s Peter Schmuck got to the bottom of the mystery in an article posted to\xc2\xa0the Sun\'s website on Tuesday evening. The Orioles, as you know, didn\'t do a whole heck of a lot in the offseason and, in the process, they let the previous longest-tenured Oriole, Nick Markakis, head elsewhere in free agency. The two played together for seven seasons. No surprise that might have contributed to some frustration on the part of Jones.        ""I just want some communication.""-Adam Jones   ""If you say I\'m the face of the franchise, I think I would like a little bit of information about what\'s going on instead of being surprised by every move made,"" Jones said, according to Schmuck. He wanted ""to be able to talk,"" and it seems like he made an effort to engage Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations Dan Duquette that was not returned.    On the face of it, it\'s hard to come up with a good reason for why Duquette wouldn\'t have returned Jones\' phone calls, although at the same time, there\'s no telling whether star players in other cities have tried to do the same thing. If David Ortiz could find a phone near his person that he hasn\'t destroyed, would he use it to call Ben Cherington up and ask why the Red Sox didn\'t re-sign Jon Lester? If he did, would Cherington call back? Are we really talking about this? This whole thing is stupid. Without ever specifically addressing why he didn\'t get around to returning Jones\' attempts to reach him, Duquette said he\'d ""be happy to discuss things with Jones."" Though it seems he had a different philosophy back in November or December or whenever it was. Schmuck offers the dot that Duquette keeping a low profile as the Blue Jays situation played out could have been ""misconstrued"" by Jones, although that dot doesn\'t connect to anything said in a direct quote.    One thing the team has lacked in this run of success is stupid tabloid drama. We can only hope that won\'t change as a result of all of this. The last thing Orioles fans need is a slow start for the team that launches a thousand columns about whether Jones is disgruntled, or whether the clubhouse is missing the leadership of Markakis, with Derek from Dundalk, Earl from Essex, Frank from Federal Hill, and all of their friends jamming up the phone circuits of Baltimore sports talk radio with calls about how Duquette still has his eyes on the Blue Jays job and so he isn\'t doing everything he could to help the Orioles win.       For their part, both Jones and Duquette downplayed the notion that there was any kind of lingering discontent between the two men. Asked directly about whether there was a rift between them, Jones replied that there was not. ""I love the work our GM does,"" Jones said, according to Schmuck. ""He has done a damn good job of getting players over here that have something to work for, have a hunger in them."" We know how Jones loves those who stay hungry. ""I just want some communication,"" he concluded.    In typical Duquettian fashion, the O\'s GM remarked of Jones, ""I appreciate his passion and I also appreciate his opinions."" There are probably more diplomatic ways he might have expressed the thought, but there are less diplomatic ways too. That\'s Duquette for you. Have they really both buried the hatchet? At this point, there\'s no way to know for sure. They sound like they have. That counts for something. If the Orioles do well as the season goes along, we\'ll forget all about this, especially if some combination of Travis Snider and Alejandro De Aza or whoever else the O\'s stick in right field are outperforming what Markakis is doing in Atlanta. Nothing said in the offseason or spring training will matter, just like spring training games don\'t matter. Outside of this little kerfuffle, Jones sounds plenty confident in the strength of this team, at least if what he said to\xc2\xa0ESPN\'s Jayson Stark in a recent visit to O\'s camp is any indication, rejecting the validity of predictions that don\'t consider the Orioles a quality team. This whole thing has not hung like a cloud over the Orioles training camp. It hasn\'t been a daily topic of discussion even though spring training has been underway for over a week. Let\'s hope it stays that way.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Cespedes Off To Slammin\\u2019 Start, Tigers Rout Orioles \\xab CBS ...', ' LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Yoenis Cespedes hit a grand slam in his first game for Detroit, Ian Kinsler added a three-run homer and the Tigers routed the Baltimore Orioles 15-2 Tuesday in a spring training opener. Cespedes connected in the fourth inning for an 11-0 lead. The Tigers got the slugger from Boston in an offseason trade. Coming off a disappointing year, Baltimore starter Ubaldo Jimenez allowed six runs in 1 1-3 innings. He walked two, hit two batters and made a throwing error. Jimenez said he was working on pitches and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t concerned about his performance. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I can say is I did what I wanted to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Jimenez said. \xe2\x80\x9cI like my fastball and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to change anything. I expect more out of my control, but the error is the main thing that bothered me.\xe2\x80\x9d Four Detroit batters were hit by pitches. Third baseman Nick Castellanos was hit in the left hand and exited soon after that, but manager Brad Ausmus said he might play Wednesday. Kyle Lobstein, vying for the final spot in the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 rotation, allowed two hits in two shutout innings. He began last year at Triple-A before going 1-2 with a 4.35 ERA in six starts for Detroit at the end of the season. \xe2\x80\x9cI am kind of the sixth starter right now,\xe2\x80\x9d Lobstein said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s kind of the same situation as last year, but this year I feel more prepared.\xe2\x80\x9d Lobstein went 1-2 with a 4.35 earned run average in six starts for the Tigers last season. STARTING TIME Orioles: Showalter said it is far too early in the spring to be worried about Jimenez. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just has to throw strikes,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. Tigers: Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said he liked what he saw from Lobstein but it was too early to concede a spot in the rotation. The Tigers have David Price, Justin Verlander, Anibal Sanchez and Alfredo Simon already in place, leaving one opening. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  TRAINER\xe2\x80\x99S ROOM Orioles: Showalter said there were no injuries to report. Tigers: SS Jose Iglesias skipped this game but plans to start on Wednesday in Sarasota.

I just started hitting for the first time. We keep moving forward. Ausmus said that Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s return was a \xe2\x80\x9cgrey area.\xe2\x80\x9d UP NEXT Orioles: Kevin Gausman will make the start Wednesday in Sarasota against the Tigers.

03/05/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Rough Start in Spring Games', 'Mar 4, 2015; Sarasota, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles infielder Manny Machado (13) warms up before the second inning of a spring training game against the Detroit Tigers at Ed Smith Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY SportsThings are not going as planned for the Baltimore Orioles after the first two games of the spring training season. Losses of 15-2 and 5-4 to the Detroit Tigers are of course irrelevant in fact, yet the on-field performances so far of many players \xe2\x80\x93 particularly the projected 25-man roster personnel \xe2\x80\x93 are not what would be hoped for.But again, it is early; it is just a couple of games. It will likely soon be forgotten, maybe even after a pair of split-squad games on Thursday. And remember this, a bad day of Orioles baseball in Florida beats a good day of late-winter snow and ice in Maryland!However, consider some early numbers after these two games. The Orioles at the plate are 16-for-67 (.239).\xc2\xa0 The presumed 25-man roster players are just 5-for-31, while those others attempting to make the team or who will be slotted for the minors are a much better 11-for-36 combined.None of the six runs batted in have come off the stick of one of the presumed big league roster members. Nolan Reimold has two, whereas there is one each from Jolio Borbon, Henry Urrutia, Dariel Alvarez, and Jayson Nix \xe2\x80\x93 on a solo home run.The pitching has a couple of more bright spots, but still with more bad outings than good ones.There are efforts by both Buck Showalter and Ubaldo Jimenez to couch the righty\xe2\x80\x99s very nasty start in a better light than I believe can be supported by any reality. Jimenez himself said he did not need to change anything \xe2\x80\x93 that after giving up six runs in 1.1 innings, with two hit batters, two walks, a wild pitch and a throwing error \xe2\x80\xa6 yes, by Ubaldo. Throwing the ball is hard to do. Jimenez claimed to be just missing, getting the zone pinched. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I was not there to see it; but even so, that does not explain the batters hit or the wild pitch, etc., etc.Showalter said he liked Ubaldo\xe2\x80\x99s stuff, even to say that it is ahead of where he was a year ago. Actually, Jimenez made his first spring start on March 7th of 2014 against the Phillies and shut them down for two innings. Yes, it was the Phillies \xe2\x80\x93 I get that. Then in his second start he became the guy we all now know, giving up four runs on four hits and three walks in two innings to the \xe2\x80\xa6 wait for it, wait for it \xe2\x80\xa6 the Phillies!\xc2\xa0 So there goes that theory.As I wrote in my spring training bold predictions piece two days ago, I do seriously fear that Jimenez is not going to figure it out, other than for brief windows of time over the next three years.

Here is a fellow with a new knuckleball that is supposed to be terribly effective. Apparently it can be very good. He is going to throw it in a mix with other pitches \xe2\x80\x93 those other pitches being, pound for pound, sub-par compared to other pitchers at this level. So, wanting to make the team and make an impression, he does not throw many knuckleballs but rather gives up four runs in an inning on fastballs \xe2\x80\x93 including a three-run homer by Aaron Westlake who is a career minor leaguer with a .255 average. This is not putting one\xe2\x80\x99s best foot forward. Forgive me for being logical, and know that I wish for them all to succeed.At least we can write today that Kevin Gausman, T.J. McFarland, Dylan Bundy and Wesley Wright all looked reasonably good in their outings. On Wednesday it was Chaz Roe who go lit up for four of the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 five runs, all in one inning. We can bear that news. Ryan Webb allowed the fifth run.It is early, and please do forgive any snarky tone in anything said today; it is simply expressive writing coming out rather than criticism or discouragement about results.Bigger than anything is the fact that baseball is happening!

On the road in Port Charlotte for the afternoon half of a split squad day, the O\'s road warriors scored three runs in the last two innings against the Rays and held on for a 3-2 victory to win their first game of spring training. There\'s another game still to come on Thursday night, which will be televised on MASN at the standard civilized starting time for baseball, 7:05pm Eastern time.    There aren\'t many days where you have to shovel snow and can still watch live Orioles baseball that night, but we\'re getting one of them today. Spring training is strange. Through their three spring training games, the O\'s have done most of their scoring late in games. This was not an exception on Thursday afternoon. The game was scoreless on both sides until the Rays got on the board in the seventh inning against Mark Hendrickson. Starting Orioles position players only recorded a total of three hits before they were lifted later on in the game. This has been a theme through three games. It\'s far too early to make anything of it, especially since a starting lineup that has #3 hitter Steve Clevenger is not going to be something we see so often in the regular season.    When the Orioles did get on base, there were TOOTBLANs. Oh, God, the TOOTBLANs. If you didn\'t know, TOOTBLAN stands for Thrown Out On The Basepaths Like A Nincompoop and was first coined in response to Ryan Theriot\'s time with the Cubs.    It is used to refer to boneheaded baserunning, which encompasses nearly all baserunning that results in an unecessary out on the basepaths, and it was in full display on Thursday afternoon. One Oriole even committed the rare Double TOOTBLAN within a single game: This was the former Padres All-Star shortstop, who was playing second base today. He managed to get himself doubled off of first after a first inning walk. Those listening to Rays announcers on the radio thought this sounded like a lack of hustle or perhaps awareness when Clevenger popped up into the infield.       Later, after another walk, Clevenger followed with a single and today\'s TOOTBLAN artist ended up getting thrown out at second base after he took too wide of a turn around the base. Jimmy Paredes, today\'s starting third baseman, added a TOOTBLAN of his own when he got thrown out stealing at second base after a one-out single. About the baserunning miscues, O\'s manager Buck Showalter said, ""I\'d like for them to happen now so we can use them as a teaching tool."" It\'s good to have a positive outlook. O\'s pitching did well for much of the game. The trio of Wei-Yin Chen, Tyler Wilson, and Jason Garcia each pitched two innings and combined for only four hits and one walk allowed in that time. They also struck out a combined five batters, with two apiece for Garcia and Wlison and one for Chen. Of course, it\'s only March 5, so that\'s not worth a whole lot, but you\'d rather see these kinds of outings than the one that Ubaldo Jimenez had in the Grapefruit League opener.    The Rays scored first when Mark Hendrickson allowed a leadoff triple to Corey Brown (no relation) immediately followed by a double from Joey Butler. Hendrickson held them to only the one run. In the top of the eighth, the Orioles evened up the score. David Lough got to first with one out thanks to a throwing error by Rays shortstop Hak-Ju Lee. He advanced to second when Matt Tuiasosopo walked, leaving him in scoring position for a Rey Navarro single that snuck into right field. A scoreless bottom of the eighth from Zach Davies set up the O\'s to take the lead in the ninth. Michael Almanzar led off the inning with a home run out into left field to give the O\'s a 2-1 lead. A pair of infield singles by reserves Brian Ward and Garabez Rosa gave the O\'s another good scoring chance. Christian Walker lived up to his name and walked to load the bases. They grabbed their third run on a sacrifice fly from minor league outfielder Mike Yastrzemski. The third run proved important. Non-roster invitee Daniel Rodriguez surrendered a home run to Butler with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. That narrowed the score to 3-2, but he held on and the O\'s got their first win of the spring.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAfter suffering through a day stuck at home with 10 inches of snow to deal with in my 800\xe2\x80\x99 country driveway, I was ready to sit down as the seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock hour struck. Knowing the Baltimore Orioles were going to be televised on MASN at that time, I innocently changed the channel from the network news to MASN-HD. I looked into the kitchen as the theme song came on, up popped my wife\xe2\x80\x99s head, and all she said was, \xe2\x80\x9cOh no, is that starting already?\xe2\x80\x9dShe\xe2\x80\x99s not a big fan; she\xe2\x80\x99s not even a reader of this blog, so I can talk about her.But what\xe2\x80\x99s this \xe2\x80\x9cstarting already\xe2\x80\x9d about? Hey, it is more like, \xe2\x80\x9cFinally, it is starting!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You know what I mean!And I am struck anew about how much easier it is to write about the Orioles when one is able to SEE them, rather than simply read and react to what others have said, or to be digging through endless statistics.Looking at the Baltimore Orioles saw them defeat an admittedly less than stellar Toronto Blue Jays squad 5-0. But any day where an O\xe2\x80\x99s team beats a Jays team \xe2\x80\xa6 well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good day. Added to this is an earlier 3-2 win of another flock of the Birds over the Rays in Port Charlotte.The televised game brought not only the renewal of familiar faces, but also a reminder of the way Baltimore wins game. There was solid starting pitching from the consistent deliveries of Miguel Gonzalez, great relief pitching, and runs scored by the long ball \xe2\x80\x93 a three-run shot by Chris Davis and a two-run blast from Jonathan Schoop.Of particular interest to O\xe2\x80\x99s fans would be to see the three returning players who were out at the end of last year, as these three are considered so critical to the return of the Orioles to the top of the division. Of course we are talking about Davis, and even more about Manny Machado and Matt Wieters.Davis hit a no-doubter dinger, dropping the head of the bat hard on a low breaking pitch and lifting it deep into the Sarasota night. If he does this once a game, we\xe2\x80\x99d all forgive his strikeouts in every other at-bat. Crush looked very good in the field as well. Time will tell.The one of these three that looked the best to me was Machado. He was making all of the plays in the field and showing no ill effects whatsoever. But what was especially encouraging were the beautiful swings he put on balls when at the plate. Machado drilled hard singles in the first two at-bats; he was right on the pitch.As good as Manny looked, I thought that Wieters appeared the opposite. He seemed to be behind on every swing. He had the appearance of a player struggling to catch up to the speed of the game. I guess that is not surprising, but as I wrote recently, I am not encouraged that he is going to be ready for the beginning of the season.Ryan Lavarnway had a pretty good game. He made a perfect throw to second on a strike-out / throw-out double play with runners at the corners and one out. He looked decent at the plate, and all of that put together is what he is going to need to make the team.

He is the last guy on the planet you\xe2\x80\x99d want to be standing next to in a lightning storm. Reimold just missed a diving catch in foul territory after entering the game as a late-innings replacement in right field. It looked like he could well have injured his left shoulder, though he appeared to shake it off. In his one at-bat, Reimold hit a high chopper to short, and displaying his incredible speed to first, he almost beat it out \xe2\x80\xa6 and maybe he did. But, he\xe2\x80\x99d never have good enough luck to get the call to go his way.All of the Orioles pitchers looked very good. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just single out Zach Britton whose stuff was as nasty as ever. Again, it is the pitching that will most likely take the Orioles to the top of the division \xe2\x80\xa6 more than what is or is not going to replace the losses of Nelson Cruz and Nick Markakis.Oh, speaking of Cruz, one quick little sad moment was to see Schoop return to the dugout after his homer, but Cruz was not the first person there with the slaps, jump and bump routine \xe2\x80\x93 gonna miss that.But hey, can you believe it?

(AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Chris Davis hit a long three-run homer and the Baltimore Orioles beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-0 to win the second half of their split-squad doubleheader Thursday night. Earlier in the day, the Orioles beat Tampa Bay 3-2 at Port Charlotte. Davis, who will have to sit out the season opener as he serves the final game of his 25-game suspension for amphetamine use, homered to right-center field off Chad Jenkins in the third inning. \xe2\x80\x9cI liked it because it put the Orioles ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounded good. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather him do that than not.\xe2\x80\x9d Davis has been working with new Baltimore hitting coach Scott Coolbaugh this spring. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been working real hard,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cGet a little return on it. Nothing wind-aided tonight, thick air. He had to square it up.\xe2\x80\x9d Jonathan Schoop added a two-run homer in the seventh for Baltimore. Dayan Viciedo was 0 for 3 in his first game for the Blue Jays. He was signed to a minor league contract Sunday after the Chicago White Sox released him. In 2014, Viciedo hit .231 for Chicago with 21 home runs and 58 RBIs. He struck out 122 times and walked just 32. In the sixth inning, Viciedo sent a ball to deep center for a long out. \xe2\x80\x9cHe takes his rips,\xe2\x80\x9d Toronto manager John Gibbons said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hit that one ball to center field. He\xe2\x80\x99s a strong guy. He has a power game. He\xe2\x80\x99s versatile enough that he can play some left field, third base, first base if he had to. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what he does with his bat.\xe2\x80\x9d STARTING TIME: Blue Jays: Rookie Daniel Norris gave up a hit in a scoreless 1 2/3 innings. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a measuring (stick), just kind of seeing where I am feeling and if my pitches are doing what they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to,\xe2\x80\x9d Norris said. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember years back in spring training, it was like, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel anything, you\xe2\x80\x99re not throwing, stuff\xe2\x80\x99s not doing what it does mid-season \xe2\x80\x94 not that it was tonight, but it was a better building block, a good start to my progression.\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles: Miguel Gonzalez pitched two scoreless innings allowing one hit and struck out two. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to show every pitch to guys you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be facing a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d Gonzalez said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo especially early in camp, just go out there and work on your fastball command and, you know, it really worked out tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d Baltimore allowed just two runs in 18 innings. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought everybody threw the ball well,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a good day for pitching.\xe2\x80\x9d YOON RELEASED: The Orioles released South Korean right-hander Suk-min Yoon.

However the main event in a sense was last night at Ed Smith Stadium in Sarasota, when the O\xe2\x80\x99s took on Toronto. The 5-0 victory was a microcosm in a sense \xe2\x80\x93 of 2014, that is. The Orioles used power (from Chris Davis) and great pitching to defeat Toronto.Miguel Gonzalez inked his first start of the spring, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint during the short time he was in the game. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 2 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 2 K. Gonzalez told MASN after the game that he was spending the spring working on his fastball command. If those two innings were any indication, he\xe2\x80\x99s done a decent job thus far.Brian Matusz and Tommy Hunter were strong out of the \xe2\x80\x98pen as well, however the guys who really struck me were Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Zach Britton. O\xe2\x80\x99Day struck out the side in the fourth inning, and while Britton fell behind early in the count to his first hitter he retired the side 1-2-3. One thing I noticed about Gonzalez and all of the regulars in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen was that there seemed to be a huge focus on recording strike one. Pitching from a position of power in the count can make a world of difference, and we saw it in action last night.Manny Machado had a good night as well, going 2-for-3 on the night, with two strong line drive hits to left field. The second of those was in the fifth, and it was later followed up by an opposite field single by Adam Jones (who incidentally drew a walk in his first at-bat). That brought Chris Davis to the plate, and DavisCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsdelivered his first homer of the spring to put the O\xe2\x80\x99s up 3-0. Jonathan Schoop would add his first homer of the spring in the last of the seventh to run the score to 5-0 which of course was the final.Offensively while this was only one game, we saw the bats break out just a bit \xe2\x80\x93 or as much as they can this early in the spring. However the positive sign to me was that not only did a couple of guys have incredibly positive at-bats, but the heart of the order functioned as it was supposed to. One of the big questions coming into camp this year was how would the O\xe2\x80\x99s replace the power they lost when Nelson Cruz went to Seattle. The hope of course has been that Jones hitting third followed by Davis would help to ease the burden of not having Cruz. To say the least, it worked last night.All Grapefruit League games need to come with the following disclaimer: results (good or bad) should be taken with a grain of salt. And when I say\xc2\xa0results, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean wins and losses; those are truly irrelevant. But I\xe2\x80\x99m talking more about within the ebb and flow of games. Yes Jones and Davis looked good back-to-back in the lineup last night. However that was also against Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s travel roster. And the same should be said about Oriole pitching looking strong against Toronto hitters.But needless to say you\xe2\x80\x99d rather take\xc2\xa0looking good\xc2\xa0with a grain of salt as opposed to\xc2\xa0looking bad. One thing that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be taken with a grain of salt per se is Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 first at-bat in which he drew a rare walk. If Jones can improve his OBP by drawing walks and by using Davis as his protection in the lineup, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will be in good shape this year.The Orioles face Toronto again this afternoon, as they travel to Dunedin, FL and send rule 5 draft pick Mike Wright to the mound. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s R.A. Dickey. We obviously won\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure until the travel roster is released, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect too many Oriole regulars to see action against the knuckleballer Dickey today.

Most of the team is looking pretty good.In fact, 17 of the 25 earned runs that Baltimore has yielded in these first five games have been given up by just four pitchers: Ubaldo Jimenez, Eddie Gamboa, Chaz Roe, and Oliver Drake.It is early.What about Ubaldo Jimenez and his initial performance?There was nothing encouraging about it, and trying to put a pretty face on it recalls an old illustration of putting lipstick on a pig \xe2\x80\xa6 or something like that.I have written several times recently that I believe there is legitimate concern that Jimenez is not going to truly ever put it all together again for any sustained period of time. A few more outings like this one and I fear the frustration and disappointment will take over and give it a quantum boost in the wrong direction.Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope it is early.Things don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be going well for Steve JohnsonYes, Johnson is looking a bit like the pitching version of Nolan Reimold.

The O\xe2\x80\x99s brought very few regularsto Dunedin for the game yesterday, although Alejandro De Aza (one regular that did make the trip) did smack a two-run homer. Jimmy Paredes was inserted into the lineup later in the game, and went 1-for-1 at the plate.Paredes of course was a guy for whom the Orioles traded last year, and he proved valuable to the franchise in the absence of Manny Machado late in the season. The question is whether or not the Birds can find a spot for him on their roster in 2015. And quite frankly, that\xe2\x80\x99s a big question.Courtersy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAnd my personal opinion is that they might not be able to do so. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 infield is pretty well set with the exception of perhaps second base. So that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave very many options for Paredes, who I do think has a chance at being a player in the big leagues. In 18 games with the O\xe2\x80\x99s last year, Paredes hit .302 with two homers. That\xe2\x80\x99s a small sample size for sure, but he also showed a propensity for coming through in the clutch.The Orioles will probably need to figure out what to do with Paredes, lest they risk losing him on waivers. My recommendation would be to work out some sort of trade with someone who might be able to use a guy like him. Bear in mind, I do think that he could make a difference in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 system. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99d make it through waivers as an Oriole. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to him and his abilities.Some players are worth more to the organization on the field, and some are worth more on the trade market. Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about a blockbuster trade by any means, but someone like Paredes could certainly bring a low level prospect to the organization to help with depth. Furthermore, sending Paredes to a team where he could be on the roster and play more often than here and there would benefit him as he progresses through his career.The Orioles return to Sarasota this afternoon to take on Boston at 1 PM.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe culminating post of my position rankings will add all those rankings together, to give me a mathematical ranking for the AL East in 2015, but I will also add my own opinions as I make my predictions for one of the toughest divisions in baseball.Let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, it is going to be another dog fight in the AL East.The Red Sox are going to be able to hit, and it appears play some defense too.\xc2\xa0 The Yankees have pieces at pitching, if they can belie their age and also stay healthy.The Jays made a bunch more moves in the offseason, and the Rays are always a threat with their pitching.Meanwhile, the Orioles are defending champions.\xc2\xa0 So, what do I think will happen in 2015? Well, I added up the position rankings for: Catcher, First Base, Second Base, Third Base, Shortstop, Left Field, Center Field, Right Field, Designated Hitter, Starting Pitching, and Relief Pitching, injected my own thoughts, and came up with the following predictions.1. Baltimore Orioles (42 points, 93-69, 1st in AL East in 2015)Last year, the Orioles ended up with the most points, but I thought they would finish second and get a wild card berth. Well, I was wrong, and for this Orioles fan, I was more than okay with that.\xc2\xa0 And this year, they end up tied for first.\xc2\xa0 And I decide this year I am picking the Birds.This team has the stars to carry the team, both on the mound and at the plate.\xc2\xa0 They are a team that has proven its worth.\xc2\xa0 Sure, they play in a tough division, but the Orioles have feasted on their divisional competitors since Buck Showalter came to town.\xc2\xa0 They have an established rotation with no change, and even though they lost last year\xe2\x80\x99s HR leader in Nelson Cruz, the combined production of Matt Wieters, Manny Machado and a healthy Chris Davis could easily eclipse Cruz. And truly, replacing Nick Markakis is not that difficult (sorry O\xe2\x80\x99s fans who are still holding on.)The team has very few weaknesses.\xc2\xa0 Sure, there are questions about left field and right field.\xc2\xa0 But, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have a whole host of candidates to pick up the slack.\xc2\xa0 Second base with either Jonathan Schoop or Everth Cabrera will be solidified over last year.\xc2\xa0 If Ubaldo Jimenez continues to pitch like he did to start Spring Training, he won\xe2\x80\x99t be in the rotation.While some national pundits are forgetting one of the best teams in baseball over the last three years, I think they make it back-to-back in the AL East.2. Boston Red Sox (42 points, 89-73, 2nd in AL East, second wild card position)I have the Red Sox getting the same number of points as the Orioles, and where I think the difference lies is with starting pitching.\xc2\xa0 Both teams have a rotation of proven starters.\xc2\xa0 However, the Red Sox\xe2\x80\x99 current top pitcher is Clay Buchholz.\xc2\xa0 He was awful last year.\xc2\xa0 And although all the pitchers are veterans, none are a 1 or 2 pitcher.Their bullpen is good, their infield should be very good.\xc2\xa0 The Red Sox still are putting a lot of faith into two young players in Xander Bogaerts and Rusney Castillo, but I think both are now ready.\xc2\xa0 The Red Sox also have players like David Ortiz and Dustin Pedroia who do not have too many more years left.I know that this same Red Sox team finished last in 2014, but let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, these Red Sox are much different. All different pitchers, players healthy, etc. I expect a playoff-caliber year from the Red Sox in 2015.3. Toronto Blue Jays (31 points, 88-74, 3rd in AL East)I have the Jays just barely missing out on a playoff berth.\xc2\xa0 This team is on the cusp of being good.\xc2\xa0 They have pieces in place at so many positions.\xc2\xa0 But it never seems to come together.\xc2\xa0 Maybe it is a lack of leadership from the manager?The Jays\xe2\x80\x99 pitching is going to be very interesting moving forward.\xc2\xa0 As documented, they have two aging veterans and several young pitchers.\xc2\xa0 Can the veterans deliver what is expected of them, and the young guns live up to their reputations? Only time will tell.The team has obvious upgrades at 3B and C, but they also have concerns at relief pitcher. Their previous closer is gone, and not having a proven closer is always cause for concern, especially for a team that wants to take it to the next level.\xc2\xa0 I think the Jays are going to be a powerful team, a force to be reckoned with in the division, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they get the job done.4. New York Yankees (26 points, 77-85, 4th in AL East)Somehow the 2014 Yankees held it together until Baltimore ran away with the division.\xc2\xa0 They were right on the Orioles tail until the last two months.\xc2\xa0 And that was with all the injured players and a piece-meal rotation made up of acquisitions and other spare parts.I actually expect 2015 to be worse. The team is relying on an aging core of players at 1B, 2B, RF, DH. Their pitching staff features three guys coming off major injuries in Masahiro Tanaka, C.C. Sabathia, and Ivan Nova.\xc2\xa0 Sabathia is aging quickly. Their bullpen, other than the lights-out back end, has more questions than answers.All of this adds up to a lot of concerns on how good the Yankees will be in 2015.\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of changes may be made in-season to try to right the ship heading toward 2016, and they may be some tough decisions.5. Tampa Bay Rays (24 points, 71-91, 5th in AL East)I think the Rays are in for a long season.\xc2\xa0 Last year, they were six games better than this projection.\xc2\xa0 That was with David Price for part of the season. Matt Moore is still out until the All-Star Break.The pitching will keep them in almost every game.\xc2\xa0 And some players, namely Evan Longoria, are due to bounce back.\xc2\xa0 But, their defense includes underwhelming players in Desmond Jennings and David DeJesus, and Kevin Kiermaier. Their infield will be good defensively, but lacking a lot of power.And the bullpen is going to continue to be a question, as Grant Balfour is another year older.\xc2\xa0 With Joe Maddon, one of the smartest minds in the game gone, and Andrew Friedman as well, it will be interesting to see what happens in Tampa this year.There you have it, all the predictions.\xc2\xa0 Who agrees?

Mandatory Credit: Denny Medley-USA TODAY SportsOne of the inscrutable questions of the offseason has been the speculation surrounding the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starting rotation. What is to become of six players vying for five positions? And it will be five positions. There is no possibility of a six-man rotation, not even in some modified format. To do so would seem to work on paper, but it in fact it throws routines out of whack to the extent of being a net negative.Even today on MASN\xe2\x80\x99s Wall to Wall Baseball broadcast, former O\xe2\x80\x99s pitcher and current analyst Dave Johnson gave the most common answer that has been heard as to what might eventuate. It is some version of \xe2\x80\x9cthe situation will solve itself,\xe2\x80\x9d most likely in the form of an injury to one of the contestants.There is reasonable thought and logic behind that sentiment. That the Orioles only used seven starters in 2014, and that one of them \xe2\x80\x93 T.J. McFarland \xe2\x80\x93 was only used once is a statistic almost unheard of in the modern game of baseball.But what if all of the six contenders are playing and pitching at the same high level, or at least within a relative range of similar execution? How will it get sorted out? It is difficult to imagine that any of them should have to step back or play a bullpen role.The starter most likely to struggle is, at the same time, the least likely candidate to have success out of the bullpen. And the two pitchers best suited to handle bullpen roles really should not have to be \xe2\x80\x9cpunished\xe2\x80\x9d in this way, as they still have multiple years of service ahead with the Orioles.The first time out in spring training for each of the six starters probably does not indicate much, as each is working on pitching elements without primary concern for results, along with little regard for scouting reports on minor leaguers, etc.\xc2\xa0 Their early results have been a mixed bag.So much could happen; so much could change, but here are my anticipations as to what might be expected for this season \xe2\x80\xa6 stated in general terms \xe2\x80\xa6Chris Tillman \xe2\x80\x93 He is the ace of the staff, whether one likes to use that term or not. Take out his couple of bad performances, and his numbers are among the best in the league.

He worked out significantly over the offseason with Brady Anderson \xe2\x80\x93 probably the single best thing any player could do for enhanced performance.

Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s contributions could be critical to team success, particularly late in the year.Bud Norris \xe2\x80\x93 It will be difficult to repeat the 2014 season.

Yes, it is a final season before free agency, but still \xe2\x80\xa6 just don\xe2\x80\x99t expect awesome. But whatever he has to give will be given.

Ultimately for Jimenez, this start is a net improvement over his last outing. While he still struggled at times, there weren\xe2\x80\x99t the glaring holes in the stat line that we saw earlier last week against Detroit.Minnesota did play the opportunist while Jimenez wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pitching well in the first.

Four were non-roster invitees being reassigned to minor league camp: Infielder Michael Almanzar, catcher Brian Ward, and pitchers Dane De La Rosa and Chris Jones. Also, the team optioned pitcher Oliver Drake to Triple-A Norfolk.    None of these were surprising moves. A lot of things would have had to go wrong for any of them to make the team coming out of spring training. Odds of seeing any at the big league level with the O's this year are small. But there's little risk in taking a look at a bunch of people over the first couple of weeks of workouts and games, not to mention that a team needs some sacrificial players to toss out in the late innings of spring training games while they're trying to ease players into their workload. Four of the five had appeared in Grapefruit League games. Almanzar got five plate appearances over five games, with two hits including a home run. Ward batted four times over four games, recording two hits. Jones appeared in two games, allowing a run in 2.2 innings pitched. Drake also pitched in two games, giving up four runs in only 1.1 innings of work. It's spring training, a small sample size that generally doesn't matter. All of them would have soon been ticketed for minor league camp even if they'd all thrown perfect innings or hit home runs every time up. That's the way it is.    The O's started out with 57 players in camp and even with these five reassigned, they have 52, more than double what they can carry on the 25-man roster.

Understand, there is no complaint here that after a long, cold winter without baseball, finally games are being played again in Florida and Arizona. But the storylines regarding the roster are not nearly as compelling as previous years, nor what they will be at this time next year.There is not really a lot of intrigue about what is going to be the composition of the April roster for the Baltimore Orioles.

This leaves six additional bullpen positions. Zach Britton, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Tommy Hunter are three of them. The other three positions will likely include Brad Brach and T.J. McFarland, leaving only questions about what to do with Brian Matusz, Wesley Wright, or how to keep a Rule 5 player.Regarding Position Players: Again, apart from something unexpected happening, the outfield is set with Adam Jones, Alejandro De Aza, Travis Snider, Steve Pearce, Delmon Young and David Lough. The infield question comes down to which of three players cover second base and utility man: Jonathan Schoop, Ryan Flaherty and Everth Cabrera. The only catching question is if someone can pass Caleb Joseph for the backup role.The Baltimore Orioles 40-man roster and beyond is filled with quality players. A number of those who do not go north in April will contribute; this happens every year, even if it cannot be anticipated during spring training. So, for many of these players on the fringe, spring training is about positioning for the inevitable changes that will come \xe2\x80\x93 to be prepared to be called upon in need and take advantage of that opportunity.Beyond that, it is not too much of a stretch to say that the 2016 season is in view for many of these players.

Yes, there may still be 4 feet of snow on the lawn outside my apartment, but baseball is back...even if it is just fantasy baseball.    Although I won't be playing fantasy baseball this year, I can still remember the days where I would spend hours and hours researching players before the draft. Maybe I was just weird, but I wanted to know every piece of relevant information about a player before I drafted him, including his injury history. Generally it wasn't too hard to find out if a guy had an injury last year, but to have a detailed injury history I always had to have multiple websites open during the draft. Anyone who plays fantasy sports knows how hectic the draft is and having a cheat sheet is always helpful. So, consider this the official fantasy baseball injury cheat sheet for Orioles players.

While Machado may be a bit of risk due to his injury history, he also has tons of upside. Zach Britton Trips to the 60 day DL: 1 (Left shoulder impingement 2012)  Trips to the 15 day DL: 1 (Left shoulder strain 2011) Seasons with at least 60 relief appearances:\xc2\xa01 (2014)    Bottom line: Britton transitioned very nicely into the closer's role and hasn't spent a day on the DL since becoming a reliever.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsIt is exceedingly unusual for any less-than-pleasant rumblings to come out of the Baltimore Orioles clubhouse, a place that in the era of Buck Showalter has been the MLB exemplar of the happy baseball family. But a series of tremors have made the china rattle slightly in the dining room cabinet, temblors that would not even interrupt a sentence on the West Coast, but in the fault-free baseball geography of Baltimore merit articles in the press.That fact that former clubhouse leader Nick Markakis was annoyed his circumstances and offers did not eventuate in fulfilling a desire to stay in Baltimore is only surprising insofar as he generally does not say much about anything. The uncharacteristic edge in his remarks opened the door perhaps for other statements of friends and past teammates to follow.The first of these was Adam Jones, who had some pretty blunt things to say. He especially made some remarks about being the face of the franchise and desiring perhaps some more open communication with The Warehouse management. Certainly Jones wants to win; if anybody wants success more than Adam, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who it is with the Orioles. Jones is going to \xe2\x80\x9cgo off\xe2\x80\x9d once in a while, which is simply his personality. What I think we especially hear from him is the clubhouse sentiment of feeling the loss of Markakis, as the realization that Nick is gone is really now sinking in as the old gang gets back together again \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cHe was known in this clubhouse, he was known in the community, he was known as a guy who just showed up to work and did his job. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you want out of an individual and that\xe2\x80\x99s what you want out of a teammate and that\xe2\x80\x99s what you want out of a man. That was my definition of Markakis. He came to work every day.\xe2\x80\x9dNext came an interview of Chris Davis with Peter Schmuck of The Baltimore Sun, where Davis expressed a somewhat similar concern about ownership and management being fully committed to retaining a winning combination on the field for an extended time. Some negative reaction came from the fanbase on this, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Davis was being persnickety. What I heard was a hope and desire to be able to stay in Baltimore, though (having seen Markakis go) a concern expressed that it might not work out.\xe2\x80\x9cSome things are going to have to change as far as contracts are concerned, because we have a lot of young guys that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a chance to sign before free agency and, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you one thing, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to play for a team that has no shot at competing every year. The next contract I sign I would like it to be my last one, and I have no desire to play for a loser every year.\xe2\x80\x9dAgain, this surely looks worse on paper than it probably sounded coming from the likeable big guy. Whereas Jones has the equity to say what he says and the way he says it, honestly, after the 2014 season for Davis I feel these remarks \xe2\x80\x93 no matter how gently stated \xe2\x80\x93 are ill-advised. If he really wants to stay in Baltimore, two things he can do are: Have a great 2015 season and retain the services of a different agent.The next player up with remarks was J.J. Hardy. As is imaginable, he was more measured in what he said, aided by his own situation as having signed a three-year extension.

03/12/2015,"[('Orioles beaten up by former Orioles in 8-2 spring loss to ...', ' The Orioles played another spring training game on Thursday afternoon and they lost another spring training game on Thursday afternoon. Remember not to panic, because as my friend and Camden Chat predecessor Stacey points out,\xc2\xa0spring training stats don\'t matter. Still, it\'s hard to muster a heck of a lot of enthusiasm for a set of Orioles games that aren\'t on TV or radio in Baltimore and that the team isn\'t winning. They lost this particular game to the Cardinals by an 8-2 margin.    Is it much comfort that they lost even though they weren\'t trying all that hard to win? As is customary in spring training, the bulk of the team\'s veterans and regulars stayed behind while a B-squad was sent on a bus ride. It seems unlikely that many regular season games will hinge on the success or failure of players like Jayson Nix and Matt Tuiasosopo. Many regular season games will hinge on the success or failure of starting pitcher Bud Norris, though. He took the mound to get Thursday\'s game started. He was supposed to get through three innings of work and did not finish the third inning. In 2.2 innings of work, he walked three batters and hit another. Norris also gave up three hits, including a three-run home run off the bat of former Oriole Mark Reynolds. This was not the last bruising by former players from the Orioles organization in the game.    About the outcome of his start, Norris was not concerned. ""The key for me is getting out of there and staying healthy. It\'s good to have some ups and downs,"" Norris\xc2\xa0told O\'s reporters. He also said that he knows he needs to work on pitching from the windup for next time. That\'s spring training for you, and that\'s one reason why it doesn\'t matter.    The Reynolds home run squandered an early Orioles 1-0 lead that they picked up in the top of the first inning against Cardinals starter Jaime Garcia. Nix delivered a one out single and advanced to second when Nolan Reimold took a walk. A double by Jimmy Paredes drove home Nix. That also ended the inning, however, when Reimold was thrown out at the plate. Nincompoopery is afoot in any out on the basepaths, though who exactly to blame for this instance is up for some debate.    By the time Norris left the game, the O\'s trailed 3-1. Brad Brach relieved Norris. The first three batters he faced all reached: A double, a walk, and an RBI single that left the O\'s trailing 4-1. Brach also pitched the fourth, giving up another walk but no more hits and no more runs. He also got two strikeouts.    The fifth inning brought Dylan Bundy to the mound. With the exception perhaps of Ubaldo Jimenez, there\'s no other O\'s pitcher from whom you\'d like to see some good spring training results, even if those results don\'t matter. Those results were not there today. A couple of former O\'s farmhands touched him up in the fifth: Michael Ohlman drove a double to the opposite field and then scored on a single by Matt Shaffner\'s all-time favorite Orioles prospect, Ty Kelly. Wait, a catcher scored from second on a single? Is that allowed? MASN\'s Roch Kubatko described the Kelly single on Twitter as ""a soft liner that deflected off (Jonathan) Schoop\'s glove."" Perhaps a bad bit of BABIP luck there. Bundy added a 1-2-3 sixth before being relieved at the start of the seventh inning. A second Orioles run did not cross the plate until the seventh inning, and that only came after a leadoff double from Henry Urrutia turned into Urrutia advancing and then scoring on consecutive groundouts. Steve Clevenger got the RBI for his grounder to second base that scored Urrutia. You can certainly do worse with a man on third and less than two out, like strike out.    In the bottom of the seventh, Mark Hendrickson was on the mound for the O\'s. Things did not go so well. After an infield single and a walk, Hendrickson faced two men on with no one out. He got a grounder off the bat of Dean Anna to get one out, but that put both runners in scoring position. Next up was Ohlman once again. Ohlman ended up safely on first after a fielder\'s choice with no out recorded. Substitute second baseman Rey Navarro seems to have thrown home, but he could not get out the runner. Bad luck or Hendrickson suffering from a fielder making a poor decision? It doesn\'t matter. It\'s still unfortunate. Stephen Piscotty added a double to score another Cardinals run. That was all for Hendrickson, who left the game with only one out recorded. He was relieved by the elder Bundy, Bobby. Bundy allowed one of the inherited runners to score on a sacrifice fly, then struck out yet another former Oriole, Scott Moore, to end the seventh with the O\'s trailing 8-2. Moore was the only former Oriole in the game who didn\'t do any damage to them. Hunter Harvey pitched the bottom of the eighth for the O\'s. He hit the leadoff batter, Xavier Scruggs, before sending the next three Cardinals down in order. I hope he gets into one of the MASN games. A team is not going to win many games where they only get five hits and one walk. That was the Orioles today. Only three of the starting hitters safely reached base at any point.    Next up for the O\'s is another game on the road, this one in the Toronto camp. On the bright side, this one at least will be on TV, as long as you get the MLB Network. The game has a 1:07 scheduled start time.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""Baltimore Orioles: How important is Wieter's backup?"", 'Photo: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY SportsIt\xe2\x80\x99s hardly the most exciting roster spot, but the backup catcher position could be an important role for the Orioles in 2015, at least in the beginning of the season. It seems at this point All-Star Matt Wieters will be healthy enough to be in the lineup on opening day, and the Orioles couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happier about having him back. However, after recovering from Tommy John surgery and almost a full season away from the field it could be awhile before the Orioles see the Matt Wieters everybody remembers.It\xe2\x80\x99s still very early in the Spring, and hardly time for Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans to panic, but Matt Wieters has begun March 0-20 at the plate. This is probably to be expected after missing so much time. Wieters is a tall guy with a long swing. He\xe2\x80\x99ll need some time to regain timing.Also, there is no doubt he has done everything in his power to be ready for the season, but no time in the gym or on the practice field can get a player\xe2\x80\x99s endurance game ready like being on the field. For those reasons, the backup catcher could see significant time early in the season, and the decision behind who that will be becomes that much more important.The front-runner would have to be last season\xe2\x80\x99s starter Caleb Joseph. Joseph was impressive behind the plate for much of the season, and is probably the best defensively out of the options available. However, he struggled mightily with the bat late last season, including a .080 average in September. The dip in production could\xe2\x80\x99ve came from the fatigue of catching an entire major-league season, but if during the spring he shows that last September could be the norm, he could quickly lose his spot.Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s horrendous September could be the reason the Orioles brought in veteran J.P. Arenciba. Joseph would probably have the advantage defensively, but Arencibia has shown he can hit for power in the past, hitting 18 or more homers in three of his five Major-League seasons. Although he has struggled mightily to a sub-.200 batting average the past two seasons, his past power numbers will probably get him a long look during the spring.The two long shots to win the job are Steve Clevenger and Ryan Lavarnway. Clevenger won the job last season coming\xc2\xa0out of spring training, but Buck was never satisfied with his defense and he was quickly sent back to AAA. In the minors, hitting was never Clevenger\xe2\x80\x99s issue, as evidence by his .304 average last season. Although he has never be able to repeat that success at the major-league level, the issue may be his inability to adjust to inconsistent at-bats as a backup.Ryan Lavarnway gives the Orioles another Major-League level option in training camp, and options is something the Orioles value. Like Clevenger, he has produced solid numbers in the minors while finding it difficult to secure consistent ABs at the major-league level. However, also similar to Clevenger, his defense is probably not up to par with what Buck wants at the position.The Orioles may see more of the backup catcher than they would want early in the season as Matt Wieters returns to game speed. Given the offensive the Orioles lost this past offseason, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting whether Buck will choose to go with offense behind Wieters when the team goes north or whether if he\xe2\x80\x99ll stick with defense as has been his norm.

Yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s 8-2 loss to St. Louis is an example, as starter Bud Norris teetered a few times before finally buckling and giving up a three-run homer to former Oriole Mark Reynolds.

Third base coach Bobby Dickerson has always been a bit overly-aggressive, however in this scenario I feel it was warranted. Remember folks, this is spring training; seeing what kind of speed various players have up and down the roster is part of the deal. Which is just another reason why you can\xe2\x80\x99t put too much stock in game results.\xc2\xa0With one out in the third St. Louis used a single and a walk to get two aboard, and former Oriole Mark Reynolds haunted the Birds with a three-run homer. Pete Kozma and Ty Kelly would add RBI-singles later in the game, and St. Louis would add three more later in the game. Steve Clevenger would also add an RBI on a ground out, scoring the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 second run of the game.However Oriole pitching did struggle today a bit, and there have been struggles here and there throughout camp. To this point, the good news has been that the majority of the damage has been done to guys who primarily won\xe2\x80\x99t be on the big league roster. However Brad Brach did give up a run yesterday, as did Dylan Bundy. However as I said above, we can\xe2\x80\x99t put too much stock in the results in these games.Buck Showalter admitted that Norris wasn\xe2\x80\x99t where he needed to be, however he also seemed to indicate that he was confident that he (Norris) would get there:\xe2\x80\x9cNot where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be, he needs to be.

Nevertheless, I will say that it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for pitchers to hit rough patches in spring training. And furthermore as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said previously, that\xe2\x80\x99s why they play these games.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are not getting the team results desired thus far in spring training 2015, falling to a record of 3-8 overall after yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s 8-2 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. Nobody is panicking, even though one might expect that if the O\xe2\x80\x99s players are progressing in their skills on schedule, it might be expected that it would yield something closer to .500.And certainly the later games in the spring are worth multiple times more in value than the early games. The veterans are playing more, and teams are working more toward getting into a tighter mode of play and a winning disposition.So how do spring training records and regular season records compare over recent years? After a string of many losing seasons, the Baltimore Orioles have put together three consecutive winning years. Is there any correspondence to what happens in Florida?Well here is chart of the past 10 years before this season for the Birds, comparing records from the Grapefruit League with the regular season\xe2\x80\xa6YearGrapefruit RecordSeason Record201413-996-66201319-985-77201211-1393-69201115-1569-93201012-1766-96200913-2164-98200810-1768-93200716-1369-93200613-1770-92200515-1174-88\xc2\xa0A quick glance and overall summary at the chart above reveals that about half the time the spring season was somewhat predictive of the year to follow, and the other half of the time it had nothing to do with what eventuated.For example, just last year a record of 13-9 when projected over a 162-game season equates to a win total of 96 \xe2\x80\x93 exactly what happened!\xc2\xa0 However, in 2007 the Orioles were 16-13 in Florida but only won a total of 69 games that year. The numbers in 2005 are also entirely upside-down.And remember the incredibly fast start that the Orioles put together in 2012 in getting out to a 19-9 record by early May? That would not have been predicted by the spring season where they were 11-13.However, when you\xe2\x80\x99re bad, you\xe2\x80\x99re just bad \xe2\x80\xa6 like the 2008 Orioles. They were dead last in Florida at 10-17, and then they proved they were a poor team by finishing last in the AL East that year with 68 wins total.And to consider another team, the very best record just a year ago in the Grapefruit League was turned in by the Tampa Bay Rays.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsWhat is the story with the Baltimore Orioles and Brian Matusz going into the 2015 season? He has had reasonably good success as a reliever, particularly in the second half of last year. But the Orioles are stretching him out this spring and are even going to give him a start today (Saturday) against the Tampa Bay Rays.This seems odd. It is not like the Orioles need more starters; they already have at least one too many. And T.J. McFarland is the presumed long-man lefty, having been very effective in this role.This seems odd. It is not like the Orioles need more starters; they already have at least one too many. And T.J. McFarland is the presumed long-man lefty, having been very effective in this role.The official line coming from Buck Showalter is that this will allow Matusz to work on all of his pitches in an extended outing. And that could certainly be a benefit. As well, it does not hurt at all to have bullpen pitchers able to pitch more than one inning.I frankly do not think tossing multiple innings is expected and accomplished anywhere near enough throughout the sport in this era. That is a valuable skill. If the first reliever in the game in the sixth or seventh innings throws only eight or nine pitches and looks very good, why not send him back out for a few more batters. Every time there is a change of pitchers, there is the risk of introducing someone who might not be going to have his best stuff.But back to Matusz: the suspicion is that the Orioles may be stretching him out as trade bait for a late preseason move to a team needing additional pitching help. I will opine that, though I think the reasons listed above are genuine in the thinking of the organization, I do believe this is an additional potential reason. I have written on this theme several times in past months, as have others.Additionally, Roch Kubatko wrote yesterday of an interesting health issue that Matusz has been dealing with for some time. Apparently a history of moderately high blood pressure had elevated to a significantly high level, necessitating a prescriptive intervention. Matusz reports feeling the best he has in several years, speaking of previous times where he would feel exhausted even with sufficient sleep. There is of course the commonly-known accompanying issue of some measure of anxiety with elevated blood pressure.Could this account for some of the excessive, nervous activity seen in Matusz on the mound? He never looks comfortable and has a variety of nervous twitches, habits, and stretches (though this is far from rare among MLB players). Matusz also often looks unusually flushed in the face when pitching, frequently sweating profusely in spite of the weather conditions. Could this all be related?Matusz has had both the best of times and the worst of times with the Orioles. Early on in his career he had games as a starter where he completely controlled the opposing lineup. But then came the horrific season of 2011 before being sent to the bullpen.Though there have been some occasional struggles as a reliever, the overall picture has been quite positive. Opponents were a combined 14-for-80 (.175) in July, August and September last year.

An inning later Steve Pearce would knotch his first homer of the spring to bring the Orioles to within 3-2, however that\xe2\x80\x99s as close as they would get. With the loss, the Orioles fell to 3-10 on the spring.The main story of the game for the Birds was probably Brian Matusz, who still believes he can be a starter. As he told Michal Kolligian of orioles.com, the only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s different between starting and relieving is the routine:It was really just a matter of relearning the pregame routine of when to get out, when to start playing catch and things like that. It was nice to have guys like [Chris] Tillman around to help.It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear what Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s plan is regarding Matusz; are the Orioles planning on making him a long man of sorts? Or are they looking to showcase him a bit in hopes of including him in a trade?Going back to the offense, the good news was that the two guys who wereCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsresponsible for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 runs were regular players. (Or in Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s case let\xe2\x80\x99s say a semi-regular player.) However while the losses aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily a problem, the one glaring issue in these games in my mind has been the lack of run suport. And make no mistake about the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m not referring to games such as Friday\xe2\x80\x99s5-3 loss to Toronto \xe2\x80\x93 very few regulars were in that game.Let\xe2\x80\x99s just say that it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair to look at these games the same way we would a regular season game. We have to be as analytical as possible in the sense that players are being told to focus on various things throughout their outings in spring games. Through the first week or so of games, I noticed a lot of players fouling off numerous pitches down the lines. Sometimes these balls would go into the stands, and sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99d end up as outs.But now as we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to reach the mid-point of spring training, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing more drives to the outfield. This should tell us that guys\xe2\x80\x99 timing is starting to come back. Oriole bats have often been a bit impatient at the plate, swining at a lot of first pitches which have induced outs. But while that needs to change a bit, keep in mind that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are a free-swinging team \xe2\x80\x93 that was part of their luster in 2014. So while the one \xe2\x80\x9cglaring\xe2\x80\x9d issue I see right now (if it can even be called that after 13 spring games) is the offensive output, I also think that we\xe2\x80\x99ll start to see the offense click as we progress into the latter part of the spring.I also want to send out a congratulatory note to an Oriole prospect, Patrick Connaughton. He was selected by the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the fourth round of last year\xe2\x80\x99s draft, and was sent to short-seaon class-A Aberdeen. Connaughton is also a member of the Notre Dame men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball team, who defeated North Carolina last night to win it\xe2\x80\x99s first ever ACC title.\xc2\xa0Without going off on a tangent about this, most local fans will probably love the fact that an Oriole prospect helped his team defeat North Carolina. For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, Notre Dame\xe2\x80\x99s head coach, Mike Brey, is also a Maryland native.The O\xe2\x80\x99s will travel up the road to Bradenton this afternoon to take on the Pittsburgh Pirates. Wei-Yin Chen will make the start for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Pittsburgh\xe2\x80\x99s Vance Worley.  ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles move Rey Navarro, Matt Tuiasosopo to minor league ...', "" At least one of the Orioles' few roster battles became a little bit more clear on Sunday afternoon. Before the team's exhibition game against the Pirates got underway, they announced two cuts. Outfielder Matt Tuiasosopo was reassignd to the minor league camp and infielder Rey Navarro was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk.    When the Orioles signed Navarro back in November, he seemed like a player who might compete with Ryan Flaherty for the utility infielder role. However, much later in the offseason, the Orioles added a more experienced player once a pending legal matter resolved, so it seemed like Navarro was probably a bit farther out of the picture. Sure enough, with three weeks left in spring training, Navarro has been sent down to the minors. In 12 at-bats over 12 games so far in spring games, Navarro batted .333/.385/.583. Small sample size, of course. Manager Buck Showalter told reporters that Navarro would probably end up as the starting second baseman at Norfolk. That likely makes him injury insurance, which is important, if not exciting, to have. Tuiasosopo, a non-roster invitee, never looked like much more than camp filler. With an already-crowded outfield situation, there wasn't much chance that he would break through onto the roster. He got to the plate 11 times in eight games and did not record a hit. That makes it even harder to force his way to the top. But who knows, maybe he'll awaken into the next Nate McLouth, somehow.    These two cuts bring the Orioles camp roster down to 49 players, including 11 non-roster invitees. They are expected to make some more cuts tomorrow.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The Orioles defeated the Red Sox 7-2.Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIn the quest of the Baltimore Orioles to find outfielders, particularly in the loss of Nick Markakis and Nelson Cruz, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have had a total of 15 in major league camp for this 2015 spring training. A number of these are destined for the minor leagues and are being given a MLB experience, like Mike Yastrzemski and Glenn Davis. Yet quite a number of other players are on, or near, the proverbial bubble as they battle to come in off the fringe.The Orioles are likely to carry six outfielders, and five of that number are rather certain, barring some injury or unforeseen circumstance: Adam Jones, Alejandro De Aza, Steve Pearce, Travis Snider and Delmon Young.The one extra position would be most often presumed to go to David Lough. But this is not a definitive decision or scenario. A number of others could possibly slip into that spot or be ready in the event of a need \xe2\x80\x93 which is likely to happen at some point. And beyond that, three of the five \xe2\x80\x9clocks\xe2\x80\x9d mentioned above are free agents at the end of this season, so there is much to play for in order to be well-positioned for 2016.I thought it might be interesting to seek to gain an evaluation of those outfielders closest to the majors by comparing them (as much as is possible) at the relative same level of play \xe2\x80\xa6 choosing to look at their career statistics at AAA, beginning with David Lough.NameAgeGames.Avg.OBPHRDavid Lough29401.295.34833Henry Urrutia2880.286.3112Dariel Alvarez2644.301.3281Julio Borbon29402.298.35517Nolan Reimold31164.274.37925Chris Parmelee27141.295.39527\xc2\xa0Though the numbers of games played at AAA varies, it is striking as to how relatively similar are the batting averages. The lowest by Reimold at .274 is offset by his .379 OBP.\xc2\xa0 And I would not have expected Parmelee to have such good numbers, so one can see why a franchise would want to give such a player a chance to break through.

Right now he is 3-for-18.The two Cuban outfielders are quite the rage in the minds of many, but when put on a chart like this, their relative lack of power does stand out.A strategy of the Orioles is to stockpile players who were high draft choices at one time and who have had some success, even if it has not been sustained \xe2\x80\x93 all the while hoping for them to break out.

""Never trust a reliever"" is an old adage in baseball, and it\'s one that Dan Duquette has taken to heart. \xc2\xa02015 is just the latest year where Duquette has stockpiled relief arms, choosing to let folks sink or swim in spring training, and build up some depth in the system for the slog of a major league season. \xc2\xa0The unusual twist this year is that two of the guys competing in camp are Rule 5 picks, who cannot be stashed in the minors, which makes the Opening Day decisions that much more interesting. The Locks Considering the way I described the battle above, it may be strange to see that the Orioles have four absolute locks for their seven (or eight?) bullpen spots. \xc2\xa0But nonetheless, it\'s almost impossible, barring injury, to imagine that the Orioles don\'t open their season with Zach Britton as closer, and Tommy Hunter and Darren O\'Day as his top setup men. \xc2\xa0It\'s probably easier for the fans to imagine a bullpen without Brian Matusz, but I nonetheless list him here because if the Orioles planned to cut bait with him, they wouldn\'t have tendered him a contract this offseason. \xc2\xa0If he isn\'t traded, expect to see him suit up on Opening Day. The Battle So the Orioles really have a slew of guys in camp competing for the last three slots in the bullpen. \xc2\xa0In general, two of those slots are for short relievers and one is to be the long man in the \'pen. \xc2\xa0Below, I handicap the contenders in the order of likelihood as I\'d view them.    After being acquired from the Padres before the 2014 season, Brad Brach had the best season of his career for the Orioles. \xc2\xa0Used in a variety of fairly low-leverage roles, including some long appearances for the first time in his career, Brach put up a decent 3.18 ERA with a solid 1.171 WHIP. \xc2\xa0His strikeouts were off a bit from his career line, but his walks were even further down. \xc2\xa0To top all of that off, Brach is out of minor league options. \xc2\xa0He\'s not quite a lock, but he\'s the next closest thing.       When the Orioles acquired Ryan Webb last year, it was viewed as a positive signing, a cheap groundballer who could replace the departed Jim Johnson. \xc2\xa0And while Webb certainly outperformed Johnson\'s implosive 2014, he wasn\'t the guy the Orioles thought they were getting. \xc2\xa0He struggled for extended periods and even got shuffled off of the 25-man roster and demoted in August. \xc2\xa0The season ended with a pedestrian 3.83 ERA and 1.257 WHIP for Webb, although if you look around the edges, there were good signs in his walk rate and BABIP. \xc2\xa0Webb is struggling with a knee injury in spring training, but the Orioles are on the hook for almost $3 million for Webb\'s services in 2015, and probably want to see what they can get out of that. Wesley Wright is one of this year\'s newcomers. \xc2\xa0When the Orioles snagged him after he was non-tendered by the Cubs, many assumed or hoped that the new lefty reliever presaged a Brian Matusz trade. \xc2\xa0But here we are, three weeks from Opening Day, with both Matusz and Wright in camp. \xc2\xa0Wright is tough against lefties, and unlike Matusz, passable against right-handed batters as well. \xc2\xa0But if the Orioles hang on to Matusz, it gets harder for Wright to find his way into a crowded bullpen picture if the team hangs on to its Rule 5 picks.    The first of those Rule 5 picks is Logan Verrett, who profiles as more of a long arm (perhaps even a future starter). Taken from the Mets in the Rule 5 draft, Verrett spent last year in AAA, logging a 4.33 ERA in the hitter-friendly Pacific Coast League, in 28 starts. \xc2\xa0Verrett\'s primary competition for the swing man spot would be T.J. McFarland, who I would have listed much higher on this list, but who the Orioles are reportedly planning to send to AAA to develop as a starter following his impressive 2014. \xc2\xa0Otherwise, Verrett would mainly be displaced by one of the Orioles\' six starters, mainly if Ubaldo Jimenez is the odd man out of the starting rotation (since Miguel Gonzalez and Kevin Gausman could just be sent to AAA). \xc2\xa0Verrett must be kept on the active roster for all of 2015, or be returned to the Mets. The other Rule 5 pick in camp is Jason Garcia, and while he\'s received rave reviews for his raw stuff, he\'s never pitched above high-A ball. \xc2\xa0He would be a long shot to make the roster, considering again that he\'d have to stick there all year if the team wants to hold on to him. \xc2\xa0After Garcia, you move on to longer shots, like AAA farmhand Tyler Wilson, or Steve Johnson, back in the fold on a minor league deal, and even the ageless wonder Mark Hendrickson, back in camp for what seems like the eighth time. There\'s always a chance the Orioles open the season with an eight-man bullpen, rather than the standard seven, if they choose to do a little bit of roster manipulation, perhaps stashing a fifth starter in AAA until he\'s needed in mid-April because of the team\'s early off days. \xc2\xa0But eventually, the dust will settle, and the Orioles will most likely be choosing between Webb and Wright, and possibly deciding whether they can protect Verrett for the whole season or would be better off recalling McFarland, or letting Jimenez work on his form in low-leverage mop-up duty. \xc2\xa0Part of never trusting relievers is never having too many relievers, but the Orioles have put themselves in an interesting position by not giving themselves as much roster flexibility as you\'d usually expect from Duquette.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('2015 season preview: Baltimore Orioles - Camden Chat', ' The Orioles could win the World Series this year. They probably won\'t, because only one team can win the World Series. That leaves 29 teams who won\'t win. A team can be good or great and still run into a better or luckier team somewhere on the way to a championship. The O\'s know this as well as anyone, running as they did into a luckier team in the ALCS, bringing a magical season to a screeching halt. They could win, though, which is more than Orioles fans could truthfully tell themselves through many dark seasons not too long ago.    There\'s never an easy time in winning the American League East, either. Last year\'s Orioles worked hard and played well to do so. It wasn\'t easy even though they won by 12 games. Maybe it was a so-called down year for the division as the O\'s trounced their way to that 12-game triumph over their nearest competitors. Funny how it\'s never a down year when the Yankees or Red Sox win the division. Maybe it wasn\'t a down year. Maybe the Orioles were just that good. Few credited them for being so good. Fewer still give them much chance of repeating as champions, though the only significant on-field contributor to leave the team was Nelson Cruz. The usual haters buzz as they circle above, waiting to plummet down towards the surface and strafe the team, metaphorically speaking. Their aim has been off for the last three years.     They\'re picking us last again, which is beautiful.-Orioles manager Buck Showalter   The stars are otherwise all back. Some who were not significant contributors last year due to injury will be back: Manny Machado, returning from a knee injury; Matt Wieters, returning from Tommy John surgery; Chris Davis, who blames last year on a nagging oblique injury that he says is now healthy. If these three are good players for the 2015 Orioles, not many people save the sentimentalists will be sparing a thought for the departed.    Can they do it again? They did it once, so why not twice? Many things will have to go right to repeat as division champions. A solid starting rotation must continue to be so. A great bullpen must maintain its place among the best in the league. Reliever volatility being what it is, that\'s a tough thing to expect from what could prove to be almost the exact same group of players, minus midseason trade acquisition Andrew Miller, who will be in the back end of the rival Yankees bullpen instead.    On the other side of the ball, they will need a power-filled lineup to stay towards the top of the league. No one hit more home runs than the Orioles last year. The mile-high Rockies were the only team to come within 25. Cruz, who hit 40 of those home runs, is gone. You could take away his 40 home runs last year and the Orioles would have still been third in home runs in MLB. They could still have the makings of a great offense. That\'s a lot that must go right for the O\'s to repeat. Each and every team needs a lot of things to go right. Perhaps this is the year there will be late October baseball at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Stranger things have happened.    CH-CH-CH-CH-CHANGES Departures: Nelson Cruz, Nick Markakis, Andrew Miller, Nick Hundley Arrivals: Travis Snider, Rule 5 picks Logan Verrett, Jason Garcia (if either makes the team) It\'s not exactly an overwhelming list of additions for the O\'s, especially considering their division rival Red Sox went out and spent hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire the likes of Pablo Sandoval, Hanley Ramirez, and Cuban sensation Yoan Moncada. Then again, the Red Sox were 25 games behind the Orioles in the standings in 2014 last year. They were the ones with ground to make up.    The Orioles are content to give this whole thing one more ride with a core of players who\'ve won 274 games over the past three seasons. They have 12 pending free agents.

The Orioles are not likely to have a six-man rotation during the season, but how they\'re going to cut it down to five by the end of spring training is an open question.

Neither move would be heartening to Orioles fans.      Ubaldo Jimenez. Photo credit: Bob DeChiara, USA Today Sports       The presence of Jimenez, the Orioles\' $50 million pitcher who is signed through 2017, is a complication to picking the five best starters purely on the merits. What they will do with him is another question mark facing the team. Take him away from the picture and you have a rotation full of pitchers with low-to-mid 3 ERAs. That\'s not going to get them any Cy Young votes, but it is something that would be the envy of many teams. Three of these unremarkable starters went toe-to-toe with three Tigers Cy Young winners in the ALDS last year, facing a potent Tigers offense. We know how that turned out.

That just doesn\'t happen. Even good relief pitchers don\'t tend to be that good from year to year. If these two step in a more pedestrian direction, even while still being very good, that\'s a problem that this year\'s Orioles would have to contend with. If this occurs, will the rest of the relievers be able to be better to compensate for a step back from the back end? It\'s possible the projected bullpen will not end up being the final bullpen. Wright is another lefty reliever who\'s signed to a $1.7 million contract, so he\'s not exactly DFA bait. Still, he\'d probably only make the team if Matusz is freed in a trade to another team to pursue his destiny of winning a National League Cy Young award. Verrett, picked in the Rule 5 draft out of the Mets organization, figures to profile as a long reliever. If he impresses enough, that could bump McFarland down to the Norfolk rotation. Garcia is from the Red Sox organization and has never pitched above High-A before. That\'s a long-shot to make a big league bullpen. If he did, that would probably mean someone got hurt or one of the middle relief tandem of Brach or Webb were traded or released.

They are tinkering with a lot of different things in spring training, including having Davis get some outfield innings. Pearce could play some first base. Snider, Lough, and De Aza are all left-handed outfielders. How are they going to work all of this out? The brain trust of manager Buck Showalter and GM Dan Duquette surely have some kind of plan in mind. If they\'re right about its ability to work, then the Orioles will have found themselves yet another unconventional way to succeed in the present era of baseball. If it doesn\'t work, there will be a lot of midseason tinkering. De Aza probably won\'t duplicate a hot September he spent with the Orioles. Does Pearce have a second strong season in him? Would his numbers decline if he was a full-time player rather than a part-time player? We can ask the same questions about Young, who went shopping for a multi-year deal on the free agent market but ended up back in Baltimore, where he delivered the greatest Orioles hit of the 21st century.    There will probably be a lot of midseason tinkering even if it all does work. That\'s how Duquette operates. However, not many players on this team, hitters or pitchers, have options with which for Duquette to work his magic this year. Barring injuries, the roster may be the roster, for better or worse. For O\'s fans, it\'s hopefully better. TOP PROSPECTS Hunter Harvey - Picking in the middle of the first round, rather than towards the top, for the first time in 15 years, the Orioles grabbed this right-handed pitcher out of a North Carolina high school in the 2013 draft. There was no doubt he\'d sign; he told reporters on an introductory conference call that he hated school and he\'d been working his whole life to play professional baseball. The son of former MLB closer Bryan Harvey, the younger Harvey showed up in the Orioles system, flashed greater velocity than he had as an amateur, and quickly improved his stock with the prospect-industrial complex. This year, Harvey\'s been invited to big league spring training. As he\'s never pitched above Low-A Delmarva, it\'s just for the experience. He\'s shown off a brand new splitter. Baseball Prospectus rates him the #20 prospect in all of baseball. His potential impact for the franchise won\'t be immediate, but there\'s hope that his future is bright.     ...a plus-plus fastball, an elite cutter that some think could possess religious properties...-Fmr. Baseball Prospectus writer Jason Parks on Bundy (Dec. 2013)   Dylan Bundy - Rated as high as the #2 prospect in all of baseball by Baseball America and MLB.com prior to the 2013 season, Bundy now has generated much more divided reviews since having to get Tommy John surgery in the middle of that season. BA has lowered him to #48, while MLB puts him #20. The BPro crowd are still believers, rating him as the #8 prospect, but there are still quesiton marks about if or how well his former arsenal will return now that we\'re approaching two years out from the surgery.    Bundy doesn\'t figure to have much impact on the 2015 Orioles season either. He\'s expected to start the season with Double-A Bowie and even if the Orioles find themselves needing a starting pitcher at the MLB level, Bundy would have to show them he\'s ready first. They would probably tap Mike Wright or Tyler Wilson from Norfolk instead. Bundy did not overwhelm in his first action after the surgery at High-A Frederick last year. Though his short-term impact isn\'t large, Bundy returning to something close to the form that he showed when the Orioles drafted him #4 overall in 2011 would give the Orioles a potent weapon in the rotation going forward.

Rebilas, USA Today Sports Jimenez returns to the form that shows why the Orioles invested so much money in him, Gausman starts to tap into some of the elite potential that had him rate highly as a prospect, and the rest of the rotation continues to be solid or better. Britton, O\'Day, and Hunter form a powerful trio at the back end of the bullpen. The Orioles ride all of these things through the regular season, to another division title over their big-spending rivals, into the World Series and to their first championship in my lifetime. THE GLASS HALF-EMPTY The clubhouse, disgruntled at the business decision not to re-sign Markakis at any cost, falls apart. Multiple elbows or shoulders blow out. The Orioles do something stupid like send Gausman to the minor leagues while riding a terrible Jimenez for 25 starts or more. Davis is still bad this year because it turns out it wasn\'t his oblique after all. Machado somehow requires a third knee surgery as Orioles fans sadly realize he\'ll be yet another Orioles prospect who might have had a great career. The entire bullpen explodes at once because that\'s what happens to relievers from year-to-year. They make another Scott Feldman-esque panic trade and give up on a struggling player too soon who goes on to blossom elsewhere. They limp to a 75-win season and all the smug know-it-alls who\'ve been wrong about the team for three straight seasons won\'t stop crowing about how they were right all along, the Orioles were just unsustainably lucky, even though they\'re wrong, but with an unsuccessful most recent season, there will be no telling those morons to shut up. Everyone good leaves in free agency. The Red Sox, Royals, or Nationals win the World Series. THE BOTTOM LINE The Orioles tell PECOTA, Fangraphs, and all the rest to put it in their coffee and stir it for a fourth straight season. That probably doesn\'t mean they\'ll win the World Series, or even necessarily a playoff series, because those things are hard even for good teams. With a returning rotation with another year under their belts, a pitching staff backed up by what figures to be an elite infield defense and a capable outfield defense once again, they\'re poised to surprise everyone who counted them out because they didn\'t make any splashes in free agency that they\'d regret later. Another fun summer in Baltimore awaits. My prediction: 89-73, with the Orioles on the road in the AL Wild Card Game Although if they keep losing their way through the Grapefruit League with an anemic offense, even though it doesn\'t matter, in a couple of weeks I\'ll be singing a much different tune.

However Steve PearceCourtesy of Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sportsmanaged to tie the game with a two-run homer in the sixth inning which tied the game.Pittsburgh would put two runs across in the last of the eighth to give them a 4-2 lead, and ultimately a victory over the Birds. The Orioles could have avoided those two runs, however Evereth Cabrera bobbled a ground ball that probably would have been a double play. Cabrera has not had the best spring thus far in the field. Having said that, it\xe2\x80\x99s small details as such that a manager like Buck Showalter will look to in a game. However fans should also bear in mind that we\xe2\x80\x99re only just barely at the midpoint of Grapefruit League play. Things can certainly improve.The game was also highlighted by a few sparkling plays defensively in the field for the Birds, including a diving catch by Julio Borbon in center, and Manny Machado fielding a bunt on the fly and doubling up a runner at first base. Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s details such as these which register in Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s no decision that needs to be made on Manny Machado per se, but I digress.The Orioles also got some positive news in that they announced that Matt Wieters will make his spring debut behind the plate on Tuesday in Sarasota against Minnesota. Wieters of course is in an 0-for-20 slump at the plate, however he\xe2\x80\x99s yet to debut behind the dish.

The choices are the incumbent, the short-timer, and the newcomer.After the original angst over the Everth Cabrera signing and the fact he may start over Jonathan Schoop, that seems to have passed.\xc2\xa0 Schoop isn\xe2\x80\x99t having a great spring, but his glove looks excellent. He is only hitting .192, with no walks and eight strikeouts, which is a cause for concern, but his defense alone will win him the 2B job.Cabrera has done some good things offensively, especially with the running game and drawing walks. Sitting at a .286 average, Cabrera has four walks, a triple and a double. However, his defense has been highly suspect. And that is the one thing where Cabrera was held in high regard previously.Ryan Flaherty is hitting .167, with three hits (all singles) in 20 at-bats.\xc2\xa0 He has one RBI and has struck out five times. Now, one does not have to worry about his glove.\xc2\xa0 However, his arm playing third base and the outfield is a bit of a question.Then there is Jimmy Paredes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest, I\xe2\x80\x99m a Paredes supporter. I know last year his defense was suspect, but he is a guy who can play multiple positions who can hit the ball.And he has certainly done that this spring. Jimmy has the team\xe2\x80\x99s best batting average for anyone with more than four at-bats, at .429. He also has scored three runs, has seven RBIs, and three doubles. And only two strikeouts.But, what has been most impressive is his defense. He has always had a decent arm, but his glove is much improved from last year.\xc2\xa0 Buck Showalter has spoken several times about how good Paredes looks in the field.

With a backup catcher, and probably two back up outfielders, that only leaves room for one utility player. In addition, only one of these players is out of options. That is Paredes.I believe that on Opening Day, both Paredes and Cabrera make the roster. Then, once Chris Davis returns the next day, one of these players will be sent to the minors or designated for assignment (if it is Paredes). If he continues to play good defense, I think Paredes just might stick in Baltimore to start the year.Do you agree?\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

How do all of those pitchers get fit into the bullpen?Buck Showalter said that for Opening Day he only plans on carrying 11 or 12 pitchers. Let\xe2\x80\x99s assume it is 12, because if it is 11, that likely means that eventually the bullpen will be expanding.In addition, let us assume that Chris Tillman, Wei-Yin Chen, Miguel Gonzalez, Bud Norris and Kevin Gausman are in the rotation. Yes, I think Ubaldo Jimenez is headed for the bullpen.We know that Zach Britton, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, and Tommy Hunter all will be making up the back end of the bullpen.

However, I anticipate the Orioles making a trade to keep him in the organization.I think McFarland is headed for AAA. T.J. needs to be pitching long innings, enough to be a starter. With Ubaldo as the long reliever, that won\xe2\x80\x99t happen in the majors. \xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoDifferently, I think Brad Brach is in the bullpen.\xc2\xa0 He has pitched well this spring, and certainly had an excellent year in 2014. That leaves two spots open for Ryan Webb, Wesley Wright, Brian Matusz and Logan Verrett.I think that both Matusz and Wesley Wright make the bullpen. As for Mike Wright, he looks like he could certainly be a piece for the Orioles, but not yet.Welsey Wright gives the Orioles a second lefty in the bullpen, and Matusz gives them a third. Let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, as much as Orioles fans like to bash Matusz because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match up to some of the other relievers statistically, he has been pretty good.\xc2\xa0 Especially as a lefty specialist.\xc2\xa0 And, for a team with only one lefty starter, it is important to have several left-handers in the bullpen.Webb has no options, and I think it is safe to say his time in Baltimore could be over.\xc2\xa0 He has been inconsistent since coming to Baltimore from the Miami Marlins, and the team just has so many other options.That leaves just Logan Verrett. One way that Verrett could make this team is if Brian Matusz is traded. Two days ago, fellow writer Randy Buchman discussed that here.\xc2\xa0 Well, the Orioles could trade Matusz to the Mets, as rumored, for Verrett and another piece.This would allow the team to send Verrett to the minors. Currently, as a Rule 5 player he has to be on the major league 25-man roster. It would allow the team to keep a player they really like.My one concern with this is the lack of left-handers in the bullpen.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles first baseman Chris Davis has three home runs this spring. The first two were three-run shots that powered the Birds to two of their too-few victories in Florida. They also inspired the main idea of this article \xe2\x80\x93 that when Chris Davis hits home runs, the O\xe2\x80\x99s win a high percentage of those games.So it stands to reason that he yesterday hit a solo shot in the 10-9 loss to the Twins. Although, honestly, when you score nine runs, your team really should win the game.Though it is certainly true that there is no single statistic or person that carries a baseball team to victory, a big home run bat goes a long way in a lineup. Even so, all the great hitting in the world will not produce a championship team if the pitching staff is among the worst in the league. And the inverse is true as well.But it does remain a fact that when the primary power hitter on a given team does what he does best, which is drive the ball to places where it cannot be caught, his team\xe2\x80\x99s chances of winning that game are exponentially higher than games where he fails to hit it out of the park.Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at Davis\xe2\x80\x99 home runs over the past two years, comparing the team\xe2\x80\x99s winning percentage in those game relative to the whole season\xe2\x80\xa6In 2014, Davis hit 26 home runs in 23 games. The Orioles won 18 of those games, which equals a percentage of .783 versus the team\xe2\x80\x99s .593 for the season.In 2013, Davis hit 53 home runs in 50 games. The Orioles won 31 of those games, which equals a percentage of .620 versus the team\xe2\x80\x99s .531 for the season.

It is likely most often true of the primary slugger on most teams. Here are a few examples, beginning with Nelson Cruz in 2014, who hit 40 home runs in 37 games. The Orioles won 26 of those games, which equals a percentage of .703 versus the team\xe2\x80\x99s .593 for the season.In Miguel Cabrera\xe2\x80\x99s MVP season of 2012, he hit 44 home runs in 39 games. The Tigers won 29 of those games, which equals a percentage of .744 versus the team\xe2\x80\x99s .543 for the season.Does this observation hold true as well for a losing team? Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at Chris Carter and the Astros last year. Carter hit 37 home runs in 30 games, with Houston being 18-12 in those games \xe2\x80\xa6 so .600 versus a team winning percentage of .432.\xc2\xa0 Yes, Carter had seven games with a pair of homers, and the Astros were 5-2 in those contests. (Actually, when researching this, teams almost never lose a game when their team-leading HR hitter has multiple long balls.)Here is another slugger from 2014 \xe2\x80\x93 Jose Abreu of the White Sox. His 36 home runs were hit in 32 games with a team record of 20-12, .625 \xe2\x80\xa6 whereas Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s team win percentage was .451.I admit this is pretty far from complex sabermetrics. But it does in simple form present the value of a primary slugger on a team and that team\xe2\x80\x99s chances of winning games. By any measure or any standard, the Orioles need Chris Davis to have a big year and power them toward a significant number of victories.To finish off the totals for Davis as an Oriole, in 2012 games the Birds were 21-9 when he homered. His two homers as an Oriole in 2011 were in wins. So, for his career in Baltimore, when Chris Davis hits a home run, the Orioles win 68.6% of those games (72-33).

Showalter was very quick to say that this was normal, and that they had almost expected this. Wieters is under the care of Dr. James Andrews, and this is the course of action that was suggested. Showalter went on to say that Wieters might be available to DH a soon as Sunday.Let\xe2\x80\x99s be frank; Tommy John surgery is nothing to laugh at. Perhaps it is somewhat surprising that there\xe2\x80\x99s been nothing o this nature that\xe2\x80\x99s happened as of yet, however that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that Orioles fans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be concerned. Fans should also keep in mind that medical issues as such are never a sure thing when it comes to timing. Furthermore, I suspect it\xe2\x80\x99s also questionable as to whether or not this would be something he would have played through had this been the regular season.According to Roch Kubatko of MASNsports, Showalter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear overly concerned:It was something we were all kind of expecting at some point. We all kind of thought if we back off a little bit, we\xe2\x80\x99ve a long time yet. We\xe2\x80\x99re only halfway through the spring training season.Having said that, I gaurantee that Showalter and the coaching staff are probably re-evaluating their options at catcher in terms of who would be staying with the team if Wieters is on the DL come opening day. My guess would be that Caleb Joseph would be the starting catcher, with Steve Clevenger as the backup.Time will tell whether or not this is truly an issue or not. Wieters of course is famously 0-for-23 at the plate in spring training, so perhaps this will also give him some time to get his swing straight. The Orioles return home to Sarasota this afternoon for another meeting with Pittsburgh. Chris Tillman will be on the mound for the Orioles today. Opposite of Tillman will be a familiar name to Orioles fans, as Radamus Liz takes to the hill for Pittsburgh.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Wieters' tendinitis means get Plan B ready  "", 'birdswatcher.com')]"
03/20/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Top 5 Surprises of Spring Training', 'Fans of the Baltimore Orioles are reminded over and over to not fall in love with spring training statistics. This statement is often followed with a reminder of the incredible home run outburst of catcher Jake Fox a few years ago.Yet at the same time, if a player (particularly on the fringe) does not put up some numbers and make an impression, he is going to be riding in a bus for the summer around some part of the country and sleeping in a variety of sometimes sketchy hotels.So who are the Orioles players who are excelling this spring in ways that might not have been fully anticipated?Let me list five of them:#1 \xe2\x80\x93 Jimmy Paredes It is not a total revelation that Paredes can hit a baseball. But right now he is hitting at a .423 pace over 15 games with nine RBIs. He has three doubles, a triple and a home run to his credit as well.Playing for the Orioles seems to agree with Paredes who did a nice job at the end of the season last year, hitting .302 in 18 games. His career average is however at .242, with an OBP of .279 \xe2\x80\x93 though it is only in a total of 145 games and 430 at-bats. The 26-year old is a career .289 hitter in the minor leagues.His defense is reported to have improved over the past offseason, and it would appear that the Orioles are trying to find a way to explore his full flexibility by testing his potential in the outfield.It still seems to me to be a difficult scenario to keep him, but I honestly also never imagined that Paredes would even be in this conversation or in an article of this topic.

And though he has cooled off in the most recent games after a torrid start, it remains encouraging to see him so healthy and moving so well. He has even stolen a couple bases.Manny is putting some good swings on the ball and simply looking fine. There is no reason to not expect a very good year \xe2\x80\xa6 so long as the knees hold up.#3 \xe2\x80\x93 Nolan ReimoldHaving been a long-time Reimold apologist, I am not surprised to see him playing well now that his health has truly, really, honestly, finally, for-sure returned. We are again able to see the ball as it explodes off his bat, along with the incredible speed from the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box to first base \xe2\x80\x93 among the best in the sport.Reimold is 6-for-19 this spring with a home run. However, he also has five additional walks for an OBP of .458 \xe2\x80\x93 something the Baltimore Orioles desperately need.Again, as with Paredes, it is difficult to see a scenario develop that would involve Nolan going north in April. But if he can continue to play like this, he is going to be at Camden Yards this year. That would be awesome to see.#4 \xe2\x80\x93 Logan Verrett This Rule 5 Draftee is doing what a team wants from such a selection by giving every indication that he is worthy of the risk associated with retaining him for the season on the 25-man roster. So far Verrett has pitched nine innings in five games, posting an ERA of 2.00 and WHIP of 1.11, while also registering two saves. He looks good.His AAA numbers from last year are far from amazing: 11-5 with a 4.33 ERA and WHIP of 1.37 \xe2\x80\xa6 though we must factor into this that these numbers are from the Pacific Coast League that is known as a huge hitters\xe2\x80\x99 paradise.It might help a great deal if his former team, the New York Mets, was to trade him as part of a deal for Brian Matusz \xe2\x80\x93 another Oriole who has pitched well thus far in Florida.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago#5 \xe2\x80\x93 Henry Urrutia I am only surprised that Urrutia is doing well in light of the difficult season he endured in 2014, though most of that was due to injury. At the end of 2013, he had proven he could hit well at AA and AAA and in the Arizona Fall League.Though he had a decent spring last year, he is putting up better numbers this season. So far Urrutia is 8-for-22 with two doubles and a massive home run. He has also walked three times and only struck out twice. His defense is much improved.Last year Urrutia seemed to be personally crushed when he did not make the team going north, and then the injury soon followed. So it was encouraging to read these remarks in an interview yesterday with Steve Melewski of MASN:\xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard (to make this team). But I feel strong and healthy and good at the plate. \xc2\xa0Last year, I was thinking too much, \xe2\x80\x98Make the team, make the team.\xe2\x80\x99 This year, I have a little more experience so when spring training is done, Showalter and the general manager have to make the decision.\xe2\x80\x9dNext: Matt Wieters and Opening Day?

He posted a 3.48 ERA with a 2-3 overall record in 51 2/3 innings of relief. However, with former Oriole and left-handed reliever Andrew Miller leaving to play for the Yankees in New York, the Orioles need Matusz to be that shutdown left-hander coming out of the bullpen this upcoming season.And, if he keeps up having great outings like today, then he will do just that. However, watch out because Matusz was a starter earlier in his playing career with the Orioles. If he shows he can pitch 6-7 strong innings, then do not put it past Showalter to revisit the possibility of Matusz going back to his roots as a starter.Next: Baltimore Orioles win on Henry Urrutia's bat  "", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('M.L.B.

03/22/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Spring Training Disappointments', 'Mar 17, 2015; Sarasota, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Bud Norris (25) throws a pitch in the first inning of the spring training game against the Minnesota Twins at Ed Smith Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY SportsA couple of days ago I wrote an article on the top five Baltimore Orioles players so far in spring training. It would make sense to next write on the top five disappointments in Florida. But just as intoxicating as good statistics can be in the spring, so also can negative numbers be indicative of practically next to nothing. A player might be hitting line drives right at defenders over and over. Or a veteran may be looking to particularly address an area of weakness or attempt a new technique in a safe environment.At the same time, a growing lack of results can begin to ring a few bells of concern. It would certainly look like the following four players are in trouble in terms of having any possibility of a good season of production \xe2\x80\xa6GABHRBIHRAvgPlayer 11127731.226Player 2924321.125Player 31658611.103Player 41148421.083\xc2\xa0Player 1 is Adam Jones. Is this something to worry about? Not really. Jones is certainly a big-time player when it counts; he gets the job done. Of spring numbers he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone really looks at spring training numbers, look at Greg Maddux\xe2\x80\x98s spring training over his career. I think when the lights turn on and it matters most, that\xe2\x80\x99s when it counts. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think spring numbers really matter to me.\xe2\x80\x9dPlayer 2 is Alejandro De Aza. Certainly after coming over from the White Sox last year, he put up some wonderful numbers that were extremely helpful for the Orioles at the end of the season. De Aza hit for an average of .293 over 20 games, getting 24 base hits including 11 of them for extra bases. But his spring start has been a bit slow, and he went home to the Dominican Republic for three days this week for a 99th birthday gathering for his grandfather.Player 3 is Nelson Cruz. The numbers are not from spring training in any season. It is simply a sample of what he produced from July 11, 2014 through July 31, 2014.\xc2\xa0 People often forget some of the extended slumps he went through in the middle of what is considered his premier season. It demonstrates the nature of putting stock in a limited set of statistics.Player 4 is Nick Markakis and his numbers from August 19-30 of 2014. Those look really, really bad. Imagine any player having those stats in spring training \xe2\x80\x93 what would be said of them? There would be great concern. But again, this is a stretch of games in what was considered a very successful season.Of course, the more a player has had consistent success in a long career, the more a poor set of numbers in spring training will not be held against him. When speaking of club expectations, Buck Showalter said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt changes each year and some of the things last year give you a mulligan here and there.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0 More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryAdam Jones has a big mulligan. Delmon Young has not hit very well so far, though he did crush a monster homer on Saturday; but he has a pretty big mulligan as well.But some of those who have not had careers quite so long are going to be needing to get some better results rather soon.For example, David Lough is probably the most vulnerable of the outfielders who were generally expected to make the team. Right now he is 4-for-24 with two walks and five strikeouts. He has also had a sore hamstring. Lough does not want a repeat of the spring and first half of 2014.If Chris Parmelee would like to take that last outfield position, he needs to hit better than 4-for-22. However, he does have six walks and an OBP of .357!Ryan Flaherty is batting a mere 5-for-26 with a homer. His defensive ability and flexibility is still a great asset, but he has more competition than in the past. \xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoOf the pitchers, we have already spoken a good bit about the problem of Ubaldo Jimenez. Honestly, Bud Norris has been hit even harder. Norris right now has an 11.74 ERA and batting average against of 3.84, and he even has three losses on his record. Maybe he is just a poor spring training pitcher? Not really. Norris had very good statistics both last year for the Orioles and in 2013 for the Astros.It is impossible to ever really have even a 25-man roster where almost everyone is performing at the same time near their historic highs. When a team does put that together with a strong majority of players, you can end up with a pitching staff like the Orioles had for the final two-thirds of last year, or what the Red Sox backed into in 2013.

Often times as we reach the midpoint guys start to get restless and they almost hit a brick wall in a sense. But the pitching is starting to resemble that of last year, and the bats are starting to heat up.We\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing more and more \xe2\x80\x9cregulars\xe2\x80\x9d coming on road trips; Adam Jones, Steve Pearce, and Manny Machado (among others) made the trip yesterday. That\xe2\x80\x99s another sign that the season is starting to get within reach. But in looking at the pitching yesterday, if the Birds can keep teams to three runs or less consistently this year, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be a force.Unfortunately the day started on a damp note with the announcement that catcher Matt Wieters would probably start the season on the DL. Wieters of course had been shut down last week due to tendonitis in his surgically-repaired elbow. Buck Showalter was quick to say that this is almost a precaution, and that Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 anticipated return date was April 11th. X-rays came back negative on his elbow, which means that this should be cured with rest.So that means that barring something strange happening, Caleb Joseph will most likely be the starting catcher out of the gate. Thus the battle for back-up catcher is probably going to be one of the most interesting position battles for the remainder of camp. The Orioles have three options: Steve Clevenger, JP Arencibia, and Ryan Lavarnway. If it were up to me I\xe2\x80\x99d go with Clevenger; but it\xe2\x80\x99s not my decision.As if the Wieters thing wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough, the Orioles also got a scare when pitching prospect Hunter Harvey took a comebacker off his ankle in a minor league game against Minnesota. Luckily x-rays were negative and Harvey is going to be fine. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will return to Sarasota this afternoon to take on St. Louis at Ed Smith Stadium. Bud Norris will get the start today for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by old foe John Lackey.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Be Birds Watcher's next superstar writer!  "", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Hunter Harvey suffers right fibula fracture, Orioles ...', "" Orioles fans who were imagining Hunter Harvey pitching in Camden Yards later on this year should probably pump the brakes. That would have been a good idea regardless, as Harvey was still in high school this time two years ago. Now it's even more of a good idea because Harvey\xc2\xa0has suffered a small fracture in his right fibula after being hit by a comebacker in a game yesterday.    There was hope that Harvey, the #20 prospect in baseball according to Baseball Prospectus, escaped injury after X-rays taken yesterday were negative. However, he had a CT scan this morning and that scan revealed the fracture. Harvey will be on crutches for the next month and is expected to have a 4-6 week recovery time in total from the injury. He'll then have to be eased back into shape since he'll be deprived of the last couple of weeks of spring training. Will this end up having much of an effect on Harvey's development? If he comes back from the injury smoothly and the Orioles are able to manage it well, maybe not. They were already planning to limit his innings this season. Harvey missed time at the end of last season and only threw 87.2 innings in total.    So if Harvey misses the first month of the regular season, that could end up just meaning the Orioles don't need to spread those innings over as much time. There's your possible silver lining.

So let\xe2\x80\x99s take a day off from deeper analyses and just go with a list of miscellaneous musings on varied topics.Adam Jones has a Big DayJust yesterday in this column we wrote about the fickle nature of spring training statistics, noting that Jones has not had particularly great statistics so far in Florida. After his first 11 games, he only had one home run and three RBIs while batting .226.\xc2\xa0 On Sunday Jones connected for a pair of home runs and four RBIs against the Cardinals. He suddenly looks a lot better for some reason.Hunter Harvey FractureEven after an X-ray did not reveal a problem, a CT scan did reveal a fracture suffered from a comebacker. This will be a four to six week recovery. Though Buck\xe2\x80\x99s remarks on the situation could be fairly construed as excessive optimism, he does make an accurate point. The Orioles were going to limit Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s innings in the hope that he could be potentially available for any need late in the season. This way they will not have to pull him prematurely to control the innings tally.

No wonder the ball broke something when it hit him. If he was built like CC Sabathia it would have bounced off him like hitting a rubber mat. Speaking of the big guy, he gave up three home runs in a game yesterday for the Yankees. I know you\xe2\x80\x99re grieved.The Worst Record in Spring TrainingIs it the Orioles? Not any more, as the Orioles picked up a number of wins over the past week to go to 8-13. In Florida however, only the Detroit Tigers have a worse record of the 15 teams. The other half of MLB is playing in Arizona, where the worst record (by far) is possessed by \xe2\x80\xa6 wait for it \xe2\x80\xa6 wait for it \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\xa6 the defending world champion San Francisco Giants at 5-16.Bud Norris Continues to StruggleAgain, this all could (and likely will) turn around in an instant before long, but Norris is not having the spring training he would like to see. When only 41 of 71 pitches are strikes, that is a problem. However, he did put down the final six batters he faced, which evidences ability to make adjustments. It is just so difficult to expect that he can have a season like 2014 again (15-8, 3.65), even in a final year before free agency.Who is this Chaz Roe Guy?Every year at spring training we see a handful of players with little to no future with the Orioles who get on the field a good bit early in camp. Roe has appeared in six games so far, the most for any O\xe2\x80\x99s pitcher along with Wesley Wright and Logan Verrett. He has given up 15 hits in 9.2 innings and has a 6.52 ERA.It probably goes without saying that he was a first round draft pick. Why else would he be with the Orioles? It was in 2005 by the Rockies. He has only pitched a total of 24.1 innings in the majors, most recently with the Yankees just last year. His career ERA in the minor leagues is 4.38, so, this does not look encouraging.Something has to Break LooseThe Orioles simply have too many players, particularly in the relief pitching area. There is no way to keep everyone they might like to. So it would seem that some sort of trade has to be forthcoming.Next: Spring Training Disappointments ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Sports Rehab: Steve Melewski Talks Orioles \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' Steve Melewski of MASN Sports joined Sports Rehab to talk Orioles baseball as Opening Day is 2 weeks away.

Chaz Roe would then proceed to allow three runs in relief \xe2\x80\x93 two of which came off of a two-run homer.So it goes as a loss for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and it breaks a four-game winning streak. However for those fans who care about wins and losses in the spring, you can take solace in the fact that the Orioles had the lead when the regulars started syphoning out of the game.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsBefore actually answering the question as to who will carry the Baltimore Orioles in 2015, it is appropriate to ask a more fundamental question: Does any one player carry a major league baseball team?To the second question, I think the answer is \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d though it could be stated that an outstanding season by an individual player will indeed help an otherwise well-rounded team to have a high level of success. The key is to have a handful of players producing seasons near the top of their career stats, while also having the remainder of the roster performing adequately in their roles.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoAn inverse question may actually be truer: Can any one player be the cause of collapse for a major league baseball team? I would submit that, again, it is not as simple as that. However, given the role assignment of a \xe2\x80\x9ccloser\xe2\x80\x9d out of the bullpen, I believe there is more truth that one player can drop a team out of a playoff role than carry a team into the postseason. An example of this is the 2013 Baltimore Orioles with Jim Johnson. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to rehearse that even as much as you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have to read it!Stimulating these thoughts is a recent comment on the blog about a reader\xe2\x80\x99s worry regarding the need to replace Nelson Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s offense. This is a common sentiment expressed by many. In that article, while talking about not placing too much stock in short-term statistics (such as spring training), I illustrated this by picking out a section of Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 season \xe2\x80\x93 a 16-game stretch in July where he hit .103 with one home run with one RBI. What I did not even notice until going back later is that the Orioles were 10-6 over those games.So again, the notion that Nelson Cruz carried the 2014 Orioles is overblown. Consider the following chart that tracks him month by month \xe2\x80\xa6SplitGABRH2BHRRBIBBSOBAApril2388182557251222.284May301152139813271127.339June28107\xc2\xa0 9231514\xc2\xa0 923.215July259513204491019.211Aug2710213226614\xc2\xa0 727.216Sept2610613378\xc2\xa0519\xc2\xa0 622.349Total15861387166324010855140.271\xc2\xa0For the summer months of June, July, and August, Cruz had a batting average of .214; but in April, May, and September combined it was .327.\xc2\xa0 The team record for the Baltimore Orioles in the three summer months when Cruz was NOT hitting well was 52-29, and in the first two months and in September when Cruz WAS allegedly \xe2\x80\x9ccarrying the Orioles,\xe2\x80\x9d the team record was a total of 44-37.

In the one-half of the season when the Orioles were winning on a pace for 104 victories, Nelson Cruz hit .214 with 15 home runs and 37 RBIs. However, what would have happened to the Orioles in the 81 other games before and after the three summer months if Cruz did not hit .335 with 25 home runs and 71 RBIs in them? They certainly would not have been 44-37.So, did Nelson Cruz carry the Orioles? Not when they were winning most of their games; but he did sufficiently carry them through some down times to avert a total disaster. In April and May he prevented them from getting buried too deeply in a hole they could never get out of, positioning the O\xe2\x80\x99s to have the three great summer months that helped them pull away from the AL East.So what about 2015?It will go a long way if Chris Davis can have a bounce-back year. But then again, a player cannot have a much better season than he did in 2013, and it did not \xe2\x80\x9ccarry\xe2\x80\x9d the Birds beyond 85 wins and watching the playoffs rather than participating.It will also help a great deal if the Orioles can get a good bit more offensive production from the catcher and second base positions, whoever or whatever combination ends up at each. And a full season from Manny Machado will go a long way as well.I feel quite confident in the bullpen, especially Zach Britton, to put up another very fine season. Yes, I would have spent the money to retain Andrew Miller, even though there is the hesitation to do so for relievers who, categorically speaking, are alleged to be wildly inconsistent year to year.The Orioles were 16-7 in the games in which Miller appeared for them. Of course, that number is skewed by the fact that his role is to come into games and preserve leads. So he is going to always appear more often in wins than losses. Before Miller joined the Orioles, the O\xe2\x80\x99s were 60-47, whereas their record after that was 36-19. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I would have paid him over the other two that got away.But here is the key to this coming season and to carrying the team. It is no secret to anyone or any baseball observer. How well will the starting rotation perform as compared to 2014? When the starters settled down from June through the end of the season, the entire team fell into place. This is the bigger issue than stressing over how the offensive production of Nick Markakis and Nelson Cruz will be replaced. A great rotation cannot win any sort of championship if a team has a horrible offense, which may be the challenge facing the Rays, for example. But there is no offensive replacement that covers for an inconsistent rotation and bullpen.Next: Spring surprises for the Orioles ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

Those who watch Orioles games closely will remember that he would beat out ground balls and turn even easy outs into surprisingly close calls.This sort of speed is back.

The presumed-to-be most vulnerable outfielder to not break camp with the Orioles in David Lough. The former KC Royals player had the rough start last year with the concussion-like symptoms. Lough is almost certainly the most physically-fit specimen on the Baltimore Orioles. However, he is day-to-day with an injury. Probably most of you have heard how it happened \xe2\x80\x93 bending over to pick up a baseball.Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the same back spasms thing happen about three times in my life. And like Lough, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t doing anything at all abnormal or strenuous. Suddenly I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand up straight. Usually this sort of freak thing happens to Nolan Reimold out of a group of 30 or 40 baseball players.

He probably deserves it more based upon spring numbers than, say, Alejandro De Aza \xe2\x80\x93 who is 5-for-31 (.161) and not looking very good at all.But De Aza has a big contract \xe2\x80\xa6 as does Travis Snider \xe2\x80\xa6 as does Delmon Young. The Orioles hate to lose anyone on a waiver claim, and since Reimold has a minor league contract it will be easier to keep Lough, Paredes, and others at the beginning of the season. Reimold can be sent to AAA and called up later as the situation demands.I really like all of these Orioles outfielders (unlike some of the collection of utility infielders hanging around). But I\xe2\x80\x99ve also always had a heart for Reimold and would love to see him achieve his potential. It would be a shame for him to get this close and get stuck in Norfolk.

With Cruz now in Seattle with the Mariners, which Oriole will step up and hit at least 30 bombs over the fence in 2015?The front runner choice for that question is the face of the franchise: Adam Jones. Last season, Jones missed the 30 home run-mark by one with 29 round trippers. Before that, he hit at least 30 homers in the two previous seasons\xe2\x80\x9333 in 2013 and 32 in 2012.Jones is a fan of hitting in Camden Yards with 87 career home runs in the Yard. With his smooth power stroke, expect Jones to reach the 30 home run mark as he will take it upon himself to make up for the power lost by Cruz. Jones will not be alone with this quest.He will have the help of players like Chris Davis and J.J. Hardy. Davis is another easy guess for who could hit 30 home runs for the Orioles in 2015. Despite a bad year in 2014, he still managed to hit 26 home runs. In 2013, he had a career year with a league-leading and franchise record in home runs with 53.He also hit 33 of them in 2012 with the \xe2\x80\x9cBuckle Up Birds.\xe2\x80\x9d Davis is no stranger to the long ball and, if he can stay healthy and in the lineup, then expect Davis to put at least 30 baseballs over the fence in 2015.Hardy is an interesting pick. He did hit 30 home runs during his first year with the Orioles in 2011. Although he had a tough time finding that power stroke for the first few months of the 2014 season, Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s power is still intact. He had back-to-back-to-back seasons from 2011-2013 with at least 22 home runs.While he will have to find his power swing and timing early on in the season for him to have a shot at 30 home runs in 2015, it is certainly not an unattainable goal.What do you think?

The Orioles defeated the Twins 12-8. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 opening day roster is slowly taking shape, and the spring training competitions are starting to work themselves out. However, with just under two weeks left there are a few tough decisions left to be made, and the most complicated of those could be what to do with the two Rule-5 pitchers currently in spring training.Keeping a Rule-5 player is always complicated, and the Orioles have further complicated that discussion by bringing in two Rule-5 players. The Orioles drafted RHP Logan Verrett from the Mets, and then acquired RHP Jason Garcia in a trade after he was taken by the Astros.For those who may not know, Rule-5 players must stay on the 25-man roster for the entire season, or they must be offered back to their original team. In all certainty, if either player were offered back to their original team they would be welcomed back with open arms. That leaves the Orioles in the awkward position of wanting to keep both players, but wondering how would they fit on the roster and what would be their role.Both players have been as advertised this spring. Verrett is the more polished of the two having played in AAA last season, and he has had a solid spring training. Garcia on the other hand is the more raw of the two having only pitched as high as Single-A last season, however his stuff is impressive, and an arm like that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come along every day.The issue with keeping either pitcher, and the issue with most Rule-5 players, is that at this point in their career they\xe2\x80\x99re probably not ready to play at the Major-League level, and keeping them on the roster would probably mean they will be designated to a low-pressure, insignificant role, at least to start the season.This presents a unique challenge for any team, but especially a team with an already crowded and talented bullpen like the Orioles. Another significant factor will be Ubaldo Jimenez. With the money the Orioles have invested in his contract, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost guaranteed Jimenez will be on the roster for the significant future. However, his performance has hardly justified the roster spot.There\xe2\x80\x99s still a chance Jimenez could make the rotation out of spring training. Although he has done nothing in his year with the Orioles to justify pushing Miguel Gonzalez or Kevin Gausman out of the rotation, there is some train-of-thought that management would be more comfortable with him there than in the bullpen. If he does make the rotation by April there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance he will play himself out of that role sooner rather than later.If, or when, Jimenez loses his spot in the rotation, he most likely will be sent into a similar role as last season when he was mainly used for mop-up duty during blowouts. The problem the Orioles face in that scenario is that role could be occupied by one of the Rule-5 players.There is a chance the Orioles could make a trade to keep either, or both, Rule-5 players, in which case they could be optioned to AAA. However, if a deal cannot be made, bullpen spots are extremely limited among the talented arms in the organization. In this scenario, the Orioles may have to choose between losing a talented young arm or throwing away a lot of money by releasing Jimenez. Next: Baltimore Orioles: Is there a Toronto problem Brewing?

The name Chuck Thompson is one that invokes a lot of memories to any Baltimore Orioles fan. Even those who never heard Mr. Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s mastery behind the mic firsthand know what he is and what he meant to Orioles fans and the people of Baltimore. When you think of the great voices of the game, the names Vin Scully, Mel Allen, Red Barber, and others come to mind. However I would submit that the name Chuck Thompson should be right up there as well.When the Orioles came to Baltimore in 1954, future Detroit legend Ernie Harwell was the lead radio voice. However Thompson was part of the coverage of Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s new big league club, until he departed for Washington DC to call Washington Senators games alongside the legendary Bob Wolff in 1957. In 1962 Thompson returned to Baltimore, and was the voice of the Orioles until 1987 when he retired for the first time. However Thompson came out of retirement and called games part-time for the team until 2000 when he was forced into retirement permanently due to muscular degeneration in his eyes.\xc2\xa0More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

He called arguably the greatest game ever played, the 1958 NFL Championship Game between the Colts and the NY Giants, as well as the 1960 World Series in which Bill Mazeroski hit a walk off home run in game seven to defeat the NY Yankees. When back in Baltimore, Thompson would often rotate between calling games in radio and TV, however I would submit that he was at his best while calling Orioles games in the radio booth.Of course, all Orioles fans know his trademarks:\xc2\xa0ain\xe2\x80\x99t the beer cold, and\xc2\xa0go to war, Ms Agnes!\xc2\xa0As much as anything else, these lines were synonymous with Thompson, as well as with various generations of Baltimore sports fans. Heck, 15 years after Thompson called his final game, I\xe2\x80\x99m still titling this column\xc2\xa0the beer\xe2\x80\x99s still cold! But as much as those lines were representative of Thompson, he himself was representative of all of the great Orioles that fans remember growing up. Thompson was their ticket to see the likes of Brooks Robinson, Jim Palmer, Frank Robinson, Eddie Murray, and Cal Ripken Jr. play without actually being in the park. His smooth delivery and crisp voice was one of the many marks of summertime in the mid-Atlantic region.When I was a kid in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s, my father wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay the extra money to upgrade our cable package to include Home Team Sports (which carried most Orioles games) simply out of principle. A few games a week would be carried over-the-air, but other than that I\xe2\x80\x99d follow the team through the radio. In that sense, perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit of a throwback to previous generations \xe2\x80\x93 when radio was truly the only way to follow games. However while Thompson was in his later years as a broadcaster, I immediately recognized his talent and his tie to the Orioles (with the help of lessons from my father and uncles).So yes, Chuck Thompson still serves as a link to the past for Orioles fans who remember him. When they see old videos of the team, his voice is always there. I was a bit dismayed last year during the formal 50th anniversary celebration when there was no mention made of him. However his voice was omnipresent throughout the film footage that was shown.Nevertheless, Thompson (who won the Ford C. Frick award in 1993 at the MLB Hall of Fame) is the only Oriole Hall of Famer that\xe2\x80\x99s not recognized in some manner at Camden Yards. I said this when I wrote my tribute to Thompson last year, however I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it again. Since the on-field hall of famers are memorialized with statues, I would call on the Orioles to dedicate the press box at the yard as the \xe2\x80\x9cChuck Thompson Memorial Press Box.\xe2\x80\x9d Chuck Thompson is as much a part of the franchise\xe2\x80\x99s history as anyone else, and he\xe2\x80\x99s the common link between the generation that watched Frank and Brooks, and those of us who grew up with Eddie and Cal.Regardless of anything else, the great Chuck Thompson wowed Orioles fans with his prowess behind the mic for years. Not every city has such a legendary voice by which to remember their baseball memories. In that manner, Baltimore is blessed given that Thompson spent his summers calling Orioles games and his autumn Sunday afternoons with the Colts.In terms of this season\xe2\x80\x99s beginning, the beer seems to get colder each day we come closer to Opening Day.

What\'s unoptimistic is something that might require surgery or be longer than the time frame that they\'re thinking.""Everth Cabrera and Ryan Flaherty are the primary candidates to replace Hardy while he\'s out.Rays: LHP Drew Smyly, who is out with shoulder tendinitis, will throw batting practice Wednesday and Saturday. After that, he\'ll go on a minor league rehab assignment. ... RHP Alex Cobb (forearm tendinitis) played catch for the second time since he was cleared to resume throwing. ... RHP Matt Moore (Tommy John surgery) and LHP Jake McGee (elbow surgery) are scheduled for bullpens on Tuesday.STARTING TIMEOrioles: The 22 year-old Davies had a good time in his first start against major leaguers. ""There was a little bit of nerves at first, kind of what to expect, but made sure that I didn\'t get too nervous out there and made sure it didn\'t affect me while I was on the mound,"" Davies said.Rays: In Andriese\'s first five starts, he allowed two earned runs on 14 hits in 16 1-3 innings. ""I wished I could have gone four or five or six,"" Andriese said. ""I would have loved to go out there and go six today with no runs. The results weren\'t there.""CUTSOrioles: Reassigned C J.P. Arencibia to minor league camp. The Orioles have 36 in camp.Rays: Reassigned RHPs Brandon Gomes, Jhan Marinez, Jim Miller, LHP Jordan Norberto, C Mayo Acosta and OFs Corey Brown and Joey Butler to minor league camp. Manager Kevin Cash says they will remain with the team for its final spring games.BASEBALL WAITSShowalter said that Pat Connaughton, the Notre Dame basketball star who is also a pitcher in Baltimore\'s minor league system, would not report to the team any time soon.""We\'re not going to pressure him, push him. We want, though, when he decides that it is done, the NBA ain\'t there, then his full attention comes to baseball instead of coming right to us and then wondering.""UP NEXTOrioles: RHP Kevin Gausman, who is still in contention for the fifth spot in the rotation starts against a Tampa Bay split squad on Tuesday. LHP Everett Teaford starts for the second time in four days against the Orioles in Sarasota.Rays: Veteran RHP Jim Miller starts for Tampa Bay against Boston LHP Wade Miley in Port Charlotte.

Some know that they have no chance. Others think they have all the pieces to win a championship.That is exactly what\xc2\xa0fantasy baseball owners think too. This is the year I win it all.You cannot watch any game or visit a sports website that is\xc2\xa0not advertising fantasy sports. Fantasy sports have become such a sensation in recent years that there are multiple websites that allow you to compete in a wide array of leagues. The options available are limitless. You can do a snake or auction draft. Roto scoring\xc2\xa0or head-to-head matchups. Like pitchers? You can make it a pitchers only league. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget about the money that comes along with it.\xc2\xa0It is a phenomenon like no other.\xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryThe Baltimore Orioles are coming off a season in which they advanced all the way to the American League Championship. Household names to us have now become familiar\xc2\xa0names throughout\xc2\xa0the country.\xc2\xa0Despite that success, the Orioles have a relatively small group of players that fantasy experts are expecting to have an impact in fantasy sports. The top player for the Orioles last season, Nelson Cruz, is now in Seattle. He finished as the No. 18 player in ESPN standard leagues. Not bad for a player that was\xc2\xa0ranked No. 147 entering the season.The Orioles have five players that could be\xc2\xa0selected in the top-200 of fantasy baseball drafts. The top-two are logical choices as one is two years removed from leading the league in homers and the other is our perennial All-Star. The shocker is the two options are guys coming off surgery.\xc2\xa0Baltimore fans are not the only ones who are hoping they come back and make an impact, but fantasy owners also.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Note: The projections used below are those of ESPN. I have used their service over the years because I believe it is the best option\xc2\xa0for fantasy sports.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Adam Jones2014 Stats: .281/.311/.469 \xe2\x80\x93 88 R, 29 HR, 96 RBI, 7 SB 2015 Projections: .279/.313/.485 \xe2\x80\x93 93 R, 32 HR, 93 RBI, 10 SB ADP: 17.1The Orioles four-time All-Star leads the way for the Orioles, and is a remarkably consistent player for fantasy owners. The only criticism\xc2\xa0on Jones is that his aggressiveness leads to a lot of strike outs and few walks, but you cannot argue with his overall impact on your team.\xc2\xa0His ability to contribute in every statistical category as well as provide anywhere between 7-10 steals make him arguably a top-10 player. The general public doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with that, as he can still be scooped up in the later part of the second round. Don\xe2\x80\x99t reach for your favorite Oriole, but take advantage of\xc2\xa0being a fan if he\xe2\x80\x99s still available anywhere after the first round.\xc2\xa0Chris Davis2014 Stats: .196/.300/.404 \xe2\x80\x93 65 R, 26 HR, 72 RBI, 2 SB 2015 Projections: .241/.332/.495 \xe2\x80\x93 75 R, 33 HR, 87 RBI, 3 SB ADP: 74.5What can we expect from Crush in 2015? Is he player that hit 53 homers and 138 RBI in\xc2\xa02013 or the guy that batted .196 and struggled mightily throughout the season, which ultimately ended with a 25-game suspension for PED use. The answer is probably neither. The Orioles are hoping that he returns to the numbers similar to his 2012 season. I think he\xe2\x80\x99s capable of a 35 home run and 100 RBI season.\xc2\xa0Davis\xe2\x80\x99 value is lower than expected because he is eligible to play both first and third base in fantasy. If Buck Showalter is serious about playing him in the outfield also, that only increases his value.Manny Machado2014 Stats: .278/.324/.431 \xe2\x80\x93 38 R, 12 HR, 32 RBI, 2 SB 2015 Projections: .282/.326/.441 \xe2\x80\x93 76 R, 18 HR, 69 RBI, 6 SB ADP: 100.1It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe that Machado is still just 22 years old and his full potential hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been reached yet. The knock on Manny has been injuries to both his knees, but it is believed that his most recent surgery will fix him for years to come. He was an absolute menace before his injury, sporting an impressive .307/.350/.505 in his last 55 games of the 2014 campaign. It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame that teams don\xe2\x80\x99t get points for defense too cause Machado would be on top. Regardless, Machado could be a steal at 100 because he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly capable of finishing as one of the top-5 third basemen, if\xc2\xa0he stays healthy.Zach Britton2014 Stats: 76.1 IP, 1.65 ERA, 0.90 WHIP \xe2\x80\x93 62 K, 23 BB, 3 W, 37 SV 2015 Projections: 75.0 IP, 2.76 ERA, 1.24 WHIP \xe2\x80\x93 55 K, 29 BB, 4 W, 42 SV ADP: 139.5Last season, the Orioles closer role was lined up for Tommy Hunter, but when he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of the opportunity, Britton ran away the job. The southpaw went on to convert 37 of 41 save opportunities while enjoying the best season of his career. The projections at ERA and WHIP are high for someone who is a ground ball pitcher with a fantastic infield\xc2\xa0behind him. The key is to limit the long balls that became a problem in the playoffs. The Orioles have reached 50-plus saves in each of the past three seasons and Britton should finish somewhere near that, proving that last season was no fluke.Matt Wieters2014 Stats: .308/.339/.500 \xe2\x80\x93 13 R, 5 HR, 18 RBI, 0 SB 2015 Projections: .258/.315/.444 \xe2\x80\x93 55 R, 20 HR, 69 RBI, 2 SB ADP: 204.3Wieters gets the benefit of the doubt because of the lack of options that are reliable at the position.\xc2\xa0It is surprising to see Wieters name listed as a potential top-200 player in fantasy baseball coming off Tommy John surgery. He will start the season on the DL on most likely will return as a DH before we see him catching anytime soon. Fantasy owners are hoping that, once healthy, he can return\xc2\xa0on last year\xe2\x80\x99s impressive numbers in limited action. The switch-hitter batted .308/.339/.500 with an elbow that was damaged. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a large sample of catchers who have returned from Tommy John surgery so it remains to be seen if he\xe2\x80\x99ll come anywhere close to the player he once was.\xc2\xa0Wieters still gets the benefit of the doubt because of the lack of options that are available\xc2\xa0at the catcher position and could be a bargain late.Next: Predicting the Orioles Opening Day RosterMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), (""Taking a Stab at the Baltimore Orioles' Opening Day Roster"", 'Mar 7, 2015; Sarasota, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles left fielder Alejandro De Aza (12) is congratulated by first baseman Steve Pearce (28) after he scored a run during the first inning against the Boston Red Sox at a spring training baseball game at Ed Smith Stadium.

Lough has been bothered by hamstring problems. Hardy has a shoulder muscle strain, and the hope is that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be back sometime in April.

Hardy for a muscle strain in his shoulder, and Matt Wieters of course for his surgically-repaired elbow. The question at hand is whether or not these issues will leave the Baltimore Orioles hamstrung for the beginning of the season. (No pun intended.) And the answer to that is that it very well could \xe2\x80\x93 if the Birds allow it to.Injuries are never a good thing, and the fact that so many have seem to come at the end of the spring is frustrating. But the only way this becomes a problem for the Birds is if they don\xe2\x80\x99t adopt their mantra of the past right out of the gate: next man up. This is a group that lost Nick Markakis to a broken wrist in September of 2012, only to rally and still make the playoffs. Then last year of course they lost Wieters and Manny Machado, only to win the division and make it to the ALCS.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

However keep in mind that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a wave of injuries around MLBCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportsthis spring training. Just look down the road a bit and ask the Washington Nationals. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be without Jayson Werth, Denard Span, Anthony Rendon, and possibly some others come next week. Ask the Texas Rangers, who sent Yu Darvish off to get Tommy John surgery during spring training. So in that sense the Orioles are lucky \xe2\x80\x93 all three injured Birds are expected to head to the 15-day DL.Of the three, I would submit that Hardy is the most serious in terms of effecting the team. Lough might actually end up being out the longest, however also keep in mind that Lough was a role player who didn\xe2\x80\x99t start too often last season. Wieters is expected to be off the DL on April 11th, which is the first Saturday of the season. (So if he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to go at that time, he\xe2\x80\x99d miss all of four games.) And Hardy is expected to return sometime in April, so we probably aren\xe2\x80\x99t talking about injuries that will hurt the team too much.But it\xe2\x80\x99s for reasons like this that Dan Duquette signed guys like Evereth Cabrera (a former all-star) and Jayson Nix. It also presumably allows both Ryan Flaherty and Jimmy Paredes to break camp with the team. The key word there is\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0presumably \xe2\x80\x93 nothing\xe2\x80\x99s set in stone of course. I would also remind fans that Hardy missed four or five games due to some nagging back injuries during the first two weeks of last season.

With just five days until Opening Day, the Orioles are making their final preparations for what they hope to be another successful season. While the major league roster is loaded with talent, the Orioles still have plenty of talent being molded and perfected in their minor league system.Dylan Bundy, Christian Walker and Hunter Harvey are the team\xe2\x80\x99s best prospects. However, there are some others that Oriole fans may see dawn the orange and black at some point this season.Zach Davies is the team\xe2\x80\x99s No. 4 overall prospect. Drafted by the Orioles in the 26th round of the 2011 MLB Draft, the right-handed pitcher has played the previous three seasons in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s farm system.Davies has put together back-to-back solid seasons on the mound. In 2014, he appeared in 21 games (20 starts) and posted a 3.35 ERA in 110.0 innings 109 with 109 strikeouts to his credit in Double-A Bowie. He mixes his three pitches very well to keep batters guessing. While his curveball and fastball are average, his changeup is his best pitch and is one of the best in the minor leagues.\xc2\xa0More from Minors12/21 - Baltimore Orioles: Prospect Hunter Harvey to could resume throwing next week4/26 - Baltimore Orioles: Ryan Flaherty to Norfolk4/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Minor League Estate2/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Dylan Bundy has his Career in the Balance2/3 - Baltimore Orioles: First basemen on the move?Davies is a groundball pitcher and uses his sinking fastball to induce such groundballs. Although he is not an ace by any means, he has the potential to become a No. 4 or 5 starter with enough work.

He pitched 4 1/3 innings allowing just one run and striking out five in the Grapefruit League.Tim Berry is another pitcher who is expected to make his major league debut this season.

During spring training this year, Berry appeared in four Grapefruit League games, pitching five complete innings and giving up four runs off seven hits.The southpaw may be better suited for the bullpen when he makes it to Camden Yards. In 2013, Berry pitched effectively coming out of the \xe2\x80\x98pen in the Arizona Fall League. It was apparent in those games that his pitches, especially his fastball, were crisper and more consistent.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Too many injuries \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Why Chris Tillman is Opening Day Starter', 'Sep 20, 2014; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Chris Tillman (30) pitches in the first inning against the Boston Red Sox at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThere really was not a lot of suspense as to who would be the opening day pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles. It was finally announced on Tuesday that it would indeed be Chris Tillman, who will be making the start on day one for the second consecutive season.The debate goes on among Orioles fans as to if Chris Tillman qualifies as an \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cace\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d or a true #1 top-of-the-rotation pitcher. Much of this centers around what is meant by the definition of an \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cace.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0He is admittedly not the best starter in the American League, but he certainly belongs at least in the category of the top 10 to 15. And if you take out his worst couple of games, he would statistically rank even closer to the top.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoBut there can be no debate that he is the Orioles\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99 ace, even with his record of 13-6 last year. Let me flesh that out just a bit. His nearest comparison from 2014 would be Wei-Yin Chen at 16-6. And along the way, Bud Norris actually had two more victories (15-8), while Miguel Gonzalez (10-9) had the best ERA of starters at 3.23.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 But there is more to be said than simple won-loss records, and even greater details to be understood beyond simple ERA.To begin with, Tillman threw a total of 207 innings, 22 more than Chen and 42 more than Norris. He did have a couple more starts, but it is true that Tillman consistently got the Orioles deep into games.A statistic that measures the consistent performance of starters is that of the quality start. Tillman pitched six innings with three or fewer runs in 21 of his 34 starts for a 62% rate. Actually, Gonzalez also did so at 62%, though the third best was Chen at only 48%.More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryTillman held opposing hitters to the lowest batting average against of the starters, registering .238. Norris was close at .242, whereas both Gonzalez (.255) and Chen (.266) were above the league average of .252.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Interestingly, Ubaldo Jimenez had hitters only bat .241 against him. As we know, this is not the problem!Here is a truly amazing statistic. Though Tillman yielded 129 singles, 66 walks and 4 HBP for a total of 199 baserunners at first base, only four attempted to steal against him, and only one was successful. That is simply unheard of!But the bottom line is about wins and losses. And though various starting pitchers have different ways of being effective relative to WHIP or HR/9 innings, etc., it comes down to limiting damage and giving your team a chance to win. Tillman certainly did this, as the Orioles were 24-10 in his starts. The next best numbers were 19-9 by Norris and 19-12 by Chen.So how did Chen have the better 16-6 record? There is a statistical category called \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9ccheap win\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 referring to victories in games where the starter did not deliver a quality start. So these would be games where the most frequent scenario is having the offense bail out the pitcher. Chen had eight such \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9ccheap wins\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d and Norris had seven. Tillman only had three.Tillman also had the most games where he departed the game with the team in the lead, only to have the other team come back and win off relief pitchers. This happened five times.An area where Tillman could improve his game would be to walk fewer batters than the 2.9 per nine innings pitched. This is the result of throwing and living on the edge of the plate. But cutting the walks would not only make for a smaller number of base runners, it would also cut down on pitch counts and allow him to go just a bit deeper into games.So Tillman surely deserves the start, and I think we can anticipate another very solid and consistent season from what is still a rather young pitcher.Next: Covering the losses of Lough and Hardy\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('The Orioles right field platoon against the rest of the AL ...', ' It\'s pretty clear that Toronto has the best right fielder in the division heading into 2015. However, everything else gets a lot murkier after that. Boston and Tampa have a pair of talented youngsters who are tough to judge at this point. Meanwhile, New York has one of the oldest players in baseball playing right for them. And who the heck even is the starter for the Orioles?    We continue on in our series covering the positions across the American League East. We have now covered all of the hitters. Check back later in the week for our assessment of the division\'s pitching staffs. The list below is my ranking, from worst to best, of the starting right fielders of each team in the AL East. Yes, I\'m probably wrong. So, please tell me about it in the comments and vote in the poll following the piece. TAMPA BAY RAYS Steve Souza Jr.Age: 25 years old (5/24/1989)ML Experience: 21 gamesSalary: $507,500 in 2015 (league minimum)       Season G PA BA/OBP/SLG SB-CS 2B HR RBI WAR UZR   2014 21 26 .130/.231/.391 0-0 0 2 2 0.0 0.6   2015 ZiPS 110 428 .228/.304/.396 16-7 17 15 46 1.4 --        He\'s here because of his inexperience; only 21 games so far and they were not pretty with the Nationals last year. Souza was Washington\'s 10th best prospect in 2013,\xc2\xa0according to Baseball America, before an off-season trade brought him to Tampa. The right-handed hitter slashed .260/.354/.440, hit 93 home runs and stole over 150 bases over his eight years in the minors and was named International League MVP in 2014, overcoming a 50-game suspension for using a banned substance back in 2010    A 2014 scouting report from BA refers to him as ""a solid-average defender out there with a plus arm"", but doesn\'t expect his base stealing to translate to the MLB as he possesses only ""average speed."" Part of the reason he never got a chance in Washington is because the corner outfield spots are covered with Jayson Werth and Bryce Harper. That won\'t be an issue in Tampa where the Rays are expected to endure some rough patches. NEW YORK YANKEES  Carlos BeltranAge: 37 years old (4/24/1977)  ML Experience: 16 seasons   Salary: $15,000,000 in 2015       Season G PA BA/OBP/SLG SB-CS 2B HR RBI WAR UZR   2014 109 449 .233/.301/.402 3-1 22 15 49 -0.7 -3.9   2015 ZiPS 113 464 .254/.310/.434 2-1 23 17 62 -0.4 --        He\'s here because of his experience. The guy is gonna be 38 in a few weeks, yet the Yankee\'s website still has him as the starting right fielder come Opening Day. I realize we already examined him as the Bomber\'s DH a few days ago, but I\'m just not sure who else they are going to throw out into right field. I have no clue who that was in Chris Young\'s body after he arrived in August but don\'t expect him to repeat his .282/.354/.521 line again. And Garret Jones has a nice bat, but he may find himself between first and DH as well. It has to be Beltran in right. The switch-hitter is coming off a surgery to remove bone spurs in his right elbow, and still has two years and $30 million left on his contract. \xc2\xa0He was an All-Star in 2013, but it seems like a distant memory now. BALTIMORE ORIOLES Travis SniderAge: 27 years old (2/2/1988)ML Experience: 4 seasonsSalary: $2,100,000 in 2015    Season G PA BA/OBP/SLG SB-CS 2B HR RBI WAR UZR   2014 140 359 .264/.338/.438 1-1 15 13 38 1.5 -6.7   2015 ZiPS 131 395 .242/.310/.410 5-3 16 14 47 0.6 --        Steve PearceAge: 31 years old (4/13/1983)ML Experience: 5 seasonsSalary: $3,700,000 in 2015    Season G PA BA/OBP/SLG SB-CS 2B HR RBI WAR UZR   2014 102 383 .293/.373/.556 5-0 26 21 49 4.9 1.3   2015 ZiPS 84 297 .262/.345/.473 3-1 16 13 40 1.7  --     No more Nick Markakis *sigh*. It\'s anyone\'s guess as to who will actually spend the most time in right field for the Orioles in 2015. The team\'s website has Snider sitting atop the depth chart with Pearce as the DH, but i would surmise to say that they both see some time there; even though Pearce is likely the Opening Day first baseman with Chris Davis serving the final game of his suspension. And even Davis has seen time in right during the spring. Clearly, it\'s pretty confusing. Anyway... I suppose I shouldn\'t be quite as surprised by Pearce\'s ZiPS projection as the man did just break out as a 31-year-old. That\'s not typical, but to have him playing in just 84 games? I\'m not so sure I see that as he is pretty versatile, being able to play first, left and right in addition to DH. Not to mention, he is having a nice spring. Snider doesn\'t resemble the mold of a modern Oriole much. He\'s poor in the field, and he is OK at the plate. Plus, his splits don\'t show any obvious advantage to playing him against lefties or righties. He is likely to be part of a rotation to keep the hot hitter in the lineup.    The pair could be an example of ""the sum is greater than the parts"". Buck likes to mix and match. Snider will play if he is hitting. If not, they will move things around. However, the lack of a clear cut starter and the uncertainty of how good Pearce really is forces me to put them middle of the road in the division. BOSTON RED SOX Rusney Castillo  Age: 27 years old (9/7/1987)  ML Experience: 10 games  Salary: $11,271,000 in 2015    Season G PA BA/OBP/SLG SB-CS 2B HR RBI WAR UZR   2014 10 40 .333/.400/.528 3-0 1 2 6 0.9 2.0   2015 ZiPS 142 583 .269/.326/.386 21-9 24 11 50 2.6 --     OK, I\'m straying away from what the Red Sox depth chart says online here. Sure, Shane Victorino may be the Opening Day right fielder, but it will be the Cuban rookie who gets more time there throughout the season. In his cameo with the big club last year, Castillo was exclusively in center field, but Mookie Betts likely has that locked down now after an impressive showing to end 2014. However, Victorino\'s name has been widely discussed in trade talks this spring, and he doesn\'t have the upside that Castillo offers. The 27-year-old has more raw power than scouts expected him to when he first came out of Cuba. He tips the scales at just over 200 lbs now versus the 185 he was listed at a few years ago. It\'s hard to see Boston sending that type of talent to Pawtucket and preferring a 34-year-old Victorino    Having Castillo ranked second in the division may be seen as ambitious. I realize he is unproven in the MLB, but he has all the skills to be a top-tier player immediately. I would expect his name to be in the discussion of AL Rookie of the Year throughout the season. TORONTO BLUE JAYS Jose BautistaAge: 34 years old (10/19/1980)ML Experience:\xc2\xa09 seasonsSalary: $14,000,000 in 2015    Season G PA BA/OBP/SLG SB-CS 2B HR RBI WAR UZR   2014 155 673 .286/.403/.524 6-2 27 35 103 6.2 4.8   2015 ZiPS 120 524 .267/.384/.515 6-2 21 29 84 4.6 --     Who is the beast of the east is pretty easy in this position battle.\xc2\xa0The former Oriole (for 16 games) earned his fifth straight All-Star selection last year, the third Silver Slugger of his career and came in sixth in the voting for the MVP award. Bautista doesn\'t look like a 34-year-old in the field. He has a rocket for an arm and has the ability to play center field as well as the corner infield positions if he was asked to.    Really, there is not much else to say about him. We know how good he is and it still annoys some of us that he once donned the black and orange. But fret not, as the Royals, Pirates and Rays all gave up on him a bit early as well. ** There you have it. The O\'s are going to lose some fielding ability in right field with the loss of Markakis, but they should gain some pop, depending on who is playing. Outside of Baltimore, Bautista once again reigns supreme while Castillo could be an exciting player to watch. I just wish he wasn\'t wearing a Red Sox uniform. Now it\'s time for us to hear from you. Where do the Orioles rank in your mind? Who is the best right fielder in the division? Comment and vote down below.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
04/02/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: A few 2015 predictions - Birds Watcher', 'Photo: Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY SportsThis is the time where fans, experts and all others following the game get to express their predictions about the upcoming season. These predictions normally only result in debate, anger and sometimes justification among other baseball fans, and really don\xe2\x80\x99t have much purpose otherwise. In fact, its relatively silly given that the sport\xe2\x80\x99s unpredictability is its greatest quality. However, I do have an outlet here to document my predictions, so on the off chance that I\xe2\x80\x99m right, here are a few\xe2\x80\xa6Chris Davis will have a bounce back year (which is good and bad for the Orioles).After his career year in 2013, Chris Davis had a well-discussed flop in 2014. Some of last year could be attributed to his nagging rib injury, or his lack of Adderall, or his pressure to live up to the high expectations he set the previous season. \xc2\xa0Whatever the reasons, Davis will be able to put last season behind him and put up numbers similar the 2013 Chris Davis. Fortunately for the Orioles, this will fill the much needed offensive void left by the departure of Nelson Cruz. Unfortunately for the Orioles, a strong 2015 for Davis, who is a free agent at the end of the season, will most likely make him too expensive once he hits the open market after the season.Matt Wieters won\xe2\x80\x99t have a bounce-back season (which is also good and bad for the Orioles).Coming back from Tommy John surgery, Matt Wieters will begin the season on the D.L., and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell at this point when exactly the Orioles are aiming for their catcher to return. Wieters will at some point this season be the regular catcher again, but it may take even more time after that for him to become the Wieters Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans have seen in the past. Although the Orioles may miss his bat for much of the season in 2015, his less-than-par numbers will make him more likely to sign an extension with Orioles rather than take his chances on the open market after the season.Manny Machado will be in the MVP discussion.Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans have watched in horror twice in the last two seasons as their promising young third baseman has been carried off the field with frightening knee injuries. Although he is only twenty-two, knee problems have been a nagging injury that have derailed many promising careers. For that reason, Manny Machado will carry the \xe2\x80\x9cif he stays healthy\xe2\x80\x9d tag around for most of the foreseeable future. However, in spring training he has looked bigger, stronger and healthier than he has since putting on an Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 uniform. He has shown he can be the best defensive player in baseball, and he has shown he can be a productive offensive player. This season he will add a spike in power numbers that will solidify himself among the elite players in baseball.The Orioles will have a slightly different offensive philosophy.Earl Weaver famously set up the \xe2\x80\x9cOrioles\xe2\x80\x99 Way\xe2\x80\x9d offensive blueprint of getting on base and hitting homeruns, and that philosophy has continued under Buck Showalter. Essentially, the last few seasons, the Orioles haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken chances on the base-paths and have waited for the big homerun, and with the lineup the Orioles currently have there is no reason to think they won\xe2\x80\x99t follow a similar philosophy in 2015. However, this season the Orioles have more running threats in Alejandro De Aza and Everth Cabrera than in previous seasons. Also, Jonathan Schoop and Manny Machado have been vocal about wanting to steal more bases. Last season, the Orioles stole 44 bases, which was by far the lowest in baseball. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look for the 2015 Orioles to run like the 2014 Royals, but expect that they will run significantly more than in recent memory.\xc2\xa0 Next: Baltimore Orioles: Final spring night on Tillman island\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles return all starting pitchers, but some division ...', ' Orioles starting pitchers had the fourth-best ERA in the American League last year. I know, it still surprises me every time I see it. They needed only seven pitchers to start 162 games, and one of these pitchers, T.J. McFarland, started only a single game. So really, the Orioles needed to use only six pitchers to cover 161 starts. That kind of continuity even within a single season is not common in baseball these days.    Over the course of a season, teams must battle injuries and ineffectiveness. Things went about as well as they could for the Orioles last year. For most their division rivals, this was not the case. The Yankees had 13 different starting pitchers, with nine different pitchers starting at least 12 games each. The Red Sox used 11 starters, with nine of them starting at least 10 games. The Rays also needed 11 pitchers, though six of them started a combined 141 games. The O\'s most fortunate division rival was the Blue Jays, who needed to use nine different starters, with five of these starting a combined 144 games. If the Jays bullpen hadn\'t have been one of the worst in all of baseball, we might have been talking about that team more. One of their five frequent starters from last year, Marcus Stroman, is already out for the season due to a torn UCL he suffered doing a bunt drill in spring training. It\'s all well and good to look at a team\'s Opening Day rotation to figure out how well they should do. The reality is that for most teams, by season\'s end, their 6th-9th starters are going to play a significant role in how their season turns out. You don\'t know what a team\'s going to get from those guys until they show up. They could end up being top prospects getting their chance, minor league filler desperately pressed into service, or midseason acquisitions plugged into a gap.    Baseball, much like life, is chaotic and unpredictable, but when it comes to trying to guess what\'s going to happen, predictions are all we\'ve got to go on. Talking about nothing is boring. Here\'s how the AL East rotations look as the season is set to begin, with each pitcher\'s 2015 ZiPS projection from Fangraphs:    TORONTO BLUE JAYS    Player GS IP ERA BB SO WHIP   Drew Hutchison 27 151.1 4.22 48 143 1.28   R.A. Dickey 30 194.0 4.04 59 152 1.26   Daniel Norris 28 132.1 4.35 60 143 1.37   Mark Buehrle 30 191.0 4.10 45 110 1.36   Aaron Sanchez 20 127.2 4.44 70 102 1.48    When you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. Nietzsche knew his stuff. At least as far as the ZiPS projection is concerned, you can forget about the Jays as competitors for the division this year.    It\'s not that easy to dismiss them, of course. Norris is rated in the top 20 prospects in baseball by the likes of Baseball America and MLB.com. Sanchez is a top 25 prospect in the eyes of Baseball Prospectus, and in the top 50 of the others. If these prospects come out dealing, as well they could, the Jays will be in a lot better shape than these projections make them look. The same is true if Hutchison ever experiences MLB-level success against a team other than the Orioles. TAMPA BAY RAYS    Player GS IP ERA BB SO WHIP   Chris Archer 30 170.0 3.49 65 150 1.29   Jake Odorizzi 27 147.1 4.22 59 130 1.35   Nate Karns 24 133.0 4.26 59 125 1.38   Erasmo Ramirez 24 140.1 4.55 44 99 1.36   Matt Andriese 24 138.1 4.36 44 93 1.34    For the Rays, the fact that their Opening Day rotation is not going to last throughout the whole season is a positive. The Rays are missing three names who they hope will be back in action soon. Matt Moore looks to return from April 2014 Tommy John surgery, though as Orioles fans know from watching Dylan Bundy, it\'s not so easy as counting on a pitcher being back at 100% when you hit the one year anniversary of the surgery.    Alex Cobb and Drew Smyly, both of whom figure into the Rays rotation picture in the long run, are each recovering from tendinitis. Cobb\'s is in his right forearm, while Smyly\'s is in his left shoulder. There\'s also Alex Colome, who has to recover from a bout of pneumonia. Hopefully they didn\'t first tell him he had a strained oblique from coughing too hard, like what happened with Kevin Gausman last year. If three of those players return to health and set themselves up in the rotation alongside of Archer, the Rays will have a good rotation and that will make them a tough team to contend with. They\'ll have to get by at least most of April with this patchwork unit. NEW YORK YANKEES    Player GS IP ERA BB SO WHIP   Masahiro Tanaka 25 167.0 3.50 33 158 1.12   Michael Pineda 15 80.2 3.68 20 65 1.21   CC Sabathia 18 118.0 4.35 30 106 1.27   Nathan Eovaldi 28 159.2 4.51 48 121 1.37   Adam Warren 0 75.1 3.47 25 72 1.22    At least as far as the ZiPS projections are concerned, the Yankees rotation is another example of why you need to think about who your 6th-8th best starter candidates are. Warren was only announced to make the rotation on Wednesday afternoon and as you can see, the projection didn\'t think he\'d be doing any starting at all. Tanaka had a brilliant rookie campaign in MLB that was cut short by a partially-torn elbow ligament that, for now at least, he has successfully rehabbed. Sabathia threw only 46 innings last year and\xc2\xa0will never have his knees at 100% for the rest of his career. His ERA ballooned from 3.38 in 2012 to 4.78 in 2013. He\'s lost something like 4mph off his fastball. Even if healthy, he\'s not the pitcher he was.    Two Yankees who figure to end up in their rotation are working back from injuries. Chris Capuano suffered a strained quad and could return in May, while Ivan Nova had Tommy John surgery last May and is on the mend. BOSTON RED SOX    Player GS IP ERA BB SO WHIP   Clay Buchholz 25 153.1 4.17 50 118 1.32   Rick Porcello 29 183.2 3.72 42 131 1.24   Wade Miley 30 186.2 3.90 63 155 1.32   Justin Masterson 26 157.2 4.28 71 134 1.40   Steven Wright 19 113.2 5.15 57 72 1.58    Yesterday I had the opportunity to participate in an ESPN-organized conference call with Curt Schilling and John Kruk. A Boston writer asked whether the two felt like the Red Sox had an ace on their staff, prompting Schilling to offer that Buchholz was only going to start on Opening Day because he\'d been there the longest, and that Buchholz is not an ace because he doesn\'t want to be an ace. I don\'t know if that is relevant to Buchholz as a pitcher or not, but it was funny for me to listen to. The Red Sox are currently the favorites to win the AL East according to the Bovada sportsbook. They are 2/1 to win the division. That\'s a bold bet with this rotation outlook. Porcello will probably be good for them. Miley has started at least 29 games in each of the last three seasons. That was for Arizona. Welcome to the AL East, Wade. Joe Kelly will be back soon and probably displace Wright, the knuckleballer, from the rotation. ZiPS projects a 4.21 ERA from Kelly.    BALTIMORE ORIOLES    Player GS IP ERA BB SO WHIP   Chris Tillman 31 184.1 4.00 62 145 1.28   Wei-Yin Chen 28 167.0 4.10 40 127 1.26   Bud Norris 27 160.1 4.21 56 130 1.35   Miguel Gonzalez 24 147.1 4.40 47 104 1.32   Ubaldo Jimenez 27 150.1 4.19 76 145 1.42    Kevin Gausman will force his way into this picture eventually, we can only hope, but for the beginning of the season, the best guess doesn\'t have him in the rotation picture. What we do have is a bunch of pessimistic projections for each of the pitchers. All of this has happened before. All of this will happen again. Other than Ubaldo, there\'s a real chance that each of the other four guys pitched as well as they\'re capable of pitching last season. Maybe they\'ll take what they learned and do it again. If so, it\'ll be another fun summer in Baltimore. If more than one pitcher gets hurt or struggles and they\'re forced into the O\'s depth beyond Gausman, that will be akin to crossing our fingers and praying. I asked the ESPN guys about the O\'s chances of repeating even though they didn\'t add anybody. Schilling called Gausman ""a potential kind of Matt Harvey in the AL"" and was positive about Tillman would be able to do with an extra year of experience. ** Trying to view the landscape of these rotations objectively, it\'s clear there are groups with higher potential upside than the Orioles. Tanaka, Pineda, Eovaldi, and Nova could turn into a nice quartet for New York. On the other hand, Tanaka\'s elbow could be a time bomb. Pineda threw 84 total innings last year and only about 40 the year before that. Nova has to get back from Tommy John.    The Rays, too, could find themselves with their usual assortment of solid young guns within a month of the season getting underway. The Jays have young arms who are potential difference-makers. Young arms don\'t necessarily make that immediate impact, though, nor is their progression always a linear thing. The bottom line is that fans of every team in the division should be feeling a bit nervous about the starting rotation. Perhaps you\'ll find it a bit of a copout for me to say that the team that ends up with the healthiest rotation will probably be the team with the best rotation. And in any case any one of these teams could win even if their starting pitchers aren\'t the best. It\'s a team game, after all. If the Orioles are going to find a way to repeat as AL East champions, they\'re going to need their five (or six) best starters to get them a lot of the way there. It happened last year. It could happen again.

Mandatory Credit: Peter G. Aiken-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles relief pitcher Zach Britton has made me a converted believer in the role of a closer. I suspect I am not the only one to have had such a revival in 2014.About this time every year I dust off an old article on closers, refine and update it just a bit, and put it out there as one of my best baseball pieces ever. The essence of it is to say that closers are more myth than reality, and that there are no more than a handful or so of pitchers each year who can be counted upon and slotted most nights to successfully accomplish this defined role.Actually, now that I think about it, I stand by my old analysis. By application, this is to say that the majority of teams do not have a reliever in the bullpen who is actually capable of fulfilling the defined expectation of the job. And if you are one of these (majority) teams, to try to designate a closer is to foolishly set yourself up to lose more games than if going with a nightly strategy of a \xe2\x80\x9ccloser by committee\xe2\x80\x9d approach. The role of a closer evolved from the inception of a statistic for it, rather than the statistic invented to track a baseball strategy.

In 2013, the Birds went back to him in that role, and back to him in that role, and back to him in that role; and the next thing they knew, he had blown so many saves that it was the #1 reason for only 85 wins and missing the playoffs.Johnson was traded, with much fan consternation. The silly Balfour saga came and went. And at the start of spring training 2014, there was no defined closer candidate. Tommy Hunter seemed the most likely candidate and it was his job to lose, which he ultimately did.But Zach Britton stepped up and saved the day, saved the season, and saved 37 games. Nobody clearly saw it coming, but looking back now it makes perfect sense. The best closers don\xe2\x80\x99t walk people, and they keep the ball on the ground and out of the air and over the fence.Britton showed up in 2014 with a filthy-nasty sinking fastball that is simply an awesome pitch. It can sometimes be nearly unhittable, and it is getting better as time goes by. His sinker could be categorically even more lethal to batters this year.Britton made 71 appearances in 2014, throwing 76.1 innings and giving up only 48 base hits. His WHIP was .904 \xe2\x80\x94 a fabulous number for 76 innings of work. The opponent batting average against him was .178, right-handers were .182 and lefties .170. \xc2\xa0He did give up four home runs and had four blown saves, but that is tolerable, as well as unlikely to grow bigger.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoEven if the Orioles do not repeat a 96-win season, look for Britton to get more than 37 saves.

I will have a complete predictions article coming very soon, but let me get a jump on it by saying that Zach Britton will set a new Orioles record with well over 50 saves and be acclaimed as one of the two or three best relievers in the game.And even if he fails at that, he could come back as a designated hitter.

04/03/2015,"[('Orioles beat Braves, 3-2, with Ubaldo kinda looking not ...', ' The Orioles played the penultimate game of their spring training schedule on Friday evening, taking a close 3-2 contest against the Braves. There is only one more of these fake games left and then the next Orioles game will be a real game. In about 66 hours, the games will count again and everything will matter.    In the MASN commercials hyping the broadcast of this game - it is one of the half dozen or so that they actually televised out of the Grapefruit League schedule - they drew attention to the fact that Ubaldo Jimenez would be starting by asking the viewer, ""Will Ubaldo pitch well this year?"" Yes, MASN, that is indeed what we\'d all like to know. The commercial\'s answer to this was, ""Spring will tell,"" an assertion they can safely make because whether it\'s right or wrong, no one will ultimately care. If we were willing to indulge the commercial that spring will tell for Ubaldo\'s performance in the regular season, his performance in tonight\'s game was about as much as you could hope for. At first it didn\'t seem that way, because nothing ever comes easy. Jimenez gave up a single to leadoff batter Eric Young Jr. and then gave up a double to Jace Peterson. He was trailing 1-0 before he ever recorded an out. Not a promising beginning. From there, however, Ubaldo avoided the full-on meltdown. He gave up a one-out walk but escaped the first inning without any further damage being done. In fact, after the Peterson double, Jimenez went on to retire 12 of the next 14 batters he faced, including 1-2-3 innings in both the third and fourth frames. He came out of the game after pitching only four innings, but this was by design rather than due to an elevated pitch count. Jimenez threw 61 pitches in getting through four innings - 43 of them were strikes.    There was a brief scare as Ubaldo was hit in the foot or ankle by a comebacker in the second inning. He stayed in the game, though O\'s reporters indicated that he had the ankle iced after the game. Perhaps that contributed to his early exit as well. In four innings of work, Jimenez struck out five batters, giving up one run on three hits and a walk. He looked like a real pitcher.       Over the whole game, O\'s pitchers only allowed five total hits. The other two Braves hits came in the eighth inning against Tommy Hunter, who allowed the Braves\' second run when former Oriole Kelly Johnson drove in Young, who led off the inning with a double. Orioles hitters only mustered seven hits in the game, though they helped their own chances to generate offense by also taking three walks. More than half of those hits came in the second inning of the game. Travis Snider and Manny Machado led off the bottom of the second with back-to-back singles, with Snider coming in to score on another RBI single by the next batter after Machado. A fielder\'s choice got Machado to third, where he scored the O\'s second run on an RBI sacrifice fly from Caleb Joseph.    Alejandro De Aza also singled in the inning, and when Steve Pearce was hit in the back by a breaking ball that never broke, the O\'s actually had the bases loaded. With only two outs, they needed a hit, but instead they got a Chris Davis groundout. De Aza brought in the third O\'s run of the game with a solo home run in the bottom of the fifth inning. That put the O\'s up 3-1 at that point, and the three runs held for the rest of the way. The home run was De Aza\'s third of the spring. A total of six O\'s relievers worked in the game. Brad Brach, Jason Garcia, and Zach Britton all pitched a scoreless inning each. Garcia was the only one of this trio to even allow a baserunner. He threw an inside pitch that grazed Jonny Gomes\' forearm. I\'m sure it still hurt. Brian Matusz pitched two-thirds of an inning, with Darren O\'Day getting a third of an inning.    Whether the O\'s will keep Garcia is a question that remains to be answered. He didn\'t give them a reason to get rid of him in tonight\'s game. The O\'s also set a record for average per game attendance since their move to Sarasota. They drew an average of 7,484 fans to their 15 spring home games, topping the previous record by 30 fans per game. Hey, a record is a record. The Orioles and Braves will play one last spring game at the Braves complex tomorrow afternoon beginning at 3:05 in the afternoon Eastern time. The game will not be televised but will be on both the Orioles Radio Network and the Braves Radio Network. Not many O\'s regulars are expected to make the trip.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this a couple of times this week, however I can\xe2\x80\x99t get over how bizarre the schedule is for the Birds here at the end of the Grapefruit League schedule, playing Atlanta three times in a row (twice in Orlando and once in Sarasota). I suppose that aside from the fact that the teams are going back-and-forth between the two parks, it almost mirrors a series in a way.The end of the regular season is always somewhat sad for players and fans come October, and I suspect that the same is true with the end of spring training for communities like Sarasota. It\xe2\x80\x99s been said here and in numerous other places time and time again, but the Orioles and Sarasota really embrace one another. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a partnership that exists on a year-round basis \xe2\x80\x93 not only in February and March.\xc2\xa0More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

We often hear about injured players heading down to Sarasota to work out over the course of the regular season. However the fact is that while the O\xe2\x80\x99s are a year-round institution in Sarasota, spring training is when the relationship is at it\xe2\x80\x99s most intimate. The O\xe2\x80\x99s move almost their entire operation to Ed Smith Stadium, and the Sarasota community returns the favor by embracing the Orioles and their fans.However as I said, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably always a little sad when Sarasota has to relinquish the Orioles to their true home, Baltimore. Yet the community goes on supporting the Orioles throughout the regular season as well. I recall that there was a group of Ed Smith Stadium workers who were getting together to watch games as the team made it\xe2\x80\x99s stretch run to the 2012 post season. The point is that as soon as the O\xe2\x80\x99s relocated their spring camp from Fort Lauderdale to Sarasota, they were embraced by the local community in a big way.Ed Smith Stadium\xe2\x80\x99s completion has also coincided with the resurgence of the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and I would submit that it\xe2\x80\x99s no coincidence. Now that players have a first class facility in which to work out from the very beginning of baseball activities (until the end), training can be at a better pace from point to point. The fans have responded to the new facility as well, as the O\xe2\x80\x99s drew over 89K fans last season at Ed Smith Stadium. And they\xe2\x80\x99re on par to better that this season. Incidentally, whereas when the Orioles played in Fort Lauderdale they had a tough time getting other teams to come to play them, now teams are lining up to have the O\xe2\x80\x99s host them at Ed Smith Stadium.This is all a testament to a mutual commitment by the Orioles and Sarasota to create a family and community environment that is beneficial both to the club and the local fans. And the great news for Sarasota-area Orioles fans is that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to give up the Orioles just yet, as the Birds open the regular season in nearby Tampa on Monday.However as they close the home slate of games at Ed Smith Stadium tonight, I hope that the O\xe2\x80\x99s and the local community tip their caps towards one another for another great camp on Florida\xe2\x80\x99s gulf coast. Ubaldo Jimenez will make his final start of the spring tonight, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s Shelby Miller.

That is a fact, and anything else may be spin. But here goes.The first two games were tied in the ninth inning before Kansas City pulled ahead. The Orioles lost the next two games by scores of 2-1. The Royals deserved their A.L. pennant, but things could have easily broken Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s way. The Orioles should not be forgotten as a new season begins.It might be easy to overlook the Orioles, who lost three well-known players in the off-season without adding brand-name replacements. The longtime right fielder Nick Markakis signed with Atlanta, the home run champion Nelson Cruz signed with Seattle and the left-handed reliever Andrew Miller signed with the Yankees.But in their three seasons together, Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter have forged a winning formula. Duquette, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 executive vice president for baseball operations, finds useful roster pieces, and Showalter, the manager, expertly deploys them around center fielder Adam Jones, the team\xe2\x80\x99s cornerstone. Names like Steve Pearce, Alejandro De Aza and Delmon Young may not be easy to market, but with Baltimore, they win.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsHaving previously written the past two days about predictions, first for the Baltimore Orioles pitching staff and then for the position players, this third segment of preseason predictions will speak of the overall team and where we might find them at the end of the day on Sunday, October 4th.At that time, after a season-ending seven-game homestand \xe2\x80\x93 with four games against Toronto and the final three with the Yankees \xe2\x80\x93 they will have a 93-69 record and five-game divisional championship over the second-place Blue Jays. This will mean that they will be able to capture the AL East title at home at the beginning of that week against that nemesis from Canada \xe2\x80\x93 and there will be a sense of justice surrounding it, given all that happened over this past winter. Can somebody give me an \xe2\x80\x9camen?\xe2\x80\x9dThere is no doubt that the Orioles benefitted from a down year of baseball during 2014 in the perennially tough AL East. The Birds won by a large margin and were the best team in the division, even if the others did not have a plethora of injuries. And as we well know, the O\xe2\x80\x99s were not immune from such either.Benefitting from a career year by Nelson Cruz, a breakout season by Steve Pearce and solid play from a handful of others including veterans Adam Jones, Nick Markakis and J.J. Hardy, it was the pitching staff that really made the difference. The bullpen was among the better relief staffs in all of baseball, but it was the solid pitching of the starting rotation over the final four months that accounted for the largest difference.Since that entire starting staff is back, and only a two-month rental in the bullpen is missing, this foundation is more than adequate in my view to place the Baltimore Orioles as a definitive favorite in the AL East. Without doubt, the division has strengthened \xe2\x80\x93 especially the Blue Jays and Red Sox. Even so, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 position players look prepared for a sufficient support of the pitching staff to carry the team to a title, albeit a bit closer than last year.I will not attempt to identify the other playoff participants from the other five divisions. Seattle looks to be well-positioned, and most everyone likes the Washington Nationals to power their way to the World Series on the strength of their pitching staff. It could well happen.I will predict the Orioles to make it to the American League Championship Series, but to sadly lose again and fall short of the Fall Classic. If the playoff games were played on a nearly-daily basis as is the regular season, I would pick the O\xe2\x80\x99s and Buck Showalter to fully prevail. But with it stretched out and with multiple travel and off days in the playoffs, this gives an advantage to teams with superstar players over squads with well-rounded lineups. Buck agrees with this assessment.So here is my AL East prediction \xe2\x80\xa6Baltimore \xe2\x80\x93 93-69Toronto \xe2\x80\x93 88-74Boston \xe2\x80\x93 85-77New York \xe2\x80\x93 80-82Tampa Bay \xe2\x80\x93 70-92How have I done with predictions in other years?\xc2\xa0 Well, I picked the O\xe2\x80\x99s to have 92 wins in 2014; and we know that they totaled 96. However, I did have them losing to the Rays by three games; and of course, the Rays had tons of injuries and fell apart. The Orioles did a little worse than what I thought in 2013, and just a bit better than my prediction in 2012. I did think that they would do very well in that breakout year, but did not expect they\xe2\x80\x99d actually make the playoffs. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryWe\xe2\x80\x99ve all heard a lot about how many baseball pundits have the Orioles predicted for a very mediocre season. The recent winning tradition of three years is simply not long enough to shake off the prior losing tradition. A common story is to think that there is insufficient replacement of Cruz and Markakis for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to repeat \xe2\x80\x93 a story espoused even by some Baltimore fans. I have written ad nauseam about how I believe that is a fully wrong-headed analysis.Here are some predictions for the AL East by other baseball writers (and I\xe2\x80\x99ll add a few more in articles in coming days \xe2\x80\xa6 also keeping all of these to either gloat over or mock in October!).Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with mlb.com columnist Richard Justice. Last year, he too had the Rays on top with the Orioles and Red Sox as challengers. Last week he wrote in a great column\xe2\x80\xa6Let\xe2\x80\x99s get out in front of this thing here and now. The Baltimore Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t sneaking up on anyone this time. Fooled me once\xe2\x80\xa6 Are they going to win the American League East for the second year in a row? They just might. In fact, they probably deserve to be the favorite.It is always good to see converts to wisdom and justice \xe2\x80\xa6 kinda like his name.Actually there is some love for the Baltimore Orioles from the CBSSports.com staff of Jon Heyman, Mike Axisa, David Brown, Dayn Perry and Matt Snyder. Two of them have the Orioles winning, two choose the O\xe2\x80\x99s for second place, and one places them third.Amazingly, 10 out of 15 baseball experts at ESPN have the Orioles winning the AL East, with four choosing the Jays and one taking the Red Sox. But only one of the 10 who picked Baltimore sees them in the World Series, and that would be Jayson Stark; but he predicts them to lose to the Nationals.Like many of the major sports sites, when talking about the AL East, the USA TODAY gang speaks of it as throwing a dart at a board in order to choose a winner. Others sites call it a horse race with no clear favorite. But the power rankings at USA TODAY go with the Red Sox first, Jays second, Orioles third, Rays fourth, and some other team you\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of in the basement.There is not a lot of love at Yahoo.com Sports for the Baltimore Orioles. In what they call a \xe2\x80\x9cwide-open division,\xe2\x80\x9d two of three writers take the Red Sox, while another picks the Blue Jays. Two have the Orioles finishing third, and one places them fourth. The guy placing them fourth \xe2\x80\x93 Mark Townsend \xe2\x80\x93 calls for Adam Jones to be the top hitter in the AL East. I love Adam, but I\xe2\x80\x99d never write something like that!Writing and predicting crazy things before a 162-game season begins is what makes baseball such a great sport. Nobody ever gets it completely right; there are always unanticipated storylines that make for great interest and pundit upsets. ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

Noonan says Orioles baseball is a great play for all of Maryland. \xe2\x80\x9cIt impacts the region, it impacts out by the airport, even the Eastern Shore. So, it has a huge economic engine for not even just the city of Baltimore, but for the entire region,\xe2\x80\x9d Noonan said.

What does this do for the hotel\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line?\xe2\x80\x9d Carralero: \xe2\x80\x9cFirst quarter is always a little bit tough because of the winter season. But for us, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly very beneficial.\xe2\x80\x9d For all of us,here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping the Orioles have another winning season. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great when the Orioles do well, because we do well,\xe2\x80\x9d Walsh said.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsHow are the Baltimore Orioles possibly going to replace Nelson Cruz and Nick Markakis? That was the big question and largest concern over the offseason. It is the loss of those players that has the Orioles rated over and over in one source after another as a .500 team at best.

Along with excellent starting pitching from Chris Tillman who went 6.2 innings, the players of the game were the corner outfielders: Travis Snider and Alejandro De Aza \xe2\x80\xa6 as well as Steve Pearce, another corner outfielder playing first base on this occasion.In the first inning, De Aza did what leadoff guys are supposed to do \xe2\x80\x93 get on base and score runs. He did so by speed, causing the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 starting pitcher Chris Archer to throw the ball over the first baseman\xe2\x80\x99s head on a grounder (see photo above). De Aza would score on Snider\xe2\x80\x99s single that beat the shift \xe2\x80\x93 love seeing that!De Aza would open the game up with a two-run shot to give the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 3-0 lead. This was on the 10th pitch of an at-bat \xe2\x80\x93 another skill exhibited at the plate. As well, he would later in the game cut off a double in deep left-center field that would save a run from scoring \xe2\x80\x93 an additional run that would have, at that point, cut the O\xe2\x80\x99s lead to 5-3. That now-forgotten fellow who played left field and homered in the opener last season would have never gotten to that ball \xe2\x80\xa6 just sayin.\xe2\x80\x99Snider not only drove in the first run of the game and season, he also doubled home the fifth run for the Birds while gathering three hits. He threw out a runner at the plate on a one-hopper and also made a diving catch.Both corner outfielders have nice, quick swings; they are going to be fine. The Orioles are going to be fine. I figured it would be a year, or two at the most, that we would be fine with seeing Cruz and Markakis gone; but maybe it happened in the first game of the season?Steve Pearce Confuses MeI have to confess that I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been more wrong about a player than Pearce. I would have given up on him long, long before he broke through in 2014. I still can\xe2\x80\x99t see how it does it. He does not look the part of a contributing player. Pearce looked really bad in this first two at-bats, but then he suddenly drops the bat head on a pitch and sends it out of the park. Beyond that, he made what might be the oddest baserunnning play of the season in scoring on Snider\xe2\x80\x99s double. May the confusion continue!One Caveat \xe2\x80\xa6 Actually Two \xe2\x80\xa6Have to say it \xe2\x80\x93 the Rays are not a very good team at all. Some of these unfamiliar names may figure it out and put together enough to win some games. But they look especially bad in the field. And final proof is yielding a home run to Ryan Flaherty on a 0-2 count for the sixth run in the ninth inning. It actually cost Zach Britton a save, so even when he does something right, it is wrong! Just kidding. Maybe. Probably not.The worst performance of the day?\xc2\xa0 Home plate umpire Dana DeMuth \xe2\x80\x93 horrible strike zone. Major League Baseball has got to do something to get strike zones fixed.Next: The Orioles are historically a great season opening team ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Power and pitching rule on Tillman Island', 'From game 1 to game 162, baseball begins and ends with starting pitching. The good news for the Baltimore Orioles is that their ace, Chris Tillman, answered the call yesterday as the O\xe2\x80\x99s defeated Tampa 6-2 on Opening Day. It can be hard pitching the opener given the pressure to start fast out of the gate. In last year\xe2\x80\x99s opener Tillman struggled a bit with command and nerves, although the Orioles managed to win. But as he told Roch Kubatko of MASNsports after the game, this year was different:It was much easier today. You\xe2\x80\x99re always going to have the nerves on opening day, but it was nothing like last year. I was able to keep it under control, starting in the bullpen and coming into the game. I was happy with it.Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.2 I, 4 H, 1 R, 3 BB, 4 K. The O\xe2\x80\x99s jumped on top early by playing the role of opportunists. Alejandro De Aza hit a dribbler up the first base line out of the lead off spot \xe2\x80\x93 a ball that appeared destined to be an out. However Tampa pitcher Chris Archer threw the ball high to first and into right field, allowing De Aza to reach on an error. A walk, a sac fly (to move De Aza to third), and a Travis Snider RBI-single later, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had an early 1-0 lead in the first inning on Opening Day.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal2/17 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Johnson wants to revitalize his careerCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThat was obviously an unearned run, however in the fifth inning De Aza would tack on one that was earned, by way of a two-run homer. An inning later Steve Pearcee would add a solo shot of his own, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a 4-0 lead as we went into the later innings. However not to be outdone, Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s Evan Longoria got his team on the board with a solo homer in the seventh, cutting the lead to 4-1.In the eighth Snider, who had one heck of a first game with the Orioles, smacked a double to right field. Steve Pearce came around third to score, however he appeared to be dead in the water at home plate. However Tampa right fielder Steven Souza\xe2\x80\x99s throw was a bit high, and Pearce had the foresight to slide. Speaking for myself, it caught me off guard at first. Rivera, the Tampa catcher, was literally waiting at home plate with the ball well before Pearce arrived. If anything, it would have made more sense for Pearce to just accept a token soft tag and walk back to the dugout, right?Probably. However as I said, the throw was high. Pearce attempted to slide under the tag, and at first it appeared that he was unsuccessful because he was called out. Buck Showalter challeneged the play from the dugout, and in fact replays were fairly conclusive to the effect that Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s foot had crossed home plate prior to the tag. The call was reversed and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a 5-1 lead.Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s Astrubal Cabrera would add an RBI-double in the eighth, however Ryan Flaherty would insert his name into the homer parade with a solo shot of his own in the ninth inning to close out the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 6-2 victory on Opening Day. It got a little hairy in the last of the eighth when Tommy Hunter allowed the aforementioned RBI-double, as that gave Tampa two runners in scoring position. However Hunter induced a pop up with two outs by Longoria, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s ended the threat. Zach Britton also retired Tampa 1-2-3 in the ninth \xe2\x80\x93 in a non-save situation.The Orioles got some great efforts yesterday out of guys who were in theory replacing departed players. De Aza, Pearce, and Flaherty all homered, and Snider was responsible for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first run of the game and of the season with an RBI-single. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the type of production that the Orioles are going to need up and down the lineup in order to repeat as AL East champions.Snider also showed us that he can be an asset in right field, gunning down a would-be run at home plate in the fifth. With two outs, James Loney tried to score from second on Logan Forsythe\xe2\x80\x99s single to right field. However Snider came up throwing, and with ice water in his veins relayed the ball to catcher Caleb Joseph and gunned down Loney.Incidentally, Tampa challenged the play under the premise that Joseph blocked the plate before the ball arrived. However the umpires upheld the call, as replays showed that there was in fact a clear path to the plate for the runner. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re keeping score at home, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are 1-0 in challenges this year, and opponents are 0-1. Last season you might remember that the Orioles had a long drought on challenges early in the season \xe2\x80\x93 for whatever any of that is worth.Again, this is only game 1 out of 162 \xe2\x80\x93 but it\xe2\x80\x99s always nice to get off to a good start. The Orioles will make a roster move prior to game two this evening, as Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 suspension is officially now complete. While nothing is set in stone until it\xe2\x80\x99s done, word on the street is that Steve Clevenger will be optioned to Norfolk to make room for Davis on the roster. If you think about it, the timing really worked out great for the Orioles. As opposed to returning in the post season last year after having sat for a month-and-a-half, Davis now returns after sitting one game\xe2\x80\xa6but in the wake of spring training. He should be ready to rock.The Orioles and Tampa will continue their series this evening as Wei-Yin Chen heads to the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s in game two. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Nathan Karns, with game time set for just after 7 PM.Next: Baltimore Orioles: AL East predictions  ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Snider an Alejandro De Aza (who hit lead off again) have both been very pleasant surprises thus far for the Orioles, which I know is making fans feel a lot more comfortable in terms of Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 absence.Adam Jones would add a two-RBI double to centerfield, and Manny Machado would tack on a sac fly-RBI to give the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 4-0 lead on Tampa starter Nathan Karns right out of the gate. An inning later, Steve Pearce would add a two-run home run, and the Birds held a 6-0 lead.

Tampa would net a run on a Steven Souza RBI-groundout in the third, and an inning later Logan Forsythe\xc2\xa0would put his team right back in the game with a two-run homer.

Showalter brought in closer Zach Britton, despite having thrown 19 pitches on Monday to close out the game. Britton went deep into each count, but ended up striking out the side \xe2\x80\x93 each time using a pretty nasty fastball (in terms of location) for strike three.Many fans might look at this game and say that the O\xe2\x80\x99s were lucky to hold on and win since Tampa seemed to have the momentum from the second inning on.

Despite the defeat, the Birds did win their opening series of the 2015 baseball season two games to one. Of course, Baltimore manager Buck Showalter will take a series victory in a heartbeat.  Tampa Bay RHP Jake Odorizzi held the Orioles to only two hits in 6.2 IP to pick up the first career win for Rays manager Kevin Cash. Odorizzi struck out seven and walked none as the Rays avoided the sweep.  Following the second inning of the Orioles 6-5 triumph on Tuesday night, Tampa Bay pitchers put the Baltimore bats on ice. The Birds were shutout for the final 16 innings of the series and went five for their last 55 at the plate. They struck out 13 times in the series finale and a total of 29 times over the course of three games.  As for the starting pitching, the Orioles got a solid performance from RHP Chris Tillman on Opening Day. In the next two games, Showalter got subpar outings from LHP Wei-Yin Chen and RHP Miguel Gonzalez. No need to start pushing panic buttons, however. Both will be fine in the long run.

Unfortunately, Harvey is not going to start the season with the Keys due to the broken bone he suffered during spring training. Hopefully he\'ll get to show up some time in the month of May. Even without Harvey, the Keys have some names worth keeping an eye on.    Last year\'s edition of the Keys had a 65-72 record in the Carolina League. That\'s the kind of thing you\'d expect from a team that didn\'t have many of the organization\'s top prospects, most of whom were either ensconced above or working their way up from below the High-A level. Orlando Gomez, a past Keys manager and the winningest manager in Keys history, returns to manage the team this season. Players to watch Hunter Harvey, RHP The Orioles\' first round draft pick from 2013 figures to get in a good bit of time for Frederick once he\'s healthy. Harvey has been rated as high as the #20 prospect in all of baseball by Baseball Prospectus. He struck out 106 batters in 87.2 innings of work for Delmarva last year, and prospect evaluators including ESPN\'s Keith Law were surprised Harvey didn\'t get a promotion towards the end of last year. If he excels in Frederick he may not stay all year. If you live around Frederick, go see him when you can. Chance Sisco, C Sisco is the top positional prospect in the organization and some might say the only positional prospect worth getting excited about. The O\'s second round pick from the 2013 draft won the batting title in the South Atlantic League with a .340 batting average. Drafted out of high school, he\'ll be only 20 this season, so O\'s fans shouldn\'t envision him as an immediate replacement to Matt Wieters. He is well-regarded enough to land at #101 on the BP 101.    Jon Keller, RHP The 6\'5"" Keller was lights out in relief for Delmarva last season, putting up 1.59 ERA in 56.2 innings. His season was cut short by a strain of his left intercostal muscle. It\'s a long road to the majors for a 22nd round pick like Keller and quite a drop in prospect quality from Harvey and Sisco to Keller. He\'s 22, so if he is successful as a reliever at this level, he may not spend the whole year here. Drew Dosch, 3B Lefty-batting Dosch was another solid bat in the Delmarva lineup last year after being a 7th round pick in the 2013 draft. He batted .314/.379/.404 for the Shorebirds, but he was old for the level as he was a senior sign. He\'ll again be old for the Carolina League as he\'s set to turn 23 in June. There\'s a place for late bloomers in the big leagues, however. Just ask Steve Pearce. Dosch might be able to show he\'s worth bringing up another level. Others Shortstop Adrian Marin will be back for his second year at Frederick, hoping that he can take a step forward offensively. Outfielder Josh Hart was the O\'s competitive balance pick in the 2013 draft, a high school draftee like Harvey and Sisco. The awesomely-named Sebastian Vader finished up the year with the Keys and he\'ll be starting this year there.

In 2011 an 18 year old Manny Machado ranged the middle infield alongside 19 year old Jonathan Schoop. In 2012 Dylan Bundy laid waste to South Atlantic League hitters, while a 19 year old Eduardo Rodriguez began to make himself into a prospect of note. 2013 introduced Orioles fans to Josh Hader and Christian Walker. While last season provided us with our first glimpse of the talented Mr. Hunter Harvey.    The 2015 Shorebirds won\'t feature a big-name prospect a la Manny, or Dylan, or a 1st Round draft pick such as Harvey. But they do have a solid core of kids who bear monitoring as possible farm system headliners in the near future. So who should you be scooping out should you find yourself in the friendly confines of Arthur Perdue Stadium? Let\'s have a looksee... Jomar Reyes, 3B Shorebirds Manager Ryan Minor is listed at 6\'7"" and 240 lbs. The just-turned 18 year old Reyes may soon eclipse his manager on both fronts. He is gigantic. And within that stout frame lies the potential energy capable of swatting baseballs into the stratosphere. In a farm system which does not boast much raw power, Reyes exudes it from his pores. He played 53 games for the Gulf Coast League O\'s in 2014 managing a slash line of .285 / .333 / .425 with 4 home runs and a 38:15 K:BB ratio. In his\xc2\xa0Evaluating the Prospects write-up, Fangraphs\' Kiley McDaniel place Reyes 6th in the O\'s farm system hierarchy, noting that Reyes is more than just a thumper:    ""Reyes also has\xc2\xa0the surprising ability to hit and work counts, given his size and age. One scout said his at-bats are just as advanced as Christian Walker or Dariel Alvarez, two of the more advanced hitters in the system. A big reason for that consistency\xc2\xa0is Reyes\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0balanced, low-effort, loose, repeatable swing mechanics.""     Reyes will be one of the youngest players in the SAL, and a strong season could push him all the way to the top of the O\'s prospect list come this time next year.    Brian Gonzalez, LHP While the Shorebirds will not feature a 1st Round draft pick, they will feature a first-overall draft pick in the person of Brian Gonzalez. The 19 year old southpaw was the O\'s first selection in 2014, albeit in the 3rd Round, after the 1st & 2nd round selections were forfeited with the signings of Ubaldo Jimenez and Nelson Cruz, and the Competitive Draft Lottery awarded pick (#37 overall) was sent to Houston in the Bud Norris deal. After signing Gonzalez made 8 starts in the GCL squad wherein he yielded but 1 unearned run. That\'ll garner some attention. So the power that be sent him packing from his native Florida with a ticket marked \'Aberdeen\' on it\'s destination. He made two starts for the Ironbirds, and yours truly got to see him pitch in Aberdeen in the second of those starts. My (totally uninformed) impressions from my notes: he\'s a thick kid; going to have to work hard on his conditioning. Good frame to build on. Fastball 88-89 with little natural movement. Moves ball around zone well. Curve and Change 72-74 with good arm action.    The bulk of the O\'s pitching prospects have now ascended to the AA & AAA levels. The club will be counting on Gonzalez to develop into part of the next wave of young arms as the previous generation moves up to the majors.  Jonah Heim, C The Orioles stocked up on catchers in the 2013 draft. Chance Sisco in the 2nd round, local product Alex Murphy in the 6th round, Austin Wynns in the 10th round, and Jonah Heim in the 4th round. Sisco received the bulk of the attention last season after a stellar full-season debut with Delmarva. Heim will look to follow in that path in \'15. A long and lean (listed at 6\'3"", 190 lbs.) switch hitter, he hasn\'t found much in the way of statistical success thus far between the GCL and Aberdeen. But he has time to develop at the plate as he won\'t turn 20 until late June. Thus far the organization has seen to refining his skills as a backstop.\xc2\xa0MLB.com wrote the following concerning his receiving skills:  While still very young, Heim has already shown excellent, receiving, blocking and throwing skills. He\'s mature beyond his years, calling his own game and working extremely well with pitchers. Heim moves well behind the plate and his strong arm has already helped shut down running games.     So while Sisco demonstrated himself to be a threat with the bat in \'14, it may be Heim who is the one to watch as the ultimate future backstop in Baltimore. After those three there isn\'t much to get excited about. 24 year old OFer Elier Leyva was signed out of Cuba. But if you are a 24 year old playing in Low-A, well...we\'ll see. 3Bman Austin Anderson slashed .307 / .354 / .407 for Aberdeen last season, one of the few bright spots for the Ironbirds\' dismal offense. But he will serve a 50 game suspension at the outset of the season after testing positive for an amphetamine over the winter. John Means is a 6\'3"" lefty drafted out of West Virginia last year. He will pitch in the rotation and could be a fast mover through the system. RHP Derrick Bleeker converted from an outfielder to a bullpen arm last year and could be of interest very quickly.

The Rays won 2-0. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThe regular baseball season is underway! The Baltimore Orioles will be home on Friday for their season opener. There is no bad news that is bigger than this good news. Now, if we can just get some cooperative weather in Maryland, that would be awesome.So what can we take away from the opening series against the Tampa Bay Rays, beyond the fact that the Orioles are 2-1? And though we may have wished for a sweep, we all know that winning two out of three games over the course of a season is more than enough to end up with the best record in MLB.As always with the Orioles (and I suppose this is true of most teams at most times), it is a mixed bag of results and trends. But here are five takeaways that are going through my mind right now \xe2\x80\xa6The Baltimore Orioles can be a very explosive team.On several occasions over the first two games we saw the O\xe2\x80\x99s going on an offensive feeding frenzy. Three home runs in game one remind of the firepower on this team. Beginning the second game with four consecutive hits and situational hitting to bring them all home; this is the stuff of winners. There is definitely more speed on this Orioles squad than we have seen in a while. The Birds are indeed a team that can score runs in bunches and in a short time.The Baltimore Orioles can go into extended hitting funks and be shut down by good pitching.Just about the time you start to get excited with the Orioles getting on base and scoring runs (like 12 of them in 11 innings), they go into an offensive funk and pass through 16 innings with zero runs and only four hits. They also strike out 13 times in one game. Over the series, the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 batting average was .185, so it really is pretty awesome that they were able to win two-of-three ballgames. Even with some exciting moments from Alejandro De Aza, it is not encouraging that the leadoff hitter is already leading the team in strikeouts (though my money is still on Chris Davis to do that in the end).The talent is on this O\xe2\x80\x99s team to sufficiently replace the Losses of Cruz and Markakis.The first game of the year was such an interesting and affirming exhibit that the combination of De Aza, Steve Pearce, and Travis Snider can make some things happen. In total, they are not going to even be a downgrade in the field. And when it is all said and done, I am going to guess that the total number of home runs from outfielders and designated hitters in 2015 may not lag honestly that much behind the stats from the same positional personnel last year. At the same time, I will bet that the batting average is actually higher and offsets the power losses. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see; the talent is there.For championship success, the Orioles are going to need a strong majority of players performing at the top ends of their historic performances.That last sentence is just about the least analytical piece of mere common sense as I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever written. This is true of any team at any time. The Orioles had this happen in 2014, especially with pitchers. The Red Sox had it occur in 2013.So far we have seen Chris Tillman and Zach Britton clearly display this. We could say the same for Sinder, De Aza and Pearce. However, the majority of the others are looking to still have some rust to shake off. How well they do that, and do it fairly quickly, will determine the team level of success for this year.

Apart from those who have permanent homes in or near Sarasota, it is extended hotel life. Ever have the experience of looking forward to a vacation, but then after a while looking forward to getting back to your own home and bed?Spring training can become a tedious experience. The pitchers certainly need the length of it in order to be ready for the stresses of the season. The hitters?\xe2\x80\xa6 not so much. The journalists covering it also find it to be very, very long (not that I don\xe2\x80\x99t still envy that particular piece of suffering).So it is sort of insult to injury to add the first series of the season against a team just an hour north of one\xe2\x80\x99s own training facilities. After the second inning of the second game, the Orioles REALLY look like a team that needs a change of pace and scenery.Final thought \xe2\x80\x93 All of this is to say that, at this point, I do have some conflicted feelings about where this season could go. I still think the chances are better than average that it is another successful campaign at the top of the AL East. But this team is not free of warts and cracks\xe2\x80\xa6 though what team really is? And that\xe2\x80\x99s why they play the game.

Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-USA TODAY SportsOver the years of Buck Showalter managing the Baltimore Orioles, there have been more than one or two players who have said that their manager seems to so often know what is going to happen before it happens. There is no doubt that he has a keen eye for the game of baseball. Having been around it for so long and seen so much, he is able to pick up on subtle trends that are either positive or negative and essentially have a premonition about what might well transpire next. And then it does!Sometimes Buck even backs into a prophetic utterance. Before the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 opening game yesterday he was worrying about the weather and its effect upon game, particularly the starting pitcher. The worst-case scenario would be to play an inning and then have a 90-minute rain delay that knocks the starter out after throwing maybe only 15 pitches.But it even caught my ear and unsettled me just a bit when, before the game, Showalter innocently said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to try to at least start when there\xe2\x80\x99s a window to get the starting pitcher. Of course, the other team might not let him get through the first inning anyway. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it works.\xe2\x80\x9dNO! Don\xe2\x80\x99t say something like that. Four runs in the first inning off Bud Norris would follow, with eight runs charged over three innings. Final score, 12-5, and a rough day for the home opener.But it gets worse. After the game the prophet said of the Blue Jays,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re as athletically talented as you\xe2\x80\x99ll see in the major leagues. Quality arms, too. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a lot of fun this summer.\xe2\x80\x9dOh man! Did not need to hear that! But, it really is no secret that the Jays are likely to be the team to have to beat in the AL East this year.It is hard to believe that we find ourselves looking forward to Ubaldo Jimenez facing the Jays with his nasty stuff on Saturday. Hopefully he packed the command that he found in his final spring outings and has brought it along from Florida. Norris simply did not have command, and without that, most days are going to be difficult for any pitcher in the big leagues.Is there reason to worry about Norris? I have to say that I do think so. Something has been clearly missing this entire spring. Of this subject Buck said, \xe2\x80\x9cBud pitched well. You don\xe2\x80\x99t win the games he\xe2\x80\x99s won or done the things he\xe2\x80\x99s done in the big leagues without handling some different situations along the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Yes, 2014 was a great year, and there is reason to hope he will yet regain that form. Yet at the same time, last year was the only season in his career where the numbers and performance were in the top half of rotation starters. Remember that just a year ago it was very uncertain that Norris would even have a spot in the rotation.How about some of the other Orioles players who are scuffling at bit here at the beginning? How about Manny Machado? Reason to worry?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. He has a couple of times in his career already had some slow starts before putting it together consistently.How about Brad Brach with his 12.00 ERA at the moment? I think he will be fine. His velocity and movement seem sufficient to recover his 2014 form.

He had a scant few starts like that all of last year. He started the 2015 season off with a gem of a game and that will be the first impression anyone has of him all year. Things will be good in Birdland if Ubaldo can keep looking anything like the version of himself who showed up to face Toronto tonight.    While Ubaldo was working his magic, the Orioles hitters jumped on Jays starter Aaron Sanchez in the game's first inning and they kept scoring throughout the game, slugging their way to what eventually became a 7-1 victory. Sanchez had a problem in the first inning. That problem was left-handed hitters. He gave up a solo home run to Alejandro De Aza to lead off the game. You can't get a better start than that. Sanchez then struck out Steve Pearce before giving up another solo home run, this time to Chris Davis, who muscled the ball over the fence to the opposite field. This was the big question with Davis. Would he have that opposite field power this year? Tonight he did, another good sign for the team's chances this year. The Orioles had another major threat against Sanchez in the third inning. Three straight singles by De Aza, Pearce, and Davis gave them bases loaded with no one out. That's prime time to strike and do major damage. It's also prime time for Adam Jones to swing at the first pitch and ground into a double play. That plated the third Orioles run, even if nobody would get credit for the RBI.    While all of this was going on, Jimenez was putting the Jays hitters to shame. He was perfect through three innings, only giving up a leadoff hit in the fourth inning to Jose Reyes. This ball was very nearly caught by De Aza in left field. It bounced just in front of him instead. Reyes later walked in the sixth inning. No other Jays hitter reached base against Jimenez.    A second bases loaded, nobody out situation presented itself in the fifth inning. Jones led off with a single, then back-to-back walks to Travis Snider and Manny Machado loaded them up against Jays reliever Todd Redmond. When you get a pitcher like Redmond on the ropes, the only thing to do is knock him out. Jonathan Schoop obliged, crushing a mistake pitch from Redmond into the left field seats for a grand slam. That gave the Orioles a 7-0 lead.    When all was said and done, Jimenez left the game after seven innings of work. He only allowed one walk and one hit and he struck out eight Jays batters. They were off balance and never knew quite what to make of his pitches. He threw 96 pitches and 61 of them were strikes. He looked like a real starting pitcher.    Of course, it was only one start. He had good starts last year even in the midst of all of the awful ones: 7.1 shutout innings, ten strikeouts against the Twins tucked into a random game in May, 8 innings, no earned runs, eight strikeouts against the Rangers towards the end of June last year. This one only stands out right now because it was his first one. He needs to follow it up with more than this. He's certainly gotten off on the correct foot. The O's picked up their seven runs on nine hits. Sure helps when you can get four runs in one swing. De Aza and Davis were both Orioles with multi-hit games. Snider had no hits but drew a pair of walks in four plate appearances, which actually lowered his on-base percentage to .550. As a team, the O's walked six times. I know, really! Tommy Hunter pitched the eighth for the O's. The only baserunner he allowed came when he hit Russell Martin in the back with a pitch. This may have been something of a purpose pitch as Davis had been hit by Redmond earlier in the game. The situation did not escalate.    Toronto scored its only run off of Zach Britton in the ninth inning. Britton was getting an inning to keep him from getting too rusty, having not pitched since Wednesday. One run scored on two hits. A leadoff double by Steve Tolleson might have been corralled by Machado. Manny made it up to Britton later in the inning by pulling off\xc2\xa0this piece of defensive wizardry.

Much of the sports talk around town yesterday had that same theme; what if that 12-5 loss on Friday was in reality the Orioles being exposed? Part of the beauty of baseball is that you play again the next day. And often times, results can reverse themselves.Ubaldo Jimenez might have pitched his best outing as an Orioles in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 8 K. Yes folks, that\xe2\x80\x99s a one-hitter (over seven innings, that is) and an 8:1 strikeout to walk ratio. I think that Orioles fans would have taken Jimenez pitching well enough to win the game, but instead what they got was a game in which he turned in perhaps a career performance. Jimenez walked off the mound after the seventh inning to a rousing ovation from the fans, causing him to say this to MLB.com\xe2\x80\x99s Brittany Ghiroli after the game:\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Every time I was pounding the strike zone, they were very excited. We got our first win at home; [it] feels great.Whereas the Orioles trailed from the beginning on Friday, the inverse was trueCourtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY Sportslast night. After Jimenez disposed of Toronto in the top of the first, Alejandro De Aza led off with a solo home run. That was followed up by a moon shot the opposite way to left field by Chris Davis, his first home run of the season. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re keeping score at home, that\xe2\x80\x99s two in home team\xe2\x80\x99s column before some folks in the crowd had even settled down.With two runners on and nobody out in the last of the third Chris Davis came to bat again \xe2\x80\x93 this time sending a shallow liner to right. The runner was held at third out of respect to the arm of Jose Bautista, who promptly gunned the ball home. That brought Adam Jones to the plate with the bases loaded. Jones\xe2\x80\x99 bat was probably a little happy as he swung at the first pitch, grounding into a double play \xe2\x80\x93 and scoring the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 third run of the game. However keep in mind that on Friday Toronto was lauded for using their outs to create additional runs; that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely what Jones did in the third inning last night.Jones came up to bat again in the last of the fifth, sending a base hit to left field \xe2\x80\x93 followed by both Travis Snider and Manny Machado walking to load the bases. That brought Jonathan Schoop to the plate, once again with the bases loaded and nobody out. Toronto reliever Todd Redmond gave him one right down the middle on a 1-1 count, and Schoop didn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6from the beginning, everyone in the ballpark knew it was gone. However I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that anyone knew how far it would fly. Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s homer went to the back of the first section of seats in left field. It was his first career grand slam, and perhaps more importantly it opened the game wide open. Schoop is turning into the power hitter that the Orioles knew he could be from the beginning, and he showed that in a big way last night.Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s lone run came in the ninth inning on Edwin Encarnacion\xe2\x80\x98s infield RBI-single. But the big story of last night\xe2\x80\x99s game was Jimenez, who as i said might have pitched his best game as an Oriole last night. Many folks correctly pointed out on Friday that Bud Norris struggled in the spring, and that seemed to continue into the regular season. But the inverse is true with Jimenez, and you really have to tip your cap to him knowing how hard he worked in spring training to get to where he proved he was last night.Many people wanted to paint Toronto as world beaters and the Orioles as being in trouble after Friday\xe2\x80\x99s game, and perhaps with good reason. But as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, you can\xe2\x80\x99t follow baseball the way you do football. a 162-game season is a true marathon, and things can change at the drop of a dime. Incidentally, if you take one positive from Friday\xe2\x80\x99s game it would have to be that Oriole bats actually had some pop. That continued last night.Prior to the game the Orioles placed reliever Wesley Wright on the DL, and brought up knuckler Eddie Gamboa to take his roster spot. (If Gamboa gets into a game it\xe2\x80\x99ll be his big league debut.) Wright is suffering from a shoulder strain, and had been feeling pain for a few days according to Buck Showalter. Gamboa\xe2\x80\x99s stay with the Orioles could be short, as David Lough will play in two rehab games starting today. The plan is for him to come off the DL after that, potentially making Gamboa the corresponding roster move. That would give the Orioles a full bench and bullpen.The series with Toronto concludes this afternoon at Camden Yards, with Chris Tillman on the mound for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Drew Hutchinson, with game time set for just after 1:30 PM.

Rodon scuffled to start the 5th as he walked Jayson Nix and Henry Urrutia before allowing Michael Almanzar to single. A fielding error on the play allowed Urrutia to score all the way from 1B, halving the lead at the time. With the bases now empty Rodon composed himself and closed out the inning, and his night, without further damage.    That would also be it for any Tides offense, as they would go on to K an additional 7 times over the final 4 innings for a gaudy sum of 16 on the night. Every batter save Dariel Alvarez and Paul Janish K\'d at least twice. T.J.

Bowie 7, Richmond (Giants) 6 (14 Innings) Parker Bridwell made his first AA start, and it got off to a rocky start. A single, a walk, a hit-by-pitch, a sacrifice fly, and a triple in succession added up to 3 runs on the board in the 1st inning. But the 23 year old righty would allow no further offense save a lead off double to open the 2nd. His final line : 5 IP, 3 H, 3 ER, 1 BB, 1 HBP, and 9 Ks. Not too shabby, even with the early hiccup.    The two offenses traded runs in the 6th & 7th innings before settling in to a 6-all stalemate. A two-out rally in the 14th put an end to that as Quincy Latimore doubled and would then score on Mike McDade\'s groundball single. Mr. Latimore had himself a night, going 3 for 6, with 3 runs scored. Glynn Davis put his speed to good use in the 1st inning. After drawing a walk he stole 2nd, moved to 3rd on an infield groundout, and then scored via a single. He has 3 SBs already this season.

(WJZ) \xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore Orioles outfielder Nolan Reimold slapped Johns Hopkins Hospital with a multi-million dollar lawsuit.   Derek Valcourt has details on how Reimold says the hospital hurt him. This all centers on a surgery Reimold had in 2012.  He says doctors let him back in the game too soon. Nolan Reimold was a rising star in 2009 but physical injuries started taking a toll and in June of 2012, doctors at Johns Hopkins ordered surgery to fuse two of his neck bones together, causing Reimold to miss the rest of the season. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing.  I wanted to not just individually but collectively too, because the team has been playing well,\xe2\x80\x9d Reimold said at the time. About seven months after the surgery, doctors cleared him to return to baseball\xe2\x80\x94but this lawsuit filed by Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys claims Hopkins and the doctor negligently misinterpreted that Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s neck bones had fused together when they had not.   After a brief return to the Orioles, he was forced to leave again for a second surgery. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a collosal mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said his attorney Hassan Murphy. Attorney Hassan Murphy says the doctor erred in releasing Reimold to play in spite in contrary X-rays.  A second surgery was successful and Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s now back with the O\xe2\x80\x99s, although for now not on the major league roster.  His lawyers say the doctor and Hopkins should be held responsible for the time he missed on the field in the prime of his life. \xe2\x80\x9cNolan has played for two years with minor league contacts, which would have never been the case had his career not been derailed the way it had been,\xe2\x80\x9d Murphy said. A spokesman for the hospital says due to privacy and the litigation, there\xe2\x80\x99s little they can say on the matter, other than \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe that Johns Hopkins met the standards of care for this particular surgery.\xe2\x80\x9d Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys say they will ask for millions of dollars in damages.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe early portion of this 2015 Baltimore Orioles baseball season has been a bit disquieting in seeing a number of the veteran players really struggling to contribute positively. But several of them made significant contributions on Wednesday night in a good 7-5 victory over the Yankees that put the series of games in the O\xe2\x80\x99s win column.The first among these was Bud Norris. No, it is not like he was the bulldog of a year ago with a great start, but it was an improvement and step in the right direction. We still don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see the O\xe2\x80\x99s starter giving up three runs in five innings, but Norris kept the bleeding from being too bad and in fact registered seven strikeouts with only five hits and two walks. ARod took him deep \xe2\x80\x93 very, very deep \xe2\x80\x93 and that is never a good thing. But perhaps Norris can build on this start and sharpen his control more for the next start.Chris Davis finally had a decent-looking line in a ballgame. He was 2-for-5 with a double and three RBIs. The runs batted in were crucial ones \xe2\x80\x93 the first in the game in the first inning, and a double to drive in a pair in the critical five-run sixth inning outburst that was the difference in the game. Davis still did strike out three times, but he was a factor in the win, and perhaps this too is something to build upon. (However, with 15 strikeouts, he is on pace to total 235 for the season.)Manny Machado has really struggled to get his hits in the early season. He has squared up some balls with little result, but it was good to see him get a solo home run tonight for his first round-tripper of the season. He walked once as well and looked really good running the bases. Machado is the least of the veterans that I\xe2\x80\x99m really worried about.Delmon Young came into this ninth game of the season only .231 on 3-for-13. But he did what he does best \xe2\x80\x93 pinch hitting and getting a base hit to score the go-ahead run in the sixth inning. And he added another hit later. He\xe2\x80\x99s fine.Brad Brach has had some rough outings in the early going. But on this night he was great in two innings \xe2\x80\x93 giving up only an isolated walk while recording the victory. In postgame remarks, Showalter said of him\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cI thought one of the key outings was Brad Brach, especially after sitting around for quite a while and going back out and being sharp again. Brad pitched real well for us the last third of the season and we could really use him to be that same contributor.\xe2\x80\x9dAdam Jones was only 1-for-4 in the game, although his line drive at the shortstop that he hit off the first pitch of Dellin Betances might have been the single hardest-hit ball of the game. And a great defensive play of \xe2\x80\x9crunning down\xe2\x80\x9d a ball over his head was great.

The Baltimore Orioles shortstop was expected to begin a rehab assignment on Friday, but that will no longer be the case because Hardy will not be ready, according to Dan Connolly of The Baltimore Sun.Hardy was penciled in for a rehab stint with Double-A Bowie, along with third baseman Jimmy Paredes, but after taking batting practice on Wednesday, Hardy took a day off on Thursday. Paredes will still make the trip to Bowie on Friday, then head to Triple-A Norfolk on Saturday, that also comes from The Sun.This news can be taken one of two ways: 1.) That swinging the bat on Wednesday set Hardy back. This could mean that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t recovering at the pace the Orioles had hoped. 2.) Hardy is coming along in his swinging program, and is merely taking a day off, like he might if he was still in spring training and conditioning himself for the regular season.For now, it would only be responsible to believe the latter. There has been no indication that there is anything wrong with Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and it would be wrong to start jumping to conclusions about what might be nothing more than a day off.Looking forward, the Orioles need Hardy to be 100% if they have any hopes of a big season and going deep into the playoffs.

Until then, the Orioles won\'t have to reset their watches or buckle up for a lengthy plane trip.The last teams to play all their games in the Eastern time zone through May were the 1932 Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Philadelphia Athletics and Washington Senators, according to STATS LLC.Back in those days, the train was the preferred mode of travel.""I wish we were doing it,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""I love the train.""Baltimore occasionally travels by rail to New York, but the schedule calls for a six-day stay in the Big Apple next month for games against the Mets and Yankees. So the Orioles will go by plane to New York, Boston, Toronto and Miami.""It wouldn\'t be feasible unless they get those bullet trains they have in Japan,"" reliever Darren O\'Day said. ""Now that would be cool.""Still, Baltimore couldn\'t ask for a better way to start the season. The Orioles play 30 games at home in April and May, and their 19-game road slate began with three against Tampa Bay \xe2\x80\x94 meaning they never left Florida from spring training.""Anytime you start the season you\'re trying to find your groove,"" first baseman Chris Davis said. ""So anything you can have in your favor to make the travel a little less strenuous is an advantage.""Showalter agreed that teams benefit from staying in the same time zone.""It takes you about two weeks to get acclimated to the new baseball clock,"" he said, ""so to not have that distraction is good.""The rest of the teams in the AL East might cry foul, but the favorable schedule was just a quirk of fate.""It really wasn\'t anything that was planned,"" said Katy Feeney, MLB\'s senior vice president of scheduling and club relations.Most teams face clubs within their division for the first three weeks, and the AL East matches up with the NL East in interleague play this year. When the Orioles meet three AL West teams in May, all three series are at Camden Yards.Their farthest trek before the end of May is to Miami.""The hardest part about the beginning of the season is the night game and then flying to a different city in a different time zone and having a day game the next day,"" Davis said.Orioles traveling secretary Kevin Buck is responsible for making the trip from one city to the next as easy as possible for the players. For these two months, that won\'t be a difficult task.""The biggest difference is the players are able to stay in a rhythm by staying in the same time zone,"" Buck said. ""There\'s no jet lag, no four or five-hour flight.""That\'s the case in April and May, anyway.""It\'s awesome,"" O\'Day said. ""Makes me wonder where we are in June, July and August.""June and July will bring visits to Houston, Chicago, Minnesota and Detroit. Then comes August, which features a nine-game trip to the West Coast, along with three-game series in both Kansas City and Texas.Challenge accepted.""The fans don\'t care about what time the game is.

That shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been enough reason for Jimenez to hit Sandoval intentionally, but it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting since there is seemingly no other reason for Jimenez to have hit Sandoval.8:19 PM: Snider and Jones each singled to start the fourth inning, putting runners on the corners with nobody out for Davis.

04/18/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Ubaldo Jimenez Beanball in Beantown', 'Apr 17, 2015; Boston, MA, USA; Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter (26) argues with home plate umpire Jordan Baker after starting pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez (not pictured) was ejected for throwing at a batter during the fourth inning against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. Mandatory Credit: Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY SportsI guess that Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez has been so good at the end of spring training and in his first game that his reputation has suddenly changed to being a pinpoint placement pitcher. So, if he comes up and in on a batter, clearly such a highly-refined command pitcher must be intentionally throwing at the hitter! Apparently that is the view of home plate umpire Jordan Baker, as he threw Jimenez out of the game after hitting Pablo Sandoval in the fourth inning Friday night in Boston.As an older writer who is in his sixth decade of watching thousands of baseball games, I have often about how horrible is the current state of umpiring in MLB. Replays two and three decades ago seldom revealed the ump to be wrong, and there was a strike zone that was relatively consistent from night to night.But this was one of the most amazing and egregious calls I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever witnessed. There was nothing to precipitate it, other than Sandoval\xe2\x80\x99s hard slide into second base earlier \xe2\x80\x93 a slide that any ballplayer would view as a legitimate part of the game.Perhaps it will come to the surface that what instigated the event was a beanball war in Tampa on Thursday between the Rays and Jays (with 4 HBPs). Word of that sort of thing gets around, and umpires are informed of such with directives to take command and not let these battles get out of control.In any event, this umpire changed the game, changed the series, changed the road trip, and who knows what else as the dominoes fall relative to relief pitching. We actually may, in time, look back at the Red Sox winning this game 3-2 with a crappy hit in the bottom of the ninth as a moment of good fortune. Going into a pile of extra innings, even if the O\xe2\x80\x99s won the game, might have caused more damage than the lousy ump already has.Jimenez now has pitched 10.2 innings with only one hit allowed, as he had given up none when tossed from the game. However, he had yielded three walks before plunking Sandoval and was pitching from behind in the count too much. But nobody is hitting much off him at all. It will be interesting to see where the rest of the season takes him.Though Orioles fans might feel that the umpire stole a win away from the O\xe2\x80\x99s, honestly the Birds need to score more than two runs. The umpire did not cause that to happen.Up until Brian Matusz walked a leadoff hitter in the 9th inning and wild-pitched him to second from which he would score on the Xander Bogaerts blooper off Tommy Hunter, the only runs by the Red Sox were on a two-run shot by Ryan Hanigan off Kevin Gausman. Boston tallied only four hits on the evening.What is the story right now with Orioles pitching, especially the bullpen? Altogether the O\xe2\x80\x99s pitching allowed seven walks on the evening. That is just unacceptable. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day was the only truly effective reliever.The bullpen has now allowed a score in all 10 of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 games so far. That is totally out of character. History would seem to indicate that this is not a trend that will continue. We must say that it is a surprise to see, in that the pen has been the most consistent segment of the team over the past three winning seasons.

He has had some successes in that role in the past, but they have come at portions of the season where his previous work was as a starter. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to this. Could he be slotted into the rotation if Bud Norris continues to flounder?In light of the pitching struggles and the short outing by Jimenez, could the Orioles possibly address the problem by going with an even shorter bench? Could they send down Flaherty and bring up a pitcher, and then replace that pitcher in a week or so with J.J. Hardy coming back? That is probably a pretty \xe2\x80\x9cout there\xe2\x80\x9d scenario, but another short outing this weekend or a long extra-innings game might demand such a bold move.Next: Checking the early season numbers for the Orioles ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Strange Moments during Win over Red Sox', ""Apr 18, 2015; Boston, MA, USA; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Steve Pearce (28) makes a diving catch on Boston Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts (2) during the fifth inning at Fenway Park. Mandatory Credit: Winslow Townson-USA TODAY SportsSaturday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-1 win of the Baltimore Orioles over the Boston Red Sox was one of those games filled with a lot of odd moments and unusual circumstances. Both teams allowed a lot of runners in scoring position to be left on base. The Orioles were 3-for-9 in RISP situations (with 10 left on base), while the Sox 0-for-9 (7 LOB).Bullpen Saves the Day \xe2\x80\x93 This was the first Orioles game of the season where the bullpen did not give up a run. Chris Tillman put up 5.1 innings of hard work, suffered through dozens of foul balls, and endured a squeezed strike zone at the end. Brad Brach looked the best he has this year in 1.2 innings, O\xe2\x80\x99Day had a great double-play ball help him through the 8th, and Zach Britton did what he does best \xe2\x80\x93 1,2,3.Davis Earns another Day in the Three Hole \xe2\x80\x93 After three more strikeouts (along with a single), I was thinking that Davis simply has to be dropped down the order until he gets something figured out. The encouraging thing, however, was that the Sox were insisting on pitching him outside rather than busting him up and in. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather see this. It allows him to extend, and he extended a 9th-inning two-run homer over the green wall. Nothing could help this team more than Chris Davis getting it together. Ever hear anybody else make that analysis?Scary \xe2\x80\x93 I caught the first inning on the car radio before getting home to see the rest of the game. Tillman threw a high and tight pitch, called as such by the announcer who suddenly yelled, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s been thrown out of the game! \xe2\x80\xa6 no, just kidding.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Geez, I had to put my heart back inside my body. It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so believable.Big Papi Speed \xe2\x80\x93 Is there a slower runner in baseball than David Ortiz? Anyone name Molina, I suppose. Certainly Cecil Fielder\xe2\x80\xa6 but that\xe2\x80\x99s about it! In fact, in a Bleacher Report article on the slowest players in baseball history, Papi ranked #12 (Fielder was #2).Add to this the fact that practically NOBODY even tries to steal against Chris Tillman. Runners are 2-for-13 over two years! That is a crazy statistic.So, in the bottom of the fourth inning, with the shift on against Pablo Sandoval, the big guy takes off for third base, and he made it \xe2\x80\x93 because Sandoval grounded out to first. It would have been interesting to see what would have happened. He and Manny Machado had a big laugh about it at third base.Actually, Ortiz scored the only Boston run, racing in from third base on a 50-foot infield grounder muffed by Tillman. Weird.Ryan Flaherty Gets Base Hits! \xe2\x80\x93 Unbelievable. He got two hits off Clay Buchholz, though he did strike out and leave the bases loaded in the 5th inning \xe2\x80\x93 not the only Oriole to leave ducks on the pond. In his final at-bat, he drilled a very hard liner to right field. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be playing more, now that Jonathan Schoop is on the disabled list. And if Scott Coolbaugh can make even a marginal hitter of Flaherty, I say sign the guy to a doubled salary \xe2\x80\x93 Coolbaugh, that is.

It was on display with two fine plays by De Aza in left field and a great diving catch by Steve Pearce. But Hanley Ramirez looks as lost in left field as anyone you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen in front of the Green Monster. Drifting back against it, he blew what should have been a catch. On Friday night he total misjudged caroms off the wall.

Good win!Next: Ubaldo's new reputation as a control specialist - apparently!\xc2\xa0 "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), (""Baltimore Orioles: Fans don't pay to see the umps"", 'Fans love using #umpshow on twitter whenever an umpire appears to get out of control during a game. We saw it from the faithful of the Baltimore Orioles last night in the immediate aftermath of Ubaldo Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s ejection at the hands of umpire Jordan Baker. The goal of every umpire\xc2\xa0should be to remain unknown to fans. Baker seemingly ensured that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen last night.I would submit that you know that an umpire has gone too far or is out of control when nobody seems to be stepping up to defend him \xe2\x80\x93 except his fellow umpires of course. Eduardo Encina of the\xc2\xa0Baltimore Sun reported that crew chief Jerry Meals said the following to a pool reporter after last night\xe2\x80\x99s game:\xc2\xa0More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

And then Pablo\xe2\x80\x99s next at-bat, first pitch to him [is a] fastball in. It\xe2\x80\x99s close to the head, it was a dangerous pitch, so it\xe2\x80\x99s an automatic. You can give a warning if you prefer to, but he felt it\xe2\x80\x99s an ejection.Read between the lines of that comment \xe2\x80\x93 no umpire (least of all a crew chief) is going to throw another under the bus, nor would I expect them to do so. However Meals said that Baker\xc2\xa0felt\xc2\xa0that it was an ejection. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t emphatically say that he agreed with the decision.Another cause for concern in this is what Meals said at the beginning of the statement above. Fenway Park showed the replay on their Diamondvision of Sandoval\xe2\x80\x99s takeout slide, and he then apparently observed the reaction in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout. So\xe2\x80\xa6umpires are now gauging team reactions and applying that to ejecting someone after a hit batsman without any warning or prior indication of trouble coming down the pike?The side of me that has a minor in American Government says that sounds an awful lot like convicting someone on circumstantial evidence based on the fact that they showed no emotion in the courtroom. As I said above, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear anyone coming out and saying that Baker made the right move by throwing Jimenez out of the game. Heck, Buck Showalter was pretty angry even after the game; he rarely calls out umpires in his postgame presser.In fairness, Baker is a young umpire at 32 \xe2\x80\x93 two years younger than I. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that he was trying to influence the game, and I certainly am not going to suggest that there was any sort of conspiracy or \xe2\x80\x9cfix\xe2\x80\x9d in against the Orioles. I\xe2\x80\x99m steadfast in my belief that most refs or umpires aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing things like that for the wrong reason. I think that Baker just acted on impulse, and unfortunately he thus became \xe2\x80\x9cthe story.\xe2\x80\x9dBut it can\xe2\x80\x99t be overstated that this has implications beyond just that moment in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game. It caused Kevin Gausman to get warmed up in a hurry. While he got out of that inning, he gave up a two-run homer in the fifth. Is it not possible that having to rush his warm-up might not have added to him missing his spot? Furthermore, the Orioles had to use their bullpen for much longer than anticipated yesterday \xe2\x80\x93 which obviously could impact today\xe2\x80\x99s game and the next few.Courtesy of Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY SportsAnd yes, this is all because Jordan Baker over-reacted and ejected a pitcher for no apparent reason. Perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s forgivable in the context that Baker is a young umpire and at some point he\xe2\x80\x99ll learn when to throw someone out and when not to. But his \xe2\x80\x9cyouthful indiscretion\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help the Orioles, who are thinking that every game\xe2\x80\x99s going to count big time in this year\xe2\x80\x99s AL East.Incidentally, I believe that all sports do the routine where pool reporters are sent into the umpires/referees\xe2\x80\x99 locker room afterwards to take any statements the crew might have. To my knowledge, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t required to say anything. However I agree with the legendary former Georgetown University basketball coach, John Thompson Jr. Granted he was talking about college basketball players, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a very true thing to say that if 18-year old kids\xc2\xa0[insert professional baseball players] are required to speak to the media, it\xe2\x80\x99s not unreasonable for the refs/umps to have to do the same.It\xe2\x80\x99s also telling to me that Jerry Meals, a decent umpire and a veteran at that, spoke on behalf of the crew. Granted he\xe2\x80\x99s the crew chief, but it appeared that he wanted to be the voice of the group as oppposed to allowing Baker to speak for himself.As I said, the goal of any umpire is to be unseen throughout the game. And I would submit that while bad calls are rampant in all sports, for the most part they do a very good job of this. However Jordan Baker failed at that last night, and he failed miserably. He should take a few cues from Jim Joyce, who famously cost a Detroit pitcher a perfect game with a bad call in the ninth inning a few years ago. Afterwards after seeing the replay, Joyce tearfully admitted that he blew the call and \xe2\x80\x9ccost that kid a perfect game.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a very public apology, and it was well-received by fans.I suspect that after he gets some mileage under him, Baker will look back on this and know he made a mistake. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help the Orioles right now, for as they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do anything they can to win, they fell victim to an #umpshow last night.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe loss of Jonathan Schoop to a knee injury is simply not good news at all for the Baltimore Orioles. There is a void that will be difficult to fill. This is especially true with J.J. Hardy still out for the foreseeable future. So far, that loss has not been too terribly felt with the reasonably solid play of Everth Cabrera. But it is asking a lot to fill in both middle infield positions.Simply looking at the defensive side of the game, though Ryan Flaherty can likely field as well, he does not have the same arm for turning double plays in clutch situations (not to say that Flaherty is not an above-average defender).On the offensive side, the addition of Jimmy Paredes would appear to be a very effective replacement, but that would be giving up a great deal in the field. If you could have Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s defense and Paredes\xe2\x80\x99 offense in one player, you\xe2\x80\x99d really have something.Will Paredes continue the offensive production we saw in spring training? The optimist says \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d because he came right back to the team and was 2-for-5 with a run scored in his first game. The pessimist says \xe2\x80\x9cnot likely in the long term, or else he would have done it somewhere else before this time.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Both are imaginable, and I suspect we will see a rotation of the three players mentioned here to cover the two middle infield positions.But what if the Orioles need to go deeper into the organization at some point? And how long will Schoop be out?Regarding the second question, there seems to be mixed signals from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 camp. And maybe it is simply too early to say with any confidence. There are the remarks about him simply \xe2\x80\x9crehabbing in Sarasota,\xe2\x80\x9d beginning in a few days. That does not sound so bad. But with Buck saying something about hoping to have him back yet this season; that sounded troublesome.

The early numbers and not good. Janish is 6-for-34 (.176), while Nix is 7-for-36 (.194). At AA Bowie, Derrik Gibson is 9-for-39 at second base, while Ozzie Martinez is 8-for-39 at shortstop (.205). There is also Rey Navarro, who is on the DL as well.Looking at the immediate options in the high minors, the Orioles had better hope that Cabrerra, Flaherty and Paredes can make it work sufficiently until J.J. Hardy can join actively.It is truly a shame to see this situation befall Jonathan Schoop. Like Matt Wieters a year ago, he was off to a great start and looking like the player he was advertised to be. He was 7-for-27 with three home runs and seven RBIs.Between Schoop and Manny Machado, crossing first base successfully appears to be one of the larger risks in baseball. I believe there really is something to be said for the first base bag such as is in some softball leagues \xe2\x80\x93 with a double bag, part in fair territory and partly in foul ground.

Though he also erased himself from the bases two of those times, once by getting caught stealing and the other time by getting picked off 1B.    Frederick 3 Wilmington (Royals) 4 I really wanted to go this game but lingering flu symptoms has wrecked me the past few days. ugh. Anyways, 24 year old lefty Matt Taylor made his \'15 debut, and allowed 2 ER over 4 innings of work. Austin Urban allowed 2 ERs in the 6th, giving the Blue Rocks a lead they would hold onto. Happy days for Mr. Celery. Following his 4 for 4 performance yesterday, Drew Dosch went 2 for 3 with a walk, a double, and all 3 Keys\' runs driven in. The rest of the offense combined for 3 hits, 2 walks, and 9 Ks. \'Nuff said. Delmarva 2 Greensboro (Marlins) 3 Obviously inspired by the recent Star Wars trailer, Sebastian Vader had a good outing, holding the Grasshoppers to 1 ER via 5 hits and 1 walk over 6 innings. Derrick Bleeker came on in the 7th and eventually struck out the side while allowing a couple of singles in the process. In the 8th however he would get tagged with a 2-run dinger after allowing a lead off single, giving Greensboro a late lead. On offense, catching tandem Alex Murphy and Jonah Heim each had 2 for 4 nights. Though the latter would get thrown out at Home after a Ronarsy Ledesma single to LF.

They\xe2\x80\x99re going to pitch me because of the way they have seen me hit.\xe2\x80\x9d Jones raised his average to .457 with five homers and 16 RBIs, and also equaled his career best with the four hits. \xe2\x80\x9cRight now they\xe2\x80\x99ve probably got the hottest hitter in all of baseball going for them, in Jones, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to slow them down,\xe2\x80\x9d Boston manager John Farrell said. Ryan Flaherty added a solo homer and Jimmy Paredes three singles for the Orioles, who won for the second straight day after losing the series opener.

04/20/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Ryan Flaherty \\u2013 At Home in Boston', 'Apr 19, 2015; Boston, MA, USA; Baltimore Orioles third baseman Ryan Flaherty (3) is greeted at the dugout by manager Buck Showalter (26) after his solo home run against the Boston Red Sox during the second inning at Fenway Park. Mandatory Credit: Winslow Townson-USA TODAY SportsThe sport of baseball and the players who play it occasionally display anomalies that stand out as very unusual. At the same time, the game is generally one where, over time, there is an averaging-out of most statistics that do not have a logical foundation.When listening to Baltimore Orioles broadcasts this weekend of games being played against the Red Sox at Fenway Park in Boston, it has been duly noted that second baseman Ryan Flaherty hits particularly well in this stadium. As a bit of a Flaherty skeptic, I am almost tempted to say that if someone only ever hits well in one ballpark, then yes, it does stand out and gets mentioned.Flaherty \xe2\x80\x93 the Rule 5 draftee in 2012 who has stuck with the team now for year #4 \xe2\x80\x93 still does not have a significantly large number of games and at-bats in his career to make many definitive statements (apart from concluding that he looks like a .220-something hitter?). And though the sample size is not huge, his extraordinary numbers at Fenway compared to everywhere else really do stick out as an \xe2\x80\x9canomaly.\xe2\x80\x9dHere they are, compared to everywhere else (at least 20 at-bats) \xe2\x80\xa6Fenway Park, Boston \xe2\x80\x93 22-for-57 = .386Yankee Stadium, New York \xe2\x80\x93 10-for-37 = .270Progressive Field, Cleveland \xe2\x80\x93 6-for-26 = .240Angel Stadium, Anaheim \xe2\x80\x93 5-for-22 = .227Oriole Park, Baltimore \xe2\x80\x93 82-for-365 = .225Safeco Field, Seattle \xe2\x80\x93 6-for-24 = .167 Rogers Center, Toronto \xe2\x80\x93 6-for-36 = .167 Tropicana Field, Tampa Bay \xe2\x80\x93 7-for-52 = .135Everywhere else combined \xe2\x80\x93 14-for-83 = .169So when you look at this list, there really is only one thing that stands out. For some reason he hits extraordinarily well at Fenway Park. The only explanation that I can figure as a possible reason is that he is close enough to home in Maine that his mom cooks for him while he is there.Seriously, growing up in a baseball family in New England (his dad is a college coach), one is a fan of the Red Sox and goes to games at Fenway Park. So these walls are really, truly home for Flaherty. The environment is totally familiar, chowder and all. That has to be it!Actually, his game-tying home run on Sunday was the first of his career at Fenway. Flaherty has now hit 25 career homers, 16 of them at home in Camden Yards.Without a doubt, now that Jonathon Schoop is out of the lineup for some extended period of time, Flaherty is going to be playing more. I have no grievance whatsoever with his defensive abilities; he has great value as a utility infielder. It is his lack of plate production that makes one wonder if there is not some other possibility to provide more punch in the lineup.

Most of the time, the big looping swing is now replaced with a more compact and quick swing. This could make a difference. He is swinging through less pitches.And I am beginning to believe I see the evidence in Flaherty (and a few others) that the Orioles may have definitely upgraded their hitting instruction. If so, Coolbaugh could prove to have been the best offseason improvement and addition to the Baltimore Orioles.

New England native Ryan Flaherty hit a line drive homer to center field with two outs one inning later, and suddenly we were tied at three. And that in and of itself really shows you that this is a very typical Buck Showalter-coached Oriole team. They don\xe2\x80\x99t let an in-game setback get them down, they never say die, and they play until the final out.The O\xe2\x80\x99s loaded the bases in the fifth with Travis Snider coming to the plate, and Snider didn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint. His infield RBI-single gave the Birds a 4-3 lead, a margin that went up to 5-3 a moment later following Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x98s sac fly-RBI.

However the defending champions certainly sent a message to the rest of the division by taking two of the first three games in Boston\xe2\x80\x99s yard. I felt that Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s victory was a \xe2\x80\x9cteam win,\xe2\x80\x9d and this one was as well. Under Showalter the O\xe2\x80\x99s have always been a\xc2\xa0sum of the parts team, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve shown that and then some this weekend.This was also the second consecutive game in which the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen hasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed a run, a fact of which reliever Tommy Hunter reminded MASNsports\xe2\x80\x99 Roch Kubatko after the game:Two games in a row, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll hopefully keep that streak going and not go back to the other \xe2\x80\xa6 It was nine games in a row, I guess, or 10? Oh, 10 games. So, yeah, glad I could contribute and Gausman could contribute and we could play baseball. So much fun.While we\xe2\x80\x99re only two weeks into the season, it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to argue that Adam Jones isn\xe2\x80\x99t playing at a pace worthy of MVP consideration. Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a very small sample size of games. However Jones is hitting .457 on the year, going 4-for-5 yesterday with five RBI including a two-run homer.For the second consecutive year, the Orioles will play the visitor in Boston\xe2\x80\x99s traditional Patriot\xe2\x80\x99s Day game. It\xe2\x80\x99s a big day in the city of Boston, with the O\xe2\x80\x99s and BoSox playing at 11 AM at Fenway, and of course the Boston Marathon.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a short week, but on the other end it almost feels like an extra bye week. In this case while it\xe2\x80\x99s a quick turnaround from yesterday to today, on the flip side it almost ends up feeling like an extra day off. Omlettes, anyone?!

Mora, Roenicke and Uhlman will be honored at a luncheon and in an on-field ceremony prior to the August 14 game against the Oakland Athletics. Lowenstein will be unable to attend due to a previous engagement. The luncheon at Oriole Park will be sponsored by Oriole Advocates who founded the Orioles Hall of Fame. Melvin Mora played nine seasons with the Orioles from 2000-2009 and played in 808 games at third base which is second on the club\xe2\x80\x99s all-time list to Brooks Robinson. Mora is among the franchise leaders in doubles (8th, 252), RBI (8th, 662), home runs (10th, 158), runs (10th, 709), total bases (10th, 2,073), hits (11th, 1,323), walks (11th, 465), games played (12th, 1,256), and at-bats (12th, 4,733). The Orioles acquired Mora from the Mets in July of 2000. In his first 4 seasons, he played 6 different positions before settling in to third base in 2004. In 2004, he set the Orioles single-season record with a .340 batting average, while posting career-highs in home runs with 27 and RBIs with 104. Mora was a two-time All-Star, a Silver Slugger Award winner and a two-time AL Player of the Month. The left field platoon duo of left-handed hitting Lowenstein and right-handed hitting Roenicke played under manager Earl Weaver from 1979-1985. They combined for 171 home runs and registered 574 RBIs in 7 seasons. They helped the 1979 Orioles win the American League pennant. In 1982, the duo combined for 45 homers and 140 RBIs but fell just a game shy of another AL East title but the following year they combined for 34 home runs and 124 RBI in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 third World Series championship season. Uhlman spent 46 years in professional scouting including three decades with the Orioles before retiring earlier this year.

Mandatory Credit: Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY SportsIt has to feel good for the Baltimore Orioles to be flying out of Boston, even if they are doing so after a 7-1 rain-shortened loss to the Red Sox. April baseball at Fenway can be a bit of a difficult weather experience, and it was indeed that over the past three days. I have loved visiting Boston several times in my life in the summer months, but for the life of me I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why anyone would actually want to live there year-round.So the Orioles leave town with a series split, 2-2. To that I say, \xe2\x80\x9cGood enough.\xe2\x80\x9d The Red Sox are an improved team over 2014 \xe2\x80\xa6 not exactly outright scary however. But they were averaging 6.2 runs a game coming into the series, and the Orioles held them to seven runs in the first game, while the first five Boston runs on Monday were unearned.Beyond this, again, it is the early season with the crappy weather. This affects the pitchers and their grip and feel for the baseball.So, four Boston games are complete. Prior to Monday, the Orioles had outscored the Sox 46-24 in the last eight games at Fenway, winning seven of them. Losing a crappy game on a crappy day at a crappy time of the day is no big deal. Move on; they will. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are good at that. Maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll get some better umpires at the next stop.Actually, the rains helped the Orioles. It was unlikely the Birds were going to come back from a 7-1 deficit after 6 innings, so the rains kept the bullpen from having to cover a couple of more innings in a probable losing cause.Just move on. Probably only Ryan Flaherty is sad to leave Boston. He did it again \xe2\x80\x93 knocked in the lone Orioles run with a double off the Green Monster. And he was 2-for-3 on the day \xe2\x80\x93 that is half of the O\xe2\x80\x99s hits. This raises his Fenway average to .400 on 24-for-60 in his career; and his season average is now .333.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll believe he\xe2\x80\x99s a new guy when he does the same at the Rogers Center in Toronto, where he is a career 6-for-36. Just writing that and publishing it for the world to see does significantly raise the chances it could happen \xe2\x80\xa6 just sayin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 always contributing to the O\xe2\x80\x99s cause. You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome!So, yes, on to Toronto and the friends there. The Orioles were 11-8 against the Jays last year, 5-4 in Toronto and 6-4 in Baltimore. They outscored the Jays 74-70.

Probably the key to the game is how well Norris will perform.Next: Flaherty loves hitting in Boston ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles play dumb, lose big to Jays 13-6 - Camden Chat', "" The Orioles lost big the to Blue Jays tonight 13-6 as Bud Norris continues his early season struggles. The game began auspiciously enough for Norris who cruised through the first inning without allowing a base runner.    Then came the second inning which started with a lead off home run from Edwin Encarnacion. Then came a double and an error to move the runner to third base, a walk, and another walk to load the bases. The nine hitter Ryan Goins stood in and singled to right field scoring two runs and the runners advanced on an overthrow from Travis Snider. Next, Jose Reyes hit a ground ball to the shortstop and the throw came home. However, Caleb Joseph missed the tag, which was upheld on review, 4-0 Jays. Next, Joseph attempted to catch Reyes stealing, but his throw tailed into the runner and trickled into center fielder. The runner on third scored, 5-0. Finally, Josh Donaldson doubled off of the wall to score Reyes, 6-0. Norris was able to get Jose Bautista and Encarnaicion to fly out to end the inning as the Jays batted around and scored six runs. The bad pitching and mediocre defense would continue all night. The Jays would add three more runs off of Norris in the 3rd. Kevin Pillar had the big single which scored two runs off of Norris. Brian Matusz replaced Norris and promptly gave up another single to Ryan Goins which scored another run, 9-2 Jays. That ended Bud's night at 2.1 innings pitched, 6 hits, 9 earned runs, 3 walks, 2 strike outs, and 1 home run. The game went much better for Jays starter Mark Buehrle. He recorded clean innings in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th innings. The only real damage the Orioles did was in the second inning which included a run scoring double by Ryan Flaherty and a Steve Pearce RBI ground out to make it 6-2 at the time. The mini comeback was immediately erased by Bud Norris' terrible 3rd inning.    The 5th inning meant more runs for the Jays. Brian Matusz still on the mound and forced into long man duty gave up a double, a single, and a sac fly to make it 10-2. The Orioles came back in the top of the 6th to add one more run on a Manny Machado sac fly to make it 10-3, but the Orioles could not put together a big enough rally to ever make the game truly competitive.    The bottom of the sixth inning began with another Encarnacion home run that was absolutely devastated to the 5th deck of the Rogers Centre, 11-3. Delmon Young did not even turn around to look at the ball, although that might have been Delmon not noticing the ball was hit in his general direction per the usual. Matusz, after giving up two more hits, gave way to Jason Garcia who closed out the inning without allowing anymore runs. The top of the 7th brought a little more life from the Orioles after a lead off walk and single. An error allowed a runner to score, 11-4, and with runners on 2nd and 3rd with one out Adam Jones lined a ball to center field. However, Kevin Pillar caught the sinking line drive on an incredible dive. Then he popped up and threw out Chris Davis at second base, double play, inning over with no more runs.    After early overthrows and errors, the bottom of the 7th inning brought even more stupidity out. After a Josh Donaldson double, Jose Bautista stood at the plate against Jason Garcia. Garcia uncorked a fastball that went behind Bautista's back. A most likely unintentional mistake by a 22 year old pitcher who had already hit a guy today and hit one yesterday. Nonetheless, throwing behind a guy is never taken lightly and Bautista has been know to be a bit sensitive about things such as these. Two pitches later he clobbered a home run to left center field. He took his sweet time getting out of the box waiting for Garcia to turn around so Bautisa could flip his bat in Garcia's face. Then, in succession, Steve Pearce, Ryan Flaherty, and Adam Jones all took their turns berating Bautista for showing up their young pitcher. It seemingly irked Jones the most of all as he continued yelling at Bautista the rest of the inning and on the way into the dugout. This will most likely not be the end of this garbage for the rest of the series and probably the rest of this season. Only in baseball do you react like a child for having your masculinity challenged. The rest of the game went on without much interest, the Orioles added two more runs in the top of the 8th inning on a RBI ground out by Machado and Travis Snider scoring on a wild pitch. Otherwise, Brad Brach closed the game out for the Orioles as David Lough came in to replace Adam Jones most likely to protect him from himself and from the Blue Jays. Did that recap make you feel any better? I asked Mark if I could just post pictures of my dog, he didn't go for it. Anyways, the Orioles look to rebound tomorrow night at 7:05pm with Ubaldo Jimenez on the mound to face off against Aaron Sanchez. Hopefully, it'll be less dumb.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The Blue Jays won 13-6. Mandatory Credit: Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY SportsBirds of a feather flock together. And there is no flocking going on right now between the Baltimore Orioles and the Toronto Blue Jays. In the real world of birds, blue jays as a species are the ornithological version of a cross between the town bully and village idiot.The Orioles were indeed mugged by the Jays on Tuesday night 13-6, and frankly, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as close as that score would seem to indicate. It was one of the poorest games I\xe2\x80\x99ve witnessed the Orioles play since the infamous days of the Dave Trembley era. Buck Showalter said in his postgame interview on MASN \xe2\x80\xa6We didn\xe2\x80\x99t play very well in a lot of areas of the game \xe2\x80\xa6 We did a lot of things wrong that we normally do right, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy about that. As the game was progressing, I was thinking about how totally annoyed the O\xe2\x80\x99s manager must have been with what he was seeing. The Orioles were making poor plays in the field, bad reads on balls in the air, missing cutoff men and allowing extra bases, and throwing the ball around like a beer league softball game. At the same time it must be said that Toronto was hitting the ball well.However, this O\xe2\x80\x99s team is one that is going to score runs most nights. If they can get some pitching, not be crazy on defense, and simply keep hanging around, they have a chance to get themselves back into a game where they\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed some early runs by the other team.Even so, no team can survive a starter giving up nine earned runs in 2.1 innings and hope to win a game. And that is what Bud Norris did on yet another night when his command iss missing, too many pitches are up in the zone, and even with decent velocity there is no late movement. He was shelled from both the top and bottom of the lineup. Norris is fooling nobody right now.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Another two or three starts?But the flying feathers of this orange and blue bird fight came particularly from Jose Bautista. When rookie Jason Garcia threw a ball behind him, he gave the \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d glare at the 22-year-old. Unless Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day is paying off Garcia to throw at Bautista, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is any chance at all that there is intent.Of course, as would happen, Bautista immediately sends a homer over the center field wall, admires his shot, flips his bat, and displays a blue jay-like Blue Jays attitude with a slow trot around the bases. It did not sit well with the alpha oriole Adam Jones. It took little lip-reading ability to see that Jones was yelling, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s bull poop, and you know it!\xe2\x80\x9dSo there is some bad bird blood between these teams, and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even mentioned the Manny Machado / Josh Donaldson disaffection. Then there is the offseason crap that happened with this organization. But I cannot say that I dislike this emotion and commotion. Bring it on; it is interesting and will add to the fun of seeing the O\xe2\x80\x99s defend their top perch from attack by the bullies and idiots.Fortunately the loss only counts as one loss, and the Orioles will go at it again on Wednesday night with Ubaldo Jimenez taking the hill. Wow, it must be a new year when we are looking at UJ as the current ace to settle down a pitching staff that is getting hit all over the field.Next: The great start of Adam Jones ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles rookie Garcia nearly hits Bautista before home run', 'Toronto Blue Jays\' Jose Bautista swings on a two-run home run off Baltimore Orioles\' Jason Garcia during the seventh inning of a baseball game Tuesday, April 21, 2015, in Toronto.

""It\'s not him in particular, but he\'s one of the game\'s best players and it\'s just sad that\'s the way he chooses to play the game.""Adam Jones was even more forthright, and defended his pitcher\'s actions as perfectly in keeping with those of a nervous 22-year-old just learning the ropes of major-league baseball.""Respect the game,"" the center fielder said. ""I know he does, but at that moment right there he didn\'t, and when it happens against my team I\'m going to take offence to it.""For his part, Bautista shrugged off the criticism of his actions after connecting on his fourth home run of the year.""I\'m an emotional player and I play with a lot of passion,"" he said. ""You throw at me, I\'m not going to forget and if I get you right after, I\'m going to enjoy it. And I did. I have no regrets about it.""The Blue Jays will have no regrets about how the game unfolded.The first of two Edwin Encarnacion home runs was a leadoff shot that landed on the batter\'s eye beyond center field and sparked a six-run second inning. Three more runs in the third were enough to chase Orioles starter Bud Norris (0-2) after just 2 1-3 innings, less than two weeks after getting yanked only three innings into Baltimore\'s home opener against the same Blue Jays.Encarnacion\'s second homer, for his fourth of the season, was a left-field blast into the top deck of Rogers Centre. It was just the 18th home run to climb that high in the 26-year history of the stadium.Toronto starter Mark Buehrle (3-0) went six innings to get his second win against the Orioles this year. Given the offensive support being provided to the left-hander so far this season - an average of 12 runs a game in his first two starts - his confidence is certainly peaking.""I\'m going to put my name up on the board tomorrow and tell them I\'m pitching and see if it works again,"" Buehrle joked. ""I wouldn\'t want to be the opposing pitcher when I\'m pitching.""Sitting on the other side of the fence, Norris was in a less jovial mood, particularly with two big losses against the Blue Jays in less than two weeks.""It\'s a combination of things,"" Norris said of his recent travails against Toronto. ""The mistakes I\'m making, they\'re not missing . I\'ve got to get back on the horse, keep competing and pitching the corners and because that\'s all I can do.""TURF TROUBLEThe newly laid artificial turf at Rogers Centre was back in the spotlight, as Orioles third baseman Jimmy Paredes was hit in the face during batting practice on a bad hop while fielding grounders. He was OK, but the turf has already been criticized this season for playing too slow, and Orioles manager Buck Showalter, seeing it for the first time cautioned, ""You\'ve got to be careful out there.""UP NEXTOrioles RH Ubaldo Jimenez (1-0) faces Blue Jays RH Aaron Sanchez (0-2) on Wednesday night. Over three career appearances at Toronto\'s Rogers Centre, including two starts, Jimenez has an earned-run average of 8.68.TRAINER\'S ROOMBlue Jays: Rookie second baseman Devon Travis sat out with sore ribs after being hit by a pitch on Sunday. Outfielder Michael Saunders, on a rehab assignment with Single-A Dunedin after knee surgery during spring training, will ""ideally"" join the team in Tampa this weekend, said manager John Gibbons. Starter Daniel Norris underwent an MRI on his pitching arm after suffering what he termed a ""dead-arm phase"" following his last start on Sunday. The test revealed he had nothing more serious than fatigue.Orioles: Shortstop J.J. Hardy, recovering from a left shoulder strain, is with Triple-A Norfolk and hit off a tee and took ground balls Tuesday, but there is no timetable for his return. According to Showalter, catcher Matt Wieters, who is rehabbing following Tommy John surgery, may catch two to three innings on Friday in Sarasota.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

The Toronto Blue Jays won 4-2. Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsIt would seem that the time has come for Baltimore Orioles Manager Buck Showalter to have a team rant, or at a minimum a Dutch uncle talk. After a third consecutive loss in style that is not known to be characteristic of the O\xe2\x80\x99s, there is a need for some measure of intervention.At the same time it is only 15 games into the season. And though 7-8 was not the target at this point, the Orioles are still only two games behind the Red Sox. A total of 147 games remain. The Orioles were 8-7 at this point last year. All is not lost.Speaking of 2014, it is the slow start with mediocre pitching of a year ago that gives Birds fans hope that once again a change is in the wind. I will say that I believe that. But some fear of negative trend lines is not unreasonable either.If \xe2\x80\x9cfresh eyes\xe2\x80\x9d was the phrase of a year ago, this year it is \xe2\x80\x9ctrack record.\xe2\x80\x9d Having coached that sport, I\xe2\x80\x99m all about track records and can spew them out as well as baseball statistics. But this is of course a metaphor for the historic performances of players. And indeed, that tends to be the baseline toward which either over-performing or under-performing players gravitate over time \xe2\x80\xa6 most of the time.But a team still has to win on the field, and that is not something the Orioles are doing here in recent days, dropping a 4-2 game to the Blue Jays on Wednesday night.Here are some of the reasons seen in the most recent outing that contributed to a loss \xe2\x80\xa6 ingredients seen in other recent games as well \xe2\x80\xa6Plate Discipline \xe2\x80\x93 Actually, it is the lack thereof that is seen too often. How does a team lose a low-scoring game when the opponent\xe2\x80\x99s starter walks seven batters in 5.1 innings? Beyond that, he departed the game only throwing 83 pitches, with 43 as strikes. It is possible because, in spite of those who worked counts and let themselves get on base, too many others were hacking away. Three Orioles hit a first pitch, three others hit a 1-0 pitch, and another hit a 2-0 pitch. So that is seven batters seeing only 12 pitches.And then when the Orioles have a shot at gaining some runs with the bases loaded and one out in the sixth inning, Ryan Flaherty swings at the first pitch he sees and pops out harmlessly. He must have thought he was still at Fenway. And the final outs of the game come on a first-pitch double play grounder by Delmon Young. In fact, the Orioles went from having runners at first and second with none out in the top of the ninth and a 2-2 count on the batter, to two pitches later ending the game via a strikeout and 6-4-3 play. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look now, but the Orioles lead the American League in grounding into double plays.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago(Additional added note \xe2\x80\x93 I saw this after publication on Roch Kubatko\xe2\x80\x99s blog and simply had to add it \xe2\x80\x93 is an incredible stat: \xe2\x80\x9cAccording to Sportsnet Stats, Aaron Sanchez is the first Blue Jays pitcher to walk at least seven batters and record a win since Jeff Ware on Sept. 8, 1995. Too much first-pitch hacking with runners on base. Too many runners stranded.\xe2\x80\x9d)Stupid Base Running \xe2\x80\x93 Alejandro De Aza. Wow. He ran the Orioles out of an inning by trying to steal third base with two outs and Chris Davis at the plate. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he was sure he would make it. Not a sure thing! It is so rare to see the Orioles do stupid things on the basepaths, except for this road trip.Striking Out \xe2\x80\x93 This is not an entirely new thing, nor is it the end-all of an offense \xe2\x80\xa6 better to strike out than hit into a double play. But the Orioles are second in the league in this category, though they have somehow offset that by being third in on base percentage. But speaking again of De Aza \xe2\x80\x93 the leadoff hitter \xe2\x80\x93 he now has 17 strikeouts and is on pace to record 184. That is the exact number of the highest strikeout total for a player in the American League last year (though to be fair, that player was Mike Trout!). But with Chris Davis on the team and Chris Carter of the Astros flailing away, he probably can finish no higher than third at the end! So be encouraged.At \xe2\x80\x98Em Balls (by Adam and others) \xe2\x80\x93 Again, in the category of hope, some of the Orioles are hitting very hard-hit line drives right at people.

Though the Birds pulled out two wins in Boston, they never seemed to really recover from the tossing of Jimenez in the first game.But there is more to blame than the pitchers who puts too many runners on base. Not to repeat yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s post that lamented these same themes, it is particularly grievous to see so many of the Orioles constantly throwing to the wrong base, missing cutoff men (who are often late to get into position), and simply not holding the base hit at first base.Trying to cut down lead runners will most often fail, and instead of maintaining the double play possibility, there now exists two runners in scoring position, or even a runner who scored.So the problems are elementary. A baseball team cannot succeed by freely putting men on base and then not containing their movement around the basepaths. With the Orioles coming back from a 7-0 deficit and scoring even four runs in the ninth inning, it illustrates how the Birds are never really out of a game. If only the pitching and defense can contain the expansion of early runs in the game, the offense has a shot at coming back.If Rick Dempsey is correct that nothing good follows a walk, then eight not good things (at least) follow eight walks! This pitching staff needs some fresh eyes to figure out where the strike zone is hiding.

Nobody was more overmatched than Chris Davis who struck out four times. The problem is deeper than the pitching. You can see it all over Davis\xe2\x80\x99 face and demeanor. Pitchers are able to jam him up and in, and they are simply blowing high fast balls past him. Will he figure out? Can he figure it out? It is no longer a \xe2\x80\x9ctrack record\xe2\x80\x9d from the past, but is rather becoming ancient history. I\xe2\x80\x99m not ready to throw him overboard just yet, but until he gets if figured out, he has got to be placed in the bottom third of the order. Even worse news is that Steve Pearce is in a 4-for-42 slump, also looking rather lost.Manny Machado is getting some return. Of course that line quotes a favorite \xe2\x80\x9cBuckism.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Manny has been squaring up some balls for some time and hitting them right at people. I would not be surprised if he does not take off from this point forward.Adam Jones has never looked better at the plate. In recent games it has been simply the greatest sight to see Jones slapping the outside pitches to right field and getting hits. If he takes away the low and outside pitch as an effective tool against him, Jones could indeed have a career year.The collection of middle infielders is paying off. It was a strange sight in the offseason to see Duquette collecting so many middle infielders. As much as he did it for depth in the event of injuries, he also did it to fill a vacuum of such in the upper levels of the farm system. It is now paying off. Ryan Flaherty will be joining J.J. Hardy and Jonathan Schoop on the disabled list, so that is the entire middle infield from 2014. Rey Navarro will be joining the team in Baltimore. If I told you last fall that the three middle infielders on the Orioles 25-man roster at the end of April would be Navarro, Jimmy Paredes and Everth Cabrerra, would you have believed it?There is no better time to turn things around than today and this weekend against the Red Sox.

After last night\xe2\x80\x99s 7-6 loss in Toronto, the Birds had to be ready to high-tail it out of Canada after being swept at the hands of a team that seemed bent on making sure the Orioles knew where they stood with each other. However if there\xe2\x80\x99s a silver lining,\xc2\xa0it would seemingly be that the Birds seemed to come to life late in the game \xe2\x80\x93 a trend that one hopes carries over into this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s series with Boston at home.Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x98s command was shaky from the start, causing Buck Showalter to resort to the bullpen much earlier than necessary once again. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.1 IP, 5 H, 7 R, 5 BB, 3 K. The walks were what did Tillman in, which is very uncharacteristic of him specifically. Now granted my personal opinion is that he threw more pitches in the strike zone than he got was credited with. But that\xe2\x80\x99s also a tough sell when you\xe2\x80\x99re command\xe2\x80\x99s off to begin with.\xc2\xa0More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

(Catcher Ryan Lavarnway was charged with a pass ball.) That may not sound like a feat, however when you aren\xe2\x80\x99t playing well you look at things like that.With Toronto already leading 1-0 after a FC-RBI (resulting from a lead off walk), Josh Donaldson smacked a two-run homer to give Toronto a 3-0 lead in the fourth. Kevin Pillar would add a two-RBI double, and Russel Martin an RBI-double of his own in the fifth. The Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t even able to register a hit until the sixth inning, which was when they broke up Toronto starter Drew Hutchinson\xe2\x80\x99s perfect game bid.But once that was taken care of, things started to happen for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. The perfecto was broken up on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x98s lead off, first-pitch home run in the top of the sixth. An inning later, Travis Snider grounded into a FC-RBI to cut Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s lead to 7-2. The Birds would get the first two runners on base in the top of the ninth, which brought Snider\xe2\x80\x99s spot to the plate once again. He delivered for a second time, with an RBI-single that scored Adam Jones.Courtesy of Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY SportsLater in that ninth inning Machado came to the plate once again, this time with one out and two runners on base. He picked a grand time to register his second homer of the game, this one of course of the three-run variety. That closed the gap to 7-6, making a previously comfortable lead for Toronto turn into a dog fight. However the Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to get any closer than that, and they were swept back to the US with a four game losing streak.Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to sugarcoat a three-game sweep. However if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for silver linings that ninth inning last night is certainly one. Even at a diminished strength due to injuries, these 2015 Birds still have that\xc2\xa0play \xe2\x80\x99till the last out gene that\xe2\x80\x99s common in Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s teams. While the result is still the same at 7-2 as opposed to 7-6, you never know what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.The Orioles have summoned infielder Rey Navarro to join them in Baltimore this weekend, in anticipation of Ryan Flaherty heading to the 15-day DL. Flaherty injured his groin running the bases on the Rogers Centre turf on the final out of Wednesday night\xe2\x80\x99s game. That turf has come under increased scrutiny through the opening weeks of the season, as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come off as having the best traction, and balls seem to die once they hit it. Now that someone might be destined for the DL as a result of it, perhaps Toronto will be forced to change it out.One of the big parts of any Duquette/Showalter team is depth, but the Orioles are now finding some of their depth (in Flaherty) joining their starters on the DL. You have to believe that once this team is back together and complete they\xe2\x80\x99ll start firing on more cylinders. The Birds are hoping that in the next couple of days J.J. Hardy can begin a rehab assignment, after taking 75 swings in the cage yesterday in Norfolk. Getting Hardy back in the near future will probably stablize the infiled and streamline the batting order just a bit.The O\xe2\x80\x99s open up a three-game weekend series with Boston tonight at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. This is the season\xe2\x80\x99s only weekend set in Baltimore between these two teams, which is an odd scheduling quirk. Miguel Gonzalez is taxed with being a stopper for the Orioles, who need to snap a four-game losing streak. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Rick Porcello.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Losses fortunately free of theatrics  ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

One of them for the Baltimore Orioles is that Miguel Gonzalez pitched six complete innings last night. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 8 H, 4 R, 1 BB, 1 K. Gonzalez had his share of struggles, however he certainly pitched well enough for the Orioles to win the game. He was also the first Oriole starter to pitch six innings since he himself did it back on April 14th.Gonzalez only issued one free pass, but even that came back to hurt the Birds. Even though the O\xe2\x80\x99s haven\xe2\x80\x99t executed during this losing streak, they\xe2\x80\x99ve also run into some hot pitching \xe2\x80\x93 such as Rick Porcello of Boston last night. Porcello pitched a perfect game into the fourth, and actually struck out five of the first six Orioles that he faced.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s back2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Orioles sign Craig Gentry to minor-league deal2/17 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Johnson wants to revitalize his careerThe perfecto was broken up in the last of the fourth when Manny Machado sent a hot liner up the middle for a base hit. That brought the hot-swinging Jimmy Paredes to the plate, and a moment later the 0-0 tie was broken as well. Paredes sent a deep shot towards the flag court in right field, and as the ball became a souvenir the Orioles took a 2-0 lead.However as MASN analyst and Orioles Hall of Famer Rick Dempsey says,\xc2\xa0nothing good happens after a walk. Gonzalez recorded two quick outs in the fifth only to issue a two-out walk (his only of the game) to Mookie Betts. Dustin Pedroia added a single, and Boston covered the corners. However even with David Ortiz striding to the plate, there was still a good chance that the O\xe2\x80\x99s could get out of the inning unscathed given the fact that there were two outs. However it was not to be, as Ortiz homered to right. To top it off, Hanley Ramirez (the next hitter) decided to homer as well, and Boston led 4-2.However keep in mind that the Fighting Showalters are nothing else if not resilant. (And incidentally, while this five-game losing streak is a concern that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why Orioles fans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry too much.) After losing a lead, many teams of yesteryear would just wither away for the remainder of the night. But that was not to be for this team.The Orioles of course had called up Rey Navarro from triple-A Norfolk earlier inCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsthe day after sending Ryan Flaherty to the DL with a strained groin. Navarro had played in the neighborhood of 800 games in the minor leagues, and he made his big league debut last night for the Birds at second base. And the early returns were very good. After the O\xe2\x80\x99s lost the lead, Navarro hit a liner to left field, that was misplayed by\xc2\xa0Hanley Ramirez and ruled a hit \xe2\x80\x93 Navarro\xe2\x80\x99s first as a big leaguer. And that sparked a mini-rally, as Navarro scored on Everth Cabrera\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single to cut the Boston lead to 4-3.Cabrera would also tie the game for the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the seventh with a sac fly-RBI. That of course put Gonzalez off the hook for the loss, and it reset the game. The Orioles would end up in a two-out bases loaded situation with Machado coming to the plate later in the inning. Machado worked the count to 3-2, and sat on a fastball at the end. He got that fastball, however he swung through it and ended the inning with a strikeout.Brian Matusz was brought in to face Pablo Sandoval in the last of the eighth (after Tommy Hunter recorded two quick outs). Matusz walked Sandoval\xc2\xa0(nothing good happens after a walk), and Buck Showalter went to Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day. That prompted Boston manager John Farrell to pinch hit Allen Craig, who reached on a Manny Machado fielding error. It was a bouncy ground ball, that trickled under Machado\xe2\x80\x99s glove; I was a bit surprised they gave him an error on the play, however it was a play that Manny would normally make. After the game, Machado spoke with MASNsports\xe2\x80\x99 Steve Melewski about the error:I\xe2\x80\x99m guarding the line and just trying to make an out. You know how it goes after an error, here comes a big shot. It happened, but we try to battle and keep grinding. It\xe2\x80\x99s part of the game and we have to keep our heads up and go get them tomorrow.Almost predictable, Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Brock Holt came up following Craig and smacked a three-run homer which effectively ended the game. While Chris Davis added a solo shot in the last of the eighth to close the gap to 7-5, that\xe2\x80\x99s as close as the Orioles could get.In the past this team\xe2\x80\x99s been marked by the fact that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t walk people and they played good defense. Right now they\xe2\x80\x99re going through a stretch whereby those things are happening. Now in fairness, the O\xe2\x80\x99s only walked two hitters last night, which is actually very decent if you think about it. However both of those walks came in to score \xe2\x80\x93 the final one of course being the most important.I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry so much about the walks and errors as I would what happens after those things. There\xe2\x80\x99s no difference in terms of the effect if you walk someone or give up a base hit. However it\xe2\x80\x99s what you do to deal with the base runner that makes a difference between winning and losing. And the same is true of errors. If the Orioles can deal with miscues in games better, they\xe2\x80\x99ll start winning again.The series continues this evening at Camden Yards with Wei-Yin Chen on the mound. The Orioles are in need of a stopper, and their hope is that tonight it\xe2\x80\x99s Chen. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Justin Masterson, with game time set for just after 7 PM.

04/26/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Little Things that Win and Lose Games', ""Apr 25, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles left fielder David Lough (9) celebrates with teammates at home plate after hitting a walk-off home run off Boston Red Sox relief pitcher Koji Uehara (not pictured) in the tenth inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Baltimore Orioles defeated Boston Red Sox 5-4. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsBefore talking about the topic introduced by the title, let me mention that it is the fourth title that I had for this article following the Baltimore Orioles 5-4, 10th-inning win over the Boston Red Sox on Saturday night. As you surely know by now, it was a David Lough walk-off home run off Koji Uehara that broke the five-game losing streak. Lough has not had a great start this season, just like last year. But what may be forgotten is that on April 12th of 2014, he hit a walk-off single in the bottom of the 12th inning against the Blue Jays that scored Steve Lombardozzi, who had tripled.Here are my other three headlines that, one by one, became obsolete as the evening progressed:When it looked like the Orioles were likely to win the game in regulation, with Wei-Yin Chen posting eight very good innings of two-run baseball, the headline I had already typed was \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jimmy Paredes Hit Parade.\xe2\x80\x9d At that point he was 4-for-4 with a home run that looked to be the game-winning blow, since Zach Britton was coming in to close it out. Oh well \xe2\x80\xa6Britton was not at his best on this evening, but he deserved better than a blown save after the Sox managed to get a run on two infield hits and a Manny Machado throwing error. An accurate throw would have ended the game right there; but instead, it was now tied. For what seems like the umpteenth night in a row, O\xe2\x80\x99s fans could look back to losses where just one play made differently would have changed the outcome. So, in planning to chronicle that, my working title was \xe2\x80\x9cBaltimore Orioles: One Play a Day Away from a Winning Record.\xe2\x80\x9dThat title still would have worked if Boston did win the game on the strength of a top-of-the-10th homer by Xander Bogaerts. But the home team Birds got a leadoff triple from Adam Jones, who scored the tying run on a Chris Davis sac fly (his second of the game) \xe2\x80\xa6 all right before the final winning blast by Lough. So, in thinking about how the O\xe2\x80\x99s utility outfielder has been brutalized in comments by many fans on various boards, I went to a title of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lough-ly O becomes Highly Valuable.\xe2\x80\x9dBut, I next saw that my colleague Nate Wardle was already working on a game summary; so let\xe2\x80\x99s look a bit deeper into three seemingly little things that are examples of what can make a difference in a close baseball game.Relief pitching on a good, damp night \xe2\x80\x93 This is one of the most difficult things to do as a baseball player. It is one of my most distinct memories as a college pitcher who played in the Northeast. Sitting around for hours before being summoned into a cold game is extremely difficult \xe2\x80\x93 much more than starting the game when the temps are a bit milder and there is a long warmup.Both closers got a blown save last night, with Uehara getting a loss as well. The only relief pitcher who looked good on this evening was Matt Barnes \xe2\x80\x93 a young guy making his first appearance of the season in the Bigs. Before this game, his MLB career consisted of nine innings pitched.Obviously, Buck pretty much had to get Chen out of the game after eight innings. It is still April. But I\xe2\x80\x99d bet everything that he would have finished off the game well. Every time you make a pitching change on a cold, damp night, you are asking for trouble; and that is what happened on Friday night when Tommy Hunter was taken out after 1.2 good innings. Just ride the hot hand when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got one!Defensive changes and using the whole roster \xe2\x80\x93 Showalter chose to have David Lough pinch run for Travis Snider in the eighth inning. Yes, this put more speed on the bases in an effort to secure an insurance run, and it almost worked. Lough went to third on a Caleb Joseph single (which Snider could not have done), and should have scored on a suicide squeeze if Rey Navarro had gotten the bunt down.But now Lough is in the game as a defensive replacement.On the other side, the Red Sox manager John Farrell does not choose to replace right fielder Allen Craig with a better defender to protect his one-run lead in the bottom of the 10th.\xc2\xa0 Adam Jones bloops a ball toward right-center that Craig attempts an awkward and ill-fated catch, allowing it beyond him for a leadoff triple \xe2\x80\x93 very dumb. Actually, counting Farrell, it was dumb and dumber \xe2\x80\x93 should make a movie by that title!Baserunning mistakes can kill a team \xe2\x80\x93 The Orioles have had their share of these lately. But the Red Sox had one cost them dearly in the 10th With runners at first and second and one out, with David Ortiz at the plate, Big Sloppy hit a weak ground ball toward second base. Shrub Pedroia, instead of stopping and forcing the infielder to come get him (allowing even the big tortoise to get to first base), or forcing the fielder to throw to first (allowing the Shrub to run safely to second base), he ran right into the out and therefore into a double play. Inning over, cue David Lough.The fundamental things apply as time goes by.And now that the Orioles have broken the silly losing streak and even had a couple of decent starts, perhaps some momentum in the opposite direction can now follow.Next: David Lough Walks Off the O'sMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Our flag was still there - Birds Watcher', 'Baltimore is of course a city with a very special distinction in that our national anthem was written in our very own harbor by Francis Scott Key. What we now know as the \xe2\x80\x9cStar-Spangled Banner\xe2\x80\x9d began as a poem titled\xc2\xa0The Defense of Fort McHenry, and of course it was inspired by the United States defeating Great Britain in Baltimore during the War of 1812.\xc2\xa0This of course is represented by a line we hear before every Baltimore Orioles game:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6that our flag was still there.Last night\xe2\x80\x99s game presented one of the most bizarre sets of circumstances in the history of Camden Yards. The O\xe2\x80\x99s were getting ready to play Boston, all while people were taking to the streets and violently protesting the death of Freddie Gray in the city. And when I say violent, there were police in riot gear around the ballpark, a 7-11 in the neighborhood was looted (among other stores), windows at Dempsey\xe2\x80\x99s Brew Pub were smashed in, cars were turned over, among other things. However through this, the O\xe2\x80\x99s played on.For starters, Wei-Yin Chen pitched possibly the best outing an Oriole starter has given this year. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 8 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 1 BB, 5 K. While when all was said and done the O\xe2\x80\x99s used three relievers, Chen appeared to have done a great service for the bullpen at the time. And he had the lead early, after Jimmy Paredes\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-double and Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x98 sac fly-RBI in the last of the first.However keep in mind that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are being held to attest to every mishap that they make early this season. Hanley Ramirez drew a four-pitch walk to lead off the second, and Mike Napoli hit a shot to right that grazed off the foul pole for a home run which tied the game. It appeared that the ball was going to go foul, but it stayed just straight enough to touch the pole. However aside from that, Chen was cruising \xe2\x80\x93 while parts of the city figuratively burned.Jimmy Paredes had a great night at the plate, and he\xe2\x80\x99s quickly showing his worth to Buck Showalter and his coaching staff. The O\xe2\x80\x99s took a 3-2 lead in the last of the fifth on Paredes\xe2\x80\x99 solo homer, and for some time all was well in Birdland. As we went to the 9th inning, Zach Britton reliever Chen to close out the game. With the bases loaded and one out, we were reminded once again just how fine the line can be between winning and losing.Pablo Sandoval hit a bouncer to Manny Machado at third. Machado stepped on the bag for one out, and threw across the diamond for what would have been the second out \xe2\x80\x93 which would have ended the game. However Machado\xe2\x80\x99s throw was errant, allowing Dustin Pedroia (who reached on a lead off walk) to score and tie the game. Errors and walks\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s the same story. The saving grace was that Hanley Ramirez (who was behind Pedroia on the base paths) thought the game was over and didn\xe2\x80\x99t take home plate on the throwing error. So in fact, perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake on Boston\xe2\x80\x99s side as well.Xander Bogaerts jumped on the first pitch he saw in the tenth and sent it over the wall in left center, giving Boston a 4-3 lead. So not only was there destructive civil unrest around the ballpark, but the O\xe2\x80\x99s were in the midst of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. To top it off, the mayor requested that anyone at the game stay in the ballpark \xe2\x80\x9cuntil further notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Baltimore City Police were literally blocking the exits of the stadium to prevent people from leaving. That order was lifted as we went to the last of the 10th\xe2\x80\xa6as was the pall that seemed to be over Baltimore and the Orioles.Adam Jones sent a soft liner to right center field to lead off the tenth, that slipped under the glove of a diving Mookie Betts and rolled towards the wall. Jones ended up with a triple, and he would score a moment later on Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 sac fly-RBI. So with David Lough coming to the plate with one down, the game appeared destined for the 11th inning\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6however Boston closer (former Oriole) Koji Uehara gave Lough a hangingCourtesy of Winslow Townson-USA TODAY Sportsfastball on 3-2. And\xc2\xa0Lough delivered\xe2\x80\xa6with a walk off homer onto the flag court. The win tied the series at one, setting up a rubber match this afternoon. Bud Norris will be on the bump for the Birds, in need of a win to set his season straight. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Wade Miley.Buck Showalter put this win in perspective with regard to what was happening outside the park after the game (quote courtesy of MLB.com\xe2\x80\x99s Brittany Ghirol):There are so many things that can take your attention away from a baseball game, rightfully so. As important as we think this is, there are some things that are more important.As unfortunate as the ninth inning was, make no mistake about the fact that Baltimore needed this win tonight \xe2\x80\x93 and exactly as it unfolded at that. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about the Orioles simply breaking a five-game losing streak. That plays a role also, however the city itself needed an uplift after so much destruction over the course of the evening.This game was very much a \xe2\x80\x9cBaltimore story.\xe2\x80\x9d The team fought, and just when it looked to be over and done\xe2\x80\xa6a near unknown became a instant hero. And an instant hero when one was needed most at that. Baltimore is a resilent city with a proud past which includes the writing of our national anthem.

MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, in Baltimore on a previously-scheduled trip, said it was exploring alternatives for the remainder of the series, and didn\'t rule out other venues, such as Nationals Park in Washington.However, a person with direct knowledge of the plans says the first option under consideration is playing a day game at Camden Yards. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is ongoing.Monday\'s game was postponed about 45 minutes before the scheduled 7:05 ET start. Shortly thereafter, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake declared a weeklong, citywide curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.,  imperiling the 7:05 ET starts Tuesday and Wednesday.Manfred said MLB and the clubs are considering ""every alternative"" to stage the games.""We feel like we made the decision that would provide us the greatest possible security, in terms of protecting the fans, the players, the umpires, everybody involved,"" Manfred told reporters in Baltimore. ""We\'re looking at every possible alternative in terms of completing the schedule in a timely way and making sure the games are played in a secured situation that\'s safe for the fans. We\'re going to look at every alternative.""The funeral for Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old who died while in custody of Baltimore City Police, was held Monday, and pockets of civil unrest took a violent turn as protestors clashed with police, destroyed patrol cars and looted stores.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Orioles COO John Angelos offers eye-opening perspective on Baltimore protestsFor most of Monday afternoon, the violence centered on an area about 4 miles northwest of Camden Yards but spread closer to downtown Baltimore as game time approached. Multiple entrance gates to Camden Yards were closed, but the postponement was not announced until a smattering of fans already entered the park..White Sox center fielder Adam Eaton told the Chicago Tribune the team was being escorted from the stadium.""It\'s a little scary,"" Eaton said. ""You never want anything to happen to anybody attending a baseball game, on the playing field or anybody involved or in the city. We don\'t really want to tangle with that or put anybody in danger, so I think it\'s the best from everyone\'s perspective to cancel the game and hopefully the police officers and officials can get the situation under control.""GALLERY: Baltimore protests disrupt Camden YardsFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInBaltimore protests disrupt Camden Yards\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

He died April 19 after suffering a severe spinal injury in police custody.The Orioles announced the postponement about 40 minutes before gametime. About 1,000 fans were inside the stadium at the time, and many gates already had been closed.The team said the game was called off after consultation with police. The White Sox were in Baltimore for the start of a three-game series.""We feel like we made the decision that would provide us the greatest possible security in terms of protecting the fans, the players, the umpires, everybody involved in the game,"" Manfred said. ""I don\'t know what more I can say about it at this point.""Prior to the game, Orioles players gathered around a television in the clubhouse and watched the violence unfold. Police blocked off several streets near Camden Yards.""There\'s so many things that go on that you get challenged with, obviously this is a different level,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""There\'s not a lot of experience with it.""""So you try to take each moment as it comes and I know there were a lot of calls to some guys\' families about making sure they knew what was going on from a safety standpoint. But guys are watching it. They are all aware of what\'s going on,"" he said.White Sox manager Robin Ventura said his team was aware of the escalating situation.""I mean we\'re definitely keeping tabs on it. If there\'s anything to do, to go ahead and respond to it. But you know, it\'s concerning to anybody, I think, any time it becomes a violent protest, everybody is on high alert and you\'re trying to do what\'s best for the game and the players,"" he said.There was no immediate word on a makeup date for Monday\'s game.Major League Baseball has postponed and shifted games in the past because of unrest.In 1992, the Dodgers had four games postponed in Los Angeles following the Rodney King verdict.In 1967, the Orioles and Tigers had a game postponed because of riots in Detroit. The next two games were shifted to Baltimore.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The secondary question was whether or not starter Bud Norris would be able to get himself together. We got resounding answers to both questions, and ironically those answers were both a resounding YES. The Orioles used twenty hits to defeat Boston 18-7. Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 6.2 IP, 7 H, 3 R, 3 BB, 2 K.With the O\xe2\x80\x99s already leading 1-0 in the last of the third, Adam Jones drew a four-pitch walk with the bases loaded and nobody out. Before we knew it, the score then went to 3-0 after Delmon Young\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single, which was followed by Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x98 two-RBI double. Steve Pearce would add an RBI-single, and Jimmy Paredes grounded into a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice-RBI before the end of the inning. So to review; Oriole bats, which had previously been silent in a sense, proceeded to effectively end the competitive phase of the game before the end of the third inning.

Delmon Young, who had himself a day, came up again in the last of the fourth and ran the score to 9-0 with a two-RBI single. One inning later Rey Navarro\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single sent the Orioles over double-digits for the day at 10-0. By this point third base coach Bobby Dickerson\xe2\x80\x99s arm might have been starting to tire due to waving so many runners home, however he got a freebie in the sense that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to wave a runner around because Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 homer made the score 11-0.The O\xe2\x80\x99s would add another on a Jimmy Paredes RBI-triple, but then Boston fought back \xe2\x80\x93 just a bit. Pablo Sandoval smacked a three-run homer in the seventh with two outs, which ended Norris\xe2\x80\x99 day. The Orioles probably left Norris in for one pitch too many, however when you have a twelve-run lead one three-run homer shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bother you. However after Buck Showalter summoned Jason Garcia from the bullpen, Hanley Ramirez hit the first pitch he saw out of the park to narrow the lead to 12-4.But this was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0moment in the sun, and they weren\xe2\x80\x99t about to let Boston back into the game on their day. Adam Jones smacked an RBI-single in the last of the seventh, followed by another two-RBI double by Delmon Young. Toss on a Steve Pearce RBI-single, and a Jimmy Paredes RBI-double\xe2\x80\xa6oh yeah, and Ryan Lavarnway scored on a pass ball \xe2\x80\x93 just for good measure. Garcia would allow another three-run homer to Sandoval in the ninth, but it was to little too late for Boston.Following the civil unrest in the city on Saturday night, it was going to be interesting to see what the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 attendance would end up being yesterday. The city of Baltimore and the Orioles fans didn\xe2\x80\x99t let the team down, as an enthusiastic announced crowd of over 43,800 people in attendance. Buck Showalter offered a top of the cap to the crowd in postgame comments, via Roch Kubatko of MASNsports:I was curious to see how many people we would have today.That was pretty impressive. I really thank them, too. They had something to do with that game today. There was a great feel in the ballpark, more than just baseball.To have that many people show up tells you how much they love the Orioles and how much confidence they have in this city. Pretty impressive. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go unnoticed.I got a couple of tweets during the game to which I want to respond en masse this morning in the column. Several people questioned if the O\xe2\x80\x99s were running up the score. And the answer is no \xe2\x80\x93 not in my view, at least. So long as you\xe2\x80\x99re not trying to manufacture runs via stolen bases, moving guys over, etc, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t running up the score in baseball. But it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly unreasonable to expect any team to purposely swing through pitches, record outs, etc., even with a lead like that. In fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s just as disrespectful as manufacturing runs.Jason Garcia got knocked around a bit, however working in this game was good experience for him. It also gave the Orioles a chance to keep everyone else in the bullpen rested for the upcoming Chicago series. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day got up to get warm in the 9th, however the Orioles only used two pitchers in the game. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see how long the O\xe2\x80\x99s will be able to carry Garcia. I can\xe2\x80\x99t see them being able to do it for the entire series, that is unless he spends some time on the DL for whatever reason.The Orioles now stay at home all week and through next weekend for a long homestand. Obviously they opened it up in grand fashion by taking two-of-three from a division rival (including an 18-7 drubbing yesterday). But tonight they\xe2\x80\x99ll open up a three-game series with the ChiSox, who ironically will be the first non-AL East opponent that the Orioles will face. Ubaldo Jimenez will get the start for the Birds tonight, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Hector Noesi. Game time is set for just after 7 PM.  ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

There are very real concerns that have to be addressed, or we will find ourselves facing the same scenario over and over again, with only the name of the city changed. But running away isn\'t the answer, and that\'s exactly what baseball is doing. Imagine the surreal sights and sounds from Wednesday\'s game: Empty seats everywhere you look, with only the dugouts and field occupied. The PA system echoing across the stadium. It\'s a scene we\'ve seen in Europe, when soccer clubs have been forced to play behind closed doors as a result of their fans\' reprehensible \xe2\x80\x93 usually racist \xe2\x80\x93 behavior. In this case, however, neither the Orioles nor their fans have done anything wrong. By forcing them to flee their stadium, baseball is giving into fear rather than standing tall against violence and mayhem. And that ought to scare all of us more than anything that\'s happening on the streets.

There will be no cheering, and no booing. Nor will there be heckling, hot dogs, or beer. There will be no fans in the stadium at all, in fact. After riots in the city forced the postponement of games for two straight days, Major League Baseball announced that the Orioles will play on Wednesday, but the game will be closed to the public.Related StoryTwo States of Emergency in BaltimoreFor a sport that takes significant pride in its history, this may be a particularly sad first: An MLB official told me that after conferring with a historian and several longtime veterans of the game, the league was unaware of any prior examples in which fans have been deliberately barred from attending a game. Those with tickets to the game (or either of the ones postponed) can exchange them for a game later in the season, and they\'ll still be able to watch Wednesday\'s contest on TV. The league is also moving the Orioles\' next three games to Tampa, where they\'ll be the ""home team"" against the Rays at Tropicana Field\xe2\x80\x94a move typically made during emergencies caused by natural disasters, not civil unrest. When rioting erupted in Los Angeles following the Rodney King verdict in 1992, the Dodgers postponed four games until later in the season. More recently, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, forced Major League Baseball to cancel games for a week across the country. Recommended: Nonviolence as ComplianceWhile it hasn\'t happened in baseball, soccer matches overseas have been played in empty stadiums, although those decisions are usually made to punish a team or its fans for bad conduct. MLB teams in small markets routinely play before crowds so tiny that the stadiums probably feel empty. But this is different.Baseball, of course, doesn\'t matter much compared with the pain of parents who lost their son in the back of a police van. It probably isn\'t a concern to the families of officers injured in the riots, or to shop-owners who\'ve watched their businesses get looted and torched. Nobody made that point more eloquently than the Orioles\' chief operating officer (and the son of the team\'s owner), John Angelos, who wrote in a series of tweets on Monday that the systemic problems that led to Freddie Gray\'s death make ""inconvenience at a ball park irrelevant."" Here\'s a partial transcript, via Deadspin: Recommended: The Mysterious Death of Freddie Gray Speaking only for myself I agree ... that the principle of peaceful, non-violent protest and the observance of the rule of law is of utmost importance in any society. MLK, Gandhi, Mandela, and all great opposition leaders throughout history have always preached this proper precept. Further, it is critical that in any democracy investigation must be completed and due process must be honored before any government or police members are judged responsible. That said, my greater source of personal concern, outrage and sympathy beyond this particular case is focused neither upon one night\xe2\x80\x99s property damage nor upon the acts group but is focused rather upon the past four-decade period during which an American political elite have shipped middle class and working class jobs away from Baltimore and cities and towns around the US to 3rd world dictatorships like China and others plunged tens of millions of good hard working Americans into economic devastation, and then followed that action around the nation by diminishing every American\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights protections in order to control an unfairly impoverished population living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state. The innocent working families of all backgrounds whose lives and dreams have been cut short by excessive violence, surveillance, and other abuses of the Bill of Rights by government pay the true price, an ultimate price, and one that far exceeds the importance of any kids\xe2\x80\x99 game played tonight, or ever, at Camden Yards. We need to keep in mind people are suffering and dying around the US and while we are thankful no on was injured at Camden Yards, there is a far bigger picture for poor Americans in Baltimore and everywhere who don\xe2\x80\x99t have jobs and are losing economic civil and legal rights and this makes inconvenience at a ball game irrelevant in light of the needless suffering government is inflicting upon ordinary Americans. The MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday that ""after conversations with the Orioles and local officials, we believe that these decisions are in the best interests of fan safety and the deployment of city resources."" With Governor Larry Hogan deploying the national guard and neighboring states sending in reinforcements, certainly Baltimore police officers have better things to do than protect 20,000 fans at Oriole Park. (Though playing baseball in a burning city is not without precedent, as the Daily Beast\'s Justin Miller noted.) On the other hand, why not simply postpone this game as well? What\'s the point of a baseball game without fans? The ballpark will be eerily quiet, a stark contrast to the unrest outside that will undoubtedly affect both the fans watching on TV and the players on the field. It\'s not how baseball is supposed to be, which suggests that the decision to play the game in an empty stadium is more than just a tactical move; it\'s a statement about the behavior of a fractured city.This article was originally published at http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/04/an-empty-stadium-in-baltimore/391736/?UTM_SOURCE=yahooRead more from The Atlantic \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Brutality of Police Culture in Baltimore \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How Wealth in Childhood Shapes Personality Later in Life ', 'www.yahoo.com')]"

People are always watching.""The only visible fans \xe2\x80\x93 actually more audible than visible \xe2\x80\x93 were a handful on the balconies of a nearby hotel and a couple dozen who began chanting, ""Let\'s go, O\'s"" from outside the stadium behind center field.And when the Star-Spangled Banner played to an empty ballpark, that same group maintained a Baltimore tradition - shouting ""Ohhhhhh!"" at the start of the final verse.The game presentation was set up to be as normal as possible \xe2\x80\x93 with the glaring exception of sea of empty green seats.Lineups were on the scoreboard. Orioles players got their normal personalized walk-up music as they came to bat but, as Davis lamented, there would be no crab shuffle game on the scoreboard between innings.Orioles catcher Caleb Joseph tipped his cap \xe2\x80\x93 to no one \xe2\x80\x93 as he jogged to the bullpen to warm up starting pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez, and pantomimed signing autographs before the game.Ball girls were along each foul line. Two scouts watched from behind home plate. The only other people in the seating area were several press photographers and the man who logs the pitch speeds on the scoreboard.But it was undeniable that things were different once the game started.GALLERY: A day without fans at Camden YardsFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInA day without fans at Camden Yards\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

But the empty stadium made the ball\'s landing audible even several hundred feet away. The home run call of Baltimore TV announcer Gary Thorne - ""Goodbye, home run!"" - was audible in the stadium.Players on both teams grappled with balancing the desire for a return to normalcy after peaceful protests that deteriorated into riots and looting with ongoing safety issues.""We all just need to get back out there,"" White Sox center fielder Adam Eaton says of his team\'s second game since last Friday (they were rained out Saturday in Chicago). ""But one part of me says this is bigger than baseball. Another part of me says we shouldn\'t adjust to what people do outside the stadium. I\'m trying to be as delicate as possible with that, but I think normalcy would be good for the people around the city.""     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } For Dodgers, unrest in Baltimore evokes memories of \'92 riotsThe White Sox hadn\'t left their hotel \xe2\x80\x93 within walking distance of Camden Yards \xe2\x80\x93 for two days except for a workout Tuesday.""It\'s been kind of crazy,"" Eaton says. ""We\'ve had movies, ordering food in, a lot of video games \xe2\x80\x93 you have to get your competition somewhere. It\'s been good team bonding. Baseball players are very good at wasting time.""Eaton joked, ""We\'re going to try to take the crowd out of it early,"" then said, ""There\'s a pureness to it. It\'s kind of Field of Dream-ish - just a baseball game.""But the gravity of the situation wasn\'t lost on anyone.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Rays relieved by series move: \'We just didn\'t want to go to Baltimore\'""I watched the news more in the last couple of days than I have in my whole entire life,"" says Davis. ""Just to see the anger, the emotion, the frustration of the city the last few days was shocking. It\'s frustrating. I understand why people are upset and rightfully so. It\'s unfortunate that it\'s escalated to what it has. I think a lot of people were trying to do things the right way. I think there\'s still a long way to go but I think we\'re headed in the right direction.""The baseball reality for the Orioles will be three games at Tampa Bay this weekend, a series that had been schedule for Baltimore. They also face a doubleheader May 28, previously an open date, to make up the games postponed this week.""We need this game to be played but we need this city to be healed first,"" Jones says. ""We\'ve seen good. We\'ve seen bad. We\'ve seen ugly. Our games canceled, postponed, relocated, a city that is hurting, a city that needs its heads of the city to step up and help the ones who are hurting.""Jones sent a direct message to the youth of the city, some of whom have been in the middle of the most violent of the protests.""Someone has your back,"" he said. ""When you look at the picture, it looks like no one is fighting for you. There are people like myself, not only athletes but civic leaders who are effecting change.""""I\'d say to the youth,"" Jones continued, ""your frustration is warranted. It\'s understandable, understood. The actions I don\'t think are acceptable. But this is their cry. Obviously, this isn\'t a cry that\'s acceptable but it\'s their cry and therefore we have to understand it and accept it. They need hugs. They need love. They need support. I\'m going to try to give as much as I can because the city needs it.""On this day, baseball was part of the process.""Baseball, sports, these are things that unite communities in dark times,"" Jones said.But the eerie silence made it clear how different this particular game was.As Orioles manager Buck Showalter said, ""Let\'s not lose sight of why we\'re at this point.""<!-- comment -->CONNECTTWEET                              10                      LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com')]"

    Slide Show      Slide Show|13 Photos A (Quiet) Day at the Ballpark     A (Quiet) Day at the Ballpark  CreditPatrick Semansky/Associated Press              BALTIMORE \xe2\x80\x94 On what might have been a perfect spring afternoon to sit with a beer and a hot dog and watch baseball, an eerie emptiness greeted the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday in what was believed to be the first major league game played without spectators.Except for two scouts sitting behind home plate and a press box full of reporters, the 45,971 seats and three decks at Camden Yards were an empty expanse of green when the first pitch was thrown at 2:06 p.m. in what became an 8-2 Orioles victory.\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t the way you want to make history,\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Davis, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first baseman, said before he hit a three-run homer in the first inning as Baltimore took a 6-0 lead.The police presence was light around the empty stadium amid the unrest in this troubled city after the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American who died after sustaining a severe spinal injury while in police custody. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Three dozen or so fans peeked through a fence beyond left-center field, shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cOhhh,\xe2\x80\x9d at the familiar moment of \xe2\x80\x9cO say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave\xe2\x80\x9d in the national anthem, a Camden Yards tradition. Still, for the first time in recent memory, the anthem was recorded instead of sung.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Those distant fans clapped and yelled when Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s first batter, Adam Eaton, struck out, and they greeted each Baltimore run with jubilant cheer. A \xe2\x80\x9cGo Orioles\xe2\x80\x9d banner hung from the balcony of a nearby hotel, where other fans gathered to watch. But that faraway support could not relieve a barren afternoon.When the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 leadoff hitter, left fielder Alejandro De Aza, fouled off a series of pitches in the bottom of the first before drawing a walk, one of the balls bounced back onto the field. The other two came to rest among the empty seats and were not immediately retrieved.When Davis followed with a long blast to right field, the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s usual roar of anticipation for a home run was strangely absent. So was the customary scramble for the ball as it cleared the fence and landed on the Eutaw Street walkway. Normally, the street would have been busy with foot traffic for a restaurant, a barbecue stand and the team\xe2\x80\x99s souvenir shop. On Wednesday, though, the walkway was closed. Only a television cameraman stood in the vicinity of the home run.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The stadium was so quiet that Gary Thorne, a television announcer for the Orioles, could be heard exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cGoodbye!\xe2\x80\x9d from his booth as Davis\xe2\x80\x99s shot left the park.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The scoreboard was in operation. \xe2\x80\x9cTake Me Out to the Ballgame\xe2\x80\x9d and John Denver\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThank God I\xe2\x80\x99m a Country Boy\xe2\x80\x9d played as usual during the seventh-inning stretch. But the sound of the ball against the bat left a hollow echo in the vacant stadium. Buck Showalter, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 manager, said the bullpen phone could be heard ringing more than 400 feet from the dugout. Relief pitchers for the Orioles said they could hear strikes called by the umpire Jerry Layne, a rarity in the bullpen, and could even follow the chatter among the outfielders. This only added to a sense of desolation.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In the eighth inning, an announcement was made in the press box that apparently had never been made at a major league game. For official record-keeping purposes, the announcer said, Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s paid attendance was \xe2\x80\x94 pause \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9czero.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gary Thorne does his best Masters voice Video by MLB  Still, there was some levity on the field. Caleb Joseph, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 catcher, gave imaginary high-fives to imaginary fans, and signed make-believe autographs, as he headed to the bullpen for his pregame warm-up. Several times, Davis said, he tossed balls to nonexistent fans behind the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout between innings.\xe2\x80\x9cLaughter does something for the soul,\xe2\x80\x9d Joseph said.Yet early on, intermittent sounds of distant sirens, their source unclear, brought a more somber tone to the afternoon. Adam Jones, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 center fielder and perhaps the most popular African-American athlete in Baltimore, described the turmoil in previous days as a cry of frustration by the city\xe2\x80\x99s youth.

Privacy Policy     \xe2\x80\x9cYour frustration is warranted; it\xe2\x80\x99s understood,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said before the game.At the same time, he said about the destruction of property: \xe2\x80\x9cThe actions I don\xe2\x80\x99t think are acceptable. But if you come from where they come from, you understand. But I think ruining a community that you have to live in is never the answer due to the fact you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to wake up in three or four days and go right back to those convenience stores.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  After postponements on Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game was shifted to the afternoon from its scheduled 7:05 p.m. start because of a nightly curfew here.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThe nightmare of a week continues for the Baltimore Orioles. Not only did they lose two games to postponement because of the unrest \xe2\x80\x93 games that will be played later in May \xe2\x80\x93 they also have to go to be the HOME team at Tropicana Field. That is quite a demotion from the awesomeness of Camden Yards to the hollowness of The Trop.But as Buck always says, you have to meet the challenges that come your way and grind through them, nobody is going to feel sorry for you. Well, I feel sorry for them.In any event, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will be the home team wearing the home whites and sending Chris Tillman to the mound. Tillman has not had the seasonal start he would desire, but you have to know that he is going to get it together, and now would be the time to do it. He comes in with a 7.58 ERA so far, but his career numbers against the Rays are 3.57. As well, Tillman handled the Rays well in the first game of the season, going 6.2 innings with one run on four hits and three walks.Facing the Birds will be Alex Colome making his first appearance in 2015. The young Dominican had visa issues this spring, while also contracting pneumonia. He has only thrown 23.2 career innings in the big leagues, but he has a victory over the Orioles last June 27th in beating Kevin Gausman.The Orioles are 10-10 coming into the game and series, trailing the AL East-leading Yankees by two games. New York is 13-9, Boston and Tampa Bay are 12-10, with the Jays at 11-12.\xc2\xa0like a stink bug floating in the toilet bowl, the Yankees refuse to die.How are the Yankees doing this?It is as annoying as it is surprising that the New York Yankees are winning and leading the AL East. Writers and analysts have been predicting their demise for that last several years. But like a stink bug floating in the toilet bowl (how\xe2\x80\x99s that for a word picture?) the Yankees refuse to die.So how are the Yankees winning? It is not with starting pitching, as they have not been dominant at all. Masahiro Tanaka is now on the DL, and CC Sabathia has been particularly poor.

Miller has eight saves.What has really helped the Yankees is better offence than might be expected. Jacoby Ellsbury and Brett Gardner are setting the table, each with a .406 OBP and batting averages over .300.\xc2\xa0 Chris Young is hitting .305, though his career average is only .235.\xc2\xa0 And while a number of the Yanks are really scuffling at the plate (Beltran \xe2\x80\x93 .162, Drew \xe2\x80\x93 .177, Gregorius \xe2\x80\x93 .206, Headley \xe2\x80\x93 .232), the duo of Alex Rodriquez and Mark Teixeira are hitting homers and driving in runs. A-Rod has five homers and Teixeira has eight with 18 RBIs. The latter is only hitting .216, but 13 of his 16 hits have been for extra bases.All of this cannot continue as it is (except for the relief, which could be the best in baseball). There is no way the Yankees are going to hit and score at this clip long-term.For the Orioles, they do have to grind it out. One thing for sure is that there will be more fans in attendance in St. Pete than their most recent game \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe not many more, but just a few. And the O\xe2\x80\x99s fans at The Trop might just outnumber the Rays fans.

Steve Johnson continued his streak of scoreless outings and lowered his season ERA to .73, though he allowed an inherited runner to score before closing out the 5th inning. Pedro Beato also pitched 1.2 scoreless innings. Dariel Alvarez led the offense with a 3-4 day (double, RBI) and Michael Almanzar was 2-4.    Frederick Keys 9, Salem Red Sox 8 The Keys prevailed in a wild one which saw starter Matt Taylor\xc2\xa0removed in the 3rd after having been struck in the head by a line drive. The Keys committed five errors, including two on pickoff attempts by reliever Dylan Rheault (more info on Rheault from this past week at\xc2\xa0Baseball Prospectus). Great game from Adrian Marin. The young middle infielder (still one of the youngest Keys in his second season) swatted two doubles and walked twice. The Red Sox stole a staggering eight bases off Steel Russell (son of O\'s bench coach John Russell). He managed a bit of revenge by throwing out a baserunner and driving in four runs Journeyman lefty Cody Wheeler picked up the win for the Keys. The Keys managed to come back to win it in the ninth.

Jamill Moquete homered and is now slashing .257/.422/,600 on the year. Conor Bierfeldt doubled twice and Jared Breen walked twice (.371 OBP). Starter John Means was victimized not only by errors, but by his own inability (along with Alex Murphy) to hold runners. The Sand Gnats stole three bases off the pair and while Murphy was able to Wuilmer Becerra once, he was also charged with a throwing error.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles played only their third game this week, as the team and the City of Baltimore attempt to return to a sense of normalcy.However, what was a homestand turned into one game against the White Sox and a \xe2\x80\x98home game\xe2\x80\x99 in Tampa Bay.The O\xe2\x80\x99s came into Tampa hitting well.\xc2\xa0 The Rays, meanwhile, have been pitching really well.\xc2\xa0 Everyone knows TB is not a team that is going to outscore you. However, their pitching, which is young, is very, very good.And Alex Colome, in his first start of the year, proved that. He only went five innings, but struck out six and only allowed three hits and no walks in those innings.Then, the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen came in and shut down the Orioles. In a way, this game was very similar to what the team was doing exactly a week ago. Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at why.Chris Tillman was cruising in the fourth inning.\xc2\xa0 But then he walked Asdrubel Cabrera with two outs, and up came Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s nemesis, Evan Longoria.\xc2\xa0 And Longoria drove home Cabrera, because Longoria always hurts the O\xe2\x80\x99s. James Loney would then drive in Longoria, and it was 2-0 in a hurry. And that was the game.Tillman pitched well, but walking a fairly weak hitter with two outs in the fourth inning is frustrating.Manny Machado made another error in this game, airmailing a throw to Chris Davis at first base.\xc2\xa0 And there was at least one other play, on a ground ball to third, that could have also been called an error.Afterward, in the dugout, Manny looked visibly upset as Jonathan Schoop tried to keep Manny\xe2\x80\x99s head in it. At this point, is Manny physically limited? Is it a lack of focus? I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, but it is concerning.Too many strikeouts also ended up hurting the O\xe2\x80\x99s, as the team struck out 13 times, tying the most they have struck out in 2015.

Walker had two doubles in addition to the homer. That was part of a 12-hit effort by the Tides offense. Teammates Nolan Reimold, Henry Urrutia, and Michael Almanzar also had multi-hit games.    Mike Wright started the game for Norfolk and netted himself a minimum quality start - six innings, three earned runs. Wright only gave up three hits and a walk but still ended up having the runs hung on him. Some days it\'s just not your day. He still got the win anyway. Oliver Drake grabbed his fourth save with a perfect ninth. Harrisburg (Walgreens) 2, Bowie Baysox 1 The Baysox managed to lose the game despite having 11 hits to Harrisburg\'s six. This wasted a gem of a game pitched by Tim Berry, who needed it after the beginning of his season. Berry gave up two runs on five hits and a walk in eight innings of work. He notched five strikeouts. Unfortunately, one of the five hits he allowed was a solo home run to .197 hitter Matt Skole and his teammates managed to score only one run even though they were 2-for-7 with runners in scoring position. Mike Yastrzemski, Chris O\'Brien, and Quincy Latimore each had a pair of hits for the Baysox.    Carolina (Braves) 1, Frederick Keys 0 Here we have another waste of a good starting pitching effort. Keys starter Mitch Horacek gave up just one run on three hits and three walks in six innings of work, while striking out six Mudcats batters. The run scored on a solo home run hit by Jacob Schrader.    Unfortunately for Horacek, his offense got him approximately bupkis.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles, in spite of the unusual week for the team and the city, are playing reasonably well as a number of good trends are setting into place.The Birds had a very good all-around game on Saturday evening in St. Petersburg against the Tampa Bay Rays, winning 4-0 behind what was probably the best start turned in by an O\xe2\x80\x99s pitcher so far this year. Miguel Gonzalez was in total command of his pitches, worked efficiently, and got the team through 7.2 very good innings before yielding to Brad Brach.The Orioles are now 11-11 \xe2\x80\x93 three games behind the Yankees, but only two in the loss column.Here are some good trends \xe2\x80\xa6Strong Offense \xe2\x80\x93 The Orioles have hit will over the season so far and are #2 in the American League in team average and #3 in on base percentage. Before this, when have we ever been able to make that latter statement? As well, the Birds have continued to be among the better teams in terms of clutch hitting with runners on base. Last night, Chris Davis kept an inning alive by driving in the first run of the game with two outs. This was followed by Steve Pearce doubling home two more runs. You have to love that.Improved Pitching \xe2\x80\x93 Without doubt, the Orioles got off to a very bad start on the season with the pitching. But this is now coming around. There have been five consecutive quality starts \xe2\x80\x93 one full cycle through the rotation \xe2\x80\x93 and it is no coincidence that the Orioles have won four of those games. The relievers are mostly looking better as well. Having the worst ERA in all of baseball just a week ago, the Birds now are 11th in the AL and rising.

No Gold Glove this year. But he is fine and will be fine. Fielders go through these stretches, as did J.J. Hardy for a few games in 2014. Manny still makes the great plays \xe2\x80\x93 did two of them last night. And the great plays he makes (that few others can) far outnumber the errors he will commit.Steve Pearce at Second Base \xe2\x80\x93 Hey, why not? I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten over not seeing him as an athlete, in that he does not have the sleek body type of such. He has basic baseball skills, and the Orioles have outstanding infield coaching. Pearce will hit (say, in any given stretch of 200 at-bats) better than Ryan Flaherty or Jonathan Schoop, though this may not always be true. His defense won\xe2\x80\x99t be as good, but neither is it likely to be a liability. Some are speculating that this means one of these other players is more severely injured than revealed and not likely to come back. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is it; I think this is Buck building his options.Caleb Joseph is getting it done \xe2\x80\x93 Man, he really caught all of a Chris Archer pitch last night and simply crushed it with a beautiful swing. He is now batting .327 on an 18-for-66; and he also has 10 walks to yield an OBP of .439. \xc2\xa0This is more than just getting it done, it is outstanding.Adam Jones is on the ball \xe2\x80\x93 Last night in four appearances, Jones hit three balls on the dime \xe2\x80\x93 all of them right at someone. He hit another average grounder and got a single. That\xe2\x80\x99s baseball.

So that's a unique way to have a walk-off. T.J. McFarland started and yielded 2 runs (1 earned) over 5.2 IP.    The Tides scored all 3 of their runs in the 6th. All came courtesy of a Jayson Nix double, though the 3rd one was deemed a result of an error by the centerfielder, so ix-nay on a Nix-ay RBI; just two for him.

The first of those would come around to score on an infield hit after Yacabonis had been lifted in favor of Williams Louico. Starter David Hess got roughed up for 3 runs in the 1st, but settled down after that and completed 5 IP without allowing any additional damage.    The offense clawed back 2 runs courtesy of a 5th inning dinger from Trey Mancin, his 3rd on the season. But other than that the offense was mostly the sound of one hand clapping. Or, perhaps more aptly, the sound of a spring breeze passing across a meadow seeing as they K'd 11 times. Poor Brenden Webb took the goldenest of somberos, going 0 for 4 with 4 swinging Ks. ouch. Delmarva 11 Augusta (Giants) 10 The Shorebirds opened up action with 2 runs in the first. Augusta responded with 3 runs in the first. Delmarva got frisky again with 2 runs in the 5th. Augusta responded with...3 runs in the 5th. The Shorebirds clawed back 1 run in the 6th before blowing the game open with 4 runs in the 7th and 2 more in the 8th. Just to make things interesting, Augusta put up a 4 spot in the 9th. Fun times.    Starter Brian Gonzalez got rocked for 6 ER over 4.2 IP. Command seemed to be lacking judging by the 3 walks and 2 WP he was charged with. 5 Ks is nice though. Derrick Bleeker took it on the chin as well, as he was charged with the four 9th inning runs (3 of those were Earned). Donnie Hart came on to put the rally to bed and earn his 6th Save. Alex Murphy wrecked shop, going 4 for 4 with a double and a triple, 3 RBI, and 2 runs scored. Jomar Reyes had himself a 3 for 5 night, with an RBI and run scored to boot. The rest of the lineup combined for 13 Ks on the night, though they did also draw 5 BBs, with Jay Gonzalez accounting for 3 of those and 2 of the Ks.

For Machado, he\xe2\x80\x99s probably more comfortable and better-suited lower in the lineup where he can drove in runs. For the team, it\xe2\x80\x99s most likely a stop-gap until a better candidate can step forward.They may find an adequate candidate in outfielder, David Lough. Like De Aza this season, Lough looked like the everyday leadoff man coming into last season, but a poor April at the plate saw him losing playing time by May.Lough\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a poor offensive player was earned during that first month in Baltimore, and has stuck with him over the past year. However, apart from his slow start last season, Lough has hit well when given the opportunity, including hitting over .300 in his last three months going back to last season.His slow start last season could\xe2\x80\x99ve just been the product of his first real consistent playing time at the major-league level, and his production since then could be evidence of his adjustment.It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious Lough is a plus-defender, and his speed makes him an asset on the base-paths. The question will always be his bat. However, with De Aza struggling Lough should get plenty of opportunities in the next few weeks. If he can continue his recent success, he could become a staple at the top of the lineup before long.\xc2\xa0 Next: \xe2\x80\x9dBaltimore.

That signaled to locals that perhaps the situation at home was getting back to normal, or as normal as it could be in the wake of rioting. So all that was left was for the Baltimore Orioles to potentially go out and take two-of-three from Tampa, to hopefully help the city become more whole again.Be they the home or road team, the Tampa Rays seem to be conditioned to playing in Tropicana Field. They seemingly force their opponents to play their style of baseball, which in effect is small ball and pitching. And the O\xe2\x80\x99s this weekend proved that they could do that.\xc2\xa0More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 7 H, 2 R, 2 BB, \xc2\xa04 K. One thing that was a bit of an issue was that Chen seemed to struggle with two strikes. Tampa took a 1-0 lead in the second on a James Loney homer, on an 0-2 count. Chen probably caught just a bit too much of the plate on the pitch. Logan Forsythe followed that up in the top of the fifth on another two-strike count with an RBI-single, and the Orioles were in a 2-0 hole halfway through.With runners at first and second and two outs in the last of the sixth, Buck Showalter was forced to insert Rey Navarro as a pinch hitter for Steve Pearce \xe2\x80\x93 who had to leave the game with an upset stomach. (Sounds like a strange reason to leave a game, but I can sympathize \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there, during a basketball game once.) Navarro swung on the first pitch and lined an RBI-single to left field, cutting the Tampa lead to 2-1.Travis Snider would open up the seventh with a single, and later in the inning Manny Machado would draw a two-out walk. With David Lough\xc2\xa0running for Snider, Jimmy Paredes came through in the clutch with an RBI-double which tied the game and left runners at the corners. That brought Adam Jones to the plate, who was already 3-for-3 on the day. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times over the past few years, great players come through in the clutch when they\xe2\x80\x99re needed the most\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and Jones is no exception. I tweeted this during the game, but Adam Jones isCourtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sportsone of the best two-strike hitters in baseball. So with two strikes he lined a base hit to center field, which scored both Machado and Paredes. Suddenly the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a 4-2 lead, which was preserved by the likes of Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Zach Britton.The win put the Orioles one game above .500, and the fact is that they\xe2\x80\x99re playing good baseball right now. However the story of the day was Adam Jones. There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody who\xe2\x80\x99s consistently put this team on his back as often or as well as Jones. And the fact is that today it mean a heck of a lot more than just winning a game or a series. By putting the team on his shoulders, he put the hopes and dreams of an entire city on his back.As I said last week, the Orioles are very much in a position to \xe2\x80\x9cown\xe2\x80\x9d the situation in Baltimore, much in the tradition of the New Orleans Saints and Boston Red Sox in situations in their cities. And Adam Jones is exactly the type of player to be the face of that effort. Last night we saw Jones make a mistake in casually getting to a ball after a base hit, and he followed that up with this effort yesterday. Great players have short memories and come through in the clutch.The O\xe2\x80\x99s of course are off today before heading off for a true road trip in New York. They did however return to Baltimore yesterday evening following the game, and will board a train up to New York later this afternoon. The good news for the Birds is that once they get to New York they\xe2\x80\x99ll be in one place (meaning one hotel) until Sunday afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game at Yankee Stadium. They\xe2\x80\x99ll have two games against the NY Mets in Queens, and then four against the NY Yankees in the Bronx. Staying in one hotel for the better part of a week isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly par for the course in MLB, but needless to say it\xe2\x80\x99s shaping up to be a much more run-of-the-mill week than last week was for the Orioles.Next: \xe2\x80\x9dBaltimore  ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
05/05/2015,"[('Orioles shut down by Bartolo Colon, lose 3-2 in series ...', "" The Orioles dropped the first game in their short series with the New York Mets tonight, unable to solve the mystery that is Bartolo Colon. They wasted a solid but unspectacular start by Bud Norris, opting instead to strike out nine times against Colon as he pitched 7 \xe2\x85\x94 \xc2\xa0innings with just one run allowed. A Chris Davis homer in the 9th made things exciting but didn't change the outcome as the Orioles fell, 3-2.    Norris was in and out of trouble early in the game, but allowed runs in just one inning. After three innings in which he allowed four baserunners but no runs, Bud was hit hard in the fourth inning. Lucas Duda hit a long fly ball that landed over Adam Jones's head in center field for a double, then two batters later Duda scored on a single by Daniel Murphy. A Wilmer Flores double that hit the fair line painted on the wall in left field put runners on second and third, both of whom came in on yet another double, this one by Kevin Plawecki. After a visit from pitching coach Dave Wallace (the poor man's Detective Munch), Norris retired Dilson Herrera on a fly ball and took advantage of the National League rules by striking out Bartolo Colon to end the inning (his helmet fell off, naturally. Also, the crowd just loved everything Bartolo did at the plate. Foul ball? Huge cheers. Ground out to shortstop? Giant cheers. It was hilarious). After that fateful fourth inning, Bud settled in nicely. Starting with the second out of the fourth he retired the final eleven batters that he faced as he finished with a pitching line of 7 IP, 7 H, 3 R, 1 BB, 4 K. Two of his final eleven outs were more due to Adam Jones being an awesome outfielder and less about Bud, however. Jones made an outstanding catch in the fifth inning (shown below), and another good one in the right-center field gap in the seventh.    Your browser does not support iframes.As for the offense of the Orioles, it was basically limited to a home run by Manny Machado in the 8th inning. It was a beauty, hit deep to left-center field, but it was too little, too late. Colon allowed six hits in the game, but in just one inning did the Orioles have more than one baserunner against him. That inning was the fourth, when Jones and Davis hit back-to-back singles to lead off, then moved to second and third with one out. But the Orioles were unable to cash in, instead getting a strikeout from Caleb Joseph and a ground out by Travis Snider.    Before the game tonight I noticed a tweet from the Elias Sports Bureau:  With a win vs #Orioles, Bartolo Colon would become the 1st #MLB pitcher to defeat one team for 7 different clubs.  #Mets at 7 pm on @SNYtv\r \xe2\x80\x94 Elias Sports Bureau (@EliasSports) May 5, 2015        Welp, he did it. It really has been a long and crazy road for Colon. He somehow just keeps on going, which is pretty impressive. Brian Matusz relieved Norris with the task of keeping the deficit at just two runs. He did just that with a clean 1-2-3 inning, and it's always nice to see Matusz pitch well. Coming into tonight, Mets closer Jeurys Familia was\xc2\xa0a perfect 10 for 10 in save opportunities this year. He is now a perfect 11 for 11. He did give up the aforementioned bomb to Davis on the first pitch he threw, but then made quick work of Delmon Young, Joseph (who was probably relieved to hit a fly ball after three strikeouts), and Snider to end the game.    With the loss the Orioles fall back to .500 at 12-12. They'll try to go back above it again tomorrow as Ubaldo Jimenez faces off against Jacob deGrom in the series finale.

05/06/2015,"[('Orioles lose to Mets 5-1, get swept in the two game series ...', "" I have recapped three games in my lifetime, I am now 0-3. I would say that it's not my fault, but it probably is. Anyways, the Orioles lost their second consecutive game and their 8th straight to the Mets. The Orioles are now 0-5 all time at Citi Field. Somehow it is slightly comforting that the Orioles move on to the Yankees tomorrow.    The game started poorly for the Orioles and never got much better after that. Ubaldo Jimenez coming off of a great start struggled and struggled early in this one. He only pitched four innings, giving up six hits, two walks and only striking out one. He was responsible for three runs which included one home run. The scoring for the Mets started in the bottom of the second inning. Jimenez walked Michael Cuddyer, the lead off hitter, after going 0-2 to him. Jimenez recorded the next two outs then he walked catcher Kevin Plaweicki after going 1-2 to him. Next up was Dilson Herrera who hit a seeing eye single straight up the middle to score Cuddyer from second. Walks will kill you, 1-0. Jimenez then struck out the opposing pitcher to end the inning. The next inning Curtis Granderson led off with a rocket home run to right field after narrowly missing one in his first at bat, 2-0. The very next inning (we're at the 4th inning now, are you keeping up?) Jimenez recorded one out and then gave up three straight singles, including one to pitcher Jacob deGrom. Granderson recorded his second RBI of the game on a sacrifice fly to left field, 3-0. Jimenez got Juan Lageres to fly out to center field to avoid anymore runs.    The only other Mets runs would come on a home run by Dilson Herrera in the sixth inning off of Brad Brach that was first called a double, but then overturned. The Orioles hitters failed to put together any meaningful rallies. They were able to collect nine total hits, two more than the Mets, but only able to scratch out one run. Jacob deGrom looked masterful scattering six hits, walking one, and striking out nine in seven innings of work. He only gave up one run. The only true threat the Orioles had was in the top of the 5th inning. It started with a hit by pitch and then Travis Snider, pinch hitting for Jimenez, laced a single to right field. Then, Alejandro De Aza was inexplicably bunting with one out and men on the corners. Everth Cabrera, the runner on third, broke for home, stopped, and was then thrown out at 3rd base. A true rally killing bone headed base running blunder. The Orioles scratched their run across as Jimmy Paredes singled to right and the runner scored from third. Still, two on and two out. Adam Jones worked a fine walk and in stood Chris Davis. He worked a count to 3-1 and then swung and missed at two balls up and out of the zone. That was only one of his three swinging strikeouts on the night. Rally officially killed and the game pretty much felt over at that point.    The top of the ninth inning brought a little life, but not much. Brad Brach, Kevin Gausman, and Jason Garcia managed to finish the game for the Orioles. The Orioles won't have to play at Citi Field for the three more years and for that we are thankful. The Orioles look to get back to their winning ways tomorrow night at 7:05 pm as Chris Tillman faces off against Nathan Eovaldi and the Yankees in the Bronx.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY SportsThe title is a no-brainer; I admit that. It is difficult to win games when you are outpitched \xe2\x80\x93 not impossible, but not likely at a high percentage. Ultimately, pitching prevails in the game of baseball.And over two evenings against the New York Mets, the Baltimore Orioles were simply outpitched. Bartolo Colon on Tuesday night was about as sharp as anyone I have seen in a long time. And Jacob deGrom was nearly as effective last evening. The O\xe2\x80\x99s starting pitchers \xe2\x80\x93 Bud Norris and Ubaldo Jimenez \xe2\x80\x93 were not bad, they simply were not as good as the Mets. Since they were outpitched, the inverse was true as well \xe2\x80\x93 the Orioles were outhit.Actually, the Orioles put together 16 hits to the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 14 hits over the two games, but the Mets were able to get the more critical hits when needed. And they made the most of the few free passes they received while giving up none.I say that they gave up none. In fact, the Mets only allowed one walk over the two games \xe2\x80\x93 to Adam Jones. With runners on first and third with two outs in the fifth inning, deGrom essentially walked Jones intentionally by pitching around him. There was no fear of Chris Davis on deck. Twice before, deGrom had struck him out, and he made it 3-for-3.The Orioles pitchers just don\xe2\x80\x99t, or can\xe2\x80\x99t, pound the strike zone like the Mets displayed the past two evenings. The Mets are #1 in baseball by establishing strike one on the first pitch, whereas the Orioles rank #29 in the same category. Comparing pitching stats, it is plain to see why the Mets are now 18-10, while the Orioles have fallen to 12-13.Here are five primary pitching categories and the MLB ranking of the Orioles and Mets in each \xe2\x80\xa6StatOriolesMetsERA4.28 = #222.97 = #3BAA.229 = #6.238 = #11OBP.311 = #15.280 = #3BB/93.7 = #281.9 = #1K/BB2.00 = #254.08 = #2\xc2\xa0It is rather surprising to see the one area where the O\xe2\x80\x99s were slightly better \xe2\x80\x93 batting average against. But again, if a pitcher cannot prevent putting extra runners on base and then not command his pitches in critical situations, the fallout will show up in other categories like ERA and total runs allowed. And it is also immediately seen in the chart above, where the Orioles have an 82-point difference between the BAA and OBP, whereas the Mets is a mere 42 points. The difference is walks allowed \xe2\x80\x93 illustrated by the final two lines of walks-per-nine innings and the strikeout-to-walk ratio.\xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryOn an additional but related note, one of the best baseball articles I have read in a long time was a piece yesterday in FanGraphs about Bartolo Colon. Using the game with the Orioles, the writer illustrates Colon\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness with multiple video clips to talk about the two different fastballs that he uses. The movement that Colon is getting on these pitches is pretty amazing. Here is a sample summary quote from the article\xe2\x80\xa6Another thing you wonder about Colon is whether he should be something of a role model for younger pitchers. Young guys always talk about establishing the fastball, but none of them establish it like Colon does. None of them command it like Colon does. Or should I say, none of them command two of them like Colon does. And as Colon demonstrates, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple fastballs, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need a whole lot more.The purpose today is not to trash Orioles pitching, but to rather just simply make some analytical notes about why good pitching is so important and how it works out in even a two-game set. The Birds\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers are clearly improving after their very poor season start.It is too early to totally panic about the season, but the Orioles really do need to get a couple of wins in New York against the Yankees.

Keep swinging the bat, keeping bringing that attitude, keep bringing that fire.\xe2\x80\x9dFor the Baltimore Orioles it was also another day of injuries and roster moves. This time it is Kevin Gausman with shoulder tendinitis. It does not sound terribly serious, but it is neither something we want to be hearing. One has to wonder (and not just with Gausman) if the disrupted schedule has had something to do with this. I think the time is past for fooling with him as a reliever. Bring him back as a starter \xe2\x80\x93 through Norfolk, then eventually back to the Birds. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet anything there will be an opening when the time is right.Rey Navarro was also sent out to make room for Ryan Flaherty to come back, though talk after the game was that Flaredog did not seem to running well. Maybe more on that later?\xc2\xa0 And maybe an update on Adam Jones having some pains from crashing into the wall? An injury there would be devastating.It is interesting how, every year, at the beginning of the season the roster seems largely set; and it is difficult to imagine how even a handful of others will eventually see time with the O\xe2\x80\x99s, let alone something like 45 players. But then it begins to happen.Here we are 27 games into the season and the Orioles have already used 16 position players and 14 pitchers. There will be more; many more.\xc2\xa0Chris Davis is on pace for 270 strikeouts this seasonThere are quite a few items that could be repeated from yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s summary article on the first game of this Yankees series. Among those items would be to again state that the Orioles simply cannot tolerate an 0-for-whatever bat in the middle of the order, especially one that is striking out at a truly startling rate.The Orioles are now 12-15 over the 27 games played so far this year. This represents perfectly one-sixth of the season. Chris Davis leads all of MLB with a total of 45 strikeouts. This is a pace to finish with 270 for the season. To put this into perspective, here are the MLB (not just AL) strikeout leaders over the past decade \xe2\x80\xa62014 \xe2\x80\x93 Ryan Howard \xe2\x80\x93 Philadelphia \xe2\x80\x93 190 More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injury2013 \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Carter \xe2\x80\x93 Houston \xe2\x80\x93 2122012 \xe2\x80\x93 Adam Dunn \xe2\x80\x93 Chicago WS \xe2\x80\x93 2222011 \xe2\x80\x93 Drew Stubbs \xe2\x80\x93 Cincinnati \xe2\x80\x93 2052010 \xe2\x80\x93 Mark Reynolds \xe2\x80\x93 Arizona \xe2\x80\x93 2112009 \xe2\x80\x93 Mark Reynolds \xe2\x80\x93 Arizona \xe2\x80\x93 2232008 \xe2\x80\x93 Mark Reynolds \xe2\x80\x93 Arizona \xe2\x80\x93 2042007 \xe2\x80\x93 Ryan Howard \xe2\x80\x93 Philadelphia \xe2\x80\x93 1992006 \xe2\x80\x93 Adam Dunn \xe2\x80\x93 Cincinnati \xe2\x80\x93 1942005 \xe2\x80\x93 Adam Dunn \xe2\x80\x93 Cincinnati \xe2\x80\x93 168A player has to hit a tremendous number of home runs to make up for 270 strikeouts. And I am not sure that even 36 (six in the first sixth of the season) is enough to say it is worth it \xe2\x80\x93 not in the middle of the order. I think Davis needs to be dropped to the seventh or eighth hole.With afternoon games today and tomorrow, the Orioles will look to Wei-Yin Chen and Bud Norris to keep the O\xe2\x80\x99s in these contests long enough to allow the offense to win it.Next: The common way the Orioles lose a baseball gameMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Whitley serves up 3 homers as Orioles cool off Yankees, 6-2', 'New York Yankees pitcher Chase Whitley hands the ball to manager Joe Girardi (28) as he leaves the game during the sixth inning of a baseball game against the Baltimore Orioles Saturday, May 9, 2015, at Yankee Stadium in New York. Yankees Chase Headley and Mark Teixeira (25) look on.(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORENEW YORK (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Before the game, Yankees manager Joe Girardi said he probably wouldn\'t use setup man Dellin Betances or closer Andrew Miller after both pitched the previous two days.Chase Whitley wasn\'t effective enough to make any of that matter.Chris Davis hit one of Baltimore\'s three early home runs, Wei-Yin Chen won for the first time this season and the Orioles snapped a four-game slide Saturday with a 6-2 victory over New York.Jimmy Paredes had three hits, including a solo homer, and slumping Alejandro De Aza added a two-run drive off Whitley to give the Orioles their first win this week in New York. Baltimore lost a pair of interleague games to the Mets at Citi Field before dropping the first two in a four-game series at Yankee Stadium.""The first one that Paredes hit, hopefully that fan\'s hand is OK because he hit that one pretty well,"" Whitley said. ""But the one De Aza hit, he hit a pretty good pitch.""Delmon Young knocked in two runs to build up the cushion for Chen (1-1), who scattered five hits over seven innings. He struck out a season-high seven and walked one, yielding only John Ryan Murphy\'s sacrifice fly.The 29-year-old lefty from Taiwan was in control the whole way, throwing 76 strikes in 106 pitches. Using a sneaky fastball above the hands of several hitters, he struck out the side in the third and whiffed his final three batters of the day.""He was executing his pitches,"" Chase Headley said. ""I thought he did a good job of locating his fastball. It didn\'t feel like he threw a ball in the middle of the plate. When they got out to that lead, he did a good job of making us string hits together.""A 16-game winner last year, Chen entered with a 2.83 ERA, the lowest among qualifying starters without a victory. It was his first win since Sept. 15 against Toronto.Zach Britton got two outs for his sixth save \xe2\x80\x94 a brief replay review upheld an out call on a close play at first base that ended the game.New York lost for just the sixth time in its last 22.Hit hard by Baltimore last year as well, Whitley (1-1) was tagged for all three homers in 5 2-3 shaky innings. He gave up five runs, six hits and two walks.A rotation replacement for injured Masahiro Tanaka, the right-hander allowed only one run over 12 innings in his previous two major league starts this season.""When he made a mistake, they made him pay,"" Girardi said. ""He was just a little bit off today.""Paredes homered in the third and Davis went deep in the fourth, both on the first pitch. Whitley then plunked Steve Pearce with a wayward breaking ball, and one out later De Aza drove a 2-2 delivery into the stands for a 4-0 lead.All three home runs cleared the short porch in right field.Manny Machado hit a leadoff double in the fifth and scored on a single by Young, who added an RBI double in the seventh after Paredes tripled.Paredes, a former Yankees farmhand, has 25 hits this season, 12 for extra bases.""He wants to stay in this lineup and he\'s doing what it takes,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""He doesn\'t want to go back to all the things he\'s been through with waiver wires and what have you. He wants to make sure he\'s found a home.""New York scored an unearned run off Tommy Hunter in the eighth on an RBI single by Carlos Beltran.TRAINER\'S ROOMYankees: New York put reliever Chris Martin on the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis in his right elbow. The 6-foot-8 right-hander is 0-1 with a 3.55 ERA and one save in 15 appearances. RHP Branden Pinder was recalled from Triple-A. ""Our bullpen guys have been used a lot and there\'s no denying that,"" Girardi said. ... DH Alex Rodriguez was rested after hitting his first triple since July 2012 on Friday night. ""His legs were heavy. I guess guys that are almost 40 shouldn\'t hit triples,"" Girardi said. ""I anticipate he will be back in there tomorrow.""HAPPY BIRTHDAYHeadley made two diving plays at third base on his 31st birthday. He also singled and scored, finishing 1 for 4.STREAKS AND STATSLeadoff batter Jacoby Ellsbury went 0 for 5, ending his 11-game hitting streak. ... Young is 8 for 19 (.421) with four RBIs in six games against the Yankees this year.UP NEXTOrioles: RHP Bud Norris (1-3, 9.75 ERA) is scheduled to start Sunday when the Orioles attempt to gain a series split. But he was sent back to the team hotel Saturday because he wasn\'t feeling well. ""I feel confident Bud will be fine. Just wanted to get ahead of it,"" Showalter said. ""We did some things with our \'pen today to make sure that we can cover it.""Yankees: RHP Michael Pineda (4-0, 2.97 ERA) has won a career-high six straight decisions dating to last September. He has 38 strikeouts and three walks this season, the best ratio in the American League. Pineda threw eight shutout innings to win Tuesday in Toronto.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He wondered why labels were necessary.

He said afterward that his arm felt good, although he could not provide a timetable for when he hoped to start throwing from a mound.Tanaka, who was placed on the disabled list with tendinitis in his right wrist and a forearm strain on April 29, again disputed the notion that the injury had anything to do with his elbow.

05/10/2015,"[('Pineda strikes out 16, Yankees beat Orioles 6-2 - Yahoo', ""Pineda strikes out 16, Yankees beat Orioles 6-2MoreNEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Pineda knew right after he threw his first slider he was going to have a great day. It took a few more innings before he realized how special this start was going to be.''In the fourth inning, I finally go, 'Oh, this is going to be good,''' said Pineda, who smiled and giggled his way through the postgame interview.Really good.Pineda struck out a career-high 16 in seven dominant innings Sunday and Carlos Beltran hit his first homer of the season, leading the New York Yankees to a 6-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.Throwing nice and easy with pink sleeves peeking out from under his pinstriped jersey on Mother's Day, Pineda overpowered an Orioles team that went bust in its week in the Big Apple. Baltimore lost three of four in the Bronx after being swept in two games by the Mets in Queens.Pineda (5-0) matched David Cone and David Wells for the second-most strikeouts in a game by a Yankees pitcher. Ron Guidry had 18 in 1978.''That's as good as we've seen,'' said manager Joe Girardi, who caught both Wells' and Cone's efforts in 1997. ''He recorded 21 outs and 16 of 'em strikeouts.''The 16 strikeouts were the most by the Orioles against one pitcher in a nine-inning game, according to STATS. Baltimore struck out against 18 times overall, a club record for a nine-inning game.J.J. Hardy, who homered, was the only Baltimore player who did not fan against Pineda.''It's really tough to pick up his delivery. When guys like that are on, it's really tough on hitters, Hardy said. ''Very deceptive.''Pineda struck out six in a row, a string that started with Alejandro De Aza to end the fourth and was halted by Delmon Young's two-out double in the sixth. Pineda gave up six hits and did not walk a batter. His previous career high for Ks was 10, done twice.Pineda overcame several major shoulder injuries since arriving in a trade with Seattle in January 2012 and has become the most consistent pitcher in the rotation this year. The big right-hander repeatedly frustrated the Orioles - Manny Machado slammed his pink bat to the ground twice and threw his helmet when he fanned to end the fifth.''They were perfect pitches,'' Yankees catcher Brian McCann said. ''It's not fun facing it.''The Orioles' No. 7-9 batters went 0 for 9 with eight strikeouts against Pineda.Pineda struck out Ryan Flaherty with his career-best 111th pitch on a sun-splashed afternoon, and calmly walked off the field to a thunderous ovation.Didi Gregorius had an RBI single and Jacoby Ellsbury had a two-run double that chased Bud Norris (1-4) in a four-run fourth, and McCann homered for the Yankees.Norris was sent back to the hotel during Saturday's game because he was not feeling well, and Buck Showalter said he managed his bullpen knowing he might need a spot starter Sunday. But Norris came to work ready to play even though he had caught the stomach virus that's been going through the clubhouse.He gritted out three scoreless innings, needing 58 pitches, before the heat and some fundamental mistakes by the outfield ended his day.''I tried,'' Norris said. ''I wanted to go five innings but it just didn't work out that way.''Beltran tied it at 1 on a full-count pitch for his first homer in his 100th at-bat this season.TRAINER'S ROOMOrioles: RHP Kevin Gausman (shoulder) will see team orthopedist Dr. Michael Jacobs on Monday and has an MRI scheduled for Tuesday. ... Matt Wieters (Tommy John surgery) is scheduled to catch nine innings Thursday and Saturday.

05/11/2015,"[('Orioles\\u2019 Return Launches Big Sports Week In Baltimore ...', ' BALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 As the Baltimore Orioles prepared to play before their home fans for the first time in two weeks, the sights and sounds around Camden Yards on a lovely Monday afternoon were all about baseball. Vendors were hawking food, drinks and clothing. A few people were camped out near the home team parking lot, seeking autographs. About a half-dozen were looking to buy tickets at the window in the B&O Warehouse behind the center-field wall. There was one police car visible on the north edge of Camden Yards. It was a stark contrast to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 last game in Baltimore. The city had been overrun by violence on April 27 after the funeral of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died while in the custody of Baltimore police. Then, in an unprecedented move, the Orioles hosted the Chicago White Sox on April 29 without allowing fans to enter. The Orioles had postponed two games against the White Sox before their no-fan game, then played three \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d games against the Rays in Florida. The team said it took steps to ramp up security before Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game against Toronto, but there were no protesters outside the gates before the contest. There were no helicopters soaring overhead. No angry people throwing bottles. No rows of police in riot gear. Inside the stadium, the home team wore jerseys with the script word \xe2\x80\x9cBaltimore\xe2\x80\x9d across the front instead of the customary \xe2\x80\x9cOrioles.\xe2\x80\x9d Once the game got started, the crowd of 20,468 had plenty to scream about. Soon after the fans yelled \xe2\x80\x9cO!\xe2\x80\x9d during the \xe2\x80\x9cStar-Spangled Banner,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez struck out the side in the top of the first inning. In the bottom half, Manny Machado hit a leadoff homer and slugger Chris Davis added a two-run drive for a 3-0 lead. Adam Jones also homered in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 5-2 victory. Monday also marked the beginning of Preakness Week, beginning the buildup to Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s Triple Crown horse race. Track officials say good weather could lead to record attendance numbers at Pimlico Race Course. The Orioles hoped hosting a baseball game might have a positive effect on a city still very much in recovery mode \xe2\x80\x94 and get the week off to an encouraging start. \xe2\x80\x9cWe understand it\xe2\x80\x99s just a game and there are other bigger things going on out there,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles reliever Zach Britton said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anything, the fact that we can come home and play again and have our fans here, maybe that will get some people\xe2\x80\x99s focus off what was going on out there. Just enjoy baseball again.\xe2\x80\x9d The vendors outside the park were happy to be back at work. \xe2\x80\x9cI missed out on a lot of money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Danny Little, who was selling hot dogs, sausages, sodas and chips. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I got a 3-month-year-old daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d Looking back to two weeks earlier, when the rioting started in earnest and caused the first postponement of the series against the White Sox, Little recalled, \xe2\x80\x9cWe were watching the TVs when they were lighting fires and all that. We flipped the tables and all that waiting for them to come here.\xe2\x80\x9d On Friday, the Justice Department announced that it is conducting a civil-rights investigation of Baltimore police. On this day, however, many in this beleaguered city shifted their attention toward baseball. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a nice atmosphere tonight with all that\xe2\x80\x99s been going on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steve Presgraves, wearing an Orioles jersey and standing near the ticket booth. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s definitely good for the city, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be, just a good time, a nice crowd and everything.\xe2\x80\x9d (Copyright 2015 by The Associated Press.

A few people were camped out near the home team parking lot, seeking autographs. About a half-dozen were looking to buy tickets at the window in the B&O Warehouse behind the center-field wall.There was one police car visible on the north edge of Camden Yards.It was a stark contrast to the Orioles\' last game in Baltimore.The city had been overrun by violence on April 27 after the funeral of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died while in the custody of Baltimore police. Then, in an unprecedented move, the Orioles hosted the Chicago White Sox on April 29 without allowing fans to enter.The Orioles had postponed two games against the White Sox before their no-fan game, then played three ""home"" games against the Rays in Florida.The team said it took steps to ramp up security before Monday\'s game against Toronto, but there were no protesters outside the gates before the contest.There were no helicopters soaring overhead. No angry people throwing bottles. No rows of police in riot gear.Inside the stadium, the home team wore jerseys with the script word ""Baltimore"" across the front instead of the customary ""Orioles.""     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: \'Futura Today Light\'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Orioles win at empty Camden Yards, and hope \'this was something good\'Once the game got started, the crowd of 20,468 had plenty to scream about.

That\'s what Dan Duquette does. He lies in wait, like a sniper. Someone will wander into his sights eventually. A random move like that does have consequences, which, in this case, were to transfer Matt Wieters to the 60-day disabled list to open a place on the 40-man roster for Rondon.    There was little risk in making that move because Wieters obviously wasn\'t going to be ready after 15 days and whenever he does come off the disabled list, that probably means Ryan Lavarnway is getting removed from the 40-man roster anyway. The move means that the earliest Wieters can rejoin the team is June 4. Given his progress, or lack of progress, so far, even that date seemed like it might be ambitious. However, Orioles manager Buck Showalter\xc2\xa0told reporters before Tuesday\'s game that he expects Wieters to be ready in time for that June 4 date. That\'s a little bit more than three weeks from today. It\'s a bold prediction considering that Wieters\' current rehab progress is\xc2\xa0catching every other day in extended spring training games in Sarasota. The next step is back-to-back days but he is not there yet, according to the report.    What would it take for him to go from there to ready to catch MLB games by June 4? Perhaps once he\'s eased back into the workload without any problems, there won\'t be much farther for him to go, really just getting himself ready for game speed and facing live pitching again. That last part proved to be a challenge in spring training as Wieters was hitless in DH-only action before getting shut down after attempting to resume catching. June 4, perhaps not coincidentally, is nearly one full year after Wieters\' Tommy John surgery. It seems all that hopeful stuff about position players returning from the surgery sooner was just a lot of hopeful stuff with no grounding in reality - or at least not in Wieters\' case. The Orioles have weathered his absence okay for the last month and they can surely make it another month before he is back. A vague date for when Wieters might go out on rehab assignment is that he\xc2\xa0""could go on one next week"". Even after he\'s back, the Orioles may have the ability to ease him back into MLB action since, fortunately, Caleb Joseph has performed well enough that they don\'t immediately have to have Wieters catching five days a week.

The second Tuesday of the month is always a full-evening board meeting, and all I can do is sneak a look here and there at summaries on the phone.Reading about it later confirmed what was obvious from my scant peaks at the game periodically. I did not need to read anything other than the box score to see that defensive lapses killed the Orioles.As good as the Orioles were in all components of the game on Monday night, they had plenty of stink to go around on Tuesday evening. Fortunately it only counts as one loss, and the Birds have a chance to win the series tonight.Today is the 13th of the month, but for the Baltimore Orioles all the bad luck seemed to happen a day early. Ryan Flaherty joins the substantial squad on the DL.\xc2\xa0 Top prospect Hunter Harvey is reported to have elbow issues of concern. And Rule 5 draftee Jason Garcia is suspected of something not being fully correct, as his velocity is down.The latter situation could prove fortuitous for the Birds. It has appeared for some time now that keeping Garcia on the roster for the full season was not going to be easy to do. The word is that Mike Wright will be coming to take his spot on the roster and provide bullpen help.

He was the 2011 third-round selection (#94 overall) of the Orioles out of East Carolina University.Wright would appear to be that player who has grown and gained experience along the way and is really putting it together now. He was only 5-11 at AAA Norfolk last year, but it was his end of the season that had everyone excited. Over his final seven starts, he went 4-2 with a 0.95 ERA in 47.1 innings. Wright allowed 35 hits and held opposing batters to a .202 average over that span. He did not give up a run in his final 24.1 innings of the season, including taking a no-hitter into the ninth inning on August 21 at Durham.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoThe beginning of Wright\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 season at Norfolk is not quite that good, but it is not bad at all.

Rey Navarro jumped high to snare a line drive, and Manny Machado made a diving tag on a grounder to pick a runner off third base \xe2\x80\x93 a critical moment of the game.But the critical player of the game was Miguel Gonzalez, who at one point set down 14 straight Jays hitters (helped by the defense) and registered five clean innings.After seven starts, Gonzalez is now 4-2 with a 2.93 ERA and WHIP of 1.14.\xc2\xa0 He has a goal of pitching 200 innings for this season, and he has 43 in the books so far. The year is now exactly one-fifth over, though it not likely that Gonzalez would get 35 starts \xe2\x80\x93 more like 30 is probable if he stays healthy.

There are also specific sports sites for each professional team and major colleges as well. In addition, there are general sites for the professional sports.Our general interest baseball site publishes a weekly power rankings with summaries of the ups and downs of each team. Baltimore Orioles fans may not like the current edition. It is difficult to argue that the top team should not be the St. Louis Cardinals, due to their great start, with the Royals second. Having the Dodgers third might be debatable. But having been walloped pretty good by the Mets and Yankees, we in Baltimore can sadly see why they would (at least for now) get noticed and be fourth and fifth.The Orioles come in at 19th in this rankings systems. Wow. Just barely out of the bottom third. But before we get as offended as we were by offseason writers who predicted the O\xe2\x80\x99s to have a definitive losing record, let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest enough to understand that their 15-17 record projects to a final total of 76-86.So where would we honestly expect to see the Orioles ranked, based upon how they\xe2\x80\x99ve played so far? To be truthful, 19th is about right. However, we all know that they are a much better team than what the record indicates. We have reasonable confidence that they are going to play much better and be far more often \xe2\x80\x9cin the WIN column\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 as we hear on O\xe2\x80\x99s radio.

I say \xe2\x80\x9ccomplicated\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 though it is not really so by sabermetric standards, and is called the \xe2\x80\x9csimple rating system.\xe2\x80\x9d You can see it in the far right column of the standings.The system gives a score to the number of runs a team is better or worse than the average team, taking into account run differentials and strength of schedule. The Orioles are currently at a positive 1.0, while the Yankees are the best in baseball at 1.5.\xc2\xa0 If you click on the heading, it will sort the teams in each league in order, placing the Orioles at fifth in the AL. And only the Dodgers in the NL have a higher number than the Birds. In fact, the 24-11 St. Louis Cardinals are worse than the Orioles at 0.9, while of course the Phillies are dead last with a negative 1.9 number.

Without doubt, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have had to play many of their games against teams that are performing currently at a high level \xe2\x80\x93 higher than expected, perhaps.\xc2\xa0 But there is no way to put a truly pretty face on the beginning of this season for the Birds. It has been a disappointment in many ways.Today begins the final push of 130 games remaining. Caleb Joseph said that, in baseball terms, that number is an eternity. Yes, but, we need the see some definitive turnaround. And a good time to start that is right now.The Orioles today host the Angels for three games before welcoming the Mariners for three from Tuesday to Thursday. The Tuesday game is also the first of 21 games played over a 20-day period. A total of 14 of the next 17 games will be played in the friendly confines of Camden Yards.So NOW is indeed the time to make some moves and get back to playing well above .500 baseball.

Yep.The good news in all that is that the Orioles lie only three games under .500, and probably only four games out of first place.The rest of the AL East isn\xe2\x80\x99t faring any better.The New York Yankees are currently in first, but the team\xe2\x80\x99s pitching is surviving on smoke and mirrors. Masahiro Tanaka is on the DL, and if he comes back, there is no guarantee he will be able to stay healthy. Chase Whiteley might need Tommy John surgery. Michael Pineda got shelled last night. C.C.

Dickey has looked like he might be washed up. Jose Bautista is hurt, thanks to his antics trying to throw out Delmon Young at first base. Edwin Encarnacion has the home runs, but the rest of his stats are down.So, while the Orioles are last, their problems look minor compared to those in the division. The Orioles have started slowly for several years now. Last year they were around .500 at the end of May. The division is more competitive this year for sure. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like anyone is running away with the division.But, so far the Orioles just need to put a few things together. They keep getting good pitching, but no hitting. Or maybe it is the other way around.

Frederick didn't get many chances in the game, with only three at-bats coming with runners in scoring position. They collected two hits in three of those at-bats, though. That'll do.

And that is good.Evidenced particularly in\xc2\xa0their recent games against the Los Angeles Angels, the Orioles were very aggressive at the plate. However, their aggressive approach did not ultimately help.The O\xe2\x80\x99s combined for 22 strikeouts during the series with the Angels. LA was\xc2\xa0able to do this because they took advantage of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 strength by turning it into their weakness.Los Angeles mixed up their pitches with fast balls and off-speed pitches, keeping the Orioles guessing most of the series.

The Orioles won 3-0. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles got a much-needed win on Sunday in front of a large crowd at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.\xc2\xa0 The offense was still quiet, but three runs was enough for Mike Wright.Yes, that is right, Mike Wright. A guy not considered one of the O\xe2\x80\x99s top pitching prospects. He took the mound Sunday in place of an ailing Bud Norris and an injured Chris Tillman.And he was spectacular. His first career strikeout was none other than arguably the best player in the game, Mike Trout.He did not walk a batter. He got into two jams, in the fourth and seventh innings, and got big ground balls to help him out of it. He went 7 1/3 innings, allowing just four hits and getting his first career win.Eventually, the conversation will need to be had about whether Wright should stay in the majors. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to hold my thoughts on that until tomorrow. Tonight, I think this win is an important reminder of how far this team has come.Prior to Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter taking over, the Orioles were a team that often rushed starters to the majors. The names, between 2005 and 2010 of pitchers who started several games in a season for the Orioles before the age of 25 includes Brad Bergesen, Brian Matusz, Zach Britton, Jake Arrieta, Chris Tillman, Garrett Olson, Radhames Liz, Adam Loewen, Hayden Penn, John Maine and David Hernandez.In 2010, the year Buck arrived, Arrieta, Tillman, Bergesen, Hernandez and Matusz had 97 of the Orioles 161 starts. None had a winning record. None had an ERA below 4.30 (Matusz).Bergesen flamed out in Arizona, after some bad luck in Baltimore caused injuries to derail his career. Arrieta was the O\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Day starter at one point, but just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put it together in Baltimore. Now, he is a top of the line starter for the Chicago Cubs, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t a surprise considering the ability he flashed in Baltimore.Olson left Baltimore, went to Seattle and then Pittsburgh, but never made anything of his career. Radhames Liz is now in Pittsburgh, an important cog in their bullpen. Loewen and Penn, two prized pitchers, never were successful in the majors.John Maine left Baltimore for the Mets, where he was a decent pitcher for several years. Hernandez was a key piece of the Diamondbacks\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen, but has spent the last season plus recovering from Tommy John surgery.Then there is Matusz, Britton and Tillman. Matusz and Britton found their roles in the bullpen, and Tillman, who was rushed along at the tender age of 21, has taken his lumps to become Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s best pitcher.Now, the Orioles run the team in a way that maintains the team\xe2\x80\x99s and the players\xe2\x80\x99 best interest in mind. Kevin Gausman is going to be starting in Norfolk, despite possibly being a better pitcher than some members on the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 roster, to make sure he is ready to start. Dylan Bundy is slowly moving along after his surgery.Players like Mike Wright, Tyler Wilson, Steve Johnson all are succeeding in the minor leagues.

Mind you, this is literally just an idea off the top of my head \xe2\x80\x93 so work with me here! Over the course of the past ten years or so,\xc2\xa0we\xe2\x80\x99ve started seeing teams have their minor league affiliates closer to them. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 triple-A team was the Rochester Red Wings forever and ever. Then for a short period it was Ottawa, and now of course it\xe2\x80\x99s Norfolk.The O\xe2\x80\x99s of course have had Frederick (which is close) for some time, and Bowie since their inception as well. But triple-A traditionally wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as close as it is now. And the same is true of quite a few franchises, which makes it very easy to call guys up or send them down as needed.But when teams go on these road trips which are long and/or far, if anything they\xe2\x80\x99re at a disadvantage as opposed to their opponent. One might argue that these things work themselves out when and if the roles are reversed, however that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point. If an injury occurs or a roster move needs to be made, a team such as the Orioles might find themselves in a pickle if they\xe2\x80\x99re in a place such as Oakland or Seattle.So perhaps it would pay to allow teams to perhaps expand their rostersCourtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY Sportsunofficially when they go on these trips. By unofficially, I mean that perhaps one pitcher and one position player could be placed on a taxi squad of sorts during road trips of great distance or time. In effect, these players would be available to be formally called up in a pinch if the club finds itself in an emergency situation.One might argue that anyone in the minors is in theory available at anytime in a pinch. But again, if the O\xe2\x80\x99s are on the west coast and in need of some bullpen support for whatever reason as soon as today, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost an impossibility for the team to get someone from Norfolk to wherever the O\xe2\x80\x99s are in time.This sounds like a pretty far-fetched idea for sure, and I\xe2\x80\x99m the first one to admit that. However in an age where the commissioner is willing to discuss shortening the season among other things, is it really that far out there? Mind you that I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about a simple road trip to New York or Boston in saying this. It\xe2\x80\x99s something that would be justified for a club like the O\xe2\x80\x99s when they head out to the west coast for a week-and-a-half (or a club like Seattle when they\xe2\x80\x99re on the east coast). For a team like the ChiSox or Chicago Cubs, when it could be justified when they play three series road trips \xe2\x80\x93 or something along those lines.It\xe2\x80\x99s just an idea, however it\xe2\x80\x99s one that I presume would be popular among managers and GM\xe2\x80\x99s. No team wants to have to play with a short bench for a game just because a guy can\xe2\x80\x99t get a cross-country flight before tomorrow, or something along those lines. Furthermore, it would give teams a chance at letting their top prospects be with the big league club for a period, even if they aren\xe2\x80\x99t formally on the roster. Guys could sit in the bullpen or in the dugout, and get the feel of how things run in the big leagues. Mike Wright sat in the \xe2\x80\x98pen for four games before getting his first start on Sunday \xe2\x80\x93 and we saw how that went.The Orioles open the aforementioned three-game set with Seattle this evening at Camden Yards. Miguel Gonzalez will be on the mound for the Birds, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s Taijuan Walker. This will also be the return of Nelson Cruz to Camden Yards, this time of course as a visitor. My hope is that he\xe2\x80\x99s well received by Orioles fans this week; he gave Baltimore everything he had last year and then some.

Steinbrenner Field. Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY SportsWith the Baltimore Orioles now calling up their current top pitching prospects Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson, perhaps you are a bit like me and get these two players confused. Unless you are an O\xe2\x80\x99s fan who lives near and attends one of the affiliates and has seen both of these players pitch, all we have personally experienced of them are a few televised innings in spring training. Add to this that both of them have last names beginning with a \xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 it can sort of run together in the mind.But we are apparently going to see both of these players pitching some innings in the coming week or two. Bud Norris has been put on the disabled list \xe2\x80\x93 a move that I certainly applaud. He was having enough troubles in 2015 before getting sick and losing weight, etc. There is nothing good about the entire situation. The wisest move right now is to let him get his health back and essentially make a new start on the season with some rehab games in the minors.If all goes well for Norris, perhaps he can be a contributing factor in the second half of the year. At 16-19, the Orioles can\xe2\x80\x99t just be throwing him out there because they are paying him a lot of money. They need to win, and there are other options, at least for now, that give them better chances to get back to the top of the AL East.Mike Wright \xe2\x80\x93 3rd round choice in 2011from East CarolinaAny way you look at it, Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 7.1 innings of shutout baseball was an impressive start for Wright. Obviously he can\xe2\x80\x99t do that every time out, and there were a few \xe2\x80\x9cnear misses\xe2\x80\x9d on Sunday that could have broken through with a run or two for the Angels. But the guy was good \xe2\x80\xa6 very, very good.A year ago at this time Mike Wright was not pitching well at all for the Norfolk Tides. In a series of seven games from May 11 through June 17, he gave up 4,7,5,5,7,4,4 earned runs. It was an ERA over that stretch of 11.44.But, as he had done as well at AA, Wright turned this around for the end of the season. In his final seven games (and 47.1 innings), his ERA was 0.95. He only allowed 35 hits, while striking out 37.For the first six games of this 2015 season at Norfolk, though he gave up a few more runs than the end of 2014, his ratio of relatively few hits and high strikeouts was much the same.Combining these stats of the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 Wright\xe2\x80\x99s most recent series of 13 starts from 7/25/14 through 5/8/15 \xe2\x80\x93 he has thrown 78 innings and only given up 60 hits while striking out 67. And there were only 15 walks in those 78 innings. Altogether, it comes out to an ERA of 1.62 and WHIP of 0.962!The entire picture would seem to present a fellow who struggled with inconsistency over a three-year period, but who has learned and figured out a successful pitching plan to have success. Why not put him out there and prove that he can\xe2\x80\x99t do it successfully in the big leagues?\xc2\xa0 He has control, plus pitches, and upper 90s velocity. It is a winning combination.Tyler Wilson \xe2\x80\x93 10th round choice in 2011 from VirginiaWilson is currently 2-4 with a 3.43 ERA for the Tides. Batters are hitting .273 off him, while he has a WHIP of 1.22.\xc2\xa0 So this is not bad, but neither is it \xe2\x80\x9clights out\xe2\x80\x9d stats.

At Norfolk, he was 4-3 with a slightly lower 3.60 ERA, so that is very consistent overall.All 95 of his minor league games have been as a starting pitcher, but he will have to work out of the bullpen for the Orioles.

So, thanks to the Yankees losing five of their last six, the Orioles actually moved half a game up in the standings, even though they lost two of three to the Angels. I\'ll take it. But that Angels series was weird. For one, that was the first time all season O\'s starters have all gone at least 7IP in a series. You\'d think that would be a formula for success, but in the two losses, they couldn\'t get a single hit with a runner in scoring position. On Saturday they didn\'t even get anyone into scoring position for the third time this year (they lost all three).    It certainly seems like at times this year, certain parts of the team have come together while others have struggled. If you break the game down into pitching, offense, and defense at times one or even two of those parts have worked while the other struggled so mightily it resulted in a loss. I decided to break those components down into some very simple metrics that have nothing to do with how many runs were scored or allowed, because we all know scoring five runs is useless when you give up six and allowing one run is useless when you score zero. Overall, the O\'s winning percentage is .457. In games where the starter has gone at least six innings, that goes up to .631. Have a starter go six innings AND get a hit with a runner in scoring position? That goes to .750. And if you combine those first two with the defense committing no more than one error? That combination has happened 13 times this season and they\'ve won 11 of those games for a winning percentage of .846. The O\'s were only able to accomplish all three of those (fairly low bars to be honest) once against the Angels...on Sunday when they won. Admittedly, this is a fairly inconsequential analysis - but I think it does suggest that maybe winning isn\'t about dominating in all areas, it\'s just about doing enough in every area so that when you do get a dominate performance from your offense or your pitching, its enough to put you over the top. Seattle is in a pretty similar situation to Baltimore. They\'re 17-20, in third place in their division and 7.5 games behind the Astros. Despite Nelson Cruz and his MLB leading 15 home runs, they rank second to last in the AL in runs per game at 3.78. It\'s definitely a feast or famine offense... they have three guys with an OPS+ above 110 and four guys with an OPS+ below 90, with a couple guys in the middle. One of their non-performers is Austin Jackson, who\'s currently on the DL. Even though Jackson hasn\'t been great, his replacements have been worse. These guys had hopes of winning a division title this year, but so far don\'t even look like they could contend for a wild card - so naturally, I\'m worried about them coming to Baltimore.    Pitching Matchups: Note: As we found out over the weekend - this section is subject to change    Tuesday: Miguel Gonzalez vs. Taijuan Walker After a dominating start against the Blue Jays last week, Gonzalez is now one of three Orioles pitchers in the rotation \xc2\xa0with an ERA under 3.00. The guy has just been good, with only two bad starts on the season out of the seven he\'s made. I looked through his career splits, to see if there\'s any kind of weakness we should worry about, but there\'s isn\'t. Lefties/Righties, Home/Away, Day/Night - he\'s very consistent dealing with all of them. One slightly off-normal thing about this start is that because of the team\'s days off the past week, he\'ll be pitching with five days of rest instead of the normal four but he seems to do better in that situation anyway. Ironically, the injured Austin Jackson seems to be the would-be matchup that\'s given him the most trouble, but without him that honor falls to Nelson Cruz who\'s 2 for 8. Taijuan Walker has been a different story. In seven starts, he\'s 1-4 with a 7.22 ERA. He\'s only gone six innings or more in two of those starts and has only had one good start this year at Texas. The guy is young and does have a slight platoon problem with left-handed batters. This will be his first career start against the Orioles.    Wednesday: Wei-Yin Chen vs. Roenis Elias Elias is a little older than Walker, but has about as much experience. He\'s pitched better though and is 0-1 through four starts with a 3.24 ERA. He has yet to get through a start without giving up an earned run though, and has a very high home run to fly ball ratio of 13.3% on the year. He\'s also a lefty and has given up 17 of his 20 career home runs to right-handed batters - so expect to see Steve Pearce, Delmon Young and Paredes hitting from the right side. He also faced Chen in his lone start in Camden Yards, which came last year. He pitched well in that game, but the Orioles still won the game 2-1. Manny Machado is 3 for 5 against him including a double. Wei-Yin Chen is another one of the Orioles rotation who\'s got an ERA below 3.00 (2.53). He took the loss in his last start against the Angels, but he pitched well. Chen\'s only bad start on the year came all the way back in the opening series at Tampa Bay. Robinson Cano is 7 for 28 against him, but that includes two doubles and a home run. Obviously like Elias, Chen is also a lefty but the Mariners feature a lot of left-handed batters in their lineup and Chen pitches well against them. Thursday: Chris Tillman vs. J.A. Happ Tillman missed his last start with back pain...reports were that\'s been an on and off issue for him for a while. Maybe that explains his slow start to the season? His ERA is back up to 6.34 after the five runs he gave up to the Blue Jays. To me, Tillman\'s only good start this year came on Opening Day. I think it\'s fair to say he\'s been the most disappointing player on the team this season. But, he does own a 6-0 record with a 2.03 ERA against the Mariners. Looking at some stats, Tillman has pitched better against the Mariners than any other team. Maybe he likes pitching against the team that traded him away? Those guys still have to be kicking themselves for that trade, even after all these years.    The Orioles should know J.A. Happ pretty well after spending the previous few season with the Blue Jays. So far, he seems to be having a career year with the Mariners, going 3-1 with a 2.98 ERA (which would be his lowest ever). His strikeouts per nine innings are down a little, but he\'s giving up less walks as well, which has driven up his strikeout to walk ratio. But the Orioles have seen him a lot. Adam Jones is 7 for 23 including a home run. Steve Pearce is 6 for 18 including two homers. But in three starts in Camden Yards, he\'s got a 2.50 ERA and 17 strikeouts...so this may not go well. Other Notes:  - Even though Happ is doing well, the Orioles will miss the Mariners best pitcher (and one of the best in all of baseball), Felix Hernandez. - How can we not discuss Nelson Cruz\'s return to Baltimore? For a guy that was only here one season he certainly made quite the impression. He did very well with the O\'s last season on his one year ""show me"" deal, and both sides got what they wanted out of it. Even though he\'s doing great so far this year, let\'s not forget he did the same to start 2014, only to slow down for a while in the summer before picking it back up again slightly to end the season. But still, April and May were his best months. Wait until the season\'s over before totally regretting him leaving. Or better, wait until the end of that four year contract. - Streak watch: Jimmy Paredes\' hit streak may have ended Friday vs. the Angels, but since he got a walk in that game and a hit in the two other games, his ""safely reaching base"" streak is now 15 games (If only he could play the field....) Manny Machado had a similar streak end at 20 in that Angels series. Prediction: Wow - really starting to regret ever starting this section. I\'ve been pretty bad picking these games, but then again the Orioles have played pretty bad baseball. Based on the pitching matchups and the fact the Mariners are missing their starting center fielder, I\'m tempted to say they\'ll win two of three. But I don\'t have a lot of confidence this team can really do that. Currently, the O\'s are in a stretch where they\'re playing 17 of 20 games at home. So far, they\'ve played six of those and are 3-3. Remember last year when they were barely in front of the division after the All-Star Break and they went to the west coast for ten games, they went 6-4, beating our expectations and it seemed like that told us who that team was?    With 17 of 20 games at home, what record would a playoff team get in that stretch? 14-6? 15-5? Lets\' say 14-6...to get there the Orioles need win 11 of these next 14. Can they do it? Yes. Will they? I obviously have my doubts. So I\'m going to cop out here and not make a prediction for this series, but turn this into a prediction on the season. If they can\'t find a way to win even 9 or 10 of these next 14 and turn their season around now, I\'m not sure how they can do it going forward.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
05/20/2015,"[('Orioles Minor League Rundown: 5-19-15 - Camden Chat', ' Norfolk 1 Louisville (Reds) 4 The Tides offense needed just 13 pitches to strikeout thrice in the top of the 1st inning and that was pretty much all you needed to know about their effort. Christian Walker, Steve Clevenger, and Michale Almanzar each managed to collect two hits on the evening, but otherwise the offense wasn\'t feeling it here.    Starter Zach Davies managed to get through 5 innings having just allowed 2 ER via 4 hits and 1 walk. But he ran out of gas in the 6th, and was let down by his defense. A single and ground-rule double opened the inning with runners at 2nd & 3rd. Somehow, a ball hit to 3Bman Michael Almanzar resulted in the runner on 3B scoring and the batter reaching 1B via Fielder\'s Choice. I suppose the runner broke on contact and Almanzar attempted to throw home, but either too late or off the mark. He would compound this situation by throwing the ball away when the next batter hit a grounder to him. The runner on 2B would come around to score, and another potential out was piddled away. That would be all for Davies, as he would finish with a line of 5.1 IP, 6 H, 4 R (3 ER), 1 BB, 1 K, and a gaudy 15:1 groundout to flyout ratio. Bowie 3 Trenton (Yankees) 2 (10 Innings) The Baysox accrued nearly twice as many strikeouts (9) as base hits (5). But 6 walks allowed them to keep them in the game so that a Quincy Latimore home run in the 10th would give them the win. Parker Bridwell coughed up a 2 run dinger in the 1st, but ultimately settled in to go 6 IP, 4 H, 2 ER, 2 BBs, 9 Ks, with 60 of his 93 pitches being strikes. All 9 of his Ks were swinging punch-outs. Impressive. Mychal Givens came on to close in the 10th and struck out the side, though he did give up a couple singles to open the inning, which is a sub-optimal way of going about things. But hey...all\'s well that ends well, right? Matt Hobgood tweeted of being in awe of Givens \'hitting 100 a couple of times\', which, if you\'ve seen Givens\' arm slot is utterly terrifying.    Frederick 6 Myrtle Beach (Cubs) 2 Luis Gonzalez K\'d 7 over 5 IP while allowing 2 ER via 6 hits and 2 walks. Drew Dosch took an 0-fer-4, but did walk and manage to come around to score. Jeff Kemp hit a dinger, walked, drove in 2, scored twice, and helped turn two double plays. Adrian Marin singled, stole a base, scored, and helped turn 2 double plays as well.

Bierfeldt would score after both walks.    Brian Gonzalez may have been overshadowed by Reyes in this one, but he possibly put up his best start as a pro: 6.1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 2 BBs, and 5 Ks.

A primer on the MLB qualifying offer system, for the uninitiated: When a club has a pending free agent, they may opt to offer that player a one-year contract for a fixed amount, known as a qualifying offer. \xc2\xa0Last year, the amount was set at $15.3M, but it changes based on the top-valued contracts in the league. \xc2\xa0If the player rejects that offer, and signs with another club, the signing club forfeits its top draft pick the following year (or its second round pick, if it has a top-ten pick), and the losing club gains a compensatory pick in between the first and second rounds. This is all an attempt by MLB to bring more parity into the league, compensating small-market clubs who lose top-tier players and penalizing big spenders in free agency. \xc2\xa0It has softened the market for some of the players who have declined offers (no free agent has accepted one yet), in particular players at the bottom end of the QO pool (such as, in recent years, Kendrys Morales and Stephen Drew); the Orioles netted Nelson Cruz on a one-year deal last year because of this system. The Orioles, with a slew of free agents at the end of the current season, looked to be poised to reap a lot of extra draft picks in 2016 for players that they would probably be unable to re-sign. \xc2\xa0A number of the club's pending free agents (such as Steve Pearce, Delmon Young, Brian Matusz and Darren O'Day) don't merit qualifying offers, but it was expected that at least three of them would. \xc2\xa0Here's how the top four candidates stack up at this point in the season.    Wei-Yin Chen The Orioles have gotten impressive value from Chen's contract, a mostly unheralded international free agent deal. \xc2\xa0For four years and $16M, the Orioles have gotten 7 WAR (so far) from the lefty starter, without a single season with a below average ERA. \xc2\xa0Pretty impressive stuff, even more so considering the offensive environment that Chen has pitched in. \xc2\xa0Working against Chen is some minor injury history; working for him is the fact that he pitches with his left arm, and has succeeded even as a fly ball pitcher in a hitter's park. \xc2\xa0Barring a late-season major injury or regression, Chen is on track to get a QO.    Verdict: Receives a QO Chris Davis After a brutal 2014 campaign, Davis is showing some signs of life this year, not getting back to his 53-homer 2013 pace, but at least looking a bit more like the guy who hit 33 dingers in 2012. \xc2\xa0He's still striking out a ton (even more so, in fact), and his cold stretches bring to mind the polar vortex, but there is going to be a big, multi-year market for a 30-year-old first baseman with adequate defense and the kind of pop that Davis has shown in the recent past. \xc2\xa0Barring a post-All Star Break collapse to 2014 levels, Davis has a good chance of receiving a QO, but his recent struggles keep it from being a sure thing. Verdict: Likely to receive a QO, but not guaranteed    Matt Wieters Even though Wieters has never fulfilled the promise of his mega-hype prospect fame (oh, how foolish those memes look today), he looked to be a surefire qualifying offer heading into 2015. \xc2\xa0A former first-round pick; a switch-hitting catcher with experience managing a pitching staff that outperformed its peripherals; a guy with easy power even if his contact skills lacked at times. \xc2\xa0But Wieters' Tommy John surgery changed all of that, and his slow and seemingly ever-delayed return from that surgery has made the prospect even dicier. \xc2\xa0There's a pretty good chance that Wieters will be looking for a value-building deal for 2016, to really hit the market the following offseason. \xc2\xa0A qualifying offer would be an easy out to do exactly that, which will probably make the Orioles hesitate to extend one, unless Wieters comes back in early June and sets the world on fire. Verdict: Unlikely to receive a QO, but not out of the question. Bud Norris Look, I just have to write this part, OK? \xc2\xa0Norris looked like he'd really turned a corner in 2014, getting lefties out better than he ever had in his career and going through two separate stretches where he looked like an ace, even if he still struggled at a few points in the season. \xc2\xa0For teams looking at him as a 31-year-old free agent, he could've been a tempting target, if 2015 had stayed on track. \xc2\xa0Well, it's already pretty safe to say that 2015 is off track. \xc2\xa0Before recently hitting the DL with bronchitis, Norris was getting rocked to the tune of a 9.88 ERA. \xc2\xa0That's not a guy you offer $15M+ to, even if he comes back and rounds into better form.    Verdict: Will not receive a QO.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles looked like the Baltimore Orioles for the first time in quite a while, as they opened a three-game series with the Seattle Mariners with a 9-4 victory.

I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing that the answer is \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9dGonzalez does indeed have the perfect personality for a big-league pitcher. He was not rattled by the leadoff hitter \xe2\x80\x93 Seth Smith \xe2\x80\x93 taking him deep. And after the O\xe2\x80\x99s tied the game with the Mariners, a hanging curve to Nelson Cruz ended up in the Seattle bullpen for a three-run homer. No big deal. He settled down to get 13 more outs without giving up any more runs. This allowed time for the Orioles to get back in the game.Gonzalez improves his record to 5-2 with a 3.24 ERA. Batters are only hitting .204 against him; and his WHIP is now 1.12.A most interesting statistic was put on the screen late in the game by MASN during the broadcast. Gonzalez posting the fifth consecutive start of seven innings or more by an Orioles pitcher is the first such streak in almost eight years!\xc2\xa0 On the list the last time it happened were names like Daniel Cabrera and Brian Burres!Maximizing OpportunityThe Orioles were able to work 13 hits and five walks off Seattle pitching. And when the Birds got their guys in scoring position, they made the most of it by going 6-for-13.This skill of hitting with runners in scoring position (RISP) is an ability that has grown in the Orioles over the last several years. At this point, they are now batting a perfect .300 in RISP situations, second only to the Royals in the American League. Last year at .268 they trailed only the Tigers and Royals.

And what will his play in the latter years of the contract look like? (That was the big issue for the Orioles in not keeping him.)His home run tonight was #16, hit in the 38th game of the season for the Mariners. That is a lot. Projected over a full season it numbers 68. At this point last year, Cruz had hit 12 home runs.Perhaps the cooler conditions of playing half of the time in Seattle will help him maintain more consistency than when playing in the heat and humidity of Baltimore in the summer.As Buck said, it was nice that he came our way; but I for one don\xe2\x80\x99t wish he was back \xe2\x80\x93 not for the dollars given for four years.Next: The backgrounds of Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"
05/21/2015,"[('Top 5 Orioles Fights And Bench Clearing Dust-Ups \\xab CBS ...', ' Inspired by the 17th anniversary of the brawl between the Orioles and Yankees this week in 1998, we take a look back at some of the most memorable fights and dust-ups in Orioles history. 1. Armando Ben\xc3\xadtez vs. Tino Martinez 1998  This is one of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s most famous fights of all time. It was a classic bench and bullpen clearing scuffle between heated division rivals. Darryl Strawberry and Alan Mills portion of the fight was probably the highlight. 2. Mike Mussina vs. Bill Haselman 1993  Mussina plunked Haselman and the battle royal ensued. Another one of the classic dust ups that broke into several different altercations as tempers flared. 3. Manny Machado vs. Fernando Abad/Josh Donaldson 2014  Ok this one isn\xe2\x80\x99t a brawl like the other two but an interesting story line. Manny Machado and Donaldson had words in Oakland and when they came to Baltimore it seemed the bad blood continued as Abad threw at Machado and Manny let loose his bat down the third base line. 4. Kevin Gregg vs. David Ortiz Sox 2011  David Ortiz doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like being pitched inside. Kevin Gregg pitched it in and then way in and Papi\xe2\x80\x99s temper took over from there. They finished the at-bat with a pop up, the exchanging of words then possibly the most pathetic fight between two big guys that has ever been recorded. Ever. It\xe2\x80\x99s like someone told them to fight without using their hands. 5. Big Papi vs. Dugout Phone 2013  After watching Ortiz swing and miss in the fight with Gregg you also see him swing, miss, strike out and then finally connect while taking out his frustration on the dugout phone. Did the Orioles ever send him a bill for that?   var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), ('Orioles first inning grand slam not enough, still beat ...', "" Every baseball game opens a portal to a plane of misery and anguish. It also opens a portal to a plane of triumph and joy. You are guaranteed to travel to one or the other before the end of a given game no matter what. In some strange games you pay a visit to both planes. Thursday afternoon's Orioles game was a two-plane kind of game, but in the end it was a triumph as they took the game and the series from the visiting Seattle Mariners with a 5-4 victory.    The game began with about as much excitement as you can possibly stuff into one inning. The Orioles loaded the bases in the first inning with a couple of singles and a walk. Chris Davis' walk to load the bases came with two outs, bringing the scuffling Steve Pearce to the plate. It's not 2014 any more. Pearce is batting below the Mendoza Line. That doesn't mean he never does anything good. To the delight of the field trip-heavy crowd of 33,085, Pearce's answer to batting the bases loaded was to hit a freakin' grand slam, the very first one of his career. Mariners starter J.A. Happ will never be in the category with Jim Palmer of pitchers who never gave up a grand slam. The bases were full and then they were empty and the Orioles held a 4-0 lead in the first inning. It doesn't get much better than that. A lot of things have to go wrong for a game that starts out with a first inning grand slam to go south like so many birds for the winter. Orioles starter Chris Tillman kicked things off by walking the very first batter he faced in the second inning. In fairness, that batter was Nelson Cruz, who we've already seen punish O's pitching in this series. Cruz chugged to third on a Kyle Seager single and scored on a sacrifice fly by the newest Mariner, Welington Castillo. The deficit was cut to 4-1.    Tillman walked another two batters in the third inning, finishing the inning before the rains came in earnest. It had been a rainy morning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards and the start of the game was delayed by 12 minutes to give the grounds crew time to get the field ready. That rain never really left the area and in the third inning it started raining hard enough to force the game into a weather delay. There was no choice.    By the time the skies cleared and the field was fit for play again, a little over two hours had gone by. There's no chance of having a starter return to the game after that long of a delay. Tillman was out. With both of the Orioles' long relief types, T.J. McFarland and Tyler Wilson, having gotten an inning of work the night before, it was time to get creative to patch together the middle innings of the game. Creative means chucking Brian Matusz from the bullpen to the mound and hoping he can plow through a couple of innings. It's good to have hopes and dreams in life; a life without dreams is one that is bleak indeed. Yet sometimes having dreams means that they will be crushed by reality. Matusz has generally excelled at doing this crushing in his career. In Thursday's case he gave up singles to the first two batters he saw, bringing the tying run to the plate with no one out. Matusz picked up strikeouts of Logan Morrison and pinch hitter Justin Ruggiano before walking .150 hitter Chris Taylor to load the bases. How do you walk a .150 hitter? The Orioles excel at this at times.    Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon used his second pinch hitter of the inning, bringing Rickie Weeks (righty batter) into the game in place of Seth Smith (lefty batter). That's what you want to do when Matusz is involved, and Weeks made the most of the chance, driving in two runs. Matusz collected a strikeout of Brad Miller to end the threat, but the Mariners had pulled within one.        Must Reads    Looking back at the Orioles' 2013 draft Ponce the pick in latest Keith Law mock    After that, the Orioles offense went to sleep for a while. A parade of Seattle relievers set down nine of the next ten Orioles hitters they faced, with Jimmy Paredes taking a walk to break up the streak. Matusz having thrown 39 pitches in his one inning of work, there wasn't much question of him pitching another. Brad Brach held things down for two innings, giving way to McFarland. The BABIP dragon followed McFarland onto the mound, roasting him with a couple of cheap ground balls that turned into base hits. These were the lefties; with them having reached and Nelson Cruz due up, Buck Showalter dug deeper into his bullpen, calling Darren O'Day into service.    Cruz quickly singled to center field to load the bases. Fortunately for the Orioles, they aren't the only team that has creative ways of completely blowing bases loaded chances. Willie Bloomquist and Castillo each popped out on the first pitch they saw. O'Day only needed to retire Logan Morrison to escape the jam. For whatever reason, he didn't look very sharp at all and he ended up walking in the tying run. That hurts. Even worse, Ruggiano took him to a full count before striking out swinging. The eighth inning proved to be interesting as well, with Tommy Hunter loading the bases on a couple of singles and an intentional walk to Cruz. He did not go boom, though, because the next batter was Bloomquist, a crappy hitter the O's could actually get out. Credit to Kyle Seager for getting himself thrown out of the game arguing a strikeout to close the fifth, necessitating Bloomquist to replace him. Bloomquist hit a little junky grounder to Manny Machado at third base which, if you've been paying attention this year, would have made you nervous. Machado even re-committed his ninth error of the year earlier in the game. I say re-committed because the last time he committed his ninth error it was later changed to a base hit. Anyway, his throw barely beat Bloomquist. Barely is good enough. Things veered back towards joy in the bottom of the eighth inning. Davis led off with a single to the right of where the shortstop Taylor had shifted. He wasn't able to make the play. One batter later, the O's made the crucial decision to send Davis on a 3-2 count; Pearce hit what could have been an easy double play ball and ended up just being a regular groundout. With one out, the go-ahead run was in scoring position. Glory was there for the taking. J.J. Hardy answered the call, delivering a solid single to center. Davis rounded third base and Birdland cried out in agony. What are you doing, Windmill? He made the Mariners make the perfect throw. It was not a perfect throw at all and Davis stumbled and bumbled his way to the plate, rolling across ahead of the throw and around the desperate tag of Castillo to give the O's a 5-4 lead. Welington lost his Waterloo. Just like that, it was time to rock with Zach Britton.    After nearly five and a half hours of sitting around, Britton was not in the mood to waste time. He mowed through Castillo and Morrison like you cut your grass and induced an easy grounder to second to finally end this game. Britton picked up his ninth save of the year. Tommy Hunter was credited with the win, now 2-1, for being the pitcher of record at the right time. Next up for the Orioles is a trip to play the Miami Marlins, losers of seven straight. Ubaldo Jimenez and Henderson Alvarez are the scheduled starters for the 7:10 game on Friday.

But Drake is a guy who has now accumulated a lot of experience, and we know he is plenty smart enough to maximize his skills.

The Marlins won 1-0 with a walk-off hit by Martin Prado in the 13th inning. The Orioles had opportunities to score, but just couldn\'t convert any of them. Since the entire game was 0-0, there\'s not much point in me going through this inning by inning, so here are some key takeaways:    - MIke Wright made his second start, and like his last one vs. the Angels, he pitched great. Seven innings, four strikeouts, three walks, and three hits. That\'s good for any starter, but even better for a guy making only the second start of his major league career. Not only that, but he had the team\'s only hit with a runner in scoring position. That hit resulted in the closest the O\'s came to scoring a run in the game, and if it was anyone but Travis Snider trying to run in from 2nd, it may have been enough. Not sure I can completely blame Snider...I didn\'t see it in the reply, but I\'m sure Bobby ""Windmill"" Dickerson was waving him for no reason. If Snider had held up, it would have been bases loaded for Machado. There were two outs, but I like the chances of Machado getting a hit there more. - Chris Davis struck out four more times in this game. I think the first couple of those were looking, not sure if that\'s worse or not. - The Marlins had a couple close calls too that, if they went the other way, may have gotten them some runs and ended things sooner. The first one came when Christian Yelich singled and tried to go to 2nd after Delmon Young bobbled the ball. But Young threw to 2nd (he does seem to have a good arm) and Yelich came off the bag just enough for him to be tagged out. The second close play came in the bottom of the 10th when Donovan Solano, who was on 3rd, tried to take home after a pitch got away from Caleb Joseph - but Oliver Drake (more on him in a minute) went to home. Joseph tossed him the ball and Drake tagged Solano out. It was very close, but he was definitely out.    - Oliver Drake became the latest played for the Orioles to make his major league debut tonight. He pitched well also, going three innings with two strikeouts, two hits, and no walks. After tonight, I wouldn\'t be surprised if the Orioles optioned him to bring up another arm. Not sure there\'s anyone else close enough to being ready to make their debut off the Tides\' roster.    - Another reason the Orioles may need another bullpen arm is Brian Matusz. He was ejected in the bottom of the 12th for having a foreign substance on his arm. I couldn\'t see anything with the shots Fox was giving us, but the home plate umpire came over and rubbed his fingers over Matusz\'s arm a couple times and threw him out. It was very weird, and I\'m sure more about this will come out soon. Pitching for the Marlins around this time though was Carter Capps, who I had never seen pitch before but about the strangest delivery I\'ve ever seen. He would skip off the mound mid-stride before delivery fastballs in the mid to upper 90s. The announcers mentioned how he was actually called out in the minors for making an illegal pitch and that MLB had asked he drag his foot more instead of hopping. I know I saw him hop more than once though, and I\'m not sure if that is what makes it illegal, but to see him flirting with that while Matusz is getting ejected for some phantom substance on his arm was weird. Whatever Capps was doing though worked - the Orioles lineup could not get a handle on it at all. - I mentioned Wright got the only team hit with a RISP...that made them 1 for 10. Overall, they left 10 men on base. Considering how well they were getting to Dan Haren early, that\'s some cross between not getting the job done and bad luck. Haren went six innings, even though I thought he was done after five and at about 100 pitches.    - Nothing before the 13th mattered though because that was when the only run would score. T.J. McFarland, who came in to pitch after Matusz was ejected, gave up a leadoff walk to Adeiny Hechavarria. He then got two straight striekouts (which really makes what was about to happen with two outs even worse). But then Ozuna would hit a single, and they would intentionally walk Giancarlo Stanton to pitch to Martin Prado. I don\'t think that was a bad call - Stanton is the only person who seems to be able to hit the ball out of that park on a regular basis, and I wouldn\'t have pitched to him either. Prado was hitless until that point in the game - seemed like a safe bet. But Prado would hit one to right center field and drive in the winning run. The Marlins celebrated like they had won the World Series. My wife (who is wonderful for hanging in there tonight for a game we couldn\'t turn off) said at one point around the 10th or 11th inning that this was the ""most boring game in the history of baseball"". It\'s hard to argue with that and it was certainly not the kind of game the Orioles usually play. On the other hand though, there were close plays, pitchers hitting, ejections, and a lot of managing strategy. I kind of liked it one time, but I hope it doesn\'t happen again for a while.

And Drew Dosch threw a ball away to allow the eventual 2nd unearned run to reach base.    The offense created plenty of opportunities for itself, but sputtered to the tune of a 4 for 14 with RISP while leaving 10 men on base. Josh Hart has a hit in each game since returning earlier this week, and a 9 game hit streak dating back to before his injury. He also stole a bag. The 7-8-9 hitters of Austin Wynns, John Ruetigger, and Gregory Lorenzo combined to go 7 for 11 with a walk, a run scored, and a stole base.

The Marlins won 1-0. Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY SportsAnother series loss for the Baltimore Orioles on Sunday, as they lost 5-2 to the Miami Marlins, who had looked lifeless until Saturday night.The Orioles were beaten by a team that honestly, looks better than them. The Orioles starting line up on Sunday was as follows:Manny Machado 3BDavid Lough LFJimmy Paredes 2BAdam Jones CFChris Davis 1BEverth Cabrera SSRyan Lavarnway CAlejandro De Aza RFMiguel Gonzalez SPYep, that\xe2\x80\x99s not pretty.\xc2\xa0 After the first four, lots of easy outs there. Now, Cabrera did pretty well, but the rest did not.Lavarnway really blew it, striking out with bases loaded as the go-ahead runner. De Aza continued to struggle. Davis didn\xe2\x80\x99t strike out as much, but killed one rally by swinging at the first pitch with the bases loaded and getting an out at first base.And that led me, as well as several other people I interact with, to lament the lack of options. It also seemed like J.J. Hardy was out, as he should have been used to pinch-hit at some point.So, here are some of my thoughts.1) Designate Lavarnway for assignment and call up Steve Clevenger. Clevenger may be out of options, it is tough to find a reliable source on how many players have options remaining. And Matt Wieters will ideally be back in about 10 days. So maybe this is only a short-term option. But I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of Lavarnway, as he seems to do nothing to help the team win.2) Let David Lough get more playing time.\xc2\xa0 Travis Snider and Alejando De Aza have continued to get more playing time than Lough, despite showing next to nothing. Letting Lough get more playing time would be one thing I would do to shake up the outfield.3) Call up Nolan Reimold and designate Alejandro De Aza. De Aza has not done well. Reimold is heating up in the minors. The problem here is that Reimold is also out of options. so when Jonathan Schoop returns and a roster spot is needed, Reimold could be lost as well.4) Put Bud Norris in the bullpen and keep Mike Wright in the rotation. As of right now, there is room for this. Eventually, that may not be the case. But, I think Norris could be a great reliever (I advocated him for closer in 2014 before Zach Britton took the position and ran with it.)

But, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 roster is so inflexible that it makes it tough.So many players are out of options and cannot be sent down. This includes most of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen, including Chaz Roe, who I am fine with losing.As June 1 approaches, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are only three games out of first place. The AL East is still up for grabs, and I think eventually the O\xe2\x80\x99s are going to grab control.\xc2\xa0 But right now, this is a .500 team. Some changes are going to need to be made, particularly as numerous players come back (Wieters, Norris, Schoop, Flaherty). But, I think shaking up the weak logjam in the outfield is going to be priority number 1, unless someone gets hot.Next: Wright is the Right Stuff ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles Brian Matusz Suspended 8 Games, Appeals \\xab CBS ...', ' BALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Orioles left-hander Brian Matusz was suspended for eight games by Major League Baseball on Monday for having a foreign substance on his arm during a game in Miami. Matusz immediately appealed and was in uniform for Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s game against the Houston Astros on Monday afternoon. He will continue to pitch until his appeal is heard. Matusz entered Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game against the Marlins in the 12th inning. Miami manager Dan Jennings asked umpire Paul Emmel to inspect Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s right arm, and Emmel ejected the pitcher. \xe2\x80\x9cI went out there and told the pitcher I was going to touch his right forearm,\xe2\x80\x9d Emmel said after the game. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where he was touching before he went to the ball. I detected a foreign substance, so the pitcher was ejected.\xe2\x80\x9d There was no telling when the appeal would be heard, although Orioles executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette suspected a date would be set sometime this week. Milwaukee Brewers reliever Will Smith was suspended for eight games on Friday for having a foreign substance on his right arm during a game at Atlanta. Smith appealed the sentence, and has not yet had a hearing. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m more focused on getting through today, try to win a game, and see what each day brings,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said before Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s completely in their hands. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do. But we have to be ready to react quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d If Matusz is suspended, he cannot be replaced on the 25-man roster. Therefore the Orioles will have only 24 players available. Matusz is 1-2 with a 3.18 ERA in 14 games. He has limited left-handed batters to a .185 batting average. Showalter said the length of the suspension probably had much to do with the sentence Smith received. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re basing it off precedent,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cEach case is different; that\xe2\x80\x99s why you have the appeal process. To make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not just some blanket punishment. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to start somewhere and work from there.\xe2\x80\x9d Speaking before Boston faced Minnesota on the road Monday, Red Sox manager John Farrell said pitchers caught using a foreign substance are probably trying to get a better grip on the ball, rather than make it move differently. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think a grip gives you an ability to make the ball do different things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farrell, a major league pitcher for eight seasons. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re looking for feel in the hand, overall command and a grip. I think even if you ask a hitter, they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to say a substance makes the ball do different things. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like scuffing it.\xe2\x80\x9d Duquette agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cPitchers, they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to grip the ball so they can make an effective pitch,\xe2\x80\x9d Duquette said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that Brian Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s intent was that he wanted to grip the ball to make pitch.\xe2\x80\x9d In the wake of what happened to Smith and Matusz, Farrell expressed hope that MLB could do something that would enable pitchers to get a better grip \xe2\x80\x94 within the rules. \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to see an approved substance that pitchers can use,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you take a manufactured baseball and rub it with dirt, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to create a slippery feel to it.\xe2\x80\x9d (Copyright 2015 by The Associated Press.

The Marlins won 1-0. Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY SportsThe word came down from Major League Baseball that Baltimore Orioles relief pitcher Brian Matusz will face an eight-game suspension related to the substance found on his arm in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game against the Marlins. Joe Garagiola made the announcement on Monday morning, coming from his position as senior vice president of standards and on-field operations for MLB.The ruling was not really a surprise, since a similar situation and suspension had been announced just days ago against the Brewers\xe2\x80\x99 Will Smith. It is also no surprise that Matusz and the Orioles are going to appeal the decision.I generally dislike these sorts of situations and writing about off-the-field matters, baseball ethics and that sort of thing. But here are the thoughts going through my mind at the moment\xe2\x80\xa6The problem with this ruling is that whatever he gets \xe2\x80\x93 be it eight games, reduced to four games, whatever \xe2\x80\x93 the Orioles will be punished in the sense of having to play with a 24-man roster. That is the bigger problem than losing Matusz, who is honestly an average to slightly above average (especially against lefties) relief pitcher.It would appear that Matusz is guilty of the infraction. And it clearly is a violation of the rule. But that raises the next question \xe2\x80\xa6Is it a big deal? The answer is probably not. That \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody\xe2\x80\x9d does it is a weak justification, even if everybody does something of the sort. There is a rosin bag out there. I suppose he could slow down the game between every pitch and load up on the sticky \xe2\x80\xa6 take a walk around the mound. Would MLB like that?Brian Matusz is one of the very last people in baseball I would expect to be a blatant, in-your-face violator of rules. I sometimes wonder if the guy has a pulse and if the competitor inside him has much bite or energy; it certainly has no bark.Few people sweat as profusely as Brian Matusz. He pretty much always looks like he just came in out of a rainstorm. He has a very fair complexion, and the overheating is seen in his cheeks and face, etc. I could imagine that this might make for some challenges for him in firmly gripping the baseball at times. Remember how this was a part of the entire discussion in the offseason when it was revealed through his physical that he had high blood pressure \xe2\x80\x93 a family issue.

Others have done that. But nope \xe2\x80\x93 don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. I think he is just a fidgety and nervous mess most nights.Was it small and bush-league of Marlins Manager Dan Jennings to make a deal of this? Pretty much \xe2\x80\xa6 yes! At the moment it happened, you, me and Jennings all had the same number of career wins as a big-league manager. You know what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.MLB probably has to follow through with some measure of punishment, and maybe, hopefully, it will be less than eight games. But hopefully also this opens a discussion on how to be more reasonable in these matters, as even the batters don\xe2\x80\x99t want 95+ MPH fastballs slipping out of pitchers\xe2\x80\x99 hands.That\xe2\x80\x99s about enough of that. Talking baseball, how has Matusz performed so far this year relative to other seasons as a reliever?

This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a reflection on Davis per se, as much as it is on how much he\xe2\x80\x99s struggling at the plate right now. Sometimes a full day off is exactly what a guy needs to get himself going. Incidentally, that\xe2\x80\x99s no different than anyone else at any other job.However as a team I would submit that the Orioles are a bit overly-predictable. One thing I noticed during yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-3 win over Houston was that there were times when the Houston fielders didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to move. And this is something I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed all season long \xe2\x80\x93 and even in past years. Ironically Chris Davis is actually fairly good at hitting to the opposite field \xe2\x80\x93 but only when he\xe2\x80\x99s in the lineup and makes contact with the ball.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerBut on numerous times, both on popups to the outfield and even infield grounders, there are plenty of times in which the Birds literally hit the ball directly to the fielders. \xc2\xa0And quite frankly if you\xe2\x80\x99re an Orioles fan, that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a problem. What that effectively means is that the spray charts show guys hitting the ball to basically the exact same spots with consistency. And it allows teams to perfectly position their fielders so as to all but ensure the Orioles record outs.Instead, Houston appears to have a bit more of a balanced attack at the plate. In the fifth inning of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game Evan Gattis hit a ball the opposite way at a moment when the Oriole outfield was shaded towards centerfield. Had the outfield been playing straight away, odds are that would have been a long flyball out.The good news for the Orioles is that they found a way to change this dynamic a bit yesterday. They got a decent start from Wei-Yin Chen, although he probably pitched better than his stats indicate. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 11 H, 3 R, 0 BB, 6 K. Chen was replaced in the top of the sixth by Brad Brach, who also incredibly solid. Oliver Drake and Zach Britton closed out the game for the Birds, who showed shades of their strong 2014 bullpen yesterday.The way in which the Orioles changed the dynamic was by using the longball \xe2\x80\x93 which has evaded them a bit of late. Over the weekend in Miami they didn\xe2\x80\x99t hit nary one home run. Granted that might not necessarily be a fair comparison given that Marlins Park is so pitcher-friendly. However we saw what a difference it made as the O\xe2\x80\x99s dropped two-of-three.oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dBaltimore Orioles reliever Brad Brach: From afterthought to starring roleMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton Injury Isn't So Devastating2d - MLB: Laz Diaz strikes again - But the pitch was outside, of course2d - Boston Red Sox Coming Down Hard on Racism2d - Baltimore Orioles Zach Britton Out Six to Eight Weeks4d - Are the Red Sox and Orioles baseball's new rivalry?More News at Birds Watcher  With Delmon Young at first in the second inning, Caleb Joseph\xe2\x80\x98s line drive cleared the left field wall and gave the Birds a 2-0 lead. However an inning later George Springer decided that two could play at that game and cut the lead to 2-1 with a homer of his own. Chris Carter would give Houston the lead with an opposite field two-RBI single off the right field wall. Again, Carter\xe2\x80\x99s a right-handed hitter. Not only did he drive in two runs for his team by not hitting the ball to where the spray charts say he hits, but he went the opposite way.If the Orioles can start to have more dynamic at-bats like this over the course of games, they\xe2\x80\x99ll find themselves with more base runners which will ultimately equal more runs.\xc2\xa0Incidentally, you might throw a\xc2\xa0maybe in front of the part about more runs. Houston put 11 hits on the board yesterday \xe2\x80\x93 and they only netted those three runs. Credit Chen, and the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen. Baseball never ceases to give us ironies. Go figure that Buck Showalter would pick yesterday to sit Chris Davis, and that he would start Steve Pearce at first base instead. So with a runner on base in the last of the seventh, Pearce came to bat with one gone.

If they\xe2\x80\x99re going to record fly ball outs, they might as well be loud fly ball outs. The fielders shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be taking nary two steps to catch the ball. If the Orioles can hit more dynamically, they\xe2\x80\x99ll find more success.J.J.

This news is not totally surprising given the relative total lack of production from Lavarnway in the 10 games he has played with the O\xe2\x80\x99s this season. He is batting a mere 3-for-28 (.107).The Orioles certainly expected and hoped for more offense from Lavarnway when they got him from the Red Sox in December.

However, this season the Orioles are sixth in the American League in homeruns, and consequently tenth in runs scored. They seem to be waiting for the big homerun that just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come as frequently as it has in the past.The reason is because the roster isn\xe2\x80\x99t built in the way it has been in the past. Unlike recent seasons, the daily lineup just isn\xe2\x80\x99t filled with the same consistent homerun threats.

He\'s winless in his last six starts and has dropped five straight decisions, tying a career high.To be fair, in this one the right-hander didn\'t get a whole lot of support.""It\'s a step in the right direction for a guy we know is capable of pitching at a good level,"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""We obviously haven\'t been giving our pitchers much margin for error, but he gave us a real good chance to win tonight. Probably even a little bit better than that.""Jimmy Paredes had three hits, but the Orioles fell to 1-16 when scoring fewer than four runs.""When you\'re not scoring a lot of runs, the tendency is to press and try to overdo it,"" cleanup hitter Chris Davis said. ""I think you\'ve seen that in the last few games, just guys getting out of their approach, out of their rhythm and trying to do too much with pitches that aren\'t good pitches to hit.""Scott Feldman (4-4) gave up one run and four hits in six innings against his former team. The right-hander was 5-6 in his lone season with the Orioles (2013) but is 4-0 with a 2.41 ERA lifetime against them in Baltimore.""Fortunately at the right times I made some good pitches and got them to hit it to the right place,"" Feldman said.Pat Neshek gave up a hit in the seventh, Chad Qualls worked a 1-2-3 eighth and Luke Gregerson got three straight outs for his 13th save.""It\'s hard to score on us late when we can hand it to the bullpen,"" Houston manager A.J. Hinch said.Tillman blanked the Astros before stumbling in the seventh immediately after Baltimore took a 1-0 lead. After Evan Gattis hit a leadoff double, Tillman got two straight outs before Chris Carter delivered an RBI single and scored on a double by Jason Castro.""Just a couple pitches beat him tonight,"" catcher Caleb Joseph said of Tillman. ""It\'s unfortunate that they were back-to-back.""Luis Valbuena added a two-run double in the eighth, also with two outs.Feldman and Tillman dominated the early innings before the scoreless duel ended in the sixth. Paredes led off with a double, took third on a groundout and scored when Davis lunged at a breaking ball, sending a fly to right field that was deep enough to enable Paredes to tag up and reach the plate standing up.Tillman walked the leadoff man in the second, third and fourth innings but avoided damage. The last time, Preston Tucker was cut down at the plate trying to score on a two-out double by Valbuena.The Orioles got into a pattern at the plate, too, grounding into double plays to end each of the first three innings.THREE SPOTAstros: For the first time this season, rookie LF Preston Tucker started in the No. 3 spot in the batting order, although Hinch wouldn\'t make a long-term commitment to the move.

Rob Carr/Getty Images/AFP (AFP Photo/Rob Carr)More- The Baltimore Orioles will become the first US big league team to play in baseball-crazed Cuba since a diplomatic thaw, playing Havana\'s national team, a Cuban official said Tuesday. In December, US President Barack Obama and Cuba\'s Raul Castro announced a historic change of course after more than five decades of cold war. ""A clash with the Orioles is planned,"" the director of Cuba\'s National Institute of Sport, Antonio Becali said, quoted by Radio Habana Cuba. The Orioles will play ""this year against our national team but the date has not been set yet,"" he said. The Orioles first string is not expected since they will be busy with their regular season, Becali said. But he added that Cuba\'s national team was still looking forward to the clash.AFP ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles Designate Alejandro De Aza for Assignment', 'There were some that follow the Baltimore Orioles who have been clamoring for a shakeup to the current team following some of the ugliest baseball during the Buck Showalter era and a dreadful 20-23 start.You got your wish today.The Orioles have reinstated Ryan Flaherty from the 15-day disabled list.

Showalter has been searching for a consistent duo to pair with Adam Jones, but no one has stepped up to take over those roles. Evidently, Showalter is tired of shuffling his players and parting with De Aza eliminates some of the clutter of players in the corner outfield.De Aza, 31, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done well in 2015 after having an impressive September for the ball club last season. He has a line of .214/.277/.359 with three homers and two stolen bases in 2015, after hitting .293/.341/.537 with three home runs in 20 games with the Orioles last season.\xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryDe Aza was tendered arbitration over the winter, and went through the arbitration hearing against the Orioles, only to lose to the team. He still received a $5 million salary, a hefty price for the lack of production the team has received this season. That very deal will make it likely that a team will not be willing to claim him off waivers, rather waiting until he becomes a free agent.The move adds pressure to David Lough, Delmon Young and Travis Snider, hoping that one will take advantage of the situation and earn an everyday role. Steve Pearce will see additional time in the outfield now that Flaherty will return to second base. Pearce filled in admirably at second base, but Jimmy Paredes was the Orioles second baseman when they could not use the DH in Miami this past weekend.Say whatever you want about Flaherty, but he is more valuable to the Orioles than De Aza. Flaherty is batting .250/.372/.500 in a limited sample size, but his defense is his calling card. With a team that seems to have an error on a nightly basis, cleaning up the infield is a must. Flaherty is hands down a much better infielder than Pearce, Paredes and Everth Cabrera.The corresponding move should be a wake up call to the entire team because the youngsters have proven that they are ready and waiting in the minors. Recalling Steve Clevenger in place of Ryan Lavarnway was the first move made by the ball club yesterday, and De Aza might just be the second of several moves in the upcoming weeks. Kevin Gausman, Matt Wieters and Jonathan Schoop are all on the mend and should be back in Baltimore shortly. The Orioles are going to have make some interesting decisions.The team cannot be happy with Brian Matusz, and with the recent performances of Oliver Drake, Tyler Wilson and Chaz Roe, the trade rumors might start circulating again. Only problem with that is Matusz hurt his trade value with the upcoming suspension, and that can\xe2\x80\x99t make Dan Duquette happy.De Aza and Lavarnway are likely the first of many moves that surprise us over the next few weeks. Hopefully, it lights a spark in this team and brings back the play that made the Baltimore Orioles the 2014 American League East Champions.Next: Hits and Runs Hard To Come By For OriolesMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles activate Ryan Flaherty, send Alejandro De Aza ...', ' The Orioles\' patchwork ""what the hell, anyone can play second base"" strategy has not been a catastrophic failure to date. Still, it will be good if they don\'t need to keep playing by that philosophy quite so often. One step to that is the return of Ryan Flaherty from the disabled list, which will be official before Wednesday afternoon\'s game, given that Flaherty is in the Orioles starting lineup.    In the process, the Orioles designated outfielder Alejandro De Aza for assignment. It\'s a surprising move in the sense that the O\'s likely hoped they\'d be getting far more out of him than six weeks of a .214/.277/.359 batting line. It\'s not surprising when you consider that batting line and the fact that the Orioles have two other lefty-batting outfielders on the roster in Travis Snider and David Lough. Also, De Aza approximately struck out one million times this season. After losing his arbitration hearing against the O\'s back in spring training, De Aza was locked in on a $5 million salary for the year. He gets paid regardless because that\'s how baseball salaries work. We can probably imagine if the O\'s could see into the future seven months ago and know this is where De Aza would be, they wouldn\'t have tendered him a contract at all. That money could have been spent elsewhere for better effect. Hindsight is always 20/20. It says a lot about the state of the Orioles season that Flaherty\'s latest return from the DL is anything worth nothing or even something that causes a little excitement. Actually, in his limited action this year, Flaherty is batting .250/.372/.500. That\'s undoubtedly a small sample size, only 13 games, but he\'s shown both power and patience at the plate. You might have noticed that the O\'s could use a little boost to their offense lately.    De Aza was hardly the only player on the roster not pulling his weight and, Dan Duquette being Dan Duquette, this is probably not the last person sent to the great DFA in the sky over the next little while. Even if it means a few million dollars were flushed down the toilet, if you don\'t perform, you won\'t stick around forever.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Melky Cabrera, and later Adam LaRoche would provide RBI-doubles, and the Orioles trailed 2-0. Chicago would also add a run on a force out-RBI by Tyler Flowers in the ninth, before the O\xe2\x80\x99s got it going in the last of the inning.After a two-out single by Delmon Young, Chris Davis came to the plate, and nailed a two-run homer into the stands to bring the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within 3-2. However they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t finish the job, and fell to defeat in game one. The eighth inning\xc2\xa0incidentally was marred by Manny Machado being ejected after he was called out on strikes and slammed his helmet down in disgust. That temper is one thing Machado is going to have to learn to control, lest he wants to start being judged even more harshly by umpires.Courtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe majority of these twin bills are split, but that means it\xe2\x80\x99s always tougher if you fall in the first game because that puts some pressure on in the second game.

From the get go, it was obvious Wright didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite have the stuff he had in the first two starts given that Chicago took an early 1-0 lead on Eaton\xe2\x80\x99s first inning solo homer. \xc2\xa0oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dBaltimore Orioles reliever Brad Brach: From afterthought to starring roleMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton Injury Isn't So Devastating2d - MLB: Laz Diaz strikes again - But the pitch was outside, of course2d - Boston Red Sox Coming Down Hard on Racism2d - Baltimore Orioles Zach Britton Out Six to Eight Weeks4d - Are the Red Sox and Orioles baseball's new rivalry?More News at Birds Watcher  However Wright settled down, and kept the O\xe2\x80\x99s in a good spot to win the game. Wright\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 6 H, 3 R, 0 BB, 2 K. Wright also got a little help from his friends, and early on at that. Manny Machado hit a lead off triple which put the Birds in business. Machado would tie the score at one on Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 FC-RBI, before Davis came up for the first time in game two with Jimmy Paredes on second base. Davis hit a ground rule double, which scored Paredes and put the Orioles in the lead 2-1.However that lead was short-lived, as Adam LaRoche\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer in the third put Chicago back in the lead at 3-2. But the ChiSox had already had their moment in the sun for the day if you will. In the last of that same third inning Steve Clevenger\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single tied the game at three. However an errant throw allowed Clevenger to advance to second, and Chris Davis to third. Davis would score on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single, putting the Birds back in the lead for good.Travis Snider would give the Orioles some breathing room with an RBI-single in the last of the sixth, and one inning later David Lough\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single ran the score to 6-3 which was the final. The Orioles did have to use four relievers in that second game, however as Buck Showalter has said on numerous occasions, they just take things game-by-game.So the Orioles finished the day in the same position they began it, two games under .500 and in third place in the AL East. Going back to the Machado ejection in the first game, as I said his temper is going to be something he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to start controlling. This was Machado\xe2\x80\x99s third ejection of his career, and again as I said if he\xe2\x80\x99s not careful he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get a reputation for being a hot head.

As we know, the first series was moved to Tampa where the O\xe2\x80\x99s played as the home team in the wake of the riots which prompted the doubleheader today.

But needless to say, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen Showalter call out another manager like that.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerBut\xc2\xa0this is not to say that Showalter was incorrect in his assessment. Managers have to think ahead in terms of how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to utilize their bullpen. How often do we see Showalter saying after a game that a certain reliever (or even position player) wasn\xe2\x80\x99t available that day?In fairness Jennings is new to the manager game, so this might be something that he\xe2\x80\x99ll learn. But keep in mind that a few of Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s predecessors managed to burn through their bullpens over the years, which certainly added to the records of those teams.Incidentally, Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s not the only manager questioning Jennings. Arizona manager Chip Hale had a few comments as well in a radio interview with former MLB general manager Jim Bowden (courtesy of Clark Spencer of the Miami Herald):Courtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsI\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before: When you finish playing or get into Major League Baseball on the minor-league level, you say, \xe2\x80\x98OK, what do I want to do? OK, I want to manage in the big leagues. What do I have to do? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to bust my hump coaching and teaching and become the best manager at the minor-league level that I can, then get to the big leagues.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s not looking like that track is going to be the way anymore.If anything, that comes across as bitterness on the part of Hale, and quite frankly that\xe2\x80\x99s something that I can indirectly understand. Let\xe2\x80\x99s keep in mind that Jennings is still the de facto GM of the Miami Marlins.So he in effect hired himself to be the field manager as well. In a way, it comes off as circumventing the system. While every situation is different, guys who paid their dues tend to not look kindly on someone who seemingly waltzes through the door and is suddenly on the same level as they are \xe2\x80\x93 and that goes for any industry.\xc2\xa0oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dBaltimore Orioles reliever Brad Brach: From afterthought to starring roleMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton Injury Isn't So Devastating2d - MLB: Laz Diaz strikes again - But the pitch was outside, of course2d - Boston Red Sox Coming Down Hard on Racism2d - Baltimore Orioles Zach Britton Out Six to Eight Weeks4d - Are the Red Sox and Orioles baseball's new rivalry?More News at Birds Watcher  Mind you, this is totally different than what Buck Showalter said. However it does illustrate the fact that Jennings made a leap for which he might not have been properly prepared when he decided to go into the dugout.Some folks might look at Showalter and suggest that he\xe2\x80\x99s bitter at being Jennings\xe2\x80\x99 first win(s); however Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s not the type of guy to worry about something like that. The point is that a guy who had managed in the past probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be burning through his bullpen at that rate. Which of course leads very nicely into Hale\xe2\x80\x99s comments.Again in fairness, Jennings might well end up being the greatest manager of all time. We see coaches in the NFL who are the team\xe2\x80\x99s GM quite frequently.However those are generally career coaches who have enough gravitas to get the title of GM as well \xe2\x80\x93 and they generally do have some business training, perhaps in college.

05/29/2015,"[('Orioles, J.J. Hardy walk off Rays in a 2-1 Friday night ...', ' BALTIMORE -- Sometimes you can only sit back and think, ""How the hell did they win that game?"" That was the kind of game that the Orioles played on Friday night. They had no business winning it, managing only five hits all game, without a hit with runners in scoring position until J.J. Hardy delivered the game winner with two outs in the ninth inning.    Then again, neither did the Rays have any business winning they game. They only got six hits all game, none of which came with runners in scoring position. Steven Souza Jr. hit a home run in the second inning and then the Rays did not score again for the rest of the game. They ended up losing, 2-1, and they\'ll probably be wondering how they lost. One reason the Rays lost is because they managed to blow a bases loaded, nobody out situation in the top of the ninth inning of a tie game. Darren O\'Day, the normally stalwart reliever, gave up back-to-back singles to get the inning started, and after a pitch to Logan Forsythe got out of control and struck him, the pond was full of ducks. It was hard to see any way out of that. O\'Day found a way. As a sold out Camden Yards crowd of 45,505 rallied to his corner, O\'Day sent Souza down swinging, followed by Asdrubal Cabrera. It was a moment fraught with peril. There were three balls and two strikes. There was nowhere to put Cabrera. He put himself back in the dugout. Next, Jake Elmore took his shot. Elmore actually put a ball in play, a soft grounder that got to Manny Machado with just enough time to spare for Machado to step on third base before David DeJesus could slide in and a run could safely cross the plate.    Gonzalez\'s dominance almost for nothing For a while there, it looked like the Orioles were going to waste a strong effort from Gonzalez. He only made one real mistake all game, the home run he gave up to Souza. That was in eight innings pitched. Gonzalez only gave up three hits in the time he was pitching, walked none, and struck out six. That is getting pretty close to domination. Gonzalez did also hit two batters, which may come back on the Orioles as the series continues.    However, when Gonzalez left the game, the score was tied, 1-1. He was lucky not to leave behind, because Orioles hitters had almost nothing going on against Rays starter Nate Karns, either. The O\'s didn\'t get their first hit of the game until Travis Snider led off the fourth inning with an opposite field single. That was actually the only hit that O\'s hitters managed to get against Karns, who mostly cruised through six innings of work. Four of the six innings went 1-2-3. It was a stroke of good fortune for the O\'s that Karns was removed from the game before the start of the seventh inning. He\'d only thrown 87 pitches and probably had another inning in the tank, but it seemed that Rays manager Kevin Cash preferred to go to a reliever rather than have his starter go through the Orioles lineup a third time through.    In general, that may not be a bad strategy to employ. Getting six innings from your starter isn\'t a bad night, and the Rays have a number of strong arms in their bullpen who\'ve gotten great results so far this year. It did not work out on this Friday night. The Rays go to the \'pen early The first man up for the Rays bullpen was Kevin Jepsen, a right-handed pitcher. Any handed pitcher is a good pitcher to face Chris Davis this year, although Davis has been running hot, with three home runs already in this homestand. Jepsen thought he had a great plan for facing Davis, and maybe he did have a great plan. He also made a mistake, and even when Davis is not having a good year, he can do bad, bad things to baseballs that arrive at a certain place by mistake. That\'s exactly what Davis did in the seventh inning, crushing a Jepsen pitch onto the flag court, which was packed full of standing room only fans. The crowd, predictably, went wild as Davis rounded the bases. The Orioles had tied the game, and just in time, because they\'ve yet to win a game this year where they trailed after seven innings.    After the nerve-wracking top of the ninth where O\'Day managed to hold the line even after spotting the Rays the bases loaded, the Orioles came to the plate in the bottom of the inning with a chance to win the game. The heart of the order was due up. That\'s the way you want it to work out. Drama in the bottom of the ninth Things looked even brighter when Snider hit a grounder to the shifted shortstop Cabrera, who wasn\'t able to make a bare-handed play on the slow roller. The winning run was on base with a single and there was no one out. The no one out quickly changed as Jimmy Paredes struck out on three pitches. The next with a chance for heroics was Adam Jones. Would he be Birdland\'s hero? Well, no, although he put a charge into a ball to center field, but the line drive held up long enough to be caught. That brought up Davis and necessitated a pitching change: Cash went to a lefty, Xavier Cedeno, while the O\'s sent in a pinch runner for Snider. Davis wasted no time, swinging at the first pitch he saw. One way to beat the shift is to hit the ball over the first baseman\'s head down the right field line. The winning run reached third on the Davis single, just 90 feet away, although there were two men out. The LOOGY having ended up being a NOOGY (No Out Guy), Cash went for a righty reliever, Steve Geltz, to face Hardy, who was hitless in three at-bats heading into the ninth. That only means he was due. Due is due. After taking one ball, Hardy hit a Robert Andino-to-Carl Crawford special. The ball fell in front of Rays right fielder Souza, who never even bothered to pick it up. The winning run scored and the Rays walked off the field as losers. The Orioles, on the other hand, raced out of the dugout to celebrate the dramatic win. They\'re now tied for second place in the division with these Rays, 1.5 games back, pending the result of the Yankees on the west coast.    This win was Showalter\'s 400th in an Orioles uniform. He ranks fourth on the franchise list, seven wins behind Hank Bauer. The teams will continue this series on Saturday afternoon with a scheduled 4:05 start time.

Three of the four moves I thought should be made.The last one was for Mike Wright to stay in the rotation and Bud Norris to be sent to the bullpen.\xc2\xa0 I think this is still going to happen as well.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- In a matchup between two offensively challenged AL East clubs, the Tampa Bay Rays went on a veritable scoring spree over the first three innings.Erasmo Ramirez did everything in his power to make the three-run cushion stand up.Ramirez threw three-hit ball over seven innings, and Tampa Bay beat Wei-Yin Chen and the Baltimore Orioles 3-0 Saturday to end a six-game losing streak.Steve Souza Jr. and Joey Butler homered for the Rays, who came in with an AL-best 3.40 ERA but ranked 26th in the majors in scoring.So, given a 3-0 lead to work with, Ramirez made it a point to show his appreciation.''It gives you a big feeling that your team is fighting and showing you they support you,'' he said. ''That showed me the team was with me, and I wanted to do my best to show everybody we came here to fight.''Ramirez (3-2) struck out seven and walked one in his longest outing since last July. The right-hander allowed only one runner past first base in lowering his ERA from 6.62 to 5.53.''I am really happy right now,'' he said. ''I cannot stop smiling.''Tampa Bay starters have not allowed a run in the last 25 1-3 innings, but the bullpen was shaky during the six-game skid. In this one, however, Brandon Gomes worked a perfect eighth and Brad Boxberger got three straight outs for his 14th save.Chen (1-4) gave up three runs and six hits in seven innings. It was the ninth time in 10 starts the left-hander permitted three earned runs or fewer, but he's got only one win to show for it.''Wei-Yin pitched well,'' manager Buck Showalter said. ''We didn't do much. I think I counted eight balls we hit hard. Not a whole lot.''Baltimore has been blanked four times this season, three by the Rays. It was the eighth time in the last 15 games that the Orioles tallied two runs or fewer.In this one, Ramirez was just too good.''He was changing eye levels, he was keeping the ball down, up, elevating a little bit, using that changeup and slider right off the plate,'' said Steve Clevenger, who had two of Baltimore's three hits. ''He made us put the ball in play, and we just didn't swing it well today.''The Rays took control by scoring in each of the first three innings. Evan Longoria hit a sacrifice fly in the first, Souza homered in the second and Butler connected in the third.It was Souza's ninth home run, the second in two games.''It's nice to get a big lead and hold it,'' manager Kevin Cash said. ''The guys played really good defense behind Erasmo. A good, solid ballgame on our part.''Limited to one hit through the first four innings, the Orioles were thwarted by the Tampa Bay defense in the fifth. With two outs, Butler rifled a strike from left field to catcher Rene Rivera that cut down Clevenger, who was trying to score from second on a single by Ryan Flaherty.''Runs were at a premium,'' Showalter said. ''Sometimes in a game you have to take some chances that may not work out.''Baltimore didn't get another baserunner the rest of the way.ON A ROLLRays: OF Brandon Guyer collected a season-high three hits with two doubles and a run scored. He's working on a career-best hitting streak of eight games.Orioles: For the first-time in his career, Clevenger recorded a second straight multihit game.TRAINERS ROOMRays: DH Tim Beckham left with a cramp his in his left hamstring. ... LHP C.J. Riefenhauser (left shoulder inflammation) was reinstated from the DL and optioned to Triple-A Durham.Orioles: CF Adam Jones (left ankle) was given a day off. X-rays and an MRI showed a mild sprain, and Showalter labeled him day to day. ... RHP Bud Norris (bronchitis) will pitch for Triple-A Norfolk on Tuesday and rejoin the club soon after that.UP NEXTRays: In the series finale Sunday, Jake Odorizzi will seek to go at least six innings in an 11th consecutive game.

But like Buck frequently says, \xe2\x80\x9cNobody is going to feel sorry for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Lots of teams have lots of injuries.Indeed, injuries are such a large part of the game in this era; and the Orioles have done a better job than most by having organizational depth.Here\xe2\x80\x99s another example, looking around the AL East \xe2\x80\xa6The Red Sox and Rays are in worse condition, and the Yankees are only two games ahead. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say about the Jays, nor does anyone else.So at this same point, the Yankees were looking OK, but not stellar. The Red Sox and Rays \xe2\x80\x93 as this year \xe2\x80\x93 have even more personnel troubles than the Birds. And, as always, the Blue Jays are a confusing mess (which is why they covet Dan Duquette).Here\xe2\x80\x99s a third example, writing about how some of the O\xe2\x80\x99s players should pick up the pace and perform better \xe2\x80\xa6One would imagine that Chris Davis will not continue to bat .237 and Manny Machado .216.\xc2\xa0 Matt Wieters is going to be throwing a baseball today and can hopefully return in a number of weeks.Well, Chris Davis ended up batting .196, Manny Machado would end up on the DL with another knee blowout, and Matt Wieters is still in a state of hopefully coming back soon.More specifically, through the same number of games last year, Davis had about the same average \xe2\x80\x93 just a bit better than this year \xe2\x80\x93 though he had three fewer home runs. But the strikeouts this year are nine more than over the same period in 2014.So again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be negative, but there is enough to be concerned about that makes one wonder if the Baltimore Orioles have the opportunity and personnel to turn it around like they did in 2014.I\xe2\x80\x99m more encouraged about the pitching than the offense. But I am not expecting Bud Norris to make it back to anything like 2014. Showalter believes he will, and he seems to be making mental plans to have Norris back in the rotation before very long. He was not pitching well before this happened, and I believe the health problem is more difficult to come back from than is being portrayed.But overall, there are a lot of good pitching options, even if Kevin Gausman does not become a lights-out starter as hoped for this year. Ubaldo Jimenez has been impressive, and Miguel Gonzalez is just a great TRUE pitcher. Tillman is going to be OK, and Wei-Yin Chen battles and gives the team a chance to win. There is the new option of Mike Wright (and maybe Tyler Wilson), while the bullpen is still among the better relief corps in the sport.

Adam Jones will give us a Jones year. Manny Machado will improve a bit more \xe2\x80\x93 though this leadoff thing is not working out well. He swings at everything close to the strike zone, as do far too many O\xe2\x80\x99s hitters. Jimmy Paredes has hit well, but I fear the league is figuring him out. Delmon Young gets his hits.Beyond these players, there are reasons to worry. We want to think Davis has turned it around. Would you bet on it?\xc2\xa0 J.J. Hardy seems to be behind the speed of the game. Will Matt Wieters really perform better than Caleb Joseph? He might, but I have doubts about that. The corner outfielders have been uninspiring. Flaherty hits ground balls to second base. Will Schoop be back and able to contribute above the low .220s? Steve Pearce does not generally look anything like 2014.It is going to take a number of these position players to once again perform at a level above their historic averages to make the Orioles a division winning team and playoffs contender. It could happen; I want it to happen. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just not sure or confident it is going to happen.Another quote from a year ago \xe2\x80\xa6 in the middle of that article \xe2\x80\xa6But here\xe2\x80\x99s the deal, did you think you were signing up for a .500 team in 2014?\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the deal, did you think you were signing up for a .500 team in 2015?Next: Consistent O'Day - well, most of the timeMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "", 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

Chris Tillman (30) gave up six runs in the O\xe2\x80\x99s final game of the month. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offensive struggles continued early on in their 9-5 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays Sunday afternoon. However, they did end the game with four home runs.Delmon Young began the game 2-for-2 with a home run against the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 starting pitcher Jake Odorizzi. He seemed to give fans a sign of hope by hitting a solo home run in the first inning, but even with a second home run in the third inning, the offense did not rally behind him.One or two players cannot bring the offense out of a rut, but a series of connecting hits can bring some life to the batters. They started to do that in the late innings, but the pitching allowed add-on runs in the seventh, eighth and ninth innings.

The problem the Orioles have is being able to combine good hitting with good pitching.The O\xe2\x80\x99s reached the magic number of four runs, which is when most MLB teams win a game. However, Chris Tillman could not hold down the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 offense. Baltimore cannot put the offense and defense on the same page, let alone the same game.Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game allowed only three runs, but the offense didn\xe2\x80\x99t show up. They will always have dry periods of no offense or poor pitching, but what makes them a formidable opponent is being able to work as a team when one aspect shows up. When the pitching does well, the offense needs to be able to help.The Orioles were second between both leagues in team batting average in April, but were near the bottom in team ERA. They finished with a 10-10 record averaging 5.6 runs per game, while allowing 5.2 runs per game.Even though the pitching gave up more than five runs per game, the offense outscored opponents 112-104. However, the numbers are distorted by an 18-7 victory over the Boston Red Sox. Without that game, opponents outscored the Orioles 94-97, while the O\xe2\x80\x99s scored only 4.7 runs a game. When only one part of the team does well, the result is a .500 or below team.Even when clearing the numbers up, the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 offense scored on average the magic number of four, despite the pitching giving up near the same amount. This reason is why the month was finished at .500. When only one part of the team does well, the result is a .500 or below team.At the end of May, the O\xe2\x80\x99s finished with a record of 13-16. And as I said, if only one part of the team is working, the result is a .500 or below team. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching held an ERA of 3.38, but the offense averaged 3.2 runs per game.The Birds were outscored 104-95 in the month. The pitching improved from April, but the offense disappeared leaving the pitchers to try to win games on their own.The O\xe2\x80\x99s held opponents below four runs 13 times in May, but only won seven of those games. The Orioles were also shutout three times during the month for a total of four on the season.The month of April showed the pitching to be absent, and May brought a lack of hitting. If I spot a trend, the offense and pitching could be on track to be on the same page in June.Chris Davis has shown some life with his bat of recent, and Machado could finally be coming out of his slump. With Matt Wieters returning on Friday, if he can start on the right offensive foot, he could help jolt the offense.The one thing the Orioles can hold onto is that the rest of the American League East is not doing any better. The Toronto Blue Jays are the only team with an even record in their last 10 games, and they are six games below .500.The Rays and New York Yankees are the only teams above .500, and they are only above by one game.

Granted some hitters cover the field in full better than others, however nobody has the entire area \xe2\x80\x9ccovered\xe2\x80\x9d in full.

And when that starts to happen, games can get really boring really quickly from the perspective of casual fans. And by the way, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in favor of banning shifts either.

While he was the only player hitting on Saturday, and his bat is certainly worth keeping, there just isn\xe2\x80\x99t any room to keep him.But, back to Wieters. Last year, when Matt got hurt he was hitting .308 with 5 HRs, 19 RBIs, 5 2B, and 13 runs scored. Many people like to give Nelson Cruz credit for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense during April 2014, but Wieters was carrying a big stick.Wieters also has a reputation of being one of the best behind the plate as well.\xc2\xa0 Both in throwing out runners and also calling a game, Wieters is considered by many to be one of the best.The Orioles have been lucky to have someone as skilled as Caleb Joseph replace Wieters while he was out. And I will admit, even at times Joseph has shown he may have more ability than Wieters.\xc2\xa0 But those times are often brief stints. Joseph can\xe2\x80\x99t maintain the same success over a season that Matt Wieters can, especially not as a hitter.If Wieters can come back fully healthy and contribute, it will be a big help to this team that is struggling for offense. It might even take some pressure off guys like Adam Jones and Jimmy Paredes, who started so hot but have since reverted back to their typical \xe2\x80\x98form,\xe2\x80\x99 and who both have been swinging at a lot of pitches outside the strike zone.Maybe the return of Matt Wieters will be just what this team needs to get it over the .500 hump.Next: Month of May Ends on Sour Note for Orioles ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"
06/02/2015,"[('The Orioles starting pitchers are really struggling late ...', "" Right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez seemed to be cruising after throwing six innings of one-run baseball in last night's 5-2 loss to the Houston Astros. However, after allowing a lead-off single in the top of the seventh inning, Jimenez was lifted from the game by manager Buck Showalter after just 91 pitches. The decision can easily be second-guessed now that we know Brad Brach was awful out of the 'pen, but maybe Showalter was looking at the numbers that show how bad his starters have been late in games.    Get ready for charts on charts on charts! WOO!! According to MLB.com, heading into yesterday's slate of games, the O's had an ERA of 3.69 through their first 75 pitches. But after that 75th pitch, the staff's ERA spikes to 5.55, third worst in the majors.

Norris has been the worst of the bunch and has also missed time with an illness and Tillman has been terribly unimpressive. Jimenez has done so many things great but has failed to finish strong.

06/03/2015,"[('Orioles trade Alejandro De Aza to Red Sox, get real human ...', ' The Orioles announced on Wednesday evening that they have traded outfielder Alejandro De Aza and cash considerations to the Red Sox in exchange for a real human being who also plays professional baseball, namely minor league right-hander Joe Gunkel.    De Aza, who was designated for assignment by the Orioles on May 27, would have had to be traded or released by Saturday. Since De Aza is making $5 million this year, the O\'s would have been on the hook for the entire salary if they were forced to release him. That would be in the ballpark of $3.35 million worth of dead money. The O\'s have included an undisclosed amount of cash to the Sox in the deal. It wouldn\'t be a surprise if the O\'s were paying in the $1-1.5 million range of that remaining salary. Gunkel, the player the O\'s received in exchange, is a 23-year-old right-handed pitcher who was originally drafted by the Sox in the 18th round of the 2013 draft. That is about the round you would expect a guy from West Chester University of Pennsylvania to end up being drafted. He is 6\'5"". We all love a tall pitcher if it means he gets ground balls, which based on Gunkel\'s GO/AO (groundout/air out) rate in the minor leagues he has done reasonably well. In the three seasons he\'s been in the Sox system, Gunkel has been employed as both a starter and as a reliever, though it was in his relief outings that he\'s gotten the best results by far. Gunkel started the year at Salem, Boston\'s High-A team, before being bumped up to Portland, their Double-A team. The Orioles will be assigning him to Double-A Bowie, according to O\'s reporters.    With De Aza slashing .214/.277/.359 when the O\'s DFA\'d him, it wasn\'t much of a shock they were ready to move on. The fact that they\'ll be able to save even a small amount of salary and get a live baseball player in the process is making the most of a bad situation. Gunkel may not have the big leagues in his future, but now it\'s the Orioles who get to find that out, and that\'s more than they had when the day started. For their next trick, maybe they can win a game at the major league level.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Steve Davis: Orioles Cause For Concern \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' We had a lot of people calling the show Wednesday about the Orioles that are obviously (and rightly) concerned.  The question was asked: When is it not too early to start panicking?  I\xe2\x80\x99m am not panicking yet, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to be concerned.   The good thing is that the Orioles are in the worst division in baseball.  To put this in perspective, they are only 4 games out of first, so a good couple weeks could have them in first. The flip side is, they have the 22nd best winning percentage out of 30 teams right now; essentially, they are one of the worst teams in baseball.   Reasons to worry: your best pitcher Chris Tillman is 2-7. Bud Norris, who won 15 games last year, has stunk and is coming off the disabled list. Your best prospect, Kevin Gausman, is on the DL and has yet to start a game. Throw in the fact that J.J. Hardy is hurt and hitting under .200, Steve Pearce, the unsung hero last year, is under .200, and of the guys you counted on to play the corner outfield spots, Snider, De Aza and Lough, 2 are struggling and one is gone.   Things to feel optimistic about?  Well, some of these guys have a good enough track record that it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to think some of them will turn around and play better.  Wieters is coming off the DL and should help. So should Schoop and maybe Gausman.  Hopefully, Jones will play more like he did in April than May.

The shambling husks of flesh that patrol that desolate landscape have represented a collective drag on the fortunes of the team. They are not what the franchise needs them to be. One of those who started the year with the Orioles has already been left to the vultures. His bones will bleach in the sun.    As much of a downer as it has been to watch that collective unit at times, there is an even more disheartening realization. These are the players the Orioles think are the best choice to be on the big league team. If they liked any of their high minors options, perhaps they would have never felt the need to trade for Alejandro De Aza last year, or retain him into this year; they might have not had any interest in acquiring Travis Snider, either, if they felt that they already had the answer in the outfield. Is there any kind of outfield help anywhere on the farm, be it short or long term? For starters, there is not a single outfielder on the O\'s 40-man roster that\'s not already on the 25-man roster. So, if they were going to bring someone up, that would mean making room elsewhere.    Triple-A Norfolk Henry UrrutiaDariel Alvarez It\'s felt like a few years now that the Orioles have been talking about these two guys. Both Cuban defectors who play in the outfield, who were already in their mid-20s when the Orioles signed them, they\'re often though of together, although they are different players with different skill-sets.    Urrutia is not even considered much of an outfielder to begin with. He is on the O\'s 40-man but he\'s listed as a designated hitter. How much of a struggle must it be for someone to be listed as a DH? The 6\'3"" Urrutia is a lefty batter. He got a brief taste of MLB in 2013. It\'s two years later and he\'s still hanging out in Norfolk, where, in 44 games, he\'s batting .271/.339/.380, which is not really enough for a man without a position. More than any other player, it\'s probably the case that if they felt confident in Urrutia, they wouldn\'t have made the De Aza/Snider trades.    What about Alvarez? He is at least more of a credible fourth outfielder type. If he was hitting better, maybe he\'d be more than that. Alvarez has played in 51 games so far this year and is batting .239/.267/.365. That\'s not going to get you to the show, either. Longtime Camden Chat favorite Nolan Reimold has also been playing outfield for Norfolk. He\'s OPSing .751. I\'ll keep on dreaming for him. Double-A Bowie Glynn DavisMike Yastrzemski As we dip down to the Baysox level we find a name that actually counts as one of the organization\'s top 10 prospects. Yastrzemski is ranked either ninth or tenth by the likes of Baseball America, Baseball Prospectus, and MLB.com. Yay, prospects are exciting! Even if, realistically, no team\'s 9th or 10th-best prospect at any given moment is likely to have stardom in their future.    But you don\'t need to get a star out of a prospect to be successful. Even if Yastrzemski\'s ceiling is fourth outfielder, that\'s one less player the Orioles need to try to sign or acquire. The 5\'11"" righty is 24 and was drafted as a college senior, usually indicating a player\'s not much of a prospect. He got some attention by playing well enough last year to get promoted twice mid-season, starting off with reaching double digits in doubles, triples, and homers in 66 games for Delmarva. Through 49 games for Bowie this year, Yastrzemski\'s batting .278/.351/.389. If he keeps that up, he might find himself in Norfolk before the end of the year, and into the picture for the big league roster next spring. Davis, 23, is a personal favorite of mine because he, like me, went to CCBC-Catonsville. If he gets anywhere it\'ll probably be on speed and defense, although he\'s only been successful in 10/17 steal attempts this year, so it may be that he uses speed like David Lough uses speed. In 46 games, Davis is batting .289/.348/.390, which is decent enough and he\'s still young enough to be in the prospect picture. High-A Frederick Josh Hart Really only one vaguely interesting name at this level. That\'s Hart, the O\'s competitive balance draft pick (#37 overall) in the 2013 draft. He is in the toolsy outfielder mold, the kind who has yet to translate the tools into success in the box scores of professional baseball. The O\'s bumped him up to Frederick this year after he had a .586 OPS for Delmarva last year. Hart missed some time early this year with a shoulder sprain after he dove for a ball. He\'s played in 17 games for the Keys and has a .502 OPS. Something will have to click for him to be in the picture, and he\'s really the only guy worth noting here.    Low-A Delmarva There are guys playing outfield for the Shorebirds because that\'s the way the rules of baseball works, but that doesn\'t mean any of them are prospects. It\'s a bunch of guys who were drafted as college seniors. Good for any of them that move up the ranks, but their future is probably not in MLB. There\'s Jay Gonzalez, who\'s stolen 17/20 bases but has a .680 OPS, Jamill Moquete, who has an impressive .869 OPS but is 23, and Conor Bierfeldt, the South Atlantic League RBI leader with 45. They are all outfielders in the Orioles minor league system. They are not part of the prospect depth. There\'s a lot of that going around. ** Other than Adam Jones, there aren\'t any long-term answers in the outfield anywhere in the Orioles organization. If they\'re going to find one, it\'ll either be in free agency or in the draft. Even if you only look at the short term, it looks like any temporary answer is going to involve dumpster diving. Dan Duquette\'s been pretty good at that, although it isn\'t working out this year. None of this means that the Orioles should go out of their way to grab an outfielder with any of their top picks. Get the best player they can and figure out the rest later. If the best player is an outfielder who turns into a real prospect for the franchise, well, that would be OK.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
06/04/2015,"[('Thursday Bird Droppings: Dreading another dead Orioles ...', ' Hello, friends. It\'s not a heck of a lot of fun being an Orioles fan right now. You probably didn\'t need me to tell you that. Six straight losses communicates that fairly effectively. You know the last time the Orioles lost six straight games? Actually, I was surprised to find out it was as recent as September 2013 - but then again that month was kind of disappointing, with the Orioles floating vaguely near contention without ever really contending, so maybe it\'s not that surprising.    Just now we would settle for floating vaguely near contention, come to think of it. Because right now it feels like they\'re careening towards the bottom, back into the days of top 5 draft picks that they\'ll just end up ruining somehow anyway. The last time the Orioles had a losing streak of more than six games, it was a nine game losing streak in July 2011. So let\'s hope we don\'t head any farther towards that today.

Braves trade retrospective: The Nate McLouth trade, six years later - Talking ChopNate McLouth was a favorite in his relatively brief Orioles tenure. Six years ago, he was traded to Atlanta, where he was not quite so popular. On this day in 2012, the Orioles drafted Kevin Gausman.

And that\'s the way it is in Birdland on June 4 - or at least, until something happens later Have a safe Thursday.   ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""Checking in on Dylan Bundy's progress in the Orioles ..."", "" As we all know, Dylan Bundy had Tommy John surgery two seasons ago after a spectacular debut season in the minors in 2012. While there is never any certainty for pitchers recovering from elbow or shoulder injuries, the recent success of Matt Harvey and Stephen Strasburg should provide O's fans with some hope.    There has been a minor setback as Bundy was recently placed on the disabled list due to shoulder soreness. Luckily, the MRI has revealed no structural damage and he should be able to return in late June. Let's look into how Bundy has performed when he is healthy. Bundy has been handled very carefully in AA Bowie this season. He has started in eight games, but he only totaled 22 innings. He is pitching less than 3 innings per start by design. It is almost identical to the way he pitched when he started his pro career in 2012. In 2012, he had eight starts in A Delmarva to begin the year and totaled only 30 innings as well. He has been excellent in those 22 innings, at least in areas where we should be most concerned about. He has struck out 27.8% of the batters he faced, compared to the league average of 18.2%. He has also limited walks, walking only 5.6% of the batters, relative to the league average of 8.4%. This was a concern during spring training as he walked 6 batters in 6 innings in spring training. His superb peripherals have not been reflected in his ERA, which sits at a modest 3.68, mainly due to a BABIP of .356. We should be past the point where we evaluate a pitcher only on his ERA.    More encouragingly, there have been\xc2\xa0reports that Bundy's velocity has risen over the year, from low-90s in April to mid-to-high-90s in the more recent starts. He is slowly regaining his fastball velocity from prior to his surgery. While the temporary setback is frustrating and it seems unlikely for Bundy to reach the majors this season, it does not really affect Bundy's long-term outlook. The fact that he is slowly getting his stuff back and has performed well when healthy should be positive news. Maybe finally, a top O's pitching prospect will be able to excel in O's uniform.

Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsIt seems like I was a much younger man the last time I wrote about an O\xe2\x80\x99s win. But finally the Baltimore Orioles gained a victory in Houston, even if it was by the crushing score of 3-2.One game, one win does not make for a trend or streak. But there are a number of features about this series finale victory that can be received as encouraging. It was a win that was gained by veteran players.And not just the players, the manager also. Buck Showalter got himself thrown out of the game in the second inning. Well, amen to that! In old-time baseball, when a team was going poorly, managers like Earl Weaver and Billy Martin would kick up a fuss and get themselves tossed to stir up their squad. Beyond that, he had a legit gripe about the huge strike zone that got Ryan Flaherty unjustly called out.As I wrote yesterday, the lack of plate discipline and the overly-aggressive posture of Orioles hitters did not serve them well at all. The Orioles registered six outs Wednesday evening by hitting the first pitch, and they also were 1-for-5 when swinging at 1-0 and 2-0 pitches. The fact that they were taking pitches early in the game on Thursday, along with Showalter flipping out about one of his players being unjustly punished for doing so, would seem to be evidence that something has been said behind closed doors on this subject. Perhaps Buck had a ranting session with the team; we\xe2\x80\x99ll never know \xe2\x80\xa6 but I hope it happened.The Orioles only managed three runs, which is certainly not an exit from the desert of scoreless-ness. And they were facing one of the best in the business. But the way these runs were registered speaks well of the effort and of who made it happen.

"", 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Can the Orioles win the mediocre A.L. East? - Camden Chat', ' Let\'s get this out of the way - the Orioles are not a very good baseball team right now. The offense has been struggling mightily, and the pitching was horrible for the first month of the season and has rebounded to simply mediocre as of late. The defense, usually near the top of the league, has been average. The team has been making more mental and baserunning errors than we\'ve ever seen in the Buck Showalter era.    The result of this has been what you would expect - a 24-29 record and a 4th place position in the A.L. East standings. If this was almost any other division, the division title would already be looking nearly out of reach. Luckily, the rest of the East has been similarly mediocre, so the O\'s are only 4.5 games back of the division-leading Yankees. As bad as the Orioles have played, they\'re only -7 in run differential, a number that would normally be indicative of a team right around .500. Playing .500 baseball still won\'t be good enough to win the division, so how can the Orioles improve? We don\'t have to look far into the past to see a similar turnaround - the 2012 Orioles. That year, the ""turnaround"" was a little less obvious - the Birds were 51-44 at one point despite having a -44 run differential, by far the worst in the division. But luckily Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter realized that the O\'s needed to actually improve to continue winning at that rate, and improve they did. The last 70 or so games of the season, the O\'s played like one of the best teams in baseball, thanks to a vastly improved rotation and a re-tooled lineup.    That season, struggling starters Jake Arrieta, Brian Matusz, and Tommy Hunter were all removed from the rotation. This season, Chris Tillman and Bud Norris have had similar struggles. Tillman will likely get an extended chance to bounce back, especially since he\'s had poor starts to a season before (although never this bad), but Norris could end up having a similar fate as one of those three starters. Chris Tillman, at that time still a prospect, made his return to the majors and helped to stabilize the rotation. Perhaps Kevin Gausman could be that guy this time around. Meanwhile, the Orioles were able to improve the lineup by re-shuffling assets they already had. While this year\'s team doesn\'t have a Manny Machado to bring up, they do have plenty of players with positional flexibility, and a returning Matt Wieters. Maybe a random veteran Norfolk call-up can be this year\'s Nate McLouth (Chris Parmelee?) and bring some much-needed offense to the outfield as well. Obviously this situation is different - the mid-2012 Orioles were already winning despite not being all that good, and needed to improve to keep up the pace. Unfortunately, the 2015 Orioles aren\'t winning. Luckily the division is far worse in 2015 - there simply aren\'t going to be two 93+ win teams coming out of the East this year. Looking at the rest of the division, the Yankees are in the lead thanks in part to huge bounce-back years from Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira, and a dominant bullpen led by Andrew Miller and Dellin Betances. They do have Masahiro Tanaka returning, but A-Rod and Teixeira\'s health are far from a guarantee, and as we all know bullpen success can be fleeting. The Red Sox were a popular pick to win the division, but their pitching has been atrocious, the lineup hasn\'t been what it was hyped to be, and they\'ve dug themselves a huge hole already. They do have Eduardo Rodriguez (ugh) and he looks great through 2 starts, but so did Mike Wright, and he\'s come back to Earth quickly. It\'s far too early to call Rodriguez a star although he may end up being one.    Another team that\'s still in the mix is Toronto. Despite their losing record they\'re +35 in runs, good for 5th best in the majors, and are leading MLB in runs scored per game by nearly half a run. If their pitching improves (or maybe even if it doesn\'t), the Jays could make a run and end up at the top of the division as well. The Rays are still in it too, even though their roster looks like a last-place team on paper. They\'ll need Chris Archer to keep up his breakout performance, and for previously unknown players to keep contributing in the lineup, but that seems to be what the Rays do every year. I wouldn\'t count them out yet. The bottom line is that while the Orioles have been playing poor baseball, this division is winnable. They\'ve dug themselves a hole, but we\'ve seen this team improve before just by using assets they already had (other than Joe Saunders). If I had to bet on whether the Orioles would win the division my money would be on ""no"", simply because of the math - the Orioles are one of five closely matched teams. But 85 games could take the AL East this year, and any of the five clubs are capable of doing that. At least we can be thankful that the O\'s picked a good year to have an awful start.

(AP Photo/Tony Dejak)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECLEVELAND (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 A late afternoon start combined with the Orioles\' inability to string some hits together off Danny Salazar made for a very frustrating day for Buck Showalter.Salazar struck out 10 over seven-plus innings Saturday in powering the Cleveland Indians to a 2-1 victory over Baltimore.Third baseman Manny Machado accounted for the Orioles\' lone run on a third-inning homer, which was one of their six hits on the day off Salazar (6-1) and relievers Bryan Shaw and Cody Allen.""With a 4 o\'clock start, you only have about three innings to see the ball well at the plate,"" Showalter said. ""So, because of the shadows and the wind, you come in knowing runs would be at a minimum, then you add in Salazar, who is a quality pitcher.""We all understand (the game time) is about money, but it makes it tough,"" Showalter added.A crowd of 24,939 was on hand for Corey Kluber Bobblehead Day, marking the Indians\' fourth-largest attendance of the season.Those fans went home happy after Baltimore reliever Brad Brach (3-2) allowed a two-out double to Carlos Santana in the sixth, which broke a 1-all tie and plated Jason Kipnis.Machado had two hits and was the only member of the Orioles to advance past second base.""Salazar had his fastball and his off-speed working, so he kept us off-balance,"" Machado said. ""It also was tough to see with the shadows.""Baltimore right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez went five innings, allowing one run and six hits with a career high-tying six walks.

After taking a college outfielder with their first pick, and a high school shortstop who MLB Network\'s crew seemed to think would be destined for the outfield, the Orioles went in a different direction with their second round pick, grabbing a pitcher. Hughes is listed at 6\'2"", 184 lbs., and is currently committed to Georgia Tech. Hughes was also ranked lower than you might expect for a player being drafted at #68. The Baseball America 500 had him as low as 255th. He wasn\'t on the top 125 as listed by Baseball America, although Fangraphs had him ranked at #137. The slot value for this pick is $907,000. This is the second consecutive pick that was, on its face, a bit of a head-scratcher for reaching for players. Are they planning to go over-slot later on in the draft, or will one of their existing players prove to be an unexpected over-slot signing? We will find out.    The last five players the O\'s have drafted in the second round are Chance Sisco, Branden Kline, Jason Esposito, Mychal Givens, and Xavier Avery. That stretches back to 2008, since the O\'s forfeited second round picks in 2014 and 2010. They also had no second round pick in 2007. Safe to say that the O\'s have not had success hitting in this round in recent years, although there\'s still some hope that Givens, converted to pitching, could find himself into the big league bullpen. Of course, in ancient draft history, the greatest player the Orioles have ever drafted happened to come in the second round: Cal Ripken. This is the last pick of the night for the O\'s. The second day of the draft will run through rounds 3-10, starting at 1pm tomorrow.     ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
06/09/2015,"[('MLB Draft results 2015: Orioles continue to grab ...', ' Day 2 of the MLB Draft is where the players who get drafted start having longer and longer shots to make the big leagues, but there is still potential talent to be found if you pick the right player and get lucky. The Orioles made their picks in rounds 3-5 and added players who they hope might develop into big league roles, even if they might not be future stars.    In the third round, they picked Garrett Cleavinger, a 6\'1"" left-handed pitcher from the University of Oregon. Their fourth round pick was Ryan McKenna, a center fielder from St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Dover, New Hampshire. With their pick in the fifth round they grabbed another high school outfielder, Jason Heinrich from River Ridge Middle HS in Florida. That\'s three outfielders in six picks for the Orioles, and one player who might end up as an outfielder. Cleavinger, picked at #102 overall, was rated as the #185 prospect on the Baseball America 500. The MLB.com scouting capsule on Cleavinger has this to say: He has a quick arm and his delivery does add some deception. The effort in that delivery does make it a bit more difficult for him to find the strike zone more consistently. A team that feels it can unlock that plus velocity out of Cleavinger is likely to take him in the earlier rounds, thinking a lefty setup man might evolve. At worst, Cleavinger does have the deception to be a specialist down the line.    So just on the surface that sounds like a best case of being a Zach Britton-type of reliever in that he\'s a lefty with the potential to throw hard, with a medium case of ending up just a LOOGY, which would still be a good outcome for a third round pick.    Also, with the Orioles already having a catcher named Steve Clevenger, this Cleavinger-Clevenger battery needs to happen, somehow. Cleavinger struck out 66 batters in 40 innings as he saved nine games for the Ducks this season. NCAA hitters batted only .153 against him, although he did also walk 17 in that time.    McKenna, a right-handed batter listed at 5\'9"" and 175 lbs., comes from a place where you don\'t necessarily expect to grab a lot of baseball players. The last NH high school player to have much success is Pirates pitcher Jeff Locke. His hometown is listed as Maine, which is sure to delight the Maine contingent in the MASN broadcast crew if McKenna makes it to the bigs. The MLB.com scouting capsule about McKenna says: McKenna definitely has some tools to help him make an impact. He can really hit, with a line-drive approach and more power to come as he matures. He has very good speed from the right side of the plate and is a threat on the basepaths. That speed gives him the chance to stay in center field and he has more than enough arm for the position. He\'s strong, stocky and athletic. With the standard caveat that everybody sounds good when you only look at the positives on their scouting report, those are some nice positives to have on the scouting report. McKenna actually rates higher on the Baseball America 500 (#161) than either of the two players the Orioles drafted prior to him.    For Heinrich, listed at 6\'1"" and 205 lbs., the MLB draft crew recognized him right away as being a player who they described as having ""a ton of raw power"" and being kind of an ""all or nothing guy at the plate."" They recalled a memorable performance at the Perfect Game WWBA World Championship that probably put him on some draft boards. Heinrich was ranked as the #188 prospect by Baseball America. His capsule on MLB.com says: The Central Florida commit is a big risk, big reward kind of high school bat, one with a ton of raw power. He\'s shown flashes of it during what\'s been a rain-soaked senior season for him in Florida, but not with the consistency he showed in Jupiter. He does have the ability to make loud contact and hit for power to all fields. Heinrich\'s offensive profile fits best in right field and he does throw enough to be able to stay there. He\'s not overly athletic, but he\'s far from a sloth on the bases and in the outfield. Not to sound like a broken record, but if it was a sure thing that he could hit, then he would have been a first round pick. They seem to think he\'s got some power and maybe that will translate at the professional level. The Orioles have one fifth round pick (though they didn\'t draft him) who turned into quite a power hitter on their roster: Chris Davis. Heinrich has some long odds to have that kind of outcome, but it can be done. Through five rounds, the Orioles have grabbed four position players and two pitchers.

Miguel Gonzalez is now headed toward the disabled list with a groin strain.The bullpen has seen a lot of action recently, but a lot of that is the competition. The Orioles know that when they play their divisional rivals, those foes are going to take a lot of pitches.\xc2\xa0 The O\xe2\x80\x99s also have shown they are at their best offensively when they take some pitches themselves.

Oh how pretty it was!It all started in the second inning. Xander Bogaerts singled to deep center field off the wall. Adam Jones fielded it with his bare hand and gunned a throw that took one hop right to J.J. Hardy, who had the glove low for the tag on Bogaerts.The second base umpire originally ruled Bogaerts safe, which didn\xe2\x80\x99t look to be the case in real-time.\xc2\xa0 And when Buck Showalter asked for a replay, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t take long to get the call overturned. You have to wonder if the umpire was a bit surprised that the throw was in time.Next up was Pablo Sandoval. Sandoval did a great job of dumping a good pitch past third base and toward the wall in foul territory in left field. Travis Snider, in left field, fielded the ball, spun around and fired to Ryan Flaherty, who put down the tag for the second out.Another great play by the team that leads the league in outfield assists.Mookie Betts came up and hit a ball toward the gap. But the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Gold Glove center fielder ran that one down and made a running, leaping catch in the gap. Three balls that normally would be hits, instead were outs.The Orioles would go on to score in the bottom of the second inning, and never look back.But Jonesy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done. Adam made a diving, flat-out catch in the gap to again rob Betts in the top of the fifth inning.The Baltimore Orioles have always prided themselves on defense. With Adam Jones, J.J. Hardy and Matt Wieters back, I think it is safe to say the O\xe2\x80\x99s probably have the best defense up the middle in baseball.Next: The long and circuitous road of Chaz Roe ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles minor league rundown 6/10: Runs everywhere you look', "" Gwinnett (Braves) 5, Norfolk Tides 4 (11 innings) The starting pitcher for Gwinnett in this game was named Sugar Ray Marimon, which is kind of awesome, although he's probably grown tired of people asking him if he just wants to fly. It was the Tides who scored a seventh inning run to tie things up at 4-4, which held until the 11th, when things started going wrong after reliever Pat McCoy issued a leadoff walk to Ryan Lavarnway. That does not sound like an ideal outcome at all.    There were some good things in the game for Norfolk, especially on the hitting side. Tides batters had 12 hits in the game, including a three-hit effort by Dariel Alvarez, and multi-hit games from Michael Almanzar and Derrik Gibson. The second baseman Gibson has three two-hit games out of his last four and is batting .323/.364/.452 in 10 games since being promoted to Norfolk. Pedro Beato had a strong game in long relief for the Tides, tossing three innings in which he didn't give up any hits or walks. Bowie Baysox 9, Binghamton (Mets) 4 If you score four runs in the second inning and four runs in the third inning, you darn well better win a particular baseball game - although Bowie, despite taking the 4-0 lead, promptly allowed Binghamton to tie things back up in the top of the third inning. The Mets runs scored against Baysox starter Tim Berry, who didn't allow any other runs outside of that inning, but isn't that always the way? Six innings and four earned runs allowed on eight hits isn't a great day.    The Baysox offense, however, had a great day, with every batter reaching base, most of them more than once. Jason Esposito had a two-run home run in the second inning, and all of Brandon Snyder, Trey Mancini, and Garabez Rosa had multi-hit games in the contest.    Mancini is the most prospect-y of those guys. He was named the Carolina League Player of the Month for May. You'll note he is no longer in the Carolina League because he was so awesome as to get promoted. He's only played in five games since the promotion to Double-A. They were a good five games - a .300/.330/.550 batting line. Myrtle Beach (Cubs) 9, Frederick Keys 6 (11 innings) This was a wild game. The Keys were trailing 3-2 when the ninth inning began. They gave up three runs in the top of the inning to fall behind 6-2, then scored four runs in the bottom of the ninth to tie things up and send the game into extra innings. Unfortunately, once it got into the 11th, they gave up another three runs, which was more than they could overcome a second time.    Keys starter David Hess gave up three runs on nine hits in six innings. He walked none and struck out two. The Keys were outhit 18-12 in the game. Chance Sisco and Josh Hart, two of the O's top picks from back in 2013, both had multi-hit games. Delmarva Shorebirds 6, Hagerstown (Walgreens) 1 A good day for the big boy, Jomar Reyes, who had a double and triple and drove in three runs for Delmarva. He also walked! I like walks, unless Orioles pitchers are issuing them. Reyes is the best thing about following Delmarva's roster. His season batting line looks like this: .280/.341/.420. That's yet to unlock the monster power that can probably be found in that frame, but he's only 18 and, as they say, holding his own in a full season league, which is kind of a big deal.

Maybe he'll be the first June 11 Oriole? Look, probably not, alright. When you're a 19th round pick and a fifth-year senior it probably means MLB isn't in your future.

The kind of hate that can only be born from a play like, just to pick a random example, an umpire missing the most blatant display of fan interference of all time, allowing another team to win the ALCS and then World Series when it should have been the Orioles.    When your favorite team is playing that hated team, it's sweet to see them win a close game due to some dramatic late-game theatrics. Like, say, the kind of game the Orioles played against the Yankees back on Cal Ripken statue night in 2012. You know the one. There is a sweeter kind of victory still. When the Orioles take the field against that hated team and they just stomp the everloving crap out of them. When that hated team comes undone stitch by stitch, their every vulnerability laid bare on the baseball field, one embarrassing mistake after another, that is when the victory is most glorious. When that hated Yankees team looks, quite frankly, like so many bad Orioles teams of the early-, mid, and late-00s, that is a fun baseball game. That's the kind of game the Orioles won against the Yankees on Friday night, stomping them into the ground in an 11-3 win. It was only one game, but my gosh, what a game.    Ubaldo struggles early The game did not look nearly so glorious early on. Starter Ubaldo Jimenez managed to load the bases with no one out in the first inning before artfully escaping that jam with an infield popup, strikeout, and flyout. All's well that ends well, although he threw 27 pitches in the inning.    This when the Orioles were facing Yankees starter Michael Pineda. The last time they saw him, they struck out 16 times in his seven innings of work and it was they who were more or less laughed out of the stadium. That was not the case in this game. Manny Machado walked to lead off the bottom of the first and Jimmy Paredes had a single. It was the O's who threatened. Chris Davis drove in Machado with a single and it was the O's who were on the board first. The lead did not last for so long. Brett Gardner was hit by a pitch to start off the third inning, and, because Jimenez at times does not believe in holding runners, Gardner stole second base easily. Alex Rodriguez brought Gardner home to the tie score - Rodriguez's 2,993rd hit and 1,999th RBI of his career. Mark Teixeira singled after Rodriguez to keep the threat alive before Jimenez escaped once again.    LOL Yankees (Part 1) In the end, it wasn't a big deal. Machado led off the third inning with a sharp grounder to Yankees third baseman Chase Headley. The ball took an awkward bounce and, instead of fielding it, Headley was instead struck in the nuts (BALLS LOLOLOL) before the ball rolled on past him and into the left field corner. This was a two base error. Paredes followed with an infield single in Headley's direction. Neither Headley nor Pineda could get there in time. A clean Jones single to center followed to put the Orioles back on top and it was once again up to Davis to drive men in. Pineda started out by throwing Davis a ball. Then I guess he was like, crap, I'd better throw Davis a strike. Davis crushed that strike over the out-of-town scoreboard for his 13th home run of the season, a beautiful Earl Weaver special that gave the Orioles a 5-1 lead. Pineda was blasted for six runs, five earned, on nine hits in only 4.1 innings of work. Ubaldo's later struggles Staked to a four run lead, what do you not want to do? Walk the very first batter, who's batting .231 and slugging .302. Jimenez chose not to adhere to this strategy, walking Didi Gregorius and looking like he was going to also walk Stephen Drew before getting a groundout.    Jimenez then served up an absolute meatball to Yankees center fielder Mason Williams, who was making his major league debut in the game. Williams, who, with 23 home runs in 2,049 career minor league plate appearances, is no serious power hitter, crushed a ball into the right-center field seats, ten rows deep. A fan kindly threw the ball back onto the field for him. The Yankees pulled within two runs and Ubaldo was clearly headed for a short outing. Though he retired the Yankees 1-2-3 in the fifth inning, Jimenez was up over 100 pitches and after a leadoff single to Carlos Beltran in the sixth inning, that was it for Jimenez. T.J. McFarland came on in relief to face the Yankees lefty-heavy lineup, which he did successfully in that he allowed no runs, although he loaded the bases in the process. Jimenez's line was a not great three runs on six hits and two walks in five innings plus a batter. He did strike out six, but mostly he was lucky his hitters were good and the Yankees fielders were, well... LOL Yankees (Part 2) The bottom of the sixth inning began with Caleb Joseph rocketing a ball directly into the glove of the Orioles bullpen catcher, his fifth home run of the season. That convinced Yankees manager Joe Girardi to bring out his human sacrifice, Esmil Rogers. You know how in\xc2\xa0Jurassic Park, there's that part where\xc2\xa0a live cow is dropped into the velociraptor pen? Esmil Rogers is the cow. Machado greeted Rogers with a hard ground ball to third base, which new Yankees third baseman Brendan Ryan (Headley must have needed to ice things down) booting the ball, although this was scored a hit. Well, no big deal. Rogers got the next batter, Paredes, to hit an easy grounder to Teixeira, who gloved the ball and threw it... way over the second baseman's head and into center field. This error broke a 109 game errorless streak for Teixeira. A wild pitch bounced around like a pinball to give the Orioles another run. Before the inning was out, the Orioles would grab two more runs, with Hardy doubling one in and Travis Snider singling in another. This was the Orioles' 10th run, their first time having so many since they blew out the Red Sox, 18-7.    Just for good measure, they grabbed one more run in the seventh inning, helped by one more Benny Hill-type play by the Yankees. Ryan Flaherty led off the inning with a hit, which gave every starter at least one hit. This actually was a misplay by Teixeira that could have easily ended his new errorless innings streak at one. Joseph hit an easy fly ball to right field that neither Gardner nor Beltran showed any inclination to catch as it dropped right between them. When the dust settled, the Orioles won the game 11-3. They had 16 hits, including an eye-popping 9-19 with runners in scoring position. It was their fifth win in a row, a season high, and it brought them back to .500 for the first time in over a month. It also was Buck Showalter's 407th win as an Oriole, tying him with Hank Bauer for third place on the franchise's manager wins list. The Orioles now trail the Yankees by three games in the AL East. Within 30 minutes of the game ending, Rogers was outrighted off the Yankees roster. As great as it all was, it's still only one game in June, and if they lose tomorrow they'll be back below .500 once again. Bud Norris and CC Sabathia, both of whom have had their rough patches in 2015, are the scheduled starters for the 7:15 game. The game will be televised on Fox.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
06/13/2015,"[('Orioles take advantage of Yankees bullpen again, win sixth ...', "" Not even facing the leader of the American League East could bring the Orioles winning streak to a screeching halt. Not on Friday night and not on Saturday night either. The streak is now six games, matching the longest Orioles winning streak of the Buck Showalter era. It was the Orioles who looked like a first place team as they beat the Yankees, much like yesterday.    By the time it was all over, the O's had another lopsided win, 9-4, pulling themselves to within two games of first - though they're still in fourth place. The top four teams in the division are 7-3 or better over their last ten games. Toronto has won ten straight now. Sheesh. Also much like yesterday's game, this one was not one that had an auspicious beginning. There was once again an Orioles starter struggling in the first inning of the game, in this case Bud Norris, whose struggles against lefties were always going to be amplified against a Yankees lineup that can bring out eight out of nine who are either left-handed batters or switch hitters. Norris gave up three hits in the first inning, with runs scoring on a rare opposite field hit by Mark Teixeira and a Brian McCann double off the right field wall that Delmon Young probably misplayed from a single into an RBI double. It was not an encouraging opening to the game on a night where the O's needed some length from Norris. But, he limited the damage and the Orioles trailed by two runs after half of an inning.     Nolan Reimold resumes an acquaintance In the time of his major league career, Orioles outfielder Nolan Reimold has faced no pitcher more than tonight's Yankees starter, CC Sabathia. Over the years, his appearances against Sabathia have gone well: in 29 plate appearances before tonight, Reimold had an .863 OPS against Sabathia. That is an exceptional mark for a pitcher who has had such a great career.    The Sabathia of this year is not the Sabathia of the past, however. That's bad for Sabathia. He entered tonight with an ERA over 5 and the Orioles made him look like it. Manny Machado led off the third inning with a single to bring Reimold, the tying run, to the plate. Sabathia had Reimold retired on a foul pop-up near the Orioles dugout, but Teixeira and McCann shied away from one another and the ball, totally catchable, fell between them. The very next pitch, Reimold homered to tie the game. Isn't that always the way it goes?    With his team catching him up, Norris settled down for a while, retiring 12 out of 13 Yankees batters starting in the second inning. Then the Orioles bats went to work again. They were not done homering. They're never done homering. Ryan Flaherty led off the bottom of the fifth with a single. Sabathia then let the count get to 3-1 against Machado. That's a bad idea. Machado took advantage of the hitter's count to launch a home run into the Orioles bullpen, giving the team a 4-2 lead. That's Machado's 11th home run of the year, putting him in second place on the Orioles behind Chris Davis' 13. Reimold followed the home run with a triple. It's not bad when you knock out the home run and triple from a potential cycle right off, but he ended the night 2-5 and got no closer to that cycle. Oh well. He also didn't score in the inning because the 3-4-5 hitters whiffed on the chance to drive a guy in from third starting with no outs. The missed run would, for a brief time, haunt the Orioles.    The Yankees connection to Satan is proved Alex Rodriguez hit his 666th home run of his career in this game. That's the connection. You already knew this. Now there's proof. Chase Headley, groin recovered from last night's impact, led off the top of the sixth inning with a single, putting him on base for Rodriguez. Norris made a bad pitch and Rodriguez crushed it, also notching his 2,000th and 2,001st RBI of his career in the process. The score was thus tied at 4-4 and Norris continued to be on the ropes. Teixeira doubled with none out, though he was erased when O's first baseman Steve Pearce alertly fired across the diamond on a grounder to first. Teixeira looked legitimately stunned when he was tagged out. This proved crucial as it meant the lead runner was only the slow McCann when Didi Gregorius later doubled. For the second straight game, it was time for the O's to dip into the bullpen in the sixth inning. First up was T.J. McFarland, a lefty coming in to face a lineup full of lefties. A match made in heaven! Except instead of being a LOOGY he was a NOOGY. McFarland walked the .172 hitter Stephen Drew. When Yankees manager Joe Girardi pinch hit right-handed Chris Young, McFarland was yanked for... Chaz Roe? Roe got Young to hit a harmless fly ball to center, reminding us once again that these are not the loser Orioles of the past who give up gut-wrenching grand slams to the Yankees. Well, that happened once earlier this year, but let's not split hairs.    With the inherited runners being stranded, Norris' line saw him giving up four runs on eight hits in 5.2 innings. His ERA began the day at 8.63 and ended it at 8.29, so he passed the Matusz Test, barely. Oops, I did it again, I played with your pen, and then won the game As Yankees reliever Chris Martin was doing his warmup tosses to start the bottom of the sixth inning, the Fox broadcast crew told an almost charming story about how Martin was working at an appliance store, out of baseball after an injury, before realizing he could still throw 94. Matt Wieters greeted Martin by hitting a double. Martin unleashed the first of three wild pitches in the inning, letting Wieters move up to third base and forcing the Yankees to pull their infielders in. This time the Orioles did not waste the opportunity. J.J. Hardy grounded a little single up the middle that could have only been a hit with the infield in. Some nights you ride the BABIP dragon. Other nights your flesh is seared before the enormous jaws close upon you and rip you apart. It was the second kind of night for Martin. Later in the inning, Machado squibbed a ball into right field that scored another pair of runs. That's too bad. The Orioles punished one poor Yankees reliever, Esmil Rogers, so hard yesterday that he was banished from the roster. His replacement was Sergio Santos, who pitched the seventh and eighth innings.    Santos fared little better. The first batter he saw was pinch hitter David Lough and Santos gave up a home run to Lough, the first Orioles pinch hit home run since last June. By the time they were done with Santos, another run had scored and the Orioles were up 9-4, again making a game into something of a laugher once they saw the soft part of the Yankees bullpen. Meanwhile, Roe chewed up needed innings for the Orioles. He ended up getting through 2.1 innings of relief, though he was helped by a slick double play turned by Ryan Flaherty on a lineout. If you were going to tell me you envisioned Roe successfully pitching clutch innings for the Orioles this year back in spring training, I'd call you a liar. That's what happened, though. So that's six straight for the Orioles. It also puts Showalter in sole possession of third place on the all time wins list by Orioles managers. He would need to win another 120 to pass Paul Richards for second place. The O's will go for the sweep of the Yankees on Sunday afternoon at 1:35. Mike Wright is probably starting for the Orioles, while Adam Warren is expected to start for New York.

Tampa Bay Rays defeated Baltimore Orioles 3-0. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAfter a slow overall start of the season for the Orioles offense, particularly in the month of May, the current trend seems to be one of revival to a level of play more in line with expectations.Among Orioles players kicking it up a notch are Manny Machado and Chris Davis. With these corner infielders missing significant amounts of time at the end of the 2014 season, their return to strong offensive contribution was deemed by all baseball writers and followers to be critical for the O\xe2\x80\x99s success.Their central role in producing runs was seen in the 11-3 Orioles win over the Yankees on Friday evening. Machado was 2-for-4 with a walk and three runs scored. Davis was 3-for-5 with a three-run homer and four RBIs.But it has not often looked like this over the early portion of the season.\xc2\xa0 More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injurySpring training looked great for Machado. He played well, and it was clear that the knee surgery issues were very much a thing of the past. But then he got off to a rather slow start offensively, including a 0-for-15 stretch in the first five games.

Over the past six games, Machado is 11-for-25 with two home runs.Chris Davis also struggled early in the season, even as he did accumulate some home runs and runs driven in. But he was also collecting strikeouts at a literal all-time record pace.However, the rate of strikeouts has gone down, while the offensive side of the game has been lighting up. In his first 20 games he struck out 32 times. In the next 20, it was 30 times.

We could call that a reasonably good season, especially if Davis continues to cut back on the strikeouts and drive in runs in critical situations.It is no secret that the O\xe2\x80\x99s need these two players in particular to produce in order to have success.Next: Orioles only ranked 21st in MLB power rankings ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Michael Pineda\\u2019s Time Off Leads to a Forgettable Start ...', '     Supported by    Baseball |                            Orioles 11, Yankees 3                                                             Michael Pineda\xe2\x80\x99s Time Off Leads to a Forgettable Start  By BILLY WITZJUNE 12, 2015    Continue reading the main story Share This Page  Continue reading the main story                if (             window.magnum             && window.magnum.getFlags().indexOf(\'headlineBalancer\') > 0             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.shouldRun()         ) {             window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize();         }         Photo       Yankees starter Michael Pineda, trying to throw to first base in the third inning, collided with Chase Headley.

Baltimore Orioles defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 6-2. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsAfter stringing together six wins in a row, the Orioles are finally resembling the team most fans were waiting to see this season. Unfortunately for the Orioles, the rest of the division has turned around their slow start in the past weeks as well. Now the Orioles are above .500 for first time in a long time, but still hovering around fourth place despite being only two games behind the division-leading Yankees.Lately the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup is beginning to find solid ground. Underperforming members of the roster like Alejandro De Aza and Everth Cabrera have been replaced with more consistently productive players, and the starting rotation and bullpen have settled into the consistency expected from the beginning of the season.\xc2\xa0Live Feed steve pearceBlue Jays' Pearce finally showing life with the bat Jays JournalFantasy Baseball 2017: Early Waiver Wire Pickups Ahead of Week 2 Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksBlue Jays releasing Justin Smoak not a viable immediate solution Jays JournalBlue Jays\xe2\x80\x99 front office shows again its ability to act quickly Jays JournalToronto Blue Jays: First Base and Left Field Tip of the TowerBlue Jays: Still in on Angel Pagan for left field? Jays JournalThe return of J.J. Hardy, Ryan Flaherty, Matt Wieters and Nolan Reimold have brought a stability to several key positions that have been struggling for consistency for most of the season, but their return has clogged up and already crowded roster.The concern going forward has to be the inflexibility of the roster, and how it could force the Orioles to cut ties with more valuable players going forward. Right now the Orioles have very few players with options, and with several players returning from injury, the logjam may prove to be a difficult puzzle yet again.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerJonathan Schoop, Wesley Wright and Rule-5 draftee Jason Garcia will all be returning from the DL in the not too distant future. The Orioles may be forced to consider dealing Travis Snider or Steve Pearce once Schoop returns, since the addition of Nolan Reimold seems to have made them somewhat expendable. The Orioles could also consider dealing David Lough, but he brings tools with his speed and defense that Snider and Pearce do not.Neither Wesley Wright nor Jason Garcia have been particularly impressive this season, but the Orioles will do everything they can to keep them on the roster, or at least not lose them for nothing.Obviously as a Rule-5 player, Garcia will be more difficult to keep on the roster. He\xe2\x80\x99s just not ready to pitch at this level, but the Orioles want him for next season. That wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be quite as difficult if their roster wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so inflexible already.With the lefties in the bullpen and in AAA, the Orioles probably just don\xe2\x80\x99t need Wesley Wright, but coming off a long stint on the DL he probably has little to no trade value. The Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give them up for nothing, even if they don\xe2\x80\x99t need him.The Orioles could look at moving Tommy Hunter, if a team would be willing to shell out a decent return. Hunter is obviously still a valuable member of the bullpen, but he is a free agent after the season, and at this point the Orioles have to find flexibility somehow.You hear often that these problems tend to take care of themselves, but that probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be the case this time. Dan Duquette always finds clever ways to negotiate situations like this, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see exactly what the roster looks like a few weeks from now.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters ReturnMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

I suspect they liked the fact that there was little to no drama in the ending of Friday night\xe2\x80\x99s game, and they decided to follow suit last night. In the last of the sixth they took the lead back for good on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single. Later in the inning the O\xe2\x80\x99s had runners at first and second, both of whom moved up on a wild pitch.

One inning later pinch hitter David Lough hit what at first was ruled a triple. His deep shot to right field smacked off of the grounds crew shed, which according to Camden Yards\xe2\x80\x99 ground rules, is supposed to be a home run. And it was ruled as such after an umpire review, and the Orioles led 8-4.Steve Pearce would add an RBI-double in the last of the eighth inning to run it to 9-4, as the Orioles crusied to victory once again over New York. Incidentally, the aforementioned home run was David Lough\xe2\x80\x99s first pinch hit homer of his career. The Orioles also got great contributions from Chaz Roe and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day out of the bullpen to close things out, with Roe bridging the gap from the middle innings and O\xe2\x80\x99Day pitching the ninth.Norris said after the game that he felt good, especially since he was mowing hitters down in the middle innings (quote courtesy of\xc2\xa0Bryan Hoch and Connor Smolensky of MLB.com):It felt good to get back out there and find a groove. I really thought I found a groove in the middle innings there. Buck made a decision to go to the \xe2\x80\x98pen [in the sixth], and we got out of it. We scored a bunch the next inning, and nice win. So let\xe2\x80\x99s sweep the series tomorrow.Speaking of today\xe2\x80\x99s game, the Orioles will get to add a pitcher without removing one for once. Brian Matusz\xe2\x80\x98s eight-game suspension ended after last night\xe2\x80\x99s game, so he\xe2\x80\x99ll be reinstated to the roster and the O\xe2\x80\x99s will once again be playing with the full 25 men. Before last night\xe2\x80\x99s game Matusz (after returning from Sarasota where he worked out during the suspension) talked about how good it felt to be back with the team, although he declined to comment on the point about his suspension not being reduced and Will Smith getting a two-game reduction. The last thing the Orioles need is further discipline dished out to Matusz (or anyone) for running his mouth \xe2\x80\x93 smart move on Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s part, incidentally.\xc2\xa0The Orioles will have an opportunity to sweep New York this afternoon in the series finale. By virtue of the fact that he never saw action as a reliever while sitting in the bullpen, Mike Wright will enter into the rotation this afternon in place of Miguel Gonzalez. Wright will be opposed by New York\xe2\x80\x99s Adam Warren.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles wrapped up a strong week after sweeping Boston and taking two of three from the New York Yankees.The Baltimore Orioles started the week by beating the Cleveland Indians to prevent a sweep from occurring. They then played three against the Boston Red Sox, bringing out the brooms in a series sweep.The Orioles then took the first two against the New York Yankees, before losing the third game 5-3 on what was a swelteringly hot series in Baltimore.

A number of things.The Orioles win games when Brian Matusz is suspended, and then he comes back and they lose. Matusz played a role in that too. He came on after Mike Wright, who did not have his best stuff, walked the bases loaded. Matusz proceeded to walk someone right away, tie ball game.Matusz almost wiggled his way out of it, but a scorcher off the glove of Manny Machado (a play he had next-to-no chance of making) scored two, and the Yankees went up 5-3, the final score.All the blame doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Matusz, but walking the first person you face in almost two weeks is inexcusable. And it isn\xe2\x80\x99t like John Ryan Murphy (who had the RBI double) is a good hitter.Having Matt Wieters and Nolan Reimold on this team has already paid dividends. The Orioles now have a starting outfielder who can play almost every day. Reimold is patient at the plate, hitting well, has power, and can also play the OF without any issues.\xc2\xa0 He should be the everyday left fielder.Wieters has been good since coming back as well. He has brought stability to the defense, as has the return of J.J. Hardy. And, with Wieters back it allows Caleb Joseph to go back to playing less, and he has excelled when called upon.The starters have got to go deeper into games. Out of all the great performances this week, the starting rotation didn\xe2\x80\x99t have many. Sure, there were a lot of gutsy performances. But, too many starters had Buck Showalter take the ball out of their hand before they got through six innings. The bullpen is not overtaxed, because Buck is such a magician with the bullpen. But, the starters are not pitching great. You could say good if you were speaking optimistically, but the bullpen has masked a lot of it by being fantastic.The other bad news for the week is the fact that only six teams in all of baseball were 7-3 or better in their last 10 games.Two of them are the St. Louis Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Pirates, both at 7-3. Also 7-3 were the New York Yankees and the Tampa Bay Rays. 8-2 for the Baltimore Orioles, but 10-0 for the Toronto Blue Jays.It is way too early to worry about other teams, but the AL East is no longer being talked about as having a down year.\xc2\xa0 In fact, recently they have been nothing short of excellent. Except for the Red Sox, who are a train wreck.The Orioles play four games against the Philadelphia Phillies this week. The Phillies played 33 innings (two extra inning games) and only scored THREE runs. In the two extra inning games, the Phillies scored a total of ZERO runs.And, their pitching is not all that good, either. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will face Aaron Harang, Jerome Williams, Kevin Correia, and Sean O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan. The O\xe2\x80\x99s should be able to at least win three of four in the home-and-home series.After that, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will start a series against a team they need to start playing better against. That would be the Toronto Blue Jays. By the time the weekend comes around, that series could be a big one in the AL East.Next: Machado and Davis putting it together ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Chen pitches eight shutout innings, Wieters ... - Camden Chat', "" The Orioles beat the Phillies tonight in a game that took place entirely in two hours, nine minutes! I was at a baseball game between the Orioles and Yankees that was past that mark in the sixth inning. This was better, especially since the Orioles beat the team they were supposed to beat.    So the Phillies are a bad team this year. Like, really bad. Most of you knew that, and many of you probably thought that it would give the Orioles the old reverse lock to lose. But they didn't! They did only have five hits, which is kind of embarrassing considering the starting pitcher was Aaron Harang. Before I talk about Harang, can we all agree that he looks like Droopy Dog? A side-by-side:                           Anyway, Aaron Harang is actually the best starting pitcher on the Phillies this year not named Cole Hamels. That's not saying much, but he really hasn't been terrible. His ERA coming in to tonight was 3.04 and he's averaging almost 6 1/2 innings per start. But he is still a 37-year-old pitcher with a long history of mediocrity, so when the Orioles got through four innings with just one bunt single and one walk on the board, it was starting to feel like one of those nights. But then the Phillies, um, Philly'd, to allow the O's to score a run in the fifth inning. Manning left field for the Phillies tonight was Cody Asche, who is by trade a third baseman. That became painfully (for the Phillies, anyway) evident when Travis Snider hit a fly ball to deep left field. Your average left fielder would have caught the ball on the warning track, but Asche couldn't get a handle on it and Snider landed on second base. He came in to score on a line-drive single by J.J. Hardy just beyond the reach of the Phillies shortstop, Freddy Galvis. (I had to double check who played SS for them tonight. I was like...no, it's not Jimmy Rollins...)    That first run felt like kind of a fluke since the ball really should have been caught in left field. The next three runs were not a fluke. With Adam Jones and Chris Davis on base and two outs, Matt Wieters stepped to the plate and launched a ball into the night over the right field wall. Right fielder Jeff Francoeur just enjoyed the view as it sailed out of the park for a three-run home run. Those four runs were more than enough for starting pitcher Wei-Yin Chen, who pitched a gem tonight. Through seven innings the Phillies managed just three baserunners via walk, bunt single, and double. Four of those seven innings were 1-2-3, and in a fifth Chen faced only three batters thanks to a nifty double play turned by Chris Davis. When Cesar Hernandez led off the seventh inning with a double, Chen responded by striking out the next three batters. (In fairness, the home plate ump wasn't great tonight, but Chen still got the job done.) Chen tends to tire out between 90-100 pitches, and that started to show in the eighth inning. Luckily Chase Utley overslid second base and was tagged out as he tried to stretch a single to a double for one out in the eighth. That TOOTBLAN was followed by a single and a wild pitch by Chen, but he retired the final two batters to end what was a fantastic game for him.    Though it wasn't a save situation, Zach Britton came in to get some work and was as filthy as you're used to. O's win, 4-0, and have hopefully started another win streak.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles bring Chris Parmelee up to Baltimore on taxi squad ...', "" Chris Parmelee has been raking to the tune of a .312/.381/.446 batting line for the Triple-A Norfolk Tides this season. The left-handed first baseman/outfielder has a June 15 opt-out date in his contract, which means that the Orioles need to decide whether they want to do something with him promptly.    Parmelee is definitely not in Norfolk, according to\xc2\xa0Tides beat writer David Hall, and might be kicking around Camden Yards, although MASN's Roch Kubatko says that the team has placed Parmelee on the taxi squad, meaning they have avoided the need to make a decision for another 24 hours. That level of performance at Norfolk is not a guarantee of any kind of big league success, of course. There's always what they call AAAA players, who are good enough to have success at Triple-A but not really good enough to hack it in the majors. Parmelee played in parts of four seasons for the Twins before this year, batting a combined .249/.317/.392. Maybe that's who he is. Maybe he needed a change of scenery. The Orioles have already sent one struggling left-handed outfielder packing. One remains on the roster in the form of Travis Snider, from whom I have to think the O's were hoping they'd get greater than a .653 OPS by mid-June. Snider is in the lineup on Monday against the Phillies, so if there is going to be a roster move today, it seems like it won't be him.    If they were going to cut him tomorrow it would also be weird to have him in the lineup today. Why not just add Parmelee today, in that case? It's not impossible that they could play Snider today and cut him tomorrow. Dan Duquette is not known for being sentimental.    Other possible cuts who stand out for poor performance are Delmon Young (.663 OPS) and Steve Pearce (.648 OPS). Pearce offers the vague value of unexpectedly capable second base play. Young crashes through the outfield like a bowling ball, occasionally firing a strike to throw out some runner who thinks, heck, I'll run on Delmon Young out there. Young leads the AL in outfield assists. Of course, it's always possible that one of these guys has been nursing some injury and that's why they aren't hitting their way out of a wet paper bag. Or if they don't have an injury, they could have a real enough injury for the disabled list. Watch out for potholes, is all I'm saying.    If there's anything Duquette loves more than making roster moves, it's taking the maximum allotted time to make roster moves before he has to make them. Parmelee's Norfolk performance has been good enough that it would be tough for the O's to just let him opt out and go wherever someone might give him a big league job. More importantly, Orioles outfield performance has been poor enough that there's not much risk involved in giving Parmelee a shot over someone else.

However in any sequence of games perhaps the most important is the one immediately following a loss. The best way to avoid long losing streaks is to head them off at the pass before they start. The O\xe2\x80\x99s would have to wait to take the field against Philadelphia however, as a short rain delay preceded the game. But after that, Matt Wieters and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were ready for business.However while the game itself moved quickly, it took a bit of time for Oriole bats to get back on track against Philadelphia starter Aaron Harang. The good news was that Wei-Yin Chen matched Harang point for point. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 8 IP, 4 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 9 K. Chen was about as on point as a starting pitcher can be. And bear in mind that these interleague games are tough for players in the sense that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t as familiar with their opponents. However needless to say, the Birds dealt with that better than did Philadelphia.\xc2\xa0Live Feed matt witersThe game was scoreless until the last of the fifth. Following two pop outs, Travis Snider doubled to left on a ball that was somewhat misplayed by left fielder Cody Asche. That brought J.J. Hardy to the plate, and his RBI-single gave the Orioles a 1-0 lead. That of course ended up being enough to win the game \xe2\x80\x93 but the Birds didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that at the time.One inning later we saw what a difference little things can make in games. Following a one-out single by Jimmy Paredes, Adam Jones grounded into what looked to be a double-play. However Jones hustled down the line, and Paredes made a heck of a takeout slide at second base. With one final stretch, Jones was safe at first and the play was ruled a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice as opposed to an inning-ending double-play.Courtesy Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsAfter a subsequent Chris Davis walk, Matt Wieters effectively ended the evening\xe2\x80\x99s competitive phase with a three-run homer which ran the score to 4-0. Again, keep in mind what set that moment up. Jones hit a slow roller in the infield, and knew that he had a shot at staying out of the double-play. Jones\xe2\x80\x99 speed combined with Paredes\xe2\x80\x99 hard slide and Davis\xe2\x80\x99 walk a moment later brought Wieters to the plate with two runners on base.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Philadelphia isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily the worst team in the league, regardless of what the records indicate. The O\xe2\x80\x99s over time (this year and in the past) have tended to play both up and down to their opponents. We saw this in the series in Queens against the NY Mets (who granted have been streaking since then), and we saw it this past weekend against the NY Yankees.I would also remind fans that a near-hapless Orioles team traveled to Citizens Bank Park for a three-game weekend set in June of 2009. Adam Jones was already in center at that time, Chris Tillman and Brian Matusz were still in the minor leagues, and Matt Wieters had just made his big league debut about a month before. But that was not a good Orioles team under manager Dave Trembley, as many fans remember.\xc2\xa0That poor Orioles team swept a great Philadelphia team in three games that weekend.

(They won it all in 2008, and fell in the 2009 World Series to New York.)My point here is that things aren\xe2\x80\x99t always what they seem. So the Orioles can\xe2\x80\x99t take their \xe2\x80\x9cI-95 rivals\xe2\x80\x9d lightly this week.

It kept the Yankees in first place in the American League East \xe2\x80\x94 barely \xe2\x80\x94 and ended a three-game losing streak, with the help of a rally that required precious little exertion, even in sapping heat and humidity.The Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 three-run fifth inning was a walk in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 park.Trailing by 3-2, the Yankees barely needed to lift the bats from their shoulders. Orioles starter Mike Wright walked the bases loaded before he was lifted for Brian Matusz, who walked Garrett Jones for the tying run.Matusz struck out Stephen Drew and Didi Gregorius, but John Ryan Murphy grounded a double down the left-field line, just out of the reach of third baseman Manny Machado, putting the Yankees ahead by 5-3. It was their only hit of the inning.\xe2\x80\x9cI got into a good count, and he left me a good pitch to hit,\xe2\x80\x9d Murphy said. \xe2\x80\x9cI hit it hard.\xe2\x80\x9dMurphy made the most of a start, with a scheduled day off for Brian McCann, who has struggled defensively while providing a potent bat. Murphy had three hits, tying a career high, and was flawless behind the plate, helping the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 reconstituted bullpen close out the game with four and a third hitless innings.

He remains five hits shy of 3,000 as the Yankees head to his hometown.The Yankees will be without a designated hitter against the Marlins because the game is in a National League park, and Manager Joe Girardi said he did not plan to start Rodriguez, most likely using him as a pinch-hitter or in the field after a double switch. But Girardi said his plans could change.Rodriguez said he would not be disappointed at sitting on the bench when he had a chance to reach a milestone.\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99d ever have a chance,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodriguez said. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think about it too much.\xe2\x80\x9d               Orioles-Yankees Highlights             addResponsivePlayer(\'1e64dazsnh52v1u9j6u5iz3v14\', \'06c7c348-13be-4bf5-b1f0-8f1e92cfcb4c\', \'1lv4a7h8kcaqg10xcekejkbz5a\', \'perf1e64dazsnh52v1u9j6u5iz3v14-1lv4a7h8kcaqg10xcekejkbz5a\', \'eplayer41\', {autoHide:true, age:1429034246000});       A version of this article appears in print on June 15, 2015, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Yanks Keep Walking and Stay Put in First.

06/17/2015,"[('The Crazy World of the Baltimore Orioles', ""Jun 16, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones (10) pies right fielder Chris Parmelee (41) during a post game interview of the game against the Philadelphia Phillies at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Baltimore Orioles defeated Philadelphia Phillies 19-3. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsBaltimore Orioles fans are very familiar with the special deal that their advertising sponsor Papa John\xe2\x80\x99s gives to fans the day after the O\xe2\x80\x99s win a game and score five or more runs \xe2\x80\x93 they get 50% off their online order. So what happens when the Orioles win by a score of 19-3?\xc2\xa0 It would seem that Papa John\xe2\x80\x99s at that point should be paying people to get their pizzas delivered to them.A Bizarre GameWere the Baltimore Orioles that good, or were the Philadelphia Phillies that bad?\xc2\xa0 Yes, and yes.The Orioles set a franchise record by hitting a total of eight home runs. Just imagine how many more there would have been if DD did not trade away Nelson Cruz and Nick Markakis!\xc2\xa0 Sorry \xe2\x80\x93 an evil spirit made me write that snotty sentence.It sounds impressive that they hit eight homers, until you realize that seven of them were with the bases empty!\xc2\xa0 Yep, that\xe2\x80\x99s typical of the Orioles. Only David Lough hit one with runners on base. So, only 10 runs were produced by the eight home runs. Earl Weaver would be disappointed in that. Maybe after wearing down the Phils\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen it will help them to do better in one of these next two games in Philadelphia.

He gave up five home runs as a relief pitcher.The interesting thing about the veteran pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s outing is that he had a lot of good movement on many of his pitches, but, \xe2\x80\x9cOops, there goes another one over the fence again!\xe2\x80\x9dThe only thing that could have made this an even more salubrious experience for O\xe2\x80\x99s fans would have been if Jonathan Papelbon was the guy setting the record. It might have even knocked the ridiculous pucker off his face.A Bizarre Roster MoveDid any of you see the Chris Parmelee addition involving Wei-Yin Chen being sent down for one start? If you answer \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you. What a world \xe2\x80\x93 pitch eight shutout innings and get sent to the minors!Apparently Chen was not exactly thrilled with the news, although the official report as spoken by Showalter would seem to indicate that the pitcher understood the reasoning.Embed TweetDoes this embitter him for offseason negotiations when he becomes a free agent? Well \xe2\x80\x93 what difference does that make? Remember, Scott Boras is his agent.The move already paid off, as Parmelee celebrated his promotion with four hits and two homers.

But those guys accounted for six home runs and a double.The most glaring thing about that is the absence of Adam Jones. I am not surprised that Jones needs a day or two off. He has had so many foul balls hit him, along with attempting diving catch plays in the past week. But who knew that leaving AJ out of the lineup would produce 19 runs?A Bizarre FutureThere seems to be no end to the way that the Baltimore Orioles creatively use the 25-man and 40-man rosters. The Orioles have already used a total of 40 different players this season.But this cannot continue forever, that is unless there are some more injuries in the near future that create movement possibilities. But Jonathan Schoop is going to be coming back, as well as Kevin Gausman. Hopefully also Miguel Gonzalez. And there are more than just these names. At some point the Orioles are just not going to be able to keep everyone.A Bizarre ScheduleSo it is on to Philadelphia for two more games. The Phils have lost eight in a row, while the O\xe2\x80\x99s finished a 7-1 homestand. What an irony it would be to see the Phillies come back to life on the home cooking and win a game or two after getting totally shellacked the past two days.It is all very strange \xe2\x80\x93 lots of strange happenings for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, but that is what makes baseball such a great sport.Next: A look at the O's great clutch hitting numbers "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles Raise Some Brows with Chen Demotion', 'So how about stashing\xc2\xa0a pitcher in the minor leagues\xc2\xa0after he had\xc2\xa0tossed eight shutout innings for the Baltimore Orioles Monday night?Is stashing a cynical word, or is it pretty much what happened? Wei-Yin Chen improved (a possible misnomer) his record to 3-4, and lowered his ERA to 2.89 by allowing the Phillies 4 hits over eight innings in a 4-0 win Monday. Then the Orioles, in a roster crunch, needing to do something with Chris Parmelee before his opt-out deadline, brought him up from Norfolk and used one of Chen\xe2\x80\x99s options to send him down for 10 days.\xc2\xa0Live Feed wei-yin chenMiami Marlins: Wei-Yin Chen placed on DL with tired arm Call to the PenMiami Marlins: Wei-Yin Chen Pitching Through Partial UCL Tear Call to the PenMarlins Wei-Yin Chen: Two-start pitcher for deep leagues Fantasy Baseball CrackerjacksTime to Quit on Chen?

The unfriendly confines of Rogers Centre feature a mostly righthanded hitting lineup, including the especially unfriendly bats of Jose Batista and Edwin Encarnacion.\xc2\xa0The New York Mets ended the Jays\xe2\x80\x99 11-game winning streak Monday night.Manager Buck Showalter said Chen had complain of \xe2\x80\x9coverall body fatigue\xe2\x80\x9d in his previous start, reported by MASNSports.com. This has plausibility\xc2\xa0as a reason to rest him and is within the rules as a piece of roster manipulation. One can\xe2\x80\x99t really complain about the results, with Parmelee going 4 for 6, with two home runs in his Oriole debut.Then last night, Chen tweeted (and we all know the power of\xc2\xa0tweeting) his disappointment with, first:\xe2\x80\x9cI am disappointed my routine is being interrupted. I will continue to work hard and do my best to perform. Thank you for all the support!\xe2\x80\x9d And then: \xe2\x80\x9cI am in excellent physical shape. I feel great and I am ready for my next start. I just pitched 8 innings of shutout baseball.Whether this sounds miffed is open\xc2\xa0to anyone\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, as is the question\xc2\xa0of any effect it has on Chen\xe2\x80\x99s contract talks next offseason. Showalter responded after the game by saying the team, and Chen\xe2\x80\x99s health, are the priorities, and not what happens in the offseason. We\xe2\x80\x99re not here to put words in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, but if that was a subtle message to Chen\xe2\x80\x99s agent, well, that is also open to interpretation.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

The team moved to two games over .500 heading into a pair of games at Philadelphia, whose team is a major league-worst 22-45.Ubaldo Jimenez starts tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game at Citizens Bank Park. His stats are ugly against the Phillies. The good news is the David Lough, who homered against the Yankees Friday night and hit a 3-run homer last night, is 7 for 11 against Phillies starter Kevin Correia.There is no word on whether Adam Jones will suit up again, after being rested Tuesday with an assortment of bumps and bruises, having turned his left ankle last week and then fouled some pitches off that foot since then.

And given that Mike Trout is also in the American League, that in and of itself is also debatable. However needless to say, everyone out there knows what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with the AL all-star voting, and the controversy surrounding it.Courtesy of\xc2\xa0David Richard-USA TODAY SportsFor starters, I\xe2\x80\x99m not just another writer with an east coast bias that\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly calling foul at the idea that the Kansas City Royals (a small market, mid-western team) are monopolizing the voting. But removing the location or fan base from the equation, that in and of itself is the problem. Many fans skoff at the idea of the all-star game, and in some cases I understand why. However we should also keep in mind that baseball is based largely on tradition \xe2\x80\x93 part of that tradition is the MLB all-star game.

Under no circumstances, and for no positions. With that said, here\xe2\x80\x99s the counter-argument to that: if the game is for the fans, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the fans decide who plays? And perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s a valid question.For starters, baseball\xe2\x80\x99s not a game at the professional level; it\xe2\x80\x99s a job. Yes for sure it\xe2\x80\x99s a game that everyone knows and loves, however when you\xe2\x80\x99re paid to do something (even play a game), it\xe2\x80\x99s your job. So I would ask anyone reading this, would you feel comfortable with allowing people who may or may not be educated enough in your field of choice to decide who\xe2\x80\x99s the creme de la creme and who\xe2\x80\x99s not?

So quite literally, people who vote with one team and one goal (of getting their entire team to the all-star game) in mind could be doing undue detriment to someone. It\xe2\x80\x99s too easy to say players make millions of dollars; they\xe2\x80\x99ll survive without that bonus. But would you be happy knowing that someone out there was messing with your money?So yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that all of the Kansas City Royals fans out there who are stuffing the ballot box are in the wrong. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing anything that anyone else can\xe2\x80\x99t do, mind you, however just because you can do something doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you should. That would be like saying that players and teams that \xe2\x80\x9chot dog\xe2\x80\x9d their way around the bases after a home run, or rub salt in the wounds of opponents aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing anything wrong per se..right?!Having eight members of one team in the starting lineup (when in fact many of them don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to be there) is disrespectful to the game and to the great players who play it. And yes, by virtue of the fact that non-deserving players were voted onto the team, someone\xe2\x80\x99s finances could be affected. Again, I recognize that some will say this comes off as east coast sour grapes. However I\xe2\x80\x99m far from the only writer who\xe2\x80\x99s made mention of it \xe2\x80\x93 you can put even the likes of ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Buster Olney in that same category as well.So I would submit that moving foward baseball people should choose the teams. The fact that so many New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies, and other big market teams\xe2\x80\x99 players would make the roster each year shows how biased things can be. And the fact that so many Kansas City Royals will be making it this year is indicative of the same thing. Putting the decision in the hands of baseball people will ensure that the truly deserving players are invited to the game, and start the game. Not just the players that certain people want to see. Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s all-star game is probably the most historic of all the sports. So it should thus be treated as such. Having said that, I would submit that if things remain as they are and the AL starters are eight Royals plus Mike Trout (who incidentally is a legitimate selection), fans should consider boycotting the game. But maybe not the whole game \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps just the first 40 minutes to an hour or so. By that time the second wave of players will be rotated into the game in the spirit of letting everyone play. Unless of course the Kansas City fans are expecting that their players should be playing the entire game also.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Will two NL games foul things up?More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

The Orioles defeated the Phillies, 6-4. Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles won their third consecutive game over the Phillies on Wednesday night 6-4. It marked also their ninth win in the past 10 games, and the 11th win in the past 13. This is a surge that was greatly needed after the O\xe2\x80\x99s dropped to a season-worst 23-29 on June 3rd.\xc2\xa0 So, a total of 13 games later, the Orioles are now 34-31.However, one would expect that when you go 11-for-13 in wins that you would pick up more than three games on the divisional leader. But that is all the ground the Orioles have been able to close \xe2\x80\x93 from five games behind to two games behind \xe2\x80\xa6 and even that is a tie for third place.All of this is because the American League East has been very recently living up to its long-time hype as the toughest division in baseball. Over this same relative span, the Blue Jays won 11 in a row, the Yankees eight consecutively, and the Rays have somehow continued to win games. Only the Red Sox have melted down \xe2\x80\x93 oh well, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to a more deserving group of __________ (insert your own insult).Just looking over the past 10 games, the Orioles have the best record at 9-1, while the Jays are 8-2, the Rays 7-3 and the Yankees 5-5.

Though this is probably true to some extent, as with the famous line of Mark Twain, the story of the division\xe2\x80\x99s death is greatly exaggerated.The entire division got off to a mediocre start and by the middle of May was only performing at a cumulative .500 pace.\xc2\xa0 It got worse. By the beginning of June, the division was actually 15 games below .500!But since that time, in just two and one-half weeks, the division has gone 48-26, and that includes games played against one another.Here is a chart of the cumulative W/L record of the AL East division in the 2015 season so far \xe2\x80\xa64/1524-21.5335/161-54.5305/1590-90.5006/1121-136.4716/15169-162.511\xc2\xa0Currently, as seen in the chart, the AL East is seven games over .500.\xc2\xa0 The AL Central is nine games over .500, while the AL West is one game over.In the National League, the East is 27 games under .500, the Central is 13 games over, and the West is three games under.All of this is to say that the AL East is not as bad as advertised, and the trend is decidedly toward the positive. The Orioles need to keep on winning, especially within the division where they are exactly one-half done with the schedule at 20-18.

Batting for Steve Pearce, pinch-hitter Jimmy Paredes broke up Estrada\xe2\x80\x99s no-hit bid with a bloop single to left to begin the eighth, ending a streak of 15 straight outs. Bench coach DeMarlo Hale, filling in for ejected manager John Gibbons, immediately came out and replaced Estrada with Roberto Osuna. Estrada, who threw a season-high 118 pitches, left to a standing ovation from the crowd of 32.322. Estrada (5-3) won his fourth straight start, allowing one run in seven-plus innings. He walked four and struck out six. Dave Stieb still has thrown the only no-hitter in Blue Jays history, doing it against Cleveland on Sept. 2, 1990. Adam Jones hit a two-out, two-run single off Brett Cecil in the ninth, but Cecil struck out Chris Davis for his fifth save. The nine-game streak is Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s longest run at home since 1998, when they also won nine. The Blue Jays won a record 10 straight at home in 1985. The Blue Jays and Orioles, AL East rivals who have feuded several times in recent seasons, wasted no time in renewing hostilities. Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Jose Bautista was hit by a pitch in the first and Gibbons was ejected for arguing after both benches were warned. Orioles right-hander Mike Wright (2-3) brushed Bautista back with an 0-1 pitch, prompting warnings from plate umpire CB Bucknor. Gibbons came out and was ejected for the second time before engaging in a lengthy discussion with crew chief Dale Scott. Orioles manager Buck Showalter came out at the end of the first to speak with Bucknor, but was not ejected. Bautista has a history with Orioles reliever Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day dating to 2013, but several different incidents have fueled the rivalry. The most recent came in an April 21 game at Toronto when Bautista argued with Jones after Orioles rookie Jason Garcia threw behind the Blue Jays slugger. Osuna and Hale were ejected after Osuna hit Jones to load the bases with one out in the eighth.

Well, maybe it is a bit of an over-the-top statement, but really, this current Phils team is as bad as any I have seen in many years.The Orioles simply looked exhausted from too much running around the bases of late. The Philadelphia pitching was good, but certainly not great. Manny Machado opened the game with a homer, but O\xe2\x80\x99s fans could have turned it off at that point and not missed practically any other offense at all.The Phillies\xe2\x80\x99 two runs came on a Ryan Howard home run off Bud Norris in the sixth inning with two outs. Norris had pitched well, but from Howard\xe2\x80\x99s first two times to the plate, it could be seen that he was on to Norris. We really needed to see Brian Matusz at that point, as there was no need to bleed Norris through that full inning.But, when you only score one run, you can\xe2\x80\x99t blame your starting pitcher for giving up two runs that cost you the game. And when your starter only gives up two runs in six innings, you probably should win the game.It is good to see Norris pitching better, but it is still not quite \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x9d yet. These were the Phillies, you know.On To TorontoMuch is being made of this series with Toronto \xe2\x80\x93 a team playing as well or better than the Orioles. It would be nice to take two games, and then two more in Boston. But if the O\xe2\x80\x99s can get at least a split, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be a disaster of a road trip.

Many teams out there such as Toronto and even Kansas City argue that the Orioles seem to be one of those teams who feel it\xe2\x80\x99s their duty to enforce unwritten rules. And if you\xe2\x80\x99re a team that wears their emotions on their sleeves a bit more so than do the Orioles, one might understand how teams feel that way.Nevertheless regardless of where you lie in terms of who\xe2\x80\x99s right and wrong, the Orioles have made moves to right the ship in terms of wins and losses in the past few weeks. They can\xe2\x80\x99t allow themselves to get into a back-and-forth with a team like Toronto this weekend. That would be incredibly misguided on their part.\xc2\xa0Having said that, the Orioles seem to rarely be the team that starts these types of things. That might sound short-sighted, however in general this is my observation. So what do they do if Toronto starts hitting people? Do the O\xe2\x80\x99s just stand there and take it?I suppose it matters how things go. Toronto of course knows that the Orioles see themselves as protectors of the unwritten rules. They also know that the Orioles have recently broken out of a big funk from the month of May.

But to a certain degree, yes the Orioles should let a few things go if trouble comes down the pike.

The point here is also the same for Toronto; these two teams are in the thick of the race for first in their division. Neither of them can really afford to get into something with the other.And bear in mind that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just these games of which we\xe2\x80\x99re speaking. Granted the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t want to allow themselves to get sidetracked from just playing baseball this weekend. However the worst-case scenario of course is a bench-clearing brawl. That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a draconian scenario, but work with me. Those incidents usually end with multiple players from both teams being suspended. While you never back down if someone\xe2\x80\x99s threatening you, can the Orioles really afford that?\xc2\xa0Of course not. And if the Brian Matusz situation is any indication, one could probably expect harsher penalties on the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 side if such an incident were to occur. But the message here is just that these teams should try to take it easy this weekend. Just play baseball and let whatever is in the past remain in the past.Next: Baltimore Orioles raise some brows with Chen demotionMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

06/20/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Inside the bad blood - Birds Watcher', ""We can debate CB Bucknor\xe2\x80\x99s decision to issue warnings in the first inning of last night\xe2\x80\x99s game until the cows come home. Many fans of both Toronto and the Baltimore Orioles felt it was unnecessary. That\xe2\x80\x99s all a matter of opinion, however at the end of the day this thing ended up involving a lot of players and coaches \xe2\x80\x93 including Adam Jones.But I\xe2\x80\x99m going to use my \xe2\x80\x9cbully pulpit\xe2\x80\x9d here to give you my reasons for my own view on the matter. MLB\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to avoid fights at all costs. I\xe2\x80\x99m the first one to tell you that some of these fights are fairly entertaining. In fact, if I\xe2\x80\x99m bored during warmups before games I\xe2\x80\x99ll sometimes surf youtube and watch baseball fights.

Included in those reports was undoubtably something about the bad blood between the two sides (possibly dating back to 2013). So these umpires were well aware of what had gone on back in April.Again, their goal is to prevent a fight. So when Bautista got hit, CB Bucknor issued warnings across the board so as to avoid further escalation. As I said in my column this morning, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Mike Wright was trying to hit Bautista. Heck, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to intentionally hit someone, don\xe2\x80\x99t just graze their jersey! But Bucknor took the stance that\xc2\xa0the law is blind in a sense, and tried to de-escalate the situation \xe2\x80\x93 which is what he\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to do.Toronto and manager John Gibbons felt they were being punished for one of their guys being hit, however that\xe2\x80\x99s also not looking past the tip of one\xe2\x80\x99s nose. The warnings weren\xe2\x80\x99t about that specific incident, they were about the past. And if Gibbons wants to argue that the past should just be the past and so forth, then he might ask his slugger (Bautista) why he proceeded to glare at Wright, argue with Wieters, and run his mouth towards the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout the entire way down the first base line.\xc2\xa0More from Adam Jones7/21 - Baltimore Orioles: Headed to sick bay6/29 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones: Hometown boy makes good6/26 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 comeback started with an Adam Jones catch6/25 - Baltimore Orioles brought back on the bat of Adam Jones6/17 - Baltimore Orioles: Adam Jones swings Birds into firstIn turn, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Adam Jones was hit intentionally either. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said thisCourtesy of Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sportsbefoe, but umpires should apply just a bit of baseball savoir faire in these cases and ask themselves if someone would hit a batter in a given situation. Odds are that a team isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to hit Adam Jones to load the bases and bring Chris Davis to the plate \xe2\x80\x93 especially with a 3-1 count.However as I said this morning, the warning was in fact in place. And as I said above,\xc2\xa0the law is blind. Had Bucknor not run Osuna and DeMarlo Hale, he probably would have had to eject Buck Showalter (who would have argued that a warning was in place and his guy got hit). To his credit, Jones didn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word on the way down to first base.Incidentally, while Bautista reacted in a predictable manner on the field, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to discuss the matter after the game. Whereas last time this flared up he ran his mouth about the Orioles to reporters after the game, last night he specifically said that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it. And that\xe2\x80\x99s to his credit.Again, whether or not the warnings were just is up to debate. My personal opinion is that while it did affect the game in a negative manner from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 perspective, it also served a purpose. The goal is to avoid a fight, and sometimes there has to be the threat of ejection or perhaps even further disciplinary action to make players think twice about what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing.This is not to say that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a time and a place for hitting batters, because as most readers know I\xe2\x80\x99m a strong believer in the unwritten codes of the game and the enforcement thereof. But the strong arm of the law also has to play a role in that, which is why CB Bucknor did what he did last night. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll even take this a step further \xe2\x80\x93 if the umpires are really on point, they\xe2\x80\x99re issuing warnings for today\xe2\x80\x99s game as lineup cards are being exchanged right now.Here\xe2\x80\x99s another interesting point regarding this; it seems like these teams\xe2\x80\x99 personalities were taken into consideration also in the events of last night. While Bucknor did what he did in the wake of a Toronto hitter being hit, it\xe2\x80\x99s plain as day that Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s a team that has no problem expressing their opinions about opposing teams and players in pubic. Jose Bautista was almost glaring accusingly at Mike Wright\xc2\xa0before that pitch grazed his jersey. And he appeared to have already rehearsed his walk down to first while antagonizing the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout.\xc2\xa0So take that, which is consistent with Bautista\xe2\x80\x99s past, and look at the quick hook that Bucknor had on John Gibbons. Then look at Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 walk to first after being hit (in effect saying and doing nothing), and look at how quickly Bucknor acted in ejecting Osuna and Hale. Granted, warnings were in place so he had to run them in a sense. But make no mistake about the fact that umpires see the mannerisms displayed by players \xe2\x80\x93 both good and bad.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Watch your backMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

He struck out Russell Martin, Dioner Navarro, and Kevin Pillar \xe2\x80\xa6 but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that easy. A Navarro monster foul was reviewed to see if it hit the fair pole for a grand slam or not! Maybe it did just a little? But the call was not overturned. See what I mean by predestination?

Mandatory Credit: John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles fell behind early in Friday evening\xe2\x80\x99s series opener with the Jays 5-0, not getting a hit until the eighth inning. And though they would make it a one-run game with the 5-4 final score, for most of the night, the game felt like it was over practically from the beginning.To look at the two starting pitchers \xe2\x80\x93 Marco Estrada and Mike Wright \xe2\x80\x93 it is not the Blue Jays\xe2\x80\x99 hurler that you would pick to have the better stuff and results. Though he is listed as 6\xe2\x80\x990\xe2\x80\x9d, wearing the high socks makes him look much shorter. And it would seem he needs a tailwind to get a pitch to hit 90 mph. On the other hand, Mike Wright is 6\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d and can flat-out bring it to the plate. But it was the Orioles would could not get any good wood on the ball.Setting the tone for the evening and knocking Wright off the rails in the first inning was umpire CB Bucknor. When Wright grazed Joe Bautista with a running 2-2 fastball, immediately the benches were warned. Bucknor overreacted, and Jays Manager John Gibbons correctly was offended \xe2\x80\x93 ending with his own quick ejection. Two doubles quickly followed, with two runs scored, and Wright was all wrong after that.The inside of the plate was taken away, while at the same time, Bucknor was not giving Wright the outside corner. Soon, too many pitches were left up in the zone, and before long it was 4-0 and Wright was out of the game after getting only four outs. While Tyler Wilson would give the Orioles 5.2 good innings while only allowing one additional run, the mountain was made and Estrada was standing on it.Later in the game in the eighth inning, Adam Jones was hit by Roberto Osuna \xe2\x80\x93 resulting in his ejection and that of the Jays\xe2\x80\x99 substitute manager DeMarlo Hale. Yes, Jones would be the O\xe2\x80\x99s counterpoint to Joey Bats being hit. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone was attempting to hit anyone else on this night.

First of all, he was not around for all of the previous foolishness and excitement between the teams. The guy just wants to get outs and prove he can stay in the majors. And it was a 2-2 pitch!And the same with Jones being hit. Osuna is trying to get out of a jam and preserve a win for his team. He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to plunk Jones to put runners on base in front of Chris Davis (not that doing such turned out to be a very scary thing on this evening!).Certainly the umpiring crew was much aware of the previous tensions between these teams and were committed to jumping proactively on a problem at its first appearance. The problem is that in trying to prevent a problem, they threw gas all over it. Without a doubt, these two teams do not like each other at all, though they now likely agree that the umpiring was dreadful.Beyond the ejections, indeed, the plate umpiring by CB Bucknor was just awful. The strike zone was all over the place. The inconsistent and lousy performances by the guys in blue should certainly be a focus of MLB, though it never seems to happen.Understand, today\xe2\x80\x99s headline aside, the umpiring did not cost the Orioles the game \xe2\x80\x93 they lost it to the Blue Jays. And maybe some people like to watch a game with the silly drama that Bucknor created, but I felt like I wasted a good Friday night.\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

That brought Bautista to the plate again. While it appeared to be one of those baseball moments where nemesis\xe2\x80\x99 stare each other in the face, Bautista walked on four pitches.

Hardy came back to the plate with a shot to give his team the led. He followed up his game-tying play earlier with an RBI-single up the middle which seemed to confuse Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s middle infielders. Both thought the other would field the ball, but by the time they figured it out the ball was by them and Chris Davis was crossing home plate to give the Orioles a 10-9 lead.Hardy and Reimold would score a few moments later on an RBI-triple by Ryan Flaherty, who would score himself on Machado\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single. However this game was won by the Orioles on two things. First off, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day in the eighth. One might argue that the Orioles were afraid to let Bautista beat them, however that sly pitch-around was a key moment.Secondly, Hardy is one of the most professional hitters that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to find. He finds ways to get on base, and/or to get balls into the outfield. And he did it when the team needed it most this afternoon, giving the Orioles the game and the series.The only concern now of course is Chris Tillman, who was lifted after 1.1 innings. Buck Showalter said after the game that Tillman just needs to get back to attacking, as well as to straighten out his changeups and sliders. He also indicated that Tillman might get an extra day of rest with tomorrow being an off day in his next turn in the rotation.\xc2\xa0However Tillman aside, chalk this up as just \xe2\x80\x9cone of those games.\xe2\x80\x9d The ball was flying this afternoon in Toronto, and sometimes that\xe2\x80\x99s just how the game ebbs and flows. However make no mistake about the fact that this was about as big of a win for the Birds as one can imagine. It also gave them a series win, and they moved into third place in the AL East \xe2\x80\x93 only three games back.And the fact is that this is a resilent team, as all Orioles fans know.

Mandatory Credit: Peter Llewellyn-USA TODAY SportsI missed viewing all but the final inning of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Baltimore Orioles 13-9 win over the Toronto Blue Jays. It was truly a game where no lead was safe. This win, along with the improbable victory on Saturday could prove to be critical games as we look back on this season after the O\xe2\x80\x99s win the World Series.I chose instead on Sunday afternoon to check out the DelMarVa Shorebirds as they played a final game before their South Atlantic League break for the All-Star Game. They lost to the Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 local farm team, the Hagerstown Suns, by a 6-3 score. First baseman Derek Peterson crushed a two-run homer, but much of the rest of the game was a difficult effort for the O\xe2\x80\x99s affiliate. The Shorebirds finished the first half of the season at 33-35.Possibly the best part of the game was when the 25 or so Miss Maryland contestants \xe2\x80\x93 who were in town for the annual state pageant \xe2\x80\x93 dropped in at the game for a few innings. You gotta love minor league baseball. At the same time it was \xe2\x80\x9cBark in the Park\xe2\x80\x9d day, with people bringing their dogs to the game.So what is wrong with Chris Tillman, who got knocked out of Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game after merely 1 and 1/3 innings, giving up six runs on six hits? Ultimately, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer. Presuming there is not a physical issue that is not being revealed, one would presume he will eventually return to the reasonably effective pitcher we have known since the middle of 2012.One could speculate that one of the problems on Sunday was the long wait between the bottom of the first and the bottom of the second. In the top of the second inning, the Orioles sent 12 men to the plate and scored seven runs. That takes time. I do think it is a fair statement to make of Tillman that he is the most regimented of the O\xe2\x80\x99s starters. He is the guy who needs routines that are predictable \xe2\x80\x93 certainly he does between starts, and maybe even between innings.

Really? He might have done worse than Tillman did on Sunday?\xc2\xa0 This year, Tillman is now 0-3 against the Jays in four starts, giving up 25 runs in 15 innings for an ERA of 15.00.Overall for 2015, Chris is 5-7 with a 6.22 ERA. This is not what the Orioles expected of their presumptive top-of-the-rotation starter.You may recall that Tillman had a rough start in 2014. There were some very bad games, but he corrected things and ended with a strong season \xe2\x80\x93 particularly in the second half. Will he turn it around again?Actually, the hole that he is in right now is larger and a bit later than in 2014. The last time he had such a short outing as yesterday was in a game against Texas on June 5th of last year. It was his 13th start of the season; yesterday was #14 for 2015.But Tillman came back in his next start and only gave up one run in six innings. It was the first of nine consecutive quality starts, and 18 of 21 for the rest of the season.Will Tillman do this again this year? My guess is that he will figure it out, though I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit I would have thought such would be done by now. This is another situation where Showalter has a long memory of the track record, and Tillman is going to be given regular chances (provided there is not an unknown physical issue) just as Jimenez was last year. But the Orioles really need him to fix things; they cannot be counted upon to put up 13 runs every time he melts down.Next: God had to have predestined the O's 5-3 win over the Jays "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Tampa Bay Rays at Baltimore Orioles - USA TODAY', ""BALTIMORE -- Baltimore's Kevin Gausman pitched 7 2/3 innings of four-hit ball to pick up his first win this season as the Orioles extended the Tampa Bay Rays' losing streak to nine games with a 5-0 victory in the first game of a doubleheader Saturday.

"", 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Are the Birds unfair in their approach?', ""We end up talking about unwritten codes fairly often when the Baltimore Orioles play Toronto. Having said that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest; I read a lot of different columns and even message boards every day. Somewhat frequently, I see fans of other teams talk about how the O\xe2\x80\x99s are a team who feels it\xe2\x80\x99s their duty to \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d the unwritten codes of the game. Do they have a point?There are two manners in which one can look at this; the likes of Jose Bautista, David Ortiz, and others would probably say that if these unwritten rules are so important, someone should write them down. Until they do, they see no problem with showing up the other team on home run trots, and using dramatics to complain about being plunked.

And I make no bones about the fact that I stand on that side of the fence. Do we really need to see guys moonwalking around the bases on home runs? Speaking for myself, I say no. And I have no problem with teams enforcing those rules \xe2\x80\x93 and yes that means plunking hitters.But as I said, there\xe2\x80\x99s a school of thought amongst some fan bases which says that teams like the Orioles are seen as going overboard with this. But does this apply to opposing teams as well. Perhaps in some cases; some of the comments Bautista\xe2\x80\x99s made over time seem to indicate that he\xe2\x80\x99s not thrilled with being told by the Orioles in a passive-aggressive manner how to behave. But\xe2\x80\xa6where does justice lie?It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough line to toe for sure. If you show someone up on a home run trot or something of the like, your general attitude is one of shock when the opposing team has an issue with it.

I think you know what my answer is from reading the earlier parts of this article. However I would say this; ever wonder why Bautista plays so well against the Orioles?Some guys have the ability to play better when they\xe2\x80\x99re despised. Bautista knows the Orioles want to beat him. And he uses their disdain to his advantage. David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez did it for years as well. And if you look at the NFL, Hines Ward of the Pittsburgh Steelers had this ability with the best of them. While I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with the manner in which Bautista approaches the game, I do respect that ability.In my own life, I\xe2\x80\x99ve probably lost more as a result of disdain clouding my judgement than I\xe2\x80\x99ve won. If someone rubs me the wrong way, I\xe2\x80\x99ve often done everything in my power to beat them. And the worst part is that those people can generally see that I don\xe2\x80\x99t like them \xe2\x80\x93 and they use it to their advantage.For the record, this usually happens for legitimate reasons. I don\xe2\x80\x99t just blindly dislike people, and neither do Adam Jones and the Orioles. But it can often be to your detriment if you take it too far \xe2\x80\x93 and I often do, for what that\xe2\x80\x99s worth.\xc2\xa0But keep in mind that the unwritten codes are in fact there for a reason. And they\xe2\x80\x99re reflective of the values of American society in the golden age of baseball. Things were a bit kinder and gentler in that era. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the era of instant gratification in which we live today\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6which is why guys didn\xe2\x80\x99t pose after home runs, or savor their little moment as they rounded the bases. So while guys who do this today aren\xe2\x80\x99t breaking the rules per se, they\xe2\x80\x99re going against the grain of the way the game has always been. And yes, some teams aren\xe2\x80\x99t cool with that.

The club seems to have held the belief that they could replace what Markakis might offer the team for less than the four year, $44 million contract that he signed with Atlanta. The performance of the Orioles assortment of corner outfielders up to this point in the season has not made that look like a good bet. Markakis himself is having a decent season so far in Atlanta. The Orioles still do not miss him.    That's not to say that the skill-set that Markakis has surprisingly shown for the Braves so far this season would be unwelcome on the Orioles roster at present. Among players who've gotten regular playing time for the O's in 2015, Markakis would be in the lead with his .386 on-base percentage. It's not a particularly close second, either, with the next highest being Manny Machado's .361. If his performance was ported into the leadoff spot in the Orioles lineup, the offense would be better than it is, and so, in turn, would the team. Just from looking at his batting line of .293/.386/.354, you might think that it would be a no-brainer that Markakis would be leading off for the Braves. Actually, they have him hilariously miscast as a regular cleanup hitter, which is so totally absurd given that Markakis ranks 159th out of 165 qualified batters in ISO (BA - SLG), a stat that indicates a player's power. Not that the Orioles are doing much better than this, either, with frequent Delmon Young sightings in the cleanup spot. Young doesn't have enough plate appearances to qualify, but if he did, he'd rank 156th. Those who were left behind The problems with Young getting so much playing time on this year's O's are one of the things that make Markakis look tempting. Young is hardly the only one who is struggling. Another one of the O's corner outfield solutions that wasn't was Alejandro De Aza, who was so bad that the Orioles already cut ties with him even if it meant that most all of his $5 million salary for 2015 was a loss.    Between De Aza's money and the $2.25 million going to Young, that gets you most of the way to the $11 million that Markakis is making with the Braves this year. You get even closer to the $11 million when considering that, if the O's had signed Markakis, they probably would not have also traded for Travis Snider, who's making $2.1 million and cost two prospects.    It's not as simple as all of that. For one thing, Snider alone has been better than you probably realize, at least as far as the different Wins Above Replacement metrics are concerned. Snider came into Sunday's games with a 0.6 WAR on Fangraphs and a 1.5 WAR on Baseball Reference. Even taking the more pessimistic of these, fWAR, if Snider produces half the WAR of Markakis while making $9 million less, the Orioles are getting the better end there. Another thing worth considering is the sheer improbability that Markakis will sustain the performance he's had so far. Markakis is working with a walk rate that is nearly 50% higher than anything that he managed in any of the previous four seasons. Eventually, you figure, pitchers are going to wise up and realize that challenging Markakis to put the ball in play is a relatively safe plan. He has no home runs or triples, with his only extra base hits being 16 doubles in 303 PA.    His success when putting the ball in play is another area where he appears to be benefiting from good luck that can't last. When Markakis puts the ball in play, he has a batting average (BABIP) of .344, which is a number that is significantly higher than any other year in his career other than his career year of 2008, when he was nearly a .300/.400/.500 player. In the previous two seasons, Markakis had a BABIP that was slightly under .300. His career mark is .317. Regression is a not-nice word If that luck turns on him a bit and his batting average drops, bringing an already low slugging percentage even lower, he is going to have some major problems, and so will the team that's paying him $11 million per year through 2018. Markakis now holding the record for consecutive errorless games by an outfielder is not enough to offset that kind of regression to the mean. It is always possible that the Braves organization and Markakis together have unlocked some kind of new skill in his arsenal that he was not able to realize in his final years in Baltimore. The smart money would not bet on such a development occurring suddenly at age 31 after a general offensive decline in the previous seasons, but that doesn't mean it is impossible. If the Braves have really managed this, good for them. This is not likely to prove to be the case.    Even if Markakis were to actually sustain his current production for the life of the contract with the Braves, there's always the injury risk as well. He is a player on the wrong side of 30 who has had a number of different surgeries over the course of his playing career. If it had been the Orioles who gave him that contract, it would be the Orioles on the hook for the risk. The Orioles have not yet found their Markakis replacement in right field, but they do at least have the chance to continue trying to find something better. With Markakis there, they'd be locked in to him as their guy for all that money. Maybe the Nolan Reimold/Chris Parmelee tandem is the answer. Maybe it's not. They're still better off trying that than being stuck with the guy who, if we shave off the points from his slash line that his BABIP luck suggests may happen in the long run, would be batting about .266/.360/.328. And that's assuming that dopes pitching in the NL keep walking Markakis at the same rate once they realize how little he's likely to hurt them on a ball put in play. That looks a lot like an awful player waiting to happen. For all that the Orioles corner outfield has been a struggle, and for all that Markakis has done fine up to this point in his four year contract, the Orioles are still better off without him.

06/23/2015,"[('The promotion of Mychal Givens to the Baltimore Orioles is ...', ' It seems like the promotion of right-handed pitcher Mychal Givens got lost in the shuffle a bit last week, especially since the 25-year-old is still yet to make an appearance for the Orioles. However, the rate at which Givens has succeeded on the mound is something that should be noted. Plus, he spells the name ""Michael"" with a ""Y"". That\'s pretty freakin\' cool.    As you likely know by now, Givens was expected to make waves in Baltimore\'s system with his bat, not his arm. He was selected in the second round of the 2009 MLB Amateur Draft as a shortstop out of H. B. Plant High School in Tampa. However, over 362 minor league at-bats, including stints in Aberdeen, the Gulf Coast, Delmarva, Frederick and Perth (he spent some time in Australia after the 2011 season), Givens was slashing .263/.342/.343 with 156 strikeouts, 97 walks, 11 home runs and 102 RBI. Those numbers at the plate, while unimpressive, were not unsightly; Givens\' play in the field was. Even still, as a pitcher, Givens is a bit of a mess in the field. His career fielding percentage in the minors is .942. It was clear that the former highly-thought of prospect was at risk of becoming nothing more than the dreaded ""organizational player.""    Prior to the 2013 season, Givens made a change, and went from taking batting practice to throwing bullpens; a decision that has paid off in a big way.    To get a more in-depth understanding of the work Givens has put in and to read some encouraging quotes, check out a story that MASN\'s Steve Melewski did about a week ago. It\'s full of good stuff. Long story short, Givens recovered from a rocky start as a pitcher to being absolutely lights out so far in 2015. He has lowered his ERA from 4.22 in his first season on the mound to just 1.60 through 23 appearances, leading to 12 saves, 54 strikeouts and 11 walks over 39.1 innings. No longer does it seem that Givens has the control issues that plagued him in the early goings of his professional pitching career.    He has done it all with a motion that is somewhere between sidearm and submarine. The video below gives you a pretty good idea of what to expect from him should he ever emerge from the \'pen. Your browser does not support iframes. It\'s a bit of a vicious movement, but he has seemed to have found his sweet spot. Not to mention, he gets it up to 95 MPH from that arm slot. That is almost unfair. Most pitchers who deliver from below the belt sit in the mid to high 80\'s. Givens could be a special one. I will steal a quick excerpt from\xc2\xa0Melewski\'s piece here:    ""I\'m on board with whatever will make me get to the next level and help the Orioles win more ballgames,"" [Givens] said. At Bowie this year, [former\xc2\xa0Oriole Alan] Mills said Givens has been very coachable. ""He is always asking questions, always trying to get better and always trying to find a better way to do things,"" Mills said. ""He\'s learning how to pitch to guys, reading bats and swings, and understanding (pitch) sequences. He\'s been a pleasure to work with."" That sure sounds like a guy that could be easy to root for. So, while the Orioles bullpen is in fine shape right now, I hope that we can find a regular sport for Givens in the future. The most recent round of prospect lists I can find has Givens ranked all over the place.\xc2\xa0MLB.com puts him as the 16th-best prospect in the O\'s system. In January, Fangraphs ranked the top 24 prospects for the Orioles and Givens was listed among their version of ""honorable mentions."" Baseball America put him at #27 in the organization at the end of 2014. I would imagine that if they all re-did their lists right now, he would jump a few spots.

Mandatory Credit: Peter Llewellyn-USA TODAY SportsOver the years that have now accumulated of writing about the Baltimore Orioles, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m generally fairly positive about the team and the players. I want them to do well, and that comes through. But there are times when they go into a funk, and I feel the need to call out the truth about something that is not right. Yet overall, as Buck would say, \xe2\x80\x9cI like our guys.\xe2\x80\x9dAlong the way, however, it is true that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty hard on Ryan Flaherty. And as a commentor asked me, is it time that I lighten up on the guy? His numbers have been much improved of late.So has he finally \xe2\x80\x9carrived\xe2\x80\x9d as an everyday player? The hope was, going into the 2014 season with Brian Roberts then in the Yankees fold, that Flaherty would inherit the job. But then Jonathan Schoop showed up, and Flash was back to his utility role.Let me say that I have never been down on Flaherty for his defense. It is really excellent; he is a top level defensive performer. His versatility to play all over the field makes him a valuable commodity. He sticks with the team because his versatility is irreplaceable in any other package. Flaherty is a great utility man; but is he good enough to be an everyday player?

He even hit a home run in the playoffs.Right now, Flaherty is batting .248. In his first three years with the Orioles he hit .216, .224, and .221 \xe2\x80\xa6 all of which is pretty consistent (and very mediocre).But hitting instructor Scott Coolbaugh has been working with him to cut down on his big looping swing \xe2\x80\x93 to be more compact and straight to the pitch. And this seems to be working.For the month of June, in the 20 games of the Baltimore Orioles, Flaherty has been in all of them. He has an average of .246 with three triples, a homer, and 11 RBIs.\xc2\xa0 The Orioles are a combined 13-7 in those games.But perhaps the best is yet to come for Flaherty in June, and that is because the Orioles are going to Boston for three games this week. He seems to feel especially at home in Fenway \xe2\x80\x93 the MLB site where he attended most often as a boy growing up in Maine.Earlier this season Flaherty was 6-for-11 in Boston with two doubles and a home run. In 17 career games at Fenway, he is batting an even .400 with 24 hits in 60 at-bats. This far exceeds any other place he plays.So while I still see Jonathan Schoop as the second baseman of the future for the Orioles, I\xe2\x80\x99m good with Flaherty hitting .250 to .260 until Schoop returns.\xc2\xa0 It is the .215 stuff that gets me complaining.Next: What is wrong with Chris Tillman this year?

06/24/2015,"[(""If the Orioles' rivals in the AL East were Batman villains ..."", ' If you\'re not the sort of person who follows video games, be aware that the latest installment in the most successful superhero franchise going, Batman: Arkham Knight, came out yesterday. \xc2\xa0It\'s sort of a big deal. \xc2\xa0It\'s one of the biggest games coming out for the new generation of game consoles that\'s not being side-released on older consoles. \xc2\xa0It\'s a big, beautiful, ambitious game. \xc2\xa0It\'s so cool that -- hypothetically -- I can imagine a scenario where a once-a-week baseball blogger could get so consumed in Batmania that he would sort of forget his weekly responsibility and neglect to fully develop a blog post idea. \xc2\xa0So, uh, yeah. \xc2\xa0On a totally unrelated note, I put tons and tons of forethought into this week\'s theme of who the Orioles\' AL East rivals would be if they were Batman villains.    The Yankees are the Joker Of course they are. \xc2\xa0Because here\'s the thing about being an Orioles fan: No matter how much you want any other team in the East to lose at any given time, no matter how wrapped up you are in the game the Orioles are playing against someone else, you\'re really thinking about the Yankees losing, too. \xc2\xa0Beating the Yankees is sweeter and more important than beating anyone else. \xc2\xa0The Yankees are the primary object of our obsession, just as Heath Ledger was to Christian Bale\'s Batman. \xc2\xa0The Yankees and Red Sox fanbases will probably tell you that they are one another\'s Batman/Joker relationship, but screw those guys. The Rays are Two-Face A lot of Orioles fans have at least a semi-conflicted relationship with the Rays. \xc2\xa0Just as Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent were friends before Dent\'s fall from grace, many Orioles fans spent the dark years maybe not rooting for the Rays, but at least saying ""If we\'re not going to win it, I want them to win more than anyone else in the East."" \xc2\xa0And so maybe they have a soft spot for Evan Longoria or Desmond Jennings, even now that the Orioles are good and the Rays are a threat to their success. \xc2\xa0Also, it was always baffling how Two-Face was an effective threat to Batman when he left his decisionmaking to a stupid coin toss -- just as it makes no sense for the Rays, with no major offensive threat and half their rotation on the DL, to be right in the thick of the race this year (and every year). The Red Sox are the Penguin They\'re ugly. \xc2\xa0They\'re mean. \xc2\xa0They strut around with an air of superiority. \xc2\xa0It\'s almost too easy of a comparison to draw. \xc2\xa0The unfortunate thing about Penguin, also, is that he\'s all too real of a threat, and he\'s one of Batman\'s smartest and sanest adversaries, out to win for himself rather than merely to torment innocent people or the superhero. \xc2\xa0This parallels the Red Sox and their frustrating ability, in recent history, to win with seemingly mediocre free agents, then sell off those pricey assets and start over effectively. \xc2\xa0You hate the Yankees/Joker for being truly evil and a constant threat -- you hate the Red Sox/Penguin for being diabolical and building up plans that seem to hit you from nowhere occasionally.    The Blue Jays are the Riddler On paper, the Riddler probably ought to be Batman\'s greatest threat. \xc2\xa0Edward Nygma is the smartest Batman opponent, right? \xc2\xa0If you draw up a Batman story without knowing any history, just looking at everyone\'s strengths and weaknesses, Riddler is the guy you want to be most careful with. \xc2\xa0He\'ll ""win the offseason"" every time. \xc2\xa0But then the story actually starts, and he\'s just Jim Carrey, annoying the superhero and serving as a meaningful distraction, but not really ever worth focusing on as a primary threat. \xc2\xa0And the Riddler has a super annoying goon named Jose Bautista who can\'t handle being pitched inside, and he asks for a bunch of extra replays even when he\'s already used his challenge. \xc2\xa0Or something. \xc2\xa0The Riddler is annoying, is what I\'m saying. The Royals are Bane OK, they\'re not in the East, but seriously, ow, our backs. What do you think? \xc2\xa0Do I have any of the villains flipped around? \xc2\xa0Is there a Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, or Mr. Freeze out there that I didn\'t give enough consideration to? \xc2\xa0Let me know in the comments. \xc2\xa0I totally won\'t be ignoring the comments and playing Arkham Knight.

Combined they were 4-for-10 with a double, triple, homer and three RBIsGiven the pending return of several Orioles who have been on the disabled list, along with the large number of players being used on the 40-man roster, it would seem that at some point the Birds are not going to be able to keep all of these outfielders. Something has to give. Perhaps it will be Steve Pearce, Nolan Reimold or Delmon Young, though it is difficult to imagine the Orioles parting with any of them either.But for our purposes today, let\xe2\x80\x99s just compare the two power lefties: Chris Parmelee and Travis Snider.

Snider was the 14th overall pick by the Blue Jays, while Parmelee was #20 by the Twins.Career average, home runs, and on base percentage \xe2\x80\x93 Though Snider has twice as many at-bats, their overall average is almost the same. Parmelee has the edge by only two points. As well, the ratio of home runs is almost precisely the same, as well as the on base percentage.

But Parmelee is not able to become a free agent until 2019.Defensive Ability \xe2\x80\x93 Though Snider has played relatively good outfield defense this year, Parmelee is the better defender and probable better overall athlete and physique. He is also able to play first base, and not just the outfield.Overall SummaryUltimately the deciding factor is going to be how well they play.

The 1906 Chicago Cubs were 116-36 for 76%, and even then they lost the World Series.But the Baltimore Orioles have in fact won 75% of their past 20 games \xe2\x80\x93 going 15-5 since June 4th. Amazingly, while doing that, they have only gained 2.5 games on first place in the A.L. East.\xc2\xa0 But it has been a good run for sure, going from a record of 23-29 to the current level of 38-34.So what has made this possible? What factors and areas of the team may we particularly identify as contributory to this turnaround of a season that was headed down a bad road just three weeks ago?

And then the inference was (if not openly stated) that the O\xe2\x80\x99s had lousy starting pitching and were doomed to go nowhere.There is no doubt that any successful baseball club needs good starting pitching in the big and long-term picture of things. And there is no doubt that the 2014 O\xe2\x80\x99s did a season turnaround that largely coincided with the starters putting it all together in a cohesive rotation.But quite honestly over the past 20 games, the starters have not been that great. There have been some very good efforts for sure \xe2\x80\x93 like Wei-Yin Chen\xe2\x80\x99s eight shutout innings. But the Orioles starters have now gone six games in a row without a quality start. In fact, in only six of the 20 games we are looking at have the O\xe2\x80\x99s starters completed at least six frames.So, while there have been some good efforts, it is not the rotation overall that has carried Baltimore to these 15-of-20 wins.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireWas it the Power-Hitting Offense?After the Orioles chose to not re-sign Nelson Cruz, questions arose as to how they were going to cover the lost production. Over this 20-game period, the Orioles hit a total of 29 home runs. That is a pace for 235 homers in a year. The O\xe2\x80\x99s hit 214, 212, and 211 in the past three seasons. For the whole year, they are currently on pace to homer 194 times.However, over the past 20 games, eight of those 29 home run came in one game against the absolutely dreadful Philadelphia Phillies. So while the home runs have been nice additions at times, it is not what is driving the successes.Was it a Shutdown Bullpen?Much was made after last year with the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen that a new key to winning baseball in the modern era is to have a lights-out, shutdown bullpen that is filled with fresh arms who can dominate opposing hitters. This shortens games by giving opponents only six innings at best to get their offensive production done.I frankly think there is a great deal to be said about this. Of course, if the starters regularly get knocked out of games too early, it negates this strength. And likewise, if the offense if terribly weak, it cannot score enough to get leads or win games at the end.The Orioles bullpen had a rough first month of the season, ranking near the bottom in many categories. Yet since then, they have been arguably and statistically at the very top of MLB.And this is true over the past 20 games.

The Birds, who just finished a 5-3 road trip, have won 15 of their last 20 games to move to within two games of first place in the AL East.  At 38-34, the Orioles are a season-high four games over .500. Over their last seven series, they are an outstanding 6-0-1. They went 7-1 during their last home stand and don\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be slowing down. One of the main reasons that the Birds have been flying high has been their ability to hit with runners in scoring position.  For the season, the Orioles are hitting .320 as a team with RISP. That mark is the best in all of Major League Baseball. Over their last six games, they are hitting .441 (26-for-59) with RISP. DH Jimmy Paredes leads the majors with a .455 (20-for-44) average with runners in scoring position. C Caleb Joseph has been strong as well as he is hitting .361 (13-for-36) with RISP. The Orioles have scored 125 runs in June which is ranks second behind Toronto (137) in MLB. The fact that they hit well in the clutch obviously helps when it comes to run production.  If the Orioles can keep up this pace throughout the summer, they will be in contention until the end. Hopefully, the skill of hitting with RISP will ultimately help put them over the top in the division.  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Matt Wieters provided the spark', 'Gratned things started coming together in July, one would be hard-pressed not to notice the rise the Baltimore Orioles are making in the standings now and compare it to last year.

This led the Orioles and MLB to not waste any time in postponing the game for Saturday and making it up on Sunday.The first game on Sunday is sticking with the originally scheduled 1:35 start time.

First of all, it could have a negative effect on the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starting staff, as the team doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have an off-day until July 9th, so a sixth starter may be needed at some point in the coming days.Second, the Orioles are rolling.

Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s a scrappy team, even if their record might not necessarily indicate that in total. So Chris Davis and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had to know that they were in for a tough game when the Tribe came to Camden Yards last night \xe2\x80\x93 and a tough game they got.Wei-Yin Chen made his return last night after his \xe2\x80\x9csabatical\xe2\x80\x9d to the minor leagues. First off let me say that far too much was made of Chen being sent to the minors for a short period, That was partially due to Scott Boras\xe2\x80\x99 comments, however Chen had options, he struggled in Toronto, and the Orioles needed a roster spot. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple math. That aside, Chen had a couple of struggles last night, but ended up pitching well. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 7 H, 2 R, 2 BB, 5 K.

The Baltimore WireIf there\xe2\x80\x99s one criticism of Chen that one could make last night, it\xe2\x80\x99s that his slider wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fooling anyone. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not said so as to jump all over the guy; sometimes that happens. But a good pitcher will always adjust when it becomes obvious that a certain pitch isn\xe2\x80\x99t working \xe2\x80\x93 and Chen did that. However Cleveland took a 1-0 lead when Brandon Moss hit a solo homer off of one of Chen\xe2\x80\x99s sliders in the second inning.But the O\xe2\x80\x99s are a pretty scrappy team also if they choose to be. Unfortunately for them, this was a night where they had to be just that \xe2\x80\x93 as opposed to getting out to an early lead. In the last of the second J.J. Hardy put Cleveland on notice that the O\xe2\x80\x99s wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go into the night without a fight with a solo homer of his own to tie the game at one. I mentioned Chen\xe2\x80\x99s adjustments above; unfortunately they came one pitch too late in the sense that Ryan Rayburn smacked another Chen slider out of the park (with nobody on base) in the fourth to give Cleveland a 2-1 lead.Hardy would figure into the game a bit later as well, when the O\xe2\x80\x99s covered the corners with one out in the last of the sixth. Hardy was abe to get the ball in the air and deep enough to center field to allow Jimmy Paredes to score from third, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly had a 3-2 lead. However this Cleveland team wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere either, and Carlos Santana tied the game with his team\xe2\x80\x99s third solo homer of the day in the top of the eight.\xc2\xa0More from Chris Davis7/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Davis sets up win in the twilight zone6/27 - Baltimore Orioles complete the sweep of Tampa6/14 - Will Chris Davis Continue His Impressive Home Run Streak?6/10 - Baltimore Orioles: Comeback kids led by Chris Davis6/1 - Baltimore Orioles: Fair is foul, foul is fairKeep in mind folks, Orioles magic happens when you least expect it \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s always been one of the marks of the \xe2\x80\x9cmovement.\xe2\x80\x9d I would submit Delmon Young\xe2\x80\x98s bases-clearing double in the playoffs last year against Detroit as an example. So after losing the lead in the eighth last night, the Birds were left searching for that magic. And they found it \xe2\x80\x93 in the form of their big slugger.Jimmy Paredes led off the last of the eighth with a double, which brought ChrisCourtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsDavis to the plate with a runner in scoring position. Cleveland played Davis to center in this instance, ironically not paying any attention to the fact that Davis could pull the ball. But that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he did; a sharp liner into right field scored Paredes and gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 4-3 lead \xe2\x80\x93 which turned into a 4-3 win after the ninth inning.Maybe this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true Orioles magic in the sense that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a walk off. But the concept has always been about late-inning heroics. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what Chris Davis provided last night. The Orioles now stand a half game behind New York (who\xe2\x80\x99s in second place in the AL East), and one game out of first.\xc2\xa0The one concern is that Adam Jones was still unable to play last night, but Buck Showalter said that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to wait until tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game (weather permitting) to run him into the lineup. Jonathan Schoop is set to come off the DL at some point either today or tomorrow, so I suspect that if Jones can\xe2\x80\x99t play tonight he would go to the DL to make room for Schoop. However keep in mind that the DL stint would be backdated to last weekend, so Jones would be able to come off the DL in early July.The series continues tonight, that is if mother nature allows for it. Chris Tillman will once again try to get himself back on track with the start tonight, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s Cody Anderson.

It\xe2\x80\x99s strange to suggest that a team so much in contention deal away one of their most consistent starters, but it may be one of the better options right now.Chen is on the last year of his contract, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t be an Oriole next season. Baseball has seen a steady increase in pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s contracts for some time now, and the Orioles just aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to give Chen that kind of money.Moving Chen before the deadline could also bring the Orioles a decent return of prospects. Those are players the Orioles could use to replenish the roster next season when so many players are expected to leave via free agency.More importantly for the moment, it would free up a rotation spot for Gausman this season, and allow the future of the Orioles to develop a sense of routine and stability.It would take the perfect package for the deal to be considered, but dealing Chen may be best for the Orioles this season and beyond.\xc2\xa0Next: Baltimore Orioles win 5,000\xc2\xa0 "", 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: The Ups and Downs of Jimmy Paredes', ""May 26, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles designated hitter Jimmy Paredes (38) doubles during the sixth inning against the Houston Astros at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

He performed well, hitting .286 in 46 games.But in 2012 he did not make the Astros coming out of spring training; but for their AAA affiliate Oklahoma City he batted .318 with 13 homers in 124 games. He also swiped 37 bases. However, a late season call-up only saw him bat .189 in 24 games for Houston.This same story repeated in 2013. Paredes hit .287 at AAA, but with 48 games at Houston only .192.\xc2\xa0 This led to him being claimed off waivers in the offseason by the Marlins, then by the Orioles (for two days), and finally by the Royals.In 2014 the same basic story repeated of hitting well at AAA, but he only played in nine early season games for the Royals, going 2-for-10. Purchased by the O\xe2\x80\x99s in July, he was only hitting .258 at Norfolk when added to the roster for the rest of the Baltimore season. It was fresh air, as Paredes got into 18 games and went 16-for-55 for a .302 average.All totaled, he has posted a career .300 average in 307 AAA games in three organizations.

But yet again, he has picked up his stroke; and in the past 12 games he is a smoking hot .396 (higher than his OBP of .388 \xe2\x80\x93 being thrown out extending a hit, and registering no walks over that time).

How many batting stances did Cal Ripken have over the years?It would seem that Paredes (at age 26) is a fellow who is indeed \xe2\x80\x9cgetting it\xe2\x80\x9d and putting it together.

06/29/2015,"[('MLB Trade Deadline: The Orioles may not have much to buy ...', "" Hey, remember me? I'm the guy that wrote that article about\xc2\xa0the Orioles as sellers back on May 18th. Well since that date, the Orioles have gone 25-15 and from three games under .500 to seven games over .500 and hold first place in the AL East. To be fair to myself, I did not call for the Orioles to start selling, but that they needed to start winning if they wanted to avoid that fate and they have. A key deadline acquisition could be the key difference in a muddled American League. So now, what do the Orioles look like as buyers at the trade deadline? Three key questions and answers solve this problem.    What do you need? One of the more important things to figure out is what you need to buy. The Orioles could use a steadier hand in the starting rotation. Both Chris Tillman and Bud Norris have disappointed to date. Pushing either one of them from the starting rotation might be easier said than done. Furthermore, Kevin Gausman is waiting in the wings, as soon as the Orioles top screwing with him, to take a rotation spot and hold it down for good as he did in the back half of 2014. So while the solution may be in house, the Orioles still need at least one more reliable starter. The Orioles could also use an everyday corner outfielder. Right now they keep running out six guys for two spots which is untenable for much longer. Any of the current six options could be designated for assignment or traded. Having a outfielder they could plug and play everyday would give the roster a lot more flexibility and potentially, depending on who they traded for, a middle of the order bat. Yet, at least recently, the sextuplet of corner outfielders has produced. With the pressure on, almost all of them have preformed. Lastly, the bullpen, which has been very good, but I've never seen a bullpen that couldn't use an extra reliever. The Orioles could go after another setup man that could get both right handers and left handers out. The playoffs last year and every year show how crucial a shutdown bullpen can be. Adding another quality reliever to the Orioles current mix could not hurt.    What do you have to sell? Even if the Orioles found a player they wanted to add, they still need something to buy with. The Orioles do not have a great minor league system. Two of the biggest trade chips going into the season, Dylan Bundy and Hunter Harvey are both injured and do not seem to be returning to action anytime soon. Furthermore, because of the injuries both have to have an all time low in value. After that is Gausman, who is more likely to earn his own spot in the 2015 rotation or get continually jerked around until a spot opens up in 2016.    The only true prospects left from there in the minor league system are Jomar Reyes and Chance Sisco who are good hitting prospects. Neither are elite level talents and the Orioles need any positional help they can get in the minor leagues. So, not much is going to be bought with the Orioles prospects. That really only leaves the major league roster to subtract from. The only player of really any value that I see likely to get traded for anything of substance would be Steve Pearce. His ability to play in the infield and outfield makes him more valuable than a similar caliber hitter. The other corner outfielders are more of the designated for assignment and then traded for a bucket of balls ilk. Although, what makes Pearce valuable to everyone else also makes him valuable to the Orioles.    Chris Davis might be an interesting target for a team looking for left handed bat. Going into free agency it might make some sense to trade Davis. It would have to be in the right deal though as Davis is hitting well and has some versatility between playing first base and right field. Again though, the Orioles would have to deal with losing Davis' production. Norris could also see the trading block, but he has preformed so poorly that trading him would really just be opening up a spot for Kevin Gausman, which come to think of it might be valuable for the Orioles this year and long term. How do you make room? So even if the Orioles wanted to buy, they would have to make room on their current 25 man roster which they seem hard pressed to do right now. A trade or two would probably have to happen to make room in the outfield or in the starting rotation. Tillman was the defacto ace going into the season and moving him to the bullpen is not a move I see Buck Showalter making.    Norris could move to the bullpen, where I personally believe he could flourish. If the Orioles would rather trade him, Norris will be a reasonably priced two month rental. Again though, I do not see a magnificent return for Norris. Norris may be the one to get the pothole treatment and come back in mid-August as a bullpen arm. In the corner outfield multiple guys would have to be moved if the Orioles acquired an everyday corner outfielder. They seem reluctant to let go of one right now. They could pick two of the current six and platoon them in one of the corners. That would make some sense. Making room in the bullpen is easy, the Orioles have shown that for four years. What does that all mean? It probably means that the Orioles will not do very much at the deadline. With an American League so muddled this is a sellers' market and they have little to buy with and not much to gain. Trading for a starting pitcher when the Orioles have Gausman, who pitched well for the team last year, would be a little asinine. Trading for an everyday corner outfielder makes sense. But, again, the Orioles would probably have to trade Gausman/Davis/Pearce and probably their best two position prospects to get a player deserving of playing everyday over what they currently have. This doesn't make much sense either with the way the current group is playing    The only move I really see the Orioles making is a for a reliever. A middling prospect or two for a seventh/eighth inning setup arm is a trade Dan Duquette has made before and will make again. Also, some August waiver deadline deal seems likely as Duquette has shown a propensity for adding in August. He'll once again attack the depth of the minor league system, but try to keep the top intact. Obviously, if an injury occurs and a spot opens up, a lot of this changes. It may even still be to early to decide whether or not these Orioles are buyers come July 31st. However, if they are still in contention, I would not expect the Orioles to do much. The lack of minor league depth means the Orioles won't be big buyers on the market.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsIt was a long but beautiful Sunday for the Baltimore Orioles as they swept the Cleveland Indians 4-0 and 8-0. Ubaldo Jimenez threw eight innings, with Chris Tillman following with seven complete frames. The explosive O\xe2\x80\x99s offensive did their explosive thing, and two more wins go into the books for the Birds.It is the first time since 1974 that the Baltimore Orioles won a doubleheader and shut out the opponent in both games \xe2\x80\x93 2-0 and 1-0. Forty-one years ago it was also the Indians on the receiving end \xe2\x80\x93 in Cleveland.The date was September 6, 1974. Dave McNally pitched a complete game three-hitter in the opener, with the first O\xe2\x80\x99s run coming in the eighth inning by right-fielder Enos Cabell for the 2-0 win. Mike Cuellar threw a five-hit shutout in game two with the only fun of the game scored by Mark Belanger in the seventh inning.The previous occasion where the Orioles completely shut out opponents in a doubleheader was not nearly as long as 41 years. In fact, it was amazingly only four days prior against the Boston Red Sox. Both games had scores of 1-0, and each were complete game shutouts by Ross Grimsley on three hits and Mike Cuellar on two hits.There was only one game between these two doubleheaders, and it too was a complete game shutout by Jim Palmer. These five shutouts were in the midst of a 10-game winning streak that took the Orioles from a 63-65 record to 73-65. Those were great days. By way of comparison, there have been a grand total of 13 shutouts in the whole American League so far this entire season.

This is crazy.Last year the Orioles moved up in the standings to gain a tie at the top of the A.L. East in their 85th game of the season. It was on July 3rd \xe2\x80\x93 at the end of a four-game sweep of the Texas Rangers. The Rangers are in town for the next four nights. At that point in 2014, the O\xe2\x80\x99s were 46-39.

The Orioles have been playing tremendous baseball lately. They're now at a season high seven games over .500 and in a tie for first place in the division Tampa Bay (though ahead of them in the loss column). Their latest accomplishment was a three game sweep of the Indians in which they outscored them 16-3. If you go back to when things really started to turn around for them during their first series against the Indians in Cleveland, they've now won 17 of their last 22 games. They did the same thing last season between August 25th and September 16th, and that run was enough for them to clinch the division. This time, it's enough for them to take a share of first place. Perhaps most impressive is the way they've been winning, increasing their average run differential per game from -0.07 to +0.72. It's hard to complain about any of that.    The Rangers have not been playing well lately. They're 2-8 over their last ten, but still find themselves in 3rd in a surprisingly weak division. Houston is still leading it, the Mariners and A's have been very disappointing, and for a team that (like the O's) clinched their division with about two weeks left to go last season, the Angels are just kind of hanging around in 2nd. They currently have a 38-38 record. Pitching Matchups: Monday: Bud Norris vs. Wandy Rodriguez     2015    W/L   IP   ERA+   FIP   WHIP   SO/W     Norris   2-6   49.2   58   4.80   1.611   1.94     Rodriguez   4-3   68.2   99   4.12   1.383   2.08     Norris' early season struggles continue to drag down his numbers. Maybe we should look at his stats since coming off the DL?            W/L   IP   ERA   SO  BB HR    Norris   1-2  22.1 2.82 17 5 3       That's not terrible. Of course, that ERA is artificially low because he wasn't charged with any earned runs in his last start against the Red Sox, even though anyone who watched that game knows that's misleading. But he did look good in the first four innings of that game. He may do OK in this game too. The Rangers best hitter, Prince Fielder, is only 6 for 23 lifetime against him, including just one home run. Still though, I think its only a matter of time before Norris finds himself in the bullpen to make room in the rotation for Kevin Gausman. Most starters tend to struggle as they face the lineup for the 2nd or 3rd time, but this is especially true of Norris, likely making him better off the bullpen. Rodriguez is in his first year with the Rangers. Even though his 4-3 record isn't that impressive, the Rangers have won the game in 8 of his 12 starts. His last start was pretty bad - he gave up eight runs in four innings to the A's. He's given up at least one earned run in every appearance this season and hardly has a dominant strikeout ratio. If I had to guess, I'd say the Rangers are winning in his starts overall because he's been able to limit home runs - he's only given up seven in 12 starts, and three of those have come in his last two. He's only pitched in one game in Camden Yards previously, but he did give up four earned runs in that one. It's hard to see the Orioles having much trouble against him.    Tuesday: Miguel Gonzalez vs. Colby Lewis     2015    W/L   IP   ERA+   FIP   WHIP   SO/W     Gonzalez   6-4   78.0   109   4.60   1.154   2.63     Lewis   7-3   94.1   98   3.46   1.198   3.55     Gonzalez didn't do well in his last start in Boston, giving up four earned runs in five innings. He's definitely had a very up and down, but continues to outperform his FIP in record setting fashion. Last year he led the majors in difference between ERA and FIP at -1.66 and so far this year it's at -1.02. That's probably more in line with with a lot of starting pitchers right now, but it's not like he's dropped all the way down to only a few tenths of a point. Proving he can keep it up will go a long way to letting him keep his position in the rotation going forward. For anyone who thinks it could be in question - remember Gausman and Bundy are almost certainly locks to be added in next year, Jimenez and Tillman will still be around, and none of those guys pitch left-handed - and the Orioles are going to need at least one lefty...and I don't see Gonzalez magically becoming one over night. As for Lewis, that 7-3 record is kind of misleading. It mostly has to do with getting 5.78 runs per game in support. He's still been one of the better starters for the Rangers this season, who are missing Yu Darvish to a season long injury. He has been on kind of a roll too...since giving up nine earned runs in 2.2 innings to the Indians at the end of May, he's made five consecutive quality starts. Most of the Orioles have seen him a fair amount and J.J. Hardy leads the way with a 5 for 15 record, including two home runs.    Wednesday: Wei-Yin Chen vs. Nick Martinez     2015    W/L   IP   ERA+   FIP   WHIP   SO/W     Chen   3-4   87.0   134   4.13   1.149   3.62     Martinez   5-4   90.1   118   4.60   1.384   1.58     Maybe you don't put much stock in W/L, ERA, or FIP for a pitcher - fair enough. But look those WHIP and SO/W for Martinez...those are bad for a guy who's pitched 90 innings this season. He is a young guy, having only made his MLB debut last season. But based on how that low SO/W he seems to have command issues, and that's backed up by the fact that he's already hit 12 batters this season. In his last five starts, he's been charged with 20 earned runs. Ouch. So Chen got optioned for one start, didn't seem too happy about it, but then came back and pitched six pretty good innings against the Indians last Friday. Chen's biggest problem this season (other then getting low run support from the offense) has been his split against righties. His OPS and SO/W against righties drops a little as opposed to lefties, but he's given up 11 home runs to the righties. This is definitely happening at a higher rate than his career numbers. Fortunately, the Rangers feature five lefties in their starting lineup. Thursday: Yovani Gollardo vs. Kevin Gausman     2015    W/L   IP   ERA+   FIP   WHIP   SO/W     Guasman   1-0   17.0   94   4.22   1.235   2.33     Golardo   7-6   96.0   147   3.47   1.156   2.50     The Orioles haven't officially announced Gausman as the starter for Thursday, but the speculation on Sunday was that he would be brought up since none of their regulars would have enough rest due to the double header. He's only made one other start this season (against the Blue Jays) but he did OK, going five innings and giving up two runs. Like I said before, I expect Gausman to make his way into a regular spot in the rotation at some point this season, and he showed last season he can hold his own. That said, everyone expects that at some point he'll do more than that and be the dominant starter the Orioles have been lacking for a while. Not sure how this start will go, the Rangers score a lot of runs and have some good hitters. It'll be appointment viewing for any Orioles fan though.    Making it harder on Gausman will be going up against the Rangers best starter in Golardo. Again, don't look at his win/loss record. His ERA has been very good to go along with a pretty decent FIP, and that WHIP is pretty good too. Like the other Rangers starters, he's been good about limiting home runs, but that may have to do with their home park in Texas, which has the 18th lowest HR factor per ESPN. But no one on the Orioles has recorded a home run off of him and it's anyone's guess how he'll do at Camden Yards, this will be his first career start here. Other Notes: - The double header on Sunday was impressive, not just because the Orioles shut out the Indians, but because Tillman and Jimenez combined for 15 innings, 13 strikeouts, and 0 walks. Coming into Sunday, only in one other game this season has an Orioles starter gone seven innings and then they do it twice in the same day. And coming into the weekend, the Indians led the AL in walks. If the starting pitching keeps that up and the offense continues playing the way it has, the sky's the limit for this team. - The high strikeout numbers may continue for Orioles pitchers, the Rangers are 2nd in the AL in that category. - In my last preview I suggested Manny Machado might be in the running for MVP. Against the Indians he went 4 for 12 including a home run. Not a bad series. - Now that Prince Fielder his healthy, he's having a very good year in Texas, hitting .349/.416/.539 and his by far their best hitter. Another guy to lookout for might be Mitch Moreland, but otherwise they have a collection of decent, but not great hitters.    - The Orioles would do well to run the Rangers starters out of the game early - their bullpen has the worst ERA in the AL, and 2nd worst in MLB. Their closer, Shawn Tolleson, isn't bad but the rest of the bullpen probably isn't anything to worry about. Prediction: The Orioles have been playing so well lately it's hard to pick them to lose any one game, but over the course of four games you have to figure they'll lose at least one - it's very hard to sweep a team in four games. But I think that's the worst they'll do - they win three of four.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Hardy \xe2\x80\x93 two of the meek who will inherit the earth \xe2\x80\x93 were frustrated and complaining.Beyond that, umpire John Hirschbeck was simply awful on this evening. No, it was not the difference in the game, but it was a distraction all around. The Rangers were nearly as frustrated as the Orioles. Even Ryan Flaherty and J.J. Hardy \xe2\x80\x93 two of the meek who will inherit the earth \xe2\x80\x93 were frustrated and complaining. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure when I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen a strike zone so low (and outside too). Simply crazy \xe2\x80\x93 inches below the knees.Palmer commented at length on this as well, speaking of the wide-spread inconsistencies, and of remedies the league could undertake to work toward a consistent zone from umpire to umpire. It does not happen. And on nights like this, it really distracts from the game.Hirschbeck is no stranger to controversy. Here is an article from spring training this year that talks about strike zone bantering that went on between Hirschbeck and Norris.

Nothing would fall in, hard-hit balls went right at people, etc.\xc2\xa0 Even though the O\xe2\x80\x99s got nine hits, they left nine on base. And for a team that leads the world in RISP clutch hitting, they were only 1-for-9 against Texas.Back to Norris:\xc2\xa0 He now has a 6.79 ERA on the season. Some fans are calling for him to go to the bullpen, in the model of Ubaldo Jimenez last year. That day may come, but Buck has a long memory of what players have done in the past and is slow to make such moves. Other fans are ready to see him DFA-ed, especially in the current context of the roster crunch and the great interest there is in seeing Kevin Gausman added to the rotation.Honestly, Norris must not still have any lingering effects of the sickness that took him down earlier this spring. His fastball was hitting 95 and 96 even at the end of his outing. Command of off-speed pitches was the issue tonight, as well as throughout this season.However, his previous two starts \xe2\x80\x93 though losses \xe2\x80\x93 were both quite good, allowing only two earned runs in 11.2 innings on 12 hits and three walks. He has not gotten any run support in any of his three recent losses.I personally like Bud as much as any of the Orioles. His competitive spirit is totally awesome in my book! But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think his talent is at the top of class. To succeed, he has to walk a fine line rather perfectly, having good command and avoiding mistakes. This is what he is not doing. My guess is that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have until the All-Star break to find it, or he\xe2\x80\x99ll be pitching out of the bullpen.Next: The ups and downs of Jimmy Paredes ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Checking in with notable former Baltimore Orioles prospects', ' Yesterday was no fun in Birdland. Yes,\xc2\xa0the Orioles fell to the Texas Rangers by a score of 8-1, however, the much, much, much worse news is likely the fact that\xc2\xa0right-handed pitching prospect Dylan Bundy is being shut down indefinitely. It is just the latest in a string of disappointing news with not only Bundy himself, but, it feels like, every notable\xc2\xa0Oriole pitching prospect in recent memory.    So, it made me wonder a few things. It seems fairly easy to keep track of which Oriole prospects are doing well. Either they will be brought up during the MASN and radio broadcasts, they will be lucky enough to have a Camden Chat article written about them (jokes) or, quite simply, you will see them in an Oriole uniform. But it\'s tough when the O\'s trade away a youngster. We never hear about them again until/if/when they get to the Bigs. It would be great if a blogger out there would take some time to compile a partial list of former baby birds and update me on their progress. Well, ""past me"", have no fear because that is exactly what I plan to do. Keep in mind, this list will certainly not be exhaustive. I\'m probably going to forget someone. If you want, give me a friendly little reminder in the comments and I will try my darnedest to add it. Also, this is not all of Orioles history, lets just say five years or so. If they aren\'t making news by now, they likely don\'t have a prayer. Without further ado, here are your Orioles that never were...    Catcher, Brian Ward -Traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers along with right-handed pitcher Ryan Webb on April 9, 2015 in exchange for right-handed pitcher Ben Rowen and catcher Chris O\'Brien    The 29-year-old out of Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho seems to be not much more than an organizational player. He is currently playing with Triple-A Oklahoma City, where he is slashing .208/.351/.351 with three home runs and 13 RBI. It makes sense because he was never a hot prospect for the O\'s, but Baseball America did anoint him the Best Defensive Catcher in their system following the 2012 season. Left-handed pitcher Steven Brault -Traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on February 20, 2015 as the ""player to be named later"" along with left-handed pitcher Stephen Tarpley to complete the January 27, 2015 trade for outfielder Travis Snider    In his time with the O\'s, Brault pitched well enough for BA to rank him as the 14th-best prospect in Baltimore\'s system in 2013. The following season he dropped to 18th. He began his 2015 with High-A Bradenton for Pittsburgh, where he pitched to a 3.02 ERA over 13 starts and 65.2 innings, striking out 45 and walking 21. Since then, he has been promoted to Double-A Altoona. There he has a 3.48 ERA over just 10.1 innings. Left-handed pitcher Stephen Tarpley -Traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on January 27, 2015 along with a player to be named later (Brault) in exchange for Travis Snider Tarpley\'s career thus far is chugging along right at the speed of most normal prospects. With the Birds, he spent his first season in the Gulf Coast. The next year he went to the New York-Penn League. And now, he is in the Sally League with Pittsburgh\'s Single-A team, West Virginia. Thus far, he has a 2.83 ERA over seven starts and 35 innings. As an Oriole, Baseball America ranked him as their 16th-best prospect.    Catcher Mike Ohlman -Traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for cash on February 3, 2015 The 24-year-old has been a professional since 2009, and he is still a little bit younger than his competition at Double-A Springfield. Ohlman is a former 11th-round selection in the draft and was once a top-10 prospect for the Orioles. In the minors, he is a career .263/.351/.396 slasher. He is having a nice season with Springfield, hitting .297 with seven home runs and 40 RBI, but he is hardly pushing Yadier Molina out from behind the dish in St. Louis anytime soon. Left-handed pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez -Traded to the Boston Red Sox on July 31, 2014 in exchange for left-handed pitcher Andrew Miller Man, the Orioles sure are unloading a lot of southpaw pitchers, aren\'t they? This one may hurt more than all of the rest. He was a top-five prospect for the O\'s and in the top 100 in all of baseball. Following the trade, E-Rod proceeded to tear up the Boston minor league system, pitching to a 0.96 ERA over six starts for Double-A Portland in 2014. He has made it to Boston this season and has made six starts, including one against Baltimore. While he did get lit up in that game, the potential is obvious. Outfielder Xavier Avery -Traded to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for outfielder Michael Morse on August 30, 2013    Avery is a former second-round pick and ranked as high as the number three prospect in the O\'s system and even made it to Baltimore back in 2012 for a 32-game stint in which the then-22-year-old struggled. Now 25, Avery hasn\'t been back in the bigs since. He now plays for Detroit\'s Triple-A affiliate in Toledo, where he is hitting .299/.362/.388 with one home run, 13 stolen bases and nine caught stealing. Outfielder L.J. Hoes -Traded to the Houston Astros along with left-handed pitcher Josh Hader in exchange for right-handed pitcher Bud Norris on July 31, 2013 Hoes was a third-round draft pick back in 2008 and, at one time, was a top-five prospect for the O\'s. In the minors, he is a career .291 hitter. But that has not translated to consistent Major League success. Still with Houston, Hoes has had his ups and downs, hitting .287 over 46 games in 2013, but then hitting just .172 over 55 games the following year. Currently, he is hitting .335/.417/.462 with Triple-A Fresno. Another chance in the bigs is beckoning, but Houston is much better now than when Hoes was brought on board. Left-handed pitcher Josh Hader -Traded to the Houston Astros along with outfielder L.J. Hoes in exchange for right-handed pitcher Bud Norris on July 31, 2013 Another lefty? Goof lord! What\'s worse is that this guy is continuing exactly what he did with the Orioles, defying expectations and moving ridiculously fast through the minors. Right now he is with Double-A Corpus Christi, where, at 21 years old, he is three-and-a-half years younger than the average player in the Texas League. The former 19th-round selection out of Old Mill High School in Millersville, Maryland is Houston\'s 10th-best prospect according to BA. Not something to scoff at in an organization that has shown this year that it knows how to develop talent.    Third baseman Nick Delmonico -Traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for right-handed pitcher Francisco Rodriguez on July 23, 2013 It has been a rough go for Delmonico as a professional baseball player. In two seasons with Delmarva and Frederick, he failed to impress on the stat sheet. Things continued that way with the Brewers, reaching a low when he was\xc2\xa0suspended for 50 games (amphetamines) last July. He will be 23 years old in a few weeks and now plays for Double-A Birmingham in the White Sox organization, where he is also a full-time first baseman. Catcher Gabriel Lino -Traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with right-handed pitcher Kyle Simon in exchange for designated hitter Jim Thome on July 1, 2012 This was not a name I recognized right away, but it was part of a fairly significant trade. At one time, BA had Lino as the O\'s 21st-ranked prospect. He turned 22 years old in May and is currently with Triple-A Lehigh Valley, where he is hitting .279/.306/.353. The Phillies are awful, so Lino may get a chance at some big league ball in the next season or two. Right-handed pitcher Kyle Simon -Traded to the Philadelphia Philles along with catcher Gabriel Lino in exchange for designated hitter Jim Thome on July 1, 2012    Simon was a top-20 prospect for the Birds at the time he was traded to Philly. He made it to Triple-A Lehigh Valley in 2014, but struggled over 10 games and was released at the season\'s end. Currently, Simon is out of affiliated baseball, pitching for the Lancaster Barnstormers in the independent Atlantic League. Third-baseman Josh Bell -Traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for a player to be named later on April 21, 2012 I recall so much hype around Bell. In fact, BA had him as the O\'s second-best prospect back in 2009 behind only Brian Matusz, but in front of Zach Britton, Jake Arrieta and Caleb Joseph. And who could forget the famous arm sleeves he put on just to run the bases to protect his tattoos? Ah memories. Things never worked out in Baltimore and they didn\'t get much better in Arizona. He is currently 28 years old and playing in the Mexican League. That\'s it. I kept researching back to the end of the 2010 season. At that point, I wasn\'t recognizing many names and a lot of them didn\'t even have hyperlinks on MLB.com, which can\'t mean anything good happened in their baseball careers. For many of these guys, it is too early to say whether the Orioles made a good move or not. One or two are certain to comeback and bite them, but that\'s the way baseball goes. If I missed someone, failed to elaborate or you have a personal favorite former Oriole prospect let me know in the comments down below or on Twitter @_TyYoung. Thanks for reading.

07/01/2015,"[('Orioles minor league rundown 6/30: Walkoffs, walkoffs ...', ' Norfolk Tides 2, Charlotte (White Sox) 1 The game was 0-0 until the ninth inning. The Knights scored a run off of Eddie Gamboa, who was serving in his fourth inning of long relief, leaving the Tides and their four hits all game facing a 1-0 deficit and suddenly needing to pull together some magic to prolong the game. Down to the last out, Sean Halton came to the plate with two men on base and he decided to say forget about prolonging the game. Halton hit a two-run double to give the Tides both the tie and the walkoff win in dramatic fashion.    They only got six hits all game. Norfolk made them count. The tough luck no-decision went to Zach Davies, who started the game for the Tides and pitched the first five innings. He had a nice game as well, holding the Knights to two hits and three walks, although he only struck out one batter. Gamboa grabbed the win after his four innings of work, allowing a run on a hit and two walks. Gamboa also struck out one batter. Akron (Indians) 5, Bowie Baysox 2 The 2015 season really has not been a kind one to Baysox starter Tim Berry, who was on the wrong end of yet another tough outing on Tuesday. Berry gave up five runs, all earned, in six innings of work. He allowed six hits and four walks and only struck out two batters. He sits at this point in the season with a 7.75 ERA. Ouch. Recent favorite in this space Trey Mancini returned to the lineup for Bowie after missing several days with food poisoning. He went 1-4 in the game. He\'d been super hot before the interruption. Let\'s hope that doesn\'t cool him off. Corban Joseph, brother of Caleb, and Ozzie Martinez both had multi-hit games for the Baysox. Ben Rowen, the side-armer in the Ryan Webb trade, pitched the last inning for Bowie, striking out two batters. Rowen has a 2.28 ERA with the Baysox.    Wilmington (Royals) 1, Frederick Keys 0 The lone run in this contest scored in the top of the first inning. This does not look like it was a thrilling baseball game - although the teams combined for 18 hits, so at least there was that. Mikey ""Chief"" O\'Brien put together a solid game for the Keys, allowing six hits and a walk in seven innings of work. Unfortunately, one of those six hits happened to be a solo home run, and that was that for the Keys, although they did at least get 10 hits themselves.    Catcher Chance Sisco had a good game at the dish for Frederick, picking up three hits in four at-bats. He also coughed up a passed ball, his fourth of the season. Outfielder Josh Hart had a two hit game. Top of the Orioles 2013 draft, represent. Delmarva Shorebirds 4, Lakewood (Phillies) 3 A two run home run hit by Delmarva catcher Yermin Mercedes proved to be the difference in the game. Mercedes had two hits in the game and also threw out both attempted base stealers, so congratulations to him for an excellent night. In 15 games since joining the Shorebirds, he has a .769 OPS. He is 22, a bit old for the level, but hey, it\'s something.    Stephen Wilkerson had two hits for Delmarva, including a double, and also stole his eighth base of the season. In the Shorebirds pen, Nick Cunningham and Garrett Cortright combined to shut out the BlueClaws for the final 3.2 innings of the game. Aberdeen IronBirds 3, Batavia (Marlins) 2 (12 innings) The two teams each scored two runs in the fifth inning and then nobody scored again until extra frames, with the IronBirds getting themselves a walkoff victory on a walkoff... uh, throwing error? That\'s short season A-ball for you. Right before the throwing error there was a wild pitch putting the winning run on third base with two outs, too. Randy Gassaway had three of Aberdeen\'s nine hits. 2015 13th rounder Cedric Mullins had a pair of hits as well, including a double. Mullins has been hitting leadoff for Aberdeen and is batting .333/.364/.405.

', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles designate Delmon Young for assignment, recall ...', "" Baseball rosters are a zero sum game, and adding someone means that someone else must be taken off. The Orioles, you have probably noticed, have been flush with corner outfielders for some time, not all of whom are performing well. They are also currently short-handed in the bullpen, having only six relievers and no long relief man. All of this means that Delmon Young's time has finally run out. He was sent to the great DFA in the sky.    The corresponding roster move made was recalling Norfolk starter Tyler Wilson back to the big leagues. Wilson figures to serve in the long relief role for as long as he's in the O's 'pen this time around. Since the O's will be recalling Kevin Gausman to make Thursday's start, it's quite possible this will be a one game stay for Wilson. He'll be back again. Thanks for that clutch double in the ALDS last year, Delmon. You'll always have a place in Orioles lore. Unfortunately, that .628 OPS just isn't going to cut it any longer, not when there are better options with more positional flexibility. The $2.25 million salary that Young receives this year looks to be another bad offseason bet by the O's. Another player who might have seemed like a possible candidate to come up short in this game of musical chairs is Nolan Reimold. However, before the roster move was made, Orioles beat writers indicated that Reimold will be going on the paternity list following Sunday's game against the White Sox. That means that they can replace him on the roster for up to three days, and you know they'll use the full three days to see if someone gets injured.    Reimold going on the paternity list could be the chance they seize to add Jonathan Schoop back onto the roster, and by the end of that time, they will be near where they can give someone the old option over the All-Star Break move so that multiple of the ten days they must stay in the minor leagues will be days where there's no major league games anywhere. Designating Young for assignment means that the Orioles have ten days to pass him through waivers, trade him, or release him. They managed to off-load Alejandro De Aza in a post-DFA trade already this year. Maybe they'll manage it again with Young. The Baltimore Sun's Dan Connolly\xc2\xa0indicated that the O's have been trying to gauge trade interest in Young.

07/03/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: A Place of Beginning Again', 'Jul 2, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; A general view of the game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Texas Rangers during the sixth inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles are at it again. What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Getting shut out? Well, yes, there is that. It happened last night for the sixth time in 2015. This seems to be occurring more frequently than in the past, though actually, I was surprised to research that they were shut out 13 times last year. In 2013 it was six times, in 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 nine times, and in 2011 \xe2\x80\x93 seven times.To be championship outfit, a team needs to figure out how to beat the best and hottest pitchers. The Orioles did this with the Tigers in the playoffs last year, but too often they are shut down.Actually, what the Orioles have done again is give a player with a challenging track record that includes some personal indiscretions a chance to renew his career and life. Beyond that, apart from foolish life choices, the Orioles have also been a place where some players are being given a new chance to revitalize a career that has gotten stuck in the mud.Of this latter category, the list goes on and on: Jimmy Paredes, Chris Parmelee, Brad Brach, Delmon Young, Nolan Reimold, Bud Norris, Evan Meek \xe2\x80\xa6 just to name a few.But of the former category, I really respect how the organization is redemptive without being crazy about it. A player who has made a mistake or two, upon evaluation and consideration of his attitude and recovery, is occasionally welcomed to become a valuable asset again.The most famous of these, and the one that paid off the richest dividends was of course that of Nelson Cruz last year. Everth Cabrera was another who had a stain, and a list of lesser players could be produced. And then there is the internal situation with Chris Davis. Buck often says that none of us would want to have our whole lives judged by the worst moment and lowest point. That\xe2\x80\x99s a good line that has the additional advantage of being the truth.Yesterday the Orioles signed former All-Star reliever Chris Perez to a minor league deal, even though he is on a 50-day suspension for a second substance violation. There is a known marijuana situation from a couple of years ago. Perez will join the organization in Sarasota, where I suspect much more than baseball rehabilitation is on the regular agenda. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to rebuild it all, and if he does, the Orioles will have something; and if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, he\xe2\x80\x99ll eventually be gone like a certain left-handed reliever of the past who is apparently now out of baseball.Perez just turned 30 on Wednesday. And I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll be shocked to learn that he was a former first-round draft pick \xe2\x80\x93 what else would Duquette sign? It was in 2006 by the Cardinals.His best success was in 2011 and 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 All-Star seasons \xe2\x80\x93 with the Cleveland Indians where he saved a total of 75 games. However, even then his ERA was well over 3.46. Over his career, Perez has walked 3.9 batters per nine innings. To put that into perspective, Ubaldo Jimenez has only been slightly higher at 4.1.\xc2\xa0 However, Brian Matusz is at 5.3 for this season, but that\xe2\x80\x99s another story.So do the Orioles have something in Perez?\xc2\xa0 You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to bet on it. But a new life in a new place \xe2\x80\x93 a place we know to be a healthy environment \xe2\x80\x93 could make a difference both on the field and off. The risk is small. The effort is honorable.Next: Looking back at the top 7 Orioles from JunesMore from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injury ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Series Preview: Orioles vs. White Sox - Camden Chat', "" The Story So Far:  Last year when the Rangers came to Baltimore, the O's swept them in four games. Almost exactly a year later it was a different story. There are probably a lot of reasons they lost three of four- Bud Norris pitching, Mitch Moreland hitting home runs with the ease of a single, the offense struggling against average pitching, going 2 for 21 with RISP...the list goes on. Fortunately, the rest of the AL East struggled this week as well and the Orioles still find themselves in a tie for first place in the division. A series in Chicago with the White Sox may not be the easiest way they could look to get things right again, but its pretty close.    The White Sox had high hopes coming into this season but things just haven't worked out for them. They're 34-42 and 10 games behind in a tough division. What's worse is that record is actually an over-performance - their pythagorean expectation is only 30 wins. Of course, they did just beat the Cardinals in two games in St. Louis and took two of the three from the same Rangers that just beat down the O's. Baseball is weird. Pitching Matchups: Friday: Ubaldo Jimenez vs. John Danks     2015    W/L   IP   ERA+   FIP   WHIP   SO/W     Jimenez   7-3   87.1   125   3.12   1.237   3.30     Danks   3-8   80.1   70   4.88   1.481   2.50     After a few shaky outings, Jimenez went out in his last start against the Indians and dominated: 8 IP, 7Ks, 0 BBs, 0ER. You can't really ask for more. The great thing here is that not only is Jimenez pitching well, he's pitching about as well as he has his entire career. His FIP of 3.12 is very close to what it was in 2010 when he was a finalist for the Cy Young (3.10). His SO/W would be the highest he's ever had for a season if he keeps that number up. He's also giving up home runs at a lower rate than he has since his last season in Colorado. He's got a 5.79 career ERA at US Cellular Field in six starts, but most of those came when he played on the Indians and wasn't pitching very well, so maybe it doesn't mean much.    So John Danks is having a terrible season. His numbers aren't good and he's coming off four consecutive losses. They've been bad losses too - 17 earned runs in four games. He's probably not looking forward to this matchup. Danks is a lefty, and right-handers this season have an OPS against him of .932. And you know what the Orioles have? Right-handed power. J.J Hardy, Matt Wieters, and Nolan Reimold all have home runs off him in their careers.    Saturday: Chris Tillman vs. Jeff Samardzija     2015    W/L   IP   ERA+   FIP   WHIP   SO/W     Tillman   6-7   79.1   68   4.75   1.513   1.56     Samardzija   5-4   108.2   82   3.65   1.316   4.40     It must be weird to be Jeff (if you think I'm typing that last name again, you're wrong). This time last year he was regarded as a great up and coming pitcher. Oakland gave up a lot to the Cubs because they thought he'd be a solid addition to their rotation as they made their playoff run. That didn't work out, and so the A's traded him to the White Sox, who also thought he'd be a key piece they needed as they made a push to get back to the playoffs. That's not working again, and so now there's talk he could be traded AGAIN since he's coming up on free agency and the White Sox don't want to lose him for nothing. He could play for his fourth team in two years. His numbers this year aren't terrible, though he does lead the league in hits allowed with 123. He's probably also not looking forward to meeting up with the Orioles again. In two starts against them (one in Oakland last season, the other this year in that no crowd game) he's got an 8.25 ERA in 12 innings pitched. Manny Machado might be hitting better than he ever has before, so he may only improve on his 5 for 6 including two home runs record against Jeff.    OK, Tillman. Let's put it all behind us. 2015 started for you on Sunday against the Indians. You don't need to repeat your 7 IP, 6Ks, 0BBs, 0ER performance. Give me six innings, one run (or less) and more strikeouts than walks. The White Sox have some hitters in their lineup, but this still a bad team. You can do it. Sunday: Miguel Gonzalez vs. Chris Sale     2015    W/L   IP   ERA+   FIP   WHIP   SO/W     Gonzalez   6-5   82.1   96   5.06   1.227   2.37     Sale   6-4   103.1   130   2.09   0.968   6.41     Something not good is happening with Gonzalez's season and I don't like it. In his first eight starts this season, he was 5-2 with a 3.24 ERA with 42 strikeouts. Since then he's 1-3 with a 5.29 ERA and only 22 strikeouts. He's also had two games in his last four where he's given up three home runs. He's never pitched in the south side of Chicago, but has two starts against the White Sox, one in each of the last two seasons. 2013's start was good, 2014's wasn't. Hopefully he can at least do enough to keep the O's in it, because the offense may struggle in this game...    Chris Sale might be the best pitcher in baseball right now. Since his last start against the O's in Baltimore (where he was dominant with 12 Ks in 7.2 innings), he's only gotten better. In his last six starts, he's got 75 strikeouts while only giving up eight walks and two home runs. The O's actually played pretty well against him last year, so maybe they have a chance in this one. Adam Jones is probably your best bet - he's 4 for 11 including a home run off Sale. Other Notes: - The White Sox have been much better at home this season - their winning percentage there is .545. The O's meanwhile have a road winning percentage of .432. - The White Sox don't have a great lineup, but there are some dangerous spots in there, with Jose Abreu, Adam LaRoche, and Melky Cabrera. - The White Sox have the 26th ranked bullpen by ERA in MLB, so the Orioles would do well to chase the starters early. Of course, the Rangers bullpen is ranked 28th and didn't seem to matter much. The problem in that series though was the O's lineup couldn't put any pressure on the Rangers starters in order to get to the bullpen. They may struggle with Sale, but they have a good chance of doing that against Danks and Jeff. - Two of these games have early afternoon start times, and in those games (anything that started before 4pm) the O's are 14-8 this season.    Prediction: I hope my whiff on predicting the Rangers series isn't a sign my jinxing ways are back. If they weren't facing Chris Sale, I'd like the Orioles to get the sweep. But he's been pitching really well lately and a win doesn't seem likely. Still, I like them to get two out of three. June was a great month for this team and came after a terrible May. The calendar's flipped to July and they're in first place. The All-Star break is coming up soon, and then it'll be time to make a run to securing the title again. For now though - two out of three to start this road trip would be a good first step.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
07/04/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Who Stole the Offense?', 'Jun 15, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles catcher Matt Wieters (32) celebrates with left fielder Nolan Reimold (14) after hitting a three run home run in the sixth inning against the Philadelphia Phillies at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsSo what has become of the Baltimore Orioles offense, having been shut down two consecutive days with zero runs and only seven opportunities with runners in scoring position? After a month of June where they outscored opponents 148-102, with a 5.29-runs per game average, one would not expect the spigot to turn off so suddenly.I truly think the answer is primarily one thing about all others combined: they have simply run into some pretty good pitching \xe2\x80\x93 both starters and bullpen. It has also seemed that an unusual percentage of those balls that have been fairly well \xe2\x80\x9csquared up\xe2\x80\x9d have been hit hard right at someone.Along the way, the Orioles have had good pitching, only allowing three runs. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have the pitching stay consistent than the hitting, but nothing beats both working together. Easier said than done.But all to say: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the Orioles are falling into some sort of team hitting slump. On quite a few swings and fly balls even last night, there was the look that they just missed on catching it square.

But the question is asking beyond that time, who is the next to be designated like Delmon Young?As always, there is the regular possibility that at any moment, an injury could change the entire landscape. But apart from that, it would seem that an outfielder has to go in order to bring Jonathan Schoop aboard. I can\xe2\x80\x99t see the Orioles leaving the presumptive long-term second baseman in the minor leagues, especially if he is hitting there, which he is.Jimmy Paredes has performed far too well to lose, even if they still need to somehow find a position for him. Chris Parmelee is not only a solid player thus far this year, he is a future piece in the probable loss of Chris Davis. Travis Snider has another year under team control, and though he does not look awesome, his production numbers are at least decent.So it really comes down to Reimold or David Lough. The Orioles really do have a plethora of left-handed hitters in the aforementioned names, along with using Chris Davis often now in right field. Remember too that Ryan Flaherty can play corner outfield. With Young gone, Reimold looks to be more necessary to retain.It has always been presumed that Lough\xe2\x80\x99s ticket to remain on the roster is that he serves as the backup for Adam Jones. Up until the past couple weeks, a Jones backup player could easily be forgotten or overlooked. Adam plays all the time \xe2\x80\xa6 until recently. His style of play makes him a bit more vulnerable to some besetting injuries as he ages.So the question comes down to whether or not it is deemed that Nolan Reimold is an adequate replacement in center field. I think the answer is \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d and that, at some point in the next week, the Orioles will have to reluctantly bid a likely farewell to Lough.Lough is only hitting .216, and though considered a fast runner, he has been thrown out in 4-of-5 base stealing attempts. He\xe2\x80\x99s a good guy and a good athlete, but I think the numbers simply catch up to him. These are problems that long-term winning organizations face. We\xe2\x80\x99re just not used to that in Baltimore.Next: Baltimore has become a place of starting over again for numerous players ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles finally score still lose to White Sox 3-2 - USA TODAY', 'Baltimore Orioles starter Chris Tillman delivers a pitch during the first inning of a baseball game against the Chicago White Sox Saturday, July 4, 2015, in Chicago.

Shuck doubled to right field off Darren O\'Day.David Robertson earned his 18th save in 22 opportunities \xe2\x80\x94 with a huge assist from Garcia.

Machado connected against Zach Putnam (2-3), who replaced Jeff Samardzija after he walked the previous batter.The home run ended Baltimore\'s scoreless streak at 26 2-3 innings.""They\'ve got a good staff over there, and they\'re doing what they\'ve got to do,"" Machado said. ""So, we\'ve got to clean our stuff up and go out there tomorrow and start swinging.""Samardzija struck out nine and allowed a run and three hits in 7 2-3 innings.

In general, solo home runs aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to kill you \xe2\x80\x93 unless you let them, that is. They can often feel similar to death by a paper cut in a way. But in general, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to find yourself in trouble in games if you can\xe2\x80\x99t overcome solo shots.In Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s case, he pitched a great game that was well worthy of earning a victory against the ChiSox. Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7 IP, 6 H, 1 R, 2 BB, 4 K. Catcher Caleb Joseph said after the game that Jimenez didn\xe2\x80\x99t have his really good stuff. While a catcher would know better than a writer, in my personal opinion I would respectfully disagree. However needless to say, Jimenez put the Orioles in a position to win the game \xe2\x80\x93 and then some. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you ask of your starter.

The Baltimore WireThe Orioles were never really able to get a rally going, although each time they tried they were somehow foiled. Part of it for sure was that they managed to run into some pretty decent pitching once again in the form of John Danks. However you do have to take advantage of situations when they come about; the Birds had two runners on in the fifth, and Steve Pearce grounded into a double-play to kill the rally temporarily. The O\xe2\x80\x99s still had a runner at third with two outs when Caleb Joseph walked to cover the corners, but Ryan Flaherty grounded out to end the inninng.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 best chance to score was perhaps in the top of the seventh when they had two runners on with one out. With Joseph at the plate, Danks unloaded a wild pitch and suddenly the O\xe2\x80\x99s had two runners inCourtesy of Matt Marton-USA TODAY Sportsscoring position. A base hit would have probably given the Birds the lead, however Joseph struck out and Flaherty flied out to end the threat and the inning.None of that takes away however from how impressive Jimenez was. The few times he found himself in trouble he pitched out of it. It was Jose Abreu of course who hit the solo home run in the last of the third which sunk the Birds on this night. Jimenez left the pitch up and Abreu jumped on it, however he also hit the ball the opposite way. That speaks more to the strength of Abreu than the poor location of the pitch, as in general a player isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be able to hit that out the other way.Jimenez did show signs of coming undone in the immediate aftermath of that homer. He took the next hitter (Melky Cabrera) to 3-1, before battling back and striking him out. Following an Adam LaRoche ground out, Jimenez and the Orioles got some help in the form of incredibly poor base running by Chicago. Avisail Garcia hit a soft fly ball to right center, for which Chris Davis (in right field once again) made a diving attempt. The ball deflected off of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 glove, and was thrown back into the infield by second baseman Ryan Flaherty. Garcia never had any prayer of being safe at second base, yet he continued on anyways; and J.J.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsWith a completed first half-season of baseball (81 games) in the books for 2014, Jonathan Schoop returned to the Baltimore Orioles on Sunday in Chicago to incite a turnaround from their three-game losing streak. The offense \xe2\x80\x93 so powerful throughout June \xe2\x80\x93 had seemed to disappear in July. But it returned in good form on Sunday in a strong 9-1 drubbing of the White Sox.A critical early hit was the second inning home run of Schoop \xe2\x80\x93 a no-doubter deep into the left field stands to give the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 2-0 lead at the time. And his arm on defense was displayed in a relay throw to nail a runner attempting to stretch a double. Together, it was a reminder of the resident skills in the big second baseman.

Among them \xe2\x80\xa6Taking advantage of mistakes and opportunities \xe2\x80\x93 In the recent string of losing games, the Orioles have not accrued any benefit from the few chances presented to them to score a few runs. They were 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position in the first two games. But on Sunday they jumped on the Sox and their four errors to break the game open.Adam Jones \xe2\x80\x93 Without doubt, Jones has not been himself after some nagging injuries over the past couple of weeks have affected his game. He was 5-for-36 coming in, but he had two doubles on the day, the first scoring the opening run of the game in inning one.Caleb Joseph \xe2\x80\x93 Also struggling at the plate has been the O\xe2\x80\x99s every-other-day catcher. Joseph had perhaps the biggest hit of the game with a double on a nine-pitch at-bat to drive in the third and fourth runs.Steve Pearce \xe2\x80\x93 The first half of the season has not been what Pearce had in mind for 2015. He came in batting .219. But on this day he collected three hits and made a great defensive play.Miguel Gonzalez \xe2\x80\x93 Sunday saw the Miggy that O\xe2\x80\x99s fans are used to seeing. It was a very good game after three non-characteristic starts that have been quite difficult and sub-par. Gonzalez was great in the second half last year, and hopefully this can be the beginning of the same for this campaign.The Orioles have six games upcoming in the week ahead: three in Minnesota and three at home against the Nationals. If they could win four of the six games, it would put them at 47-41 at the All-Star break. That is not awesome, but it is better than we could have hoped for even a month ago.

The four Orioles are Adam Jones, Manny Machado, Zach Britton and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day.Jones is one of three backup outfielders on the roster, joining Jose Bautista and J.D. Martinez, behind starters Mike Trout, Lorenzo Cain and Alex Gordon. The Final Vote for the AL also features two outfielders, Yoenis Cespedes and Brett Gardner.It\xe2\x80\x99s a crowded outfield that Jones is going to try and break into, but I believe that he is the second best outfielder on the team, only behind Trout, and that he is more than deserving of significant playing time in the game.The only thing that might hurt him is the nagging injuries that have plagued him throughout the year.For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, in the fan voting, Jones finished seventh amongst outfielders, behind the three starters, Bautista, Cespedes, and Alex Rios. jQuery( document ).ready( function() {if ( typeof otsembed !== \'undefined\' ) {otsembed.embed( {target: ""otsvideo135071322"",segment: ""135071322"",showHeader: false } );}} ); Machado is the only third baseman on the reserve roster, though he could be joined by Mike Moustakas, via the Final Vote.Machado currently sits at eighth in the majors, fourth in the AL, in WAR. Machado also finds himself in the top ten in the AL for hits, home runs, runs, slugging percentage, and stolen bases.Machado is one of the best young players in baseball, but so is starter Josh Donaldson, who is more than deserving of his starting spot. Machado should see a little time in this one, but expect to see plenty of Donaldson, who only received the most All-Star votes any player has ever received.As for Britton and O\xe2\x80\x99Day, they join a stacked pitching staff that Ned Yost is going to have a lot of fun managing for the night.Considering the Orioles have no starters, four All-Stars is an impressive number, and all four guys have put together legitimate All-Star seasons. jQuery( document ).ready( function() {if ( typeof otsembed !== \'undefined\' ) {otsembed.embed( {target: ""otsvideo135071324"",segment: ""135071324"",showHeader: false } );}} ); Baltimore has been heating up over the past month or so, and they\xe2\x80\x99re starting to show why they have been in playoff contention for the past few years.

We are halfway through the season. This exercise always surfaces some pleasant surprises and some shocking negatives.In the pleasant surprise category is the combined batting average of all Orioles right fielders at .291 and second in the league, even as their combined RBI totals are near the bottom.In the shocking category is seeing the combined batting average of all O\xe2\x80\x99s left fielders at 12th in the league at .221.\xc2\xa0 Ugh!\xc2\xa0 I guess that is not terribly surprising given the early season troubles of Alejandro De Aza, and nobody else has claimed that position on a daily basis.And in the category of \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid that might be true,\xe2\x80\x9d it is grievous to see the combined second base batting average as 10th in the league at .241.\xc2\xa0 But it is true that the power numbers in home runs and RBIs are among the best in the A.L.Here is a chart of the Orioles hitters, position by position, and how they rank in the American League. After the graph we\xe2\x80\x99ll make a few comments on each position.PositionAverageHRsRBIsCatcher.237 (6)8 (10)35 (7)1st Base.243 (9)19 (4)51 (5)2nd Base.241 (10)8 (5)39 (4)3rd Base.299 (2)17 (3)47 (2)Shortstop.226 (12)6 (3)28 (6)Left Field.221 (12)8 (7)25 (13)Center Field.274 (8)12 (2)44 (3)Right Field.291 (2)10 (11)37 (9)D.

Even though Wieters has obviously better production numbers (though that has cooled off in recent games), Joseph does have a very good on-base percentage of .317 for a player that is only batting .239.\xc2\xa0 He does however strike out in about 25% of plate appearances.

A surprise here is to see that Steve Pearce is batting .317 when playing first base \xe2\x80\x93 16-for-51 with three doubles and three homers. Does his position defensively affect him greatly on offense?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a reporter here, but his batting average apart from playing first base is .194.2nd Base \xe2\x80\x93 It has been a long, long time since the Orioles had much of a batting average contribution from the second base position, and this continues to be a reality. However, they get above-average power from the likes of Ryan Flaherty and Jonathan Schoop. Exactly one-half of the at-bats are from Flaherty, who has hit .254 when playing second.3rd Base \xe2\x80\x93 Obviously, and not surprisingly, Manny Machado has this position\xe2\x80\x99s numbers near the top of the American League. It has been a great year and a pleasure to see him achieving at the very high level of the hopes everyone has had for him. The impressive item in this number is to see his RBIs total of 47 as second in the league \xe2\x80\x93 most of this from the leadoff position (34 total).Shortstop \xe2\x80\x93 Though we would not expect J.J. Hardy and the other O\xe2\x80\x99s who have played shortstop to have these stats in the top third of the league, neither would we expect them to only be better than three other teams. Everth Cabrera\xe2\x80\x99s 19-for-91 (.209) really pulls the numbers down. Also giving some better feeling to these stats is the way that Hardy has a special gift for delivering in clutch situations \xe2\x80\x93 bang for the buck.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoLeft Field \xe2\x80\x93 There is not much in the way of any sort of excellence that stands out among the seven players who have been in left field for the Baltimore Orioles.

The best overall numbers are surprisingly from David Lough \xe2\x80\x93 13-for-48 with a .271 average.Center Field \xe2\x80\x93 Adam Jones helps these numbers to be near the top, especially in terms of power \xe2\x80\x93 second in home runs and third in RBIs.\xc2\xa0 But it is surprising to see the .274 batting average as only in the middle of the pack. There are some very good A.L. center fielders.Right Field \xe2\x80\x93 As mentioned above, the .291 average is surprising and certainly a good statistic. This is about Markakis-like numbers, while the 10 homers are above what he would have provided.

Machado is arguably one of the best players in baseball right now. He hits for average and power, steals bases and is a Platinum Glove winner. Jones will be making his fourth consecutive All-Star appearance and also one of the best at his position. Britton has saved 23 games in 2015, good for second-best in the AL, and 60 saves since taking over the closer role last May.But Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day?! That shocked everyone. Well, everyone who does not follow the Orioles and the game of baseball. O\xe2\x80\x99Day has been the unsung, late-inning firearm for Buck Showalter in his four years in Baltimore who is finally getting the glory he deserves.Britton gets a lot of the credit for the Orioles because he earns the statistic for an earned save in most of his work. The 23 saves, 1.82 ERA and 1.01 WHIP are phenomenal numbers for Britton, and certainly All-Star worthy. They just do not compete with what O\xe2\x80\x99Day has done for the Orioles.O\xe2\x80\x99Day has given up just four runs and has struck out 43 batters in 32.2 innings of work, while issuing just eight walks for a WHIP of .0796 and a 1.10 ERA. Opponents are hitting just .151 against the 32-year-old who is 5-0 on the season and has a couple of saves to his credit as well.The numbers are even more astonishing over the course of his tenure with the Birds. The submarine pitcher has compiled a 22-6 record while striking out 244 batters, and is sporting a ridiculous .092 WHIP and 1.91 ERA in 230.1 innings of work since being claimed off waivers from the Rangers in 2011. He could be the best setup man in baseball.If O\xe2\x80\x99Day is not the best setup man in baseball, Kansas City Royals manager Ned Yost knows two damn good ones pretty well. It is not often that non-closer relief pitchers get recognition, but Yost has three of the best in baseball at his disposal in O\xe2\x80\x99Day and fellow Royals Wade Davis and Kelvin Herrera. Davis was selected by the players, while Herrera and O\xe2\x80\x99Day were manager\xe2\x80\x99s decisions. That is a great deal of respect from a manager that is supposedly going for the win to secure home field advantage in the World Series.The 2015 MLB All-Star Game will be played exactly a week from today at the Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati on Tuesday, July 14.For the casual baseball fan that will tune in to watch the All-Star Game, once they see his side-arm delivery used to perfection, they are sure to remember who Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day is.

In a similar article yesterday we detailed how the O\xe2\x80\x99s ranked position by position around the league.Overall, the pitching is going to rank just a bit better than did the hitting. With most of the offensive stats averaging out at the end of analyses as about league average, the pitching stats will be mostly just slightly above the norm, particularly on the strength of the bullpen.To lay out some raw numbers, here they are (with A.L. ranking) in three categories: for the overall staff, for the starters, and finally for the bullpen. The five categories for this general overview are: earned run average, batting average against, walks/hits per innings pitched, home runs allowed. We\xe2\x80\x99ll give some other statistical rankings in the remarks below the graph.ERABAA WHIPK/BBHRsTotal3.68 (6).245 (6)1.26 (7)2.56 (9)88 (3)Starters4.12 (9).256 (6)1.30 (8)2.42 (11)65 (1)Bullpen 2.86 (3).224 (4)1.18 (4)2.78 (4)23 (10)\xc2\xa0It is immediately clear from these numbers that the bullpen has had overall better success than the starting pitchers. And this is after the pen had a terribly horrific month of April that placed them #14 overall in the American League.The Baltimore starters have not been terrible, but our simple memories of the season \xe2\x80\x93 totally apart from statistics \xe2\x80\x93 would tell us that this has been a very up and down situation.The overall batting average against is really not bad at all \xe2\x80\x93 starters and relievers. The problem however has been in the area of allowing too many walks. All totaled, the Orioles have given up the third-most free passes in the American League with a total of 246. The starters have yielded the fourth-most, and even the bullpen has allowed the sixth-most bases on balls.And the strikeout numbers for the O\xe2\x80\x99s are not exceptional, especially for the starters who are 11th in the league. The bullpen, however, ranks third; this gives a total ranking at the center of the league in the #8 position.Another strong statistic for the bullpen is the conversion of save opportunities. As a team they are 26-of-31 for an 83.87% ratio \xe2\x80\x93 ranking #2 in the A.L. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryWe all know how rare complete games are in the modern game. The Baltimore Orioles are one of only two teams that is yet to have a complete game. Oddly enough the other is the Tampa Bay Rays, who are the #2 overall team in ERA at 3.12.For the Orioles to have success over the second half of the season, the starters are going to need to pick up the pace and have a campaign like the summer and fall of 2014. The bullpen needs to also remain consistent. And beyond this, the offense has to be able to hit with better consistency, even against the best pitching that is thrown at them.The Orioles are healthier now, and the talent is certainly in the clubhouse to repeat and make a legitimate run through the playoffs. It is a matter of living up to that talent and making it happen on the field. They are at this moment a statistically slightly better than average team, so it is no surprise that they enter this evening\xe2\x80\x99s game with a record of 43-40. They can be better than this; I believe them to be better than this.Next: Ranking the O's in the A.L. position by positionMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Why the Baltimore Orioles minor league teams are worth ...', ' I have long been of the opinion that minor league baseball could very well be the best value in all of professional sports. If provides the opportunity to watch high-quality action at a fraction of the cost of an MLB game.    The Orioles make it even more attractive to their fans by having four of their top five affiliates within the state of Maryland, and the fifth, Triple-A Norfolk, is just a four-hour drive from Baltimore. Not a lot of teams have such easy access. For example, the New York Mets Triple-A affiliate is located in Las Vegas. That\'s a five-hour plane ride away. O\'s fans have it made. The rosters of these teams make up, or least we hope they do, the future of the Baltimore Orioles. That 19-year-old you seen in Aberdeen today could be an everyday starter at Camden Yards in a few years. So I thought it would be fun to take a quick digital trip around to all of the Orioles affiliates, minus the ""Rookie"" level since you cannot attend those games, and tell you what you can expect to see there the rest of the season. Maybe it will persuade you to give it a chance one night. Sound good? Good!    Norfolk Tides AAA Affiliate, International LeagueNorfolk, VirginiaHarbor Park237 miles from Oriole Park at Camden Yards    If you want the team where you are going to recognize the most names every time you go to a game, the Tides are the team to check out. Some notable guys who have spent most of 2015 with Norfolk: Steve Clevenger, Christian Walker, Henry Urrutia, Dariel Alvarez and Eddie Gamboa. And that is just for your Tides. A lot of other organizations have some Major League level talent down at Triple-A too. Harbor Park is huge for a minor league stadium. It holds about 12,000 people and has much more of a big league stadium look than all of the other O\'s affiliates. Admittedly, this is the one O\'s minor league stadium that I have not had a chance to visit yet.    Like I said, Minor League baseball is a great bargain. For the Tides, $12 will buy you the best seats in the house. Really, that will buy you any ticket in the house. That includes the promotions and giveaways that you have with pretty much every game. A quick list of cool promotions the rest of the season:-Youth Tides Jersey (July 10)-Fireworks (July 11, Aug. 8, Sept. 3, Sept. 4)-Turn back the clock, including $0.50 concessions (Aug. 3)-Spongebob Night, Tides wear Spongebob-themed jerseys (Aug. 7) Bowie Baysox AA Affiliate, Eastern LeagueBowie, MarylandPrince George\'s Stadium28 miles from Oriole Park at Camden Yards    The Baysox are currently the best team in the Eastern League. That is reason enough to check them out. They sit at 47-35, and it\'s because of the solid core of talent they have right now, including inevitable September call-up Mychal Givens, who has pitched to a 1.72 ERA and 13 saves for the Sox. Other names of note on the roster are Tim Berry, who is struggling, Brandon Snyder, Glynn Davis, Matt Hobgood, Mike Yastrzemski, Branden Kline and 23-year old Trey Mancini, who is slashing .358/.392/.600 for Bowie over 25 games. Prince George\'s Stadium is exactly what comes to mind when one thinks of a minor league stadium. The outfield walls are emblazoned with advertisements galore. The video board is a bit faulty, but still easy enough to see. It\'s cheesy, but not over the top. Officially, the park holds 10,000 people, which makes it the biggest minor league stadium in Maryland, for whatever that is worth. The most expensive tickets are $17, so it is a bit pricier but still worth it. And the Baysox also have a lengthy list of promotions: -Fireworks (every Friday and Saturday home game)-Babe Ruth Bobblehead (July 19)-Back hair appreciation night (July 30)-""Captain Manny"" Machado Bobblehead night (Aug. 9)-General Admission for $1 (Aug. 20) Frederick Keys High-A Affiliate, Carolina LeagueFrederick, MarylandNymeo Field at Harry Groves Stadium48 miles from Oriole Park at Camden Yards    Wei-Yin Chen made a brief appearance here earlier this season, but the main attraction now is 20-year-old catching prospect Chance Sisco, who is slashing .287/.370/.375 thus far. Other players to keep an eye on are shortstop Adrian Marin and outfielder Josh Hart. Nymeo is a credit union, and it purchased the naming rights to Harry Grove Stadium this past off-season. The park, abbreviated HGS, holds 5,400 patrons and tickets range from $9-12, so it\'s a heck of a bargain. HGS was built back in 1990, and has a similar look to Prince George\'s in that it has tons of advertisements beyond the outfield walls. Let\'s check out their notable promotions:-Fireworks (every Friday and Saturday home game)-Parks and Recreation night, all about the NBC show (July 20)-Guaranteed win night, IF the Keys lose, you get to go to another game for free (every Tuesday home game)-Zach Britton Bobblehead (July 25)-90s Nickelodeon night (July 31)-Seinfeld Soup Nazi night (Aug. 15)-Kevin Gausman Bobblehead (Aug. 22) Delmarva Shorebirds Low-A Affiliate, South Atlantic LeagueSalisbury, MarylandArthur W. Perdue Stadium118 miles from Oriole Park at Camden Yards The Shorebirds may be the easiest team to incorporate into your family\'s annual vacation plans if you live in the Baltimore area. Perdue Stadium is about 30 or 40 minutes away from all of Ocean City\'s attractions. It\'s not even that much of a detour.    Currently, the roster doesn\'t boast a ton of star power, with only Sebastian Vader and Reyes jumping off the page. However, the beauty is that the Orioles most recent draft picks just started playing professional baseball at Aberdeen and Gulf Coast a few weeks ago. Don\'t be surprised if first-round pick D.J. Stewart is wearing a Shorebirds uniform before the end of the 2015 season. It\'s all about chicken on the Eastern Shore. OK, it\'s really not, but Perdue is an important business out there. They sponsor Salisbury University and the Shorebirds. That\'s power. The stadium itself holds a little over 5,000 people and is set to undergo a\xc2\xa0major renovation following the season, including a new video board, which is something it has sorely needed for a while. The Shorebirds will also get a new playing surface as the grass has gotten noticeably beaten up over the years. For the fans, the concessions will be revamped to reflect a ""boardwalk"" theme. It all sounds pretty darn cool if I do say so myself. Tickets for a Shorebirds game top out at $11 if you are looking to sit right down on the field level. But as always, there is a slew of promotions: -Fireworks (every Saturday home game)-Christmas in July (July 18)-Manny Machado 2011 All-Star Bobblehead (Aug. 14)-Float for the Fund, unlimited root beer floats for $5 (Aug. 16) Aberdeen IronBirds Short-season-A Affiliate,Aberdeen, MarylandLeidos Field at Ripken Stadium35 miles away from Oriole Park at Camden Yards    If you are a fan of minor league baseball and the atmosphere, the IronBirds are definitely one to check out. The newly-minted Leidos Field at Ripken Stadium is one of the nicest minor league parks you will find. Not to mention all of the cool little league fields just beyond the first-base side of the stadium, including a scaled down version of Camden Yards, including the warehouse. On the field, the team looks to be much better than last year, when they lost nearly twice as many games as they won. The attention grabber is D.J. Stewart, the O\'s top pick in June\'s draft. However, fellow draft classmate first baseman Steve Laurino is putting up the numbers early (.328 BA, 6 2B, 1 HR, 8 RBI in 17 games). Meanwhile, outfielder Cedric Mullins, another 2015 draftee, has also been solid (.324 BA with four stolen bases). The IronBirds pitchers to watch are all southpaws: Travis Seabrooke, Tanner Scott and Lazaro Leyva. All three have good stuff, but Leyva has touched 99 mph this year. At Ripken Stadium, you pay for the amenities. It\'s $26.50 for a club box seat and $17 for a seat behind home plate. However, they too have some cool giveaways and promotions. -Fireworks (every Friday and Saturday home game)-Dylan Bundy T-Shirt night (July 8)-Cal Ripken Jr. 1983 World Series Bobblehead (July 15)-Back to the Future night, Doc Brown T-Shirt giveaway (July 16)-Christmas in July, Ugly Sweater T-Shirt giveaway (July 25)-Cal Ripken ""Season for the ages"" Bobblehead giveaway (Aug. 5)-Jackie Robinson #42 T-Shirt giveaway (Aug. 22)-2131 Bobblehead giveaway (Sept. 2)    That\'s everything. Just a note, I did not include EVERY giveaway for each team, just the ones that I thought personally were cool. For a full list, visit each team\'s website. But anyway, I hope I convinced you to at least give minor league baseball a chance. It\'s a fun and affordable time, especially if you have kids.

Whatever the route, Brian Dozier figures to again be a focal point Tuesday night when the Twins try for their first consecutive wins in nearly three weeks. Torii Hunter and Aaron Hicks each hit homers Monday, and Dozier delivered the walk-off two-run shot as Minnesota (44-39) defeated Baltimore 4-2 in 10 innings. The Twins have five home runs in their last three games, accounting for seven of their 11 total runs. In his last four at home, Dozier has six RBIs and a 1.039 OPS. He leads the AL with 46 extra-base hits and his 17 home runs are the most among second basemen. Those numbers were not enough to include him in the AL\xe2\x80\x99s initial All-Star game roster, although Dozier could still be added courtesy of the Final Vote. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been the best second baseman in baseball for the last year and a half,\xe2\x80\x9d closer Glen Perkins told MLB\xe2\x80\x99s official website. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an All-Star player.\xe2\x80\x9d Dozier\xe2\x80\x99s powerful display could be difficult to replicate against Gausman (1-0, 3.09 ERA), who has not allowed a home run in his last 17 1-3 innings \xe2\x80\x93 a streak that dates back to April 19. The right-hander impressed in his second start of the season, tossing 6 1-3 shutout innings and matching a career high with seven strikeouts in a 2-0 loss to Texas on Thursday. He has similarly excelled in his last four relief appearances, tallying six scoreless innings before landing on the DL May 8 with right shoulder tendinitis. Gausman has a 2.04 ERA over six starts dating back to Sept. 6, and following his most recent performance, manager Buck Showalter opted to keep the 24-year-old in the rotation and move Bud Norris to the bullpen. \xe2\x80\x9cWe like Kevin and we think he\xe2\x80\x99s a guy on a given night that gives us a good chance to win,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs evidenced by his last outing and a lot of outings, he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing it for a while. Obviously, we are all about this year and today\xe2\x80\x99s game and tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s game, but you are thinking down the road, too.\xe2\x80\x9d He shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t count on much run support from his teammates, with the Orioles totaling 24 runs \xe2\x80\x93 nine coming in one game \xe2\x80\x93 during a 2-6 stretch. Baltimore (43-40) is 6 for 53 (.113) with runners in scoring position in that eight-game span after going hitless in eight opportunities Monday. Monday\xe2\x80\x99s victory was the third straight at home for Minnesota, which has won\xe2\x80\x99t won two in a row overall since a three-game run June 17-19. Kyle Gibson (6-6, 3.04) looks to continue a string of solid outings for the Twins. The right-hander tossed four-hit ball over eight innings and struck out seven in a 2-0 win at Kansas City on Thursday. It was the second straight win for Gibson, who has a 2.45 ERA in his past four starts. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s had a couple really good starts after a couple that were less in terms of command and things like that,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Paul Molitor said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99s developed a really good mentality about how he goes out there and the way he wants to perform to give our team a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Mauer is 17 for 40 (.425) with 12 RBIs in his last 11 games against the Orioles.

It took a rare stumble when Bud Norris faced the Minnesota Twins on Wednesday.Norris gave up three runs \xe2\x80\x94 including two homers \xe2\x80\x94 in the sixth inning, Chaz Roe allowed two more runs in the seventh and the Twins completed a three-game sweep with a 5-3 win over the Orioles.Manny Machado and Chris Davis hit back-to-back homers for Baltimore in the eighth inning, but Glen Perkins pitched a perfect ninth for the Twins for his 28th save in 28 attempts. The Orioles, who have lost six of their last seven games, combined for 10 runs in the six losses.""We\'re just not giving our pitchers much margin for error,"" Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said.Leading 1-0 in the sixth, Norris (2-9) walked Eric Fryer with one out, and Brian Dozier went deep for the team-leading 18th time this year to put the Twins in front. Joe Mauer followed with a full-count home run to left-center for a 3-1 lead.""Dozier\'s been swinging a real hot bat,"" Norris said. ""I still had two strikes in the count and I thought I had him the pitch before, but, unfortunately, he punished a mistake that I made. With Mauer, I left a 3-2 slider that he put a really good swing on.""From April 29 through Tuesday, the Orioles had the best relief ERA in the majors at 2.25.After going 15-8 with a 3.65 ERA in 28 starts last season, Norris was 2-7 with a 6.79 ERA in 11 starts this year before being sent to the bullpen last week. He also missed nearly a month with bronchitis.""I\'m just trying to get comfortable. It\'s going to be an adjustment period and I just want to do my part,"" Norris said. ""I feel bad about today. I don\'t want to let my team down. It\'s kind of tough to swallow.""Showalter said he thought Norris pitched well in his lone previous relief appearance Saturday, taking the loss after allowing an earned run in 2 2-3 innings at the Chicago White Sox.That\'s little consolation to Norris.""They\'ve all been frustrating as of late,"" he said.Minnesota starter Tommy Milone (5-1) stayed unbeaten in seven starts since being brought back from Triple-A Rochester at the beginning of June, striking out five in seven innings to lower his ERA to 2.84.Orioles starter Ubaldo Jimenez pitched five scoreless innings, but he needed a season-high 110 pitches to finish them.The Twins went 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position against Jimenez, who gave up seven hits and three walks while striking out five. Eddie Rosario ended innings in all three of his at-bats against the right-hander, striking out with the bases loaded, popping up with men at second and third and grounding out with runners at the corners.""It was very hard, but I got out of it. At the same time I got really tired,"" said Jimenez, who has allowed one run in 20 innings over his last three starts.TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles 1B Christian Walker, who was the DH, was recalled before the game from Triple-A Norfolk to take the roster spot of RHP Kevin Gausman, who went down for one start to keep the All-Star break from throwing him off schedule.

So they forced Gausman to throw the ball over the plate and to use his fastball; and when you can\xe2\x80\x99t mix a change up or breaking ball in there, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking for trouble.Mauer singled again in the last of the third, and strangely enough went to second on another Gausman wild pitch. After moving up on a groundout, he managed to score to give Minnesota a 4-0 lead on a passed ball by Matt Wieters. Unlike the first inning however, Gausman pitched out of the third. However if not for some unforeseen incident, none of those four runs would have scored \xe2\x80\x93 in theory. And again, you have to credit Minnesota for taking advantage of the breaks they were given. The Orioles aren\xe2\x80\x99t always able to do that, and on occasion they end up letting teams off the hook in a sense.Brian Dozier would add a sac fly-RBI in the fourth, and Gausman would exit after loading the bases by hitting Trevor Plouffe. That brought Sano back to the plate, and he took a walk from Brad Brach to run the score to 6-0. Rosario would add a two-RBI single to make it 8-0, however the Orioles got out of the inning by throwing out Sano trying to advance to third base.The only good news of the night for the Birds was that they did attempt to battle back just a bit. Travis Snider led off the fifth with a single, and he would later score on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s two-run homer. Going forward to the eighth, Minnesota once again caught a break. The line score says that Adam Jones tacked on an RBI-double to make it 8-3 \xe2\x80\x93 which was the final. However Jones sent a deep shot to center field, which probably would have been a homer in most parks. However the pitcher-friendly AL Central parks don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to take a liking to teams like the Orioles and their homer parade act; Jones\xe2\x80\x99 shot ticked off of the top of the wall and was ruled a double.This is not to say that the extra run would have meant anything, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would have. But momentum does matter, and a home run always adds momentum. However the fact is that the Orioles swing for the fences each at-bat. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily a problem, as that\xe2\x80\x99s the culture in which they play in the AL East. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always work in a park like Target Field or even US Cellular Field, where small ball is valued more.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

First baseman Christian Walker is expected to get the call-up today to join the Orioles, which is interesting to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fan of Gausman riding the Norfolk shuttle back and forth, however in this case I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it as a problem. The O\xe2\x80\x99s appear to now be committed to keeping him in the rotation so far as I can see, and even with games like last night\xe2\x80\x99s that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. But his turn in the rotation wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come up again before the all-star break. So this gives the Birds an extra bench player, and it gives Gausman the opportunity to make a start at triple-A during the break \xe2\x80\x93 in effect it keeps him throwing.The Orioles are also expected to make a roster move in the bullpen prior to this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game, and who that involves is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess. Wesley Wright needs to come off the 60-day DL, so he\xe2\x80\x99s my prediction. Time will tell. The Orioles will try to salvage a game in Minnesota in the series finale this afternoon.

07/10/2015,"[('Orioles vs. Nationals: Series preview and a history of the ...', "" The Story So Far: There's no two ways around this - the Orioles have been playing bad baseball lately. They've lost eight of their last ten and have fallen back behind the Yankees again, tied for 2nd in the division with the Blue Jays at 2.5 games behind. The offense seems to have reverted back to an inability to score runs again, so much so so that even some decent pitching performances from arguably the team's weakest part (the starting rotation) hasn't been enough to help them win. Losing series to the Rangers, White Sox, and Twins is not what playoff teams do. At 43-42, they still have a good shot to finish before the break at or above .500, which isn't terrible but not where this team wanted to be.    The Nationals have been up and down all season. Currently they're 46-38, which isn't a bad record but probably not where they want to be either. I wonder if Bryce Harper is still wondering where his ring is. And of course, the Nationals play in what might be the league's worst division, so a three game lead is probably nothing to brag about. Harper, by the way, is having a great season, MVP-caliber even. But his .377 BABIP and 21.7% HR/FB rate are very high. I wouldn't expect him to continue that through the rest of the season. Rather than get into pitching matchups and notes about each game, I thought I'd change things up a bit and write about the history of this series. After all, I think it's turned into a pretty good rivalry. Not only is there the whole MASN thing that has kind of forced fans of both teams to take a side, but they've followed a pretty similar path since the Nationals moved to DC in 2005. At the time, the Orioles were a bad team and the Nationals weren't any better. Both teams had losing seasons until 2012, when they both made the playoffs - the Nationals won their division, the Orioles getting the wild card. In 2013, both teams missed the playoffs despite very similar winning records. Then in 2014, both teams won their divisions. The Nationals had very high World Series aspirations. I don't know about the rest of you, but while I thought the Orioles very well could win the Series last year, I was mostly happy to see them get the division crown and win a series in the playoffs. Of course, that's more than the Nationals could do, who lost in the NLDS to the Giants. The two teams didn't play each other until 2006, when there were two three game series, like this year. They would split those games, with each team winning two out of three at home. 2007 was a different story though. The Orioles won two out of three in Washington, but then got swept in Baltimore. Two of those six games went extra innings. 2008 didn't let the Orioles gain back any ground in the series, as they would again split six games and again each team won two out of three at home. The final game that year went 12 innings. After 11, the score was 1-1, and the Orioles scored a run in top of the 12th when Adam Jones hit a single to score Nick Markakis to make it 2-1. But in the bottom of the 12, George Sherill gave up a 2-run home run to Ronnie Belliard. Nationals win 3-2. Ouch.    2009 was better for the O's though. They won four out of six, getting two out of three in both Baltimore and Washington. Strangely, the very first game between the two that year was also a 12-inning game. This time, with the game tied 2-2, Adam Jones would (again) get a hit (this time, 2 RBIs) to put the O's ahead 4-2. George Sherill would (again) come on for the save, but this time he got the job the done and the Orioles won. By the end of the season, the series was back at a tie - 12-12.    2010 was the start of the Orioles dominating the Nationals. They won four out of six, including another extra inning game - which they lost, but seriously, what's with these teams? After 2010, the Orioles were up in the head-to-head 16-14. The two teams split the series in 2011, with each team winning three games. No extra inning games that year, though the Orioles did lose the first one 17-5. The less said about that, the better. In 2012, the Orioles again won four out of six. Like a lot of Orioles games that year, most of them were close contests. Four games were decided by one run (all of which the Orioles won). Wei-Yen Chen got hit with the loss in both games the Orioles did lose. Guys who got wins for the Orioles included Kevin Gregg, Pedro Strop, and Jason Hammel. Was that really only in 2012? Feels like longer.    2013 saw the switch to a four game series format, two consecutive games at home and away. Personally, I like this better for inter-league rival play. If we're not going to have inter-league play be anything special anymore, at least it could be given some distinction with the home and away series. Anyway, the Orioles won three out of four that year. The funny thing is that in their three wins, the Orioles beat Gio Gonzalez, Jordan Zimmerman, and Dan Haren. They lost to Zach Duke, who's currently pitching out of the White Sox bullpen. Kevin Gausman lost that game after giving up seven runs in four innings. Not great, Goose. But the Orioles would improve their record over the Nationals to 26-20. Last year should have been another home and home series, but one of the games in DC was rained out, which pushed it into August. The first game may have been one of the stranger games I remember watching. After they carried a 2-2 tie into the 11th inning, the Orioles exploded for six runs to win 8-2. That inning featured home runs by Chris Davis, J.J Hardy, and Manny Machado, and sac bunt by TJ McFarland. I'm pretty sure there was also a rain delay in that game, so by the time it ended it was pretty late - but if you stayed up to watch it you got quite the ending. The final game (the makeup in August and the last time these two teams played) was another good one. The Orioles were down 3-2 going into the 7th. Tanner Roark had been pitching very well and it wasn't looking good. I was at the game, and there was a definite feel among the (many) O's fans in attendance that things weren't going to end well. But in the top of the 7th, the Orioles would get six hits, broken up only by a sacrifice bunt by Caleb Joseph before ending the inning on a double play ground out. They scored three runs. Then in the eighth they scored two more on four hits and a passed ball. That gave the Orioles a 7-3 lead they wouldn't give up. Needless to say, we didn't leave disappointed that night.    So that brings us up to this year. Since the teams started playing every season in 2006, the Orioles are 29-21 against the Nationals and haven't lost a season series against them since 2007. We're also right about that MASN thing, by the way. Pitching Matchups: Who knows? I just went to MLB.com and each game is listed as TBD for both teams. Roch Kubatko tweeted earlier today that Tillman is expected to take the mound since it's his turn, so - OK. Surprisingly, Washington's rotation isn't that great this year. Strasburg has been hurt, Gonzalez and Zimmerman haven't looked as strong as last year, and Doug Fister has a losing record. But they did get Max Scherzer in the offseason, and I expect the Orioles will see him on Sunday. Scherzer may be the best pitcher in the NL this year. He nearly pitched back-to-back no-hitters. He's been good. The thing is the last time the Orioles saw Scherzer was in Game 1 of the ALDS when they it him up for five earned runs in 7.1 innings. So yeah, not that worried. Other Notes: - Ian Desmond, who plays shortstop for the Nats, has 20 errors on the season. That's a lot and leads the NL by five. Somehow though, Marcus Semien makes Desmond look good with 27 in the AL. - The Nationals real dominance comes at home. On the road they're 21-22. This isn't much different from the Orioles, who have a much better record at home and are losers on the road. For this weekend though, all that matters is the Orioles are at home, giving them a better chance to win. - Back in April I proclaimed to a friend of mine who roots for the Yankees that the Orioles would have a better record at the All-Star break. If the Orioles sweep and the Yankees get swept, this would be true. The Yankees are playing a three game series in Boston this weekend, so...go Sox.    Prediction: Nope, not doing it. I would like to see the Orioles at least be at .500 going into the break and as long as they don't get swept they can do that. Yes, that's a low bar. This is where we are. Let's just hope for better times post-Cincinnati.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The O\xe2\x80\x99s did a good job of working the count against Gio Gonzalez. They saw a lot of pitches, just were unable to put a lot of good swings on balls with two strikes.\xc2\xa0 There were also several at-bats where the batter struck out looking, as they were looking for the wrong pitch.But, once again the star of this game for the Orioles was their defense. The team turned several nifty double plays, with Jonathan Schoop the center of attention for most of them.

The Orioles probably have better numbers as a pitching staff against Harper than anyone else. And when Wilson Ramos is batting fourth, it shows the importance of getting Harper out.The Orioles will remain second in the AL East with the win, as the Yankees won as well. In that game, Clay Buchholz left with an elbow injury. If he is lost for any amount of time, it will be a major blow for the Boston Red Sox.The Orioles will now have to face Jordan Zimmermann and Max Scherzer to end the first half of the season up to the All-Star break.

With Jones at the plate in the last of the third and Manny Machado on first, Machado was thrown out stealing to end the inning.

And on the first pitch he saw Jones opened up his bat and smacked the thing out of the ballpark.However unfortunately for the Orioles, that 1-0 was never going to stand up for the entire night. And in fact it was very short-lived. In the fifth after two singles and a double-play, Washington had two outs and a runner at third.

Taylor would follow that up with an immediate RBI-single, and suddenly the Orioles were slowly bleeding to death as they trailed 2-1.Tillman got out of the inning unscathed from that point on, however it did dawn on me that the Orioles were losing in effect to an NL team who had taken over the game by playing the NL style of play \xe2\x80\x93 in an AL park.

The defending AL East champions were in first place with a 41-34 record before the current slide.Coming off a six-game stretch in which they went 1 for 36 with runners in scoring position, the Orioles definitely need to escape the diamond.""I want these guys to get as far away from it as they can, take some pride in the way they\'ve competed and knowing that it\'s still there for them,"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""I think our best baseball is ahead of us.""Scherzer (10-7) allowed only three hits over the first eight innings and allowed only three base runners until Jones homered with two outs in the ninth.Drew Storen entered and struck out Chris Davis to earn his 27th save.Scherzer outpitched Chen (4-5), who gave up three runs and eight hits in a career-high tying eight innings.""He\'s a great pitcher and a player that I respect a lot,"" Chen, speaking through an interpreter, said of Scherzer. ""Watching him pitch, I learn a lot from him. Today, his pitching was just great.""Chen has a 2.78 ERA, but only four wins to show for it.""Wei-Yin\'s been solid for us,"" Showalter acknowledged.Scherzer was selected to the NL All-Star team, but he chose not to pitch in Tuesday\'s game. Though the right-hander certainly deserves a chance to show his stuff on the grand stage in Cincinnati, the Nationals gave him a $210 million, seven-year contract in January to help the team win the NL East and excel in the postseason.""He\'s a team guy,"" Washington\'s Dan Uggla said. ""There is never a doubt he wanted to pitch today, although I\'m sure he wanted to pitch in the All-Star Game. The team came first.""Scherzer has accounted for more than a fifth of first-place Washington\'s 48 wins, and his 2.11 ERA ranks among the league leaders.Yunel Escobar had three hits and scored a run for the Nationals, who won two of three from their neighboring rivals.This game started well for Baltimore, performing before a third straight sellout crowd at Camden Yards.With runners on second and third with two outs in the top of the first, Davis made a nice running catch of Wilson Ramos\' liner to right-center.Scherzer struck out the first two batters in the bottom half before Jones hit a 1-2 pitch into the seats in left field.Jones\' second homer was his 180th with the Orioles, pushing him past Frank Robinson into eighth place on the team\'s list.Washington used three straight two-out hits to take a 3-1 lead in the fourth. After singles by Escobar and Clint Robinson put runners on first and second, Uggla singled in a run and Tyler Moore followed with a two-run double.Scherzer made the lead stand up to avoid a third straight loss for the first time since May 2010.SERIES NOTESThe Orioles lead the series 36-32, including 23-14 at home. They meet for three games in Washington in September. The Nationals\' lone series win over a season came in 2007.TRAINER\'S ROOMNationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (oblique) won\'t return from his second stint on the DL unless he\'s close to 100 percent. ""He\'s healing up. Don\'t want to rush him,"" manager Matt Williams said.Orioles: Davis was back in the lineup after missing Saturday\'s game with a stomach virus.ON DECKNationals: Washington returns from the break Friday to launch a three-game series against the NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers.Orioles: Baltimore opens the second half with a nine-game road trip that begins Friday night in Detroit.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

He was projected as the fourth starter, and a consistent 2014 season earned him a wealth of trust from fans.\xc2\xa0However, after wrangling together a 6-plus ERA this year, Bud has found himself a position in the bullpen that does not look to be temporary.Wright and Wilson have definitely been intriguing, but their appearances seem to only have been injury-alleviating spot starts. Coach Buck Showalter \xe2\x80\x94 extremely mindful of his young players\xe2\x80\x99 confidence \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0very cautious about calling\xc2\xa0up pitchers before they\xe2\x80\x99re ready. I think, barring injury, Wright and Wilson will stay in the minor leagues for the majority of the second half.Now to Kevin Gausman. Currently in AAA Norfolk, Gausman is going to get the first crack at becoming the fifth starter for the O\xe2\x80\x99s after the All-Star break. Dubbed as the team\xe2\x80\x99s future ace, this was supposed to be his breakout year.It has not been. No one will argue that. But the season is far from over.In fact, he really hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had much experience in 2015. After starting the season in the bullpen, Gausman has only pitched in 27 major league innings this year\xe2\x80\x93 this includes three starting appearances.His bullpen work was acceptable, yet unimpressive. But saving the arm of the team\xe2\x80\x99s top pitching prospect for the second half of the season may have been exactly the\xc2\xa0plan of Buck Showalter and his Orioles.In his three starts, Gausman has done well twice. His third and most recent time \xe2\x80\x94 July 7 at the Twins \xe2\x80\x94 was a disaster, as he handed over 8 runs in 3.2 innings.His future is a mystery, but I know the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 organization has a lot of faith in the young pitcher. In 2017 and further, the team will likely rely on Gausman as their number one pitcher. In 2015, however, their playoff hopes hinge on him simply becoming a consistent bottom-of-the-rotation guy.Last year, Kevin started 20 games and posted a 3.57 ERA. Improvement would be wonderful, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen how well the rest of the O\xe2\x80\x99s staff has pitched \xe2\x80\x94 a repeat season from Gausman is going to be all the Orioles need this year.

However, this season, they end the first half with a record of 44-44.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are fourth in the American League and fifth overall with 110 home runs headed into the break.

Wei-Yin Chen and Miguel Gonzalez lead the team with 17 each. The team as a whole has allowed 93 home runs to this point in the season.The MASN broadcasts have repeatedly said the O\xe2\x80\x99s score the majority of their runs via the long ball. Most of the time it is over 40% of their runs come from home runs. This stat is not necessarily a good thing.When the offense is struggling, home runs do not help when there are no runners on base. A perfect example is the last game of the half against the Washington Nationals. Max Scherzer pitched an excellent game, in which, he only allowed four hits along the way of recording 26 outs before the closer came on to record the last out. The Orioles are not hitting enough tw0 or three-run home runs. The solo shots are not helping the offense, but is hurting the team.The game ended in a 3-2 loss for the Birds, and how did they score those two runs? You probably guessed it: by the long ball.Adam Jones hit two solo shots out, and traditionally, a two home runs in a game would be a good thing. However, the O\xe2\x80\x99s offense is struggling, so they were unable to put any runners on base.An ace who has already pitched a no-hitter this season did not help the situation. Even against an excellent pitcher, home runs cannot help the offense if no one managed to make it on base. They do not necessarily have to be hits, but they could draw walks also.The Orioles are 13th in the AL in walks drawn. They are a very aggressive team, and in turn, they do not draw many walks.Their pitching has allowed the third most walks in the AL. Chen has helped minimize the home run damage by allowing 14 of his 17 when the bases are empty.Gonzalez has tried to minimize the damage also. Ten of his 17 home runs allowed were hit with the bases empty. However, five of them have been three-run bombs. When they say teams live and die by the home run, it is especially true for the Birds.

Their offense is focused on the dingers, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t see them switching around the way they play to something similar to small ball.Of their 254 extra-base hits, 144 (minus the home runs) were either doubles or triples. In comparison, the top three in the AL in extra-base hits have more than 160 doubles and triples combined. Two of those teams are the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays.If the Orioles want to continue with their reliance on the home run, they have to increase their other extra-base hits.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsIt is very difficult to not feel a good bit of disappointment in the first half of the 2015 season for the Baltimore Orioles. Just when it looked like they had turned it around with an 18-5 stretch, they did a face plant into the All-Star break with a 3-10 record \xe2\x80\x93 dropping from seven games above .500 to a perfect 44-44.The small amount of comfort to be taken from this mediocre performance is of course that only the Yankees are truly better off, and that being only four games. But it could be so different \xe2\x80\xa6 probably should be.

And there is a reasonable hope for that, a hope that can be considered both historically and in terms of personnel expectations. Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at each.Historical ConsiderationsSince Buck Showalter became manager of the Baltimore Orioles, the Orioles have had better second half records in three out of four seasons. Also, the Birds were 34-23 at the end of 2010 when he became the manager, and they were 37-37 in the second half (final record of 66-96). The only year that featured a poorer latter portion of the season was 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 much attributable to the bullpen meltdowns that plagued that squad.Here are the splits of records and win percentages over the recent past \xe2\x80\xa6YearBefore ASG.pct beforeAfter ASG.pct after201136-52.40933-41.446201245-40.52948-29.623201353-43.55232-34.485201452-42.55344-24.647201544-44.500??-??.???\xc2\xa0I think it is a generally true evaluation that Showalter and the Orioles have figured out as seasons progress how to maximize personnel and win a better percentage of games than in the earlier portion of each year. At the same time, it is really sad to look at the first half numbers of the previous three years to see that they were 5, 10, and 10 games over .500 \xe2\x80\xa6 which really makes this season look grim by comparison.Personnel ConsiderationsOne would have to expect that the quality of the players on the Orioles would lead to expectations of a better cumulative contributory performance. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to just sound like Buck, who puts a pretty face on things \xe2\x80\x93 not to be critical in saying that, I\xe2\x80\x99d do the same in his position. He recently reflected with the beat writers about the injured players who have now returned, along with his belief in the depth of the system.But thinking logically through this:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s ask ourselves how many of the Orioles players have lived up to expectations? And I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking about high-level, career-year performances \xe2\x80\xa6 just up to what you\xe2\x80\x99d hope from them in a solid year.Certainly there is Manny Machado. We would add Ubaldo Jimenez, Wei-Yin Chen, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Zach Britton to that list. It could be argued the Adam Jones is on it as well, or at least close to it. There have been surprisingly nice contributions from Chaz Roe and Jimmy Paredes \xe2\x80\x93 though the latter can disappear at times.But beyond that list, there is a lot of disappointment. Hopes were for Delmon Young and Alejandro De Aza to be regulars, but they are gone. Bud Norris and Chris Tillman would be on the hugely disappointing list \xe2\x80\xa6 and probably add Steve Pearce. We need to see more from J.J. Hardy, and Matt Wieters started well but has now cooled off. And certainly it would be great to get more out of Caleb Joseph, Travis Snider, Tommy Hunter, Brian Matusz, etc.\xc2\xa0 And Chris Davis is his own mixed bag of results.In an excellent article today, Steve Melewski of MASN stole my thunder before I could write about it \xe2\x80\x93 speaking of how (with statistical proof) that the Orioles are actually almost identical to 2014 in total offensive production (although, to be accurate, much of these big numbers came from a handful of big offensive games). The bigger issue has been the pitching, especially the starting pitching.All of this is to say that there are plenty of players who should perform better in the second half than there are those who are likely to cool off. But the rotation needs to replicate their second half of last year. Assuming that Jimenez and Chen can remain consistent, one would expect Gonzalez and especially Tillman to improve markedly. Add to this a healthy return of Kevin Gausman, and this could look like a different team entirely. Even as currently constructed, it should be the team to win the A.L. East; but the devil is in the details.We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue with more of these similar thoughts over the next couple of days.Next: Orioles have to win more close games\xc2\xa0 ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Tough hours in Birdland - Birds Watcher', 'Next1 of 5Prev postUse your \xe2\x86\x90 \xe2\x86\x92 (arrows) to browseMany fans right now are harping on the fact that the Baltimore Orioles are only at .500 at the all-star break.

The Orioles found themselves in the middle of racial tensions in the city of Baltimore, and in my view they showed the nation and the world what Baltimore is truly about.\\u00a0<div class=\\""related-tags remove-native-227\\""><span class=\\""related-main-title\\"">Live Feed <span class=\\""related-name\\"">buck showalter<\\/span><\\/span><ul><li><a class=\\""related-post\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/yanksgoyard.com\\/2017\\/05\\/11\\/yankees-derek-jeter-week\\/?utm_source=FanSided&utm_medium=Network&utm_campaign=RelatedTag\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""related-tag-shortcode\\""><img src=\\""http:\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/usat-images\\/2016\\/04\\/8105079-mlb-baltimore-orioles-at-new-york-yankees-268x162.jpeg\\""\\/><span class=\\""post-title has-image\\"">Yankees Derek Jeter week rolls on; Here\'s what\'s happening<\\/span> <\\/a><span class=\\""site\\"">Yanks Go Yard<\\/span><\\/li><li><a class=\\""related-post\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/fansided.com\\/2017\\/05\\/05\\/10-things-learned-mlb-season\\/?utm_source=FanSided&utm_medium=Network&utm_campaign=RelatedTag\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""related-tag-shortcode\\""><span class=\\""post-title\\"">10 things we\'ve learned so far this MLB season<\\/span> <\\/a><span class=\\""site\\"">FanSided<\\/span><\\/li><li><a class=\\""related-post\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/fansided.com\\/2017\\/05\\/02\\/baltimore-orioles-execute-weird-triple-play-on-boston-red-sox-video\\/?utm_source=FanSided&utm_medium=Network&utm_campaign=RelatedTag\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""related-tag-shortcode\\""><span class=\\""post-title\\"">Baltimore Orioles execute a weird triple play on Boston Red Sox<\\/span> <\\/a><span class=\\""site\\"">FanSided<\\/span><\\/li><li><a class=\\""related-post\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/thebaltimorewire.com\\/2017\\/04\\/29\\/baltimore-orioles-resilient-club\\/?utm_source=FanSided&utm_medium=Network&utm_campaign=RelatedTag\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""related-tag-shortcode\\""><span class=\\""post-title\\"">Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck Showalter<\\/span> <\\/a><span class=\\""site\\"">The Baltimore Wire<\\/span><\\/li><li><a class=\\""related-post\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/thebaltimorewire.com\\/2017\\/04\\/25\\/baltimore-orioles-memorable-ejections\\/?utm_source=FanSided&utm_medium=Network&utm_campaign=RelatedTag\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""related-tag-shortcode\\""><span class=\\""post-title\\"">Baltimore Orioles: Buck Showalter\'s Most Memorable Ejections<\\/span> <\\/a><span class=\\""site\\"">The Baltimore Wire<\\/span><\\/li><li><a class=\\""related-post\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/thebaltimorewire.com\\/2017\\/04\\/23\\/baltimore-orioles-cant-stop-wont-stop\\/?utm_source=FanSided&utm_medium=Network&utm_campaign=RelatedTag\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""related-tag-shortcode\\""><span class=\\""post-title\\"">Baltimore Orioles Clicking on All Cylinders<\\/span> <\\/a><span class=\\""site\\"">The Baltimore Wire<\\/span><\\/li><\\/ul><\\/div><\\/p>\\n<p>So I wanted to take a look back at those tough days, because as difficult of a time as it was for the city, it also gave the Orioles the opportunity to in effect be the face of Baltimore. At a moment when the city so desperately needed something to go right, it shouldn&#8217;t be forgotten that it&#8217;s Orioles did what they could to give people respite from the real world which hit home so hard and so fast. April of 2015 is not a time that will soon be forgotten &#8211; nor should it be. However the city should be proud of how it recovered from that carnage, and the Orioles should be proud of the role they played in it.<\\/p>\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p><!\\u2014pageview_candidate\\u2014>""},{""title"":""Baltimore Orioles: Tough hours in Birdland"",""permalink"":""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2015\\/07\\/14\\/baltimore-orioles-tough-hours-in-birdland\\/2\\/"",""shortCodeTitle"":null,""content"":""<div id=\\""attachment_42112\\""  class=\\""wp-caption aligncenter\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/koji-uehara-david-lough-mlb-boston-red-sox-baltimore-orioles.jpg\\""><img class=\\""size-medium wp-image-42112\\"" src=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/koji-uehara-david-lough-mlb-boston-red-sox-baltimore-orioles-300x600.jpg\\"" alt=\\""Photo: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\\"" width=\\""300\\"" height=\\""200\\"" srcset=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/koji-uehara-david-lough-mlb-boston-red-sox-baltimore-orioles-300x600.jpg 300w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/koji-uehara-david-lough-mlb-boston-red-sox-baltimore-orioles-590x900.jpg 590w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/koji-uehara-david-lough-mlb-boston-red-sox-baltimore-orioles.jpg 850w\\"" sizes=\\""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\"" \\/><\\/a>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\""fs-center-img\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\""wp-caption-text\\"" style=\\""width:300px;\\"">Photo: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports<\\/p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\n<p style=\\""text-align: center\\""><strong>1) David Lough walks off Boston amid tensions<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">On April 25th the O&#8217;s found themselves with a 3-2 lead against division-rival Boston in the top of the ninth.

Sunday, April 26th came and went without incident. However Monday, April 27th brought us a much worse situation, as the violence re-commenced &#8211; and worsened at that. The situation became a full-scale riot at that time, canceling the Orioles&#8217; series-opener against the ChiSox, along with game two the next night. At this point both teams and the league were quickly looking for viable options to play games at all, as it became clear that Baltimore wasn&#8217;t an option.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">Games one and two of the ChiSox series were rescheduled as part of a doubleheader later in the year. However game three was played on it&#8217;s previously scheduled day, Wednesday, April 29th. The game was moved to an afternoon times slot given the fact that the city faced a curfew imposed by the mayor at night. There was also a twist to this game, never before seen in MLB circles: it was closed to the public. For the first time in league history, a game was played literally in front of no fans.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">This of course was done due to the fact that the police had to use their resources in other places due to the nature of what was going on in the city at that time, and public safety couldn&#8217;t be guaranteed. For the record, the Orioles defeated the ChiSox that day 8-2, at an eerily quiet Oriole Park at Camden Yards. But legions of fans gathered outside the ballpark gates in left field, peering into the game. In what became the personification of a community trying to take it&#8217;s city back, people stood there watching the game, listening on the radio, etc. It was almost like a big tailgate party during the game.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">During the national anthem, the players themselves shouted &#8220;O!&#8221; in a show of loyalty to the city. However they also heard that familiar yell from the fans gathered outside, and thus they knew that the people were with them. Throughout the game, the faint roar of those people was also audible on television. While the circumstances of not letting people into the stands was incredibly sad and unfortunate, it also gave us the image of Baltimore rising from the ashes like a Phoenix &#8211; by way of the people watching through the gates.\\u00a0<div class=\\""next-post lg slider\\""><a class=\\""location\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""next-post-shortcode\\"" href=\\""#\\""><span class=\\""next\\"">Next: <\\/span><span>Home games at the Trop<\\/span><\\/a><\\/div><\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\""><!\\u2014pageview_candidate\\u2014>""},{""title"":""Baltimore Orioles: Tough hours in Birdland"",""permalink"":""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2015\\/07\\/14\\/baltimore-orioles-tough-hours-in-birdland\\/4\\/"",""shortCodeTitle"":null,""content"":""<\\/p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div id=\\""attachment_42103\\""  class=\\""wp-caption aligncenter\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles.jpg\\""><img class=\\""size-medium wp-image-42103\\"" src=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles-300x600.jpg\\"" alt=\\""Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports\\"" width=\\""300\\"" height=\\""200\\"" srcset=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles-300x600.jpg 300w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles-590x900.jpg 590w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles.jpg 850w\\"" sizes=\\""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\"" \\/><\\/a>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\""fs-center-img\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\""wp-caption-text\\"" style=\\""width:300px;\\"">Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports<\\/p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\n<p><strong>3) Home games in Tampa<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>The 2015 riots in Baltimore didn&#8217;t only affect series&#8217; against the BoSox and ChiSox &#8211; the Orioles were supposed to close out that home stand over the weekend of May 1-3 with a visit from Tampa. However again, that series was unable to be played as originally scheduled due to the fact that there was a curfew in the city, and the police obviously had other concerns. There was a lot of talk of various contingencies, including playing Friday and Saturday&#8217;s games in the afternoon (along with Sunday&#8217;s previously scheduled day game), or potentially moving the series to either Washington or Philadelphia. (At the end of the day, apparently neither the Nationals or Phillies were contacted about using either ballpark.)<\\/p>\\n<p>So that weekend&#8217;s series ended up being played at Tampa&#8217;s Tropicana Field &#8211; with the Orioles classified as the home team. You can kind of look at it as an upside-down type of weekend in a sense; the games were played in Tampa&#8217;s home park, with the Orioles wearing their home whites (and Tampa their road grays), hitting last in the inning, and thus having the advantages of being at home &#8211; between the lines, that is. They also collected all of the gate and concessions revenue, after Tampa had covered their costs for producing the games.<\\/p>\\n<p>At the time, I thought this was the least of all evils. However I&#8217;ve rethought that just a bit. On one hand, it is very difficult to be overly critical given the circumstances. MLB, the Orioles, and the Tampa Rays had to come up with a solution very quickly to a bad situation. However if Washington wasn&#8217;t an option for whatever reason, what they could and should have done is moved the games to <strong><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/www.baseball-reference.com\\/player_search.cgi?results=smithed03,smithed05&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-birdswatcher.com\\"" target=\\""_blank\\"" rel=\\""nofollow\\"">Ed Smith<\\/a><\\/strong> Stadium in Sarasota &#8211; the spring home of the Orioles. This probably would have given the Orioles some semblance of home field advantage (given how Sarasota supports them), and it would have been a ballpark with which they were familiar in terms of it being their home field every spring. But again, it&#8217;s tough to be critical given the circumstances.<\\/p>\\n<p>But the fact that the O&#8217;s were on the field at all helped the city and community of Baltimore. They shone through in a time when the city needed any ounce of daylight it could muster, and the Orioles themselves really picked the city up when it was sorely needed. The fact that they took two-of-three from Tampa to close out the &#8220;home stand&#8221; didn&#8217;t hurt either.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\""next-post lg\\""><a class=\\""location\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""next-post-shortcode\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2015\\/07\\/10\\/baltimore-orioles-open-the-battle-of-the-beltways-vs-dc\\/\\""><span class=\\""next\\"">Next: <\\/span><span>Baltimore Orioles open the Battle of the Beltways vs. DC<\\/span><\\/a><\\/div>\\n<div class=\\""recent-posts-info\\""><h4>More from Birds Watcher<\\/h4><ul><li class=\\""recent\\""><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2017\\/02\\/20\\/baltimore-orioles-adding-vidal-nuno-helps-fill-bullpen\\/\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""recent-posts-shortcode\\"">Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen<\\/a><span class=\\""time-ago\\"">11w ago<\\/span><\\/li><li class=\\""recent\\""><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2017\\/02\\/20\\/baltimore-orioles-previewing-2017-season\\/\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""recent-posts-shortcode\\"">Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season<\\/a><span class=\\""time-ago\\"">11w ago<\\/span><\\/li><li class=\\""recent\\""><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2017\\/02\\/19\\/baltimore-orioles-manny-machado-and-os-have-not-discussed-extension\\/\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""recent-posts-shortcode\\"">Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O&#8217;s have not discussed extension<\\/a><span class=\\""time-ago\\"">11w ago<\\/span><\\/li><li class=\\""recent\\""><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2017\\/02\\/19\\/baltimore-orioles-os-receive-good-news-about-j-j-hardys-back\\/\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""recent-posts-shortcode\\"">Baltimore Orioles: O&#8217;s receive good news about J.J.

The Orioles found themselves in the middle of racial tensions in the city of Baltimore, and in my view they showed the nation and the world what Baltimore is truly about.\\u00a0<div class=\\""related-tags remove-native-227\\""><span class=\\""related-main-title\\"">Live Feed <span class=\\""related-name\\"">buck showalter<\\/span><\\/span><ul><li><a class=\\""related-post\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/yanksgoyard.com\\/2017\\/05\\/11\\/yankees-derek-jeter-week\\/?utm_source=FanSided&utm_medium=Network&utm_campaign=RelatedTag\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""related-tag-shortcode\\""><img src=\\""http:\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/usat-images\\/2016\\/04\\/8105079-mlb-baltimore-orioles-at-new-york-yankees-268x162.jpeg\\""\\/><span class=\\""post-title has-image\\"">Yankees Derek Jeter week rolls on; Here\'s what\'s happening<\\/span> <\\/a><span class=\\""site\\"">Yanks Go Yard<\\/span><\\/li><li><a class=\\""related-post\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/fansided.com\\/2017\\/05\\/05\\/10-things-learned-mlb-season\\/?utm_source=FanSided&utm_medium=Network&utm_campaign=RelatedTag\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""related-tag-shortcode\\""><span class=\\""post-title\\"">10 things we\'ve learned so far this MLB season<\\/span> <\\/a><span class=\\""site\\"">FanSided<\\/span><\\/li><li><a class=\\""related-post\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/fansided.com\\/2017\\/05\\/02\\/baltimore-orioles-execute-weird-triple-play-on-boston-red-sox-video\\/?utm_source=FanSided&utm_medium=Network&utm_campaign=RelatedTag\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""related-tag-shortcode\\""><span class=\\""post-title\\"">Baltimore Orioles execute a weird triple play on Boston Red Sox<\\/span> <\\/a><span class=\\""site\\"">FanSided<\\/span><\\/li><li><a class=\\""related-post\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/thebaltimorewire.com\\/2017\\/04\\/29\\/baltimore-orioles-resilient-club\\/?utm_source=FanSided&utm_medium=Network&utm_campaign=RelatedTag\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""related-tag-shortcode\\""><span class=\\""post-title\\"">Baltimore Orioles: A Resilient Club Under Buck Showalter<\\/span> <\\/a><span class=\\""site\\"">The Baltimore Wire<\\/span><\\/li><li><a class=\\""related-post\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/thebaltimorewire.com\\/2017\\/04\\/25\\/baltimore-orioles-memorable-ejections\\/?utm_source=FanSided&utm_medium=Network&utm_campaign=RelatedTag\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""related-tag-shortcode\\""><span class=\\""post-title\\"">Baltimore Orioles: Buck Showalter\'s Most Memorable Ejections<\\/span> <\\/a><span class=\\""site\\"">The Baltimore Wire<\\/span><\\/li><li><a class=\\""related-post\\"" href=\\""http:\\/\\/thebaltimorewire.com\\/2017\\/04\\/23\\/baltimore-orioles-cant-stop-wont-stop\\/?utm_source=FanSided&utm_medium=Network&utm_campaign=RelatedTag\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""related-tag-shortcode\\""><span class=\\""post-title\\"">Baltimore Orioles Clicking on All Cylinders<\\/span> <\\/a><span class=\\""site\\"">The Baltimore Wire<\\/span><\\/li><\\/ul><\\/div><\\/p>\\n<p>So I wanted to take a look back at those tough days, because as difficult of a time as it was for the city, it also gave the Orioles the opportunity to in effect be the face of Baltimore.

April of 2015 is not a time that will soon be forgotten &#8211; nor should it be.

To make matters worse for the Orioles, <strong><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/www.baseball-reference.com\\/players\\/b\\/bogaexa01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-birdswatcher.com\\"" target=\\""_blank\\"" rel=\\""nofollow\\"">Xander Bogaerts<\\/a><\\/strong> homered in the top of the tenth to give Boston a 4-3 lead.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">However baseball rules tell us that the home team always gets the last at-bat.

That brought David Lough to the plate, and he provided his first ever walk off home run. The deep shot over the right field wall sent Camden Yards into a frenzy, and it gave the Orioles an improbable 5-4 win.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">This game is notable of course because it was played under heavy duress in the city of Baltimore. Tensions from the Freddie Gray death in the city began to boil over, as protesters converged onto the Camden Yards site &#8211; even before the game. Stores were looted, windows broken, and violence broke out. Quite frankly it&#8217;s a good thing that the game went to extra innings, as at one point the Baltimore City Police ordered all people at the game to remain in the ballpark until further notice. (By the time the game actually ended that order had been lifted.)<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">Through twitter and other social media, most of the fans in the ballpark were aware of what was going on outside. So this was a good moment for the city in a sense, because it gave Baltimore something to hang it&#8217;s hat on &#8211; the walk off win, that is. At the time we thought that might have been the worst of the tensions, however unfortunately that wasn&#8217;t to be the case.

Sunday, April 26th came and went without incident. However Monday, April 27th brought us a much worse situation, as the violence re-commenced &#8211; and worsened at that. The situation became a full-scale riot at that time, canceling the Orioles&#8217; series-opener against the ChiSox, along with game two the next night. At this point both teams and the league were quickly looking for viable options to play games at all, as it became clear that Baltimore wasn&#8217;t an option.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">Games one and two of the ChiSox series were rescheduled as part of a doubleheader later in the year. However game three was played on it&#8217;s previously scheduled day, Wednesday, April 29th. The game was moved to an afternoon times slot given the fact that the city faced a curfew imposed by the mayor at night. There was also a twist to this game, never before seen in MLB circles: it was closed to the public. For the first time in league history, a game was played literally in front of no fans.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">This of course was done due to the fact that the police had to use their resources in other places due to the nature of what was going on in the city at that time, and public safety couldn&#8217;t be guaranteed. For the record, the Orioles defeated the ChiSox that day 8-2, at an eerily quiet Oriole Park at Camden Yards. But legions of fans gathered outside the ballpark gates in left field, peering into the game. In what became the personification of a community trying to take it&#8217;s city back, people stood there watching the game, listening on the radio, etc. It was almost like a big tailgate party during the game.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\"">During the national anthem, the players themselves shouted &#8220;O!&#8221; in a show of loyalty to the city. However they also heard that familiar yell from the fans gathered outside, and thus they knew that the people were with them. Throughout the game, the faint roar of those people was also audible on television. While the circumstances of not letting people into the stands was incredibly sad and unfortunate, it also gave us the image of Baltimore rising from the ashes like a Phoenix &#8211; by way of the people watching through the gates.\\u00a0<div class=\\""next-post lg slider\\""><a class=\\""location\\"" data-track=\\""shortcode\\"" data-track-action=\\""next-post-shortcode\\"" href=\\""#\\""><span class=\\""next\\"">Next: <\\/span><span>Home games at the Trop<\\/span><\\/a><\\/div><\\/p>\\n<p style=\\""text-align: left\\""><!\\u2014pageview_candidate\\u2014>""},{""title"":""Baltimore Orioles: Tough hours in Birdland - Page 2"",""permalink"":""http:\\/\\/birdswatcher.com\\/2015\\/07\\/14\\/baltimore-orioles-tough-hours-in-birdland\\/4\\/"",""shortCodeTitle"":null,""content"":""<\\/p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div id=\\""attachment_42103\\""  class=\\""wp-caption aligncenter\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles.jpg\\""><img class=\\""size-medium wp-image-42103\\"" src=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles-300x600.jpg\\"" alt=\\""Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports\\"" width=\\""300\\"" height=\\""200\\"" srcset=\\""\\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles-300x600.jpg 300w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles-590x900.jpg 590w, \\/\\/cdn.fansided.com\\/wp-content\\/blogs.dir\\/11\\/files\\/2015\\/05\\/mlb-tampa-bay-rays-baltimore-orioles.jpg 850w\\"" sizes=\\""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\"" \\/><\\/a>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\""fs-center-img\\"">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\\""wp-caption-text\\"" style=\\""width:300px;\\"">Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports<\\/p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\n<p><strong>3) Home games in Tampa<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>The 2015 riots in Baltimore didn&#8217;t only affect series&#8217; against the BoSox and ChiSox &#8211; the Orioles were supposed to close out that home stand over the weekend of May 1-3 with a visit from Tampa. However again, that series was unable to be played as originally scheduled due to the fact that there was a curfew in the city, and the police obviously had other concerns. There was a lot of talk of various contingencies, including playing Friday and Saturday&#8217;s games in the afternoon (along with Sunday&#8217;s previously scheduled day game), or potentially moving the series to either Washington or Philadelphia. (At the end of the day, apparently neither the Nationals or Phillies were contacted about using either ballpark.)<\\/p>\\n<p>So that weekend&#8217;s series ended up being played at Tampa&#8217;s Tropicana Field &#8211; with the Orioles classified as the home team. You can kind of look at it as an upside-down type of weekend in a sense; the games were played in Tampa&#8217;s home park, with the Orioles wearing their home whites (and Tampa their road grays), hitting last in the inning, and thus having the advantages of being at home &#8211; between the lines, that is. They also collected all of the gate and concessions revenue, after Tampa had covered their costs for producing the games.<\\/p>\\n<p>At the time, I thought this was the least of all evils. However I&#8217;ve rethought that just a bit. On one hand, it is very difficult to be overly critical given the circumstances. MLB, the Orioles, and the Tampa Rays had to come up with a solution very quickly to a bad situation. However if Washington wasn&#8217;t an option for whatever reason, what they could and should have done is moved the games to <strong><a href=\\""http:\\/\\/www.baseball-reference.com\\/player_search.cgi?results=smithed03,smithed05&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-birdswatcher.com\\"" target=\\""_blank\\"" rel=\\""nofollow\\"">Ed Smith<\\/a><\\/strong> Stadium in Sarasota &#8211; the spring home of the Orioles. This probably would have given the Orioles some semblance of home field advantage (given how Sarasota supports them), and it would have been a ballpark with which they were familiar in terms of it being their home field every spring. But again, it&#8217;s tough to be critical given the circumstances.<\\/p>\\n<p>But the fact that the O&#8217;s were on the field at all helped the city and community of Baltimore.

From pitching to the batters, Viv breaks down we he believes the Orioles have underachieved, but also have the chance to still win this division ultimately.

The St. Louis Cardinals won 12-4. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY SportsThe AL East in which the Baltimore Orioles play is the only division in baseball where everyone has to realistically still feel like they can win the division. And because of that, I think the moves made at the trade deadline (or lack thereof) could determine who wins the division.Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at each team, based on their current spot in the standings, and see who could be just a few of the potential trade targets.New York Yankees \xe2\x80\x93 Ben Zobrist, Dan Haren, Bartolo ColonI documented in my post on each team\xe2\x80\x99s weaknesses that middle infield is a true weakness for the Yankees. Well, Zobrist can play both 2B and SS. While it appears Rob Refsnyder is going to remain with the club, I still think another player may be wanted.\xc2\xa0 The Yankees don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to want to spend a lot of money, which is why I, and many other writers, think Zobrist makes sense.Haren and Colon are two pitchers who have experience and are veterans. Haren would not be a huge upgrade, but would come much cheaper than Colon. However, the Mets are likely willing to move Colon, who has experience pitching in the Big Apple.\xc2\xa0 Either pitcher would help the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 pitching staff.Tampa Bay Rays \xe2\x80\x93 Delmon YoungThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t much talk about possible moves for the Rays because they likely are going to stay pat.\xc2\xa0 They are going to hope Steven Souza Jr. can cut down on his strikeouts and keep hitting home runs.\xc2\xa0 They are going to hope their pitching staff can stay healthy and Chris Archer continues at his Cy Young-caliber pace.But, one intriguing name is Delmon Young. Young, the former Oriole, is a veteran hitter who would be a solid DH/OF for the Rays. He has played for Tampa in the past, and would bring a veteran presence to the lineup. Other than a move similar, I could see a minor trade for a bullpen piece; but I think as long as the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 pitching stays healthy, they are set to make a run where they are.Baltimore Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 Scott KazmirThe Orioles said on Tuesday they will not trade Chris Davis as long as they are in contention. While I do think that they either have to trade or release one of their outfielders and some people in their bullpen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is much value to be had there.If Dan Duquette wants to pull off a big trade, it is going to have to be trading an expiring contract and risking throwing in the towel for the rest of the season. There just isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough in the minor leagues to get a Johnny Cueto, or David Price, or Cole Hamels without really depleting the farm system, something I don\xe2\x80\x99t think happens.The team will likely make a few trades, with players like Brian Matusz, Wesley Wright, and Chris Parmelee all potential trade bait. But honestly, how attractive are those players. Not very. So, I think it might be the minor moves the Orioles make that could help them. In all honestly, they just need more consistency, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it is going to happen.Their biggest need does appear to be a starting pitcher, and a player like Kazmir would make sense for the Orioles. The question is whether they have enough to get him without trading top prospects, which they won\xe2\x80\x99t do.Toronto Blue Jays \xe2\x80\x93 Johnny Cueto, Cole Hamels, Jonathan Papelbon, Steve Cishek, Addison Reed\xc2\xa0 More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryName a pitcher on the trade block and the Jays are likely interested. Although their GM has said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to trade for a rental player, he also has said he is willing to deal major league talent.The Jays are thought to be one of the leaders in the chase for Cueto, and they\xc2\xa0have interest in Hamels. In needing a closer, Papelbon may be the best available, and of course has pitched in the AL East extensively.Cishek and Reed are cheaper options who are closers who could pitch for the Jays. The Jays are likely to make a move for pitching, so it will be fascinating to see who they go after.Boston Red Sox \xe2\x80\x93 Cole HamelsI think the Red Sox could make more moves, but they have been rumored to be interested in Hamels for months. I think he is the best fit in Boston, and Hamels is going to be moved. Could it be Cueto, yes. Could it be Colon, or someone else, yes.\xc2\xa0 But, the Red Sox are going to go get a starting pitcher, and I think Hamels is the best fit.What do you think? I only mentioned a few players, but there are many other options.Next: Looking at weaknesses in AL East teams ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles and the Weaknesses in the AL East', 'Next1 of 6Prev postUse your \xe2\x86\x90 \xe2\x86\x92 (arrows) to browseJun 14, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; New York Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius (18) slides past Baltimore Orioles catcher Caleb Joseph (36) to score during the second inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

And even though Brendan Ryan is about to come back, he likely wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hit much better, although his glove is better than Didi\xe2\x80\x99s.The rotation has also been a bit of a mess. Michael Pineda has been quite good. Masahiro Tanaka has also been pretty good, as long as he is healthy.C.C. Sabathia is 4-8 with a 5.47 ERA. And Joe Girardi has already said he won\xe2\x80\x99t take him out of the rotation. Nathan Eovaldi is 9-2 with a 4.50 ERA. But the average against is .308, which is very, very high for someone 9-2 and shows signs of regression.Ivan Nova is still getting healthy, but is not doing too bad.\xc2\xa0 But, can a team win with three starting pitchers? Maybe.

He was inserted in the top of the fifth as a pinch-hitter in place of Josh Donaldson, and immediately made a home run bid with a deep shot to left field. However he got under it just enough and it was recorded as a long fly ball out.Two innings later, Mike Trout drew a lead off walk and Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Brock Holt was immediately sent in as a pinch runner. Holt proceeded to steal second base, giving Machado an at-bat with a runner in scoring position. And Machado didn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint, sending an RBI-double to the gap in center field. He would move to second on Mark Teixeira\xe2\x80\x98s ground out, and later score on Prince Fielder\xe2\x80\x98s sac fly-RBI.The Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t just have token representation in this game, they had a decent number of representatives. Two of them (Machado and Britton) played big roles in the ending of the game. Adam Jones was also one of the big stars of the all-star festivities off the field, making various rounds on various networks talking baseball, Orioles, and other things. As a broadcasting major, I would submit that there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody more qualified to be a media personality when his playing days are done than Adam Jones!Cincinnati and Major League Baseball also put on one heck of a show prior to the game. Each franchise had their \xe2\x80\x9cFranchise Four\xe2\x80\x9d (four greatest players) announced on the pregame show, but the Reds\xe2\x80\x99 players (Johnny Bench, Barry Larkin, Joe Morgan, and yes the great Pete Rose) were announced to the crowd. I\xe2\x80\x99ve long been a proponent of reinstatement for Pete Rose, and speaking for myself seeing him announced to the crowd was a special moment.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Franchise Four players were Cal Ripken Jr, Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson, and Jim Palmer. When I voted I substituted Eddie Murray for Frank Robinson, however that\xe2\x80\x99s about as legitimate of a list that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to find league-wide. After that announcement, they brought out what baseball submitted as the four greatest living players: Johnny Bench, Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, and Sandy Koufax. That was followed up by Koufax throwing the first pitch of the game\xe2\x80\xa6to Bench.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

And that\xe2\x80\x99s partially because whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a baseball fan or not, the fabric of the game is ingrained in our hearts and minds. Some people say it\xe2\x80\x99s boring and some say they have no interest in the sport; yet it\xe2\x80\x99s still America\xe2\x80\x99s pastime.

The NL roster also included some local guys as well, such as Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Bryce Harper and Max Scherzer.\xc2\xa0Neither Scherzer, nor Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day of the Orioles were able to get into the game last night. Scherzer\xe2\x80\x99s reason was very simple; he started on Sunday (against the O\xe2\x80\x99s, of course). However in O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s case it was a bit different.First off, I like the fact that every team has to be represented on the roster. A lot of people do not, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I might even understand the point that it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair for a token representative should be added from a team that\xe2\x80\x99s presumably out of the race, replacing someone who might deserve it more. However baseball is America\xe2\x80\x99s pastime, and in order for it to ensure that it always remains as such, sometimes it has to take it\xe2\x80\x99s fate into it\xe2\x80\x99s own hands.\xc2\xa0Live Feed manny machadoBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenManny Machado mashes ball over Green Monster (Video) FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red Sox Call to the PenChris Sale reportedly to be suspended by MLB FanSidedBoston Red Sox Attempt to Hit Manny Machado--Again Call to the PenManny Machado rips the Red Sox for throwing behind him in NSFW rant FanSidedIn saying that, I mean that I\xe2\x80\x99ve always felt that every fan has the right to sit down to watch the all-star game and to thus have a member of his home team on the roster. Philadelphia has the worst record in baseball right now; yet fans in that market were still able to watch the game knowing that one of their own, Jonathan Papelbon, was on the roster (similar to O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Papelbon didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear in the game \xe2\x80\x93 and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to that in a moment). If you want baseball to thrive everywhere from the perspective of fan attention, those are just the sacrifices you have to make.In contrast, the NBA and NHL do not require every team to be represented. Some people would say that they\xe2\x80\x99re thus true all-star games because the players in the game are actually the most deserving in a sense (no token additions, in other words). But ask yourself \xe2\x80\x93 are those sports\xe2\x80\x99 all-star celebrations as popular as MLB\xe2\x80\x99s?\xc2\xa0This is not to say that a very bad team can\xe2\x80\x99t have an all-star, because they can. But if the team from your town is flailing in the wind and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have an all-star in the game, what incentive do you have to watch the game?The all-star game in any sport certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t everything, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something. The idea is that it showcases the best your sport has to offer. I would submit that it also keeps interest fresh, especially among young people. So that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing that MLB (and the NFL) requires each team to be represented. This is just my view \xe2\x80\x93 feel free to disagree.However there were also players, such as the aforementioned Jonathan Papelbon and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99day, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into the game at all. I would submit that if you\xe2\x80\x99re on the roster, you should play in the game (barring injury). Some folks might say that the game is just an exhibition (that decides home field advantage in the World Series), however athletes look at this as an honor. Furthermore to piggyback on what I said above, fans should be able to see their guy in the game and thus know he participated and added something in some way.I suppose that if I were a Phillies fans I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really be happy at knowing that my lone representative didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into the game. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly grant you that with the game now having stakes, managers might tend to take it a bit more seriously in the sense that they might not choose to change pitchers after every at-bat in the name of getting someone into the game. But again, this game is for the fans. It\xe2\x80\x99s not unreasonable for a fan to expect his team to be represented both on the roster and in the game.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerSome folks are going to disagree with this, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. This is just how I see things. One might argue,\xc2\xa0if it\xe2\x80\x99s an exhibition for the fans, why should a token player replace a true all star just so his team is represented?\xc2\xa0And that might well be a fair question to ask. But I would remind people that no system is perfect.In that vain, keep in mind that as a society we now try to find the perfect system in anything and everything. And for the most part there\xe2\x80\x99s always going to be a hole somewhere in every solution. Yes, a more deserving player might miss out on the festivities so that a Philadelphia Phillie or Milwaukee Brewer can be added to the roster. That\xe2\x80\x99s just how the ball bounces sometimes. But as I said, that keeps interest in markets that perhaps have a struggling team at that moment, and thus it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the game. And keep in mind\xe2\x80\xa6Baltimore was that market for a long period of time.Orioles update: As last night\xe2\x80\x99s all-star game was getting underway, the Orioles made a roster move. They designated Wesley Wright\xc2\xa0for assignment, removing him from the roster. If he clears waivers and isn\xe2\x80\x99t traded, he\xe2\x80\x99ll either have the option of accepting a minor league assignment with the O\xe2\x80\x99s or becoming a free agent.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado among others key in AL winMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

The International League (Triple-A Norfolk) and Eastern League (Double-A Bowie) are both on their All-Star Break, and both the High-A Frederick Keys and the Short Season-A Aberdeen Ironbirds.    The Triple-A and Double-A All-Star Games will both be taking place later tonight. A rundown of all of the Orioles minor league All-Stars this year, before the recap of the few games played yesterday. Orioles Triple-A All-Stars RHP Michael BowdenRHP Oliver DrakeC Steve ClevengerOF Dariel Alvarez - winner of the Triple-A Home Run Derby The Orioles will soon have a decision to make on Bowden, who has an opt out in his contract for, well, today. Bowden has a 1.71 ERA over 24 games, nine starts, for the Tides.    Orioles Double-A All-Stars RHP Terry DoyleRHP Mychal GivensC Rossmel PerezOF Quincy LatimoreOF Mike Yastrzemski    Hey, that\'s a nice number of All-Stars, although I suspect Givens, who was briefly in MLB this year, would take sitting in the Orioles bullpen over hanging out in Portland, ME for this game. All five of these guys are at least 24 years old, so this isn\'t the most prospect-y of lists, but they\'ve been doing great for Bowie this year. Congratulations to all of them for the achievement. Orioles High-A All-Stars Game played on June 23. California League All-Stars beat Carolina League All-Stars (which includes Frederick) 9-2.    RHP Mitch Horacek\xc2\xa03B Drew Dosch (since promoted to Bowie)SS Jeff Kemp2B Tucker Nathans (ditto) The Keys also had 1B Trey Mancini totally mashing. He would have surely been an All-Star except he earned his promotion to Bowie even before the All-Star game happened. Mancini has kept on raking there, too. Orioles Low-A All-Stars Game played on June 23. South Atlantic League North (including Delmarva players) beat South, 7-5.    RHP Garrett Cortright3B Jomar Reyes2B Stephen WilkersonOF Conor Bierfeldt (since promoted to Frederick) Wilkerson drove in two runs in the All-Star Game. Reyes, unfortunately, has not played since June 12 with a thumb injury. Reyes, only 18 and in a full season league, is the most prospect-y of all of these guys. Hopefully he\'ll be back soon. Now for your usually scheduled programming. Delmarva Shorebirds 18, Lexington (Royals) 6 The official scorer in this game must have been busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. The Shorebirds went up to the top rope on the Legends, blasting their starting pitcher for eight runs in less than four innings and wrecking some poor schmuck reliever for another seven runs in the eighth inning. That is savage. Young-ish (20) right fielder Ademar Rifaela had two hits and also two walks and scored three runs in the game. He is batting at a .240/.345/.389 clip since joining the Shorebirds. Starting pitcher John Means had himself a nice game - plenty easy with all that run support, right? John ""Ends Justify The"" Means gave up two runs on six hits in six innings of work. Means didn\'t walk anybody and struck out eight. Good job! GCL Red Sox 8, GCL Orioles 3 I don\'t usually dip down and talk about these guys in detail, but hey, there was nothing else going on Tuesday. The rookie-level O\'s actually out-hit their Red Sox counterparts 12-11, but the GCL Sox went 5-17 with RISP whereas the GCL O\'s only went 2-13.    2015 draftees Ryan McKenna, Ryan Mountcastle, and Jason Heinrich all had multi-hit games. Heinrich is now batting .400/.457/.475 in the 11 games he\'s played in this league. Mountcastle sports a .311/.348/.361 line. He committed his fifth error in just 16 games at shortstop; remember, he was pegged as a probable future outfielder. On the other hand, Manny Machado combined for 19 errors between Low-A and High-A in 2011 in only 94 games, and look where he is now!

Matt Wieters (along with Chris Davis, Bud Norris, and other pending free agents) aren\xe2\x80\x99t worth very much on the trade block this year. As pending free agents, another team would be acquiring him in a rental capacity in a sense \xe2\x80\x93 similar to what the Orioles did last year with Andrew Miller. So would a team be that willing to give up what the Orioles might expect in return for Wieters?To me, that answer is no.

Frederick jumped out to an early lead after taking Kansas City's 2014 first round pick Sean Manaea to the woodshed. Through 4 innings, the Keys had a 7-1 lead. Keys starter Luis Gonzalez was OK, allowing four runs (only 2 earned) in six innings pitched and leaving the game with an 8-4 lead. The bottom of the 7th, though, was ridiculous. The Blue Rocks sent 14 batters to the plate, and broke the game open by scoring ten runs. Dylan Rheault took the loss by allowing 5 earned runs in 0.0 innings pitched. Nik Nowottnick relieved him and allowed the other five, three of which were earned, and recorded only one out. Williams Louico finished off the inning and pitched the 8th, and two runs in the 9th weren't enough for the Keys. On the bright side, all ten position players to bat for the Keys had at least one hit - they actually outhit Wilmington 18 to 13 (four errors and nine Wilmington walks were the difference). Josh Hart was great, going 5-6 with two doubles and 3 RBIs. He scored two runs, one of which was a steal of home on a 1st-and-3rd double steal. Second baseman Jeff Kemp was 3-4 with a walk, and Chance Sisco was 2-5 on the day. Somehow, neither team hit a single home run in a 25-run ballgame. Frederick 5, Wilmington 2 (F/11) In the second game, Matt Taylor got the start for the Keys and allowed 2 earned runs in 4 innings (5 H, 3 K) before turning the game over to the bullpen. The relievers were fantastic- Jimmy Yacabonis, Donnie Hart and Cody Wheeler combined for 7 innings, 2 hits, zero earned runs, and 4 strikeouts.    Hits were hard to come by for the Keys against starter Sean Manaea (yes, he started both games since the first one began six days earlier). After playing to a 2-2 tie through ten innings, Frederick was finally able to break it open in the top of the 11th. Chance Sisco and Wynston Sawyer both walked, and my current favorite baseball name Tad Gold doubled them both in. Adrian Marin singled Gold home, and a quick inning from Wheeler gave Frederick a 5-2 victory. Sisco and Marin had two hits apiece, out of only seven total for the Keys.    Delmarva 11, Lexington (Royals) 3 This was an easy win for the Shorebirds. All three pitchers were effective: starter Lucas Long (3 IP, 1 ER, 3 H, 0 BB, 1 K), Dariel Delgado \xc2\xa0(5 IP, 1 ER, 3 H, 1 BB, 3 K), and Max Schuh (1 IP, 0 ER, 1 H, 2 K). Meanwhile, Delmarva teed off on Legends pitching to the tune of 15 hits, 6 walks, and eleven runs. Eight starters had at least one hit for the Shorebirds. Shortstop Stephen Wilkerson was 2-2 with two walks, first baseman Logan Uxa was 3-5 with a double, and centerfielder TJ Olesczuk was 3-5 with a double. Catcher Yermin Mercedes had a big day with a 2-run homer in the 4th and an RBI double as well.    Aberdeen 5, Hudson Valley (Rays) 1 Just like Delmarva, Aberdeen had an easy day thanks to a good team pitching performance. Tanner Scott was dominant, striking out 7 and allowing only one baserunner in three innings. This year's 3rd round pick, Garrett Cleavinger, replaced him and threw a perfect inning - he's yet to allow a hit or a run in 4 innings pitched so far as a pro. Elias Pinales picked up the win, allowing the game's only run over three innings, and 2015 30th round pick Andrew Elliott threw a perfect two frames to close out the game. In total, Aberdeen pitching allowed only 5 hits and no walks. On the offensive side, right fielder and 2015 16th round pick Mike Odenwaelder was the star of the day, going 3-3 with a walk and a double. Designated hitter Randolph Gassaway and shortstop Ricardo Adujar both went 2-4. First rounder D.J. Stewart played left field and went 0-3. He's struggling so far in his very young pro career, batting .150 on the season for Aberdeen. The full scoreboard is available\xc2\xa0here if you want to check out the GCL/DSL action.

Washington\xe2\x80\x99s game with Los Angeles was well behind the curve in the sense that they were only in the fourth inning as opposed to almost being finished. Before the night was over, the game had featured two delays as a result of lights going out in the ballpark. The game was suspended after the third time, and will be completed starting at 2 PM this afternoon.Based on the media accounts I\xe2\x80\x99ve read about the situation, it sounded somewhat surreal. Needless to say it was a bizzare type of delay, and one that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t normally occur in baseball. However in reality it\xe2\x80\x99s not too different from an actual rain delay, which is something that ball players are used to in a sense. But with this in mind, are there changes that the league could make in the rules governing delays and suspensions?\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireAs we know, suspended games are still games \xe2\x80\x93 and one game at that. In situations like this the league doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even make the statistics final until the game is completed \xe2\x80\x93 in a retroactive manner. But with that said we also know the rules governing games, specifically with regard to player substitutions and so forth. Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve exited a game, you\xe2\x80\x99re out. This is true in all circumstances, including suspended and delayed games.But in reality should that be the case? One dilema that we often see is managers trying to decide whether to send their starter back into the game after a delay. And understandably it\xe2\x80\x99s a heck of a dilema given the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s poignantly not good for a pitcher to stop, start, and then stop again. At the end of the day in these situations, managers will almost always stay on the side of caution.But that burns through pitchers as well. And the same can be true of guys on the bench. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say it\xe2\x80\x99s a tie game in the last of the fifth and rain\xe2\x80\x99s coming. The hometown manager knows this, and when someone hits a double that player gets lifted for a pinch runner that can really fly. At the end of the day, the game goes into a rain delay.Once the delay is over (or after it\xe2\x80\x99s resumed following it\xe2\x80\x99s suspension), the hitter that was lifted is out of the game. However in my personal view, this gives a competitive advantage to the opposing team. So would it not be fair to alter the rules so that players could re-enter a game if they were lifted before a delay or game suspension?\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsSome people are going to say that\xe2\x80\x99s why managers need to weigh all options when making in-game moves. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a very valid point. One of the beauties of baseball to me is that you can\xe2\x80\x99t freely substitute players in and out. Once a guy\xe2\x80\x99s taken out of the game, he\xe2\x80\x99s out for the remainder of the game. It forces managers to think strategically, as opposed to coaches in football or basketball who can just insert and remove players at will.But I would submit that these incidents involving delays and suspensions are fairly extraordinary events. The presumption is that nine innings will be played uninterrupted. On the stat sheet in fact it goes down as nine innings uninterrupted. In no way am I thinking that baseball should ever do away with players totally being out of games once they\xe2\x80\x99re lifted. I think that over-simplifies the game, and it removes part of it\xe2\x80\x99s charm. But giving managers the liberty to re-insert players who may have been lifted\xc2\xa0prior to the delay or suspension would be a very fair tool to offer.Incidentally, there already is some variation of the rules with regard to players specifically in suspended games. In the case of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s game with LA, it\xe2\x80\x99s being completed today (the next day) so odds are this won\xe2\x80\x99t play a role. However there are plenty of games which aren\xe2\x80\x99t completed for some time, including one between the Orioles and New York circa 2007 (which was completed a month later).If a player is on the roster when a game is resumed who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the roster when the game started, he is in fact eligible to play. So you could have scenarios where a player has been traded between those two teams in the interim, and he could end up on both sides of the box score. Another statistical oddity could end up being that a prospect who was called up to the big leagues since the game was suspended could end up making his big league debut and recording his \xe2\x80\x9cfirst big league hit\xe2\x80\x9d well after (or before) he actually did. As I said, the stats are retroactive to the original date of the game.At the end of the day, offering managers just a bit of flexibility in the rules in these situations wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a bad thing. Whether or not that ever happens is another story; I just think it would be something that would better the game.Next: Baltimore Orioles, Ubaldo Jimenez start with a new beginningMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

In last night\xe2\x80\x99s game we also saw this in the beginning from Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s David Price, who put several Orioles out with sweeping curve balls low and away.If you look back on several poor starts by other Oriole starters this year, you\xe2\x80\x99llCourtesy\xc2\xa0Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sportsnotice that opposing teams literally forced the pitcher to utilize their fastball. And by that I mean on almost every pitch. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you neutralize a pitcher who\xe2\x80\x99s got a great fastball; the only chance he has is to strike the hitter out everytime given the fact that the hitter already knows what\xe2\x80\x99s coming.But if a pitcher is able to mix in a change up or curve ball like Tillman was doing last night, he\xe2\x80\x99s really going to find himself in business.

When hitters are allowed to force pitchers to throw their fastball and only their fastball, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be on their toes.So the point is to take it easy in a sense.

Schoop has now appeared in 160.Clearly Machado has broken through this year to become, as hoped, one of the very best players in the sport. He is currently the number five ranking player in all of baseball in terms of the WAR statistic (5.2) \xe2\x80\x93 ahead of even such as Max Scherzer and Josh Donaldson.So, could Schoop be on the verge of a similar breakthrough? My own opinion on this is that if he is not ready to do so right now, that time is not terribly far away. He is going to be a streaky player, just like most others on the Orioles. But I believe Schoop has greater talent than almost all of the others who are up and down in performance to be able to learn the necessary adjustments as his experience grows.This much is for sure: the mechanics of his swing are about as good as anyone, anywhere. He snaps the head of the bat on the ball with great timing and authority, and the ball often seems to explode off the lumber.He will be a free-swinger, perhaps not quite as much as Adam Jones, but enough to tally some strikeouts. But even with this, he has so far this year cut it down to about 20%, dropping from 25%.Together with Machado, this is a great tandem for Orioles fans to enjoy over at least the next handful of years.Next: Tillman shows dominance ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles and Runners in Scoring Position', 'The Baltimore Orioles busted out of a team-wide slump with runners in scoring position on Sunday, en route to a 9-3 victory over the Detroit Tigers.

The Orioles have been rumored to be interested in, or are scouting, players like Cole Hamels, Johnny Cueto, Carlos Gomez, Justin Upton, and Jay Bruce.Do you think any of these are coming to the O\xe2\x80\x99s? If so, who are you trading? Kevin Gausman? Hunter Harvey?One baseball writer says the Orioles, with the injuries to Hunter Harvey and Dylan Bundy, have the worst farm system in baseball. I\xe2\x80\x99d say it is hard to disagree with that.Sure, the Orioles have been winning across their minor league affiliates this year. But the talent is not the same as what other organizations have. Especially when it comes to position players.Bundy at this point is a high draft choice who may never make it anywhere, sadly. Gausman is unproven, as is Harvey, who has also dealt with injury issues.Tyler Wilson and Mike Wright are not great trade chips.That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t have some players that will likely be good major leaguers. Players like Mike Yastrzemski, Trey Mancini, Josh Hart, Oliver Drake, Zach Davies, Dariel Alvarez, Mychal Givens and more.But, I also believe the Orioles value some of the players more than other teams do. The Orioles clearly are getting things done, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the same way that some other major league teams are doing it.I think the O\xe2\x80\x99s will make at least a few moves at the deadline. On Wednesday, they have to make a move to get Kevin Gausman in the rotation. My guess is that either Ryan Flaherty will be sent down, since he has options, or that Chris Parmelee will be designated for assignment.I also think that a trade out of the bullpen could be coming. Maybe Brian Matusz, maybe Tommy Hunter.However, there is precedent to the Orioles making a significant deal around the deadline recently. In 2011, Koji Uehara was traded to the Texas Rangers for Tommy Hunter and Chris Davis. They also traded Mike Gonzalez to the Rangers after the non-waiver deadline in August, getting Pedro Strop in return.

They also waited until after the non-waiver deadline and acquired Joe Saunders from the Arizona Diamondbacks for Matt Lindstrom. Saunders would go on to be one of the team\xe2\x80\x99s starters in the playoffs, including starting the first ever AL Wild Card game.In 2013, the Orioles made deadline deals for pitching, bringing in Bud Norris for L.J. Hoes, Josh Hader and a competitive pick. They also traded Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop for Scott Feldman and Steve Clevenger. Both of those trades don\xe2\x80\x99t look very good at this point, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t second guess either of them.The Birds also traded Nick Delmonico to the Milwaukee Brewers for Francisco Rodriguez, who did not fill the closer role the way the team expected.Xavier Avery was also traded at the end of August for Michael Morse. That didn\xe2\x80\x99t go well either.In 2014, the team traded Eduardo Rodriguez to the Boston Red Sox for Andrew Miller at the last second of the trade deadline. This move paid big dividends, as Miller was absolutely spectacular down the stretch.Two other deals were made at the end of August, trading Mark Blackmar and Miguel Chalas to the Chicago White Sox for Alejandro De Aza. Also, the O\xe2\x80\x99s traded Ivan De Jesus and Jemile Weeks to the Boston Red Sox for Michael Almanzar and Kelly Johnson.Look back at these deals. Of the minor leaguers the O\xe2\x80\x99s traded, only Rodriguez has really had an impact on the major leaguers. However, out of all the players traded for only Chris Davis, Tommy Hunter and Bud Norris are in the major leagues for the Birds.The last point I want to make is the moves made in the even years, 2012 and 2014, in hindsight look much better than those made in odd years.Maybe based on that alone, the Orioles should stay put at the trade deadline this year.Next: The O's and RISPMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles vs. Yankees: Series Preview - Camden Chat', "" The Story So Far: So on one hand, the Orioles success in Detroit has put them one game over .500 and into second place in the division. On the other hand, they're still four games back of the Yankees. Even a sweep this week would still leave them a game behind. Winning two of three would leave them three games back. Still, gaining some ground is better than losing it, and with the Blue Jays and Rays sitting only 0.5 a game behind the Orioles, they can't afford any more losses.    The Yankees have won six of their last ten games and may have spent more time atop the division standings than anyone else this season. They started off the second half by winning two of three from the Mariners. You could argue they've been a little lucky this season, outperforming their pythagorean expectation by two games, but that's not a huge difference. Despite some issues with the starting pitching they've been playing well, getting some unexpected offensive performances from their aging sluggers. You'd like to think that won't continue, but who knows. The last time these two teams faced, the Orioles won two of three in Baltimore. But the last time the Birds were in the Bronx, they lost three of four. What will this month bring? Pitching Matchups: Tuesday: Wei-Yin Chen vs. Nathan Eovaldi     2015     W/L   IP   ERA+   FIP   WHIP   SO/W     Chen   4-5   110.0   139   4.19   1.091   3.60     Eovaldi   9-2   98.0   87   3.53   1.520   2.73        If Chen's July continues like it has so far, O's fans shouldn't have much to worry about on Tuesday night. His ERA at the end of June was 2.90 and it's actually gone down in three starts this month. Maybe the best part about Chen is his ability to pitch deep into games. He consistently pitches seven or eight innings, which is nice in a rotation that doesn't feature many other players that can do that on a regular basis. In two games against the Yankees this season, he's pitched 13 innings and given up three earned runs. One of those starts was at Yankee Stadium, and that game was particularly good - giving up one earned run while striking out seven and walking one. His ERA over 34+ innings at Yankee Stadium isn't great, but he's only given up three home runs. Against a lefty-team that relies on power, that's a good sign.    Nathan Eovaldi somehow has nine wins - he should not have nine wins. He's pitched against the O's twice this season. Once in April where gave up two runs in eight hits in five innings, and once in May where he gave up three runs and six hits in 5.2 innings. Those are good records that should give the O's lineup confidence. What's more is that his platoon this season is terrible. Righties hit for an OPS of .668, but lefties hit .875. In a ballpark that favors lefties, expect to see Travis Snider in left and Chris Parmelee at first. Wednesday: Kevin Gausman vs. Ivan Nova     2015     W/L   IP   ERA+   FIP   WHIP   SO/W     Gausman   1-1   27.0   78   3.87   1.296   2.78     Nova   1-3   23.2   115   4.58   1.352   1.71        So who has to leave to make room for Gausman? Reports are that Buck doesn't want to lose another pitcher, but they've also discarded a fair share of position players too. Could Ryan Flaherty be optioned to avoid another DFA? Has Parmelee run his course? When will they have a home edition of Dan Duquette Roster Roulette? Even though Gausman's last start in the bigs wasn't great, that minor league start over the break wasn't bad. His record against the Yankees is pretty good - in 27.2 innings, he's got a 2.28 ERA and a 5.20 SO/W. Brett Gardener has a .300 BA against him in 10 PAs, which is the most on the Yankees lineup. Nova is making his return from Tommy John surgery last season. He's pitched in four games this season and they've all been increasingly bad. His one win was against the Phillies. Orioles batters have seen plenty of him. Davis is hitting .333 with 3 HRs in 24 ABs. That's topped though by Matt Wieters, who's hitting .355 with 4 HRs in 31 ABs. Snider, Adam Jones, and J.J. Hardy all have homers against him as well. Thursday: Ubaldo Jimenez vs. Masahiro Tanaka     2015     W/L   IP   ERA+   FIP   WHIP   SO/W     Jimenez   7-5   104.0   117   3.49   1.279   3.22     Tanaka   6-3   74.0   107   3.77   1.027   4.93        Jimenez followed up three great starts with a bad one last week in Detroit. That's going to happen - but he's having such a good year, I think this is good news because its more likely than not that this next start will be a good one. His lone start against the Yankees this season was OK - of course, the Orioles also scored 11 runs that game, so how good did he need to be? The Yankees lineup has had mixed success against Jimenez. Carlos Beltran has probably played the best - .500 BA and 2 HRs in 12 ABs. The Orioles haven't seen Tanaka yet this season, which has been slightly short for him since he didn't come back until after the season started from an elbow injury. They did see him last year though, and both games resulted in a loss for the Yankees. The thing I remember most about those games was Jonathan Schoop and how he hit a home run against Tanaka in both games. In fact, only three other players have hit more than one home run (all tied at 2) against Tanaka - Kyle Seager, Mike Napoli, and J.D Martinez. That's good company. Think he'll be in the lineup? Think you'll hear others talk about Schoop's two homers against Tanaka? Other Notes: - It's probably hard to stress how important this series is to the Orioles. Winning two of three against the Tigers was a good way to start off the 2nd half, but they need to build on that. These teams don't play again until September, and who knows what these two teams will look like by then. - I mentioned above how this is a lefty-hitting lineup. Alex Rodriguez is the only regular player in their lineup that isn't a lefty or switch hitter. Of course, Didi Gregorius is the only regular player under the age of 30 and he's also their worst hitter. How is this team winning again? - Unlike the last time these two teams played, Andrew Miller is not on the DL - so expect to hear a lot about how well he played for the Orioles last season, how they didn't re-sign him, etc. Him and Dellin Betances make an incredible bullpen duo, but the O's 'pen still outranks them in ERA (2.84 vs. 3.36).    - Next time someone tells you how weak the AL East is this season, you may want to remind them three of the top five teams in OPS+ are in that division. The Yankees rank slightly ahead of the Orioles offensively, but that doesn't mean the Orioles position is a bad one. (The Blue Jays are the third team) - Since 2012, the Orioles are 36-30 against the Yankees, including 16-16 on the road. - Monkey off their back, chip off their shoulder, weight lifted - call it what you will, but in Sunday's game against the Tigers the Orioles were 6 for 10 with runners in scoring position. That was their best performance in that stat in - well, in a while. We can stop taking about it now, right? Prediction: Call me a homer if you want, but I like the matchup the Orioles have in every one of these games. The Orioles have had success against all these pitchers for the Yankees, and the Orioles are putting up their best three guys. The bullpen is rested after that day off and I think they're due some wins in New York. I'm going bold - look for the sweep.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Crucial AL East battle awaits Orioles against first place ...', ' The Orioles enter this series against the Yankees four games back of the lead in the American League East. Sweep and they\'re almost back in the top spot. Get swept and we\'ll be left wondering who can get traded away before the trade deadline and what kind of return the Orioles might get for those players.    How about those Yankees, though? They\'re in first place! What\'s that about? They\'re supposed to be bad and old! Well, I\'ve pretty much thought that every year for the last three years, including the 2012 season when they beat the O\'s in a closely-contested ALDS. It hasn\'t come true yet, much to my chagrin. Thankfully I don\'t have to do much thinking about the Yankees, and I can check in with my counterpart over at\xc2\xa0Pinstripe Alley, Tanya Bondurant, to provide you with some thoughts on this year\'s incarnation of Satan\'s chosen warriors. If you\'d like to read my thoughts on the Orioles for this series, you can read my answers to some questions\xc2\xa0over on PSA. ** Mark: Everybody, myself included, has been sitting around waiting for the Yankees to collapse from the weight of their own old-ness - but the three most valuable Yankees are Brett Gardner (31), Mark Teixeira (35), and Alex Rodriguez (39). Do you think that\'s going to last the rest of the season? Tanya: The production out of Rodriguez and Teixeira has been pretty surprising, but it also makes sense. Rodriguez had the benefit of giving his body a year off and hasn\'t been forced into the field on a regular basis. Teixeira seems to have finally been able to recover from his wrist injury, which we know can take a while. I didn\'t think it could last at the beginning but now I\'m a believer.    Gardner is so underrated but we\'ve known he\'s good for a while now. The power has started to show up more in the last two seasons and he\'s cemented himself as a pretty good leadoff hitter forced to bat second. Having two speedy table setters at the top of the lineup has really been incredibly valuable. I don\'t see his production slacking off either.    Mark: We\'re now nearly ten months into the After Jeter era. Coincidentally, the post-Jeter shortstop, Didi Gregorius, is the lone regular under the age of 30. Have you noticed a difference in the up the middle defense with Didi instead of Jeets? Tanya: The difference in Gregorius\' defense and Jeter\'s defense is pretty much night and day. It\'s really refreshing to see a shortstop who can make plays more than two steps to his left or right after seeing pretty much every other team have that when we didn\'t for the last few seasons. Didi got off to a rough start but he\'s really come around both in the field and at the plate. His defense is really impressive and can be a real treat to watch at times. Mark: Speaking of the middle infield... what in the world would possess the Yankees to have Stephen Drew with 80 games played and no end in sight despite a .181/.255/.369 batting line? Tanya: I think the end may actually be in sight for Drew, and thank goodness for that. The Yankees cut Brian Roberts at the trade deadline last year and I expect that Drew will be, at the very least, moved to the bench once July 31st passes. Brendan Ryan\'s time on the team has to be ticking, serving the same purpose as Drew as a no-hit, all-glove middle infielder. The team clearly prefers Drew and I only think he\'s still around on the off chance that the Yankees need to use Rob Refsnyder for a no-brainer trade before the deadline.    I just can\'t imagine their goodwill towards Drew will extend into August. They may very well keep him around as a bench player who can play shortstop, second base, and third base with a little pop in his bat that is made for Yankee Stadium, but I think his days as a starter on a team that is leading the division are certainly numbered. Mark: Just from looking at the stat lines, it seems like you\'ve basically got a back of the bullpen trio to dominate all comers. I don\'t think many would be surprised by Andrew Miller\'s or Dellin Betances\'s performance, but Chasen Shreve is not someone I\'d expect to encounter in the sub-2.00 ERA, sub-1.00 WHIP category. Where did this guy come from, and is he really that good? Tanya: Shreve was supposed to be ""the other guy"" in the Manny Banuelos/David Carpenter trade with Atlanta this offseason, but he turned out to be the prize return. Carpenter never put it together in New York and was ultimately DFA\'d while Shreve has become a trusted reliever capable of getting out of difficult situations in the later innings of close games. He\'s been everything anyone could have hoped for, especially as the sort of add on player of the trade. Being a lefty that doesn\'t allow right-handers to wreck him is also very helpful. As to whether or not he\'s really that good, I\'d say that it\'s pretty close. He may not be as dominant as he has been so far this season forever, but his stuff is good and he has the ability to be a very strong bullpen piece for quite a while.    Mark: One of the starting pitchers set to face the O\'s in this series is Ivan Nova, who hasn\'t been back very long from Tommy John surgery. How\'s he looked in his big league action since the surgery? Tanya: Even a healthy Nova was maddeningly inconsistent, and the recovering from Tommy John Nova isn\'t really different. I think there is some reason to expect there to be rust when a guy hasn\'t pitched in games in over a year and that\'s certainly been evident in his return. Should the Yankees acquire a starter before the deadline I think Nova is the one who gets booted to the bullpen, even despite CC Sabathia\'s ugly season so far. When Nova goes out there and dominates you kind of shake your head knowingly, but you also do the same thing when he goes out there and surrenders 12 hits in 5 innings, unfortunately. ** So there you have it on the currently first place Yankees.

In this case, someone is getting voluntold to the disabled list. Yet isn\'t the DL better than the great DFA in the sky? Someone must step forward, surely.    And indeed, someone did. The Orioles recalled Kevin Gausman so that he could start Wednesday night\'s game.

Maybe it\'s why he\'s not good this year, just like it was the reason offered why Chris Davis wasn\'t good last year. Obliques of baseball players are always getting strained.

Parmelee has a .396 OPS in July, for crying out loud. This is not really a surprising outcome.

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsWhen pitching coach Leo Mazzone was with the Baltimore Orioles some years ago, he would speak of attempting to get starters to think in terms of getting 20 outs \xe2\x80\x93 going 6 and 2/3 innings. If done with some consistency, this saves the bullpen from overuse and allows for a couple of dominant relievers to essentially shut down the opposition from that point forward.Particularly in the 2014 season, we saw where teams with two, or even three, highly effective relievers were able to contribute mightily toward a team\xe2\x80\x99s success. We might particularly point to the Royals in this regard, and it is fair to include the Orioles in that discussion. I believe this line of thinking and team construction is more than a current fad, rather it is a timeless way of constructing a roster \xe2\x80\x93 weighing heavily also upon the distribution of available dollars.And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve written a handful of times since the end of last season, I would have rather seen the Orioles spend whatever it took to keep Andrew Miller than Nelson Cruz or Nick Markakis \xe2\x80\x93 especially if we are talking about four-year deals and not just 2015.OK, yes, I can hear some of you screaming one of two things, or maybe even both!\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cBut the Orioles did not spend to keep even one of those three!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Or, \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t have Miller, because if you can\xe2\x80\x99t score any more than two runs in your first 20 outs of the game, it is irrelevant as to who you have in the bullpen most nights.\xe2\x80\x9dThese things are true. But my point is not to say that the Orioles would be five games ahead of the Yankees instead of five games behind if only they had kept Miller. The back end of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 relief corps is arguably nearly as good as what the Yankees have going on with Dellin Betances and Miller. And frankly, this Orioles roster should be scoring more runs than they are, even without whatever Cruz and Markakis would have brought to it. They should be good enough to be among the best in the league. They are not getting it done. Duquette and Angeles can\xe2\x80\x99t hit the ball for them.

There is a whole lot of daylight between saying the Orioles ""appear to be willing to talk about"" Gausman and the Orioles actually trading Gausman in any kind of deal. The first barrier to a move of that sort is that it doesn\'t make any sense whatsoever. If you trade Gausman, who\'s your starting pitcher? Bud Norris back into the rotation? Mike Wright or Tyler Wilson? You have not improved the team in that way. OK, so maybe it would be a trade for a starter... Cole Hamels? Johnny Cueto? It still sounds crazy even if you think about it for those guys, particularly Cueto, who\'s just a two-month rental. Hamels, at least, is signed through 2018 - but at a cost of $23.5 million per year and his 2015 season just so happens to have the worst ERA he\'s posted since 2009. Oh, and by the way, in 31 career interleague starts, he has a 4.71 ERA.    There are players out there who could make the Orioles a better team, and the prospect of them doing nothing at the deadline and slipping out of the race as these weak spots are exposed is frustrating. But there\'s always something out there that makes the idea of doing nothing a whole lot more palatable - and trading Gausman is definitely one of those things. It\'s not worth the panic. This rumor doesn\'t mean the Orioles are out there trying to trade Gausman to anybody, and even if it did, probably nothing will happen.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

When the Orioles are losing, it is .213; but when the O\xe2\x80\x99s are ahead by four or more runs, he is batting .321.\xc2\xa0 This car needs a new clutch.I continue to believe the Orioles would be best served to let Nolan Reimold play left field consistently and bat in the second spot.

The reasons are those I\xe2\x80\x99ve rehearsed a dozen times in this blog, but the consistent playing time and his sneaky fast speed would help the Orioles at the top of the lineup.

Down the road in Frederick, the Keys have won two straight games from their Carolina League rivals, Potomac Nationals. The Keys defeated Potomac 3-1 last night at Pfitzner Stadium in Woodbridge, VA.First off it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting how minor league baseball has evolved a bit. Growing up in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s and \xe2\x80\x9990\xe2\x80\x99s, my Dad didn\xe2\x80\x99t take us to very many minor league baseball games. We had the Keys and the Alexandria Dukes (in Alexandria, VA), who later moved down the pike and became the Prince William Cannons \xe2\x80\x93 now the Potomac Nationals.

Rebilas-USA TODAY SportsHowever at that time the Keys (and later the Bowie Baysox) were a bit of an anamoly. Very few big league clubs had farm teams within striking distance of the big league club. Heck the Dukes/Cannons/Nationals revolved around; at varying points they were part of the ChiSox and Pirates\xe2\x80\x99 farm systems. However now it seems that there\xe2\x80\x99s more of an emphasis on having your farm teams close by, which especially helps a team like the Orioles who fully utilizes it\xe2\x80\x99s 40-man roster.The Keys\xe2\x80\x99 left fielder Jay Gonzalez is a fairly solid prospect, going 1-for-5 in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game. The Keys also got two hits (including a home run) out of Chance Sisco, their catcher. The game went to the ninth inning tied at one, but Frederick scored on a wild pitch by the Potomac pitcher, and later in the inning Tanner Witt squeezed a run home on a sac bunt. For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth the Washington Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 top pitching prospect, Lucas Giolito, started the game for Potomac, pitching six innings. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s third baseman, Anthony Rendon, was also guarding the hot corner for Potomac \xe2\x80\x93 in a rehab assignment.Keep in mind that the Keys are Class A ball; so these prospects might not see the field at Oriole Park at Camden Yards for some time. You do have some prospects (Manny Machado, for instance) who are fast tracked to the big leagues. But for most of these guys it takes some time \xe2\x80\x93 if they make it at all. Incidentally while this was technically a road game for the Keys, I\xe2\x80\x99d highly recommend making the trek out to Harry Grove Stadium in Frederick if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been.

Perhaps he meant it at the time. Perhaps not. Perhaps the team getting swept in New York was an occasion to reconsider his position. Today\'s rumor,\xc2\xa0floated by FOX\'s Jon Morosi, is that the Orioles are giving ""serious consideration"" to being sellers at the deadline.    Remember, always, the first law of baseball rumors: Probably nothing will happen. That\'s still true even if it\'s a rumor that may align with your personal opinion. Don\'t be more likely to believe something just because it matches what you already think! But it is certainly the case that after watching the Orioles get swept in New York, with little offense to be found, selling looks more tempting as a way to get better for the future. Morosi names Chris Davis and Matt Wieters as the possible trade chips if the team decides to sell. It would be sad to see either one go, though particularly in the case of Wieters, it might be for the best. Wieters\' recent performance has not been inspiring and getting something for him now rather than worrying about whether or not he\'ll be worth the qualifying offer or whether or not he might take it could be the ideal scenario for the team. As for Davis, well, you do have to give up something to get something. In trading either of these two players, the O\'s would probably get at least a little bit of salary relief that they could store for next year, or, if they are willing to pay some salary they might get better prospects from some other team.    The Thursday trade between the Astros and Athletics that sent Scott Kazmir to Houston for a couple of minor leaguers is probably the best indication of what any of the Orioles\' pending free agents might fetch in trade. Kazmir, a strong 2015 performer who is a pending free agent, was traded for a pair of fairly recent draftees in High-A - one possible back-end starter but probable reliever, and one bat-first catcher. The Orioles will need to consider, is that kind of return better than getting a shot in the early-30s for a compensation pick? Picks in that range come with about $1.8 million in slot money, which isn\'t chump change. It also gives the Orioles some freedom to potentially sign a qualifying offer free agent without feeling like they\'re burning up their entire draft. Grabbing your first pick at like 35 isn\'t ideal, but it\'s better than waiting until the 50s. Better yet, maybe they can go ahead and win the next six games and forget all of this potential seller business.

Most of us didn\'t choose it, of course. It chose us. More\'s the pity. Every game we watch a group of mostly millionaires, and we are heavily emotionally invested in the outcome of a contest over which we can exert no control whatsoever. Many games, they will lose. In some years, most games, they will lose. And even in the good years, it\'s probably going to end in heartbreak, leaving the distant dream of maybe next year.    Then you get to next year, and it\'s this. The 2015 Orioles are not a bad baseball team, but they are a baseball team that is, at present, playing very badly. They cannot score runs in sufficient quantities to save their lives, or, put in a less hyperbolic way, their season. They\'re a strikeout-prone group of hackers who can occasionally demonstrate some power but when they\'re not getting the power, what you instead get is these awful games where they score one runs, or two runs, or none. And you look at the lineup afterwards and you see things like the first baseman Chris Parmelee batting ninth and it\'s like, of course that happened. Of course they lost. You might lose in part because of bad luck - broken bat bloopers that just die in the right place on the diamond, the other team\'s defense making a play that\'s maybe made 10% of the time - but when your first baseman bats ninth and your offense sucks, well, of course it does. That\'s a structural deficiency built into the team at this time.

That\'s the Orioles right now. This is a guy who is on the team. They went out of their way to trade for him, sending a couple of distant-from-the-majors minor league lefties to the Pirates in order to acquire Travis Snider\'s services. I\'m sure they had their reasons. They probably weren\'t even bad reasons. That\'s the case with many of the Orioles\' offseason moves, including many of the non-signings that the ""Peter Angelos is cheap!"" crowd harps on even though they would have been terrible signings. But they made them and this is how they\'re turning out, and maybe it\'s not entirely their fault; Rays starter Chris Archer is a good pitcher and he strikes out like one hojillion dudes. That\'s what happens. So of course they struck out 14 times tonight. It may well have been a miracle they got the one run, given the state of their offense in July... and it was almost enough, even so. It was very nearly enough.    The Orioles got that one run on a fluky play in the fourth inning. Chris Davis doubled down the right field line, a ball that Rays first baseman James Loney, a solid fielder, essentially punched into the Rays bullpen area. The deflection provided enough extra time for Manny Machado to speed around from first base on the play and score thanks to a rushed throw home. Davis was in scoring position thanks to that double, and we know what that means. The stat that the pre-game show on MASN quoted was, I believe, that the Orioles were 17-126 with RISP in the month of July. That is, unsurprisingly, the worst number in the league. But right after Davis got on second base, the Orioles got a hit with RISP! J.J. Hardy hit a single! Hooray! ...except it was a hard hit ball that bounced right to one of the Rays outfielders and so the Orioles did not get a run off their lone hit with RISP in the game. They went 1-7 total on the night. Snider, starring in the above GIF, snuffed out that rally promptly with a ground ball double play where he tried valiantly to make it to first base despite the refrigerator strapped to his back. He was short by a step.    And even so they almost won. They carried a 1-0 lead into the eighth inning. Chris Tillman looked like the Tillman of last year for the second straight start. Maybe that\'s because he was facing the Rays offense, who are not good. Maybe he improved something over the All-Star Break. But he was tiring and so the Orioles brought in Darren O\'Day, the All-Star who has generally locked down the eighth inning all season. We\'ve seen him work his way out of multiple bases-loaded, nobody-out jams this year, and this was a measly man on first with nobody out. The runner stole second, but O\'Day got two easy outs and all he had to do was set down John Jaso to move the O\'s into the ninth, where All-Star closer Zach Britton could take over and do his thing. Yet even O\'Day has a weakness, and that weakness is left-handed hitting. They sport a .786 OPS against him. Jaso is a lefty, one who is actually kind of inexplicably batting .300/.400/.500. Should manager Buck Showalter have been on top of this and gone to Britton for a four-out save? Maybe, but he didn\'t. Most of the time sticking with O\'Day works. This time it did not. Three runs scored before all was said and done. It almost doesn\'t even matter how, just like it doesn\'t matter that this was the first loss suffered by either O\'Day or Britton all year, nor does it matter that, before this game, the Orioles were 39-0 in games where they led after seven innings. The Orioles needed a win tonight, really badly needed a win to stave off the crescendo of rumors about whether or not they will or should be trade deadline sellers (never mind that Showalter flatly denied any such thing before the game). What the Orioles got instead was the kind of long fart where you desperately try to hold it in because you know it\'s going to be a mess. Eventually you can\'t hold it in any more and you have to change your pants afterwards and you hope nobody notices. I\'ve got some bad news. Everybody noticed.     ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

And after seven frames on Friday night, the O\xe2\x80\x99s were winning 1-0.Chris Tillman was pitching a beautiful game, having only given up two hits, with two walks and a hit batsman. He had only thrown 85 pitches.Leading off the bottom of the eighth for the Rays was Kevin Kiermaier, and Tillman walked him on a full count, putting the tying run on first base. And out comes Buck Showalter, calling for Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day to enter the game.

In this case, there was no way Buck was going to allow Tillman to put another runner on base and become the loser. I will bet anything that Showalter would have permitted Tillman to face another batter if the score was 2-0 instead of 1-0.Of course, there is every reason to have confidence in Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, who has truly been great over the past month or so. But after getting an out, O\xe2\x80\x99Day simply did not hold Kiermaier closely enough on first base, and the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 center fielder stole second base. There he was for John Jaso to drive the first pitch he saw from O\xe2\x80\x99Day into center for an RBI single. The inning continued and featured a fluke hit by Evan Longoria on a broken bat, and before it was over, the score was 3-1 \xe2\x80\xa6 the final.You can say that it was again some bad luck that hurt the Orioles in that eighth inning. But, when a team only scores one run, you can\xe2\x80\x99t blame the pitching for not shutting out the opponent and thereby at fault for blowing the game. O\xe2\x80\x99Day can\xe2\x80\x99t be perfect every night, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been very, very good in most games.Again, the Orioles did not get many baserunners in scoring position \xe2\x80\x93 only a total of seven. And the O\xe2\x80\x99s only managed one hit in those situations, making them 3-for-21 during this four-game losing streak.In the category of good news, it certainly appears that Chris Tillman has found his former good stuff and old form. That is great. Now we need to hope that Jimenez has not regressed at the same rate. And we need to hope that Kevin Gausman settles in. And we need to hope that Miguel Gonzalez regains his historic consistency. And we need to hope that Wei-Yin Chen continues his very good season by keeping the fly balls on the fielders\xe2\x80\x99 side of the walls. And we need to hope that the offense can crawl out of the grave \xe2\x80\x93 which may be the most difficult hope of them all. Yes, there is a lot of hoping going on these days.Other good news is that the Yankees and Michael Pineda got trashed by the Twins, 10-1.\xc2\xa0 For there to be any hopes for this 2015 season, the Orioles are going to need this story to repeat often. And again, they have to score more than a mere eight runs in four game stretches.Next: Orioles need a winning streak to startMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles minor league rundown 7/24: Christian Walker makes ...', ' Norfolk Tides 2, Durham (Rays) 0 This game began its life on July 3, but was suspended due to weather at that time.

Steve Johnson picked up where Wright left off by blanking the Bulls for three innings.    Norfolk grabbed two runs in the sixth inning, one each driven in by Christian Walker and Dariel Alvarez. Both of those players had multi-hit games, as did Michael Almanzar. Dana Eveland (yes, really) threw a scoreless eighth, while Oliver Drake, recently activated from the disabled list, pitched the ninth for his 13th save. Norfolk Tides 3, Durham (Rays) 2 (7 innings) Calling Walker\'s name again - in the regularly-scheduled game, he went 3-3 including a double. He\'s been hot lately, as well he needs to be, since he was not hot to start out the season. I\'m about ready to see what he can do instead of Chris Parmelee. ""Christian"" and ""Chris"" - it\'s basically keeping the roster composition the same. They\'re even both lefty-hitting first basemen! Zach Davies started this game for Norfolk, holding the Bulls to two runs on six hits in six innings of work. He did not walk anybody and struck out four batters. That\'ll do.

The facts about Norfolk and Bowie are true. Terry Doyle, who is 29 but still a pretty neat story, did in fact win his 12th game last night, holding the Senators to just one run on a solo home run despite the fact that he gave up 11 hits in 7.2 innings. He has a 2.02 ERA. But just... no. No. My main man Mashin\' (Trey) Mancini kept doing his thing, grabbing three hits including a double in the game. Over 41 games he is now batting .360/.390/.596. Note that he doesn\'t walk, and probably never will walk, so whatever he does, it\'ll be based on his batting average and power, and that, at least so far, is pretty good. Both teams had 12 hits in the game. The Baysox got five runs despite an Oriolesque 1-12 with RISP. Take what you can get.    Frederick Keys 5, Potomac (Walgreens) 1 Five runs on eight hits for Frederick - that\'s making the most of your chances. Chance Sisco had himself a good night, grabbing two hits including a double. He also stole his eighth base of the year. A catcher stealing eight bases? The minor leagues are silly sometimes. I am reminded of the time Joe Mahoney stole 29 bases for Delmarva. Again, both teams had the same number of hits, eight in this case. But it was Frederick who scored the runs. Starter Matt Taylor held the P-Nats to three hits and no runs over five innings of work. He did this while issuing no walks and recording no strikeouts. You don\'t see that every day. Aside: P-Nats manager Tripp Keister was ejected from the game. Haha, his name is Keister. Charleston (Yankees) 8, Delmarva Shorebirds 7 After giving up five runs in the first inning, the Shorebirds rallied to tie the game up at 5-5 and again at 6-6, but the eighth run allowed was just one too many. Ademar Rifaela came a triple short of the cycle for the Shorebirds, scoring three runs in the game. MILB.com says his full name is Ademar Bertty Aloysius Rifaela, which is all kinds of awesome. He\'ll be 21 in November and is sporting a .743 OPS in his first taste of a full season minor league. RiverDogs shortstop Jorge Mateo stole his 67th base in this game. That is not a typo. That\'s just bonkers. Remember this name for some years down the road, because if he doesn\'t get traded, we might be seeing him swiping bases against the O\'s.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsLike many things in life, baseball momentum can snowball; and it can happen in two directions. Over the past 20 games for the Orioles, the snowball effect has been a total avalanche as they lost 75% of those games. But the momentum shifted on Saturday evening, as amazingly a collection of things went right for a change.Even though the Orioles only tallied a total of seven base hits, they were able to bunch five of them in the same inning, scoring four runs on a Chris Davis grand slam. Most of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 recent home runs have been of the solo variety. Davis stepped up at a critical time.Also stepping up was starter Miguel Gonzalez. He gave the Orioles their second consecutive quality start, giving up only an eighth-inning solo shot while yielding five hits in 7.1 innings. If he can get this sort of consistent performance back together, along with Chris Tillman hitting stride, the Orioles will have something. Chen pitches today (Sunday) and has been consistently good. So it comes down to Jimenez and Gausman getting straightened out in order for the rotation to dominate as it did in the latter portion of last season.For the second consecutive day, Manny Machado batted in the number three position in the order. He has been good at leadoff \xe2\x80\xa6 better than most people would give him credit for, in that he is not the prototypical speedster. But he simply has to hit lower in the lineup due to his power production. Truly he is the best hitter now on the Orioles, and third is typically where the top batter is placed. Adam Jones fits well at cleanup, or Chris Davis to break up the two right-handers.

He loaded the bases with a single ahead of Davis, and he also used his speed to add the fifth run on a triple and defensive error.It was odd to see the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup before the game have Chris Davis in the number two spot. In support of that, even though he strikes out at a high rate, he also does draw a lot of walks. And even when his average is not the best, his on base percentage is really never terribly low.But having Davis in the two hole where he hit the game-changing grand slam really makes Showalter look like a genius and prophet once again.The home run was the 178th of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 career, but only the third time out of the second position in the batting order. The first time was August 11th of last year off the Yankee\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Capuano \xe2\x80\x93 a two-run shot that put the O\xe2\x80\x99s ahead in the fifth inning 4-3 on the way to an 11-3 victory. This was the game where Machado was injured for the season, and Davis replaced him at third base while batting second in the lineup. The other occasion was just two weeks ago in Minnesota off Casey Fien, a solo shot that followed the same by Machado.So, it is a win. Take it. Even though the Yankees and Jays also won. Maybe this begins a journey over the next 66 games of the season that can bring the Orioles back into contention.Next: A rare bad day by O'DayMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles take series from Rays with a 5-2 win on Sunday ...', "" The Orioles face what feels like a gargantuan task to ascend the AL East standings. That may be true, but when it comes down to any given game, the only thing to worry about is winning that one game. Win the one in front of you and move on to the next one. Do that enough times and maybe you'll get somewhere. The Orioles took the rubber game of their series against the Rays, 5-2, pulling back into third place in the division, though they still face a seven game deficit to the leading Yankees.    In their ice cold hitting month of July, it's seemed like every hard-hit ball has gone right to a fielder, every bad bounce play has ended up working against the Orioles hitters. There's some bad luck there, even if it feels like more than luck as the events pile up. Sunday's game finally brought the Orioles some fluke hits in their favor, and as it turned out, those were crucial in scoring runs. It was the Orioles who got on board first, grabbing three runs in the first inning. They were helped along to a two-out rally by Adam Jones reaching on an excuse-me swing that ended up with a ground ball into no man's land. That put Chris Davis, who walked earlier, into scoring position. Oh, no! Now they were in trouble. Except not, because J.J. Hardy smoked a grounder between third and short. The ball slowed down enough on the carpet that Davis could score. A hit with RISP! Amazing! Multiple Orioles hits with RISP are, in fact, allowed The next trick was pulled off by Nolan Reimold, whose two-run double gave the Orioles *gasp* back-to-back hits with runners in scoring position. With two outs, even! Yes, that's really allowed, and it gave the Orioles a 3-0 lead against Matt Moore before the Rays had even come up to bat.    As it turned out, the Orioles would not get another hit with RISP in the game. They only had three more chances after the first inning. That still isn't great, but as we know, it can be a lot worse.    In the fourth inning, Jonathan Schoop almost perfectly replicated Jones' first inning grounder, nubbing a ball against the shift towards where a second baseman would normally stand. You gotta take runners any way you can get them right now. And the O's were able to capitalize as Moore badly missed a spot against Caleb Joseph, with the result being a screaming line drive out to left field for Joseph's seventh home run of the season. The O's led 5-0 after their half of the fourth inning. O's starter Wei-Yin Chen retired the first 11 Rays batters he faced before starting to run into some difficulty. Specifically, the difficulty was that he gave up a home run to Evan Longoria on an 0-2 count, and the very next batter, Logan Forsythe, took him deep to almost the same spot on the first pitch. Joey Butler took the very next pitch for a double to deep right. One fly ball to left field later and the inning was over. Probably only David Lough could have run down the ball, so it was a good thing he was in the field today, if not a good thing he was leading off.    Chen has now allowed 19 home runs this season, and I believe all but three of them have been solo home runs. Chen had some more problems in the fifth inning, though he wasn't helped by Reimold overrunning a Tim Beckham fly ball to turn an out into a double to start things off. The Rays ended up turning that into a bases loaded with one out situation, though Chen escaped the jam. When good enough is good enough Two Rays hits in the first three batters to start the sixth inning meant the tying run was at the plate with one out. At this point, manager Buck Showalter had seen enough of Chen, so he summoned Tommy Hunter. 'twas nary a lefty batter in sight, yet Hunter still unloaded a wild pitch before walking Beckham. Luckily for Hunter, his catcher is Caleb Joseph, and on the wild pitch Joseph cut down a runner trying to scoot up to second base. Bad idea, dog. One harmless grounder to Manny Machado later and that was that for the Rays rally.    The day's line on Chen ended up with two runs on six hits and a walk in 5.1 innings of work. He struck out three batters. Not a great day, but a day that ended up being good enough. I haven't mentioned the Orioles hitters for a while because after the Joseph home run, they only got another four hits all game, one of which was erased on a double play and the other resulted in a TOOTBLAN at the plate, with Reimold running through a rare Bobby Dickerson stop sign. Reimold had three hits in the game, which is good, but also had the bad play on defense and that TOOTBLAN. This is not the way to behave when Dan Duquette gazes down from his tower with the Eye of Judgement, Nolan. Fortunately, the lack of further scoring opportunities didn't matter too much because Brad Brach, Darren O'Day, and Zach Britton are all cool dudes who tend to keep the other team from scoring. Each turned in a scoreless inning in this game, with the Rays never advancing a runner past first base against any one of them. They've got a long way still to go, but they didn't fall any farther behind today. That's something.    The Orioles return to Camden Yards on Monday to start a three game series against the Braves. Alex Wood and Kevin Gausman are the scheduled starters for the series opener, which is at the standard civilized baseball time of 7:05pm.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

After batting .338 in April, he is hitting just .230 in July.\xc2\xa0 Markakis has done better on the road for the Braves than he has in Atlanta. He is .318 outside of Georgia, but only .251 at home.

', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles trade rumors: ""Listening to everything,"" league ...', ' After a 4-5 road trip that saw the Orioles win two out of three series but get totally swept in the other one, the Orioles stare down the trade deadline, only four days away, from the wrong side of a .500 record. They stare up at the division leading Yankees from a seven game hole in which they have mostly dug for themselves. So where does that leave them? Buy or sell?    The latest on Monday afternoon, something like 99 hours short of the trade deadline, comes from ESPN\'s Jayson Stark, who writes that the Orioles are out there\xc2\xa0""listening to everything"" as far as teams making offers for their players. However, he also adds that the rest of the league doesn\'t actually believe the Orioles will end up selling. What\'s that tell us? Probably nothing we didn\'t know already, but it\'s still interesting to hear at this point in time that\'s the belief. Stark\'s reporting suggests he hasn\'t actually talked to an Orioles source himself, rather speaking to people who have spoken to the Orioles. Of course, those are the ones who\'d actually be making trades with the team. Whether they should sell or buy is still a hard question to figure out. There\'s a cost to punting on the season. There\'s a cost to trying to salvage the season. There\'s a cost for doing nothing. Everybody has a different opinion on which cost is the one that should be paid, and that\'s probably true within the organization as well.    And the answer could easily change over the next four days. I was adamantly against the very consideration of the Orioles being sellers at the deadline, yet getting swept in New York made the picture so much tougher for the team. Not that they should give up on the season because of one bad series, either. They\'re only 3.5 games out of a wild card spot even with all the struggles they have encountered at different times this season. But what if disaster strikes and they get themselves swept by the Braves too, with the Yankees going in and taking games from the Rangers at the same time? A double digit deficit would almost demand that the team sell off some assets like Chris Davis, Matt Wieters, or Wei-Yin Chen to get potential future contributors. If it gets to that point, it\'s good to have already listened to the offers so you can have some time to evaluate which one is the best.    Hopefully the Orioles put together a nice winning streak over the next few days so the idea of selling can be banished to the depths of loserdom where it belongs.

He was offered a great deal in Atlanta, and one that the Orioles would have been foolish to match at that. In fact, his contract was voted the worst (meaning the least team-friendly) of the off season by MLB GM\xe2\x80\x99s. That\xe2\x80\x99s just another way of saying that Atlanta got ripped off. So in essence, I\xe2\x80\x99m also saying that fans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t blame the Orioles for not bringing Markakis back.Markakis also made some unfortunate comments in the wake of signing with Atlanta, which perhaps justly angered many Orioles fans. However I would submit that Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 body of work with this franchise is too strong and thus too important to simply discard it due to him expressing his opinion about why the O\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring him back.Courtesy of H. Darr Beiser-USA TODAY SportsIf you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a \xe2\x80\x9ctrue Oriole,\xe2\x80\x9d look no further than Markakis. His conduct on and off the field embodied everything that Orioles fans look for in their players. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to many people who have told me they thought he was \xe2\x80\x9cstandoffish,\xe2\x80\x9d or in some cases even rude. But nothing could be further from the truth. He\xe2\x80\x99s simply what we, who\xe2\x80\x99s every step and move isn\xe2\x80\x99t put under the microscope of celebrity, like to call\xc2\xa0shy. And I say that with compassion, because I myself and the same way.Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 wife and kids still live in the Baltimore area, so this will also be a few days where he can visit with them and sleep for a few nights in his own bed. So I suspect that it was a very joyous evening in the Markakis household last night when Atlanta arrived here on their team charter from St. Louis. Not only did Nick get to see his wife and kids, but he got to drive presumably in his own car to his own home.These kinds of stories aren\xe2\x80\x99t uncommon in sports today, as numerous athletes return to their old homes to play their old teams. Most famously in recent history we can look to the NFL and see Brett Favre playing at Lambeau Field as a Minnesota Viking. I suspect that it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a surreal experience for Markakis, especially tonight in the first game of the series. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be in such a familiar place, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll just be different. He\xe2\x80\x99ll run into the third base dugout, have a locker in the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse, but yet be playing right field in a place so familiar to him.And make no mistake about the fact that Atlanta has an advantage over the Orioles in that sense. Right field at Camden Yards does have it\xe2\x80\x99s challenges, and I would submit that the ballpark has seen no better right fielder in it\xe2\x80\x99s history than Nick Markakis. Regardless of who\xe2\x80\x99s playing right field for the Orioles tonight, the visiting right fielder will have much more experience in that position. Thus he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a better idea of how the ball will careem off the wall, bounce, etc.Orioles fans have seen instances like this before; I recall the return of Eddie Murray\xc2\xa0as a visiting player with Cleveland (1994), as well as that of\xc2\xa0Bill Ripken\xc2\xa0a year earlier. It\xe2\x80\x99s always tough to see a beloved player wearing another uniform, however that goes both ways. When you\xe2\x80\x99ve played your entire career in one place and you\xe2\x80\x99re then forced to come back to that place as a visitor and compete against your friends, it just feels strange.There will be some weird moments for Nick Markakis over the course of the next three days. However that\xe2\x80\x99s also true for Orioles fans. This guy meant a lot to this franchise and it\xe2\x80\x99s fans for so long, and now the people are forced to root against him? However as the character\xc2\xa0Hyman Roth famously stated in\xc2\xa0The Godfather Part II,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6this is the business that we have chosen.\xe2\x80\x9dMy sincere hope is that when he comes to bat for the first time as a visitor tonight, the game pauses for just one moment and Markakis gets a standing ovation.

He\'s not the only outfielder on the market, and they are checking around other places as well.\xc2\xa0Jon Heyman of CBS Sports wrote that the Orioles are also one of four teams who are in the picture to possibly acquire outfielder Gerardo Parra from the Brewers.    Parra, like Upton, is a pending free agent at the end of the season. The 28-year-old 5\'11"" lefty has been patrolling both left and right field mostly in his big league career. Unlike Upton, Parra is in the middle of what is by far his best season at the plate of his career. Heading into Monday\'s games, Parra was batting .317/.356/.505 on the season. Is that a fluke or is that a player responding to a change of scenery by taking a step forward in his first full season there? Looking at Parra\'s BABIP of .360, which is 34 points above his career mark, that suggests it might be more likely to be a fluke. In addition, Parra does not rate well for defensive metrics, which is in line with numbers from last season as well. He\'s been worth -4 runs in the outfield in 659.2 innings played. That could be worse. Other teams reportedly interested in Parra, according to Heyman, are the Angels, Mets, and a mystery team. It\'s not rumor season until there\'s a mystery team. The Angels acquired Shane Victorino on Monday but could probably still use another outfielder. The Mets have already surprised people with two deadline trades; maybe they\'ll surprise people again by picking up the rest of Parra\'s $6.24 million salary or maybe they\'ll finally cry poor.    No idea what it might cost the O\'s to pick up Parra. He doesn\'t have the track record of an Upton, so the price he would bring back is probably lower as well. But you never really know with this stuff. And as always we must remember the first law of baseball rumors: Probably nothing will happen. It might, though.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
07/28/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: How does the Troy Tulowitzki trade ...', 'Troy Tulowitzki was the first major trade chip to be made this week \xe2\x80\x93 and he went to Toronto, a team within the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 division. So of course the question being asked today in Birdland is how is this impacting the O\xe2\x80\x99s? And quite frankly, the answer is that we just don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet. That might sound a bit simplistic, but work with me.Toronto sent Jose Reyes to Colorado (along with some prospects, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get into that later). So the teams effectively switched shortstops. Obviously if you disregard the prospects, Toronto got the better end of the deal. If you throw the prospects back in there, it was probably an even trade. But is Tulowitzki the end of Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s endeavors on the trade block?\xc2\xa0Live Feed troy tulowitskiPhoto: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsIf the answer to that question is yes, then I would submit that it might not impact the Orioles too much. And yes I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of the caliber of player that Tulowitzki is. However the Baseball Tonight crew made a great point about this on ESPN last night. Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Rogers Centre does funny things to players \xe2\x80\x93 especially infielders. So while Tulowitzki might well look good hitting there, will their infield defense be as strong? The fact is that we just don\xe2\x80\x99t know, along with the fact that Tulowitski does have a history of injury problems.But that goes back to whether or not Toronto is done with trades. Again as was pointed out on Baseball Tonight, Toronto has always been able to hit. It\xe2\x80\x99s been their pitching that\xe2\x80\x99s been suspect both this year as well as in the past. So could they not take some of the power that they already have and flip it for pitching?If they were to do that, they\xe2\x80\x99d probably become an odds on favorite to win the AL East \xe2\x80\x93 for the time being at least. Now that type of thing is a risky move for sure; look at Oakland last year. They had been in cruise control in their division for the entire way, only to trade Yoenis Cespedes to Boston for John Lester. And they limped into the playoffs as the second wild card \xe2\x80\x93 barely.\xc2\xa0More from Rumors1/18 - Baltimore Orioles: Should the Orioles Resign Mark Trumbo?

Will the prospects they sent out to Colorado pan out as eventual big league players? And will this trading of prospects eventually put Toronto into a roster crunch similar to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Orioles this year? Anything is possible, and the fact is that\xe2\x80\x99s the risk you run.One way or another, this should signal to the Orioles that if they\xe2\x80\x99re really going to go for it, they\xe2\x80\x99ll need to do something. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve hashed out here previously, there\xe2\x80\x99s a group of folks who wants the Orioles to sell. Regardless of whether it\xe2\x80\x99s buying or selling (I maintain they should be buyers), they need to do something. Standing pat at the trade deadline won\xe2\x80\x99t cut it.

The Orioles won 2-1. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsMatt Wieters\xc2\xa0saved the Baltimore Orioles on Monday night by delivering two critical hits: a single that moved the game-tying run to third in the bottom of the ninth, and a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th inning. He may have saved more than just a game. We may remember this critical win for a long time.Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 clutch hit in the ninth came off former Orioles closer Jim Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 his fourth blown save of the season. Finally a Johnson blown save helps the O\xe2\x80\x99s! \xc2\xa0But honestly, he has had at least a decent season for the Braves.

It was the fourth walk-off bomb in Matt\xe2\x80\x99s career, this one stroked well out in deep right-center field. Nolan Reimold came just a few feet short of doing the same thing in the previous inning (Reimold had a single, double and walk in five plate appearances in the leadoff position \xe2\x80\x93 hopefully beginning a trend.).

This was his 36th such homer, hitting one in every 22 at-bats from that side. Though he has 60 career homers when batting left-handed, they only occur once in every 34 at-bats. His career average is also 27 points better versus lefties, though over the portions in has played in the past two years (as well as his first two years in MLB) just the opposite was true.The numbers for Matt Wieters in this regard are very, very odd. Take a look at the chart below. For the middle three years of his seven-year career thus far, he was far better as a right-handed hitter.

One would hope that the day would come when he hits equally well from both sides of the plate.Perhaps bigger than the Wieters hits was the great outing by Kevin Gausman, going 7.2 innings of outstanding, scoreless pitching. All his pitches were working, and hopefully this too sets him up for the remainder of the season. It is unfortunate that the \xe2\x80\x9coptions problems\xe2\x80\x9d of so much of the roster has worked against Gausman being able to really settle in as a big league starter.Other than the homer given up, oddly, by Zach Britton, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching was excellent. This was especially true in scoring position situations, as the Braves were 0-for-9 with RISP (and the O\xe2\x80\x99s were 0-for-4).The welcome home for Nick Markakis was appropriately warm.

As he strode to the plate to lead off the game, the Camden faithful rose to it\xe2\x80\x99s feet in a standing ovation. Markakis, ever the humble gentleman, eventually stepped out of the batters box and doffed his cap to the fans. Each time Markakis would come to bat during the game, he\xe2\x80\x99d get a nice hand \xe2\x80\x93 a trend I expect to continue all week. And it\xe2\x80\x99s well deserved.The Orioles took a scoreless tie into the ninth inning with Atlanta last night, and Zach Britton was summoned from the \xe2\x80\x98pen in the top of the ninth. After recording one out, Adonis Garcia came to the plate and promptly gave Atlanta a 1-0 lead with a solo homer. When there\xe2\x80\x99s no score, all it takes is one mistake by a reliever and suddenly someone\xe2\x80\x99s in line to win. Britton\xe2\x80\x99s sinker didn\xe2\x80\x99t sink properly on one pitch, and we saw the result.However in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 home yard they bat last \xe2\x80\x93 home team bats last, remember?! Adam Jones got on base in the last of the ninth with an\xc2\xa0excuse me swinging bunt. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he meant to hit the ball up the third base line, and Atlanta certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting it. However he placed it just perfectly enough to where Atlanta closer (and former Oriole) Jim Johnson couldn\xe2\x80\x99t throw him out at first base. The Orioles ended up with runners at the corners following a Wieters single, and they tied the game on a J.J. Hardy sac fly-RBI.Again folks, home team bats last! Unfortunately for fans, media, and players, the game didn\xe2\x80\x99t ust end in the tenth inning. However we did see Atlanta manager Freddie Garcia do somethin curious, a stunt which he also pulled in the eighth inning: he IBB\xe2\x80\x99d Chris Davis with a runner on second. When he did it in the eighth I felt is was warranted given that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t totally mean the game at that point. However I thought it was curious in the tenth given that Machado hits-for-average much better than Davis. All the Orioles needed at that point was a base hit as opposed to a home run \xe2\x80\x93 but both times it worked in Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s favor.Whenever a game goes to extras people start wondering when it\xe2\x80\x99s eventually going to end. Are we in for a marathon game of some sort? Is someone eventually going to score? The good news for the Orioles is that once again they get their last at-bat at home.

Zach Britton came on for the final out, preserving the 2-0 victory on the strength of solo home runs by Jonathan Schoop and J.J.

As well, the umpire REALLY missed a called third strike against Hardy on the pitch before he hit a hanging curve ball into the seats.I am not saying that the Orioles were lucky to win. No, they played better than the Braves \xe2\x80\x93 who are frankly not a very good baseball team.

The Orioles are rumored to be working on a deal to pick up Gerardo Parra from the Milwaukee Brewers on Thursday night. To get Parra, they would send back prospect Zach Davies and possibly more to the Brewers.    My counterpart Nathan Bishop over at Lookout Landing, the Mariners blog, was the first to report on the trade, although no, I don\'t know how he knew. It is a fact that Nathan\xc2\xa0reported the return in the Carlos Gomez trade to Houston before anyone else. Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports and others indicated that the return of Davies may not be enough to fetch Parra, on whom the Brewers have placed a high price tag. This could be an evolving deal, or it may not end up coming to fruition after all. Parra, 28, is a pending free agent at the end of the year. He\'s picked a good year to have the best year of his career, batting .324/.367/.517 through 99 games. Something that\'s probably contributing to those career-best numbers is career-best BABIP luck. Parra\'s sporting a .370 BABIP, far above his career average of .327.    One would hope that the Orioles were expecting some regression as they consider making this trade, but it will bear watching. If Parra comes here and looks more like the .279/.330/.407 hitter he has been in his career, neither they nor we should be surprised. Of course, given the Orioles\' current outfield situation, it\'s probably still an improvement if they can plug in the lefty Parra, play him every day at a corner spot, and part ways with someone expendable in the process.    Parra is making $6.24 million this season, so the O\'s would be on the hook for in the realm of $2 million for the rest of the season. Davies was considered the #3 prospect in the Orioles system by the recently-released\xc2\xa0MLB.com Top 30 Prospects list. That\'s kind of eye-popping to give up for a rental and indeed it could be something the O\'s regret - but realistically the fact that Davies is #3 says more about the O\'s system than it does about Davies.    Drafted in the 26th round in 2011, Davies has chugged through the system at one level per season, performing capably at each level, including his 3.02 ERA this season for Norfolk in 18 games. The question about him is whether he\'ll be able to harness a slight frame (6\'0"" and 150 lbs. listed) to success in the big leagues. He\'s only 22, still young, and since he has yet to appear in MLB, he\'s got the full six years of team control. Maybe he will be able to succeed in MLB; if he does, he will probably make us sigh with regret from his spot in the back of the Milwaukee rotation for several years, much like we raise our fists to the sky in anguish over the trade of Eduardo Rodriguez last year. Maybe Davies will wash out because there\'s little margin for error for a guy with that profile. I had figured he\'d be in the competition for the back end of the O\'s rotation next season, along with Mike Wright and Tyler Wilson. I guess it\'s down to Wright and Wilson now. As I watch the Orioles pitchers get blasted by the depleted Tigers, my gut reaction to this trade is that it\'s not going to be enough to help the team get into the playoffs, so what is the point? And meantime they might wish they had Davies next year. It\'s all about taking risks, though. If Parra keeps up his scorching hot contract year and gives the O\'s lineup the shot in the arm it needs to get to a wild card spot, then maybe we won\'t miss Davies that much after all.    Orioles beat writers are starting to wake up that something might be going on as well:  #orioles are talking to #brewers about Parra & #phillies about Revere. No deals are done. AAA Norfolk RHP Zach Davis part of discussions\r \xe2\x80\x94 Roch Kubatko (@masnRoch) July 31, 2015     Keep your eyes peeled!  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles top 30 prospect list paints clear ... - Camden Chat', "" Trade deadline season is upon us, and the Orioles, as you have probably noticed, have thus far done jack squat. There is a real need on the team for a corner outfielder, and though the O's are coveting their competitor's players, nothing is happening because those competitors are also coveting players the Orioles have no interest in trading.    MASN's Roch Kubatko wrote before yesterday's game about the situation, indicating that teams\xc2\xa0have been asking for Manny Machado, Jonathan Schoop, Kevin Gausman, and Mychal Givens, and the Orioles won't be moving those players. Forget for a second why Givens is apparently untouchable - with those other names, well, duh, of course there won't be any trades when you're asking for those guys. And when considering that the\xc2\xa0two top Orioles prospects in the minors also seem to be untouchable, well, who is there left to trade, really? Those top two prospects, Hunter Harvey and Dylan Bundy, are an interesting case in and of themselves. Harvey has yet to pitch in 2015 due to a small fracture he suffered in spring training and then, when returning from that, some worrisome vague arm troubles. Bundy was on a very light work schedule, making mostly three inning starts as he worked back from his 2013 Tommy John surgery, before being shut down due to having calcification in his shoulder - an uncommon injury. In the recently unveiled Top 30 prospects list for MLB Pipeline, both Harvey and Bundy still rated among the top 100 prospects in all of baseball, though not as highly as they once did. Harvey rates 70th; Bundy rates 77th. Some parts of the prospect-industrial complex have dropped them out of top lists entirely due to the uncertainty around their injuries. If the Orioles did trade either one, it could prove to be selling low on those guys. It could also be that the O's are optimistic about both and they really believe they're a part of the team's future, too.    So the team's three best young major leaguers are justifiably off the table in any of these rental trades. The team's two top prospects appear to be untouchable as well. When you scratch those names off, you can quickly see why, given the deals that have been consummated so far, the Orioles aren't getting anything done for Justin Upton, Carlos Gomez, or any of those guys.    MLB.com's Top 10 Orioles prospects    Rank Player Age Position Acquired (Round/Overall) Highest Level   1 Hunter Harvey 20 RHP 2013 draft (1/22) Low-A   2 Dylan Bundy 22 RHP 2011 draft (1/4) MLB   3 Zach Davies 22 RHP 2011 draft (26/785) Triple-A   4 D.J. Stewart 21 OF 2015 draft (1/25) Short-A   5 Jomar Reyes 18 3B Int'l amateur signing Jan '14 Low-A   6 Christian Walker 24 1B 2012 draft (4/132) MLB   7 Mychal Givens 25 RHP 2009 draft (2/54) MLB   8 Mike Wright 25 RHP 2011 draft (3/94) MLB   9 Chance Sisco 20 C 2013 draft (2/61) High-A   10 Tyler Wilson 25 RHP 2011 draft (10/305) MLB    One quick note about the above list - for reasons that I don't understand, MLB.com has not included any players who are exempt from the international amateur signing pool. That's any player 23+ with several years professional experience in another country and so the kinds of Cuban players that Dan Duquette loves to sign, such as Dariel Alvarez, Henry Urrutia, and Ariel Miranda are not included.    Alvarez might crack the top 10 if considered; Miranda would potentially be a bottom of the list player. I think Urrutia is what he is. So it's not a perfect representation of the strength or weakness of the Orioles farm, given that it's intentionally excluding a class of player the Orioles seem to intentionally target, but it's close enough. Stars and sure solid regulars just aren't here Of the players listed above, the only ones who ever looked like they might be on some kind of star or solid big leaguer trajectory were Harvey and Bundy, and now they've got those injury concerns. You get into the back half of this top 10 and four of the five players are 24-25. Givens, a late convert to pitching, may not have hit his ceiling, but the other three probably are what they are. You throw them into a competition and see if they win. Wright and Wilson will fight for the same back end of the rotation spot next year, probably. Maybe Wright's future is really taking a stab at being a back-end power reliever. The younger Davies will probably also be fighting for the same rotation spot. Walker could be a low-cost, good-enough first baseman to replace Chris Davis next year, or he could be a guy who's OPSing .714 in Triple-A.    It's good that three of these guys have seen a little MLB time as it means they're not total busts. If you collect fringe pieces in later rounds, you're drafting and developing alright, at least with those guys. You better duck - the ceilings aren't high The younger position players could turn into interesting names with time, but they're a long way away. Reyes has looked like a potential breakout player in his first taste of full season ball. Sisco is maintaining his hit tool in High-A, though he's battled some injuries this year and his future as a catcher is in doubt. The just-drafted Stewart is ranked fourth on this list but outlets like ESPN and Baseball Prospectus are not fans of what he has to offer in the professional ranks. None of these three are blessed with the kind of tools that gets every prospect maven buzzing about them. They will have to develop into something, and they're not the kind that's seen as having monster, star ceilings they might some day reach. And even supposing the Orioles did trade a Sisco or a Reyes, well, heck, then what kind of pipeline do they have to the majors among position players? The cupboard is already bare at the top and if you move one of them, it's pretty bare at the bottom too. Plus, if you do move those guys, what are they worth? Wright, Sisco, and some lower-tier guy like Tim Berry (LHP - #19) probably aren't getting you a star outfielder like Justin Upton, even as a two month rental. The Orioles won't deal from the top, and probably shouldn't deal from the top. They don't have much of a mid-level they can deal from, and probably shouldn't deal any of that either. Which leaves you with filler, and filler gets you... nothing worth writing home about. Where does that leave the Orioles? They practically have to do something on the trade market about their corner outfield situation, and yet they also basically can't do anything on the trade market for lack of tradeable surplus pieces. Inertia is not very exciting. Unless Duquette pulls a rabbit out of his hat, it will have to suffice.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

With a few hours still left until the 4 p.m. deadline, they already had an upgrade that would help them stay in the hunt in the American League East.\r And it came at a small cost \xe2\x80\x94 small enough that the atmosphere in the clubhouse was loose as it would be on a normal day. Relief pitcher Tommy Hunter even joked about being traded himself.\r The next move, however, didn\xe2\x80\x99t provoke nearly the same mood. A few minutes later, the Orioles traded Hunter, a 29-year-old in his fourth full season with the team, to the Chicago Cubs for outfielder Junior Lake.\r The management informed Hunter, and Hunter said his final goodbyes to teammates on the way out. Then manager Buck Showalter walked into his pregame press conference and asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x99s everybody so solemn?\xe2\x80\x9d     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Cubs acquire reliever Hunter from Orioles for LakeThe net impact of Friday on the big-league club, of course, is positive. Entering Friday, Baltimore was hitting .210 and slugging just .330 in the left-field slot, occupied most often by David Lough, Travis Snider and Nolan Reimold. Parra brings a .328 average and .517 slugging percentage and has won two Gold Glove awards. He fills a void in the lineup, perhaps in the leadoff slot, allowing third baseman Manny Machado to move down.\r In return, the Orioles gave up Class AAA right-hander Zach Davies. In 19 appearances (18 starts) this season, Davies posted a 2.84 earned-run average.\r \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one of those that should work out really well for both clubs,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cGot a good player back and gave up a good pitching prospect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r But as with most teams, the day didn\xe2\x80\x99t go calmly.     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } MLB trade deadline tracker: Players on the move\r Early in the afternoon, Baltimore designated right-hander Bud Norris for assignment. Norris was a critical piece of the 2014 Orioles that won the AL East and swept Detroit in the AL Divisional Series, winning 15 games and shutting out the Tigers over 6.1 innings in the clinching game of the series.\r But he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t recapture that success this year in the rotation or the bullpen. In 11 starts and seven relief outings, his ERA is 7.06.\r \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder of about how things snowball mentally and emotionally,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s physically fine. Someone\xe2\x80\x99s going to pick him up, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to pitch well for them.\r \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got some really good pitching ahead of him. It just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r Later in the day, just before the deadline, came the more shocking move. Hunter moved to the bullpen full-time in 2013, and since then he has a 3.05 ERA in 191 2/3 innings for the team.\r As with Norris, losing him and adding a different arm to the bullpen gives the Orioles the flexibility to option a reliever, and the club adds another outfield bat in Junior Lake. Still, after the day had gone smoothly until then, Showalter called losing Hunter \xe2\x80\x9ctough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r \xe2\x80\x9cTommy never has a bad day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cVery infectious possibility, and he can pitch.\xe2\x80\x9d     .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }     .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }     p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; } Blue Jays keep dealing, acquire Ben Revere and Mark LoweHe added that Hunter remained upbeat after the trade, that he was the one cheering up the team\xe2\x80\x99s management.\r \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to stomp out of here like I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d Hunter told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I loved it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r But Showalter said the Orioles ended Friday as a better baseball team than they started it. They had to, with the New York Yankees leading them in the AL East by six games and the Toronto Blue Jays going all-in and acquiring shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, ace David Price, reliever Mark Lowe and outfielder Ben Revere. The Orioles became more capable of keeping pace.\r On July 31, sometimes instability comes as a side-effect.\r \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re trying to win a world championship this year,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what it\xe2\x80\x99s all about. That\xe2\x80\x99s the situation we\xe2\x80\x99re in.

Many questioned if that was the proper move to make after falling seven games back of the first-place New York Yankees and five games back from the final wild card spot.More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryThe Orioles have now won five of their last six and find themselves right in the thick of things in the American League. Duquette was sitting back watching the Blue Jays make two big trades to acquire Troy Tulowitzki and David Price. The Yankees went for Dustin Ackley. Now, the Orioles have made their move with the trade for former Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Gerardo Parra.Parra is the corner outfielder the Orioles been looking for that will consistently man one of the corner outfield spots. However, for every addition there is a subtraction, and for the Orioles, they decided to cut ties with pitcher Bud Norris when they designated him for assignment today.The Orioles have 10 days to trade or release Norris, who agreed to a one-year, $8.8 million arbitration contract this offseason. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be a free agent after the\xc2\xa0season.Norris lost his rotation spot earlier this month after starting the season 2-7 with a 6.79 ERA. He was sent to the bullpen for the first time in his big league career and the numbers were even worse. He posted an 8.44 ERA over 10 2/3 relief innings. The most troubling stat was the fact that he has given up 14 home runs in just 66 1/3 innings this season.Norris pitched just last night and his relief performance was not a good one to end his Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 career. He was charged with four runs on six hits in 2 2/3 innings of relief in the 9-8 loss to the Detroit Tigers.The O\xe2\x80\x99s were hopeful to find a trade partner for Norris in recent weeks, but that was unsuccessful. They technically still could by today\xe2\x80\x99s 4 p.m. non-waiver trade deadline, but that window is shrinking quickly.It is a hard fall for Norris who was a significant piece in the rotation last season. Norris was 15-8 with a 3.65 ERA in 28 starts a year ago and was the winning pitcher in Game 3 of the ALDS win at Detroit, tossing 6 1/3 scoreless innings in the 2-1 victory.\xc2\xa0oriolesCall to the Pen 1 dBaltimore Orioles reliever Brad Brach: From afterthought to starring roleMore headlines around FanSided:1 d - Baltimore Orioles: Zach Britton Injury Isn't So Devastating2d - MLB: Laz Diaz strikes again - But the pitch was outside, of course2d - Boston Red Sox Coming Down Hard on Racism2d - Baltimore Orioles Zach Britton Out Six to Eight Weeks4d - Are the Red Sox and Orioles baseball's new rivalry?More News at Birds Watcher  It\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder of how quickly a year can go from good to bad and vice versa. Norris was nearly untouchable until this season. Last season, it was Ubaldo Jimenez that was terrible and he\xe2\x80\x99s turned it around this year. Their contractual obligations are why one survived and the other did not. Jimenez was in the first year of his deal. Norris was a few months away from leaving anyways likely. That\xe2\x80\x99s just a part of the game.The move to the bullpen was in part of Norris\xe2\x80\x99 shaky performances, but also the emergence of Kevin Gausman, which made it tough for the Orioles to stay with six starting pitchers. Eventually, Buck Showalter decided to go with his young phenom over the pending free agent.\xe2\x80\x9cIt was always six starters for five spots,\xe2\x80\x9d Norris said in a phone interview with Roch Kubatko of MASNsports.com. \xe2\x80\x9cGausman is a good pitcher and deserves to be here every day.\xe2\x80\x9dIt is easy to get caught up in the action and forget that these are people too. Norris was vested in the community with charitable organizations and active on Twitter with fans as well. I have personally seen him at local bars and restaurants and he was always approachable which is not always the case for professional athletes. He showed the type of man he is by not attacking the organization that just sent him packing, but wishing them the best as the Orioles continue their playoff push.\xe2\x80\x9cI was looking way too much into distractions this year, and they were eating at me,\xe2\x80\x9d Norris said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s probably best for me right now and best for the team. The 2014 season was a magic ride and now they\xe2\x80\x99re trying ot get back to the postseason and do it again. I wish my teammates the best.\xe2\x80\x9dPersonally, I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised it was Norris who got the ax instead of Chris Parmelee or any of the other outfielders on the roster. Norris showed us last season that he has the tools to make it in the Majors. Parmelee has done little in his stint in Baltimore. Steve Pearce was fantastic last season, but has not shown this season that he is capable of an everyday role. David Lough has never been the player that the Orioles had hoped for that could get on base and steal bags. For whatever reason, it is Norris on his way out.While the move to release Bud Norris makes sense for the Orioles, we wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.

The Dominican outfielder has batted .241 over parts of three seasons with the Cubs, but will report to Norfolk.The Orioles are hopeful that a change in scenery might do some good for Lake, who possess some power as well as base running ability.

Maybe they aren\'t done upgrading that outfield, which, let\'s face it, probably could use more than one real outfielder as an upgrade over what\'s there right now. The Orioles are still talking with the Phillies about outfielder Ben Revere, who would bring them a speedy player with a good OBP who could actually bat leadoff. That\'s something the team simply lacks and has for some time.    On top of the rumored pursuit of Revere, you\'ve also got ESPN\'s Buster Olney casually throwing out that the Orioles\xc2\xa0""could still make a Yoenis Cespedes deal work"" even having gotten Parra from the Brewers. This one seems like pie-in-the-sky dreaming to me, but who knows. I suspect Olney is suggesting the Orioles have things the Tigers want and if they give up those things, they can get Cespedes. He\'s probably talking about getting into the Kevin Gausman tier of player there, and who wants to do that, even for an outfielder who\'s sporting an .829 OPS this season? The team has a problem in the outfield, yes, but its bigger problem, short and long term, is starting pitching. Giving up Gausman for a two-month rental (or probably giving up Gausman at all) would be insane.\xc2\xa0Jon Heyman of CBS Sports confirms the high price for Cespedes would include Gausman for Baltimore. Don\'t get your hopes up for Revere, either, because he is\xc2\xa0drawing interest from the Blue Jays as well, who seem to be determined to get all of the players at this trading deadline. And when looking at Revere, a player with two more years of control - at arbitration prices that will increase from this year\'s $4.1 million - the cost for him will or maybe should be unpalatable. That\'s the way it is when you have a mostly empty farm system. There\'s not any word yet about what the Phillies might want from the O\'s for him, though.    Revere, 27, is batting .298/.334/.379 this season. Not an impressive slugging percentage by any means, but the average and on-base percentage are in line with his career performance, so unlike the recently-acquired Parra, there\'s no reason to suspect or fear regression there. Revere stole 49 bases last year and he\'s stolen 24/29 bases this year. Again, that\'s a player with a skill set the Orioles simply don\'t have, so you can see why he\'d draw interest. Remember always the law of baseball rumors: Probably nothing will happen. But then sometimes it does. There are four hours to go until the non-waiver deadline. Perhaps Dan Duquette will do something else in that time.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
08/01/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Additions and Subtractions Improve Team', 'Jul 31, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles newly acquired outfielder Gerardo Parra (18) sits on the bench during the third inning against the Detroit Tigers at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsIt was a busy day for Baltimore Orioles Vice President of Baseball Operations Dan Duquette. Though some may criticize him for not getting a deal done with the Phillies to bring Ben Revere to the O\xe2\x80\x99s (instead of seeing him go to the Jays), it is difficult to not see that the team is better today than it was yesterday.Addition \xe2\x80\x93 Gerardo Parra \xe2\x80\x93 Traded midday for minor league pitcher Zach Davies, we wrote more extensively about this earlier. There is no doubt that he has been and most certainly will be better than anyone the Orioles have run out to left field this year. He has the best batting average in all of baseball since the beginning of May.MASN\xe2\x80\x99s broadcast caught some great pictures of him arriving in the dugout in the second inning and systematically greeting player after player. It was a good look. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet Buck even says \xe2\x80\x9cI like the look in his eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He has the immediate appearance of a good team guy.Again, alone he will not make the WHOLE difference, but this is an upgrade for sure. He is a rental, but as Duquette said when interviewed on the broadcast last night, \xe2\x80\x9cWho knows, maybe we can keep him in the future too.\xe2\x80\x9dAddition \xe2\x80\x93 Junior Lake \xe2\x80\x93 Received from the Cubs in a trade for Tommy Hunter. He will go to Norfolk. You gotta like the name, if nothing else!Lake, an outfielder, is only age 25. In 64 games in 2013 for the Cubs, he looked like the real deal by hitting .284 with an OBP of .332.\xc2\xa0 He has not been able to replicate that since then. Lake is a .299 career hitter in AAA.Several have compared him to a current Orioles player, as Duquette said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a player very similar to Jimmy Paredes \xe2\x80\xa6 but hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to establish himself.\xe2\x80\x9dHe does not look like an All-Star in the making \xe2\x80\x93 having only moderate power \xe2\x80\x93 but it was something in return for Hunter who will be a free agent after the season.Addition \xe2\x80\x93 Mychal Givens \xe2\x80\x93 Called up from AA to fill the spot vacated by Hunter.Reports are that everyone was asking about getting Givens in a trade. He has been a strikeout machine at Bowie. The converted, side-arming former infielder picked up the win last night in his second MLB game. He did not look overpowered at all!Addition \xe2\x80\x93 Mike Wright \xe2\x80\x93 Called up from AAA as a presumptive long reliever upon the DFA of Bud Norris.Wright made some earlier starts for the Orioles this season and looks at this point to be the frontrunner for a fifth slot next year in the rotation.

He\xe2\x80\x99s no closer \xe2\x80\x93 we know that. But he was, for the most part, an effective big-league reliever. But Tommy could give up some home runs and is not quite an elite bullpen arm, even with his high-90s velocity.Again, this was a chance to get something for him in light of his free agency, and along the way it was a bit of a salary dump to help pay for the Parra acquisition and the dollars on the books for such as Norris.I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure Hunter is the best for Wrigley Field, but Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop have given the Cubs confidence in trading with the Orioles.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoSubtraction \xe2\x80\x93 Bud Norris \xe2\x80\x93 This is simply sad, sad, sad; but it had to happen.\xc2\xa0 After a great 2014, it never worked out this year. But what a great year and what a really good guy is Norris. Just love the competitor. Full honesty, his talent is marginal, and for success he has to be finely-tuned and approaching a flawless pitch-to-pitch performance. Miguel Gonzalez is similar. The only really stellar season that Norris had was last year. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve written in the past, I had the same illness as a college pitcher and was worthless until the next year \xe2\x80\x93 it looked and felt good enough soon after recovering, but the results were like what Norris has seen happen. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll pick up with someone in the future and contribute again.Subtraction \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Parmalee \xe2\x80\x93 Designated for AssignmentIt just didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out. He had the good AAA season and a quick start with the O\xe2\x80\x99s. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame Duquette for taking a flier on this guy. Perhaps this is another example of someone who cannot be successful in a platooning situation. Or perhaps he is just a 4A player. It is too bad it did not work out. With the loss of Davis pending after this season, Parmelee was certainly a very slick fielder at first base.Subtraction \xe2\x80\x93 Zach Davies \xe2\x80\x93 Traded to the Brewers for Gerardo ParraAgain, check back to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s analysis for details. He certainly looks to be on the cusp of becoming a big league starter. Davies is a smart pitcher. We will remember him as originally one of our own as we watch what becomes of him with the Brewers.Parra did not get into the Friday night game to show us what that will look like at the top of the order, but it should be good along with Manny Machado.Of course, none of these improvements will make any real difference if Orioles starters continue to only get 10 outs before getting knocked out of the game, as has happened the past two evenings.Next: Thinking about the Parra / Davies trade ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Tommy Hunter was part of something \\u2026', ""First and foremost, I hope that Baltimore Orioles fans will join me in wishing Tommy Hunter well in Chicago.

Viviano mentioned that Tommy Hunter was a part of what became a very close-knit group of players that in effect oversaw the return to glory of a once great franchise. While many fans like to mock Hunter and claim that all he does is give up home runs, think about that for a moment.Photo: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsHunter was traded to the Orioles as part of the trade which brought Chris Davis here in 2011 (the O\xe2\x80\x99s sent Koji Uehara to Texas in exchange for those two). They joined the likes of Adam Jones, Nick Markakis, Matt Wieters, and others to form a team that would immediately become part of the post season discussion the following year \xe2\x80\x93 up to and including now. However even before that, many of these guys gelled together; how can one forget the close of the 2011 season that September?!To his credit, Hunter seemed like he genuinely was going to miss Baltimore and his Orioles teammates. Over that period of time, there\xe2\x80\x99s been no closer-knit team. Hunter addressed this, and his experiences in Baltimore almost immediately after getting the news of the trade (quote courtesy of Roch Kubatko of MASNsports):There were some great times. Just look at the last four years. Came over in \xe2\x80\x9911 and the crazy thing that happened in \xe2\x80\x9911 in September, just the way the team played. That was probably one of the coolest months I\xe2\x80\x99ve had in baseball, in 2011, when this team finished last and the walk-off and all that crazy stuff that happened at the end of the year. And \xe2\x80\x9912, shocking the world, I guess, and doing everything. And \xe2\x80\x9913, missing it a little bit. And \xe2\x80\x9914 having that Delmon Young hit, probably the loudest stadium I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been in. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fun times here and a lot of good people and a lot of friendships made. Hopefully, they continue through the years.Ultimately my point is the fact that my hope is that Orioles fans remember Hunter with fond memories. Pitchers are going to give up home runs \xe2\x80\x93 especially relievers. However Tommy Hunter is a name that should forever by synonymous with the Orioles returning to their rightful place in baseball. In no way am I suggesting that he was the sole reason for that or anything of the like. But he\xe2\x80\x99s a part of a group of guys that really did something special with this team and this city.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerTen or fifteen years from now, the core group of Orioles from 2012 until whenever will still be viewed as hero\xe2\x80\x99s to the people in the city. Even if the Birds go off and become a dynasty of sorts which lasts until that time, it will always have started with many of the names (and more) that I addressed above. (Heck, I would argue that it all began with a walk off RBI-double by Robert Andino.) And Tommy Hunter is very much a part of that group. Baltimore is a place where special people are always remembered well, even long after their time.And my hope is that Orioles fans remember that. If this franchise goes onward to win a World Series this year or in the future, odds are that Hunter won\xe2\x80\x99t be a part of it. (Keeping in mind of course that he could still return as a free agent after the season.) However he\xe2\x80\x99ll still hold a special place in the lore of this franchise, being such a part of the resurgence of the Orioles.

He was dealing for the second straight game, the only blemish a two-run home run by Nick Castellanos.

Mike Wright is on the DL, and could be out a month with a leg strain.Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x98s ankle is improving, but he likely won\xe2\x80\x99t be making Monday\xe2\x80\x99s start.

08/04/2015,"[('Why Orioles pitcher Tyler Wilson has what it takes to ...', ' It wasn\'t long ago, just prior to the trade deadline, that Orioles right-hander Tyler Wilson was looked at as trade bait. He had come up to the Bigs earlier in the season to showcase himself for other teams. He was a Major League-ready arm that could help the O\'s nab an older, more experienced player to bolster their roster.    Fast forward to last night in Oakland. Wilson is still donning the black and orange, making a spot start in place of Opening Day starter Chris Tillman for the playoff-pushing Birds. 100 pitches later, Wilson had tossed 7.2 innings of two-run ball, striking out three and walking two en route to his second Major League win. It was the type of performance that turns heads. Add to it the fact that Wilson now has six total appearances for the O\'s this year, with a trim ERA of 2.19, and now you really have something. The starting rotation, which was once a log jam, looks like it may clear itself up some by next spring. Bud Norris was recently jettisoned. Wei-Yin Chen may leave for a big contract elsewhere. And it always seems as if Miguel Gonzalez is rumored to be going to the bullpen. The 25-year-old Wilson is quickly put into position to potentially be a big contributor in 2016. But does he have the skill-set to succeed long-term at the Major League level? It happens fairly routinely: a player performs at Triple-A, and perhaps even does well for a bit in the Bigs, but inevitably, the wheels fall off due to the lack of some sort of gene or DNA strand.    Let\'s discuss this in a positive manner. I will leave the comments open for opposing viewpoints.    Why Wilson can make it? First, let\'s talk about his approach to pitching. To anyone who has watched Wilson pitch, it\'s clear that he lacks what we would call ""overpowering stuff"". His fastball sits 88-92, which from a non-knuckleball-throwing right-hander is fairly slow. However, it\'s not as if Wilson is just figuring this little tid-bit out. He sticks to a rule that many high school coaches preach: pitch to contact. That\'s not the same as leaving the ball over the middle of the plate, but it also differs from nibbling too much too. What this approach has led to is Baseball America giving Wilson the title of ""Best Control"" in the Orioles organization following the 2012 season. And it is a good trait to have when given the fact that the Orioles have some of the best fielders in the game supporting each day\'s pitcher.    This year, he has bared the fruit that comes from such pitching. After seeing his walks per nine innings climb to a career worst 3.61 in 2013 with Frederick, Wilson has since limited his free passes to 1.77 per nine innings with Norfolk and 1.82 with Baltimore. You know who else had a career walk per nine of 1.8? Greg Maddux. That\'s all I\'m saying. (just kidding, I don\'t think he is the next Maddux) That brings us to the other reason Wilson can make it: he\'s smart. I\'m not talking about book smart or what his SAT and ACT scores were coming out of high school. Instead, I mean that he learns from his experiences and it shows on the stat sheet. During his six-game stint with Delmarva in 2012, Wilson struck out 8.16 batters per nine innings, but he also walked 3.09 per nine as well. This led to a chunky 5.06 ERA. A few months later with Frederick, he cut down on the walks, down to 1.54, and also chopped 1.5 runs off of his ERA.    It\'s been a semi-similar pattern over the years at many levels for Wilson. For him, high strikeout totals don\'t necessarily correlate to more wins or lower ERA\'s. But, every time he cuts down on the number of Ball Four\'s that he gives out, he sees a good bump to his stats. Will Wilson make it? What do I look like? A fortune teller? It will all depend on this off-season. Are the Orioles likely to sign or trade for a big name pitcher that would automatically slot into the rotation? Highly unlikely. So, Wilson will probably be fighting with a handful of other pitchers, including the likes of Mike Wright and maybe even T.J. McFarland and Brian Matusz (is that experiment over yet?) for one spot behind Chris Tillman, Ublado Jimenez, Kevin Gausman and (probably) Gonzalez. Now, do I want him to make it? Heck yeah! His name is Tyler. That\'s just super cool by itself. Plus, have you seen his sideburns? Or have you noticed the fact that he wears stirrups? He has immediately become the best-dressed Oriole and it\'s not even close. We need the style points big time. And look at\xc2\xa0this website with his wife Chelsea! All kinds of lovable! All levity aside, what Wilson has done thus far has been impressive. He has earned his keep down on the farm and worked through the minor leagues one level at a time after being a 10th round draft out of the University of Virginia back in 2011. He got a $20,000 signing bonus and went to work. I can get behind that. That\'s it from me, Camden Chat. I want to know what YOU think of Wilson thus far and how far he can go. Let me know with a comment down below or tweet me @_TyYoung. Thanks for reading!  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Should Dan Duquette look for August \\u2026', ""I think that the consensus around Baltimore Orioles fans is that Dan Duquette did a decent job for the Birds at the non-waiver trade deadline last week. My personal opinion is that he addressed the club\xe2\x80\x99s most pressing need in obtaining a strong-hitting corner outfielder. However the trade season isn\xe2\x80\x99t over \xe2\x80\x93 not by a long shot.Growing up watching baseball in the summers, I nary recall too many trades occuring past July 31st. However in recent years I would submit that trades in August (through waivers) have become more and more popular. The Orioles have done it a few times over the past couple of seasons, as have numerous other clubs. Basically a team puts a player on waivers, which means he can be claimed by any other team (in the order of the standings). If he isn\xe2\x80\x99t claimed, he\xe2\x80\x99s then cleared waivers and can be traded.\xc2\xa0Live Feed dan duquetteBaltimore Orioles will take advantage of new 10-day disabled list The Baltimore WireBlue Jays' Bautista called out by Orioles GM Jays JournalDan Duquette continues his one-man crusade against Jose Bautista FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Prioritizing current success or long-term success? The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles could be interested in bringing back Matt Wieters The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles reportedly in contact with outfielder Jose Bautista The Baltimore WireThis is obviously much more risky given the fact that basically the entire league has a shot at the player(s) before the trade can happen. (Incidentally if another team claims the player the original team can pull him back. But if they do not, the claiming team gets the player \xe2\x80\x93 and responsibility for his entire contract.) Most non-contending teams won\xe2\x80\x99t block trades, but often times contending teams will make claims on guys just to block a player from going to a rival.Photo: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsI would submit that Dan Duquette needs to be active during August if the Orioles are going to have a good shot at returning to the post season. Our host network, Fansided, published this article\xc2\xa0last week explaining the process, and offering some players who might see themselves traded through waivers. You\xe2\x80\x99ll notice\xc2\xa0Justin Upton\xe2\x80\x98s name on that list; he\xe2\x80\x99s a guy in whom the Orioles were interested leading up to the non-waiver deadline. Might he still be available?I suspect that San Diego didn\xe2\x80\x99t move Upton because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get an offer that fit in with their view of Upton\xe2\x80\x99s true value. And quite frankly I can\xe2\x80\x99t blame them for that \xe2\x80\x93 as Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s often said, you never want to let other teams undervalue your players. However August is also a time when prices tend to head into the bargain basement on players. First and foremost, there is some risk involved in trading a guy through waivers. However secondly, players like Upton aren\xe2\x80\x99t worth as much as they were prior to last week\xe2\x80\xa6they won\xe2\x80\x99t be on the new team as long.\xc2\xa0More from Rumors1/18 - Baltimore Orioles: Should the Orioles Resign Mark Trumbo?

The reason I singled Upton out on that list is because he\xe2\x80\x99s an outfielder; and the O\xe2\x80\x99s could still use a bit more pop out there. Furthermore the platoon system seems to have moved over to first base, and if the Birds could aquire an additional outfielder of Upton\xe2\x80\x99s caliber, it would probably send Chris Davis\xc2\xa0back to first full time.For those who suggest that the O\xe2\x80\x99s can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to send away any more prospects, I certainly hear your voices. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a slight part of me that agrees with you. However when you have the opportunity to make it to the post season, you have to do what you can do complete the job. Furthermore as I said, August trades normally cost clubs much less in terms of prospects. And that does make a difference.For all intents and purposes, the trade season does end after August 31st. However there\xe2\x80\x99s even a proviso on that as well. Teams can still make trades through waivers in September, although it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen often. Any player that\xe2\x80\x99s traded in September is inelligible to play on a post season roster. So if you think you can find a guy that will help you physically make it to the post season, you can make a trade in September. But if you end up making it, he can\xe2\x80\x99t play once the regular season is over.Next: Baltimore Orioles: Tommy Hunter was part of something specialMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

The win gets the Orioles off to a good start on a critical nine-game west coast swing.The home run for Davis was his 27th for the season. It was also his eighth home run in the past 13 games. Over that stretch he has 22 RBIs, and the Orioles have a record of 8-5.In his time with the Baltimore Orioles, we have seen Chris Davis have these sorts of streaks where he hits multiple home runs and really carries the team over those times. Here are few other such streaks in the past \xe2\x80\xa6The beginning of 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 Davis had the incredible start for the 2013 season. In the first nine games of the year he hit six home runs and had 19 RBIs \xe2\x80\x93 16 in the first four games.June 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 Davis hit seven home runs in nine games, driving in 13 runs.July 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 There was a stretch of four games where Davis hit a home run in each, with eight runs knocked in.End of the 2012 season \xe2\x80\x93 Davis homered in six consecutive games \xe2\x80\x93 a total of seven long balls and 13 RBIs that carried the O\xe2\x80\x99s into the playoffs.In the five stretches mentioned in this article \xe2\x80\x93 four from the past and this current streak \xe2\x80\x93 the Orioles have a combined record of 26-15.

It was known at that time that he had power, though nobody was thinking he would hit quite as many as have come off his bat since then.Davis has hit 123 home runs in victories for his team, with the other 60 in losses. Caleb Joseph, who hit his 18th career home run Monday night, has hit 14 of the 18 in games that the Orioles have won.While looking at Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 home run log, it is interesting to see that of his 183 career home runs, there is no pitcher off whom he has hit more than three round-trippers. Five pitchers have given up three home runs to Crush: Carlos Villanueva, Ervin Santana, Rick Porcello, Phil Coke, and Ivan Nova.Coco Crisp had two hits for the A\xe2\x80\x99s in his first game back since May.

He received plenty of run support from Chris Davis and company en route to a 9-2 victory.Wrapping up the game for the O\xe2\x80\x99s was Mychal Givens, the converted short stop turned relief pitcher with a sidearm delivery.

And he didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly pitch well while in Bowie, either.Yet, on Friday the O\xe2\x80\x99s called up Garcia and sent Mychal Givens back to AA Bowie.

Deep into the 2015 season, Davis has consistently been one of the American League\'s most-feared bats, and as of late, Crushtopher has found a groove reminiscent of his record-breaking 2013.    Chris Davis HRs RBIs SLG% wRC+ OPS   2015 Stats 28 79 .517 131 .847   AL Rank 7th 2nd 9th 15th 15th      Davis has re-established himself with an overwhelming .248/.330/.517 slash line, a hearty slice of retribution after hitting a dismal .196/.300/.404 a year ago. Not only has Davis already hit more home runs (28 in 105 games) than he did a season ago (26 in 127 games), Joe Angel\'s favorite ""big fella"" continues his redemption from an awfully-timed 25-game Adderall suspension last September. Though the O\'s surely could have used Davis in October, the past is the past, and his current rampage in the here and now should soothe any lingering wounds.    Davis\' impending free-agent status has been the talk of widespread debate as to whether the Orioles should indeed make a push to keep him, or tender him a $15M qualifying offer, hope he refuses and take the draft pick compensation. As the O\'s 2015 playoff hopes become more and more unclear, Davis\' importance to the Baltimore lineup has been anything but. The Orioles need Davis, and hopefully Crush realizes he needs Baltimore too.    One of the most impressive aspects of Davis\' resurgence has been his patient at the plate, a facet of his hitting approach that turned into his biggest bugaboo. Power hitters like Davis aren\'t expected to kid themselves into working counts waiting for the perfect pitch, but instead go downs guns-a-blazin\'. Though Davis does lead the AL in strikeouts (135), that\'s always been part of his game. Instead it turns into what he does when it truly does matter, just as he did yesterday afternoon against the Athletics. Top of the 10th, bases loaded in a 3-3 game, Davis followed Adam Jones who popped out to second base in a much-needed RBI situation. In comes Davis, who now faces the pressure of grounding into a double play or failing to execute in the clutch, just like Jones before him. He kicks off the at-bat by taking a first-pitch fastball outside. Arnold Leon does well to drop in a 1-0 curveball for a strike, a pitch that may very well have produced a swing and a miss or weak contact somewhere, especially in a fastball count. Though Davis lays off, and does so again on another curveball outside, working a precious count into his 2-1 favor.    Leon then spots a perfect 2-1 fastball on the outside corner, missing Davis\' bat, and putting himself in the driver\'s seat in a 2-2 count. Leon again makes Davis attempt at a fastball on the outside corner, but Davis doesn\'t bite at a pitch outside of the zone. In a 3-2 count with the bases loaded and one out, Leon has to come over the plate, and Davis knows it, because he manipulated the at-bat back into his control. What he does next, well, is something us O\'s fans have come to chalk down as routine.           <picture class=""c-picture"" data-cid=""site/picture_element-1494652474_1562_19186"" data-cdata=\'{""picture"":true,""dynamic_picture"":false,""convert_picture"":false}\'>            <img srcset=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HCfKmx9fTYgdBE0rn7N1BhIMjng=/0x0:718x404/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945564/LNSo0Z0.0.gif 320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pNQ8zHJegEm8gd0vwMz9kPW_qwI=/0x0:718x404/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945564/LNSo0Z0.0.gif 520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b36QqTE3H6GOpXCedwrJpL7VBGc=/0x0:718x404/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945564/LNSo0Z0.0.gif 720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0PvmTuVcJVV-cHOfdWHGTlN9-3E=/0x0:718x404/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945564/LNSo0Z0.0.gif 920w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzmyGdBdWhNPqXgN5GPNqA9D4ho=/0x0:718x404/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945564/LNSo0Z0.0.gif 1120w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z-Ek4w7LlyHzlsZuceN9CVVFXHk=/0x0:718x404/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945564/LNSo0Z0.0.gif 1320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Io6lhwRln7fUCrJl7SImDsDf23A=/0x0:718x404/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945564/LNSo0Z0.0.gif 1520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n-9KYL_rykkvwlk86cjTjD6kiD8=/0x0:718x404/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945564/LNSo0Z0.0.gif 1720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4324BUYnQYpb7GXoIeBhZwW0eMA=/0x0:718x404/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945564/LNSo0Z0.0.gif 1920w"" sizes=""(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2nd46vYOzRYyiFdnkoChY6miqGg=/0x0:718x404/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945564/LNSo0Z0.0.gif"">  </picture>          The best part of this swing is that Davis wasn\'t looking to hook the baseball or cheat on it, knowing he is likely to get a fastball somewhere near the plate. Instead, he lets the ball travel and uncorks a grand slam in a part of the O.co Coliseum that only a handful of left-handers can reach. But, most importantly, it was all made possible because he stayed within himself at a time when the Orioles needed him the most. A sacrifice fly or any sort of RBI production would have sufficed, but Crush went above and beyond, as did the baseball. Saint Crushtopher not only showed it yesterday, but his patience at the plate has been a year long odyssey.       Chris Davis Plate Discipline O-Swing% O-Contact% Zone% SwStr%   2012 39.8% 56.0% 40.0% 15.6%   2013 35.7% 55.1% 39.8% 15.2%   2014 31.6% 49.1% 41.1% 15.5%   2015 29.8% 53.4% 42.0% 14.7%      As Fangraphs\' wonderful data shows, Davis\' is doing his best to not swing at pitches out of the zone, which is forcing more pitches into the strike zone (as indicated by a 42.0% zone percentage, which calculates pitches seen over the plate). Seeing more strikes has kept a career-best 14.7% swinging strike rate consistently down, allowing baseball\'s 11th-best hard hit rate of 39.3% to take over. It\'s convenient to say, in a contract year, that Davis is doing this all to break the bank after the season is finished, but the strides he\'s made as a batter were not easy habits to break, considering his past and his desire to restore his reputation in the clubhouse. Speaking of the clubhouse, there never seemed to be any sort of discourse or angst from Davis after moving from first base, where he is a Gold Glove caliber defender, to the outfield. The transition from a more stationery position to a big league corner outfield spot is not one to take lightly. That change of position, to me, shows that he truly is a clubhouse favorite that believes in the philosophy the Orioles regime has spilled into the dugout. Davis seems to be well-liked amongst his teammates, and it shows in his team-player attitude. He\'s a Buck Showalter kind of guy. Among soon-to-be free agents, Davis is extremely lucky to enter a year in which only Justin Upton and Yoenis Cespedes present the same kind of bop that Crush does, and both of them play in the outfield. Davis\' availability as a lefty, corner infielder will make him a hot commodity, especially if he continues on his torrid pace.    For the Orioles, a team that faces to lose notables Steve Pearce, Gerardo Parra, Wei-Yin Chen, Darren O\'Day and Matt Wieters, the reclamation of some stability would serve well for a team that is in the midst of what could be an uncertain future. Whether or not a deal for Davis can be made is still up in the air, but the Orioles will have the first crack at a 29, soon to be 30 year-old slugger that has produced no less than 26 HRs and 72 RBIs in his three-plus seasons in Baltimore, is showing a savvy new approach at the plate and fits the Orioles mold. In an era of has-beens switching area codes for the big-money deal, it only seems right that Davis doesn\'t take the chance. He\'s a fan-favorite here with an attitude that fits a ballclub that\'s hard not to love (only when they aren\'t hitting then do I start questioning my faith), and the Orioles need a guy that has the capability of creating earthquakes on Eutaw Street.

Toronto Blue Jays defeated Baltimore Orioles 12-5. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsHelping the Baltimore Orioles to accomplish nine wins in the past 12 games has been the progression of Jonathan Schoop and Caleb Joseph. Each has been great with the glove and arm, and their offensive contributions have been effective as well.Right now, Schoop is hitting .299 on 32-for-107 on the season, contributing seven home runs and 15 RBIs. Since his return from the extended injury rehab, he is batting .313.\xc2\xa0 And over the past five games he is 9-for-17.A couple of weeks ago I had written an article on the topic of whether Schoop had the possible upside potential to become the next Manny Machado as he gains similar cumulative experience. My answer to the question was that, yes, this is very possible. The opinion generated some negative response, with one commenter saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI guarantee Schoop will hit .220 for the 30 games following his return. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why Buck likes him so much except for defense.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I hope this fellow does not work in the industry of giving investment advice.

The Baseball-Reference.com site takes any number of games you highlight and then annualizes those numbers over a 162-game season. These stats for Joseph would give him 59 homers and 192 RBIs!\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes, sample size \xe2\x80\xa6 but the point being made here is to simply talk about that sample time to say that he is really playing well.With Matt Wieters almost surely moving on elsewhere after this season, could Joseph be a worthy replacement as the first-string catcher? Again, the sample size is small, though it could be argued that it will get better for Joseph as he gains more experience. But Joseph hits a home run once in every 29 plate appearances, Wieters does so once in every 30. I think most people would expect that Wieters had much more power by comparison.There is much more to be considered for a catcher than simply power numbers, but Caleb Joseph has done well. And he has especially performed well defensively. There is not much of a drop-off relative to Wieters, and some might argue for certain stats to be better and for certain pitchers to actually prefer Caleb.Statistics can be all over the place on Wieters, as evidenced by the confusing nature of his left/right splits which we detailed previously. But it would not seem that he is effective as a designated hitter. The sample size on this is not terribly small \xe2\x80\x94 40 games \xe2\x80\x94 and he is batting a mere .200 as a DH. By comparison it is .261 as the catcher.Next: Looking back at the six career grand slams of Chris DavisNext: Ravens: Too many wide receiver injuriesMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"
08/08/2015,"[('Orioles 4, Angels 8: Halos tee off on Orioles pitching ...', "" Kevin Gausman's last two starts were okay, but tonight he didn't have his fastball command and the Angels made him pay for it. After a fairly quiet top of the first, Gausman struck out David DeJesus and Kole Calhoun before surrendering a solo shot to Mike Trout (on his birthday no less!) to make it 1-0 Angels. Pujols then singled against the Orioles' defensive shift, but David Murphy grounded out to end the inning. After the Orioles failed to score in the top of the second half, Gausman looked okay in the bottom half.    In the top of the third, the Orioles broke through a bit against Angels starter Andrew Heaney. Heaney is a highly touted pitcher drafted ninth overall by the Marlins in 2012. (Yes, that would be five spots after Gausman was drafted the same year.) He was traded to the Dodgers late last year in the Dee Gordon deal and then was immediately flipped to the Angels for Howie Kendrick straight up. At that point he became, according to Baseball America, the Angels' number one prospect and the 42nd-ranked prospect in the game. Anyway, Nolan Reimold singled against Heaney to lead off the third inning. Third baseman Conor Gillaspie had to dive for the ball and stand up and throw, but Reimold was too fast. Manny Machado popped out, but Gerardo Parra singled to the right fielder Calhoun. Reimold turned on the jets as he rounded second base, but Calhoun threw him out by several steps. Thankfully, Parra took second base on the throw. I say thankfully because the next batter was Adam Jones who singled off the center-field wall to tie the game at one. Trout make a strong throw to nail Jones at second base. The ball was hit so well, Jones probably thought had a homer and didn't run as fast as he usually does. That ended the inning, but at least the Orioles had tied it up. Gausman responded with a 1-2-3 bottom half, and the Orioles took a 3-1 lead in the 4th on a two-run dinger by Jonathan Schoop that rocketed down the left-field line. (Don't look now, but Schoop has a 154 wRC+ this year.) But Gausman walked Trout and Pujols back-to-back to start his inning. David Murphy then blooped a single over Machado's head to score Trout, who in addition to blasting home runs and making highlight-reel catches is a very good baserunner. Pujols moved to second on the play and then, after Erick Aybar flew out, moved to second when Gillaspie grounded out. The next batter, Johnny Giovatella, doubled him home to tie the game at 3. Chris Ianetta flew out to end the inning.    The fifth inning came and went pretty quickly, save for a Gerardo Parra single and Adam Jones getting angry at home plate umpire Phil Cuzzi for calling him out on a checked-swing third strike. The Orioles took the lead (again!) in the sixth inning though, when Matt Wieters knocked a one-out solo shot to left-center. That put the Orioles up 4-3, all while broadcasters Gary Thorne and Jim Palmer were talking about how well Wieters hits at Angel Stadium. After J.J. Hardy grounded out, the Orioles had a chance for more when Schoop singled and new Oriole Junior Lake doubled off the third base bag.    It was at this point that Angels manager Mike Scioscia replaced Heaney on the mound with Fernando Salas, bringing in a righty to pitch to Nolan Reimold. On a 1-1 pitch, Reimold popped a ball into foul territory. Giovatella had to run over to make the play and gloved the ball but dropped it to give Reimold another chance. Unfortunately, he used that opportunity to strike out looking, leaving two runners in scoring position. Those runners would come back to haunt the Orioles in the 6th. It didn't start off badly. David Murphy led off and poked a single through the 5.5 hole, just off the end of his bat. Aybar slammed a long fly ball to center field that Adam Jones had to run straight back and get, then Gillaspie popped out.    That's when things unraveled. Giovatella singled on an 0-2 curveball that caught too much of the plate. Gausman then got Chris Ianetta to 0-2 before getting him to foul off two pitches and then take ball one. On the 1-2 pitch, Gausman grooved a fastball and Ianetta didn't miss it, doubling to deep center field and scoring both runners. The Angels had the lead, 5-4, and they wouldn't let it go the rest of the night. Chaz Roe came in to replace Gausman and gave up a sharp single to DeJesus that scored Ianetta, making it 6-4 Angels. Kole Calhoun also singled, and Roe walked Mike Trout to bring up Pujols, who thankfully popped out to end the inning. The Orioles would get a few more baserunners but would not threaten again the rest of the game. Buck brought in Brian Matusz to pitch the 7th, who retired Murphy but gave up a single to Aybar. When pinch-hitter C.J. Cron was announced, Brad Brach entered the game to get the favorable righty-righty matchup. But some times not even those work out in your favor, as Cron hammered a 93 MPH middle-in fastball into the seats to increase the Angels lead to 8-4.    And that was basically the game. The Angels had a couple more baserunners, and Manny Machado doubled in the top of the 9th to complete a 3-5 night at the plate. Gerardo Parra went 2-4. The loss drops the Orioles to 55-53 and pushes them further down in the Wild Card standings, atop which the Angels currently sit. Toronto occupies the second spot, and they won tonight too.

There are a lot of games that are, let\'s face it, run-of-the-mill affairs. You see one of them and you\'ve seen them all, in a way. The Orioles and Angels did not play one of these games on Saturday night. It was a strange one from start to finish, and luckily for the O\'s, most of the strange happenings worked out in their favor as they shut out Los Angeles/Anaheim, 5-0.    Ubaldo Jimenez no-hit the Angels through 5.2 innings and pitched eight scoreless innings and this was probably only the fourth-strangest thing about the game. There were multiple runs taken off the board due to replay challenges at the plate, there was a home run caught by a reliever, Chris Davis stealing a base and Manny Machado failing to steal one, and surely the grand-daddy of them all, Matt Wieters effectively getting a double out of a little nubber hit to second base. What the heck? No, it\'s all real. PROTIP: When sliding into home, actually touch home Though Jimenez carried his no-hitter into the sixth inning, he actually lost the perfect game with a hit batsman on the very first batter of the game. That was David DeJesus. Oh, great, you had to think right away - THAT Ubaldo showed up. Yet much like you should never judge a book by its cover, you should also not judge a starting pitcher solely by his first inning. I mean, you know, unless it really sucked, but Jimenez only faced four batters, so that\'s fine. The Orioles had themselves a little rally in the second inning and it looked like they were going to get on the scoreboard in that inning. Jonathan Schoop hit a one out single. Schoop fired up the jets on a J.J. Hardy double, helmet flying off as he hoofed it around third base. Many times, third base coach Bobby Dickerson sends a runner and you\'re screaming ""NO!"" at the television. This was not one of those sends.    The sliding Schoop beat the ball to the plate and was initially ruled safe, but a replay showed that Schoop somehow managed to slide towards home plate with his left foot in the air, never touching home plate, while his right leg dragged on the ground and stopped just shy of home plate, so the catcher\'s tag did actually get him before he touched the plate. The call was overturned. It was another one of those moments that made you think, what ELSE can go wrong with this team right now?    The lesson from The Crow  Here is the lesson: It can\'t rain all the time. Not even when the Orioles manage to seem like they\'re disappointing you by only getting one run out of a first-and-third, nobody out situation - and that one run came not from a base hit but from an RBI fielder\'s choice. That gave the O\'s a 1-0 lead in the third inning. As it turned out, that was the only run they would need the whole night. Ubaldo\'s partial no-hitter kind of snuck up on you, which probably had something to do with the fact that he had a few early baserunners thanks to the HBP, a third inning walk, and a fourth inning Manny Machado error, but in spite of all of that, after each inning the scoreboard popped up with a zero under the hit column for the Angels.    Meanwhile, the Orioles were adding to their run total. Machado atoned for his error by smashing a home run into the O\'s bullpen the very next half-inning. That homer was his 24th of the season, which is good for a tie for 13th in MLB. Not too shabby. Darren O\'Day caught the home run\xc2\xa0with a glove that was on his right hand. I haven\'t figured it out yet either. An inning later, after Jimenez set the Angels down 1-2-3 in the fifth, Wieters had his weird moment. With Chris Davis on second base after a leadoff double, Wieters rolled over on a ball and grounded it towards second, as he tends to do when batting lefty. But he busted it down the line (as much as he can) and the ball rolled into enough of a no-man\'s land that the pitcher had to cover. Angels starter Garrett Richards caught the ball and failed to actually touch first base. Following this, the entire Angels infield stopped paying attention to Wieters, who noticed this and then dashed for second base, sliding in easily ahead of a wild throw and tag attempt. Richards was charged with an error for the catch on the play, but we all know what really happened.\xc2\xa0Matt Wieters got an infield double, and it was awesome.    This sequence ended up with the O\'s getting their third run of the game when Schoop plated Davis with a sacrifice fly. Davis actually successfully touched home. Bob Milacki et al pop open the champagne bottles Jimenez lost the no-hitter with two outs in the sixth inning when Kole Calhoun doubled. There have now been 8,792 days since the last Orioles no-hitter. Ubaldo, however, still went on to have a great game, the kind of game the Orioles desperately needed from him after recent rotation struggles. He came out for the eighth having already thrown over 100 pitches, but Buck Showalter never wavered in his faith for his starter and Jimenez set down the Angels in order, 1-2-3. The final line for Jimenez over eight innings was no runs on two hits and a walk, plus two hit batters. He struck out six, throwing 118 pitches, 76 of which were strikes. That is Good Ubaldo - and he got some good Orioles offense as a reward. The Orioles ended up with five runs. Three of them scored on plays where an out was made. Two were the result of home runs. They went 2-10 with RISP in the game, plating no runs on either of the two hits. It was weird, but when you get things like Davis walking and then stealing a base to get into scoring position, well, that\'s weird too. That happened in the eighth inning, taking the game out of save situation range, when Schoop once again drove in Davis with a sac fly. Last, but certainly not least, Caleb Joseph punctuated the night the best way he knows how, by ensuring that his young child will eat. Walker Joseph has gotta eat, all know, and his dad knows it more than anyone. The elder Joseph also hit a home run into the O\'s bullpen, his 10th of the year. He is now batting a downright respectable .258/.329/.452 for the season.    Out of save range, the ninth inning ended up being O\'Day\'s inning, and it too was weird, because O\'Day didn\'t look so great. He gave up three hits, but lucky for him and us, after allowing back-to-back singles to Mike Trout and Albert Pujols, O\'Day got David Murphy to hit a not-deep fly ball to Adam Jones. Trout tagged and headed for home on the play and at first he was ruled safe. On further inspection, Trout made like Schoop earlier in the game, sliding over the plate before he touched it. Joseph tagged him out while Trout\'s foot was still in the air. Whoops! The Angels were down to their last out just like that, and although Erick Aybar added a single as well, the tying run got no closer than in the hole for them. The Zach Britton jets were not scrambled. Thanks to all of the runs they added on through the game, the Orioles didn\'t have to sweat it. The O\'s winning combined with a Blue Jays win earlier on Saturday means that Toronto now has the top wild card spot. The Angels would be the road wild card team. The Orioles are the closest team out of it, two games behind. They\'ll have a chance to pull a game closer in the rubber game of this series tomorrow afternoon, that is, if they can manage to do anything at all against the junkball of Jered Weaver.

08/11/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Little Things That Pile Up', 'Perhaps it was because it was a West Coast game and 1:00 in the morning that it seemed like the bottom of the ninth inning between the Baltimore Orioles and Seattle Mariners went on and on and on.Or perhaps that half inning did go on and on and on, and it would have felt like that at 9:30 Eastern time.Yes, it was the latter of those. And this inning was, in a way, a microcosm of a season that is just a bit short here and there \xe2\x80\x94 an extra run not scored or an extra run allowed, the ground ball that was hit stupidly against the O\xe2\x80\x99s defensive shift, the bloop that fell in, the third strike not called, etc. \xe2\x80\x94 that have piled up over this season.Clinging to a 3-1 lead going into the final half inning, Zach Britton was being called upon to get a five-out save. Fortunately, it was not another one-run game. The O\xe2\x80\x99s aren\xe2\x80\x99t so good with them this year (15-18), and they were just 4-7 when scoring three runs. The third run had come in the sixth inning off the bat of the new Ron Burgundy look-alike also known as Chris Davis.

This should be no problem.But you knew there was something amiss and not going to go well when the second pitch resulted in a Nelson Cruz ground ball to J.J. Hardy that he misplayed into only his second error of the season. But justice seemed to be served when three pitches later, Robinson Cano hit into a double play. It was now 17 pitches total for Britton with only one out to go.Three pitches later it is 1-2 on Franklin Guitierrez. The game is almost done! But Guitierrez barely flicks fouls on the next two pitches \xe2\x80\x94 a 98-mph fastball and a 86-mph slider. Ball two is then followed by two more fouls, including a 99-mph fastball. Finally, on the 10th pitch, Guitierrez doubles over Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 head.Five pitches into an Austin Jackson at-bat (including a passed ball by Caleb Joseph that allows Cruz to third base), he has already fouled off three Britton offerings. He swings and misses a final strike! End of game!?!\xc2\xa0 No, it is another passed ball; Cruz scores and Jackson goes to first base.\xc2\xa0It took Jesus coming to the plate to put an end to this game!Finally, it takes Jesus to come to the rescue of the Baltimore Orioles!\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jesus Montero, who thankfully strikes out on three pitches. Thank you Jesus; thank you Jesus!Britton\xe2\x80\x99s 28th save took a total of 36 pitches, 28 for strikes. That is the most he has thrown all year, so he won\xe2\x80\x99t be available this evening.This string of little things that pile up could therefore conceivably continue even into this evening\xe2\x80\x99s game. Imagine a close scenario where Britton is needed at the end to win it, but he is not available because of the previous game\xe2\x80\x99s extended outing. Truly, at this juncture of the season, EVERY pitch counts and every little event has meaning.I love the Baltimore Orioles and have done so probably for about as long as any two of you reading this combined. But there is just something about this particular team that is lacking in the category of finishing off opponents and burying them when the opportunity is present. Wins are too difficult and losses are too easy.

You no longer ask yourself if the Blue Jays (61-52) will catch the Yankees, but when it will happen. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s why their three-game series at the Rogers Centre against the Yankees beginning Friday is already are sold out, with folks scrambling to watch the Blue Jays perhaps move into first place for good.

He has long been one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s biggest power brokers, and was the president and chief operating officer of Major League Baseball for five years, helping centralize the ultra-lucrative Major League Baseball Advance Media rights.The Blue Jays, after a messy public-relations fiasco last winter when they privately courted White Sox president Ken Williams and Baltimore Orioles GM Dan Duquette to be Beeston\xe2\x80\x99s successor, announced before the season this would be Beeston\xe2\x80\x99s final year.

It was Beeston who constantly encouraged him, willing to increase payroll, and letting him become as aggressive as he wanted during the trade deadline. And it\xe2\x80\x99s Beeston now who\xe2\x80\x99s giving every ounce of credit to Anthopoulos and his staff for the shrewd moves that landed David Price, Troy Tulowitzki, LaTroy Hawkins and Ben Revere.\xe2\x80\x9cIt almost feels like fantasy baseball,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Beeston said. \xe2\x80\x9cWho do you want?

08/12/2015,"[('Orioles-Mariners Preview \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Many of Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s top sluggers are doing their best to try to push the Orioles to their third playoff trip in four years. That effort may be all for naught if the starting rotation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become more consistent. The Orioles hope Kevin Gausman can help get the staff on track Wednesday against the Seattle Mariners. Baltimore (57-55) lost 6-5 in 10 innings Tuesday, missing a chance to gain ground on the Los Angeles Angels, who own a two-game lead over the Orioles for the second AL wild-card spot, but also lost. The Orioles have 20 homers and 22 doubles over their last 12 games, with Chris Davis batting .364 with seven home runs and 18 RBIs. Jonathan Schoop is batting .364 in that span, while Manny Machado is at .358. Despite hitting .235, Adam Jones has 11 RBIs. Davis and Jones hit back-to-back homers in the eighth inning to rally the Orioles and help overcome a poor start by Chris Tillman, who gave up five runs in 2 1-3 innings. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s rotation owns a 6.02 ERA during this 6-6 stretch, and its starters have lasted 4 2-3 innings or fewer five times. The Orioles could be without another hot bat in Matt Wieters after he left in the third inning with a strained hamstring and was replaced by Caleb Joseph. Wieters, who missed 181 games from 2014-15 after undergoing Tommy John surgery, was hitting .383 in his last 13 after going 1 for 2 Tuesday. Joseph is batting .333 over his last 14. Manager Buck Showalter is taking a cautious approach with his catcher and likely will rest him for this game ahead of an off day Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cIt tightened up a bit, then it got worse as the game went on,\xe2\x80\x9d Wieters told MLB\xe2\x80\x99s official website. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we caught it before anything would be serious.\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman (2-3, 4.56 ERA) might need lots of help from Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s bats if his road struggles continue. He\xe2\x80\x99s 0-3 with an 8.41 ERA in four games and had another tough outing Friday against the Angels, surrendering six runs and a career high-matching nine hits over 6 2-3 innings in an 8-4 defeat. But for all of his problems away from home this year, he fared well in his only previous start at Seattle, giving up one run over 6 2-3 innings in a 2-1, 10-inning victory July 25, 2014. Robinson Cano, who is hitting .364 in his last eight games, is 4 for 6 against Gausman. Nelson Cruz exited in the seventh inning due to neck spasms, but not before extending his hitting streak to a major league season high-matching 21 games for the Mariners (53-61). Cruz, who hit his major league-leading 34th homer, is batting .411 with 13 homers during that run. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just kind of stiff, the neck,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnybody can get that. I was sitting there and I felt the cramps.\xe2\x80\x9d Hisashi Iwakuma (3-2, 4.41) is 3-1 with a 3.00 ERA over his last six starts, completing at least seven innings four times. He\xe2\x80\x99s had trouble this year after logging high pitch counts, however, and Seattle hopes that trend doesn\xe2\x80\x99t continue after he threw a career-high 118 in Friday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-3 win against Texas. He allowed a combined right runs over 11 1-3 innings in his two starts immediately following his previous 100-pitch outings this year. Iwakuma is 0-2 with a 3.66 ERA in three starts against Baltimore, getting one run of support in 19 2-3 innings.

His 15 home runs rank him 7th in the International League, and his .271 average can be filed away under the \xe2\x80\x9cpretty darn good\xe2\x80\x9d category.\xc2\xa0Live Feed dariel alvarezBaltimore Orioles Have Decision to Make on Dariel Alvarez The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles and Collection of Corner Outfielders The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Down on the Farm The Baltimore WireReviewing the AL East 2015 Projections: Right Field The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles' Minor Leagues Enjoy Success The Baltimore WireDariel Alvarez to join the Baltimore Orioles The Baltimore WireIn fact, while Manny Machado was going yard at the professional home run derby, Dariel Alvarez was in Omaha, Nebraska where he WON the AAA version of the event.So let\xe2\x80\x99s recap.Hitting for Average: checkHitting for Power: checkDefense: checkMajor League Name: even that deserves\xc2\xa0fat ol\xe2\x80\x99 checkYou may seem confused that Dariel Alvarez has yet to\xc2\xa0appear with the Orioles this season. Yet, Alvarez has a very transparent weakness. He cannot take a walk.In the MLB, the league average for the walk percentage statistic\xc2\xa0is 7.5%. Dariel Alvarez has walked in only\xc2\xa03.08% of his plate appearances this season. And that\xe2\x80\x99s in the MINOR LEAGUES.This is not to say that pitchers in AAA are terrible, but how do we expect him to improve this stat in the major leagues?In the pros, a pitcher will make you look silly if he realizes that you do not know your way around the strike zone. I think Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 GM Dan Duquette is well-aware of this.To further this argument is the fact that Alvarez finds himself lugging around a poor .300 OBP. It is one thing to have an on base percentage like this when you\xe2\x80\x99re hitting in the low .200\xe2\x80\x99s, but Alvarez has an average that is just 29 points lower than his OBP.This may be confusing if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t a stat guru, so let\xe2\x80\x99s put this into perspective.\xc2\xa0Nolan Reimold and Travis Snider have an\xc2\xa0OBP higher than .300 in THE PROS this season.Not good news for Alvarez.If you\xe2\x80\x99ve followed the O\xe2\x80\x99s this season, you know that plate discipline is something that has haunted the team, with first-pitch pop-outs and three-pitch K\xe2\x80\x99s writing the script for a large number of their losses.I like Alvarez, and I think his high power and moderate\xc2\xa0average could allow him to be a scaled-down version of\xc2\xa0Chris Davis starting in 2016 or 2017.

There were signs of progression during the arduous nine-game West Coast circuit, but yet again, the inconsistent nature of an average team bursted what could\'ve been a game-changing bubble.    The O\'s kicked off the oh-so important road trip with a decisive 9-2 win over a not-very-good Athletics team. Spot starter Tyler Wilson dazzled in his first major league win as a starting pitcher, going 7.2 innings allowing only two runs with three strikeouts. The Oriole lineup collected 14 hits, notched an early lead, and didn\'t look back. It was the kind of win fans could only wish for to begin what is an annual anxiety-filled stretch. But, as is typical for the Orioles, a no-name starter some refer to as Chris Bassitt carved up the Baltimore lineup the next night, as the O\'s fell 5-0. ""Orioles Magic"" ensued in the rubber game in Oakland, thanks to a 10th inning Chris Davis grand slam, who capped a comeback of six unanswered runs in the 7-3 win. In a sector of the United States where it\'s more important to win series than dream of three-consecutive sweeps, the Orioles did alright by taking two of three from a team they very much were better than. However, the 2015 version of the Orioles showed their true colors in Anaheim and Seattle. Leading 3-1 after 3.5 innings in the opener of the Angels\' series, starting pitcher Kevin Gausman was tagged for two runs immediately after Jonathan Schoop staked him to a two-run lead, and in the 6th, the young fireballing righty failed to win a precious high-leverage battle with the .184 batting Chris Iannetta, who sent a two-out, two-strike double to left field, giving the Halos a 5-4 lead. The O\'s would lose 8-4.    Ubaldo Jimenez brought back the optimism in a 5-0 win the next night, stifling the Angels for 8.0 innings. The O\'s found the gaps with four doubles and sent two souvenirs into the stands, courtesy of Manny Machado and Caleb Joseph. It was the kind of game that reminded Birdland what Buck Showalter\'s brand of Orioles\' baseball looked like.    Though, as has been with this brand of baseball all year, the fun was short-lived. The rubber match in Anaheim saw the O\'s down 4-2 in the 6th inning, but a pair of solo home runs from Gerardo Parra and Davis quickly brought Birdland out of the doldrums. It wasn\'t meant to be, however. A walk-off single from David Murphy with two outs, bases loaded and in a 3-2 count continued the Orioles trend of ""not quite enough"".    The Mariners series was more of the same. The O\'s won the opener with solid starting pitching, the long ball and Zach Britton shutting a slightly open door to win 3-2. Showalter\'s squad rallied late in the second game, despite a very poor showing from Chris Tillman, squaring things up 5-5 in the 8th, as Adam Jones and the big fella combined for two home runs and three RBIs in the 8th inning, tying the game at 5-5. Again, and as it seems to be this season, the stars were not in alignment. TJ McFarland saw a bloop double and Baltimore chop result in 1st and 3rd with no outs in the bottom of the 10th, with Austin Jackson roping a single to right field that narrowly dropped on the foul line, giving the O\'s the 6-5 loss. The peak of the Orioles demise was on full display yesterday afternoon, as Hishasi Iwakuma constantly forced the O\'s into quick 0-2 counts, changed speeds, hit his spots and disallowed the Baltimore bats to find the sweet spot, cruising not only to his first ML complete game, but to his first career no-hitter. The mantra of ""not quite enough"" has marred what could have been yet the continuation of a string of overly successful seasons since 2012. That year, the O\'s rode a statistic-defying wave of magic, reminding fans what kind of town Baltimore is and how badly the city was dying for a winner. Last year, the Orioles were simply better than everyone else, and were kept out of the World Series by a Royals team whose unprecedented surge was probably the only anomaly that could have been the Orioles\' downfall.    Now, the Orioles are average, and are playing as such. Perhaps asking Bud Norris and Steve Pearce to repeat career-years was too much. The likelihood of Travis Snider, Alejandro De Aza and Delmon Young replicating the losses of Nelson Cruz and Nick Markakis wasn\'t farfetched, but sometimes experiments fail. Maybe, just maybe, stashing a 22 year-old relief pitcher in the bullpen who pitches as often as Chris Davis wasn\'t the best idea in a season filled with expectations. Average players producing average results, such as David Lough, Ryan Flaherty, Nolan Reimold, and Jimmy Paredes, shouldn\'t be much of a surprise, but the Orioles are now dealing with the 7-2 hand they dealt themselves, and only the 25 men that wear the orange and black can find a way to turn it around. And unfortunately, that time is now. The Blue Jays look they\'re never going to lose again, and the Yankees, though slumping, have been one of the more consistent teams in baseball all year. With 49 games left, the Orioles are in an unenviable position, but one that has been overcome before. Can the platoon of Lough, Reimold and Junior Lake do just enough on offense? Are the starters poised to go just deep enough into games to give a bullpen that has done more than enough a little time off? Will someone other than Davis and Manny Machado decide to take enough of the offensive load and spread the production?    Because enough is enough, as the Orioles are slowly fading into a frustrating winter. It\'s make or break time.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
08/14/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Trying to Explain a .500 Season So Far', 'Aug 10, 2015; Seattle, WA, USA; Baltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones (10) stands on the field during the national anthem before a game against the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field. Baltimore defeated Seattle, 3-2/ Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles enter today into a four-game set at home against the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s. The Western road trip with a 4-5 record leaves the Orioles at 57-56 on the season, facing a final 49 games. The O\xe2\x80\x99s could still put a big close on the season and get into the playoffs, etc., etc. But the fact is that right now in the middle of August they are essentially a .500 team.This is not what we thought we were going to see in 2015. Remember the offense taken by O\xe2\x80\x99s fans and writers when so many \xe2\x80\x9cexperts\xe2\x80\x9d out there in the broader baseball world predicted the Birds to be a .500 sort of team and finish in the middle of the pack? How could they say this about a team that had the entire starting rotation returning from a 96-win season?It pretty much comes down to two trains of thought to explain this mediocrity. It is either the failure of the ownership/management to build a sufficient winning roster, or the players on the roster are significantly underperforming relative to expectations.The Insufficient Roster TheoryThis of course relates to three players in particular who were not re-signed after strong 2014 results: Nick Markakis, Nelson Cruz and Andrew Miller. Each of the three have had fine seasons again this year, although Cruz and Markakis are on teams in far worse condition than the Orioles relative to playoff aspirations.

It is the corner outfield and DH spots in the lineup that have not been replaced sufficiently.Without doubt, no player given a chance to take a regular corner outfield or DH position has risen to \xe2\x80\x9ctake\xe2\x80\x9d it. The cast of characters has been immense, and to name a few: Alejandro De Aza, Travis Snider, Chris Parmelee, Delmon Young, Nolan Reimold, David Lough, Jimmy Paredes; and even the highly-touted Gerardo Parra is only .196 since joining the Birds. Chris Davis has more recently been sent to the outfield to attempt to address the problem.How bad are the numbers?\xc2\xa0 For left field it is particularly dismal, as the Orioles are only getting a .198 average from that position, which is the worst in the league. Right field is much better, perhaps surprisingly so, as a .281 average is third in the league. For DH, the situation is more in the middle of the pack. The Orioles rank ninth in the league with a .252 average, whereas the league average is .261.I believe it was a reasonable expectation that one from the list of players above would have stepped up enough to have a strong season. But none have. They were not going to replicate a 2014 Nelson Cruz power year, but surely they should have done better than what has happened.The Underperforming Players TheoryNot every last player on any team is going to have a top 10% production career-year at the same time. But a winning outfit needs a sizeable number of players to do just that in order to carry the team to the top of the standings.Without doubt, there have been some poor performances in 2015. It is great that Chris Davis has heated up considerably to be among the home run and RBI leaders in the league. But he was pretty absent early in the year. J.J. Hardy is simply not having a great offensive year by any measure other than clutch hits, and that seems to be diminishing as well. Matt Wieters has not come back strong enough to give consistent contributions. Steve Pearce is not the same person as a year ago. And Ryan Flaherty is \xe2\x80\xa6 well, you know \xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99ve jumped on him enough; but he has sadly again proven my point.Relative to pitchers, it is great to have Ubaldo Jimenez living up to expectations, but Bud Norris was a total disaster, while Chris Tillman hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a top-drawer starter other than for a very short and recent window of time. Chen is improved, but Miguel Gonzalez is getting hit harder of late and has been inconsistent.The Combination TheoryIt is a combination of both elements. I am no Duquette defender, but I do lay the greater blame on the lack of performance from those who reasonably had a solid enough career resume to have played much better.Looking back, the Orioles needed at least one corner outfielder who could have performed above the league average.\xc2\xa0 There is no doubt now that having Markakis or Cruz would had made the Orioles a better 2015 team with a better record. However, the issue of evaluating whether the four-year contracts were wise to be rejected has to play out over a longer time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the four years are going to prove to be worth the money given to either player. One of these players might have pushed the O\xe2\x80\x99s high enough to have made the Wild Card Playoffs, but then the team might have been one and out, and the Orioles would be stuck with a long-term, bad contract.I still lay the greater percentage of the blame on the players not performing, maybe about 75 to 25% versus the roster not being re-built. This roster should be well better than 57-56, that is for sure.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"
08/15/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Shifts, bloops, and bunts - Birds Watcher', 'The Baltimore Orioles employ a lot of infield shifts during games \xe2\x80\x93 as much if not more than anyone in baseball. With that said, as yourself if that in and of itself isn\xe2\x80\x99t hurting them in ways that are unseen or unknown. Obviously some hitters are able to successfully hit against the shift here and there, and that includes several Orioles.

Heck, the Kansas City Royals blooped their way to an American League Championship over the O\xe2\x80\x99s last year. And last night we saw Oakland use two infield singles to get a rally cooking in the ninth against the O\xe2\x80\x99s.

Last night there was a flailing pop which would have normally been a fairly routine play for Manny Machado. He was able to deflect the ball with the tip of his glove, but it ticked away. Machado had shifted around into the shortstop position, and had to glide all the way back over to the line.Luckily that didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt the Orioles, however the point is that the shifts can often turn routine plays into fluky things which can often cost teams games. Even in the ninth inning; the O\xe2\x80\x99s were playing your typical \xe2\x80\x9cno doubles defense,\xe2\x80\x9d which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even take into account that a guy could get on base with an infield single.

However while he advanced to third on a sacrifice, the O\xe2\x80\x99s recorded two quick outs. Gerardo Parra was then hit by a pitch to put runners at the corners. That\xe2\x80\x99s when things began to swing back in the right direction for the Orioles. Adam Jones took a strike, and then he proceeded to smack a deep shot into the Baltimore night. When it landed it the grandstand, the O\xe2\x80\x99s had cut the lead to 4-3 and were right back in the game.Jones would also add a sac fly-RBI in the last of the seventh, which brought Chris Davis up to bat with a runner on second.

The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 inability to defend against fluky plays reared it\xe2\x80\x99s ugly head once again, as the first two Oakland hitters got on base due to infield hits. Pinch-hitter Josh Phegley\xe2\x80\x98s fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice-RBI allowed one run to score to cut the lead to 6-5.

And as much as I wrote about the Birds being at a disadvantage during the west coast trip in terms of being so far away from their affiliates, the same is now true of Oakland.

And he already had a runner in scoring position at that.And perhaps it was fitting that the \xe2\x80\x9cMucho Man,\xe2\x80\x9d Manny Machado, would then just decide to end the game with a two-run homer on a 1-1 count. I mean, what the heck \xe2\x80\x93 right?! While it took longer than one would have expected, this was a game that the Orioles couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lost. And they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. The Birds now find themselves five games out of first, and only two back for the wild card.Bear in mind that Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen was already at a disadvantage coming into the game last night, and now after being taxed in a game like that things look even worse for them \xe2\x80\x93 and they\xe2\x80\x99re a world away from their minor league affiliates.

08/16/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Is Toronto really that good?', 'The Baltimore Orioles are currently battling both Toronto and New York for play off positioning. Heck, they\xe2\x80\x99ve basically been doing so all season long. (Some might argue that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been battling Toronto since last off season\xe2\x80\x99s Dan Duquette battle, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a different story.) Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s been the flavor of the month since re-working their roster at the trade deadline. But are they as good as advertised overall?Make no mistake about the fact that Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s a good team. And for the record, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been a thorn in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 side for some time \xe2\x80\x93 not just this year. When the Orioles went to the post season in 2012 for the first time since 1997, it\xe2\x80\x99s like they realized that they were being left out of the AL East party. So in no way am I suggesting that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t a good team. The question is whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re just good, or of championship caliber.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireCourtesy of Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY SportsFirst off, as I said above they re-made their team at the trade deadline last month. And who says that they\xe2\x80\x99re finished? They could still make trades through waivers in August \xe2\x80\x93 just as the Orioles can, for the record.\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m in favor of teams using the trade deadline to add a piece that could help them. The O\xe2\x80\x99s, among other teams did this with various players. However I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure the idea behind the trade deadline is to re-tool one\xe2\x80\x99s roster. Toronto fans might argue that they were good before, but now they\xe2\x80\x99re\xc2\xa0great. And they might be right, who knows.The national media also is having a field day throwing out the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re the first team in over 50 years to have two eleven-game winning streaks in the same season. Make no mistake about the fact that this is impressive. The degree of difficulty in doing something like that is totally intangible. And yes, it takes a degree of skill to do this.However if you look at their record, it\xe2\x80\x99s also as strong as it is largely\xc2\xa0because of those winning streaks.\xc2\xa0Any random good team might go 7-4 over a span of eleven games (give or take a game or so). So if you factor that into their record, they in theory would take a step backwards in a sense.Some folks might say that this same logic could be applied to a team such as the 2014 Orioles. Maybe it could for all I know. But that team, much like this year\xe2\x80\x99s incarnation, never went on an elongated winning streak. I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that winning streaks are bad, but you\xe2\x80\x99d be remiss not to admit that one of that length is a bit of a stretch for most teams. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take away from their feat by calling it an anamoly, however there might be something to that.Part of winning eleven straight games (twice) in Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s case is that they\xe2\x80\x99re an incredibly loose and free team. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t bound by the pressures of conforming to behaving a certain way, and they very much\xc2\xa0let it fly\xc2\xa0by wearing their emotions on their sleeves. Contrast this with the Orioles, who carry a bit more of a reserved approach to the game. So should the O\xe2\x80\x99s be more like Toronto?\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerMy answer to that will always be a resounding\xc2\xa0NO. If Toronto wants to behave in the manner that they do, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. At some point if they go overboard they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pay the piper in a sense. Granted you win eleven straight games by being loose, and the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t have the ability to act that way \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s just not in their makeup. But while that looseness might well lift a good team into a light where they look great, baseball\xe2\x80\x99s also a game of conformity.This is not to call out Toronto, because the fact is that they\xe2\x80\x99re a good team. However I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between being good and using a slight amount of smoke in mirrors so as to suggest that you\xe2\x80\x99re of a championship caliber. For all I know I\xe2\x80\x99m way off and they are a championship caliber team. History \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0future history, that is \xe2\x80\x93 will be the judge of that. But the fact is that sometimes steadiness is better suited for greatness than spurts of emotion.Next: Baltimore Orioles, Adam Jones keep it professional after no-noMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles totally buried Oakland starter Kendall Graveman with spade after spade of hits (four doubles and two homers) and runners circling the bases. But it was merely the beginning. The O\xe2\x80\x99s punished every pitcher to follow, as only the position player Ike Davis escaped without giving up runs.Good things happen on days when eight of your nine starters get multiple base hits. Good things happen when you pound out 26 hits in eight innings. Good things happen when you are 12-for-23 with runners in scoring position. Good things happen when you register 10 extra-base hits and your first three spots in the lineup go 12-for-17 with a walk.The best thing that happens when all the good things are added up is a final score of 18-2.Yes, it is a pretty weird game; and it is too bad it cannot count for more than one win. It is also too bad the Orioles could not bank a few runs to spend on Monday night against a very tough starter.How weird was the game? The bottom of the eighth inning featured a position player for the A\xe2\x80\x99s pitching to a relief pitcher for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and Jason Garcia walked in his first career at-bat. Garcia is going to finish the 2015 season for the Orioles with the #1 OBP of 1.000! This situation evolved as Steve Clevenger was sent from the DH position to play first base, thus causing the O\xe2\x80\x99s to lose their DH.

He has a very locked-in approach of moving the barrel of the bat to the ball. This bodes well for the future. Even if Matt Wieters is re-signed, the Orioles could use Clevenger as a third catcher and DH \xe2\x80\x94 who can play first base. After going 4-for-6, he is now batting .450 on the season in Baltimore (9-for-20).Who should the Orioles single out as the offensive star of the game? Surely it is Gerardo Parra who had five hits, including a homer in the first inning to start off the scoring. Or is it Caleb Joseph? The O\xe2\x80\x99s catcher had three hits and a walk in five plate appearances, knocking in four runs with a double and homer. But how could Adam Jones not be considered? He had a pair of homers, his 21st and 22nd of the season.Comparatively speaking, Manny Machado and Jonathan Schoop looked bad, only getting three hits each. And Chris Davis really stunk up the place, only getting two singles and one RBI, while striking out twice!Wei-Yin Chen was not at his best, but he got the Orioles through six innings against another of those boring teams that foul off pitch after pitch.Come back tomorrow for separate articles on Chen and run support numbers, and another on the hitting travails of J.J.

Giving up a first-inning run and struggling with some high pitch counts, it looked for the first two innings like the battle of the vowels might again come down to the O\xe2\x80\x99s needing to walk-off a homer against the A\xe2\x80\x99s.But then the Orioles scored 18 runs on 26 hits, as we yesterday chronicled all the things that went well in an incredible offensive explosion. It was monstrous, even by slow-pitch softball standards.Buck Showalter, Adam Jones and several other players remarked about how, at different times in a baseball career, one gets to live on both sides of games such as these.And Wei-Yin Chen has lived on both sides when it comes to the run support he has received. The win yesterday was only the seventh this season for Chen, who tallied a total of 16 last year. So he\xe2\x80\x99s not having a season that is nearly as good, right? Nope! It is actually a bit better this year than in 2014.Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at some numbers. First, here are his basic categorical stats from his four years in Baltimore \xe2\x80\xa6 (OBA = opponent batting average) \xe2\x80\xa6YearGW-LERAOBAWHIP20123212-114.02.2501.2612013237-74.07.2721.32120143116-63.54.2661.2282015237-63.20.2521.170Total10942-303.72.2601.240\xc2\xa0Clearly by these numbers, Chen is having a very good season in spite of his record. Records can lie \xe2\x80\x94 at least a little bit \xe2\x80\x94 but the earned run average, especially for starters, tends to tell the truth over time. And I would submit that the WHIP tells the most truth, and clearly it is quite decent at 1.170 this year \xe2\x80\xa6 very good for a starter.

Here are the averages of numbers of runs scored by the Orioles in Chen\xe2\x80\x99s four years in Baltimore \xe2\x80\xa62012 \xe2\x80\x94 4.62013 \xe2\x80\x94 4.12014 \xe2\x80\x94 5.72015 \xe2\x80\x94 3.6That final number for this year is actually from before the 18-run game on Sunday. Once that is factored in, the average rises immediately to 4.2 runs per game.The great baseball-reference.com web site tracks run support in three categories: 0 to 2 run per game, 3 to 5, and 6 or more. Let me chart that for you also over the four years, giving the totals in each category as well as Chen\xe2\x80\x99s ERA and won-loss record for each \xe2\x80\xa6Runs\xe2\x80\x9812\xe2\x80\x9813\xe2\x80\x9814\xe2\x80\x9815TotalERAW-L0-28587284.144-213-516121211513.4919-96+85115303.7419-0Total322331231093.7242-20\xc2\xa0Indeed, the chart above demonstrates the great run support that Chen received in 2014 on his way to a 16-7 record. And though he appears to not be having a year of 2015 that is as good, actually it could successfully be argued that it is better.

That stands to reason, as a pitcher really needs to bear down. It is discouraging to be pitching with no run support, making a pitcher fear the slightest mistake. And on the other end of the spectrum, a pitcher can feel less of a demand to be precise when playing with a lead.It would be great for the Baltimore Orioles to re-sign Wei-Yin Chen after the season, as he becomes a free agent. But these numbers are good enough to likely receive a bigger contract elsewhere. I would bet on Seattle, with the cooler climate and Asian population base.Next: The hitting troubles of J.J.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsHowever one of the big narratives in the first half of the season was that the AL East was a poor division this season. And at the time, there was really nothing that could be said or done that would dissuade anyone from thinking that. Heck, we even heard that going back to last year. I had a lot of comments on Birds Watcher and on twitter to the effect that the O\xe2\x80\x99s were the best team in a very poor division. Granted they ran away with that poor division \xe2\x80\x93 but that of course took away from people\xe2\x80\x99s points.\xc2\xa0Live Feed baltimore oriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore WireBut if you look at the standings this morning, by virtue of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 win and Anaheim\xe2\x80\x99s loss last night, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are now in the second wild card soot. So that means that if the season were to end today (which again folks, it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet remotely over), New York would win the AL East and the O\xe2\x80\x99s would have to travel to Toronto to play in the AL Wild Card game \xe2\x80\x93 yes, as the visitor.If that scenario ended up being the final result, I think a lot of fans would just assume that the season was over since Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s such a tough place for the Orioles to play. Maybe it would be over, but maybe not as well \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s the fun in an automatic elimination game. However that\xe2\x80\x99s not my point here this morning; is it not lost on people that the two wild card teams as of the moment this article is being written are AL East teams?Basically, there would be three AL East teams going to the playoffs if the season ended today. Unless of course that ends up being the final result, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to look back and mention that on August 17th this was the case. However the point is that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that a lot of people misjudged this division. When you have five teams in the division and three of them are in the push for the playoffs, if anything they might be the creme de la creme of the league \xe2\x80\x93 not the dregs.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to call the AL East the best division in the game either, but my point is that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a pushover division like the national media wanted to play up earlier in the year. We were led to believe that the Orioles were only the champions of the east last year because\xc2\xa0someone had to win it, and that this year\xe2\x80\x99s champion would be in the same boat. Again bear in mind that these teams will be playing each other a lot in September. That will truly decide who goes to the post season and who stays home.

08/18/2015,"[('Tuesday Bird Droppings: Where it only gets better than ...', "" Hello, friends. If you had asked me back on Friday morning, what are the chances that the Orioles will sweep the entirety of the four game series against the Athletics? I am sure that I would have told you 0%. Some of that is the particular brand of Mark Brown pessimism with which many of you are familiar, yes. But a lot of it is that it's hard to sweep a four game series against any team, even a bad team. As it turns out, Oakland was just the right level of bad at just the right time. Thanks for that, guys.    All of the weekend's activity (plus Monday's) leaves the Orioles a half game up on the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Orange County, California, United States of America for the second wild card spot in the American League. Whichever team prevails in that chase - Texas also lurks a game back, with the Rays and Twins still in the periphery at 2.5 games back - will currently go for one game, winner takes all, in Rogers Centre. There is a lot of baseball left to play. Don't get too excited yet. Jacob deGrom and the rest of the Mets await tonight. Around the blogO'sphere Ryan Flaherty's 0-for-34 streak approaches Orioles position-player record - Baltimore SunLast April, I wrote an article for Camden Chat about where Ryan Flaherty stacks up against\xc2\xa0the worst hitters in Orioles history. I got hate mail from someone in Flaherty's home town.

MLB Announces 2015 Postseason Schedule - Bleed Cubbie BlueI am a firm believer in not counting one's chickens before the eggs hatch (not that I've ever had any chickens or hatching eggs to count), but if you are interested in the preliminary postseason schedule - just in terms of what games would be on what day - the Cubs blog has you covered. Birthdays and anniversaries On this day in 1997, the Orioles acquired Harold Baines from the White Sox for Juan Bautista, a shortstop who never made it to the majors. I guess the O's won that trade.    There are two former Orioles with birthdays today. One is Josh Rupe, one of a number of 2011 Orioles pitchers to pitch like poop but the only one whose name rhymes with poop. The other is the late Bob Kennedy, father of another former Oriole, Terry Kennedy. The elder Kennedy was here all the way back in 1954 and 1955. If today is your birthday, happy birthday! Some of those whose time on Earth has passed who share this birthday include composer Antonio Salieri, whom F. Murray Abraham won a Best Actor Oscar for portraying in 1984's Amadeus (1750); explorer Meriweather Lewis of Lewis and Clark fame (1774); and one professor/hero, Dr. Liviu Librescu (1930). Others still with us: comedian Denis Leary (1957); actress Madeleine Stowe (1958); actor and noted Orioles fan Edward Norton (1969); electronic music maestro Aphex Twin (1971); and uh... former Baltimore Raven Bart Scott (1980). On this day in history... In 1587, Virginia Dare, the granddaughter of Colony of Roanoke governor John White, became the first English child born in the Americas. Exactly three years later, White, returning from a supply trip to England, found the colony deserted. To this day the exact fate of the Lost Colony is not known. In 1783, a huge fireball meteor was spotted over Great Britain. Dragons were born that day.    In 1868, the French astronomer Pierre Janssen discovered helium, #2 on your periodic table of the elements but #1 in your hearts. In 1920, women's suffrage was enshrined in the US Constitution with the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. In 1958, Lolita was published in the United States. Do not under any circumstances ever read this book. ** And that's the way it is in Birdland on August 18 - or at least, until something happens later. Have a safe Tuesday!

New York won 5-3. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)(Photo: The Associated Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles\' resurgent offense proved to be no match for the one of the most effective pitchers in the major leagues.Jacob deGrom took a four-hitter into the eighth inning, Curtis Granderson hit two solo homers and the New York Mets beat the Orioles 5-3 Tuesday night to snap Baltimore\'s four-game winning streak.The Orioles scored 34 runs in sweeping the Oakland Athletics, but their bats were rendered powerless by deGrom, who allowed one run and five hits over 7 2-3 innings.Chris Davis struck out three times, Adam Jones didn\'t hit the ball out of the infield and Jonathan Schoop went 0 for 3.""He\'s got a good arm. Can throw all four pitches,"" Schoop said. ""He\'s sitting at mid 90s, can reach upper 90s with his fastball, and it moves.""Granderson connected off Kevin Gausman (2-5) on the game\'s second pitch, and deGrom made the lead stand for the first-place Mets. Granderson also connected in the fifth.New York has won nine in a row against the Orioles dating back to June 2010.The shaggy-haired deGrom (12-6) struck out six and lowered his ERA to 1.98, second-best in the National League behind the Dodgers\' Zack Greinke.""I just try to go up there and put up zeros and let the rest take care of itself,"" deGrom said.Making his first appearance at Camden Yards, the 6-foot-4 deGrom extended a run of impressive starts \xe2\x80\x94 he\'s 9-2 with a 1.44 ERA in 16 outings since May 11.The only glaring flaw in his performance was a sixth-inning home run by Gerardo Parra.""He\'s one of the best in the game right now. No questions,"" manager Terry Collins said. ""I\'ve talked to too many other managers and he\'s one of the first guys they ask about.""Because a sizable portion of the crowd of 34,068 backed the Mets, deGrom received a loud ovation when he walked off the mound with a 3-1 lead in the eighth.Tyler Clippard entered with a runner on first, and Parra hit a liner to right. Granderson backed up, jumped and caught the ball at the warning track.After New York added two runs in the ninth, Jeurys Familia entered with two on and one out in the bottom half. He issued two straight bases-loaded walks before retiring Manny Machado on a grounder for his 33rd save.Daniel Murphy had two doubles and two RBIs for the Mets, the only team in the NL East with a winning record. Despite dropping three straight to the Pirates over the weekend, New York is 11-5 in August.Following a 46-minute delay, during which the tarp covered the infield in preparation of a shower that never arrived, Granderson hit his franchise-record seventh leadoff homer of the season, breaking a tie with Jose Reyes (2006).Murphy delivered a two-out RBI double in the third and Granderson hit his 22nd homer in the fifth just over the outstretched glove of a leaping Jones in center field.Gausman allowed three runs, six hits and a walk in six innings.STAT PACKMets: Granderson has 16 RBIs in his last 16 games. He has 24 HRs versus the Orioles, the most against any team.Orioles: Baltimore is 9-22 against the Mets, 6-12 at home. ... Schoop committed two errors for the second time in his career.TRAINER\'S ROOMMets: RHP Bobby Parnell was placed on the 15-day disabled list with right shoulder tendinitis.

Parnell was obviously still feeling the effects of Tommy John surgery. He might not feel pain, Collins told him, but it was natural for him to need time to regain his touch.And the Mets are not in a position to wait. They are trying to hold off the Washington Nationals, win the National League East and earn their first playoff berth since 2006.The Mets placed Parnell, a respected veteran reliever, on the disabled list Tuesday with what they called right shoulder tendinitis and, having been swept over the weekend by the Pittsburgh Pirates, held a team meeting to refocus themselves and prepare for the season\xe2\x80\x99s final six weeks.Then the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 best two relievers almost blew a four-run ninth-inning lead. Jeurys Familia, the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 first-time closer, pitching in his first pennant race, walked in two runners with the bases loaded before retiring Manny Machado to finish off a 5-3 win over the Baltimore Orioles.

Credit             Elsa/Getty Images           DeGrom dominated the Orioles the same way he had most every team he had faced this year, locating his pitches with precision. He had the Orioles so flummoxed that Adam Jones, their No. 3 hitter and a perennial All-Star, tried to bunt for a base hit.DeGrom was only at 100 pitches, too, when Collins came to retrieve him in the eighth, with two outs and a runner on first.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  DeGrom had lowered his E.R.A. to 1.98, the second-lowest qualifying mark in the majors, behind only Zack Greinke\xe2\x80\x99s 1.58. But Gerardo Parra was coming to bat, and he had hit a solo home run off deGrom in his previous at-bat. The many Mets fans in attendance here gave deGrom a standing ovation as he left the mound.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cI felt like I could keep going,\xe2\x80\x9d deGrom said later.Instead, Tyler Clippard came on, and Parra hit a fly ball to the warning track, which required Curtis Granderson to make a leaping catch to preserve a 3-1 lead. By the time Clippard took the mound for the bottom of the ninth, the Mets had extended their lead to 5-1.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Mets looked well in control at that point. In the third inning, Daniel Murphy had doubled, driving in Wilmer Flores from first base in part because Orioles second baseman Jonathan Schoop had dropped the relay throw. Michael Conforto had gunned out a runner at home plate in the fifth. Curtis Granderson had hit two solo home runs, and the Mets had tacked on two runs in the ninth thanks to an error by Schoop.

Familia came on and allowed an infield single, with Lucas Duda missing first base with his foot while fielding the throw. Familia then walked two batters before finally righting himself.

He had been charged with two losses in the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 last three games, his E.R.A. had ballooned to 5.59, and Mets fans had viciously booed him. With Parnell on the disabled list, Collins said, he can work with the pitching coach Dan Warthen and tweak his mechanics away from the spotlight of a playoff race, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout having to jeopardize anything.\xe2\x80\x9dReinforcing the bullpen will be one of the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 most important challenges down the stretch. The back end is usually sturdy, with Clippard and Familia handling the eighth and ninth innings. But Collins acknowledged that he would have to mix and match in the seventh, depending on the matchups or whether a young reliever asserted himself.One candidate may be Logan Verrett, the player the Mets promoted to replace Parnell on the roster. In 17 bullpen appearances this year, between the majors and the minors, Verrett, a third-round draft pick in 2011, has posted a 2.36 E.R.A. But the Mets have jostled him between starting and relieving so much that his role remains unclear.Verrett, 25, may ultimately be a spot starter. Collins indicated that Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard could skip starts in September in order to comply with their inning limits. Given how the Mets handled deGrom on Tuesday, it looks as though they will proceed with caution.

08/20/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Long Road of Henry Urrutia', 'Aug 19, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles left fielder Henry Urrutia (51) hits a walk off home run during the ninth inning against the New York Mets at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Baltimore Orioles defeated New York Mets 5-4. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsIt is difficult to contemplate a more fantastic story than that of Henry Urrutia and the joy of his walk-off home run for the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday evening over the New York Mets, 5-4.\xc2\xa0 It was the first home run of his career for the 28-year-old Cuban defector.Things have come slowly in life for Urrutia. It has been a long and circuitous road that has now landed him in OPACY with the chance to hit a long ball and circle the bases.Even defecting did not work out for him the first time that he attempted it in 2010. He successfully did just less than four years ago, going to Haiti. But immigration issues piled up and it was 2013 before he could begin his baseball career again.He began at AA Bowie where he batted .365 in 52 games with seven home runs. He was moved up to AAA where, after a short adjustment, he batted .316 in 29 games with a pair of homers.

In 24 games he batted .276, showing an ability to hit the opposite way with many singles through the left side of the infield.Next came the Arizona Fall League. Urrutia hit .377 and was third overall in league batting.Unfortunately, 2014 happened. Urrutia hit .262 in spring training but did not inspire sufficiently to make the Baltimore Orioles roster heading north. The disappointment was obvious and hit him hard.He got off to a bad start at Norfolk. He was batting a paltry .220 at the end of April. And then a sports hernia injury took him out for all of May and June. He came back to play for the Gulf Coast Orioles team and only hit .230 there.Finally in August, Urrutia was moved back to the Tides. There he did hit .310 for the final month of the season, salvaging something of worth from his 2014 efforts.Urrutia again had a good spring training in 2015, but the Orioles had plans for quite a number of outfielders ahead of him \xe2\x80\xa6 guys with the last names of Lough, De Aza, Snider, Young \xe2\x80\xa6 guys who are now all gone. But Urrutia remains.Could this be the beginning of a long-term outfield assignment for him with the O\xe2\x80\x99s? Clearly his defense has improved. He still hits the ball to left field a lot (including his first home run), but I have never understood why this has been criticized by many. I remember a fellow named Rod Carew who did this all the time. His picture is on a wall in Cooperstown, NY.The post-game interviews of Urrutia were among the most awkward I have ever seen. Clearly this really fine young man is sensitive about his developing English skills. But like everything else in his life, it may be a bit delayed in arriving, but he will work on it and a day will come when it gets to where it needs to be.The win was a good one for the Orioles, who needed it badly to keep pace with the Yankees. The O\xe2\x80\x99s simply need to keep winning, and the opportunity to do so is before them as they will finish this week with four straight against the Twins.As we wrote yesterday, the O\xe2\x80\x99s needed to forget the loss to the Mets, especially Jonathan Schoop. And he certainly did so by hitting a two-run homer and making some great defensive plays.Next: A game to quickly forget ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Surging Orioles Begin 4-Game Series With Fading Twins ...', ' (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 This has already been quite a homestand for the Baltimore Orioles. Four games against the fading Minnesota Twins could make it even better. Fresh off yet another walkoff victory, the Orioles seek their sixth win in seven games in the series opener Thursday night. Baltimore was eager to return home after losing five of nine on the West Coast and promptly continued its success at Camden Yards with a four-game sweep of Oakland. Two of those wins came on game-ending homers and Henry Urrutia delivered a third in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 5-4 victory over the New York Mets. It was the first career home run for Urrutia, recalled from Triple-A Norfolk on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the best moment of my career,\xe2\x80\x9d Urrutia said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I make good contact I was running for the base and in my mind I said, `I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe this.\'\xe2\x80\x9d Jonathan Schoop added a two-run shot and Adam Jones also went deep for the Orioles (62-57), winners of 10 of 13 at home since the All-Star break. They have homered at least once in all of those games, hitting 27 total. Jones and Chris Davis have been at the forefront of the offensive surge. Jones has batted .333 with six homers and 11 RBIs in his last 11 games, while Davis is hitting .342 with six home runs and 10 RBIs in 10 contests. Also making a contribution is newcomer Gerardo Parra, who has a .444 average with three homers and eight runs during a six-game hitting streak. Miguel Gonzalez (9-8, 4.42 ERA) seeks his first victory in five starts for Baltimore. Since winning at Tampa on July 25, the right-hander has gone 0-2 with a 6.64 ERA in four starts. The best outing of that span, however, came Saturday when he allowed three runs over seven innings against Oakland before leaving without a decision in a 4-3 victory. Gonzalez went 1-1 with a 3.09 ERA in two starts against the Twins last season. Minnesota was 10 games over .500 on July 17 but has since gone 9-21 to fall behind Baltimore, Texas and Tampa Bay in the battle for the second wild card. The start of a 10-game trip hasn\xe2\x80\x99t provided any answers for the Twins (59-61), who were swept in three by the New York Yankees to drop two games under .500 for the first time since April 30. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to move forward,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Paul Molitor told MLB\xe2\x80\x99s official website after Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-3 loss. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tough way to open a long road trip. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no room for self-pity. We have to dig a little deeper and then get ready for Baltimore.\xe2\x80\x9d Molitor\xe2\x80\x99s lineup will look a little different with center fielder Aaron Hicks out for an undetermined period after he strained his left hamstring running out a grounder Wednesday. The Twins will call up top prospect Byron Buxton from Triple-A Rochester to take Hicks\xe2\x80\x99 place. Buxton batted .189 in 11 games with Minnesota in June. Also missing for the Twins on Thursday will be All-Star closer Glen Perkins, who was given a cortisone shot for his ailing neck. The team is optimistic Perkins will be able to avoid the disabled list. This will be the third start for Tyler Duffey (1-1, 6.75), who rebounded from a rough major league debut with an excellent performance. Ten days after allowing six runs in two innings at Toronto, the right-hander took a no-hitter into the sixth against Cleveland on Saturday. He yielded only a one-out double in that inning, his final one in a 4-1 victory. The Twins swept a three-game home series from the Orioles July 6-8.  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com')]"

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles suffered a blowout loss to the Minnesota Twins on Thursday night 15-2 after a long 2:31 rain delay. It would have better to have been postponed. Yes, that is a new record for runs given up this season.The picture attached to this article says it all.This game was so bad, so early, that I was starting to look forward to seeing Ryan Flaherty get a chance to play. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that has ever happened before. He did, and he broke his 0-for-34 streak!The start of Miguel Gonzalez reminded me a lot of my adolescence \xe2\x80\x94 the vast majority of what was done was very good, but when a mistake was committed, a terrible price was paid for it. Most pitches had good movement, but every pitch that was flat and in a hittable placement was spanked with great authority and disastrous results.Gonzalez has had his season unravel more and more with each passing month. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at his career, month by month, over the past four years \xe2\x80\xa62012201320142015April\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x934.605.193.42May2.704.013.343.52June2.252.886.145.75July4.914.231.825.00August1.915.252.966.14September3.092.301.69\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93Total3.253.783.234.73\xc2\xa0The stats don\xe2\x80\x99t really support the reputation that Gonzalez has had for consistency. In the bigger picture of the end-of-year numbers from 2012-14, it is true. And from July of 2014 through the first two months of this season, it is true. But overall it is up and down, and right now it is especially down at 6.14 for August.The Orioles were shut down by the power pitching of the Twins\xe2\x80\x99 veteran Tyler Duffey. You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of him over the years, right? That\xe2\x80\x99s Duffey \xe2\x80\x94 with an \xe2\x80\x9cE\xe2\x80\x9d in the name \xe2\x80\xa6 not to be confused with Hugh Duffy, the Hall of Famer from the late 1800s.

Though he had a 2.53 ERA in AA-AAA this year, his first two Big League starts had not gone well. But Duffey shut out the Orioles over the first seven innings, especially fooling them over and over with a sharp breaking ball.Though Duffey was very, very good, the Orioles were typically helpful in holding down the pitch count by swinging early and often in many at-bats. Of course, when a pitcher pounds the strike zone, good things generally happen if he has good stuff working on that evening. Duffey did.Just as the 18-2 drubbing that the O\xe2\x80\x99s laid on the A\xe2\x80\x99s a few games ago only gets to count as one win, this massacre only gets to count as one loss.As Adam Jones said after the game, \xe2\x80\x9cWe gotta just keep grinding.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Actually, I did not hear him say that, but I know for a fact that he did.

Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles have gone 10-8 in the month of August. That record is buoyed by a 5-2 homestand so far in the middle of the month.But, there is another number that is just shocking. In the 10 wins, Caleb Joseph has caught nine of those wins, with Steve Clevenger catching the other one.Matt Wieters has caught in seven of the eight losses, the only game that the Orioles lost that Wieters did not catch was the Iwakuma no-hitter.What does this mean? You tell me.People, myself included, have felt like the Orioles are a better pitching team with Caleb Joseph behind the plate since he was first called up last year. Obviously, a lot of the time has been with Matt Wieters hurt. And, for whatever reason, the Orioles have a very, very good number when Joseph gets an RBI.I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying Matt Wieters is a bad player, far from it. But, I think the Orioles are spoiled by the abilities they have at catcher. In 2014, when the Orioles had their best record in years, who caught the majority of the season? Caleb Joseph.

However, can a player who has suffered several injuries recently be an everyday catcher still? A look at the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 opponent this weekend may be a glimpse into that.Wieters was supposed to be \xe2\x80\x98Mauer with Power.\xe2\x80\x99 Yet, as Joe Mauer has aged, what power he had has decreased. And, he also can no longer catch, playing either first base or designated hitter.Matt will turn 30 next year in May. He is probably going to get paid over $10 million for the next four to five years this offseason. For a team in a situation like the Birds are in, it would be wise for them to not offer Wieters a contract.Caleb Joseph has shown he is more than capable as a hitter and a catcher. This year has revealed that when Caleb has a good amount of rest, like 2 or 3 days a week, he can be a very good catcher.Steve Clevenger has really worked on his catching as well, and his bat has never been an issue.Matt Wieters was supposed to be a once-every-decade player. He has been an All-Star, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a star for the Baltimore Orioles.It is clear that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 staff enjoys pitching to Caleb, as evidenced by the ERAs to each pitcher.

And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing; I\xe2\x80\x99m not necessarily blaming the Orioles in a sense. Look at last night\xe2\x80\x99s game, or heck even look at last year\xe2\x80\x99s ALCS against Kansas City.

But that was the story of last year\xe2\x80\x99s ALCS, and similar freak things have been the story of various losses this year. And not all of them are\xc2\xa0freak accidents per se. In general the conventional way of thinking tells us that solo home runs aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to beat you in the long run. But when you lose a game 3-1 which includes the opponent hitting two solo homers, they do turn into a problem.Similarly, bloops and dying quails into the outfield aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to beat you. But combine that with a lead off walk, and it might turn into a problem. The Orioles are very good \xe2\x80\x93 and I mean\xc2\xa0incredibly good\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 when it comes to the positioning of fielders. The infield shifts are one thing, but Showalter pays such close attention to detail that guys move a few steps here and there on every hitter, and sometimes every pitch.This of course is due to the fact that statistics are showing that this guy hits the ball to this area for the most part, and even that perhaps if he makes contact with two strikes it seems to always fly to this part of the field. But that leaves the Orioles suseptible to the unexpected. What do you do when a guy loops a broken bat single into the outfield, or a swinging bunt down the third base line when the infield is back? That kind of throws the numbers into file 13, if you know what I mean.All we can say is that in any sport (as in any facet of life perhaps) we should expect the unexpected. And by that I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the O\xe2\x80\x99s shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t defend to the statistics and so forth. They absolutely should. However what can be done is to limit what can be limited. If not for the lead off walk in the eighth inning last night, Minnesota might score only one run \xe2\x80\x93 maybe none at all.Furthermore, perhaps if in the backs of the minds of the players (and coaches) they\xe2\x80\x99re thinking that something strange could possibly happen, they might be a bit more prepared for it. Believe me folks, I\xe2\x80\x99m a pretty conventional guy myself. I thus always say that if you want to \xe2\x80\x9cdefeat me\xe2\x80\x9d all you have to do is do something totally unexpected. (If you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the term\xc2\xa0think outside the box\xe2\x80\xa6well, I am \xe2\x80\x9cthe box.\xe2\x80\x9d) Perhaps if he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking that a swinging bunt could possibly be coming down the line, Machado might be a step quicker in fielding it.\xc2\xa0More from Editorials/Analysis2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season2/18 - Baltimore Orioles: How safe is Joey Rickard\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster?2/15 - Baltimore Orioles: Time to snap up Jorge De La Rosa?2/13 - Baltimore Orioles: Nevada Sportsbooks Betting on a 2017 Decline1/30 - Baltimore Orioles: Craig Breslow is an intriguing name for the Orioles to considerThat all might be a bit of a stretch, because players are pretty nimble on their feet as it is.

Hardy, Minnesota took the lead for the first time in the seventh.Tillman issued a one-out walk to Eddie Rosario, who advanced to third on a hit-and-run single by Torii Hunter. Kurt Suzuki followed with a squeeze bunt down the first-base line that left Tillman no choice but to throw to first as Rosario crossed the plate.Brad Brach entered and walked Eduardo Escobar intentionally before Buxton lined a single to left. Buxton, the second overall pick in the 2012 draft, came in hitting .208 (10 for 48) over 13 games in his first major league season.In this game, the rookie laid down a sacrifice bunt in the sixth to help the Twins draw even, then delivered the decisive hit in the seventh.""It was nice to see him get his first RBI in a big situation,"" said Minnesota manager Paul Molitor, who turned 59 on Saturday.After spending much of the season with Class AAA Rochester, Buxton was delighted to contribute to the big league club.""When all the hard work you put in in the cage results in a base hit to win the game, that\'s all you can ask for,"" he said.

The Minnesota Twins have taken advantage, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll look to take the first three of this crucial four-game set Saturday night at Camden Yards. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s relievers entered this series with a 2.68 ERA that ranked second in the AL and fourth in baseball, but it surrendered a season-worst eight runs in four innings of Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s 15-2 loss to the Twins. Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer and Wei-Yin Chen pitched six solid innings Friday before All-Star reliever Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day allowed three runs and four hits in two-thirds of an inning in the eighth as Minnesota rallied for a 4-3 victory. O\xe2\x80\x99Day hadn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed a run in his previous 11 appearances, and the Orioles (62-59) had won 51 of their previous 52 when leading after seven. Texas beat Detroit to pull even with Baltimore behind the Los Angeles Angels for the AL\xe2\x80\x99s second wild card. \xe2\x80\x9cThe baseball gods aren\xe2\x80\x99t always kind to you,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wear it and try to come back and know tomorrow you have a chance to have a different feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Tillman (9-7, 4.54 ERA) hopes to keep the bullpen\xe2\x80\x99s work to a minimum in this contest. Tillman has come on strong since June 28, going 4-0 with a 2.13 ERA while giving up two runs or fewer seven times in eight starts. He bounced back from a rough outing against Seattle on Aug. 11 \xe2\x80\x93 his first start after skipping his turn in the rotation because of a sore left ankle \xe2\x80\x93 and allowed a pair of solo homers through seven innings of Monday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-2 win over Oakland. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like right now as long as our starters are giving the team a chance to win and get deep into the game, set up the bullpen how it needs to be set up, I think we will be ready,\xe2\x80\x9d Tillman said after his last outing. The right-hander, though, is 0-3 with a 5.06 ERA in five career starts against the Twins and has lasted a combined 9 1-3 innings over the last three. He\xe2\x80\x99ll try to prevent Minnesota from winning three straight for the first time since a four-game run July 10-17. Kurt Suzuki\xe2\x80\x99s two-run single put the Twins ahead for good Friday, and he\xe2\x80\x99s driven in seven while batting .429 during a five-game hitting streak. He\xe2\x80\x99s 8 for 17 in four games against the Orioles, who have dropped all five meetings this season. The Twins (61-61) are 1 1/2 games behind the Orioles and Rangers in the wild-card race. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a big victory because we\xe2\x80\x99re playing a team that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good and they\xe2\x80\x99re ahead of us right now, and we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get in that wild card,\xe2\x80\x9d outfielder Torii Hunter said. The Twins look to keep rolling behind Kyle Gibson (8-9, 3.99), who has continued to struggle since the All-Star break. Gibson had a 2.85 ERA while allowing at least five earned runs twice through his first 18 starts, including an 8-3 win over Baltimore on July 7 when he struck out seven in six innings. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone 0-3 with a 7.91 ERA in his last six, though. The right-hander allowed at least six runs for the fourth time in that stretch in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 8-7, 10-inning loss to the New York Yankees.

To be honest, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the Orioles can change their offensive scheme. They have been a home run hitting team since 2012, no changes there. They keep saying they want to improve their on-base percentage, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened.The pitching is what it is at this point. The bullpen is showing signs of wear and tear after a season where they have had to pitch so often. That is despite Jason Garcia pitching very well recently, and Brian Matusz as well.This looks a lot like 2013. The Orioles are going to hang around, and continue to put themselves in the Wild Card conversation, but in the end, this team may not have it.It looked like after the Mariners no-hitter, the season might be slowly coming to a close. Then the Orioles swept the Athletics in a four-game series, and all of a sudden were right back in the Wild Card hunt.Now, they have lost three in a row. And with a series with the AL-leading Royals on tap to start next week, the team is going to need to regroup.

However Gausman found himself down early \xe2\x80\x93 thanks again in part to a ball that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hit hard. Joe Mauer lined a very soft blooper into left field with two outs. He was followed by Miguel Sano, who smacked a two-run homer. That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much how this series has gone from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint; it seems that the moniker for Minnesota has been\xc2\xa0the softer the hit the more damage it does.\xc2\xa0Live Feed buck showaterBut Gausman settled down, and did more than his share to keep the Orioles in a spot to win the game. The Birds finally broke through in the last of the third with an RBI-single by Jonathan Schoop, which cut the lead to 2-1. After that initial flurry in the first, Minnesota appeared in no position to threaten; that\xe2\x80\x99s due in large part to Gausman. Schoop came through again two innings later with a two-RBI single in the fifth, which gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 3-2 lead.And that lead stood up for most of the afternoon. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day redeemed himself after Friday night by retiring Minnesota 1-2-3, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s even tried to get something going in the last of the eighth by pinch-hitting Matt Wieters for Ryan Flaherty. Wieters recorded an out to end the inning, and was replaced in the order by J.J. Hardy (who also took Ryan Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s spot in the field at shortstop). Keep in mind, Flaherty was in the game because Hardy was resting a sore groin.These things start innocently enough \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s always the case. Brian Dozier led off the inning with a grounder to Machado at third. Machado\xe2\x80\x99s throw to first was a bit off, and Chris Davis dropped the pick. It was charged an error on Machado, however it\xe2\x80\x99s also a play Davis should have made.

(Sano and manager Paul Molitor were also ejected for arguing the third strike).\xc2\xa0Trevor Plouffe then sent a seeing-eye single through the left side of the infield, which allowed Dozier to score.

If you\xe2\x80\x99re the O\xe2\x80\x99s, that has to be incredibly frustrating.

And sure enough\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in every game the teams have played this year. However this time that mistake came from a rare source: Buck Showalter. It\xe2\x80\x99s unfair in a way to second guess after a loss where his decision(s) didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out. He is the reining AL Manager of the Year, after all. He\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten more baseball than I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever know. But work with me here, and maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll see my point.Courtesy of Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsBefore Adam Jones struck out to end the inning, the Birds had two runners on with two gone in the last of the 11th. Showalter sent Jimmy Paredes out to pinch run for J.J. Hardy, who is now headed to the DL with a groin injury. In the top of the 12th, the Birds shifted Manny Machado over to his old position at shortstop, and inserted Paredes at third. Machado was thought to be a prized shortstop, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played the position since 2012 in the minors. As for Paredes, well\xe2\x80\xa6he has a decent bat.With one down Machado committed a fielding error at short on a ball that took a bad hop and allowed Eduardo Escobar to get to second base. With two down Paredes committed an error of his own, which allowed Escobar to score. And that was your ballgame \xe2\x80\x93 Minnesota defeating the Orioles 4-3. While Machado was originally a shortstop, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played there in some time; and Paredes isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good fielder overall.So the point here is that the Orioles re-shuffled their infield due to offensive changes, and it backfired. When guys are playing at spots where they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be, mistakes like that will happen. Any game is a team effort, however it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible that Buck Showalter over-managed or even out-thought himself in this game. And that might have even started by pinch-hitting Matt Wieters, which forced Hardy into the lineup.It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to put too much blame on Showalter in that sense, given the fact that his moves in games have worked out much more often than not. And having said that fans also need to realize that Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s human just like the rest of us. Mistakes happen \xe2\x80\x93 and hindsight is always 20/20.

The team made a plethora of moves today gearing up for the road trip to Kauffman Stadium.The Orioles have recalled RHP Jorge Rondon from Triple-A Norfolk and have reinstated INF/OF Steve Pearce from the 15-day disabled list.\xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) August 24, 2015Additionally, the Orioles have placed INF J.J.

Pearce is not putting up the numbers similar to last season, but the utility player was heating up before heading to the disabled list. He batted .293 in June and .292 in July, but has had just five plate appearances since the All-Star break.J.J. Hardy has really been struggling and the Orioles had to be concerned about his play. He is batting .157 in August and has become a liability in the Orioles lineup. It\xe2\x80\x99s sad to say this, but Hardy is no longer an every day player. He has become a defensive specialist at this point of his career because of his offensive woes. The move to the DL is probably merited, but the Orioles couldn\xe2\x80\x99t risk to have him on the roster right now until he gets better at the plate.Nolan Reimold\xe2\x80\x98s departure comes as no surprise as Pearce makes his return. Reimold has not impressed since being called up in June and is batting .185 in the month of August. The play of Henry Urrutia, and the ability of Chris Davis and Pearce to play the outfield as well made Reimold expendable.

Mandatory Credit: Denny Medley-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles continue to dig the hole deeper and deeper in terms of hopes for a return to the playoffs even as a wildcard team. A 3-2 loss to the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday evening was their sixth consecutive defeat, dropping their season record under .500 at 62-63.Over this six-game losing streak, the Orioles have scored only 15 runs, while allowing 39. However, they have been twice beaten when the opponent has scored only three runs, and twice with four runs. But it has been proven to be 100% impossible to win when the other team scores more runs than you do!

Now at 77-48, they are a well-structured club and seem to be the prototype for the modern game of baseball. The sport is continuously morphing, but KC seems to have it figured out right now, and all teams would do well to learn from it. The Orioles only have a couple of the pieces of the puzzle.Looking statistically at the Royals and where they stand in the American League in varied categories, they dominate in few ways. But the total package when put together makes them the cream of the crop this year.They are dead last in the league in home runs with 99 (whereas the O\xe2\x80\x99s have 162). Some of that is the ballpark in which they play. However, they are fifth in doubles (223) and second with triples (34).\xc2\xa0 The Orioles rank 14th and 9th respectively. And the Royals hit 15 points higher than the O\xe2\x80\x99s in total average. Put this all together and the Orioles are only three-thousands higher in total OPS \xe2\x80\x93 fifth in the AL, versus sixth for KC.But KC is the better-fit team to win close games by their style of offense. And this is the need in the modern game of baseball with lower scoring and strong bullpens. The Orioles are now 17-23 in one-run games, whereas the Royals are 21-11, and 8-2 in extra-inning contests.Here is a huge statistical difference between the two clubs: The Orioles have struck out a total of 1016 times, as compared to only 711 for the Royals \xe2\x80\x94 the best in the league by far. Yet at the same time, KC has the fewest number of bases on balls in the A.L.\xc2\xa0 So they work counts and put balls into play with a decent on base percentage.And the Royals have speed. They are second in stolen bases with 83, whereas the O\xe2\x80\x99s are last with only 34. This speed especially helps them in the outfield. And Kansas City is very athletic, being more than guys who can simply hit and throw from a standing position.In 2014, the Royals demonstrated the model of having a shut-down bullpen as a prescription for success. And they are the best in 2015. In this regard, the Orioles have a similar strength, along with similar strengths as defensive teams. \xc2\xa0Starting pitching is everything? The Royals\xe2\x80\x99 starters have the fewest innings pitched in the A.L.Actually, the starting pitching is only marginally better for the Royals \xe2\x80\x93 who are 11th in the American League in ERA for starters, whereas the Orioles are 13th.\xc2\xa0 And the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 starters have thrown the least number of innings by starting pitchers in the entire A.L.\xc2\xa0 So much for the theory that starting pitching is everything.But again, the bullpen of the Royals is the best with a 2.34 ERA and 44 saves. The Orioles rank third at 2.86. Only Tampa Bay has more bullpen innings pitched than KC (by two innings)\xe2\x80\xa6 so again, the theory of an overused bullpen does not hold true for the best record in the league.All in all, the stats show the Royals to be a better than average team for sure, but not a dominant team, other than the bullpen and team speed. But putting it all together, the combined talents comprise a team that can fight and win close games.

(AP) \xe2\x80\x94 There is no one thing that Orioles manager Buck Showalter can point to when it comes to understanding why his once-soaring club has suddenly lost six straight games.Sometimes, the offense goes flat. Once in a while, the pitching and defense are to blame.""Always takes a little bit of everything,"" he said after a 3-2 loss to the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday night. Everybody wants to throw one big circle around one thing. It\'s a lot of things. A lot of things. And you can\'t (borrow) from Peter to pay Paul in this game.""While pitching and defense were to blame in an 8-3 series-opening loss, it was a letdown by the offense that ruined the Orioles\' chances Tuesday night. Manny Machado was 0 for 5 with three strikeouts, the team managed seven hits total, and eight runners were stranded on base.The Orioles (62-63) are now below .500 for the first time since they were 48-49 on July 26.""We\'ve got to create more opportunities,"" Baltimore catcher Caleb Joseph said. ""It\'s tough when you get runners on base one or two times an inning, every game. They\'re creating sawdust in the batter\'s box trying to get the guy in. It\'s not for lack of effort. Everybody in the clubhouse is working their tails off trying to make a push here.""Kendrys Morales hit a solo homer, and Mike Moustakas and Eric Hosmer also drove in runs for the Royals, who are trending the other direction with their fourth straight win.Danny Duffy (7-6) dodged trouble for most of 5 2-3 innings, allowing two runs on five hits and two walks. The left-hander struck out five in a start that began in crisp efficiency and ended with the Orioles threatening to pull ahead in the sixth inning.Luke Hochevar calmed things down with an inning of relief, though. Kelvin Herrera had no trouble with the rest of the seventh and eighth, and Wade Davis pitched a perfect ninth in place of closer Greg Holland to earn his 12th save.Miguel Gonzalez (9-10) allowed all three runs on six hits and three walks in 4 1-3 innings, the latest in a string of lousy starts for Baltimore. Gonzalez is 0-4 in his last six tries.""It\'s been rough ever since I came back from the disabled list,"" said Gonzalez, who missed time with a groin injury. ""But sometimes the game\'s not fair, and it\'s a game of failure.""You\'ve just got to stay focused and not think too much when you\'re out there,"" he said. ""I think that\'s been the main point for me this year, the second half.""The Royals never trailed after Morales sent a 3-2 pitch into the fountains in right field in the second inning. Hosmer added an RBI groundout in the third, and Moustakas delivered yet another two-out single by the league\'s best-hitting team in such situations to score another run.The Orioles got two runs back in the fourth when Matt Wieters drew a two-out walk and Steve Pearce, Jonathan Schoop and Caleb Joseph strung together a trio of singles. But Duffy managed to get recently called up Paul Janish to ground out to end the threat.Duffy was in trouble again in the sixth, but Hochevar got Joseph to fly out to deep right field to leave runners on second and third and preserve the 3-2 lead.It was up to one of the best bullpens in the majors to take care of the rest.""They did an awesome job,"" Royals manager Ned Yost said. ""It\'s what they do.""EVEN NEDYost managed his 900th game with the Royals. He is now 450-450. ""I guess it\'s cool,"" he said, pointing out that at one point he was 53 games under .500. ""The last two years we\'ve won a bunch of baseball games with a really good group of guys.""TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: C Steve Clevenger went on the three-day paternity list to attend the birth of his daughter.

But for good measure Moustakas would add an RBI-single in the last of the seventh and the O\xe2\x80\x99s trailed 5-1.However the Birds would make a comeback attempt with two outs in the ninth. Caleb Joseph\xc2\xa0would smack an RBI-double, followed by another RBI-double by Manny Machado. But in the end it was too little too late, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s fell once again in Kansas City by the score of 5-3.A more pressing concern in the immediate interim for the Orioles is the condition of center fielder\xc2\xa0Adam Jones, who slammed into the wall on a ground rule double in the first inning. Jones appeared dazed, but stayed in the game. However he was lifted for a pinch hitter in the third inning (his next at-bat).

Texas won 4-1. Mandatory Credit: Tim Heitman-USA TODAY SportsAnother day, another loss for the Baltimore Orioles. This time it was 4-1 to the Texas Rangers. But the common theme of the last 11 games (2-9) was evident again: poor run support and high strikeout numbers. The Orioles managed only three hits while striking out 12 times.It is no secret that the Baltimore Orioles are a free-swinging team. It has been talked about a great deal. Buck Showalter has largely avoided addressing this issue with the team, often speaking to the media that he would not put much emphasis upon more plate discipline in fears that such would take away from an aggressive approach.I understand this in raw form, but like anything there is a time where too much of something becomes a net negative. And that is the situation now with the Orioles.In my view, Rick Dempsey is a very good baseball analyst; and I frankly think he would make a great manager. On the MASN pre-game show, he spoke to this issue and of the way that opposing scouts have seen this wild swinging at balls outside the strike zone. And this is especially true on breaking pitches. So that is what the Orioles are seeing. They are not getting good pitches to hit because pitchers know they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to bring the ball to the O\xe2\x80\x99s hitters.

The Orioles rank dead last of all 30 MLB teams in terms of the number of walks per strikeout. The rate is .293. Toronto is the best at .485, the Red Sox fourth at .436, and the Yankees fifth at .434.The Orioles are #2 in total strikeouts in the American League.\xc2\xa0 They trail the Mariners by only nine and at this current rate will soon be in the lead.Some more advanced statistical metrics continue to paint this same picture.

Jonathan Schoop struck out three times against Hamels and also for the final out to Shawn Tolleson, who earned his 27th save.""I tip my cap to him,"" Schoop said of Hamels, the three-time All-Star who was acquired from Philadelphia just before the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline.

And that is more than a buck short.On the bright side, it was great to see Dariel Alvarez get his first two hits tonight. He looks so young; and he also looks totally thrilled to be in the big leagues.I will say that I am already looking forward to turning a page and seeing some of these sorts of players moving up and for a new team and new identity to arrive.

09/02/2015,"[('Orioles minor league rundown 9/1: The Wright stuff shows ...', ' Norfolk Tides 6, Charlotte (White Sox) 3 It has to be tough for a Triple-A player on the day of September call-ups if you\'re one of the ones who was left behind. You know that, essentially, no way, no how, are your big league dreams happening that season. Maybe it\'s a little easier if you\'re playing for a team that\'s competing for a playoff spot in the league. Not as good as the big leagues, but better than cashing a check in last place.    The Tides who didn\'t make the big leagues played a nice game, particularly rehabbing big leaguer Mike Wright, who held the Knights to two hits over six innings of work. Maybe the Knights hitters were the unmotivated ones. At any rate, Wright only threw 65 pitches in getting through six innings, and the fact that he was pulled when he was may mean his rehab will end and he\'ll start in Miguel Gonzalez\'s place on Saturday against the Blue Jays. If that\'s the case, well, good luck to him. Shout out to Junior Lake, who doubled in his lone at-bat but also walked three times. A player is allowed to walk three times in one game? That\'s crazy. I hope someone tells the Orioles. Altoona (Pirates) 5, Bowie Baysox 2 Starting pitcher David Hess, a fifth round pick from last year, got his first taste of Double-A, and well, it didn\'t go so great. Hess was tattooed by the Curve for four runs on six hits and two walks in only 3.1 innings of work. That was all the margin that they would need, with their pitchers giving up only two runs combined. The Baysox had eight hits scattered through the lineup but only went 1-5 with RISP; Altoona\'s batters were 4-10 in those situations.    Bowie still has a magic number of three to clinch their division of the Eastern League. They\'ve already secured a playoff spot regardless.    Carolina (Braves) 8, Frederick Keys 5 The Keys managed to keep this game relatively close despite a struggle by their starter, and also despite an astoundingly bad 1-11 with RISP in the game. How do you do that? Don\'t watch the big league club too closely these days, fellas. That\'s no way to run a railroad. Delmarva Shorebirds 6, Hickory (Rangers) 3 I basically look for two names in Shorebirds box scores: Jomar Reyes is at the top of the list, and Ademar Rifaela is also on the list. Neither of these gentlemen participated in this contest. Reyes has not played since Friday, when he took a bad hop of a ground ball off of the face. Here\'s hoping he\'s OK soon.    But Delmarva won anyway, and good for them. One interesting name who does remain, playing in only his fourth game since returning from a foot injury, is catcher Jonah Heim, 2013\'s fourth rounder, who went 1-3 and drew a walk in the game. Aberdeen IronBirds 8, Vermont (Athletics) 4 The IronBirds got all eight of their runs in the sixth inning or later, capitalizing on four errors by the Lake Monsters that led to a pair of earned runs and loading up some more offense in a more conventional way otherwise. 2015\'s third round pick, Garrett Cleavinger, pitched a couple of key innings to hold Vermont scoreless while the Aberdeen hitters rallied. Cleavinger, who as a college reliever figured to be the fastest potential big leaguer from the draft class, has struck out 28 batters in 23.1 innings over 17 games in his pro career. I\'m not sure why he didn\'t get bumped up before season\'s end, honestly.    Wednesday\'s Schedule Norfolk: vs. Gwinnett, 5:05 (doubleheader). Starters: Elih Villanueva, Eddie Gamboa Bowie: vs. Altoona, 7:05. Starter: Joe ""The Gunk"" Gunkel Frederick: vs. Carolina, 7:00. (Wine pairing?

Note that there will be no further updates on this page from either the GCL or DSL Orioles, because those seasons are over. I know - it\'s crazy we made it through the last few days of August without Dan Duquette optioning anybody to the GCL this year. I wonder if he wept about it.

If you annualized those numbers, he would have 16 home runs, 48 doubles, and 128 RBIs.I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason to not include Clevenger significantly in plans for 2016. He can be a back-up catcher and first baseman, while also being a primary designated hitter against right-handed pitching.

09/04/2015,"[(""Projecting what the Orioles' bullpen will look like in ..."", "" Yesterday, our fearless leader Mark Brown\xc2\xa0wrote about how there are still some things to be excited about during the dumpster fire that has been the last month or so of the Orioles' season. Today, I wanted to take a closer look at one of them: the bullpen.    The 'pen has been one of the lone successes of the 2015 season. While everyone expected the bullpen to be near the top of the league, and\xc2\xa0I predicted they'd be the 2nd best in the division, it has outperformed even those expectations. The bullpen is fifth in baseball in ERA, and they're doing it while throwing a lot of innings behind a below average starting rotation.\xc2\xa0Zach Britton and Darren O'Day have repeated their excellent performances from 2014, and they've been supported by career years from Brian Matusz and Brad Brach. When pitchers that were expected to important parts of the bullpen succumbed to either injury (Wesley Wright) or ineffectiveness (Tommy Hunter), the bullpen was stabilized by effective performances from former unknowns like Chaz Roe and Mychal Givens. Unfortunately, the O's will probably be losing at least one of their key bullpen contributors from this year. Darren O'Day is a free agent, and with the amount of money the team will need to spend to improve elsewhere there is definitely a question of if he'll return. And Brian Matusz will be entering his fourth year of arbitration, which means his price will reach a point that the Orioles might not be willing to meet. He's making around $3 million now and that number should go up. With only one year of real success under his belt, it may not be worth it to pay $4-5 million for an unspectacular LOOGY. Barring an implosion in September, O'Day will be coming off his fourth straight season with an ERA under 2.30, and his second straight with an ERA under 2.\xc2\xa0He is awesome. While I don't see an Andrew Miller contract in his future, O'Day is going to get paid. Giving big contracts to relievers is rarely worth it due to reliever volatility and the fact that they simply don't pitch that many innings - I don't think the Orioles will be the team to make that mistake this time. Matusz, meanwhile, is having by far the best season of his career, which could mean a huge raise via arbitration.    Assuming neither O'Day nor Matusz return, the O's are left with Britton, Brach, and Mychal Givens as the three guys who are basically locks to start the 2016 season in the bullpen. Givens has shown flashes of being really, really good, and it wouldn't be surprising to see him slide right into O'Day's role as the 8th inning man next season. Brach has been great lately as well, and I think the role he's in right now suits him the best - a 6th or 7th inning guy who can sometimes throw an extra inning or two if needed.    Chaz Roe will be back, and he'll be cheap - anyone who can throw a slider\xc2\xa0this GIF-worthy probably has the stuff to stick around in the bigs. Roe can essentially replace Tommy Hunter as the 3rd right handed arm behind Givens and Brach. T.J. McFarland isn't going anywhere, either, especially with the team potentially losing a lefty in Brian Matusz. He's due for an arbitration raise, but he should still be on the cheap side. That leaves two more spots. One will most likely go to a lefty. That might be Matusz or it might be a new face - a cheaper version of Matusz signed via free agency, along the lines of the Wesley Wright deal this year (but hopefully with a little more success). It's also possible that the O's might think they already have that guy in someone like Cesar Cabral or Chris Jones.    The last spot is interesting. My prediction is a bit of a wild card:\xc2\xa0Dylan Bundy. It's easy to forget about Bundy these days thanks to all of his injury issues, and it's also easy to forget that he is out of options since he's made a grand total of two major league appearances. But he is, so he must be placed on the 25-man roster for 2016 if the O's want to retain him. This is a tough spot - it's highly unlikely he'll be good enough to pitch in the rotation come April, but he can't be sent to the minors. If this sounds familiar, it's because the O's faced the same dilemma with Zach Britton. We all know how that went. If I was a betting man (I actually am, but I don't know how to bet on this), I'd bet that Bundy starts the year as an unknown commodity in the major league bullpen just like Britton did in 2014. This year Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette have shown how committed they can be to keeping a future asset on the 25-man roster when they have to, even if he may not be major league ready. If they'd do it with Jason Garcia, why wouldn't they do it with Bundy? The can also try to hide him on the DL, but that will only work for so long. The reality is they're not going to let Bundy go for free, so at some point he'll need to pitch at the major league level in 2016. Might as well get it over with. Speaking of Jason Garcia, he's actually looked pretty good since his return from the DL, but he's also available to be optioned once he's gotten through this season. I'm guessing he'll start the year in Norfolk and be one of the first call-ups when an extra bullpen arm is needed.    Potentially losing O'Day and Matusz is certainly going to hurt the Baltimore bullpen next season. But a bullpen of Britton, Givens, Brach, Roe, MacFarland, Matusz or (insert lefty here), and Bundy could still be one of the better groups in the league. Let's just hope that unlike in 2015, next year's bullpen isn't one of the only things worth getting excited about.

Surely he was the man, after his very strong performance at the end of 2014. But in 19 games and 72 at-bats he only hit .167.

But in 38 games and 119 at-bats he only hit for a .218 average, and with only two home runs. A disappointment for sure. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone.The most actual games in left field this year is surprisingly David Lough. Many of these were for late innings defense.

It did not seem unreasonable to me to hope that one of the aforementioned players would step up and claim the job as a regular. But it never happened.So what is the future? Could it be Urrutia? That is not the expectation by many, but gosh, he certainly would have done better than the stats in the chart above.What if Gerardo Parra were to be signed in the offseason? Especially if Dariel Alvarez becomes the next right fielder? Well, Parra proves that there is a curse out there in that corner of Camden Yards, as he is hitting .125 in his six games at the #7 defensive position.As always, the answer will be tied to other spending the Orioles may do \xe2\x80\xa6 like trying to keep Chris Davis and addressing other holes and needs.

Most of the moves that they made this season in aquiring players such as David Price\xc2\xa0(among others) were heralded as great. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been celebrated for the past month or so as an organization that\xe2\x80\x99s committed to winning.And for this year it appears that they are. However think back to last off season; after they seemingly pulled back their interest in Duquette it became fairly obvious that they might make another run at him this coming off season. However with their recent hire of Indians\xe2\x80\x99 President Mark Shapiro as their new President and CEO, that now appears unlikely. So Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s the ultimate loser in this given that he\xe2\x80\x99s now the head of an organization with questions, right?Maybe not. The Orioles have question marks going into next season for sure (in terms of the makeup of the roster), however which franchise has a brighter future in general is a very interesting question. Toronto sent some very quality prospects out of their organization in order to acquire the likes of Price and others. Where do those moves leave their farm system?Toronto did what they felt they had to do for themselves at the time, so in that sense they probably did the right thing. If the goal is to win in 2015, that is. And yes, that should always be the goal. But the Orioles are trying to build something that\xe2\x80\x99s sustainable in terms of a winner. This is not to say that the Birds haven\xe2\x80\x99t dealt prospects, because they have \xe2\x80\x93 this year, in fact.

He has fared even worse in three starts north of the border, allowing 19 runs. His ERA at Rogers Centre this season is 19.73.""It\'s not something they\'re doing as much as where Chris is getting the ball,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.

Ben Revere singled and scored on Donaldson\'s double to left.

Toronto was 50-51 following a loss to Philadelphia on July 28, the day after the Blue Jays acquired Tulowitzki from Colorado.

Donaldson hit a sacrifice fly before Bautista and Encarnacion each hit RBI doubles.""With very few exceptions, we didn\'t make many good pitches,"" Showalter said.Marco Estrada (12-8) pitched five innings for his first win in three starts. He allowed two runs and two hits, struck out four and walked four.Baltimore\'s Ryan Flaherty hit a two-run homer in the fifth, and Jimmy Paredes had an RBI double off LaTroy Hawkins in the sixth.

Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsIt is difficult to know what to say or write about the 2015 Baltimore Orioles that has not been said by O\xe2\x80\x99s writers everywhere. This is largely due to the fact that there is not a great deal of diversity or new material to comment upon due to the outcome of these late-season games.In dropping the series finale 10-4 to the Blue Jays on Sunday afternoon, the Orioles displayed a number of too common traits: falling behind early, generating little offense against the opposition starter, and by the time they begin to score some runs, they are too little, too late.The Orioles have lost 14 of the past 17 games. Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s was the first time however that the Orioles scored more than three runs in one of those losses. Is that a scoop for a story? If so, we would be writing about how the fourth run scored on a Nolan Reimold homer in his first game back after being DFA\xe2\x80\x99d and playing briefly for the Norfolk Tides.The current seasonal situation facing the Orioles is about like being four or five runs behind going into the ninth inning. What are the chances of winning such a game? Not good, especially this year where such a thing has not happened. Even if the Orioles win 20 of the 26 remaining games, they would be 85-77; and that might not be good enough to get them into the playoffs.Once about every five games, the Orioles break out the big bats like we used to see, and fly balls start going over the walls. Pitchers make critical pitches to get out of tight situations. And we fans get our hopes up that it is the beginning of a big turnaround.But nope. It is not going to happen this year. There are a lot of reasons and explanations. More on that in coming months.But right now \xe2\x80\xa6 is it more that the pitchers are afraid to throw for fear of giving up too much, attempting to be too perfect because they know they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get much run support? Or is it more a matter that the hitters press too much, swinging wildly at bad pitches in an aggressive effort to score now \xe2\x80\xa6 fearing that the pitching is not going to keep them in the game?

Put it together and you have a sub-.500 team, even while loaded with a ton of talent that should be playing at a much higher level.Let\xe2\x80\x99s see today what Wei-Yin Chen can do in New York. And what can the Orioles do against Michael Pineda? He has been far from fantastic this year, but this O\xe2\x80\x99s collection of banged-up, slumping, fill-ins, etc. could well make him look like a Cy Young candidate.The typical sort of O\xe2\x80\x99s game would be for Chen to give up two runs in the first inning, a solo shot in the third or fourth, and then a fourth run in about the sixth inning when he runs out of steam. Meanwhile, the Orioles will blow one opportunity after another, getting one run in the first five innings and another one or two when Pineda fades out in the seventh. But Dellin Betances and company will not allow any more offense at all, while the Yankees win 5-3.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Bird Bomb Beats the Birds', 'Sep 7, 2015; Bronx, NY, USA; Baltimore Orioles relief pitcher Brian Matusz (17) pitches against the New York Yankees during the seventh inning at Yankee Stadium.

Brian Matusz was called upon to face left-handed hitting Greg Bird \xe2\x80\x94 a rookie first baseman in his 22nd career game, filling in for the injured Mark Teixeira. Surely the youngster would be no match for the lefty specialist.Matusz started him off with a pair of strikes on 92-mph four-seamers. He fouled off the first and watched the second for a called strike. So, since he proved he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hit that pitch, the obvious choice was to change it to a hanging 83-mph slider in the middle of the plate on a 0-2 pitch! Gone!

The Bird homer was the 99th hit this season on 0-2 counts given up by O\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers. That is tops in the American League along with the Tigers and Twins \xe2\x80\x93 give or take one or two hits. The next highest number after that is in the 70s, with the league average at 61.Of the 99 hits allowed on a 0-2 count by the Orioles this year, 17 have been for doubles, 2 for triples, and 8 for home runs. Opponents are batting .209 in these situations. Of course, an average of .209 is not considered good, but on 0-2 counts it is actually rather fabulous!It is not as if an unusual number of terrible things have happened to Orioles pitchers after 0-2 counts when pitching around batters. Only 33 times over the entire season has a 0-2 count eventuated in a base on balls, whereas it has rather led to 453 strikeouts.And it is not like it is deep baseball strategy to know to pitch off the plate on 0-2 counts. This is even done in Little League baseball. So to groove or hang a pitch in the middle of the plate in MLB is inexcusable and intolerable.To just look at Matusz\xe2\x80\x99 numbers, one would think him to be a highly effective relief pitcher, and often he is. He has a 2.40 ERA over 45 innings with a WHIP of 1.13. \xc2\xa0Opponents are hitting .198 off him. But 11 of 33 inherited runners have scored this year. In 2014 it was 10 of 49, and just 5 of 37 in 2013.Now with a record of 65-72, the Orioles will need to go 16-9 in the final 25 games just to make it to .500.\xc2\xa0 Geez!

If you go to the minor leagues, the team is seeing success.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 AAA affiliate, the Norfolk Tides, won the International League South over the Gwinnett Braves by one game.This is despite the constant roller coaster the AAA team endured, using so many different players. Eighteen people started a game for the Tides, and the team used 30 different pitchers.The team nearly used as many position players, using 26 of them, with only five players (Christian Walker, Michael Almanzar, Dariel Alvarez, Henry Urrutia, and Julio Borbon Jr.) playing more than 100 games.That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only level where the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 organization saw success. The Bowie Baysox also won their division, winning the Eastern League Western division by five games over the Altoona Curve.The Baysox were led by two very different starters. Terry Doyle, a minor league journeyman, went 12-1 with a 1.97 ERA. Joe Gunkel, acquired by the Orioles for Alejandro De Aza, started the most games for the Baysox, showing his ability as a potential future starter in the major leagues.Leading the Baysox offensively was a three-headed crew of Trey Mancini, Quincy Latimore and Mike Yastrzemski. Latimore led the team in hits, HR and 2B. Mancini led the team in average with an average of .359.The team\xe2\x80\x99s two single A teams did not make the playoffs, but both had seasons where they finished toward the top half of their divisions.Despite this minor league success, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 farm system is largely considered to be weak by national pundits. That is likely because some of the best players this year were journeymen, not top prospects.Latimore and Doyle will never be major league players. But both stepped up in a big way this year for the minor league Orioles.The question now is what moves this team makes to be successful for 2016, both at the major and minor league levels.Next: A single Bird beats The Birds ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Greg Bird\\u2019s Walk Aids Yankees, and His Homer Wins Game ...', '     Supported by    Baseball |                            Yankees 8, Orioles 6                                                             Greg Bird\xe2\x80\x99s Walk Aids Yankees, and His Homer Wins Game  By SETH BERKMANSEPT. 7, 2015    Continue reading the main story Share This Page  Continue reading the main story                if (             window.magnum             && window.magnum.getFlags().indexOf(\'headlineBalancer\') > 0             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.shouldRun()         ) {             window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize();         }         Photo       The rookie first baseman Greg Bird hitting a seventh-inning homer that drove in Carlos Beltran and Chris Young and put the Yankees ahead, 8-5.

The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Wei-Yin Chen threw Bird an inside pitch, and Bird, a 22-year-old rookie, winced as if he had been hit.The acting was underwhelming. After ruling that the ball had fouled off the bottom of Bird\xe2\x80\x99s bat, the plate umpire, Clint Fagan, called Bird back into the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box. Bird later said that he knew the pitch had nicked his bat but that he was scared and caught off guard.In the end, Bird coaxed out a free base by drawing a walk that set up John Ryan Murphy for a two-run homer. That blast put the Yankees on top of a seesaw battle, 5-4.In the seventh, after the Orioles had tied the game on a Manny Machado home run, Bird came through in more striking fashion, hitting a three-run shot over the right-field wall, and the Yankees held on for an 8-6 win at home.

09/10/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Score Four, Wins More for O\\u2019s', 'Sep 9, 2015; Bronx, NY, USA; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Steve Pearce (28) watches his game winning solo home run against the New York Yankees in the eighth inning at Yankee Stadium. The Orioles defeated the Yankees 5-3. Mandatory Credit: Andy Marlin-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles put together an all-around good game on Wednesday evening in New York by defeating the Yankees 5-3. Ubaldo Jimenez gave them their first quality start in 14 games, the offense tallied five runs, the defense was typically good, and the bullpen did the O\xe2\x80\x99Day / Britton shutdown thing in the 8th/9th to save the lead.After the Orioles scored their first three runs on two totally bonehead defensive plays by Stephen Drew, the go-ahead and game-winning run was a homer by Steve Pearce. The long fly was hit off Adam Warren in the 7th inning, though Pearce just missed getting enough of two other fly balls earlier off CC Sabathia.Much has been made over the past several years about the magic number of four or more runs scored being the key to winning games. I chaff at that and have written against this notion as overly simplistic, but honestly the statistics are difficult to argue against.Year< 4 Runs4+ RunsTotal201510-5457-1867-72201421-5175-1596-66201316-4659-3185-77201221-5272-1793-69\xc2\xa0Those are very impressive numbers for sure. But to be honest, probably every team has a broadly similar story. For example, the Kansas City Royals are 18-43 and 65-13 this year in the same categories (which does reflect their better overall pitching); and they were 20-59 / 69-14.Ubaldo Jimenez had good ball movement, which he usually does. We know that is not the problem. The home run he yielded was actually on a ball outside the strike zone and the other two runs scored on a poorly-hit ball. It is all about command, and on this night he struck out eight while walking none in his seven innings.

Teams tend to wait him out to see if he will lose control, multiply free passes, aim and groove a strike, and generally run up his pitch count and become vulnerable. When he pounds the strike zone, he is among the best; when he does not, he is among the worst.The Orioles are one game behind the Rays and one game ahead of the Red Sox\xe2\x80\xa6 not what we expected this year. Also not expected, and still a curiosity to me, is how this New York Yankees team is 16 games over .500.\xc2\xa0 There is simply nothing very special about it all beyond the bullpen, but they have found ways to win games while other have found ways to lose them.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles minor league recap: Both Norfolk and Bowie start ...', "" Columbus Clippers (CLE) 5, Norfolk Tides 2 The Tides were never really in this games, as both of their runs came in the bottom of the ninth inning. Starting pitcher Terry Doyle, who was coming off of a string of good starts, just fell apart. He gave up eight hits and two walks in just 4 2/3 innings, which resulted in five runs for the Clippers. The big blow came in the fifth inning when Doyle gave up five straight hits with one out. His defense saved him one run as right fielder Henry Urrutia and second baseman Sharlon Schoop combined to throw out a runner at the plate.    Doyle was lifted after that fifth straight hit, and his replacement Richard Rodriguez immediately gave up another run on an RBI single before getting out of the inning. The Clippers didn't score again but it was more than enough. The Tides offense had seven hits and a walk in 6 2/3 innings against Clippers starter Ryan Merritt, but somehow couldn't string enough hits together in a row to score any runs. They had multiple runners on base in three of the first seven innings, but failed. When all ten hits you get in a game are singles, that'll tend to happen. They finally got on the board in the bottom of the ninth, but it was too little, too late. They loaded the bases with no outs on in a very minor-league-type way. Leadoff batter Audry Perez singled, David Lough struck out but reached base on a wild pitch, and Sean Halton walked. The Clippers pitcher, Jeff Johnson, was pretty wild and got pulled before he could do further damage. He was replaced by Carlos Marmol - wait, that guy is still around? He did his job, and the only runs scored by the Tides were on a ground out and and error. Urrutia struck out looking to end the game.    As for individual performances, Sean Halton had a nice game with three singles and a walk. Christian Walker and Audry Perez had two hits apiece.    The Tides and Clippers face off again tonight at 6:36. Chris Jones will be on the mound for the good guys. Altoona Curve (PIT) 8, Bowie Baysox 7 Oh, this one was a heartbreaker. The Baysox took a 7-5 lead into the bottom of the ninth but couldn't hold it as Andrew Triggs blew the save.    The Baysox offense broke out for a seven-run second inning where they sent 12 batters to the plate. They loaded the bases with no outs to start the inning, then the first run of the game came in on a wild pitch. Glynn Davis followed that with a two-RBI double to make the score 3-0, and two batters later Mike Yastrzemski singled Davis in. Trey Mancini then reached on an error that allowed Corban Joseph, who had also reached on an error, to score. It wasn't until the ninth batter of the inning, Quincy Latimore, came to the plate that the Curve recorded its first out. He and Sisco struck out back-to-back before Garabez Rosa singled in yet another run. By the time Drew Dosch grounded out to end the inning, the Baysox had scored seven run on five hits, a walk, and three errors by the other team. Unfortunately they didn't score again, and the Curve chipped away at their lead with a single run in the fourth and then four runs in the fifth. Baysox starter Joe Gunkel gave up a walk and two singles to load the bases with one out, then gave up a grand slam to Barrett Barnes. Oops. He wasn't helped by his defense as one of those guys on base should have been out via a foul pop up, but Trey Mancini literally dropped the ball.    That was all of the scoring until the dreaded bottom of the ninth. Having already pitched a 1-2-3 eighth inning, Andrew Triggs came back out to try and close things out. He did not. He gave up a two-run homer to tie the game, and then an error by shortstop Ozzie Martinez allowed the winning run to get to second base to set up the walk-off hit. What a horrible way to lose, especially in the postseason. Both Yastrzemski and Rosa had three hits, including a double, in the game. Trey Mancini was 0-for-5 with an error in the field. Game two of this series is tonight at 6 p.m. Nick Additon is scheduled to start for the Baysox.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

And there can be no doubt that 9/11 rocked the very fabric of America \xe2\x80\x93 for those of us who lived through it. And I now have to find myself throwing that last bit in, because there are already kids in schools who are seeing 9/11 only through the lenses of history books as opposed to first-hand experience.For those who care, I was a junior in college at the time. I had a course from 9-10:15 AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays on the American Presidency. Ironically, that day we had talked about the special war powers of the President, and I clearly recall the professor saying that none of us in our lifetimes had ever seen them put to use. Little did we know what was going on and the havoc it would cause right as we were learning that.As I walked to my next course, I started to hear the news of what was happening. And when it hit me in full, I took a step back and kind of took in my surroundings. And I knew at that moment that for the rest of my life I\xe2\x80\x99d never forget being right there looking at academic buildings under green trees and blue skies when I heard the news.And all of you have your stories of where you were and so forth. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll all carry those with us forever. As we know, 9/11 shut down Major League Baseball for the better part of a week. The NFL also postphoned it\xe2\x80\x99s games that weekend. Outside of recovery efforts, mourning, and essential functions of life, time seemed to stop in America for a period of time.But that\xe2\x80\x99s par for the course in our country. As I said,\xc2\xa0some events rock the world. And thus we owe it to time itself to stand back and take note. There was a lot of uncertainty in those subsequent days and weeks. However one of the great marks of America is how we recover. Eventually the crowds returned to the ballparks, and the screams of\xc2\xa0play ball! were heard. Eventually the NFL returned, and life came back to as normal as it could in America.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

After Adam Jones singled, Morales hit Davis in the back with a pitch. Davis slammed down his bat, breaking it in two, as Showalter sprinted out of the dugout.No one else emerged from either dugout during the potentially volatile situation, although Davis glared at Morales while taking his base.\xe2\x80\x9cWe hit a grand slam, another home run, a couple rockets,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just didn\xe2\x80\x99t look right, regardless of whether it was on purpose or not.\xe2\x80\x9dShowalter thought it was, and was ejected for arguing that point.Thus, he missed what happened next: Morales lasted one more batter before being replaced by Joba Chamberlain, who yielded Clevenger\xe2\x80\x99s slam.

Baltimore must win 13 of its last 22 games just to finish .500.The Royals\xe2\x80\x99 early 3-0 lead dwindled to 4-3 before Rios led off the seventh with a drive off Brad Brach \xe2\x80\x94 his first home run since July 17.

However Kansas City chipped away \xe2\x80\x93 as they love to do. Hosmer\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single in the sixth cut the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead to 4-2. Moustakas added a two-RBI single, and suddenly we were tied.\xc2\xa0To top things off, Perez\xe2\x80\x99s two-RBI single later in the inning gave Kansas City a lead, which ran to 7-4 after Cain\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double.Courtesy of Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY SportsAnd that brought us to the moment of truth involving Showalter and common sense. With lefty T.J. McFarland onto pitch with runners on second and third (with one gone), the situation called for Showalter to intentionally walk Kansas City\xe2\x80\x99s Morales with Moustakas (who hits from the left side) on deck. Mind you, both hitters are dangerous, and both have had their successes against the Orioles. But opting to match up in that scenario is the right thing to do.Unfortunately, that decision backfired. Moustakas decided that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t important out of which hand the ball was coming, and he lifted a grand slam to right field. That\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps the most frustrating part of this from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 and Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s standpoint. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stress enough that the reasoning was sound. Thus the appearance is that Showalter made the wrong decision \xe2\x80\x93 for the right reason. But from the perspective of most fans, all that will be said was that the wrong decision was made.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

However in the top of the ninth Moustakas\xe2\x80\x99 spot came up in the order again. And go figure, he had two runners on base in front of him. So after Moustakas further drove a stake through the Orioles on this night with a three-run homer, he had nine RBI on the night in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 14-6 loss.On one hand you can say that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how sound the reasoning is if it fails. However on the other hand, it\xe2\x80\x99s no coincidence that the idea of mathing up is considered sound reasoning.

And it\xe2\x80\x99s players who are often tried and true that are doing the failing. So what gives?As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, I suspect that teams are ready for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 match ups. And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put it past teams to perhaps work on hitting off of someone who throws from the other side in anticipation of some of these moves. But Showalter walking a heavy hitter to match up is one of the oldest tricks in the book.

It was good to see Adam Jones connect for a three-run shot to give the Birds a 4-1 lead at the time.Also hitting well in recent games is Nolan Reimold, who hit another homer in this game while also singling. Over the past six games since his recall, he is hitting .333 on 7-for-21 with five walks and a hit-by-pitch. That\xe2\x80\x99s an OBP of .481.Reimold can be an effective leadoff hitter, even without the base-stealing threat. He does have good speed. But at the plate he works pitchers and gets a lot of walks, so he is on base more often than his average would suggest. He has fairly even splits left and right. But the key to him having success is that he needs to be run out there with some regularity. He is not a player who can perform well in a platooning situation.As we near the end of this disappointing season, a postmortem is going to include this idea of shuffling players and the ways that it has hurt performance. Yes, it starts with underperformance, beginning with the corner outfielders\xe2\x80\x94most of whom are gone from the O\xe2\x80\x99s now.

It\xe2\x80\x99s being written to look back at an important moment in franchise history, which occurred one year ago today. You know the event I mean; I believe it was known in these parts as\xc2\xa0Clinch-mas?!One year ago this evening, the O\xe2\x80\x99s defeated Toronto to lay claim to the American League East crown for the first time since 1997. (Again, the purpose of this article is to focus on that event and what it meant to the city \xe2\x80\x93 not what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the 12 months since then, be it good or bad.) If my memory serves me, it was a beautiful day around town just as today is. However there was a nervous energy around the area all day. People knew what was going down, and they knew what it meant. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they knew quite how it would go down.\xc2\xa0Live Feed adam jonesFergie Jenkins explains why steroid users should not be in the Hall of Fame FanSidedBengals' Adam Jones loses temper after his car is wrecked Stripe HypeDraftKings MLB Picks For May 9 Fantasy CPRLeBron James reacts to Adam Jones situation in Boston (Video) FanSidedAdam Jones ejected in 5th inning at Fenway Park vs. Red Sox for arguing (Video) FanSidedBaltimore Orioles' Adam Jones on pace for his best season yet The Baltimore WireSpeaking for myself, the two takeaways I\xe2\x80\x99ll always have from that night are Adam Jones pieing\xc2\xa0fans, and the slow and broad smile that broke over the face of\xc2\xa0Nick Markakis\xc2\xa0when he realized he was an AL East champion. That was a moment to savor forever in Baltimore, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that I hope the fans will never forget.Division titles are won every year; but most franchises don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait 17 years between them. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a big reason why it was such a huge moment for this franchise and for the Orioles fans. They say that absence makes the heart fonder, and in reality it\xe2\x80\x99s really true. There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole generation of kids who had never seen the Orioles as anything more than losers at the hands of Boston and New York. But the 2014 team put them and everyone else on notice to the effect that the past was the past.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAnd yes, September 16, 2014 is very much in the past now. However I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure anything less than a World Series title would bring back the energy that we saw in the city on that day, and of course the next day \xe2\x80\x93 in the wake of the division crown.

It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite a world series title, but it was pretty huge. I suspect that my calls for nobody to mention what has happened since then are probably going to be ignored. Someone\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to leave a comment to the effect that it\xe2\x80\x99s effectively meaningless since they didn\xe2\x80\x99t win it all, or that the luster is gone since this year hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shaped up the way they wanted\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6but I would submit that makes it more special.

The Orioles won their series with the Red Sox, though last night's 10-1 loss was pretty ugly. They have now won three straight series in a row, and look to make it a fourth against the Rays.   The Rays are 70-75, one game behind the Orioles in the division. This is the last time the Orioles have to face them this year, which means it's the last time for six months or so I'll be subjected to watching a game at Tropicana Field. Watching the games on TV are so bad, I can't even imagine what it must be like to actually go there. Pitching Matchups: Thursday: Chris Tillman vs. Matt Moore Tillman has regressed back to the pitcher he was for most of the first half after it looked like he may have righted the ship. In general the Orioles' starters seem to be doing better lately, maybe that will hold up for him too.    Here's a stat that bodes well for the Orioles - Moore has gone five innings or fewer in nine straight starts. Good to know that the O's are the only team that has guys that can do that.    Friday: Wei-Yin Chen vs. Drew Smyly Chen's probably been the most consistent starter for the O's this season. I'm going to miss him next year. Smyly spent a good part of the season on the DL, but has been pretty good since returning. Hard to believe the Tigers gave him to get David Price and now he's on to Toronto while Smyly is under team control for the next few years.    Saturday: Kevin Gausman vs. Erasmo Ramirez Gausman finally got his first win in more than a month the other night against the Red Sox. He still didn't get much run support, but this time it was enough. It would be nice to see him make it two in a row. Ramirez just pitched against the Orioles on September 2nd and gave up four runs in four innings. On the other hand, he also got within a couple innings of throwing a no-hitter against the Yankees. Looking back over his starts this season though, that outing against the O's seems more typical. Sunday: Ubaldo Jimenez vs. Jake Odorizzi Jimenez is another starter who turned in a pretty good outing his last time out. Again, going into next year, it would be pretty nice if he could prove he can do it a couple times in a row and prove maybe he could be more like the starter he was in the first half of this season, rather than the second half.    Odorizzi is a good pitcher who's having a decent year. Most of the Orioles don't have a good record against him, but Adam Jones is 8 for 17 with a home run. He's really turned it back on lately, things are more fun when Jones is hitting. Other Notes: - Evan Longoria leads this team with 19 home runs. 19. The Orioles may not be having a great year, but if they were having a bad year AND a boring offense, that would be worse - right? - Their offense really is bad too. Their 3.84 runs per game average is worst in the AL and above only the Marlins and Braves. - It was right around this time in 2013 when the Orioles went to Tampa Bay for a four game series that resulted in a sweep by the Rays that really put the nail in the coffin of the O's that year. It still hurts. Prediction: Eh - I'm going to take the easy way out and say they split the series. Though a four game sweep on either side really wouldn't surprise me at this point.

', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Five free agents that would fit the Duquette philosophy ...', ' Despite the disappointing summer and impending playoff couch-sitting Orioles fans are set to undergo, the end of the regular season means the piling of free-agent speculation.    Dan Duquette is a shrewd operator, one reason as to why the O\'s were AL East champions a season ago, and one reason why the Orioles were terrible, no good and very bad for most of the 2015 schedule. If there has been a lesson in 2015, it is capitalizing on production where expectations may be absent. The Steve Pearce\'s, Bud Norris\'s Delmon Young\'s and Zach Britton\'s of \'14 were not brought into Opening Day on a pedestal, but their contributions were substantial. The Travis Snider\'s and Bud Norris\'s of \'15, however, showed the domino effects of struggling role players on a team that consists of only 25 men. Duquette is smart. He is the kind of general manager that fits well in Baltimore because he understands how to operate within his limits. The Travis Snider deal was praised by many geeks and bloggers alike leading into the \'15 season. Snider\'s second-half numbers were promising, and his potential as a sneaky good defensive outfielder with a rising OPS and first-round talent seemed to make sense given the low fiscal commitment. It didn\'t pan out, but it was an educated attempt to replicate previous production. That\'s how Duquette has adapted into this new generation of baseball, and there isn\'t any sign he\'s going to stray from his blueprint. Unlike last winter, the Orioles aren\'t going to be able to simply cruise through the cold months with fans thinking ""Oh, they have a plan"", because the plan failed. There has to be an intent, but most of Birdland is probably going to be disappointed when the likes of Yoenis Cespedes or Jason Heyward aren\'t patrolling Camden Yards. The good thing is, there is still plenty of value to be found.    Based on recent history, the current state of the Orioles and the sample size of Duquette\'s brand of general managing, here are a few guys that wouldn\'t riddle me shocked if they were donning the white and orange in 2016.    1. Matt Joyce            (Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA Today Sports) For Joyce, the move from Tampa to Los Angeles hasn\'t been the smoothest of transitions. After slashing .250/.342/.435 in six seasons with the Rays, Joyce\'s line in his only season with the Halos stands at an unholy .176/.275/.295, and along the way, has been out-platooned by the likes of David Murphy, Shane Victorino and others. Throughout his career however, whenever Joyce has come to Baltimore, he\'s made himself at home, hitting .322/.407/.587 in 47 career games at Camden Yards, including 7 HRs and 27 RBIs in only 167 plate appearances. Granted, the pitching he\'s faced when playing the Orioles has never inspired awe, but unlike Bryce Harper, Joyce finds comfort in hitting in what is universally a hitter-friendly ballpark, especially for lefties.       Matt Joyce Career Splits AVG OPS HR BB/K   Versus Righties .253 .796 84 0.63   Versus Lefties .180 .554 9 0.24      His righty/lefty splits are tremendously valleyed, but Buck Showalter understands how and when to utilize his roster in order to unlock that little extra something. At 31, Joyce isn\'t young, but he\'s certainly not past the point of reclamation. From 2011-13, Joyce had three consecutive years in which he knocked no less than 17 HRs, and from personal experience, I like the kind of player that Joyce is and may still be. Even better for the Orioles, Joyce is currently operating on low-risk, high-reward territory with the year he\'s had with the Angels. 2. Jaime Garcia            (Credit: Jeff Hanisch-USA Today Sports) The Cardinals are facing the dilemma of giving Jaime Garcia an $11.5M option for 2016, or moving on from the oft-injured lefty with a $500K buyout.    In this hypothetical world, the steady Cardinals decide to move on from Garcia (a decision that will likely fly under the radar), and call on the services of a youngster, possibly Marco Gonzales or Tim Cooney. Garcia is certainly a risk for any team that would think of negotiating for his services, but his track record shows a pitcher that fits the Orioles needs. In his career, Garcia owns a solid 3.32 ERA with a 1.26 WHIP, a BB% of only 6.8% and a GB rate of 56.5%. In 2015, the 29 year-old Mexican has sunk and tricked opposing batters to a 62.5 GB%, but with only 104.1 innings this year, he doesn\'t qualify among the league leaders, but if he did, his ground ball rate would be second among starting pitchers in all of baseball. Even the casual fan knows the importance of ground balls at a park like Camden Yards and with a defense that the Orioles are presumably ready to bring back in 2016. The injury concerns are very real, considering Garcia only pitched 89 innings between 2013-14 because of a triad of left-arm issues, including\xc2\xa0Tommy John surgery, labrum and rotator cuff surgery and even thoracic acid output surgery. Perhaps out of hope or my readiness to move on, but I\'m not so sure that Wei-Yin Chen will be back with the O\'s following the end of this season. Garcia has a leadership quality about him that makes him a slide-in candidate to pitch at an ace-level without the expectations, pretty much what he\'s done throughout his time with the Cardinals. Garcia\'s skillset, calm demeanor and possible middle-of-the-road value would fit in very well in the Orioles\' clubhouse, while providing a solid lefty presence in the rotation. 3. Brett Anderson            (Credit: Jake Roth-USA Today Sports) On the topic of Jaime Garcia, there was a tidbit regarding his ground ball rate and that it would stand at second among starting pitchers had he qualified for enough innings. Well, there is one guy that sits ahead of Garcia. His name? Brett Anderson. Anderson was picked up by the Dodgers as a flier, signing for $10M on a one-year deal after an injury-riddled few seasons with the Rockies and Athletics, and in \'15, the 27 year-old lefty is making his mark once again.    The same rules apply for Anderson as it did with Garcia: injuries, redemption, ground balls, replacing Chen, etc. Anderson will probably come at a higher cost than Garcia, but the soon-to-be 28 year old is probably a less risky proposition. Whether or not the Orioles splurge on Anderson is a discussion for another day, but this year\'s starting rotation has made this a fairly one-sided argument. 4. Ross Detwiler            (Credit: Kamil Krzaczynski-USA Today Sports) Detwiler looked special coming up through the minors and into the big leagues with the Nationals, a big 6\'5 lefty with a power arm that had a knack for strikeouts. With an upward trending career trajectory, Detwiler looked like he was worth the sixth-overall pick in the 2007 Amateur Draft, especially in 2012 when he threw 164.1 innings with a 3.40 ERA, 1.22 WHIP and .263 opponent BABIP. Those days are long gone. Detwiler has battled shoulder and leg issues since rising onto the scene, and in 2015, his production has revolved into a mighty downwards spike. In 58.1 innings in \'15, Detwiler has accumulated a 7.25 ERA, 2.02 WHIP and .369 opponent BABIP. He\'s gotten hit hard, and he\'s gotten hit often, but he seems like a tremendous bounce-back candidate come this winter. He\'s a former first-round pick, something Duquette very much likes, and despite the ugly stat-line, there is still a mid-90\'s fastball with solid speed differential to his off-speed pitches, making him an easy choice to bring into Spring Training. Perhaps a foundation can unlock a pitcher that looks a lot like a poor man\'s Andrew Miller. 5. Justin Upton           (Credit: Jake Roth-USA Today Sports) Zach Davies for Gerardo Parra doesn\'t really sound so bad considering the price tag that had been on Justin Upton around the trade deadline. Upton had an Orioles-like June and July, slashing a combined .179/.266/.314 with only 6 HRs and 19 RBIs in 46 games. His summer decline has somewhat made folks forget about him, and for the most part, that\'s something the Orioles can only benefit from.    Since August, Upton has returned to terrorizing the opposition, hitting .272/.373/.530 with 8 HRs and 19 RBIs in 42 games.    Justin Upton 2015 Splits OPS HR ISO wRC+ BB%   First Half   .753 14  .169 110 10.2%   Second Half .894 12  .281 145 12.0%      Despite a couple of consecutively unfruitful months, Upton has pretty much been right where his career track says he should be, hitting .255/.340/.465 with 26 dingers and 83 RBIs in 139 games this season. His slightly-less-than-Adam-Jones stat line is the kind of output that the Orioles desperately missed in 2015, and if there is any player for Duquette to make an investment on, Upton is undoubtedly the guy. A pair of teams are going to quickly act on Heyward and Cespedes, leaving Upton as the remaining corner outfielder in which a serious financial commitment would make sense. The former number-one overall pick is a brute force that you can plug in left field and anywhere from 3-6 in an everyday lineup, providing not only the slugging threat the Orioles need, but the actual power production as well. Let\'s say the Orioles maneuver the budget around to not only pay Chris Davis and Gerardo Parra (who I very much like as a ballplayer), but Justin Upton as well. A one through six of Parra, Machado, Jones, Davis, Upton and Schoop would go a long way to offset what is likely to be an average rotation once again.    Upton is still going to command an AAV of around $20M, but if there was ever a time for Duquette to make a splash, it would most certainly make sense to try to reel in a 28 year-old slugger that would can provide the pure power numbers that helps make the Orioles, well, the Orioles.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsAfter a 2014 season of 96 wins for the Baltimore Orioles, there was every reason to think that even a bit of a drop-off in production would still yield a team that could make the playoffs in 2015. And all along we were saying that probably 87 wins would be enough to make that happen.So, just do it, right?

There is the challenge when doing so of not becoming overly enamored with your subject and losing objectivity about their faults and shortcomings. And no sportswriter wants to be similarly non-objective.Truthfully, this 2015 season is the first that I have picked the Orioles to win the American League East. But I did, though in a closer race with fewer wins and the Jays finishing second. I picked the O\xe2\x80\x99s to have 92 wins in 2014; and we know that they totaled 96. However, I did have them losing to the Rays by three games; and of course, the Rays had tons of injuries and fell apart. The Orioles did a little worse than what I thought in 2013, and just a bit better than my prediction in 2012. I did however think that they would do very well in that breakout year, but did not expect they\xe2\x80\x99d actually make the playoffs.All to say that, right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling a bit stupid for selecting the Orioles to repeat in the A.L. East and have a strong season this year. My reasoning was that, even with the loss of two outfielders, the Orioles were returning the entire rotation that carried them to 96 wins, not even including a $12.5-million guy who had a bad year historically. The only relief loss was a player who was only available for the final one-third of the season. And three All-Stars \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Davis, Manny Machado and Matt Wieters \xe2\x80\x93 who combined to miss a total of 251 games were returning to the regular lineup.\xc2\xa0More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d agoBut, looking back to an article on February 1st, I was talking about how two publications\xe2\x80\x94Baseball Prospectus and FanGraphs\xe2\x80\x94were each predicting the Orioles to finish last with on 78 wins. I hate to admit that they are going to be closer to the eventual truth than I was predicting at the time. But before we see them as baseball gurus, let me add that each were also selecting the Red Sox to win with the Yankees finishing fourth, just ahead of the O\xe2\x80\x99s.It is stuff like this that gives rise to the old adage, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is why they play the games.\xe2\x80\x9dAll I can say to the Orioles right now is, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, just don\xe2\x80\x99t finish last.\xe2\x80\x9dNext: Six things to maintains Orioles interest to the end of season ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Sound reasoning gets another early shower', ""Consistently doing the right thing strategically and having it fail has to be a tough pill to swallow for the Baltimore Orioles. In many cases this year we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\xc2\xa0Buck Showalter\xc2\xa0make moves in games, only to have them backfire on the Birds. In last night\xe2\x80\x99s game, things probably ended up worse than they would have had the Orioles done the wrong thing (and failed).The O\xe2\x80\x99s sent\xc2\xa0Tyler Wilson to the mound last night in a starting role, and with some mixed results.

Longoria\xe2\x80\x99s a heavy hitter, and Sizemore (who was on deck) was much more likely to hit into a double-play. The idea is to stay out of a big inning, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s did the right thing in pitching to Sizemore instead of Longoria\xe2\x80\xa6Courtesy of Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sports\xe2\x80\xa6the only problem was that Sizemore didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the memo that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to do what he ended up doing. Not only did that backfire on the Orioles, but it backfired three-fold. Sizemore hit a bases-clearing triple to give Tampa a 5-3 lead. Let\xe2\x80\x99s use revisionist history for just a moment and say that they had done the \xe2\x80\x9cwrong thing\xe2\x80\x9d and pitched to Longoria. Had he gotten a base hit, only two runs would have scored; instead by doing the right thing, three runs scored. Yeah, that seems fair from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 perspective.And it got worse from there before it got better. Loney and Franklin each added RBI-doubles, and when the smoke cleared the Orioles trailed 8-3. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s double was especially tough to swallow for the Birds, as it was a lazy pop fly that barely made it out of the infield. Schoop thought that Jones would come in from third to get the ball, but he was unable to make it that far.Steve Pearce\xc2\xa0tried to single-handedly bring the Orioles back, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough. His two-run homer in the sixth got them to within 8-5, and his solo shot in the ninth made it 8-6. But Tampa had poured too much on in that fifth inning and they went onto victory.Again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t stress enough that Showalter did the right thing by the book when he walked Longoria. It\xe2\x80\x99s really a shame when you see those moves backfire, because it sends a message that the book in essence should be thrown out. A good manager always thinks several hitters down the line and tries to figure out what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do in a given situation. However opponents are seeming only to focus on getting on base in the here and now \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s hampering the O\xe2\x80\x99s as much as anything.The series continues this evening, knotted up at one.

Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day set up Zach Britton for the save. Chris Davis and Adam Jones were the two players critical to the two runs scored, as between them they had five of the 10 Orioles hits. Great defense served the Birds well throughout the game. The only missing ingredient was the trademark homer or two.Putting these pieces together, this is the Baltimore Orioles team that we signed up for in March\xe2\x80\xa6 not the squad that has the second-worst record in all of baseball in won-loss percentage on the road!The win also puts the Orioles at 10-8 on the season against the Rays, with only Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game remaining.

It would seem to me that Seattle would be a likely place for several reasons, including the larger ballpark. Chen does give up the long fly, as he is #2 in the American League with 28 home runs allowed. Even so, most often they are solo shots. A few balls were just barely foul last night; they could have changed the game completely if just a few feet toward the middle of the field.With one win down and 14 to go, Kevin Gausman gets the start on Sunday afternoon in an effort to get the big winning streak extended.

But I did see the incident in Friday night\xe2\x80\x99s game, which from an employee/boss standpoint rubbed me the wrong way.Chris Johnson of MASNsports wrote about it in this article. It was also covered across various sports media over the weekend. In short, manager\xc2\xa0Matt Williams\xc2\xa0emerged from the Washington dugout in the seventh inning to lift starter\xc2\xa0Max Scherzer. Before I go on, let me preface this by saying that I think Scherzer is one of the best starters in baseball. Any team would be lucky to have him. Furthermore, in what little I see of Washington, I do feel that Williams has a knack for lifting his starters too early and burning out his \xe2\x80\x98pen.\xc2\xa0Live Feed max scherzerWashington Nationals History: Max Scherzer Strikes Out Twenty Call to the PenMLB FanDuel: Daily Pitching Focus May 9 Fantasy CPRDraftKings MLB Picks For May 9 Fantasy CPRWashington Nationals: 5 to watch in Beltway Series District on DeckFanDuel MLB Daily Picks and Pivots - May 4 Fantasy CPRMLB Aces Yu Darvish and Max Scherzer Love Their Pet Dogs Call to the PenBut as a manager, it\xe2\x80\x99s your right to make poor decisions. If they come back to haunt you, at some point you\xe2\x80\x99ll be held accountable. But it\xe2\x80\x99s still your decision how you operate your team between the lines. However on this night, Scherzer appeared to throw a \xe2\x80\x9chissy-fit\xe2\x80\x9d on the mound. Both he and Williams admitted after the game that profanity was in play on Scherzer\xe2\x80\x99s part. Eventually, Williams appeared to appease his starting pitcher and left him in the game.The final result shows that this was the right decision. Because at the end of the day unfortunately that\xe2\x80\x99s how everything seems to be judged nowadays \xe2\x80\x93 by wins and losses. Not so much by what the moment called for. \xc2\xa0So I do agree with Scherzer that Williams shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought about pulling him in that situation. But that\xe2\x80\x99s really beside the point.Courtesy of Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsA relationship between a coach and a player in sports is akin to the one between you and your boss. How many people reading this would have the guts to literally undress their boss in the manner that Scherzer did with Williams? Because Washington ended up winning the game, it\xe2\x80\x99s seen as standing up for what\xe2\x80\x99s right on Scherzer\xe2\x80\x99s part. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also unprofessional \xe2\x80\x93 win or lose.And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing; I partially blame Williams for this. While that might come off as blaming the victim, work with me here for a moment. He obviously decided that he was pulling his starter at that point. As a manager and thus a leader, he has to be decisive in that moment, and thus confident in his decision. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll grant you that his decisions in games have come under constant scrutiny, and perhaps that was in his head. However to be a good coach you have to be a good leader, right?

By turning around and retreating to the dugout, he allowed Max Scherzer to show him up. Again, I suspect that most Washington fans are going to look at it as not being a problem, and perhaps even from the perspective that Williams should have been \xe2\x80\x9cshown up\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 because he was wrong to have tried to pull Scherzer.But look past the game result, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that I\xe2\x80\x99m right. If you manage people in an office, are you really going to allow someone on your team to read you the riot act like that publicly? Please understand; this is not to say that leaders should never listen to their underlings \xe2\x80\x93 because those voices should certainly be heard. Scherzer would have done better to take ten minutes behind closed doors after the game and spoke to Williams in private.But part of being a leader is literally leading. When you allow yourself to be beaten around by someone you\xe2\x80\x99re supposedly managing like that, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t a leader. Take the name of any great coach in sports, and odds are he never let an athlete get out of control like that. Vince Lombardi, Bobby Knight, Phil Jackson, and others come to mind. Heck, think of any boss you\xe2\x80\x99ve had that\xe2\x80\x99s recognized as a great manager. Would that person allow themselves to be publicly humiliated like that?

But at 73-76 it really seems unlikely. The Nationals have a better chance of making the postseason according to the Fangraphs odds, but its still less than 2%, so, yeah...not that likely. Bryce Harper may get the MVP, but he\'s not getting that ring. Pitching Matchups: Monday: Ubaldo Jimenez vs. Gio Gonzalez Almost every start Jimenez has made this season has resulted in us crossing our fingers and hoping for the best, and I don\'t see why this will be any different. He\'s been better this season, but consistency has been a huge issue. You\'ll probably hear about how he\'s 5-1 with a 2.61 ERA in his career against the Nats, but he hasn\'t pitched against them since 2011, meaning those numbers come from before the Nationals made the playoffs for the first time. Not the same team anymore. Gio Gonzalez has slipped a little bit this year, and last year wasn\'t even that great in a very strong season from the Nationals rotation. But he\'s still going to make this his sixth straight season of double-digit wins and a 3.12 FIP is nothing to scoff at. Gonzalez has had to pitch against the Orioles a lot in these matchups - Matt Wieters has 21 PAs against him, Adam Jones has 25. Both of them have home runs against him and Wieters has a .588 average. Pretty safe bet he\'ll be the lineup.    Tuesday: Chris Tillman vs. Tanner Roark Tillman got his first win for the first time in a month his last time out against the Rays, but he still gave up three runs in only 5.2 innings. Tillman hasn\'t pitched six innings in any of his four starts this month. He\'s always done pretty well against the Nationals, but he\'s always been better than he has been this season.    Gonzalez may have slipped a little for the Nationals this season, but Roark has been a lot worse. Last year he pitched just shy of 200 innings and had a 2.85 ERA. This season he\'s 4-6 with a 4.73 ERA. He started out the season in the bullpen, getting bumped from the rotation after the Nationals got Max Scherzer. Not too much of a record against him for anyone on the Orioles, but Jonathan\'s Schoop last at-bat against him was a walk-off home run. Wednesday: TBD vs. Max Scherzer I would try to guess who the Orioles are going to put in here, but last time I tried to do that for the Rays preview, they pulled Tyler Wilson in and I was wrong. It would be Tyler Wilson\'s turn in the rotation after he pitched on Friday, but I suppose Mike Wright could get the start also.    Max Scherzer pitched against the Orioles in the final game for both teams before the All-Star break, a game in which he got the win and looked well on his way to being a Cy Young contender for the NL. Since then he\'s hardly been bad, but not nearly as dominant. In fact, in the two months since that game he\'s only gotten two wins and at one point last month got three straights losses. Good or bad though, the Nationals will still be paying him a lot of money long after he\'s done playing. Be tough on the Orioles for not spending money if you want, but if you have to make those kinds of deals to be in the free agent market, I\'ll pass thanks. Other Notes: - I commute down to Greenbelt everyday and am also a Redskins fan, so I listen to a lot of DC sports radio. The talk of the Nationals all season has absolutely been the bullpen. This probably came to a peak recently when the Nationals were swept by the Mets in three games - a series which effectively killed their season - and it was all the bullpen\'s fault. I remember watching some of those games just in awe at what was happening. But here\'s the thing - their ERA is above average for the NL, they\'ve pitched less innings than all but two other NL clubs, they have an about average BAA...so is the bullpen really a problem? My guess is a more in-depth analysis would show some incredibly bad luck for their bullpen in losing games in critical situations. - I mentioned Harper above and his quote when asked what he thought about the Nats signing Scherzer (""Where\'s my ring?""). It\'s easy to poke fun at Harper about that and a lot of other things, but you can\'t deny how good he\'s been this season. He\'s already worth more than 10 WAR this season, which is a great achievement. BUT - I think it has been slightly fueled by some luck. Here are some supporting arguments for that:    - He has a career .334 BAPIP (high!) but this year its been a ridiculous .379. - His HR/FB ratio is 20.4%. In, previous seasons it\'s never been above 12.7% - His GB/FB ratio is 0.61 - the best of his career and well below the MLB average of 0.84. So he\'s been hitting more flyballs and more of those flyballs have been going out of the park. Any balls not hit out of the park have been more likely to be put in play. Maybe this is the start of these kinds of numbers for him and in five years it\'ll look normal. I\'m betting not though. - These two teams playing kind of reminded me of the MASN case - what\'s the latest on that? Most of the latest articles I found on Google were from the spring time when the two sides made their final arguments in court. I think that means we\'re still waiting for the judge in the case to make his decision on whether to vacate the RSDC decision.    - If I remember correctly, when these two teams play you can watch the game on one MASN channel with the Orioles broadcasters and on the other with the Nationals broadcasters. This is where we are with sports broadcasting now - MASN will air two versions of the same game instead of just one and maybe not increase how much you pay for the channel each year. (And yes, I realize the Orioles hold a large stake in MASN and therefore benefit from those subscriber fees) Prediction: It\'s amazing how much different an inning can make. If Britton hadn\'t blown the save on Sunday, the O\'s would be coming into this series having won three out of four in Tampa and with the chance to get back above .500. But that doesn\'t change the fact that the O\'s have been playing a lot better lately. I think they\'ll get two out of three in DC - our time talking about their playoff being officially dead will wait a few more days.

Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 8 H, 4 R, 1 BB, 6 K.

But we know Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s routine by now\xe2\x80\xa6meaning after all these years.\xc2\xa0Anything you can do, I can do better. Forsythe\xe2\x80\x99s three-run homer in the fifth gave Tampa the lead back at 4-3. However one inning later, the Orioles tied the score back at four on a Janish RBI-single. (Janish got the start at shortstop yesterday to give Hardy a day off.)Janish would also reach base in the eighth inning on a fielding error, and with Pearce on third. This gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 5-4 lead, which in this game was fairly commanding. Parra came up later in the inning and smacked an RBI-single, and the Birds held a big lead at 6-4. Tampa would get a run back on Cabrera\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI in the last of the eighth, but the \xe2\x80\x98pen turned things over to Zach Britton with a one-run lead.And things went awry right away in the last of the ninth when Guyer hit the first pitch of the inning out of the ballpark \xe2\x80\x93 tie game, and a blown save right off the bat. After a strikeout and a triple, Britton intentionally walked Forsythe. That\xe2\x80\x99s when the Orioles started playing for something unconventional to occur \xe2\x80\x93 they brought the infield in. Conventional wisdom in that situation says to play the infield at double-play depth to try to get out of the inning. But with all of the freak things that have happened to the Orioles in games, all it would take would be a soft grounder to an infielder to beat them.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

I believe in managing to the rule asCourtesy of Andy Marlin-USA TODAY Sportsopposed to the exception. So it\xe2\x80\x99s tough for me to fathom when I see a team surrendering the double-play potential like that just to prevent something unorthodox from happening. Britton would walk the next hitter, loading the bases but also giving the Birds a force at every base \xe2\x80\x93 including home. It was only after Britton recorded the second out (by a strikeout) that Showalter moved the infield back.Again speaking for myself, that made me a bit more comfortable. That\xe2\x80\x99s a more conventional look, and a ground ball to any infielder would in theory send the game to extra innings. Britton had an 0-2 count on Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin Kiermaier \xe2\x80\x93 who mind you, can fly on the base paths. And Britton got the play he wanted; a ball in the infield. However it was a soft grounder that took some bounces on the artificial surface at Tropicana Field before settleing in Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s mitt at second. By the time he got the ball to first base, Kieraier had beaten the throw and Tampa had scored the winning run.Ironically, had the Orioles kept their infield in they might have been an out. It also might have bounced right by Schoop at second base. But again it was the least-anticipated thing that ended up beating the Orioles. And in this case they actually did anticipate just such a scenario \xe2\x80\x93 for a part of the inning.\xc2\xa0Sometimes you wonder if the baseball Gods aren\xe2\x80\x99t trying to tell the Orioles quit doing everything by the book all the time! That\xe2\x80\x99s easier said than done; as I said, manage to the rule, not the exception.

The history and quite frankly the bad blood between the two organizations is well-documented. (When I say bad blood I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking on-field; there\xe2\x80\x99s never been any issue between the teams on the field, and by all accounts several players on both sides are friendly off the field.) All the more reason why I found this piece\xc2\xa0by Ken Rosenthal of FOXsports very interesting.Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 agent, Scott Boras, is fairly tight with Washington\xe2\x80\x99s management. And we\xe2\x80\x99d thus be remiss to mention that the Orioles haven\xe2\x80\x99t been his favorite people in the world. Furthermore Washington\xe2\x80\x99s had issues at catcher for some time. Most Washington fans whom I know tell me that they like\xc2\xa0Wilson Ramos, their primary starting catcher. However he\xe2\x80\x99s had issues staying healthy for some time \xe2\x80\x93 although ironically so has Wieters,Nevertheless, the other team that Rosenthal mentions is Atlanta, which makes sense because Wieters went to Georgia Tech and he still lives in the area. I would say this; if Matt Wieters went to either Atlanta or Washington, Orioles fans probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with that (other than the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s no longer with the O\xe2\x80\x99s). That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a best-case scenario given the fact that not only would he be out of the American Leauge, but out of the AL East.Given the tension between the franchises, it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable how fans might not want him to go to Washington. Granted the O\xe2\x80\x99s would still end up facing him several times a year if he ended up there, however that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot different than what would unfold if he ended up with Boston, New York, Toronto, or Tampa. With that said, I maintain that the Orioles need to focus on re-signing both Wieters and Chris Davis \xe2\x80\x93 so as to effectively render this column null and void.As I said, one thing is certain\xe2\x80\xa6Wieters will be playing in Washington this week. In the lineup that was posted for last night, both Wieters and Jones were sitting on the bench. So it\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see if they\xe2\x80\x99re in the lineup tonight. Incidentally, the make up game for last night\xe2\x80\x99s rainout will be at 4 PM on Thursday at Nationals Park.Next: Baltimore Orioles: A look back at clinch-masMore from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Just like that pesky insect, they have come to this area from a foreign land due to a careless mistake, unwanted by anyone, and if left unchecked, they will eventually destroy everything that is green and beautiful in the Baltimore region.    The Washington Nationals are a stain on the baseball landscape. They are quite literally a stain, what with their absurd habit of unleashing a post-game chocolate syrup shower on anyone who happens to be getting interviewed on the field. It should be a crime to so frivolously waste Hershey\'s syrup. Even at this late date they persist in the chocolate dump, as if needing to use one bottle for every game out of first place in the division that they find themselves.    The Washington Nationals are the team of choice of bandwagoning transplants. There is no such thing as an adult who is a life-long Nationals fan because they have existed only for a decade. The four greatest Washington Nationals franchise players, as voted on by fans prior to the All-Star Game, are all Montreal Expos who were long gone by the time the team relocated.    The Washington Nationals have never won a playoff series in the entire time that they exist. The Washington Nationals are currently lurching towards failure in one of the most disappointing baseball campaigns of all time, given that they have wasted an all-time great season from Bryce Harper, the likely NL MVP winner. If you bet the over on their preseason win total, your ticket was a loser on September 12. They were picked as the preseason World Series favorite by nearly every so-called expert, and currently find themselves 6.5 games back in their division with just 13 games to play. The Washington Nationals have the sixth-highest payroll in all of MLB ($162,014,559 on Opening Day,\xc2\xa0per Cot\'s Contracts) and this past offseason signed Max Scherzer to a seven year, $210 million contract even as they strolled into court filings in the MASN case with their pockets turned inside out, crying poverty.    The Washington Nationals\xc2\xa0previously employed a general manager who was the subject of a federal investigation - that appears to have terminated after his resignation - over the skimming of the signing bonuses that were given during his tenure to Latin American amateur prospects. The Washington Nationals\xc2\xa0actually discouraged their fans from standing up and cheering during a postseason game. They lost the game, and the series. That people who go to Nationals games are objectively terrible fans has been\xc2\xa0well documented over the years, including\xc2\xa0earlier this month. The Washington Nationals went out of their way to acquire and employ Jonathan Papelbon. The Washington Nationals created a bobblehead of what may have been the greatest moment in Nationals history and\xc2\xa0screwed up the design so bad that they couldn\'t even give away the bobbleheads,\xc2\xa0and don\'t seem to have realized it was terrible until everyone told them it was terrible. By the way, this moment occurred in a postseason series that the Nationals ultimately lost, in the decisive fifth game, in their home stadium, when their closer Drew Storen gave up four runs in the ninth inning when the Nationals were leading 7-5 heading into that inning. By the way, Storen was displaced by the Papelbon trade and\xc2\xa0has completely stunk since being dropped to the eighth inning.    Washington Nationals manager Matt Williams was\xc2\xa0booed out of his own press conference just two weeks ago. In a series against the Mets from July 31-August 2, Williams never used Papelbon or Storen as the Mets swept the Nationals, including two games the Nationals lost due to bullpen meltdowns. After being swept in this series, the Nationals fell into a tie with the Mets, fell out of the tie the next day and have not led the division since. The Washington Nationals are not my favorite baseball team. If you don\'t know, now you know. I am an Orioles fan. (Note from the editor, who in this instance is also the author: This post was written in a satirical spirit and intended, if I might borrow from a regular reader below, as ""reasonably good natured sniping at a geographic rival fan base."" \xc2\xa0Based on feedback I have received from some among the target audience of Orioles fans, including friends of mine, I recognize that even to some in the home crowd it has come across as inflammatory rather than humorous, and while I won\'t pretend to be above trolling the O\'s neighbors, there\'s nothing worse than an unfunny troll.

However at least in this game, Showalter probably can\xe2\x80\x99t complain too much given that Ubaldo Jimenez\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single in the second inning opened the scoring and gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 1-0 lead. \xc2\xa0And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, the pitchers are in the lineup also. I see no reason why they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t swing the bat. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying to get rid of the DH.A few pitches later the O\xe2\x80\x99s expanded the lead to 2-0 on an RBI-single by\xc2\xa0Nolan Reimold. Washington got to within 2-1 in the fourth when their catcher, Lobaton, reached base on a Schoop fielding error \xe2\x80\x93 he bobbled the ball on what appeared to be a double-play ball with a runner on third. However that run was already destined to be unearned, as the runner on third reached when\xc2\xa0Junior Lake\xc2\xa0opened the inning by dropping a routine fly ball in center.To the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 credit, they closed the door after that. Washington had an opportunity to take control of the game at that moment, but the Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t about to allow that. One inning later in the fifth with Machado on first base, Washington employed a right field shift on\xc2\xa0Chris Davis. With nobody guarding third, he sent a tight grounder down the line \xe2\x80\x93 which was eventually fumbled a bit by Werth in right field. That allowed Machado to score (with a semi-dramatic play at the plate), and gave the Orioles a 3-1 lead. Davis ended up at second base, and he later scored on\xc2\xa0Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-double.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

09/24/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado in the Eye of the Storm ...', 'Sep 23, 2015; Washington, DC, USA; Baltimore Orioles third baseman Manny Machado (13) leans back to get out of the way of Washington Nationals relief pitcher Jonathan Papelbon (not pictured) pitch in the ninth inning at Nationals Park. Baltimore Orioles defeated Washington Nationals 4-3. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsMake no mistake about it. Jonathan Papelbon is the most disgusting player in baseball. And this is not a view I have come to just this now after seeing him throw at the head of Manny Machado, not once, but twice. You see, it took two pitches to hit Machado because pucker-face wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough to get it done the first time.I am far from alone in this viewpoint of the jerk. Former teammates despise him. His reputation as irksome and combative with just about everyone is well-established. He dissed his old teammates in Philly, while in Washington the new clubhouse was, well, less than celebratory to hear he was joining them at the trade deadline. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not link to the dozens upon dozens of articles that chronicle the continual oozing of crap that surrounds him. Google search it; it is all over the Net.But it seems too that Manny Machado is never far from the center of a storm. Around baseball he is becoming one of those less than well-liked players with opposing fanbases.Manny has made a few mistakes in letting his competitive spirit and emotions get the best of him\xe2\x80\x94a fellow who is still younger than 90-something percent of all players. So there is that; and here on The Baltimore Wire we have been fair in pointing that out when it has happened. Call this about 25% of why he is in the midst of the storm.

Early in the game he requested time at the plate but did not get it. He was furious with the rookie umpire (who did not have a good day at the office). Manny fumed about it, repeating that it was bull manure all of the way to the dugout, and he was still yelling several minutes later. Frankly, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather see this than the Chris Davis oft-passive response of nothing more than a quick glance, even when he is unjustly called out on a pitch six inches off the plate.So Machado was already annoyed, while at the same time another emotional player in Max Scherzer was pitching for the Nationals. He was approaching 120 pitches and attempting to get his final out of the evening by setting down Machado. Scherzer went for several walks around the mound, having just thrown 98 mph in the inning. He was hyperventilating like a bull seeing red.With a 2-2 count on Machado, Scherzer was clearly muscling up to throw one past the O\xe2\x80\x99s third baseman and get out of the seventh inning with a 3-2 lead. Obviously a four-seamer was coming, which it did at 98 mph, but catching the center of the plate. And Scherzer\xe2\x80\x99s 122nd pitch of the evening was soon out of the park in left field, and the Orioles had a 4-3 lead that would prove to be the final score.Machado did not appear to flip the bat or make a scene rounding the bases, but he was very pumped up about it, with a big gesture to the heavens when touching the plate. There was a good bit of pumped-up verbal AND body language as he returned to the dugout. Did this annoy the Nationals, particularly Papelbon? One would think so.Pucker-face did not leave the dugout after getting tossed from the game\xe2\x80\x94a violation. Flipping back and forth to both broadcasts, both were talking about how he was not supposed to be on the bench. Maybe the league office will yet have an opinion on this.Bryce Harper might want to stay a bit nimble on his feet in the series finale on Thursday afternoon.Next: Looking at how Yogi Berra performed against the Orioles ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado in the middle of it all', ""Let\xe2\x80\x99s cut right to the chase; Washington felt that Manny Machado of the Baltimore Orioles looked at his seventh inning home run for a bit too long last night. Or at least Jonathan Papelbon (who didn\xe2\x80\x99t even give up the home run) thought he did. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always said that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with a pitcher throwing at a player in that instance. However it\xe2\x80\x99s how it happened that was a problem.Chris Tillman gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a great outing last night, and due to some good timing was able to walk away with his tenth victory of the season. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 6 H, 3 R, 3 BB, 5 K. Needless to say, it was a quality start. Tillman had the lead from the beginning, as Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer gave the Birds a 2-0 lead in the top of the first. However Tillman struggled with command a bit in the last of the inning, and he gave up an RBI-single to Yunel Escobar to leave the score at 2-1\xc2\xa0Live Feed manny machadoBoston Red Sox: Chris Sale will not be suspended for throwing at Machado Call to the PenManny Machado mashes ball over Green Monster (Video) FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Kevin Gausman's Ejection Continues Bad Blood with Boston Red Sox Call to the PenChris Sale reportedly to be suspended by MLB FanSidedBoston Red Sox Attempt to Hit Manny Machado--Again Call to the PenManny Machado rips the Red Sox for throwing behind him in NSFW rant FanSidedWashington would tie things up in the last of the fifth when catcher Wilson Ramos\xe2\x80\x99 RBI-double scored Michael Taylor. Later in the innin they would the lead on Anthony Rendon\xe2\x80\x99s sac fly-RBI. At that point it appeared that it could be a matter of recording outs the rest of the way for Washington. However manager Matt Williams uncharacteristically left starter Max Scherzer in for one hitter too many in the seventh\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and it was Machado who benefited from that decision.On a 2-2 count with a runner on and two outs, Machado got a hanging slider. He jumped on it, and hit it into the \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cRed Porch\xe2\x80\x9d area of Nationals Park. That gave Tillman a chance to be the winner, reliant on what the bullpen did. And the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pen held on well, with Mychal Givens pitching two solid innings and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day getting the save in the ninth.Again, the belief was that Machado may have held his pose at home plate for a bit longer than he needed to do. So when Machado came to bat in the top of the ninth with two away, he started off with a pitch up close to Machado\xe2\x80\x99s head \xe2\x80\x93 high and tight. That seemed to give Machado pause, but the second pitch was well out of the zone but away from Machado. Then Papelbon landed his intent pitch on the third try, hitting Machado in the upper shoulder area.\xc2\xa0More from Orioles News2/20 - Baltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension2/19 - Baltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

Buck Showalter raced out of the dugout to ensure that his player didn\xe2\x80\x99t escalate the situation, and both benches cleared. In general, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the business of interpreting intent. However there was little doubt that Papelbon hit Machado intentionally. Apparently Papelbon was the only person in the park who didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so, as he and manager Matt Williams vehemently protested his ejection.Again, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to hit someone intentionally for something that happened earlier (such as admiring a home run), I do understand that. However it should never be done in the vicinty of the head \xe2\x80\x93 you bury the pitch in the guy\xe2\x80\x99s back or thigh. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Machado took exception to the pitch \xe2\x80\x93 it was the location, not the pitch itself (quote courtesy of Roch Kubatko of MASNsports):I don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily think I\xe2\x80\x99m being targeted. I\xe2\x80\x99m going up there making good swings. If people are trying to hit me, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the game. I\xe2\x80\x99m not worried about getting hit. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the hits. Its part of the game. Pitchers out there, the ball can slip out of your hand, but when you throw at the head on first pitch right from the get-go, then you throw a curveball and then you throw again at the head, that\xe2\x80\x99s just bull(crap). It\xe2\x80\x99s coward stuff. It\xe2\x80\x99s just cowardly.Again, the act of hitting someone isn\xe2\x80\x99t the part that\xe2\x80\x99s cowardly, it\xe2\x80\x99s the location. Furtherore the sanity in doing it when it was done (in the ninth inning of a one-run game that was very winnable from Washington\xe2\x80\x99s standpoint) is questionable on Papelbon\xe2\x80\x99s part also. Contrary to what some might say, throwing at someone is part of the game if you feel that player showed you up in some manner. I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that Machado showed Washington up (or that he did not); I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying that there was an impression that he waited a little too long to run. Maybe he did, maybe he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. But targeting someone\xe2\x80\x99s head is bush league \xe2\x80\x93 and is NOT part of the game.The series concludes this afternoon on what was previously a day off for both teams. Rookie Tyler Wilson will get the start for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Tanner Roark.

He said he would never change this.\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the bill of my hat to impede my vision, and for me, that\xe2\x80\x99s what bending the bill does,\xe2\x80\x9d Arrieta said on the Cubs\xe2\x80\x99 bench at Wrigley Field before a game this week. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see the brim of the hat, and I hate that.\xe2\x80\x9dArrieta became the majors\xe2\x80\x99 first 20-game winner Tuesday with a three-hit shutout of the Milwaukee Brewers. His performance in the second half has been superb: His 0.86 earned run average would be the best after the All-Star Game in major league history.As the Cubs close in on a playoff spot, Arrieta represents their best chance to make the deep October run that has eluded the franchise for generations. He has a clear vision of that, too.

You think about pitching in the playoffs; you think about pitching in the World Series. And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you should.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  This sounds like baseball heresy, a rebuke of the commandment that players shall never think beyond the next game. The ace of the Cubs, who have not won the World Series in 107 years or the National League pennant in 70, does not really care.\xe2\x80\x9cVisualization is very powerful,\xe2\x80\x9d Arrieta said, \xe2\x80\x9cand if you never put yourself in those sorts of scenarios, you\xe2\x80\x99re not exactly sure how you\xe2\x80\x99ll react.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Cubs signed Jon Lester last winter and gave him $155 million to be their No. 1 pitcher. He has mostly been very good, but Arrieta has been overpowering, a strong candidate \xe2\x80\x94 with the Los Angeles Dodgers\xe2\x80\x99 Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw \xe2\x80\x94 for the N.L. Cy Young Award. Expectations upon his arrival were much lower.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Arrieta, 29, spent parts of four seasons with the Baltimore Orioles, going 20-25 with a 5.46 E.R.A. He was promising enough to be the opening day starter in 2012 \xe2\x80\x94 even after surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow the previous summer \xe2\x80\x94 and he was so fit that Jim Palmer, the Hall of Fame pitcher, joked that Arrieta could have found work across the street making tackles for the Ravens.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cYou knew he was going to be a top-of-the-rotation guy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Palmer, an Orioles broadcaster. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there was ever any doubt about that. Barring injury, there was just no way he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles made the postseason in 2012, but Arrieta did not pitch. He struggled the next season, wound up in the minors, and was traded that July for pitcher Scott Feldman.

Credit             Charles Rex Arbogast/Associated Press           Chris Bosio, the Cubs\xe2\x80\x99 pitching coach, remembers being asked about Arrieta by General Manager Jed Hoyer and Theo Epstein, the president of baseball operations. Bosio, a former scout, said he saw the same qualities in Arrieta that he had seen in Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Jordan Zimmermann in college: a right-hander with four pitches who competed like an animal. The Cubs just had to bring it out of him.\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we tried to do with him when we got him, from every angle \xe2\x80\x94 physically, mentally, fundamentally \xe2\x80\x94 was to let him be himself,\xe2\x80\x9d Epstein said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing I said to him when we got him: \xe2\x80\x98Hey, man, we think you\xe2\x80\x99re really good. We want you to go back to doing what you think you do best.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  For Arrieta, that meant throwing across his body. This is generally discouraged by teams, for fear of shoulder trouble and the difficulty it can cause in locating pitches on the pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s glove side. When it works, though, the deception can baffle hitters.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Madison Bumgarner, the sublime left-hander of the San Francisco Giants, has a crossfire delivery. Coaches tried to change it in the minor leagues, and after a brief and awful experience, Bumgarner reverted to his natural motion. The Giants have won three championships since.The Cubs moved Arrieta closer to the third base side of the rubber and encouraged his preferred delivery, in which he steps far to his right before firing. His fastball seems to have more run from this angle, but his raw stuff was already so impressive that Cubs reliever Tommy Hunter, a former Baltimore teammate, called Arrieta the most talented pitcher he had ever seen.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cJake\xe2\x80\x99s got the stuff, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got the mind-set,\xe2\x80\x9d Hunter said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe really thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s as good as he is. To have the confidence and the ability at the same time is something that not a lot of people have \xe2\x80\x94 or ever find.\xe2\x80\x9dFor a while, though, Arrieta was just another pitcher with a dazzling repertory who had never made his mark. Trying to throw on a straight line to the plate, as an Oriole, he simply could not command his fastball. The biting curveball, the divebombing slider that he can manipulate into a cutter \xe2\x80\x94 none of it mattered.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cI was always in hitter\xe2\x80\x99s counts,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo all those other pitches weren\xe2\x80\x99t successful because of so many other factors. In trying to take away my crossfire, it changed the way I pitched, and it made me struggle for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9dLast season, after missing a month with shoulder soreness, Arrieta was 10-5 with a 2.53 E.R.A. He took no-hitters into the seventh inning three times and averaged better than a strikeout per inning.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  This year has been even better, with 220 strikeouts in 216 innings, a no-hitter at Dodger Stadium on Aug. 30 and a franchise-record 18 consecutive quality starts. Spotting his fastball? You could say he has mastered it.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Joe Maddon, the Cubs\xe2\x80\x99 manager, called that Arrieta\xe2\x80\x99s most impressive trait. It was the same for his pitchers at Tampa Bay, Maddon said, when David Price, Alex Cobb and Chris Archer could not use their curveballs, changeups and sliders until they mastered their fastballs.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s all this outstanding other stuff that they throw, but it would not be chased or taken unless the hitter knows this guy can throw a fastball for a strike,\xe2\x80\x9d Maddon said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt starts there.\xe2\x80\x9d Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

He was the first pitcher to finish a no-hitter by striking out the side in order since Sandy Koufax threw a perfect game in 1965, also at Dodger Stadium, and each of Arrieta\xe2\x80\x99s put-away pitches was different.

For lovers of pitching, it was riveting theater.\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you see on TV, it looks nasty, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not as nasty as when you stand in the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box and try to hit it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miguel Montero, the catcher that night. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people can watch on TV and go, \xe2\x80\x98Why do they swing at that?\xe2\x80\x99 Yeah, it looks good when it comes at you, but then it just disappears.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Arrieta said his bullpen session before the no-hitter was one of his worst, and said he did not feel sharp Tuesday against the Brewers, either. The results told a different story, but that was no accident. When he pitched at Texas Christian, Arrieta wrote \xe2\x80\x9cA.C.E.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Acting Cures Everything \xe2\x80\x94 under the bill of his cap. If his stuff is not good, he pretends it is.

Montero compared Arrieta\xe2\x80\x99s demeanor to those of Roger Clemens and Gerrit Cole, the Pittsburgh right-hander who could oppose Arrieta in the N.L. wild-card game Oct. 7.

He drinks kale juice and is a Pilates devotee \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI tried that and felt so uncoordinated,\xe2\x80\x9d Maddon said \xe2\x80\x94 and his fitness pays off in his fielding. Arrieta leads N.L. pitchers in assists and putouts.

Arrieta has a long way to go to reach that status, but it is worth noting that Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s breakout season also came at 29.

Arrieta did not come to Chicago as a star, but he plans to stay one.

Only three years ago, Machado was discussed in the Mike Trout/Bryce Harper sphere of best young players baseball had to offer, but consecutive season-ending knee surgeries sort of, kind of drifted Machado into a forgotten purgatory. To no fault of his own, Machado was somewhat disrespected heading into 2015, despite a career .278/.313/.434 slash with 33 HRs and 128 RBIs in three seasons prior to turning only 23 years-old.    Despite the Orioles\' averageness as a unit, Machado has re-established himself right back into the conversation of baseball\'s elite talents. In 151 games, the young Hakuna Machado has hit an astounding .289/.360/.493 with 30 HRs and 77 RBIs, almost exclusively as the O\'s leadoff hitter. As well as showing the growing power the Orioles previous front office had predicted, Machado continues to make the difficult plays at the hot corner look routine, and the impossible plays appear to be nothing more than a momentary annoyance. Machado, a rising star with the bat and glove is an easy capture for those of Baltimore. However, it seems that his previous bouts with immaturity have made the baseball world just slightly hesitant to accept him with open arms. I\'ll admit, I defended Manny during and after the Josh Donaldson incident, almost entirely for the sole fact that I was very anti-Oakland a season ago. I also, for only the slightest of moments, took Manny\'s side after he attempted to throw a bat at Fernando Abad the very next day. I\'m not proud of it, and I\'m sure Mr. Machado is the first one to look back on the whole thing and wonder what the hell he was thinking.    As much as you wish those kind of moments wouldn\'t appear in the career scope of Machado once he\'s retired and gone, they won\'t. There is still the chance of blow-ups somewhere down the line, as we\'ve seen a few times this season, but in Machado\'s case, it isn\'t necessarily a detriment. This is more or less what baseball is becoming.    I\'m not referring to the outrageous showcases of fury, but that subtle (OK, not so subtle) swagger that is becoming more and more associated with baseball\'s youngsters. Buck Showalter has created one of baseball\'s most successful and cohesive clubhouses, one of the many causes for the Orioles\' winning surge that began in 2012. However, often times there seems to be a lack of overall raw emotion. That good-time chip-on-your-shoulder. You know, that encompassing outpouring that comes with playing baseball.    You see it almost every day with Manny. Sometimes it comes on a backhand stab at third base, when he does that kind of ""I\'m better than you and I know it"" look at the baseball just before firing a 100 MPH fastball over to Chris Davis. As has happened on thirty occasions this season, that long hold of the bat behind his head as he watches yet another glorious raindrop fall into the stands. My favorite, however, comes as he rounds the bases, hits home plate, and does that little wave to the third base side, just behind the dugout.           <picture class=""c-picture"" data-cid=""site/picture_element-1494652742_8708_12064"" data-cdata=\'{""picture"":true,""dynamic_picture"":false,""convert_picture"":false}\'>            <img srcset=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f-nH9rea7xBtjH1hI-sON8d4Pf8=/0x0:718x404/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4092268/Z8dR1Wa.0.gif 320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BS2pCY1WEwWrAOde9NpyFoA5kEc=/0x0:718x404/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4092268/Z8dR1Wa.0.gif 520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B3gCSODA4SP7_iGnhA-hVVlVNK4=/0x0:718x404/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4092268/Z8dR1Wa.0.gif 720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QvXipDVbpaK_0o7PDwsxQLgWZm0=/0x0:718x404/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4092268/Z8dR1Wa.0.gif 920w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8-OzbIzdQbcRpoz_kgtlH6TvG1I=/0x0:718x404/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4092268/Z8dR1Wa.0.gif 1120w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nd-PFDzEeSpbv4cE0TCguKP0wOw=/0x0:718x404/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4092268/Z8dR1Wa.0.gif 1320w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fp0JVF6f6EIwVdRxutXbJoLRcMs=/0x0:718x404/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4092268/Z8dR1Wa.0.gif 1520w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6qQfDLwh32Q2FpMFy9eVud7h5c=/0x0:718x404/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4092268/Z8dR1Wa.0.gif 1720w, https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mD58DfF8exGbs-X3zNJEtAdchzI=/0x0:718x404/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4092268/Z8dR1Wa.0.gif 1920w"" sizes=""(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qr3zkP0fYxiQByn71qnKTOCnVkw=/0x0:718x404/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:718x404):no_upscale()/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4092268/Z8dR1Wa.0.gif"">  </picture>          I love Jonathan Schoop. I have one Orioles shirsey, and of the seven days of the week, my Schoop No. 6 t-shirt makes an appearance no less than three times a week (it also makes me look slimmer than I am, so it\'s a natural choice). My man crush for Johnny is based more so on his growing unique skills at a position he doesn\'t necessarily fit, but plays excellently anyway. Johnny is a bit more laid back however, with a personality that doesn\'t really come at you. He seems like the nicest human being there ever was, but there isn\'t quite an edge to his game (not that there\'s a problem with it). Other than his recent bat slam (a moment I\'ll never forget), I have a hard time remembering an instance when Chris Davis kind of overwhelmed us with his persona. Though Davis is more of a behind-the-scenes guy that seems to be the ultimate teammate and all-around funny guy, his emotions don\'t leak onto the field.    Adam Jones is a smooth swag criminal that has a reputation as being what he is. Along with Machado, Jonesy probably falls second in the mojo rankings, but again, there just isn\'t the consistent display of the new baseball style when compared to Machado. Don\'t get me wrong though. It\'s definitely there. Matt Wieters seems dull, Steve Pearce is Steve Pearce and of the pitchers, they tend to be more stable than lively. Machado is as unique a person as he is a baseball player, and it\'s facet of his game that can continue to help him succeed. Last night, after being thrown at the head not once, but twice, Jonathan Papelbon essentially gift-wrapped an invitation to the mound for a good ole fashion baseball throw down. Machado did not oblige, but he did let Papelbon know how he felt about the at-bat, and as much as we (maybe just I) would have liked to see Papelbon eat his just desserts, Machado showed restraint. Pitchers don\'t want to plunk has-beens or just another dude. More often than not, it\'s those that make their mark that are the targets of baseball justice. Machado did nothing wrong by punishing Max Scherzer\'s 2-2 mistake. The Orioles are still somewhat alive in a tight playoff race, and guess what? The O\'s and Nationals don\'t seem to be too fond of each other. It\'s big to hit a home run off of Scherzer, the $210M man, but the moment is heightened when you hit a no-doubt-about-it bomb at 114 MPH to give your team a one-run lead. Showalter picks his shots when to express himself, and in due time, I\'d bet Manny learns the same. But he should never, ever apologize for blending the man he is with the baseball player he is evolving into.    I\'m only 23, so maybe I\'m in the minority when I ask for the swag police to take the night off, but Manny is a figure much different than what Orioles fans have become accustomed to. So don\'t expect his beacon of vibes to slowly dissolve any time soon.

The series marked the first time this season the front-runner for the NL MVP award has been hitless in three consecutive games.""It\'s disappointing,"" Nationals manager Matt Williams said, ""that we didn\'t win these games.""Washington entered the day 6 1/2 games behind the NL East-leading New York Mets.""It\'s not great,"" Williams conceded. ""Not where we want to be.""Asked to characterize the Nationals\' mood after their bullpen blew yet another lead, Ian Desmond said: ""Frustrated. But as long as we have a chance, there\'s still hope.""There were no beanballs and no brawl, a day after Washington closer Jonathan Papelbon hit Manny Machado with a pitch in the ninth, two innings after Machado hit a go-ahead two-run homer off Max Scherzer to give Baltimore a 4-3 victory.That led Harper to surmise: ""I\'ll probably get drilled tomorrow.""Even as much of the pregame chatter Thursday centered on that possibility, both managers tried to downplay such speculation.""Retaliation? You\'re not supposed to do that,"" Baltimore\'s Buck Showalter said. ""The best retaliation would be to win another game, right? That\'s usually how it works.""And so that\'s what his club did, thanks in large part to Matt Wieters\' two-run homer off Blake Treinen (2-4) in the eighth inning.""Winning three games,"" Showalter said afterward, \'is the best \'back at ya.\'""Both clubs hold the slimmest of playoff hopes: Baltimore entered Thursday four games out of the second AL wild-card spot.But the Orioles have won 11 of their past 15 games to at least keep themselves within shouting distance.The Nationals have won only seven of their last 16 games.Baltimore went ahead 3-0 on Machado\'s RBI single in the first and Jonathan Schoop\'s two-run shot in the fourth. But Wilson Ramos\' homer and Yunel Escobar\'s pair of run-scoring hits helped the Nationals go up 4-3 entering the eighth.Steve Pearce greeted Blake Treinen (2-4) with a single, and Wieters followed with his seventh homer, putting the Orioles out front for good.""I haven\'t hit one good for a few weeks,"" Wieters said.Treinen blamed poor location for a pitch that stayed up.""Nobody wants to fail, especially with the implications that we\'re still in the race,"" Treinen said.Mike Wright (3-5) got two outs in the seventh for the victory. Brad Brach threw a scoreless eighth, and Darren O\'Day pitched the ninth for his sixth save of the season and third of the series. Harper\'s groundout to Machado ended it.Another chance for Harper came in the fifth, when Washington scored twice and had a man on first with one out as Harper came up to face rookie starter Tyler Wilson. A comebacker set up an inning-ending 1-6-3 double play.Washington could have scored more in the seventh, but Anthony Rendon was thrown out at home by second baseman Schoop on a relay from center fielder Gerardo Parra. And in the eighth, Clint Robinson led off with a double but was thrown out at third by Wieters on Desmond\'s attempted sacrifice bunt.""Every loss, for me, feels the same,"" Desmond said.TRAINER\'S ROOMOrioles: CF Adam Jones (back spasms) was out of the starting lineup for the third consecutive game and had an MRI in Baltimore that showed no structural damage.Nationals: INF Danny Espinosa is ""likely done for the season"" because of a torn right hamstring, Williams said.UP NEXTOrioles: RHP Kevin Gusman (3-6, 4.26 ERA) will start Friday\'s opener of a series at the Boston Red Sox, who will send LHP Rich Hill (1-0, 1.93) to the mound.Nationals: Opening a three-game series against visiting Philadelphia, Washington will start RHP Jordan Zimmermann (13-8, 3.49) against rookie RHP Jerad Eickhoff (1-3, 3.16).CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

09/25/2015,"[('Bob Haynie: Orioles Back To .500 \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' On September 7, the Baltimore Orioles suffered a disappointing 8-6 defeat at the hands of the New York Yankees. That Labor Day setback at Yankee Stadium dropped the Birds to 65-72 and was their 15th loss in 18 games. For all intents and purposes, Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of getting to the playoffs for the third time in four years were dashed. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a good run. See you in spring training.  At least that\xe2\x80\x99s what some of us thought.  Since that game, the Orioles have been playing some good baseball and they have been winning. A lot. Just ask the Washington Nationals who were the victims of a three-game Baltimore sweep.  The Birds have been victorious in 11 of their last 15 contests and are back to a .500 record. Heading into this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s three-game series against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway, the Orioles are sporting a 76-76 mark and have moved to within 3.5 games of the second American League Wild Card spot.  Only 10 regular season games remain and the chances of the Orioles getting to the playoffs are still slim. But their recent run of success has given them at least a glimmer of hope. After the Red Sox, the Birds return to Camden Yards for four games with the AL East-leading Toronto Blue Jays and then will face the probably playoff-bound Yankees for three more. Two teams are ahead of the Orioles (Twins and Angels) in their quest to catch the fading Houston Astros for the second wild-card berth.  The Twins, who swept seven games from the Orioles this season, have three games at Detroit, four at Cleveland and will finish their schedule with three at home against K.C. The Twins, like the Angles, are 1.5 games behind Houston.  The Angels will host Seattle for three games and then follow that with three more at home against Oakland. They close out their regular season with four games on the road against the AL West-leading Texas Rangers.  Houston will host the Rangers for three games and then hit the road for three each against Seattle and Arizona.  Obviously, the Orioles are going to need some help if they want to play bonus baseball in 2015. Of course, they also need to keep winning.  To their credit, they have made scoreboard watching relevant again in the closing stages of this interesting Major League Baseball season.  var addthis_product = \'wpp-261\'; var addthis_config = {""data_track_clickback"":true};if (typeof(addthis_share) == ""undefined""){ addthis_share = {""url_transforms"":{""shorten"":{""twitter"":""bitly""}},""shorteners"":{""bitly"":{""login"":""cbslocal"",""apiKey"":""R_bfe2742f79bb4091b0fcfbdf5c6a81ca""}}};}  ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), (""Orioles' playoff hopes fading; fall to Red Sox - USA TODAY"", 'Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Kevin Gausman delivers during the first inning of a baseball game against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park in Boston, Friday, Sept. 25, 2015.

The biggest mistake he said he made was challenging David Ortiz during a three-run sixth.""I probably let my ego get the best of me,"" Gausman said. ""Tried to throw a fastball by him like I did the pitch before.""Leading 2-0 in the sixth, Boston scored two runs when both players slid into the plate a second or so apart on Ortiz\'s double that chased Gausman.Dustin Pedroia drew a leadoff walk and Bogaerts singled. Ortiz then hit a deep shot to right, just out of the reach of Alvarez.Pedroia, who held up to see if the ball was caught so he could tag, beat the relay throw by going in headfirst before Bogaerts slid in ahead of Joseph\'s tag. Brock Holt\'s RBI double made it 5-0.The 35-year-old Hill (2-0) was released by Washington in June, then played for the Long Island Ducks in an independent league before signing a minor league deal with the Red Sox in August.Hill threw his second career shutout \xe2\x80\x94 the other came in 2006 with the Chicago Cubs. The game ended when right fielder Mookie Betts made a leaping catch at the wall, robbing Chris Davis of a homer.Hill gave up a hit to the first batter he faced before holding Baltimore hitless until Dariel Alvarez opened the ninth with an infield single.Earlier this month, Hill became the first Red Sox pitcher to fan 10 or more in his initial two starts.Ortiz had three doubles and three RBIs as Boston stopped a three-game losing streak.

Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 franchise has turned around in many ways over the last five years, and there are numerous people who are partly responsible for that.Andy MacPhail deserves credit for trading Erik Bedard for team cornerstones Adam Jones and Chris Tillman, and also trading for J.J. Hardy.There is the development of Manny Machado.But most people point to Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter joining the Baltimore Orioles as a big part of their turnaround.Now, as the Orioles attempt to earn their way into the 2015 postseason, the drama is swirling around the team.This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a new occurrence. It all started with Dan Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s dalliance with the Toronto Blue Jays during the offseason. Peter Angelos would not let Duquette go to Toronto for the higher-paying, higher-profile position, and so Duquette stayed in Baltimore.Many called Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s offseason \xe2\x80\x98uninspiring.\xe2\x80\x99 Key acquisitions for the 2015 season included Travis Snider, Wesley Wright, and Everth Cabrera. How many of those are still on the team? Zero.You could tell in some of Buck\xe2\x80\x99s comments that losing Nick Markakis and Nelson Cruz was not exactly popular, among the players or the coaches.Recently, the columns about growing tension between Buck and Dan continue to grow. It started with articles by Nick Cafardo of the Boston Globe and Jerry Crasnick of ESPN.Now, the latest from Ken Rosenthal of FOXSports, only adds to the growing popular sentiment that all is not well.It is important to emphasize that none of this is really new information. There may be new \xe2\x80\x98sources\xe2\x80\x99 among the FO expressing dissent, but the overall issues are not new. But, a lot of the national media is running with it, with the O\xe2\x80\x99s currently on the outside looking in. In fact, O\xe2\x80\x99s beat reporter Roch Kubatko commented on one of his blogs that much of this is old news and there is very little new content.But, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at some of the issues reported in the article.Rosenthal writes that Peter Angelos wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let Duquette leave, discontent started to grow. Reasons for the frustration reportedly include the lack of replacements for Markakis and Cruz. The lack of impact from the numerous offseason signings made by Duquette.Also cited is the continued failings of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 farm system, which despite successful seasons among many teams, continues to not produce major league players.Rick Peterson and the opinion of the O\xe2\x80\x99s minor league pitching development director also appears to be an issue, as well as the fact that most of the minor league coaches do not have a contract entering the offseason.None of these items shock me, nor should they most fans. If Nick Markakis and Nelson Cruz were still on this team, the O\xe2\x80\x99s would almost certainly be division leaders. The players signed to be starters this year didn\xe2\x80\x99t look great on paper, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t play as well as touted by Duquette. Now, none are with the team.The minor leagues continues to not provide the Orioles with players successful enough to become major league contributors. Sure, there are players like Jonathan Schoop and Manny, but they are the exception.And the fact that the Orioles haven\xe2\x80\x99t developed a starting pitcher who has been a quality major league starter since Mike Mussina has not been rectified since Duquette came to town. Well, some have developed, but were traded away (Zach Davies and Eduardo Rodriguez.)Rosenthal says that Buck doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the GM, but he would like more say in decisions. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with that.\xc2\xa0 I think the manager should have some input, as he is the one who knows his team best. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure Duquette agrees.

They realize the role Buck Showalter plays as a manager, and how much he means to the City of Baltimore.If there is dissent, and a change has to be made, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see Showalter going anywhere.And after a year that saw a team underwhelm, maybe a change does need to made.The Orioles still have a fighting chance to make the playoffs, and are playing their best baseball right now.The offseason was always going to be absolutely crucial to the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 future. With all of these rumors, the Orioles will need to do more than just sign free agents.\xc2\xa0 They also are likely going to have to find a way to deal with the issues in management too.Hang on folks, if you think it is interesting in Baltimore now, this might just be the start.Next: Looking back at Yogi Berra's play against the Orioles "", 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"

09/28/2015,"[('Conspiracy theory time: Brady Anderson will be the next GM ...', "" The Orioles were summarily swept out of Boston this weekend finally choking out the last dying gasps of their playoff chances. Of course, after getting shut out for three straight games, the world watched Jake Arrieta dominate on the mound and hit a home run for good measure. It was a nice little 24-hour encapsulation of everything that has gone wrong for the Orioles in 2015.    As so happens, when expectations are not met, people become upset. And when people get upset they talk to reporters. No fewer than three different national baseball writers have reported on strife in the Orioles front office.\xc2\xa0Nick Cafardo of the Boston Globe,\xc2\xa0Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports, and\xc2\xa0Jerry Crasnick of ESPN have all in the past month essentially reported the same thing. Dan Duquette's dalliances with the Toronto Blue Jays in the off season and owner Peter Angelos' unwillingness to let Duquette go have made for a discordant front office. The tropes have been consistent throughout. As the team has failed Duquette has been called into question on his loyalty to the team, his inability to replace on the field and clubhouse leaders, and parts of the organization that have failed. Most notably, minor league pitching coordinator Rick Peterson--who, between Duquette and himself have some atypical theories on pitching--and his level of control over a pitching development program that has not developed a pitcher. Into this environment steps Brady Anderson. I want to be clear. I have no sources and \xc2\xa0little evidence. This is probably best described as a conspiracy theory more than anything else. Yet, I still believe that Brady Anderson will be the next General Manager (or whatever stupid title baseball teams can come up with these days) of the Baltimore Orioles.    The Who Brady Anderson is the current Vice President for Baseball Operations while Dan Duquette is the Executive Vice President for Baseball Operations. The title inflation in baseball is truly amazing. \xc2\xa0Regardless, think of Duquette as the GM and Anderson as the Assistant GM. Anderson is most famous for his playing as an Oriole, ranked as the 11th best Orioles player of all time by Camden Chat back in 2014. He joined the Orioles front office in 2012 as a special assistant to Dan Duquette.    He started off mostly doing what most special assistants do: whatever they are best at. For Brady Anderson, that thing was player fitness. He held off season workouts and helped some players rehab. However, his record and title have only grown. By 2013, a year later, Anderson was promoted to the Assistant GM. In\xc2\xa0the Orioles front office chart he is right below Dan Duquette. The second in command. The Why So why Brady Anderson? Well, he has been with the organization for a long time. It appears that owner Peter Angelos is fond of him due to his recent promotions. Furthermore, if continuity was the goal, if for some reason Duquette moved on, then hiring someone who has learned right under him for the past four seasons would be a good start.    Anderson has already shown some more attributes of being an actual AGM and not merely a special assistant.\xc2\xa0He helped hire the hitting coach,\xc2\xa0he has spoken about his player evaluation philosophies, and has even gone on the record about his willingness and ability to run a baseball team.\xc2\xa0He has conferred with Buck Showalter and Duquette about roster decisions and has hired some of the minor league personnel. Anderson is seemingly being groomed for the position one day. The How This is a question that I have yet to resolve. It appears to me that Dan Duquette probably will not be fired anytime soon nor would he resign a position in baseball that was given to him after ten long years in exile. I suppose the situation could become toxic enough that he would have to leave, but it seems unlikely. My best guess is that we will see some front office reshuffling. Perhaps Duquette slides up one notch on the ladder to Executive Vice President and John Angelos takes his father's place atop of the organization. This lets Anderson slide into the head of Baseball Operations. This gives others in the organization a chance for a promotion and gives Anderson some more control so he can bring in his own people. While Peter Angelos stepping aside seems like the least likely scenario in this whole conspiracy theory, it could theoretically happen.    The When When this will all happen is probably the toughest to figure out. I would think that if much of the reported strife is true, this off season will be a reckoning for some in the organization. I would expect some firings, some resignations, and some reassignments. The disastrous 2015 off season and regular season is likely to claim some victims. This coming off season is probably not the most likely of times to promote Anderson, but I bet we start to here about his role in the organization growing and how he has stepped up to take on a bigger role. This has already happened some and as his comfort level in the position grows, so will his duties. It may not be this off season, but by the end of Duquette's contract--which after his extension, ends in 2018-- my best guess is that Brady Anderson will be the GM. *** This is all simply a theory and probably a poorly thought out one at that. Most likely, some minor firings and reassignments occur and the organization moves on. The losing of this season after a dumpster fire of a off season is bound to provide some strife and turmoil, even in the best of front offices. The Orioles organization most definitely has it's issues, and hopefully they can be addressed, but Dan Duquette after bringing the team from irrelevance to competitiveness has earned a bit more leash. Regardless of how big or how soon, changes are coming and my conspiracy theory leads me to Brady Anderson.

09/29/2015,"[('Should Ryan Flaherty be on the Orioles in 2016 ...', "" The Orioles utiltyman Ryan Flaherty has been bad in 2015. I mean, overall he just hasn't been a very good player in the majors ever, but it is possible that this season, in which he turned 29 years old, an age where baseball players tend to be hitting the peak of their careers, Flash has sunk to what could be his lowest point yet. It begs the question, should the Orioles even put him on the 25-man roster in 2016?    Given the fact that he has been the only Orioles offense in the past four days, I realize this may seem a bit harsh. But try to see the big picture behind this proposal, people. Maybe we are getting a little ahead of ourselves. Spring Training is still four-and-a-half months away. There is an entire off-season to happen where the Orioles are going to be signing players (HA!) and losing players (*sniffles*). A lot of stuff can happen. But manager Buck Showalter sure seems like he is looking for Flaherty to give him a reason to stay in Baltimore beyond this year. To the outfield The second base job, which was never really Flaherty's but we kind of thought it was for a minute a few years ago, is firmly in the grasp of Jonathan Schoop at this point.    Shortstop? Yeah, J.J. Hardy has that locked down until Manny Machado is ready to take over.    And let's be honest, the Vanderbilt alum is never going to hit enough to be a corner infielder on the regular. The pop comes and goes. So, Showalter has reverted to sending good, old Ryan to the outfield. Left field. Right field. It doesn't really matter. Just somewhere out there. No one else is really doing anything to claim it for themselves. Give it a go, Ry-Ry.    The sample sizes are too small to really judge, but over 165.1 innings in the outfield for his career, Flaherty has an Ultimate Zone Rating of -2.9. No, that is not absolutely awful, but given the fact that his career batting line is .219/.286/.368, it leaves a lot to be desired. However, it looks like Flaherty hits a tad better when he plays the outfield. Going into last night's games, Flash slashed .261/.292/.391 as a left fielder and .235/.297/.324 as a right fielder. His best hitting position overall is shortstop where he has a line of .262/.314/.468 with five home runs over 46 career games. Really struggling But no matter where you look this season, Flaherty is worth nothing, or close to nothing. Fangraphs gives him a WAR of 0.1 and Baseball Reference gives him a WAR of 0.0. BR breaks theirs down a bit farther with an offensive WAR of 0.3 and a defensive WAR of -0.1    Yes, even his defense, excluding the outfield business, has been sub-par. His UZR at first base is -0.7. At second base it is -1.2. At third (where he has spent the least time on the infield) it is an above average 1.1. And at short he has a -0.8 UZR. That is supposed to be his calling card and the reason why the O's keep him around. That hasn't been the case in 2015. Nothing to lose Now, Flaherty is still a cheap guy to keep around the team. He is making $1.075 million this year. He is arbitration eligible again this winter and will likely see a bit of a raise, but is still going to be more affordable than most other veterans his age. Coming into this season, Mr. Versatile still had an option remaining. While he was sent down to Triple-A Norfolk at one point, I don't believe he was down long enough to have actually burned the option and he has yet to play five full years in the Bigs so that should still be on the table. Who else? Is there an heir apparent to Flaherty's throne as reigning utilityman? Not really. The organization has brought in countless guys to try but none of them have survived or have some fault that Flaherty inevitable can improve upon. Ah, if Jimmy Paredes could just catch a baseball every once in a while. Apart from Ben Zobrist, who in my opinion would be the perfect signing for the Orioles, there isn't much on the free agent market that would be a marked improvement on what they have. Some of the names: Sean Rodriguez, Mike Aviles, Juan Uribe, Gordon Beckham. Ugh.    That is not to say the Showalter and Dan Duquette should not and will not try. There will always be veterans willing to take minor league deals for another shot. That is practically Duquette's lifeblood. Where we stand I really wanted to use this article to talk myself into the idea that Flaherty has to go, but the more I looked into it, the more I realize he is probably going to stay right where he is. Think about it. He is cheap and relatively young for a guy that seems like he has been around forever. While not always effective, he can play six positions on the field with some sort of confidence. There is power in his swing. And last, but not least, Showalter loves the guy. Anytime he does much of anything, the manager gushes about him in the post-game press conference. That right there could be enough to keep him an Oriole until he retires. But seriously, Flaherty will be an Oriole at some point in 2016. He may spend more time in Norfolk than this past season, but at some point we are going to see the dude grounding out to second base at Camden Yards. Oh, it is enough to get me excited for Opening Day already. Thanks for reading! What should the Orioles do with their utility spot on the bench? Stick with Flaherty or go in a different direction?

The final blow came as a result of Monday\'s defeat at the hands of the Blue Jays and an Astros victory over the Mariners in Seattle.    For over a month now it\'s felt like only a matter of time, though the team managed to keep rallying to win enough games to keep dim hopes alive, at least until this past weekend when they were shut out for an entire weekend by the Red Sox. Not that it will make you feel any better, but even if the Orioles had somehow managed to win the last four games that they instead lost, they\'d still be facing a deficit of 2.5 games with six to play, and three teams still to pass. That was never a very likely caper for them to pull off. It would have been nicer if they had held on for longer, not so much for the sake of this season as to give us, the fans, a bit more hope going into next year. Perhaps we could have at least had the likely returning members of the starting rotation look solid over the last month or so, for instance. That just hasn\'t happened. Instead, it\'s finally time to say, ""Maybe next year."" That it took so long to get to that point is a reminder that this kind of season is a lot better than the kind with which we were acquainted from 1998-2011. Even if the 2015 Orioles don\'t win another game - a miserable outcome - they would still be better than all but one of the losing Orioles teams of the 2000s. We experienced a lot of completely bad teams in that time. We did not have so many run-of-the-mill bad teams. They are not astoundingly bad. They just weren\'t good enough.    It\'s tough to turn an eye to next year at this point in time, mostly because who even knows who will be on the team next year? This O\'s team is unique among those in recent memory for having so many departing free agents who are good players, who have been on good Orioles teams, who we would like to see them keep. Nobody much missed Luke Scott or Cesar Izturis. Chris Davis, Wei-Yin Chen, and Darren O\'Day will surely be missed. So will Matt Wieters, not so much for expected future performance as for what he once represented.    Problems the Orioles face heading into next season There\'s no considering next year without thinking about the many giant question marks that will face the team. With the way the starting rotation has pitched this year, who will stick around from that unit? Will they bring in someone via free agency to take one of the open spots? If the 2016 Orioles rotation does not significantly improve on the 2015 version\'s results, the team will likely not be going anywhere good regardless of what else happens. Even if the rotation gets better, they\'ll also be facing the likely uncertainty of losing their biggest power bat in Chris Davis. Will the Orioles back up enough armored cars full of $100 bills onto Davis\' lawn to keep him? If they do so, will that prove to be a good decision? If not, who the heck is going to play first base? The prospect of the Orioles picking who has the best spring between Christian Walker and Trey Mancini and having that be the Davis replacement is not an encouraging one.    Health will be a question too. Miguel Gonzalez has battled through problems that hurt his performance in 2015. So, it seems, have J.J. Hardy and Adam Jones. If Hardy doesn\'t bounce back, what will the O\'s do? If Gonzalez doesn\'t, they\'ll be stuck with a struggling, multi-million dollar starting pitcher much like they were with Bud Norris this year. All of this is assuming that everyone who was actually good and healthy this year will be good and healthy next year. As we learned this season, that\'s simply not always the case. The O\'s will need Manny Machado and Jonathan Schoop to stay healthy. They\'ll need Zach Britton and whoever joins him in the back end of the bullpen to remain healthy and effective all year. There are many questions and uncertainties that the team will face for next season. They won\'t be able to do much to start solving any of those issues until after the World Series, but hopefully over the next month they can start working out some answers that will keep the team in the postseason chase all the way to the end - or at least get them back above .500.

09/30/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles Chris Tillman: Lacking a Put-Away Pitch', ""Sep 6, 2015; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Baltimore Orioles catcher Steve Clevenger (45) talks with Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Chris Tillman (30) during the third inning in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre. Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsWhile watching a Baltimore Orioles game recently in which Chris Tillman was the starting pitcher, as batter after batter fouled off two-strike pitches, the MASN announcer said \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cFor a pitcher who has now made over 145 career starts, and given the variety of pitches he throws, Tillman still has not really developed a put-away pitch to get a greater number of strikeouts.\xe2\x80\x9d This is a very good overall observation about Tillman. He has been slowly improving each year by cutting down on endless at-bats and elevated pitch counts, though his performance has taken a step back this current year.Tillman is at his best when he pounds the corners of the strike zones, as was done on Monday against the Jays in his very good start \xe2\x80\x94 giving up two runs in 7.1 innings. He threw 69 out of 104 pitches for strikes. And though he only had three strikeouts, the high percentage of strikes forced the hitters to swing and put balls into play. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s movement on pitches was better than average, and he was therefore more pitch efficient.Honestly, Tillman does not have the pitch movement possessed by most of the other Orioles pitchers. But is it imagination that he does not have a put-away pitch, or do statistics support this general observation?Let me give you two categories of stats, comparing the other Orioles starters: Ubaldo Jimenez, Wei-Yin Chen, Kevin Gausman and Miguel Gonzalez, along with Zach Britton thrown into the mix.General Stats \xe2\x80\x93 Earned Run Average / Batting Average Against / Strikeouts per 9 innings / Walks per 9 innings / Pitches Per Plate Appearance \xe2\x80\xa6PitcherERABAAK9BB9PPATillman5.05.2656.23.23.98Jimenez4.10.2578.13.33.86Chen3.35.2647.31.83.79Gausman4.49.2558.02.74.04Gonzalez4.85.2706.83.13.91Britton2.01.21711.12.03.57\xc2\xa0First, it is striking to see Tillman \xe2\x80\x94 the presumptive staff ace \xe2\x80\x94 with the highest ERA of this group. Of course much of this came from his Canadian-based nemeses known as the Blue Jays. But notice also that he does possess the least number of strikeouts per nine innings, even fewer than Miguel Gonzalez. It is also interesting to see that he has walked batters at a ratio rather close to Jimenez. That is never a resume enhancement.But the striking number in this graph is the final column of pitches per plate appearance. Only Gausman averages more. The difference may seem rather miniscule, but consider the number of batters a starter sees in a game. Say that a pitcher goes 6.2 innings \xe2\x80\x94 a good goal for a starter. That averages about 30 batters. Comparing the .19 difference between Tillman and Chen, that adds up to about seven pitches difference.This second graph is even more indicative of the specific lack of a put-away pitch. It tracks the total number of occasions where a pitcher has two strikes on the batter (could be 0-2, 1-2, 2-2, or 3-2) \xe2\x80\xa6 noting what happens in this situation.Two Strikes in the Count \xe2\x80\x93 Plate Appearances / Strikeouts / Percentage of K\xe2\x80\x99s with 2 Strikes / Batting Average Against PitcherPAK% of K\xe2\x80\x99sBAATillman35011532.9.199Jimenez37516142.9.181Chen39815037.7.197Gausman2449338.1.193Gonzalez30910634.3.214Britton1277760.6.115\xc2\xa0This charts the exact situations where a put-away pitch is needed. Note that, again, of this list of O\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers, Tillman has the lowest percentage number of strikeouts. Britton, of course, has the ultimate put-away pitch. And Jimenez is difficult to hit, especially when he commands the strike zone.

I would say that his best pitch, when commanded, is his curve. It is brutal and has tremendous drop and \xe2\x80\x9cdepth\xe2\x80\x9d in the zone. Of course, finding that depth is where the devil is in the details.In any event, identifying and deploying a put-away pitch for two-strike situations could be the single item that most helps Tillman kick his career up a notch \xe2\x80\x94 positioning him where he really could be a genuine staff ace. He has many games over the course of a season where he is very, very good. This could make him great.Next: These are the times that try fans' souls.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago "", 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Wednesday Bird Droppings - Camden Chat, a Baltimore ...', ' Today has the potential to be a not fun day.

We were scoreless until\xc2\xa0Manny Machado stepped\xc2\xa0to the plate to lead off the last of the seventh. And his 100th career homer gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 1-0 lead. That brought\xc2\xa0Chris Davis to the plate behind him, and Davis uncorked a solo shot of his own.Later in the inning the Birds got a Hardy RBI-single (with the bases loaded), and a Reimold two-RBI double to run the score to 5-0. While a team like Toronto is rarely going to be out of it (in their minds at least), that effectively ended the competitive portion of the game. Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Barney did smack a solo homer in the eighth, but that was as close as Toronto got.Davis would put out a second solo homer of his own in the last of the eighth, and for good measure Wieters would add a two-run shot to cap off the scoring in an 8-1 Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 victory. Incidentally, that second homer was the 200th of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 career, and his 158th as an Oriole. However the big question is whether or not it was the final homer of his Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 career.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsFor the second consecutive year, Camden Yards was the location for celebrating the clinching of the American League East title. Except that this time it was not the Baltimore Orioles doing the celebrating, but rather the Toronto Blue Jays.There was truly nothing to celebrate about the O\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely embarrassing performance in game one of the doubleheader.

The thinking was that it would be good for him to have a positive to take into the offseason; but was not just the opposite as likely to happen?

Having clinched the division yesterday, the Jays pulled David Price to rest him up for the postseason and did not start any of their regular position players. When the dust settled six hours after the game began, the O's were winners, 6-4.    The game was strange enough from the get-go being as it was moved from its original start time to a 12:05pm start time in hopes of avoiding a rainstorm that might cause problems. The thing about weather forecasts is they're only educated guesses. As it turned out, the rain was there from the beginning of the game. Thick drops fell in the first inning, sapping the mojo of Oriole killer Drew Hutchison, who labored through an inning where he gave up three runs on four hits and one walk. Two of those runs scored when Manny Machado hit his 32nd home run of the year. Even through the pouring rain, Manny managed to hit a ball hard enough that it was crushed into the Orioles bullpen. Take that, Hutchison. He'll end the season with a 13-5 record despite a 5.47 ERA. That's actually stupid. Rain, rain, go away The playing surface was wrecked by the constant downpour. The game went into a delay after only the one inning. That delay lasted for three hours and 25 minutes before the game would resume again. Of course the starters were long gone, the O's Tyler Wilson being cut short by rain in his final start of the season. The game became T.J. McFarland's chance to impress instead.    Sure, McFarland was facing a bunch of nobodies, but he did all that you could want, putting together four strong innings where he kept the ball on the ground even while giving up five hits, so the Jays never threatened too much. The lone run that the Jays scored off McFarland came when Munenori Kawasaki hit a routine groundout while there was a man on third base and less than two outs.    While McFarland was in the game, the O's tagged three different Jays relievers for a run apiece. Who knew that you are allowed to score in more than one inning of a game? Sometimes it seems like the O's don't know it. Machado scored one of them when he hit his second home run of the game, and 33rd of the season. That came off of Chad Jenkins. The rainy mess of a game was good for Machado, who also added two stolen bases on top of his two home runs. Those were numbers 19 and 20 on the year for him, putting him in both the 20-20 club (home runs and stolen bases) and also the 30-20 club. That 20-20 mark has only been done six times in Orioles history before this year. Three of the six 20-20 seasons belong to Brady Anderson, who is now joined by Machado in the Orioles 30-20 club.    Following McFarland, Mychal Givens buzzed through three Jays, striking out the side in a clean inning. If the rest of the game was that easy, that would have been nice for the Orioles. This did not prove to be the case. Of the seven pitchers the O's used, Givens was the only one who did not allow a baserunner. Some allowed more than one. That number included Brad Brach, who began the seventh inning by issuing a leadoff walk to Kawasaki. A single and a double later and Brach had allowed a run with two men still in scoring position. Brach struck out yesterday's hot hitter, Ryan Goins, who had pinch hit for Cliff Pennington earlier in the game. With left-handed Ezequiel Carrera due up, Brian Matusz was summoned to do his job. Here is the thing about Matusz with inherited runners. It hasn't worked out very well this year. Going into today, Matusz had allowed 15 of the 44 runners he inherited to score. That means he strands them about 66% of the time. That's not a good number at all, especially for a pitcher who quite often is brought into a game solely to face one batter.    LOOGY, LOOGY, go away With all of that said, it should come as no surprise to you that, rather than retire Carrera - who will not be mistaken any time soon for one of the game's great left-handed batters - Matusz instead gave up a bases-clearing double. So I guess we'd better make that 17 of 46 inherited runners scoring, dropping that strand rate even lower, to 63%. That's a sub-Ayalan strand rate. That's really bad. The other thing that was bad about it is the game was suddenly interesting - the score was 6-4 and the tying run was at the plate. Even with this being the case, Jays manager John Gibbons never summoned any of his big names. Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista, and Edwin Encarnacion saw no action. It's defensible in a way. Why risk a player in the cold and wet game that was played today? Matusz was bounced after one batter, like you do. Following him was Darren O'Day. That rally was snuffed out, although as O'Day pitched the next inning, he did bring the tying run to the plate once again by hitting Matt Hague with a pitch to lead off the inning. No big deal. A popout and two strikeouts later and the inning was over. Closer Zach Britton also led off his own inning by hitting a Jays batter with a pitch. That was #9 hitter Jonathan Diaz. You never want to put any #9 batter on base, but especially not the #9 batter in THIS forfeit lineup. Lucky for Britton, he's a ground ball machine with slick infielders like Machado behind him, so the next batter, Dalton Pompey, hit an around-the-horn double play to erase the runner. Britton struck out yesterday's terror, Goins, to finally end the festivities. In very un-Oriole fashion, they drew eight walks in this game. Two of those eight walks came around to score.    The Orioles will take the wins. They all count, and the O's still have slim hopes of getting back to the .500 plateau. They can do it only if they sweep the Yankees in the final three games, and, with the pending arrival and unknown severity of Hurricane Joaquin, they might not even get a chance to play all of those games. As things stand now, the Friday opener is set to go off at the standard civilized baseball time of 7:05pm Eastern. Adam Warren and Wei-Yin Chen are the scheduled starting pitchers.

After Toronto clinched the AL East crown in the opener of a doubleheader Wednesday, Blue Jays manager John Gibbons fielded a starting unit consisting entirely of reserves in the nightcap.He posted a similar lineup Thursday, in part because the Blue Jays had celebrated their division crown with champagne, beer and cigars late into the night.Although the Blue Jays are still dueling with Kansas City for the best record in the AL \xe2\x80\x94 a distinction that provides home-field advantage through the postseason \xe2\x80\x94 Gibbons has to balance that objective with the need to keep his players fresh.The Blue Jays started the day with 92 wins, one more than the Royals.""We want to win home field,"" Gibbons said. ""We had a doubleheader yesterday, and we\'ve been going at it hard all year. It made perfect sense not to play (in the) doubleheader after you clinch. Then, coming back and playing an early game today would be like no day off at all for them.""My job is to take care of these guys. Yes, we\'d love to win it but I\'ve got to do what\'s best for these guys \xe2\x80\x94 not what some bozo out there in fantasy land thinks.""Toronto ace David Price was scratched from his scheduled start. Slugging stars Jose Bautista, Josh Donaldson and Edwin Encarnacion also sat out.It became apparent early that the Blue Jays were going to experience a figurative hangover from their big day. Hutchison gave up a one-out single in the first inning and Machado followed with a home run to center.Chris Davis and Steve Pearce then sandwiched doubles around a hit batter for a 3-0 lead.Not long after that, the game was halted. Neither starting pitcher returned.T.J. McFarland (1-2) took over for Tyler Wright and pitched four innings to earn his first win since July 27, 2014.Zach Britton worked the ninth for his 35th save.Ezequiel Carrera drove in two runs and Dalton Pompey had three hits for the Blue Jays, who won the season series 11-8.TRAINER\'S ROOMBlue Jays: SS Troy Tulowitzki (shoulder, back) could return Friday night ""or definitely Saturday,"" Gibbons said.Orioles: 2B Jonathan Schoop bruised his right hand after being struck by a pitch from Hutchison.ON DECKBlue Jays: Toronto needs to win two of three in Tampa Bay to finish with a winning record on the road.Orioles: The Orioles finish the season with a three-game series at home against the Yankees beginning Friday night, although Hurricane Joaquin could shuffle that schedule.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

The starting times at 12:05 p.m. and 7:05 p.m.The teams then conclude the regular season with a matchup on Sunday afternoon.Ivan Nova (6-10, 4.89 ERA) is scheduled to start the first game Saturday, followed by Luis Severino (5-3, 2.77). But that could change if Houston loses on Friday night, assuring New York home-field advantage in Tuesday\'s winner-take-all, wild-card matchup.""Nova would still be the first, but Sevi, we might do something different,"" manager Joe Girardi said.If New York clinches that home game, then Girardi will likely rest his regulars.""The most important thing going through this weekend is to clinch the home field for us,"" he said. ""And in saying that, I don\'t really have plans of playing any one person two games tomorrow. To me, that doesn\'t make a lot of sense, that you would do that physically to the guys and risk injury (or) fatigue.""Baltimore was eliminated from contention earlier this week. The Orioles need a three-game sweep to avoid a losing season.Wei-Yin Chen (10-8, 3.35 ERA) will pitch the opener, followed by Ubaldo Jimenez (12-10, 4.10 ERA).Chen is a pending free agent, meaning this could be the left-hander\'s final appearance with Baltimore. In four years with the Orioles, Chen is 45-32 with a 3.73 ERA.Manager Buck Showalter believes it should be more of the same on Saturday.""I expect him to pitch the way he has most of his time here,"" he said. ""He\'s been very solid all year. Very proud of his health and the things he\'s been able to maintain. Every time he\'s take the mound for us, I like our chances.""Very good evaluation, very good signing.

Davis leads the majors with 45 home runs and has 112 RBIs.He also was named Most Valuable Oriole in 2013. Davis slipped dramatically last year, batting only .197, but has come up with a season that should make him a hot commodity during the offseason, when he too becomes a free agent.""We couldn\'t have been as competitive as we\'ve been this year without him,"" Showalter said. ""I think he was very disappointed at the right things that happened last year.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsOn Thursday, another dreary, wet and meaningless game for the Baltimore Orioles played out with the O\xe2\x80\x99s beating the Toronto Blue Jays, thanks in large part to Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x98s two home runs, two stolen bases, and just Manny continuing to show how good he is.But, what caught my attention were the remarks of Adam Jones, the face of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 franchise.Jones held what ended up being an impromptu news conference, talking about what the offseason could hold for the Orioles.As the face of the franchise, in my opinion Adam\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts should hold a lot of weight. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget Jones\xe2\x80\x99 frustration with the fact that Nelson Cruz and particularly Nick Markakis were not brought back to Baltimore.Adam remarked that resigning Chris Davis needs to be the offseason\xe2\x80\x99s top priority. Jones stated, as quoted in Roch Kubatko\xe2\x80\x99s School of Roch blog:\xe2\x80\x9cObviously, I love playing with him. He plays a hell of a first base. He plays the game, he games up every day no matter what. I\xe2\x80\x99ve grown to admire the way he goes about his business and obviously, the production, that\xe2\x80\x99s just icing on the cake. Because I get to see the guy inside here. To me, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s probably the highest priority, but he\xe2\x80\x99s earned himself a right to go and hear all 29 other offers.\xe2\x80\x9cForty-five (home runs) and 120 (RBIs), that\xe2\x80\x99s video game numbers. He\xe2\x80\x99s earned his right to hear everybody out.\xe2\x80\x9dAdam went on to add that the team cannot replace 40 home runs, as proven by this year\xe2\x80\x99s offense (a subtle and appropriate jab at management).Kubatko reported that Adam plans on meeting with team owner Peter Angelos to push for more spending to keep the clubhouse intact.A lot is made, and maybe overstated about chemistry and coaching in sports. Some people doubt what it means, while others say you can\xe2\x80\x99t have success, no matter the ability of the individuals, without team chemistry. \xc2\xa0More from Baltimore Orioles5/12 - Baltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch5/11 - Baltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues5/11 - Baltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?5/9 - Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Zach Britton to miss 45-60 days with forearm injuryI have always believed that a team needs good chemistry to be successful. There are lots of teams made up of good players who are not successful. A look down I-95 at the Washington Nationals shows that.The Orioles clearly have good coaching, some of the best in baseball. I think most players would say that the chemistry this year was not quite as good without Markakis and Cruz, along with the constant turnover of important pieces of the roster.Both Adam and Buck Showalter have said they want to keep the clubhouse intact.\xc2\xa0 That would mean re-signing the key players, like Chris Davis, Matt Wieters, and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, who are all team leaders.It remains to be seen if that will happen.I will say, if the Orioles want to keep players like Jones, Machado, Jonathan Schoop and others, they must show a commitment to spending money, to getting good, starter-caliber talent (not a collection of spare parts like this year) and to keeping the clubhouse largely intact.Whether or not that happens, at this point, is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess, as not even the team\xe2\x80\x99s beloved manager, or the team\xe2\x80\x99s best player know what to expect.Next: Listing the top 7 Orioles for SeptemberMore from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: September 2015 Top Seven O\\u2019s Players ...', 'Next8 of 9PrevUse your \xe2\x86\x90 \xe2\x86\x92 (arrows) to browseSep 30, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles designated hitter Chris Davis (19) hits a solo home run during the seventh inning against the Toronto Blue Jays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

Overall at this moment he has the MLB-leading 45 home runs with a .258 average and 112 RBIs. Hopefully he can add a few more onto those numbers against the Yankees this finale weekend.Davis also leads the world in strikeouts at 206, which places him yet again on the all-time list in this category. As I have said often lately, more on this after the season ends.For September, Davis played in all 27 O\xe2\x80\x99s games and hit .295 with 10 home runs and 20 RBIs.\xc2\xa0 He had 10 and 22 in August, but the batting average was better in September. So was the OBP at .427!\xc2\xa0 That is a huge number, built up by 18 walks.\xc2\xa0 Also huge is the OPS of 1.112.This was certainly his best month of the year, and surely the second half of the season came at a fortuitous time for Davis\xe2\x80\x99 career and pending free agency.

He gave up two runs on three hits with a homer in two-thirds of an inning. But we know now also that there was a developing physical issue at that point.

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsAs the Orioles wind down their mildly disappointing 2015 season, trying to take stock of the roster going into the off season is somewhat exhausting. However the exercise might shed some light on how the Orioles Front Office should proceed as preparations for the Hot Stove League get underway.The season began with a lot of anxiety about overcoming the loss of 2014 Most Valuable Oriole Nelson Cruz, fan favorite Rightfielder Nick Markakis, and late inning Ace Andrew Miller.\xc2\xa0Live Feed chris davisBaltimore Orioles execute a weird triple play on Boston Red Sox FanSidedBaltimore Orioles: Buck Showalter's Most Memorable Ejections The Baltimore WireWATCH: Chris Davis goes into Bo Jackson mode on bat FanSidedDraftKings Late MLB Picks For April 14 Fantasy CPRBaltimore Orioles: A hot start for Chris Davis could offset a trend of missed postseason appearances The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: How long can one of the best infields in the league stay together? The Baltimore WireThere was good reason for nail biting. A return to the Play Offs was highly dependent on a lot of Orioles Magic, including over achieving Steve Pearce maintaining the level of play that saw him lead the team in WAR in 2014, and cast offs Travis Snider and Alejandro De Aza filling holes left by Cruz and Markakis.While the Orioles were technically alive into late September, any fan will attest that it just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been their year.As the players begin to make their vacation plans for the Fall, let\xe2\x80\x99s rank the top 10 Orioles of 2015.1. Chris DavisThe man they call Crush bounced back in a big way in 2015, raising his batting average by 62 points, his Home Run total by 19, and his RBI total by 40, with three games to go. He leads the Major League\xe2\x80\x99s in Home Runs for the second time in three seasons and his OPS is 200 points higher from 2014 to 2015. All of this while playing almost flawless defense with only 3 errors on the season, good for a .998 Fielding Percentage.Imagine\xc2\xa0if this Chris Davis had been manning First Base during the 2014 ALCS\xe2\x80\xa62. Manny MachadoAfter Manny\xe2\x80\x99s breakout 2013 season, at only 20 years old, many predicted his League leading 51 doubles were an indication of future power. Although correct, few saw it coming this soon. Indeed, Manny has essentially turned almost half of those doubles into Home Runs this season, with 33 long balls and 30 doubles to date. He leads the team in Batting Avg at .287 and WAR at 6.9. His defensive prowess is an afterthought because eye popping plays have become routine. Simply put, Machado has the talent to be the best player in baseball.3. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99DayAndrew Miller was not much of a loss for the Orioles in 2015 due to the performance of O\xe2\x80\x99Day. He leads the team with a 1.54 ERA and has been almost automatic in keeping the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the game with a Walks/Hits per inning ratio (WHIP) under 1.00. O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s ability to miss bats often times makes hitters plain angry and his bulldog attitude gives the bullpen an edge.4. Adam JonesIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a tough year for Jones and yet he still put up All Star numbers while playing outstanding Centerfield. Part of his frustration has been due to rarely being 100% healthy. He\xe2\x80\x99ll finish the season with his lowest Games Played total since 2009 but many of his numbers are not too far off from his 2014 output. He\xe2\x80\x99s the emotional leader of the Orioles who sometimes takes the team\xe2\x80\x99s struggles personally. He\xe2\x80\x99s seemed worn out at times this season but he has a tremendous hunger to win and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be back at full strength in 2016.5. Wei-Yin ChenChen has been the most consistent Starting Pitcher for Baltimore this season and should command a lot of attention in Free Agency as a lefty that rarely walks hitters. He averages 1.2 walks per start versus 5 K\xe2\x80\x99s and obviously leads Orioles starters in WHIP.Live Feed Baltimore OriolesBaltimore Orioles Adam Jones donates $20k to Negro Leagues Museum FanSidedKC Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles: Series Breakdown and Prediction Kings of KauffmanBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch The Baltimore WireFantasy Baseball: 5 waiver wire options who could help in saves FanSidedBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues The Baltimore Wire6. Zach BrittonOne of the top Closers in Baseball, Britton strikes out more than a batter per inning and his ability to get ground ball outs with the top defense in Baseball behind him makes him the perfect pitcher to shut the door for the Orioles.7. Jonathan SchoopOne of the most exciting aspects of the 2015 season has been the emergence of Schoop who has 17 doubles and 15 Home Runs in just over 300 at bats after recovering from injury. He\xe2\x80\x99s also batted a solid .279 while playing excellent defense. Schoop\xe2\x80\x99s stats projected over a full season would make him a top 3 Second baseman in the league, which definitely gives Orioles fans hope for the future.8. Kevin GausmanIt seemed like the light went on for Gausman during the 2014 play offs and he appeared poised to vault to stardom in 2015, however the Orioles knew better and brought him along slowly again. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s last start showed what he is capable of doing when he combines his electric stuff with efficient pitch management. His biggest problem has been consistently finishing hitters off, seeming to be unwilling to use a 4 seam fastball to get hitters chasing up in the zone. If he can put it together, 2016 may be the year he finally realizes his Ace potential.\xc2\xa0More from Chris Davis7/7 - Baltimore Orioles: Chris Davis sets up win in the twilight zone6/27 - Baltimore Orioles complete the sweep of Tampa6/14 - Will Chris Davis Continue His Impressive Home Run Streak?6/10 - Baltimore Orioles: Comeback kids led by Chris Davis6/1 - Baltimore Orioles: Fair is foul, foul is fair9. Ubaldo JimenezJimenez has been the source of much disdain from Oriole fans but he actually was the stopper of the starting rotation over the first few months of the season. He\xe2\x80\x99s been an improvement after a horrid first season in Baltimore and has the ability to dominate at times. He leads the team in Wins and Strikeouts but fans expect more. Although he\xe2\x80\x99s been solid this season it\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible Dan Duquette spends a considerable amount of time trying to move him now that two years of his contract are in the books.10. Caleb JosephJoseph has quietly shown that he can be the starting Catcher of the Baltimore Orioles moving forward, making the decision on Matt Wieters much easier for the Front Office. He\xe2\x80\x99s a solid bat in the back end of the order, currently fourth on the team in RBI, while playing defense at a .996 clip and throwing out 32% of base runners.With some tough decisions to make in the off season, a ranking of the top 10 Orioles of 2015 indicates that Davis is a priority to resign, a solid play should be made for Chen, and the team should pass on Wieters. Furthermore, O\xe2\x80\x99Day will likely command attention as a possible Closer from other teams but unless the Orioles think Mychal Givens is ready for 8th inning duty, O\xe2\x80\x99Day is a high priority as well.Let the Hot Stove League begin!Next: Baltimore Orioles: Hidden advantage on Chris Davis?More from Birds WatcherBaltimore Orioles: Adding Vidal Nuno helps fill out bullpen11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Previewing the 2017 Season11w agoBaltimore Orioles: Manny Machado and O\xe2\x80\x99s have not discussed extension11w agoBaltimore Orioles: O\xe2\x80\x99s receive good news about J.J.

The Orioles won 6-4. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY SportsIt has indeed been a strange season for the Baltimore Orioles. The high hopes after the 96-win 2014 campaign have led to the most common word describing this year \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cdisappointing.\xe2\x80\x9dThe weirdness began early. Spring training was not great, as significant pieces of the team struggled. Bud Norris was dreadful, got terribly sick, and never figured it out. J.J. Hardy was hurt, with an injury we found out this week lingered throughout the year. Matt Wieters was not ready for the beginning of the year.After getting off to a 7-10 start, the Orioles won three straight, the first two of these being a Saturday walk-off homer, 10th-inning shot by David Lough that beat Koji Uehara and the Red Sox 5-4. The next day the Birds pasted them 18-7 on a Sunday with 43,800 fans.But then came the riots. And the O\xe2\x80\x99s would not play again until that weird, zero attendance game on a Wednesday afternoon against the White Sox, winning 8-2 and evening their record at 10-10.The venue for the coming weekend series with the Rays was moved to St. Petersburg, where the Orioles would win two of the three games. But the Orioles were several games played behind everyone else. They would next lose four straight, and thus continued the mediocre up and down season that hovered around .500 \xe2\x80\xa6 getting seven games above on June 28, and falling seven games under on September 7th. \xc2\xa0 They could just never get over the hump and sustain a streak as in recent years.

If you have a very equal number of each, it should mean that your record will be about .500. If you have many more runs scored than allowed, it would stand to mathematical reason that your record should reflect that by being well above 50/50, or, at the end well above 81-81.This does not always work out in real life, which is why they play the games and keep score each day. At the moment of this writing (between games of the Yankees double-header, two games before the end of the season), the Orioles have a 79-81 record. They have outscored opponents this year 700-686, and therefore their record should be a bit better at 82-78.Until recently, the Orioles were actually in the top quarter of teams; and even though the Orioles were 14-13 in September, they were outscored by 31 runs over that one-sixth of the season.Another great oddity in this regard was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 2012 season, where they barely outscored opponents, yet won 93 games. It was the year of winning all of those one-run and extra-inning games. That was a special team, and it spoke so well of them that they were able to do that.Here is a chart over the past five years (remembering that this is lacking the final two games this year), noting what the Pythagorean W/L should be, and what the final record was \xe2\x80\xa6YearRunsAllowedPyth.

And it also shows a rather remarkable similarity in runs scored, with a narrow variable over the five years.But in every year of the past five, except for this year, the Orioles played at least at or better (way better in 2012) than the simple expectation upon total runs scored or allowed. And this adds more weight beyond the general observation that this was a team that never put it together with their pitching and hitting and overall play as a unit. And it shows that there is more than enough blame to go around.Next: The Top 7 Players for the Orioles in September ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"
10/04/2015,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Chris Davis Ends Season on a High Note', 'Oct 4, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Chris Davis (19) celebrates with left fielder Steve Pearce (28) after scoring on a single by catcher Matt Wieters (not pictured) during the first inning against the New York Yankees at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY SportsThe Baltimore Orioles in game #162 of the season looked like the Orioles team that we expected to see finish 2015 with another American League East title and playoffs run. It had many of the elements we anticipated: Chris Tillman as the winning starter, Chris Davis hitting two homers, Matt Wieters and J.J. Hardy contributing in a big way with two hits each, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day setting up Zach Britton to close the door, etc.But this sort of story simply did not happen in enough games in 2015 for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to repeat. As many times as we saw a good game, we would see the offense fall asleep or starters not go deep enough and dig a hole too large to come out of. Literally, it was a 50/50 experience, yielding a final record of 81-81.But there was pleasure to be found in seeing the Orioles win their final five games and sweeping the accursed Yankees. Speaking of the NYY, they do not look like a team that is at all ready for the playoffs.This 2015 Orioles season reminds me of a trip I took many years ago, long before GPS sorts of navigation systems. I was in the mountains of West Virginia and wanted to get to Interstate 81. I was sure my sense of direction would take me southeast to where I would eventually run into the highway. About two hours later I found myself driving back into the same town from which I had originally departed!It was a strange journey for these Birds. The lineup on this final day did not look very much like that of opening day. Chris Tillman was the starter for each, and Manny Machado was at third base \xe2\x80\x94 playing every game of the season as the only MLB player to do such in 2015. Ryan Flaherty and Steve Pearce were in both lineups, but playing in different positions. Travis Snider, Alejandro De Aza, and Delmon Young were starters, and Tommy Hunter pitched in relief.Along the way of the circuitous ride the Orioles have taken over these past six months, a total of 48 players made appearances: 26 position players and 22 pitchers.Chris Davis put on a show in his final two at-bats, feared by many to be the last of his Baltimore career. Each was a classic Davis dinger: an opposite field fly that demonstrates his great strength, and a ball met in front of the plate and pulled high and deep onto the flag court.Davis, between the 2013 and 2015 campaigns hit exactly 100 homers \xe2\x80\x94 53 and 47 respectively. In his other three seasons with the O\xe2\x80\x99s he hit a total of 61.\xc2\xa0 That will be so difficult to replace, and really, the Orioles need to make every effort to keep him here.

He entered the game only one ahead of Nelson Cruz. I looked into Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s game with the A\xe2\x80\x99s early on to see how Cruz was doing and noticed him missing from the lineup. A little research revealed that he was out with a groin injury that has been plaguing him. He did finish the season at .302, along with his 44 home runs. But can he do that three more years and justify the contract?So now we begin a time of reviews, grades, postmortems, etc\xe2\x80\xa6 to be followed by all the offseason news and analyses of what to do moving forward. I honestly like the offseason and its intrigue, but nothing beats a real baseball game. Frankly, it is already too cold and I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to spring!So stick with us throughout the offseason here at The Baltimore Wire. As you likely understand, we don\xe2\x80\x99t break news, but we give early opinion and analysis upon it. So come check out your thoughts against ours.Next: All Orioles Free Agents Say They Want to Return to Orioles ', 'thebaltimorewire.com'), ('Orioles hit .500 thanks to departing free agents putting ...', ' The 2015 Orioles are not a losing team. They made sure of it in their final game on Sunday afternoon, finishing off a sweep of the Yankees to close out their season with a 9-4 win. At 81-81, the season wasn\'t a winning season, but it was not a losing one, either. Orioles fans will not have to spend all offseason wondering if this was the first of another streak of 14 straight losing seasons.    Though the game was mostly meaningless for the O\'s, since their postseason hopes have long since been extinguished, there was still a lot at stake, so to speak. The game being played at home meant that it was the last Orioles home game for a number of the pending free agents. Chris Davis, Matt Wieters, and Darren O\'Day, all of whom have been around for all of the recent winning years, turned in what could prove to be their final games as Orioles. As a curtain call for those guys, the game could hardly have gone better. Davis delivered a two out double in the first inning, followed by Wieters hitting a two-run single inning off of Yankees starter Michael Pineda. Neither of these gentlemen was done showing off there, either. The Orioles have hit Pineda well this year despite that one game where they struck out 16 times against him. Tillman\'s battle to get an ERA under 5 One reason the Orioles had nothing to play for in this game was Chris Tillman, illustrated very clearly in the fact that he was a stalwart for last year\'s division winning team whereas this year he entered this final game needing at least a decent outing in order to get his season ERA under 5.00. It\'s not like a 4.94 ERA would be much better, either.    Tillman tried to give those runs away almost immediately, giving up an automatic double to Greg Bird the first batter he faced after the O\'s took an early lead. Two groundouts later, Bird scored, bringing the Yankees back to within a run. They would not score again in the inning. It could have been a lot worse.    Sometimes what you need is a little help from your friends. The O\'s extended Tillman\'s cushion by knocking Pineda from the game in the fourth inning. Wieters led off the inning with a double, his second hit of the day. He didn\'t have the most style points of the O\'s pending free agents, but if those are our last memory of Wieters in an O\'s uniform, it could have been a lot worse. Pineda got the next two batters out before giving up a single to J.J. Hardy, which scored Wieters and put the Orioles up 3-1. The pitching changes that prove Joe Girardi actively hates all other human beings People make jokes about Yankees manager Joe Girardi and his binder that tells him what to do. Today the binder told him to use nine pitchers to work eight innings. There is no world in which this is not incredibly stupid. His revolving bullpen carousel went a long way towards sending the game to a length of 3:39, which as it worked out made the Orioles in the final game of the regular season. Every other game ended before this one.    Hilariously for us, maybe less hilarious for Girardi, his constant tinkering resulted mostly in failure. Girardi pulled Pineda in the fourth inning, apparently with the intention of getting Chris Capuano, a lefty who has literally been designated for assignment four different times by the Yankees this season, in the game to face Ryan Flaherty. What the heck are you doing, dude? Flaherty made the Yankees pay by ripping a double into right field. Girardi then intentionally walked Nolan Reimold - really - in order to face another lefty, Gerardo Parra, another pending free agent, although he\'s spent much less time here. Parra, too, made Girardi pay, driving in two runs with a single to center field. On the play, the Yankees tried to throw out Reimold advancing to third, unsuccessfully. Parra tried to take second on the throw. He was called out on a close play. Despite replays that\xc2\xa0clearly showed Parra\'s back leg beating the tag, the replay center did not overturn the call. Nonetheless, the Orioles pulled ahead, 5-1, on the play. This was the first of five mid-inning pitching changes made by Girardi in the game.    The fated dingers Davis fain would deliver Let\'s be honest, what we all wanted was to see Davis homer one last time. Girardi sent out Bryan Mitchell to begin the fifth inning. Like many of his peers, it was not his day. Mitchell issued a walk to Manny Machado, which only put a runner on base for Davis. That means more delicious RBIs! Davis blasted a home run into the O\'s bullpen, his MLB-leading 46th of the season. He was not done yet. These two runs would prove to be crucial later in the game. Tillman allowed another run before departing after 5.1 innings. There was a runner on third as Tillman left the game. If T.J. McFarland had allowed the inherited runner to score, Tillman\'s ERA would have been over 5. The runner was stranded. Tillman ended up at a 4.99 on the year. Moral victory? I don\'t know. He gave up seven hits and walked four in his 5.1 innings. That\'s a bad day. New York pulled closer with two runs in the seventh inning. Three straight singles kicked McFarland out of there. He was followed by Brad Brach, who has looked tired for a little while. He looked tired today too, issuing a walk to load the bases before getting an out on a run-scoring fielder\'s choice and a popout to end the threat. At 7-4, the game was in striking distance. That\'s where it stayed until the eighth inning, when Girardi bindered his way into oblivion again. Girardi sent out lefty Justin Wilson to face David Lough, who struck out. Girardi then brought out an entirely different lefty - Andrew Miller - to face Parra. Miller walked Parra, then retired Machado on a popout. Due up next was the man of the hour, Davis. Having just blown through two lefties against crappy-hitting Orioles lefties, Girardi summoned a right-handed pitcher, Caleb Cotham, who began the day with a 5.79 ERA in 11 games, to face Davis. The announced crowd of 33,224 at Camden Yards, sensing this might be the end of the line for Davis as an Oriole, gave him a standing ovation as he came up to the plate.    Crummy righty against Davis? Maybe I\'m wrong - maybe Girardi doesn\'t hate all other humans. Maybe he wanted to give a nice parting memory to Davis and Orioles fans. If that was his goal, he succeeded. Cotham made a bad pitch, because duh, and Davis smashed it onto the flag court in right field, to the delight of all assembled Orioles fans. The second home run of the day for Davis was his 47th of the year. If that does end up being the end, what an end. O\'Day pitched the top of the eighth inning, retiring the Yankees in order, which allowed the O\'s crowd to serenade him one last time with, ""O\'Day, O\'Day, O\'Day, O\'Dayyyyyy"" Well, maybe he\'ll come back? Zach Britton closed out the Yankees in the ninth inning to put the 2015 season in the books. They aren\'t winners headed for the postseason, but they aren\'t losers either. There are 182 days remaining until the next Orioles game.

What would we expect them to say? \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I hate it here and can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to go someplace that will finally pay me what I\xe2\x80\x99m worth!\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles are going to have some money to spend, and I think we can hope for at least a couple of these players to get re-signed. A skeptic could say that signing all of them really does not move the team forward, as all the Orioles would be doing is retaining the .500 lineup of 2015 \xe2\x80\xa6 there is need for a frontline starter, corner outfielder, etc., etc.Let\xe2\x80\x99s get a \xe2\x80\x9cwant to stay\xe2\x80\x9d quote from each of the six free agents, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll begin with the one everyone would most like to retain \xe2\x80\xa6Chris DavisDavis is not only the most desired Oriole to have return to the nest next year, he may be the most sought after free agent of them all. And of course there is the Scott Boras factor.But this is what Davis has said (Roch Kubatko\xe2\x80\x99s column) about staying \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cI would love to be here. I would love to be back here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that from Day 1. My wife and I love Baltimore. We love playing for the Orioles and these fans, but it\xe2\x80\x99s out of my hands now.\xe2\x80\x9dThere was also a statement of dissatisfaction this past week that the Orioles had not yet reached out to him about a deal, though that contradicts earlier statements about not wanting to have such conversations interfere with the regular season. As well, Showalter indicated maybe more has happened than Davis knows. And of course there is the Scott Boras factor \xe2\x80\x94 wanting his clients to try out the market and get teams into a bidding war.The latest numbers on Davis have him at .258 with 113 RBIs and 45 homers. He did not get a lot of balls to hit on Saturday. He remains one round-tripper ahead of Nelson Cruz as of this writing.We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a lot more to write about Davis\xe2\x80\x99 season and the free agency situation.Wei-Yin ChenChen finished his season on Saturday with a win over the Yankees and a very solid performance, though the Yankees did not exactly load up the lineup against him.The Orioles really did get a lot of bang for the buck from Chen and his four years in Baltimore. For about $16 million they got 706.2 innings of 3.72 ERA pitching, with a 46-32 record and WHIP of 1.25.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a deal.Chen said Saturday in his post-game comments \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cI would be happy if I was given the chance to come back here. But sometimes as a professional player, it\xe2\x80\x99s inevitable that you have to change teams and adapt to a new environment. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where I will pitch next year, I just know I will do my best to pitch each game.\xe2\x80\x9dIt would be great to have him, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure he is as happy as he might portray. The minor league game he was sent to do this year did not sit well, nor does he often look happy when taken out of games \xe2\x80\x94 seeming to believe he\xe2\x80\x99s being given a too-fast hook.The great offseason site of information (especially about free agency) is MLB Trade Rumors, and they wrote a while back about Chen\xe2\x80\x99s free agency. If the Orioles do the qualifying offer, teams may not be as quick to jump on it and lose draft compensation, thus giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s a better shot at a multi-year deal. Their article said \xe2\x80\xa6Chen faces\xc2\xa0a robust mid-tier pitching market\xc2\xa0that\xc2\xa0includes a number of different risk/reward profiles (take, for instance, pitchers like\xc2\xa0Mat Latos,\xc2\xa0Brett Anderson, and\xc2\xa0Scott Kazmir) and\xc2\xa0many hurlers that won\xe2\x80\x99t be weighed down by draft compensation.And of course there is the Scott Boras factor.Matt WietersAnd of course there is the Scott Boras factor \xe2\x80\xa6 for the third time. It just seems like a couple of years ago that Wieters was drafted with all the expectations of Maurer with power. Is 100 home runs the fulfillment of that? That is what he has now hit for the Orioles.I was actually at his second game as an Oriole on May 30, 2009. He got his first hit that evening, a triple off Justin Verlander \xe2\x80\x94 one of only four in his career.Wieters said during spring training \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cI think every player\xe2\x80\x99s dream is to be able to win championships and be able to stay with a team for your whole career. But sometimes the business side doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work that way and we will worry about that when the time comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Some people believe Wieters could take the qualifying offer, as rare as that is. And of course there is the Scott Boras factor. I\xe2\x80\x99m conflicted on this. Matt has not been what was hoped, yet even a poor-hitting Wieters is well above average for the catcher position in baseball. And he has looked better at the end of this season, much more like he did just before the elbow injury. Maybe he really is now ready to produce at a high level.Darren O\xe2\x80\x99DayThis is one that the Orioles simply cannot let get away. As written recently, I would sign him and make plans to turn him into the primary closer. The Orioles are going to need left-handed starting pitching, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what they can get through free agency or by having T.J. McFarland step into that role. Making Britton a starter is a way to do it more inexpensively.O\xe2\x80\x99Day was quoted on the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 MLB site, saying this about staying \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed interest. I know they like me as a pitcher and as a person, so yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to come back if they\xe2\x80\x99d like to have me back, so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue talking about that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a good run of things the past four years, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason why we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep talking about it.\xe2\x80\x9dGerardo ParraParra came into yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s doubleheader hitting .143 on 6-for-42 in the previous 11 games. He went 6-for-11 with three RBIs in the two games. He is a career .276 hitter, with his best year being this one while with the Brewers. Is he worth re-signing? It depends upon the price.

Quoted by Steve Melewski, he said \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cI like it here. I like the stadium, the fans and the team. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t control that. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens after the season. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to try and stay here.\xe2\x80\x9dSteve PearceAfter a breakout season in 2014, Pearce has been a part of the letdown and disappointment that is 2015 Orioles baseball. He is currently batting .220, though he has hit better in the past month.Dan Connolly of the Baltimore Sun reported him saying \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d love to be back. I\xe2\x80\x99d love for everybody to be back. We have a great group here. But there are a lot of uncertainties in baseball.\xe2\x80\x9dAgain, it depends upon the price.Overall, it is difficult to know what will happen. There is simply no way to put together a decent and contending team without spending some serious money. And after losing Nick Markakis and Nelson Cruz, O\xe2\x80\x99s fans are not going to sit patiently and watch all of the above-named players sign everywhere else because the Warehouse folks won\xe2\x80\x99t come through. But any way you look at this, it is a conundrum.More from The Baltimore WireBaltimore Orioles vs. Kansas City Royals: 4 things to watch8h agoBaltimore Orioles sign first baseman/outfielder Adam Walker1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Late-inning bullpen options in Minor Leagues1 d agoBaltimore Orioles: Could Logan Verrett be a starter?1 d agoNBA playoffs: Wizards vs. Celtics Game 5: Live stream, odds and more2d ago ', 'thebaltimorewire.com')]"
