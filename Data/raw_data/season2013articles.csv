03/31/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles: One more look back - Birds Watcher', 'First off, from me and mine to you and yours, I wish all of Birdland a very happy Easter this morning! As the Baltimore Orioles break camp and get set for Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s opening day game in Tampa, we see a baseball team with high expectations for the first time in 14-15 years. When I say high expectations, I mean that based on last year\xe2\x80\x99s results. In truth the expectations of any season should be based on the potential as put forth in the final roster and the coaching staff. But that aside, these O\xe2\x80\x99s took their fans on a magical run in 2012, and I feel that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that reflected now in the excitement level of the fan base as we get back to baseball for 2013. But before we begin anew, is it not worth looking back just one more time?I wrote a formal season recap of 2012 on October 18th of last year, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that again. However there are a few things that I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken with me from 2012 that I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention. Towards the end of April the Orioles provided us with the first taste of Orioles magic as they came from two behind in the last of the ninth to defeat the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s on a Wilson Betemit walk off homer. That obviously pales in comparison to possibly the most historical game in team history on May 6th when Chris Davis got the win at Fenway Park as the O\xe2\x80\x99s defeated Boston in 18 innings. There were also memorable wins against Philadelphia, Detroit, and New York over the course of the summer.I said this at the time, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it again; the most important win of the 2012 season came on an August Sunday afternoon in Tampa. The O\xe2\x80\x99s defeated the Rays 1-0 in extra innings that day on a Taylor Teagarden RBI-double. That separated the O\xe2\x80\x99s from Tampa just a bit in the standings at that time, which is why I said that it might be viewed as the most important win of the season. I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of opinion, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly debatable. However Tampa finished only three games behind the Orioles in the season standings. Sure you might say that there\xe2\x80\x99s more than one game of wiggle room there, and you\xe2\x80\x99d be right. But if you give that game to Tampa with all other things being the same, the Tampa is then battling out the waazoo with the Birds in the season\xe2\x80\x99s final series to get to the wild card game. While they certainly did battle for sure, there was nothing on the line for Tampa for the most part.Courtesy of Tim Heitman-USA TODAY SportsI suppose that the playoff experience itself will be the most noteworthy aspect of 2012 in the end. During the month of September the Orioles hosted several \xe2\x80\x9cBUCKle Up rallies\xe2\x80\x9d around the community to interact with the fans and to get them excited. Many cities might have scoffed at that type of thing, however Baltimore had gotten so used to baseball not mattering in September\xe2\x80\xa6I think the team wanted the fans to take cues from them on how to behave. Ultimately if your goal is to win a world series, the Birds fell short of that goal. However they allowed the city to fall in love with them again just as they did in the \xe2\x80\x9cglory days.\xe2\x80\x9d I think that\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps the biggest takeaway from 2012, and I believe you\xe2\x80\x99ll see it reflected in the stands in 2013.

04/01/2013,"[('REPORT: Barry Bonds to sign with Orioles - Camden Chat', '   O\xe2\x80\x99s fans waited all winter for a free-agent signing. Any free-agent signing. No, Daniel McCutchen and James Vahalik don\xe2\x80\x99t count. Apparently, Orioles Executive Vice President Dan Duquette has made up for lost time, and in his typical manner, he went way outside the box to do it.    According to various media reports, the Orioles have signed 48-year-old Barry Bonds to a 1-year, $15 million contract, pending a physical:      CHICAGO - The Baltimore Orioles have signed semi-retired slugger Barry Bonds to fill their need at DH for the 2013 season.    Bonds, thought to have been in retirement, had never stopped expressing a desire to play. But at age 48, no team had contacted him in six years. Until Sunday, when Orioles Executive Vice President for Baseball Operations Dan Duquette picked up the phone.   ""We have a need for a DH with the injury situation we have, and any chance I get to make this ball club better, I will. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t care what the industry thinks. I care about the standings at the end of the year. That is who you are,"" Duquette said.     Bonds\xe2\x80\x99 status as an one of the best hitters in the history of the game is without question. He had nine seasons with an OBP over .450, and even in his last season six years ago in 2007 with the Giants, he still had an OPS+ of over 1.000. Dave Gershman at Beyond the Boxscore posed the question just a year ago: Could Barry Bonds still be useful?    Bonds came off a strong season that year. He posted a .429 wOBA, a 158 wRC+, as well as a 4.0 WAR. He wasn\'t worth that many wins since 2004. Take these stats with a grain of salt though. Bonds hasn\'t played baseball since the aforementioned 2007 season, and as he noted on April 11th of 2010, if a team contacted him he would not be in shape to play ""immediately"". However, even with all of the time missed, even with all of the allegations, even though he\'s out of shape and 46 years old, why couldn\'t he be a semi-productive bench bat, DH, or platoon partner at worst?    Obviously, Bonds\xe2\x80\x99 age is the biggest risk in this decision. At age 48, he would be one of the oldest hitters to ever trod to the batters box in MLB history. While pitchers such as Jamie Moyer or Nolan Ryan occasionally find success after age 45, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost unheard of for a hitter. In fact, the record for oldest hitter to drive in a run in a MLB game belongs to a pitcher - the aforementioned Jamie Moyer. Almost every at-bat Bonds takes in an O\xe2\x80\x99s uniform will be historic.    Bonds had spent the last six off-seasons waiting for another team to call. He wanted to play after the 2007 season, but found no suitors. The prospect of not just playing again, but for a young team fresh off a playoff appearance, seems to have energized him: ""There is a bigger goal here and that is winning games,"" Bonds said. ""That is why I signed on. I am glad to sign on.""   Duquette said his meetings with Bonds and his agent went well, and Bonds was noticeably eager to join the team: ""He said, \'The Orioles used to show up to play. Now they show up to win,\' ... That\'s a cultural shift. I thought that was a nice compliment,"" Duquette said. Duquette refused to disclose details of the contract, which is thought to be just one year in length. It contains an opt-out clause on June 1 if Bonds does not reach 250 plate appearances while on the 25-man roster. And yes, according to a court ruling last year, Barry Bonds is actually allowed to own baseball bats again.     SOURCE: Chicago Sentinel     ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
04/02/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles 25-man roster: The pitchers - Camden Chat', "" Starting Rotation     Tom Szczerbowski- USA TODAY Sports  Jason Hammel - RHP2012: 20 GS, 118 IP, 3.43 ERA/3.29 FIPCareer: 189 G/135 GS, 850 IP, 4.78 ERA/4.23 FIP Jason Hammel's very good 2012 has been widely attributed to the increased use of his two-seam fastball and nearly everyone who watched him pitch in 2012 believed that his change in repertoire was most definitely the reason for his improved performance. When he was on the field last year he was definitely the best pitcher in the rotation, he just had trouble staying on the field. He twice missed time during the season with an injured knee, but by all accounts has been healthy throughout spring training. If Hammel can stay healthy and make over 30 starts for the Orioles in 2013, it'll be that much easier for the team to stay in contention. Twitter: Hammel isn't on Twitter, but you can check out his brother @Bill_Hammel. He'll favorite anything nice you say about his brother Jason.      Patrick McDermott - Getty Images     Wei-Yin Chen - LHP 2012: 32 GS, 192 2/3 IP, 4.02 ERA/4.42 FIP    While Hammel was the best performing pitcher in last season's starting rotation, Chen was the most reliable. His 32 starts were 12 more than the next highest number of starts on the team. Not bad for a rookie. He did fade down the stretch, but rebounded nicely when given extra rest at the end of the year. His most memorable start was in game two of the ALDS when he pitched into the seventh inning against the Yankees, giving up just two runs, one earned. Chen is a fly ball pitcher and as such had a bit of trouble with the home run last year, giving up 1.4 HR/9 innings. But when he's on, it's routine fly ball after lazy fly ball. Hopefully we'll see a lot of that this season.      Kim Klement- USA TODAY Sports  Miguel Gonzalez - RHP2012: 18 G/15 GS, 105 1/3 IP, 3.25 ERA/4.38 FIP Was there a better story in 2012 than Miguel Gonzalez? If so it's hard to imagine. From his first start when he wore friend Nick Adenhart's glove to his brilliant performance against the Yankees in the playoffs, it was truly a magical season for our MiGo. But can he repeat? The common sense thinking of it all is that he probably cannot. Given his history and his age before he even made it to the majors, people will say that it's a fluke. But maybe he learned a few things with the Orioles and will just be a late bloomer.      Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports    Chris Tillman - RHP  2012: 15 GS, 86 IP, 2.93 ERA/4.25 FIP Career: 51 GS, 266 2/3 IP, 4.73 ERA/4.97 FIP     After starting the season in AAA in 2012, Tillman performed very well after being called up in July. Despite less than great peripheral stats, Tillman got the job done time and again in the second half of the season. He's another wild card in this rotation. Will he pitch like the Chris Tillman last year, or more like the one over the last several seasons? It's hard to believe that Tillman is just 25 years old; it feels as though he's been around for a long time. Technically, Tillman is starting the season on the disabled list, but he will be called up for Saturday's game so he won't even miss a turn in the rotation.     Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports    Jake Arrieta - RHP 2012: 24 G/18 GS, 114 2/3 IP, 6.20 ERA/4.05 FIP Career: 64 G/58 GS, 334 1/3 IP, 5.33 ERA/4.73 FIP   Jake Arrieta had a rough go of things in 2012. He started the season in the rotation, but was taken out of the rotation at the end of June and demoted to the minor leagues not long after. He's a pitcher who has always been frustrating to watch, at least for me, because he seems like he has the stuff to be a good pitcher but he just can't get it together. He did cut his walks way down last season while maintaining a good K rate, so maybe the results will finally start to show this season. Twitter: Jake can be found on Twitter @JArrieta34.

And for the Orioles, that shut down bullpen was lead by Jim Johnson. Though 2012 was Johnson's first year as the full-time closer, he's been an above average contributor to the O's bullpen since 2008. Johnson's power sinker is his bread and butter, and I expect it'll be more of the same in 2013.      J. Meric - Getty Images    Darren O'Day - RHP 2012: 69 G, 67 IP, 2.28 ERA/2.96 FIP Career: 255 G, 247 2/3 IP, 2.73 ERA/3.54 FIP   Claimed off of waivers before the Orioles even had a new GM, O'Day was an integral part of the team's success last year. His reward was two-year, $5.8M contract with an option for 2015. With a K/9 of 9.3 and a BB/9 of just under two, O'Day was death to lefties and righties alike. O'Day settled in as the set up man for Johnson in the last month of the season, but I'd like to see him in any high-leverage situation this season. He's also kind goofy, as seen in the picture to the left. He can be found on Twitter @DODay56.      Mark L. Baer- USA TODAY Sports    Pedro Strop - RHP 2012: 70 G, 66 1/3 IP, 2.44 ERA/3.59 FIP Career: 115 G, 106 IP, 3.48 ERA/3.63 FIP    I'll be honest: Pedro Strop kind of scares me. When he's on, he's fantastic. That's how he pitched in this year's WBC and he was a joy to watch. His pitches have nasty movement and he throws as hard as anyone on the team. But he also walked 37 batters in 66 innings last year, which is terrifying. If he can't get that number down (and his career walk rate suggests that he might not be able to), it could be disastrous when he goes through a rough stretch.      Joe Nicholson- USA TODAY Sports    Tommy Hunter - RHP 2012: 33 G/20 GS, 133 2/3 IP, 5.45 ERA/5.75 FIP Career: 98 G/75 GS, 469 1/3 IP, 4.77 ERA/5.03 FIP   OK, so those numbers, especially the 2012 numbers, are not good. Not at all. Tommy Hunter has a penchant for giving up home runs with a HR/9 of 2.2 last season, highest on the team by a large margin. But what the numbers above don't tell you is that when Hunter isn't starting, he's really not all that bad. His career numbers as a relief pitcher are just plain better. After he moved to the bullpen permanently in September of last year, his ERA was just 0.71 and batters hit .255/.280/.298 against him. Not to mention his fastball jumped from low 90s to almost 100 mph once he made the switch. Showing that Tommy has a pretty good sense of humor about himself, you can find him at Twitter @TommyGoesBoom.      Joy R. Absalon- USA TODAY Sports    Troy Patton - LHP 2012 - 54 G, 55 2/3 IP, 2.43 ERA/3.26 FIP Career - 78 G, 99 IP, 2.73 ERA/3.58 FIP   The joke about Troy Patton is that he either doesn't exist, or that the Orioles hired an actor to play him because he was criminally underused when he was first called up. We may have to lay that meme to rest after last season, when Patton was used extensively and also was awesome. He only got into 58 games mostly because he spent time on the disabled list with a sprained ankle. And don't call Patton a LOOGY. This guy can get anyone out, regardless of their handedness.        Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports    Brian Matusz - LHP 2012 - 34 G/16 GS, 98 IP, 4.87 ERA/4.69 FIP Career - 86 G/69 GS, 368 IP, 5.36 ERA/4.71 FIP   Oh, Brian Matusz. What is there to say? Well, for one thing, he might get sent down to the minors when Tillman is recalled this weekend. So he better make his time count. After being demoted from the majors last year, Matusz spent some time at AAA to think about what he'd done, and when he returned as a relief pitcher he wasn't half bad. Can he keep it up? Your guess is as good a mine. At least we know he can get lefties out.        Jim Rogash - Getty Images    Luis Ayala - RHP 2012 - 66 G, 75 IP, 2.64 ERA/3.67 FIP Career - 495 G, 521 1/3 IP, 3.35 ERA/3.98 FIP   What is it about Luis Ayala that makes me nervous? His numbers last year were pretty good, after all. Well...except for that fact that he let 44% of his inherited runners score. Yes, that must be why he makes me nervous. Ayala is on a very team-friendly contract this season, so if he flames out at age 35 it's no big loss. But he does have his value in the bullpen, and in my opinion that value is pitching in medium-leverage situations. He's not a mop up guy, but I don't want him protecting a one-run lead with the heart of the lineup coming up either.      Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports  T.J. McFarland - LHP As a Rule 5 draft pick, the next big league game McFarland pitches in will be his first. It looks like the Orioles are going to try and stash the kid in the bullpen to keep him in the organization, but if he's not getting the job done when they call on him he might be headed back to the Indians.      Disabled List    Derick Hingle-USA TODAY Sports  Steve Johnson - RHP Son of Dave was in the mix for the fifth starter spot when he strained a lat muscle towards the end of spring training. Once he gets healthy he'll either take over for a disgraced Jake Arrieta in the rotation or be sent down to AAA Norfolk to wait his turn.     Derick E. Hingle - USA TODAY Sports  Tsuyoshi Wada - LHP Wada is still waiting to make his Orioles debut after needing Tommy John surgery last year. Reports say he'll be pitching again in May so we can hope to see him on the team before the All-Star Break. According to Baseball Reference, Wada's nickname is Dr. K. I wonder who coined that?

(AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Tampa Bay Rays and Baltimore Orioles embrace heightened expectations that accompany success within the rugged AL East, which again figures to be one of the most balanced divisions in baseball. The teams begin the season Tuesday at Tropicana Field, each brimming with confidence and eager to set the tone for achieving a goal of playing deep into October. \xe2\x80\x9cWe feel we have a group that is capable of getting to the playoffs, playing the last game of the year and winning it,\xe2\x80\x9d Rays third baseman Evan Longoria said Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should never run away from expectations,\xe2\x80\x9d Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s hyperbole. We really think it can be done.\xe2\x80\x9d So do the Orioles, who stopped a string of 14 consecutive losing seasons by winning 93 games and beating Texas in the AL wild-card game last fall. One of the challenges this year is to prove their run, which ended with a loss to the AL East champion Yankees in Game 5 of the divisional series, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fluke. \xe2\x80\x9cWe went through a heck of journey together last year. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of people that know what the journey is about, and know what\xe2\x80\x99s expected,\xe2\x80\x9d Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like an eternity since we started spring training,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter added. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like an eternity since we finished in New York last year. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xe2\x80\x9d AL Cy Young Award winner David Price (20-5, 2.56 ERA in 2012) will make his second career opening day start for the pitching-rich Rays, who have the third-best regular season record in baseball over the past five years behind the Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies. The Orioles will counter with Jason Hammel (8-6, 3.43), who welcomes the opportunity to help Baltimore get \xe2\x80\x9coff on the right foot.\xe2\x80\x9d A strong April could be one of the keys to getting back to the postseason. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody knows the division is going to be tough the whole year, so you want to get off to a good start. \xe2\x80\xa6 The Rays are a good team with a good staff, and I hope we can grind out some wins,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles catcher Matt Wieters said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more important to get off to a good start in general just to build yourself some momentum,\xe2\x80\x9d center fielder Adam Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe schedule is not going to change. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to play our division a lot and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure in September, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be heavy-loaded with playing them again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve all got to play the same schedule. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of who\xe2\x80\x99s going to come out on top.\xe2\x80\x9d Despite playing a significant portion of 2012 without Longoria, a three-time All-Star who was sidelined three months with a partially torn left hamstring, the Rays won at least 90 games for the fourth time in five years and finished third in the division behind the Yankees and Orioles. But after making a surprising run to the World Series in 2008 and returning to the playoffs twice over the next four years, anything short of playing deep into October is a bitter disappointment in Tampa Bay. Maddon expects a solid pitching staff led by Price and closer Fernando Rodney to again fuel a strong bid for the division title. He also believes the offense and defense could be more efficient with the addition of infielders James Loney, Kelly Johnson and Yunel Escobar. \xe2\x80\x9cOur goal is not to be watching everybody else play at the end of the year,\xe2\x80\x9d Maddon said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s our mindset.

(AP Photo/Chris O\'Meara)MoreST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore played like a confident bunch that\'s left 2012 behind and is intent on proving a surprising breakthrough season wasn\'t a fluke.Adam Jones keyed a seventh-inning rally with a go-ahead double and Chris Davis followed with a three-run homer Tuesday to help the Orioles launch their quest to return to the playoffs with a 7-4 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays.""Today starts a long journey together, and I\'m curious as everybody else to see where it takes us,"" manager Buck Showalter said.""The season wouldn\'t have ended if we lost today, and it wouldn\'t end if we lose tomorrow, or if we win. That\'s what I keep challenging our guys about,"" he added. ""This is a great group for staying in the moment, staying in reality.""Matt Wieters homered early off AL Cy Young Award winner David Price and later drew an intentional walk from reliever Jake McGee (0-1) before Davis\' towering shot over the right-field wall broke open the game and silenced a sellout crowd of 34,078 at Tropicana Field.Jason Hammel (1-0) allowed three runs and three hits in six innings. Jim Johnson pitched a scoreless ninth for the save.""Last season is over, and everybody in the clubhouse has moved on to this year,"" Wieters said. ""It\'s a good team win. Ham went out there and battled for us. He was able to get us through six innings and turn it over to the bullpen, which is the recipe we want to use.""Despite giving up a two-run homer to Wieters in the first inning and not being particularly sharp in his second career opening day start, Price departed with a 3-2 lead after the Rays scored twice in the sixth.Ben Zobrist hit a solo homer for Tampa Bay in the fourth, then put his team ahead with a sacrifice fly in the sixth. Desmond Jennings drove in the Rays\' other run with a sixth-inning double.Showalter put the game into the hands of his trusted relievers after the five-run seventh. Darren O\'Day allowed an unearned run in the eighth before Johnson, last year\'s major league saves leader, finished the combined six-hitter.""I think we did a lot of really good things today,"" Rays manager Joe Maddon said. ""Our defense was fantastic. ... David getting through six innings without having his best stuff and coming out of the game at 100 pitches with a 3-2 lead. ... Those were nice things. They just got us in one inning.""Both teams enter the season with expectations of contending for the AL East title. The Rays have won at least 90 games four of the past five years, while the Orioles stopped a stretch of 14 consecutive losing seasons by winning 93 games and making the playoffs a year ago, when they finished second in the division behind the New York Yankees.Price is the leader of a deep rotation that kept Tampa Bay in the race despite offensive deficiencies in 2012. The 27-year-old left-hander became the first Tampa Bay pitcher to win 20 games, going 12-1 with a 2.26 ERA over his last 18 starts to edge Detroit\'s Justin Verlander by four points in the Cy Young balloting.The Orioles hopped on the Rays\' ace early. Jones doubled with two outs in the first, then scored on the second opening day homer of Wieters\' career. Baltimore\'s two-time All-Star catcher also homered in an opening day loss to Tampa Bay at Tropicana Field three years ago.Hammel limited the Rays to Zobrist\'s first-inning single until the Tampa Bay second baseman homered on a 3-2 pitch to trim the Orioles\' lead to 2-1 in the fourth.Kelly Johnson drew a leadoff walk in the sixth, when the Rays pulled even on Jennings\' RBI double and took a 3-2 lead on Zobrist\'s sacrifice fly.Price scattered seven hits, walked one and struck out two over six innings. He escaped a bases-loaded jam by getting Davis to hit into an inning-ending double play in the third and pitched his way through potentially troublesome spots in the fourth and sixth after giving up leadoff doubles to J.J. Hardy and Wieters.""I really don\'t think I ever settled into that game at all. It\'s a very tough team, offensively and defensively,"" Price said. ""And the way Hammel threw the ball \xe2\x80\x94 and the bullpen is very good \xe2\x80\x94 giving them two runs in the first inning is something you try to stay away from.""Brian Roberts and Nick Markakis, a pair of players back in Baltimore\'s lineup after missing sizable portions of last season with injuries, got the Orioles going against McGee with one-out singles in the seventh.Manny Machado struck out before Jones hit an 0-2 pitch into the gap in left-center for a two-run double that put Baltimore back on top. The left-handed hitting Davis homered on the first pitch after the intentional walk to Wieters.""It\'s really tough, especially in a situation like that where you\'ve just taken the lead and get the momentum,"" McGee said. ""Even if I walk Adam Jones right there, we\'d still have the lead by one. ... When I know I\'ve got to make one pitch, I\'ve got to be not as anxious to get that pitch done.""NOTES: Rays senior adviser Don Zimmer, who\'s beginning his 65th season in pro baseball, was joined by his family for the ceremonial first pitch. The 82-year-old former Cubs and Red Sox manager is in his 10th season in the Tampa Bay organization. His son, Tom, a scout for the San Francisco Giants, delivered the pitch. ... It\'s the sixth time, including three of the past four years, that the Orioles and Rays have opened the season against each other. ... The 20-year-old Machado, Baltimore\'s third baseman, joined Brooks Robinson, Ron Hansen and Boog Powell as the only players to make opening day starts for the Orioles at age 20 or younger. Robinson did it twice, starting at age 19 in 1957 and at 20 the following year. ', 'www.yahoo.com')]"

There\'s usually a bit about how baseball is like life, how you have brief moments of action but mostly it\'s about planning and anticipation and how even the greatest ballplayers and teams do not succeed much of the time.Oh, we could go on. References to baseball movies like ""Field of Dreams"" or ""The Natural"" are big, too. And there\'s usually a few jokes about how baseball relates to the politics of the day or maybe a famous quote or two. Like how Harry Truman once presciently warned the owner of the Washington Senators to look out for Richard Nixon\'s curve. And these days, there\'s usually an obligatory nod to fantasy leagues and sabermetrics.But we\'re going to mercifully dispense with the baseball pseudo-philosophy (or leave it to George Will, its leading purveyor) to raise a more pressing opening day question: Has Baltimore fallen back in love with the Orioles? var adSkipCounter = 0; Last fall was a thrill ride, a joyous return of meaningful Major League Baseball in September followed by actual games in October. Nobody saw it coming until it did. The Orioles just kept winning close games, playing like men possessed. Oriole Park at Camden Yards became the hottest ticket in town, and we had great fun seeing the team win some big-time nail-biters.Perhaps it\'s impossible to maintain that level of fan excitement, particularly at the start of baseball\'s endurance-taxing 162-game schedule, or maybe we are still catching our collective breath from the Ravens Super Bowl win (or distracted by so much off-season turnover in the Ravens roster), but the fan base seems in a pretty ho-hum mood to us.That\'s not to suggest it\'s not a distinct improvement from a year ago. The team reports that sales of both tickets and Orioles-related gear are up this season after last season\'s record increase. But team officials have been cautious in their assessment. After opening day has come and gone, average attendance for home games is unlikely to hit the kind of numbers (30,000 or more per game) of a decade ago.Could it be a matter of low expectations? The Orioles may have been the biggest surprise of last season, but it appears that sportswriters are ready to be surprised again. Few predict a return to the playoffs, even fewer that the team will win the American League East. Could it be that Orioles fans have been reading those clippings?Forty miles to the South, the D.C. fan base is contemplating a World Series appearance, but Orioles fans seem to be taking a wait-and-see attitude. Maybe that\'s prudent. Maybe that\'s the nature of a more cerebral sport than the one played with a helmet and pads. Or because the Orioles aren\'t blessed with a high-profile young phenom duo like Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper, and their fans not as starved for a championship as Washingtonians.Still, we can\'t help but get the feeling that Baltimore and the Orioles had some really good dates together but just aren\'t certain whether to make a commitment quite yet. Oh, we care. Absolutely. Love the Orioles. But treat them like the champion Ravens, fly those flags, wear those jerseys, buy those tickets, scream at the television, track player batting averages and earned run averages obsessively and really take the plunge?Let\'s talk in June or July. You doing anything around the All-Star break?This is, of course, what so many years of cellar-dwelling in the American League East has wrought. The Orioles still fly under the radar even in Birdland. That the manager of the Tampa Bay Rays says they\'ll be in the hunt this fall doesn\'t change much. (He couldn\'t just dismiss the team the Rays finished three games behind last season \xe2\x80\x94 and just lost to in their own home opener \xe2\x80\x94 as that would make him look pretty inept).We don\'t know what kind of team the Orioles will be this year. Last year might have been a fluke or it might have been a rebirth. But finding out is bound to be fun for the fans willing to embrace a pretty lovable bunch of ballplayers. Or, as Roy Hobbs once told Ray Kinsella at a Durham Bulls game while contemplating the existential meaning of the infield fly rule, let\'s play two but leave Dick Nixon back in that Iowa corn.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

He is 9-for-15 (.600) with four homers and 16 RBI.The Orioles trailed 5-4 before loading the bases with one out in the eighth against Casey Fien (0-1).

04/07/2013,"[('Orioles 5, Twins 6: A poor outing by Chris Tillman helps ...', "" The Orioles lost their second game of the season tonight in a heartbreaking fashion. The starting pitching from Chris Tillman was terrible, giving the Orioles two bad starts in a row. And the go-ahead run for the Twins reached base on an ugly error by Chris Davis, reminding us that he's not perfect after all.  Tillman started the game with a great first inning, setting down the Twins 1-2-3 with strikeouts of Joe Mauer and Josh Willingham. I had high hopes for him after that, but it unraveled quickly.  Tillman was handed a lead in the very first inning thanks in part to some shaky defense from the Twins pitcher Vance Worley. After Manny Machado singled and Nick Markakis doubled with one out, Adam Jones hit a ball that went all of six feet in front of home plate. Machado raced in to score and by the time Worley got to the ball, he should have just held on to it. There was no way he was going to get Jones at first, but he tried anyway and the ball got away from the first baseman on the poor throw. That allowed Markakis to score and give the O's a 2-0 lead. Jones was stranded at first base as Worley retired Davis and Matt Wieters to end the inning.  Things got ugly for Tillman in the second inning. He only gave up one run, but he was lucky that's all it was. A single by Justin Morneau and double from Ryan Doumit put runners on second and third with no outs, and after a strikeout of Trevor Plouffe, Tillman walked Chris Parmelee to load the bases. Brian Dozier hit a sacrifice fly to center field for the second out, meaning Tillman just had to retire Pedro Florimon, one of the worst hitters in baseball. What he actually did was walk Florimon to re-load the bases, before striking out Aaron Hicks to end the inning. It was one of the worst innings a pitcher could have where only one run scored.     The second inning was ugly, but the third inning was just plain horrible. Tillman walked Willingham with one out and followed that with a single from Morneau. The next three batters each knocked in at least one run as Doumit singled in Willingham, Plouffe hit a long fly ball to center field that Adam Jones made a very good catch on, which resulted in a sac fly. And then Parmelee hit a two-run homer to cap off the four-run inning.     The O's got one run back in the bottom of the inning. Again Machado and Markakis were on base, and this time it was Davis who singled in a run. That made the score 5-3, but Wieters wasn't able to extend the rally.  I knew the Orioles would be able to chip back from their two-run deficit if given the chance, and I really hoped Tillman would be able to get his act together. Well, the Twins didn't score any more runs off of him, but he was far from good. Florimon reached on a bunt single, but was erased on a fielder's choice by Aaron Hicks. Hicks was dancing all over the place and first, and when he finally took off he realized why everyone is always saying that you don't run on Matt Wieters. He was thrown out easily at second base. With two down Tillman then gave up a single to Mauer and walked Willingham again, and that was it for him. Buck Showalter replaced him with T.J. McFarland, who retired Morneau on one pitch.     Tonight was the major league debut of McFarland, the Rule 5 pick from Cleveland. And I have to say, he looked pretty impressive indeed. In the fifth inning he gave up a seeing eye ground ball single to Parmelee, but was otherwise perfect in his 3 1/3 innings pitched. He even struck out five batters, and after watching Tillman it was refreshing to see a guy pitching in the strike zone. It was easy to see why the Orioles want to keep him around.  The Orioles came back to tie the game in the bottom of the fifth. Nate McLouth, Machado, and Markakis singled to load the bases and Jones came through again. He also singled to center field and McLouth and Machado were able to score. Markakis went to second and it looked like they might have a big rally on their hands. Sadly they did not, as Davis, Wieters, and J.J. Hardy were retired.  The Orioles and Twins traded zeroes in the sixth through eighth innings as Josh Roenicke relieved Worley and pitched pretty well. After McFarland came out of the game, Darren O'Day pitched a scoreless eighth and with the game tied going into the ninth, the Orioles turned to Jim Johnson.  After getting Jamey Carroll to ground out, Johnson induced another ground ball from Hicks that went to Davis at first base. It looked like it would be a routine play, but the ball went right through Davis's legs and Hicks was safe. Argh, Chris Davis! First you don't hit a home run and then you make a crucial error? I don't know what I ever saw in you! (Just kidding, Chris Davis, I still love you.) Johnson struck out Mauer for the second out, but then completely lost the strike zone and walked Willingham on four pitches. He got another ground ball from Morneau but unfortunately it went back up the middle for a single, knocking in Hicks and costing the Orioles the lead.  With Glen Perkins in to get the save for the Twins, the Orioles were quiet. McLouth, Machado, and Markakis were retired in order and the game was over. They are now 0-2 in one-run games, for those keeping track.  Tomorrow the O's will go for the series win with Jason Hammel on the mound facing Pedro Hernandez. No, I don't know who he is either.   "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Hicks, Twins Rally To 4-3 Victory Over Orioles \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' BALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Minnesota Twins aren\xe2\x80\x99t playing like a team content to muddle through rebuilding. Two series into the season, a team that lost more than 90 games in each of the past two seasons has a pair of series victories and some newfound confidence. Aaron Hicks ended a 0-for-13 skid with a tiebreaking RBI single in a two-run seventh inning, rallying the Twins past the Baltimore Orioles 4-3 on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s early in the season but our goal is to win series,\xe2\x80\x9d Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. \xe2\x80\x9cGet our fans back and excited about this baseball team in a positive way. \xe2\x80\xa6 This was a really good series and although it\xe2\x80\x99s early in the season, we have to continue this for a while.\xe2\x80\x9d J.J. Hardy homered for the Orioles, who dropped the final two games of the weekend series and fell to 0-3 in one-run games after winning 29 of 38 last year. It was Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s first series loss to the Twins since July 2010 \xe2\x80\x94 and it hinged on the two-run rally and a ball that got lost in the sun in Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s two-run third inning. Trailing 3-2, the Twins started their comeback when Jason Hammel (1-1) hit Trevor Plouffe on the left elbow leading off the seventh and Wilkin Ramirez followed with a single. After Brian Dozier\xe2\x80\x99s sacrifice bunt, pinch-hitter Chris Parmelee tied it with a sacrifice fly and Hicks got his go-ahead hit. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just trying to get a pitch to drive,\xe2\x80\x9d Hicks said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was able to get it over the guy\xe2\x80\x99s head. As long as I got the hit and RBI, that\xe2\x80\x99s all that matters.\xe2\x80\x9d Gardenhire said Hicks, a rookie who had never played above Double-A before this year, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pressing despite the early season slump. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not easy for him,\xe2\x80\x9d Gardenhire said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to get hits. To come up big in that situation was good for us and him.\xe2\x80\x9d Anthony Swarzak (1-0), activated from the disabled list before the game after missing time with fractured ribs, pitched 1 1-3 innings of scoreless relief. Glen Perkins pitched the ninth for his second save. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer gave the Orioles the lead in a three-run second. Adam Jones drew a leadoff walk and one out later, Hardy lined a changeup from Pedro Hernandez into the seats in left-center for his second home run. Nolan Reimold then singled, went to second on a groundout, Alexi Casilla walked and Nick Markakis made it 3-0 with a single. The Twins loaded the bases against Hammel in the third on a pair of walks and a hit batter, and the Orioles starter appeared to be out of the inning when Justin Morneau lofted a two-out fly to center. But Jones lost the ball in the sun, and it dropped for a two-run double. \xe2\x80\x9cIt went in the sun and (I) missed it,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cShould have got around it better. Mistake, cost us a couple runs. Hammel\xe2\x80\x99s out there giving his heart out and a play like that, I got to make it. The first two were in the sun and I caught `em, the last one I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, so it\xe2\x80\x99s my fault. I got to catch the ball.\xe2\x80\x9d Hernandez, recalled from Triple-A Rochester to start in place of the injured Cole De Vries, allowed three runs and four hits over five innings in his second major league start. He walked three and struck out three and said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nervous in his 2013 debut. \xe2\x80\x9cNot really,\xe2\x80\x9d Hernandez said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis game is for men, this game is not for a child.\xe2\x80\x9d Hammel worked 6 2-3 innings, allowing four runs and four hits. He walked three and struck out three. \xe2\x80\x9cHe should have been through six scoreless except for the sun,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s not going away. We just weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to overcome it. We had some people out there, just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a hit. Hits were at a premium today.\xe2\x80\x9d NOTES: De Vries (right forearm strain) was placed on the 15-day disabled list and LHP Tyler Robertson was optioned to Triple-A. \xe2\x80\xa6 Two injured Orioles on the DL \xe2\x80\x94 DH Wilson Betemit (right knee sprain) and 2B Brian Roberts (right hamstring strain) \xe2\x80\x94 will report to the team\xe2\x80\x99s spring training complex in Sarasota, Fla., this week for rehabilitation. \xe2\x80\xa6 When the Orioles play in Boston on Monday afternoon, it will be their third home opener of the season, following their own on Friday and the season opener in St. Petersburg, Fla., against the Rays on April 1. \xe2\x80\xa6 Carly Rae Jepsen of \xe2\x80\x9cCall Me Maybe\xe2\x80\x9d fame threw out the ceremonial first pitch. \xe2\x80\xa6 Hammel hit two batters, matching his total from 20 starts in 2012. \xe2\x80\xa6 Reimold left the game with right hamstring tightness after six innings. After the game, Reimold said he thought he\xe2\x80\x99d be ready to play Monday, but Showalter was behind closed doors discussing contingency plans. \xe2\x80\xa6 Showalter said RHP Luis Ayala went to a local hospital late in the game with an unspecified illness and would not accompany the team to Boston on Sunday.

On Wednesday night, the Boston Red Sox may fail to sell out Fenway Park for the first time in nearly a decade.Including their home opener Monday, the Red Sox have sold out a major-league-record 794 consecutive games, a streak that dates to the 2003 season, the year before the team ended an 86-year drought and won the World Series. Since then, rain or shine, freezing temperatures or summer heat, the Red Sox have sold all 37,000 or so seats at Fenway Park.The Red Sox\xe2\x80\x99 streak dwarfs the 455 consecutive sellouts by the Cleveland Indians in the 1990s, and it is nearly five times as long as the second-longest current streak, 169 games, by the San Francisco Giants. (The Philadelphia Phillies\xe2\x80\x99 sellout streak ended last August at 257 games.)But even Red Sox fans, who are among the most involved in baseball, finally have reasons to stay away. The team\xe2\x80\x99s epic collapse in 2011 was followed by a last-place finish last season. The improvements to Fenway Park, including seats added to the top of the Green Monster, are no longer a novelty. Ticket prices have pushed up over the years. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Tickets in April are also more difficult to sell because the weather is cooler and children are in school. Worse, the Red Sox will play 17 home games this month, a team record for April, making it that much harder to sell every ticket. The streak may end as soon as the second home game of the season \xe2\x80\x94 Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s matchup against the Baltimore Orioles \xe2\x80\x94 when the Red Sox expect ticket sales to surpass 30,000, but not reach capacity.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  If the sellout streak does continue Wednesday \xe2\x80\x94 the Red Sox are, after all, off to a good start and the weather has warmed, at least temporarily \xe2\x80\x94 it will probably end at some other point in April, Larry Lucchino, the president of the Red Sox, said in a telephone interview Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cCombined with the disappointment of last season and the disaster the year before, we are anticipating the streak coming to an end,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.It does not help the streak that interest has dipped on the resale market, where the average price of tickets for the home opener at Fenway Park fell to $171.68 this year, about half what they cost for the home opener last year, according to TiqIq.com, which tracks online ticket resellers. Fans could have paid as little as $63 to see Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game, down from $103 last season.The prices for tickets to Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game have fallen faster. Fans can find tickets for as little as $12 for that game, about 75 percent less than the cheapest seat for the second home game of the season last year, according to TiqIq.com.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  It should be noted that sellout streaks \xe2\x80\x94 including Boston\xe2\x80\x99s and San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 come with asterisks. For instance, The Boston Globe reported last May that the Red Sox had cut off ticket sales in the seventh inning of a Wednesday night game against Oakland with an estimated 300 tickets still unsold. Still, the game was declared a sellout.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The explanation the Red Sox provided was that the hundreds of free tickets they had distributed to charities and others, the standing room tickets that had been sold and the many regular tickets that had been purchased added up to a total that was larger than Fenway\xe2\x80\x99s capacity. Thus, a sellout, which the Red Sox executives defended as a standard definition under Major League Baseball guidelines.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Likewise, The San Francisco Chronicle went to a Giants-Colorado Rockies game at AT&T Park in September and found big patches of empty seats in the upper deck.

With standing room, attendance can hit 39,000. Even so, Fenway Park is considered the third smallest stadium in baseball, trailed only by those in Oakland, Calif., and in St. Petersburg, Fla., where the Athletics and the Tampa Bay Rays seal off entire sections because of lackluster ticket sales.Regardless of how long it lasts, and how it is defined, the Red Sox\xe2\x80\x99 sellout streak is the result of a confluence of factors, the most important being a winning team. When the run began May 15, 2003, with Pedro Martinez beating the Texas Rangers, 12-3, the team \xe2\x80\x94 under a new management group that featured Lucchino, the owners John Henry and Tom Werner and General Manager Theo Epstein \xe2\x80\x94 was embarking on a long run of strong baseball that included World Series titles in 2004 and 2007.The new group presided over a $285 million refurbishment of Fenway Park, which celebrated its centennial last season. Seats were added on top of the wall in left field and a concourse and roof deck were added in right. Club seats were installed behind home plate, and Yawkey Way was closed to traffic during games. In all, 3,502 seats have been added over the last decade.

They do not necessarily see the need to go again now.And because the market for reselling tickets has slipped substantially, fans who usually buy full-season ticket packages with the intent of reselling the games they do not want online may now think that is a losing proposition.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Lucchino said season-ticket renewal rates were 88 percent to 90 percent this year, down from about 95 percent in recent years.While the Red Sox distribute free tickets, Lucchino maintained that during the long sellout streak, they have not resorted to buying up remaining tickets just before game time to keep the streak going. And, he added, they are not going to start doing so now. The team did give out commemorative baseballs on the days when the sellout streak reached 500, 600 and 700 games. But the Red Sox have no plans to commemorate the sellout streak \xe2\x80\x94 whenever it ends \xe2\x80\x94 by putting up a sign in the stadium, the way the Indians did.\xe2\x80\x9cWe hope to really thank them with a decent season,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of Red Sox fans. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would be the best thank you of all.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story       We\xe2\x80\x99re interested in your feedback on this page.

Still, his historic four-game start to the season probably prompted casual sports fans across the country to ask themselves, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is this Chris Davis guy and where did he come from?\xe2\x80\x9dWell, everyone here in Baltimore knows that the Orioles acquired him from the Texans Rangers before the trade deadline in 2011. But Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports has shared some interesting details from the deal.As it turns out, the Orioles more or less bought the slugging first baseman from the Rangers for $2 million.Rosenthal chatted with former Orioles president of baseball operations Andy MacPhail, who made the savvy deal with the Rangers in his final months on the job back in 2011. MacPhail said the Rangers only wanted to give up pitcher Tommy Hunter for reliever Koji Uehara, but MacPhail was pushing for the Rangers to also throw in Davis, then a 25-year-old with power potential who kept getting shuttled from the big leagues to the minors. var adSkipCounter = 0; \xe2\x80\x9cMacPhail said he had a plan to make it happen -- trade first baseman Derrek Lee to the Pittsburgh Pirates to save about $2 million, then include that money in the deal for Davis, who would replace Lee,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosenthal wrote in his latest column for FOX Sports. \xe2\x80\x9cThe deal, then, would be cash-neutral -- the Orioles also would send a small amount of cash to the Pirates, but save a small amount in the exchange of Uehara for Davis and Hunter.\xe2\x80\x9dIt turns out that was enough to get the deal done.And in hindsight, the deal clearly favored the OriolesUehara made 22 appearances down the stretch for the Rangers and then pitched poorly in the playoffs that fall. But in 2012, Uehara pitched well for the Rangers, posting a 1.75 ERA in 37 games. He signed with the Boston Red Sox this past offseason.Hunter, who is now 26, flopped as a starter last season, but he is starting to find a meaningful role in the bullpen. With a fastball that gets clocked in the upper 90s, he could become a nice asset there.And then there is Davis, who was obviously the steal of the deal. He batted .270 with 33 home runs and 85 RBIs last season. This season, the 27-year-old started with four home runs and 16 RBIs in his first four games, setting an all-time record. For that, he was named the American League Player of the Week last week.And to think, Davis might still be slugging in Texas if not for the two million bucks netted in the unremarkable Derrek Lee trade.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

Hardy followed with an RBI single.Already hampered by several key injuries, the Yankees pushed back Andy Pettitte\'s scheduled start Sunday in the finale of this three-game series to Tuesday or Wednesday because of back spasms. Phil Hughes, whose scheduled start Thursday was postponed by rain, will get the ball Saturday and Hiroki Kuroda will move back one day to Sunday.Too make matters worse for New York, Nunez, filling in at shortstop for injured captain Derek Jeter, was hit on his right wrist by a pitch from Miguel Gonzalez (1-1) and left after attempting a warmup throw before the third inning.X-rays were negative.Gonzalez dropped No. 9 hitter Francisco Cervelli to the dirt in the fifth with a pitch that came close to the catcher\'s head, and the right-hander was booed relentlessly by what remained of the 35,033 fans that withstood the blustery 35-degree wind chill.Cervelli ended up walking and coming around to score \xe2\x80\x94 clapping his hands \xe2\x80\x94 on Cano\'s RBI single to left-center, his eighth RBI in three games.""Miguel, I don\'t think he felt the baseball. He didn\'t really have a feel for his curveball most of the game,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""It was frustrating for him, but CC had a good outing, did a lot of things he\'s been doing for a long time. He\'s a pitcher. Miguel gave us a chance to win the game. We were fortunate not to give up more damage than we did.""NOTES: Gonzalez walked five. ... Jeter (ankle surgery) took batting practice on the field and grounders at the Yankees minor league complex in Tampa, Fla. He did a few slower-speed spin moves on balls up the middle. ... The Orioles claimed RHP Alex Burnett off waivers from Toronto and optioned him to Triple-A Rochester. To make room on the 40-man roster, they transferred INF Wilson Betemit (torn right knee ligament) from the 15- to the 60-day DL. ... Orioles RHP Steve Johnson (lat strain) and LHP Tsuyoshi Wada (elbow surgery) are to throw in extended spring training Saturday. ... Youkilis\' hitting streak is the longest to start a season for a player in his Yankees debut since Joe Buzzas had hits in the first 10 games of 1945, according to information provided by the Yankees from the Elias Sports Bureau.CONNECTTWEET                              1                      LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

Because we watched him in action last season, we already know what is the answer for Orioles Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations Dan Duquette. Claim him on waivers, send him to Norfolk, and hope you never need him. The player in question is Alex Burnett, who was designated for assignment by the Blue Jays when they claimed Towson University product Casper Wells. Burnett had been sent to the great DFA in the sky by the Twins at the end of spring training, so he\'s got to be feeling a little unwanted by now. Duquette wants him, though, at least for a little while. I wouldn\'t look into any long-term leases. Wilson Betemit has been transferred to the 60-day disabled list to make a spot on the 40-man roster. Sometimes, I can tell what is the rationale for these random roster moves based on the content of the press release the Orioles send out about them. For instance, when a lefty pitcher is claimed, they will often mention his splits against lefty batters. In the case of Burnett, here is what they said: he\'s 25 with a 4.61 ERA (170 IP, 87 ER) in 174 major league games with the Twins, has a 3.40 ERA (522 IP, 197 ER) in eight minor league seasons, mostly all with the Twins, and was a 12th round pick in 2005.    Should Duquette address the media about this claim, he\'ll probably string together some phrases from his book of stock phrases. Maybe a little something like this: ""Alex Burnett is a qualified major league pitcher, a dependable reliever with years of big league service who has excelled in retiring right-handed batters from the bullpen. We had the opportunity to add him to our organization and we believe he will provide depth to our ball club by pitching out of the Norfolk bullpen."" He may surprise us all and say something else, or he may say nothing at all, because all the beat reporters are on the road in New York and they don\'t have time to write about the latest random waiver claim in any sort of detail.

Maybe there were better times to ask Hughes about the strength of the division, times when he could have been more objective. But his perspective seemed to sum up the new reality of the American League East.\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen as much talent in the division as there is right now,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes said after the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 5-3 loss in the Bronx. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody seemed to improve from last year, bringing guys in from elsewhere. It seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s much more difficult lineups, top to bottom, with how balanced they are. Guys are coming off the bench that would be starting other places. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a very deep division.\xe2\x80\x9dThe start of the season has, for now, confirmed the general suspicion. The tattered Yankees and their collection of former stars have a .500 record after Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s loss. Every team in the division has four to six victories. The sample is so small that it might be meaningless, but it is all we have, and it indicates the possibility of a different kind of A.L. East.In the last 12 seasons, the division champions have averaged 98 victories and never had fewer than 95. This year, it seems, 90 wins might do it, even if the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 manager, Buck Showalter, disagrees. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      \xe2\x80\x9cI think that would be hard to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe think we have a corner on playing competitively in the A.L. East, but it\xe2\x80\x99s tough in the West, it\xe2\x80\x99s tough in the Central. You try to stay focused on your group, and you know that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to be around that 90 mark to be even in the hunt. I think that still holds true.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 Lyle Overbay, who played five seasons for Toronto, was cut by Boston this spring. Overbay said the new Red Sox manager, John Farrell, would help starters Jon Lester and Clay Buchholz, who are 4-0 in five starts. To Overbay, the pitching seems deeper in the division, and thus the teams are better.\xe2\x80\x9cIt used to be the Yankees and Red Sox, and then Tampa got into the mix,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Baltimore, and Toronto went out and made all those moves, too. There\xe2\x80\x99s not a weak team in this division. It\xe2\x80\x99s like playoff teams, consistently. There\xe2\x80\x99s no room for mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9dThe first major mistake of the regular season may have come Friday night at Kansas City, when Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Jose Reyes slid awkwardly into second base and severely sprained his ankle. The Blue Jays placed Reyes on the disabled list Saturday, and General Manager Alex Anthopoulos told Toronto reporters that Reyes would miss three months.

Credit             Dave Kaup/Reuters           The Blue Jays are still without third baseman Brett Lawrie because of a rib cage injury, and they called up shortstop Munenori Kawasaki from Class AAA to take Reyes\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the roster. They also have the veteran utility man Maicer Izturis, signed for three years and $10 million last winter, as insurance.

I expect they\xe2\x80\x99ll do just fine.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Even if Reyes were playing, he could do little to change the Blue Jays\xe2\x80\x99 biggest weakness. The rotation was supposed to be sturdy after adding R. A. Dickey, Mark Buehrle and Josh Johnson. But it started play Saturday with a 7.55 earned run average, by far the highest in the major leagues. The Blue Jays\xe2\x80\x99 best starter has been J. A. Happ, who replaced the former All-Star Ricky Romero when Romero was banished to the minors.

Privacy Policy    The Orioles have been a bit shaky, too, with a 4.79 starters\xe2\x80\x99 E.R.A., but they are into their third time through the rotation without making a change. That is significant for a team that churned through 12 starters last season, including only one who made more than 20 starts.The Orioles were due some good luck last season and got it with a 29-9 record in one-run games. As if to prove that such a pace was unsustainable, the Orioles lost their first three one-run games this season.But rotation stability \xe2\x80\x94 and the potential for a high-impact addition with the top prospect Dylan Bundy \xe2\x80\x94 is one reason to be optimistic about the Orioles. Another is a full season of Manny Machado, a 21-year-old third baseman.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Machado was the third overall pick in the 2010 draft, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 reward for losing 98 games under Dave Trembley the year before. A shortstop for all but two games in the minors, Machado deftly handled a position switch in the middle of a pennant race late last summer.\xe2\x80\x9cHe understood, when he came up here, that he was going to have some ups and downs,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he can always impact the game at third base, and he\xe2\x80\x99s done that.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Machado finished Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game by retiring Kevin Youkilis on a routine grounder, evening the series after the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 victory on Friday. The finale will play to a national audience Sunday night, suggesting that these two teams are the marquee entries in baseball\xe2\x80\x99s murkiest division. The reality is more complicated and could take a long time to reveal itself.

Take him ouuuuuut!\xe2\x80\x9d He was louder with each hard hit. Soon, a few others started to boo. By the fourth, as Hughes walked off the mound with his head bowed after being removed from the game, the crowd was more decided.\xe2\x80\x9cBoooooooo!\xe2\x80\x9d they let out, louder now, deeper, in unison.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m used to it \xe2\x80\x94 unfortunately,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes said after the Baltimore Orioles had pummeled him and beat the Yankees, 5-3. He let out a nervous laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something you deal with when you\xe2\x80\x99re not playing well.\xe2\x80\x9dHughes certainly did not pitch well. He allowed five runs, nine hits (including three home runs) and two walks in three-plus innings. The outing went so poorly that Manager Joe Girardi had to affirm Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s spot in the rotation, after his second start of the season.Before the game, Girardi said he wondered how sharp Hughes would be. He had pitched seven days ago, the long layoff the result of back-to-back postponements in Cleveland last week. In that start, the Tigers had battered him for four runs in four innings. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      If Hughes was going to lack polish Saturday, Girardi indicated it would show early on.On cue, Hughes allowed a leadoff double and issued two four-pitch walks in the first inning, but he escaped allowing just one run. In the second, he gave up a towering home run to Ryan Flaherty, who had struck out in 9 of his 18 at-bats this season.

Then Adam Jones singled, Chris Davis doubled, and two batters later, Jones scored.When Nolan Reimold, the No. 9 hitter, crushed another fastball for a home run to start the fourth, and Nate McLouth hit the next fastball for a double, Girardi made his way to the mound. Hughes was pulled, and he went back to the clubhouse to watch the rest of the game.On the field, Girardi called for David Phelps, and he proceeded to strike out four of the first five Orioles he faced. He was as effective and sharp as Hughes was not. Phelps lasted four innings, allowed one hit, a single, and struck out six.

The Twins defeated the Orioles 4 \xe2\x80\x93 3. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe 2013 season is officially 11 games old, with the Orioles standing at 6-5, and how many games have this California-based Orioles fan seen? Zero. I follow Orioles news on Twitter, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the heralds of Chris Davis after his amazing start, four homers in the first four games, but I also quickly see the bad news like Davis\xe2\x80\x99s error in game five and Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98s error in last night\xe2\x80\x99s loss to the Yankees. Because the Orioles got off to such a surprisingly hot start last season, they were all over the sporting news and that was music to my misplaced fan heart. I was able to reconnect with the team I\xe2\x80\x99d grown up rooting for, just now I was doing it from 3,000 miles away. This year, with the .500 start and the endless reports of PEDs (again) and the recent \xe2\x80\x9cbase-brawl\xe2\x80\x9d between the Dodgers & Padres, among other headlines, news about the Orioles hasn\xe2\x80\x99t popped up as often and I have suddenly encountered the conundrum that faces many sports fans; my team is doing well but I don\xe2\x80\x99t live near them anymore so I\xe2\x80\x99ve found myself out of the loop.March 30, 2013; Sarasota, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles catcher Matt Wieters (32) against the New York Mets at Ed Smith Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsI am certainly not the first person ever to face this dilemma. I moved from Baltimore when I was 12 because of my dad\xe2\x80\x99s job, but because it ended up being another 12 years until the Orioles had a winning record, I never felt like I was missing anything. It feels somewhat sacrilegious to say that, but the ups and downs of those 15 years left this Orioles fan a bit bruised, so my cheering had developed a healthy dose of skepticism. That being said, watching fans find their way back to Camden Yards last season as the team began to succeed again was amazing; it felt like the beginning of a new chapter, a really good chapter for a team like the Orioles with such a storied history.I know sports fans move cities for various reasons all the time, but living in California as a baseball fan means that I\xe2\x80\x99m in the minority and surrounded by lots of Giants, Padres, Athletics, Dodgers, & Angels. Whenever I turn on the TV, those are the uniforms I see along with names like Barry Zito, Matt Kemp & Albert Pujols. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fun experience to live in the city home to the most recent World Series champions, but they are not the team I cheer for, that\xe2\x80\x99s the Orioles. I want to see Adam Jones rob someone of a home run in center field, Matt Wieters\xc2\xa0throw out a runner at 2nd base with ease,\xc2\xa0Chris Davis clear the bases with one swing of his bat, and Jim Johnson strike out the side in the 9th inning. I\xe2\x80\x99m a recent college graduate, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not really in my budget to invest in MLB network, and I\xe2\x80\x99m on the phone during the day at work so much that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to justify paying to listen to the games on the radio because I probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do that anyway.March 25, 2013; Sarasota, FL, USA; Baltimore Orioles relief pitcher Jim Johnson (43) throws a pitch during the sixth inning against the Boston Red Sox at Ed Smith Stadium.

There\xe2\x80\x99s no use in complaining about it because I enjoy living in California AND I enjoy being an Orioles fan. I also root for the Ravens, so I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99ve been spoiled because their prolonged success, especially their recent Super Bowl victory, has kept them consistently in the public eye (and on national TV). The Orioles are just beginning their ascent back to success, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t happen overnight. Fans can see the ebbs & flows continuously throughout the season through social media outlets like Facebook, Twitter, & Vine, but there is something to be said for going to the stadium on a muggy summer night or sitting in front of the TV with friends watching a game, it feels timeless. This post may be coming at the completely wrong time since the Orioles are scheduled to play primetime Sunday Night Baseball tomorrow against the Yankees \xf0\x9f\x99\x82 but since the season is a marathon, not a sprint,\xc2\xa0I wanted to pose the question, what should I do?

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez)MoreNEW YORK (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 They\'ve heard the ""Who\'s on first jokes?"" They\'ve barely played together as a group. Still, there they were, the New York Yankees infield high-fiving and smiling with glee after having turned a most improbable triple play.""That was awesome,"" injured first baseman Mark Teixeira said Friday night after the Yankees\' 5-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. ""That\'s one of the toughest triple plays you\'ll ever see.""And how. For those scoring at home, mark it as a 4-6-5-6-5-3-4 in your books.Put names to the numbers and it won\'t be Derek Jeter at shortstop, Alex Rodriguez at third base or Teixeira at first. Jayson Nix, filling in for the fill-in shortstop, Kevin Youkilis at third base and Lyle Overbay on first completed the Yankees\' first triple play in the Bronx in 45 years.Baltimore started the eighth inning with singles by Alexi Casilla and Nick Markakis off CC Sabathia (2-1). Manny Machado then hit a sharp low liner that Robinson Cano caught on a short hop near second base. Cano threw to Nix, who entered in the third for Eduardo Nunez, at second for the forceout.Casilla, thinking the ball was going to be caught by Cano, got trapped in a rundown between second and third base.Youkilis tagged Casilla and made a quick throw to Overbay when Machado ranged too far off the bag. Overbay then made an awkward throw to Cano, who tagged Machado, setting off a celebration.""That\'s like being a kid again,"" Youkilis said. ""That\'s one of the coolest things I\'ve ever had on the field. You don\'t see one written up like that. It was special. This game we play, it\'s one of these games where it\'s a job and it\'s a grind at times. But when stuff like that happens, you feel like you\'re back playing Little League again.""Overbay, signed in late March to help fill in for Teixeira, was worried his throw to Cano was going to spoil the effort.""Good thing he\'s got good hand-eye coordination,"" Overbay said.The Yankees, who moved over .500 for the first time this year, had last turned a triple play on April 22, 2010, at Oakland \xe2\x80\x94 with Sabathia on the mound. They hadn\'t accomplished the feat in the Bronx since June 3, 1968, against Minnesota.The Orioles\' had not hit into a triple play since April 3, 1996, against Kanas City.""The two lead runners made the right play,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""It\'s a line drive short-hop. You can\'t go anywhere because if he catches it, then he does get multiple outs. We just made a mistake on the trail runner trying to get a little overaggressive, a young player.""Teixeira saw the team\'s hand specialist earlier Friday and was told he is not ready to start swinging a bat and needs to strengthen his injured wrist. But Teixeira said this is not a setback and he should be on target for a return near May 1. Jeter is rehabilitating his broken ankle in Florida and A-Rod is rehabbing from hip surgery and might not return until after the All-Star break.The Yankees got some help from Gold Glove center fielder Adam Jones in beating the Orioles.With the score 2-all in the seventh, the Yankees had loaded the bases on two walks \xe2\x80\x94 one intentional \xe2\x80\x94 and a hit batter. Vernon Wells, another late-March acquisition, hit a long fly ball that Jones ranged back for. On the warning track, Jones turned, raised his glove and blew a pink bubble. He closed his glove a bit early, and the ball bounced away as the bases cleared.""Just missed it,"" Jones said. ""You could say it\'s rain. You could say it\'s cold. You could say anything, wind, you could say whatever you want. I was there. Didn\'t catch it. Cost my team the game.""In the first meeting between the teams since the Yankees eliminated the Orioles in Game 5 of the division series, Sabathia allowed two runs \xe2\x80\x94 one earned \xe2\x80\x94 and eight hits with nine strikeouts and no walks. Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for his second save.Youkilis had three hits and an RBI but made an error at third base that led to the tying run in the seventh inning. Youkilis has hit in all nine games he\'s played with the Yankees.""Made an aggressive mistake,"" Youkilis said. ""You just don\'t want to give away outs.""Baltimore tied it 2-all when Matt Wieters reached on Youkilis\' misplay and advanced on Sabathia\'s balk. J.J. Hardy followed with an RBI single.Nunez was hit on his right wrist by a pitch from Miguel Gonzalez (1-1) and left after attempting a warmup throw before the third inning.X-rays were negative.Gonzalez dropped No. 9 hitter Francisco Cervelli to the dirt in the fifth with a pitch that came close to the catcher\'s head, and the right-hander was booed relentlessly by what remained of the 35,033 fans that withstood the blustery 35-degree wind chill.Cervelli ended up walking and coming around to score \xe2\x80\x94 clapping his hands \xe2\x80\x94 on Cano\'s RBI single to left-center, his eighth RBI in three games.NOTES: Gonzalez walked five. ... The Orioles claimed RHP Alex Burnett off waivers from Toronto and optioned him to Triple-A Rochester. To make room on the 40-man roster, they transferred INF Wilson Betemit (torn right knee ligament) from the 15- to the 60-day DL. ... Youkilis\' hitting streak is the longest to start a season for a player in his Yankees debut since Joe Buzzas had hits in the first 10 games of 1945, according to information provided by the Yankees from the Elias Sports Bureau.

Encina | The Baltimore SunI\xe2\x80\x99m currently on the Amtrak heading home from New York. I\xe2\x80\x99ve slept in my own bed for just two nights since Feb. 10, so heading back to Baltimore for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 nine-game homestand will be a welcome change.The Orioles played nine of their first 12 games on the road, opening the season in Tampa Bay before this week\xe2\x80\x99s road trip to Boston and New York. So they\xe2\x80\x99ve only been home for three games since the beginning of spring training.During the opening two weeks of the season, the Orioles have also played games at five different start times and played in three Opening Day games, which has prevented them from setting up any sense of routine after a spring training full of early afternoon games. var adSkipCounter = 0; \xe2\x80\x9cI think just from getting on a schedule and on a clock it\xe2\x80\x99s been a challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s been a challenge and with the WBC and all the things that have kind of been discombobulated with the schedule.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been proud with the way they\xe2\x80\x99ve handled it, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you\xe2\x80\x99re going to go home and play better or worse. It\xe2\x80\x99s more just getting your life in order a little bit. I think everybody is looking forward to some type of schedule if there\xe2\x80\x99s such a thing in baseball. I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear our guys complaining about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a part of the job description.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles come out of this stretch 6-6, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly great, but considering they earned series wins in Tampa Bay and Boston, it will do.But now that the Orioles come home to face the Rays, Dodgers and Blue Jays, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that everything is rosy. Keep in mind that last year\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles team flourished on the road, leading the American League with 46 wins away from Camden Yards.\xe2\x80\x9cOur guys would like to be 12-0,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd believe me, I know that sounds clich\xc3\xa9-ish. Does it mean that now everything\xe2\x80\x99s going to be OK and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to win all of our games at home? No, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything.\xe2\x80\x9dThe schedule doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get any easier following this homestand, as the Orioles head west for 11 games in 11 days in Seattle, Oakland and Anaheim that takes them through the first weekend in May.\xe2\x80\x9cI bet you can go into any clubhouse and they\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that there\xe2\x80\x99s some part of the schedule that\xe2\x80\x99s really challenging,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we get through with this, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to head out to the West Coast with no off day. What are you gonna do? Quit? It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the separators that\xe2\x80\x99s different about our game that any other one.\xe2\x80\x9d     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

', 'articles.baltimoresun.com'), (""A look at the baseball heroes of '42' on Jackie Robinson Day"", 'From left: Spider Jorgenson, Pee Wee Reese, Eddie Stanky and Jackie Robinson. (PHOTO: AP Photo)The themes of the new movie 42, a biopic about Robinson that dominated the weekend box office, extend beyond the baseball field upon which they largely take place.But because baseball \xe2\x80\x93 as noted early in the film \xe2\x80\x93 comes with exhaustive and ""democratic"" records of player performance, we can measure the on-field accomplishments of the players depicted as heroes in the movie even while appreciating their more important roles in integrating the game. So, with the help of baseball-reference.com, here\'s a look at the playing careers of the film\'s most notable good guys (or improved guys).Jackie Robinson: One of the first scenes of 42 shows Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey selecting Robinson\'s resume from a pile of scouting reports on Negro League players due to his age and attitude. But Rickey\'s scouting triumph in inviting Robinson to break baseball\'s color barrier is perhaps overlooked. At that point, obviously, there was no sure way to know how Negro League performance would translate to the Majors, or how baseball history \xe2\x80\x93 and for that matter, American history \xe2\x80\x93 would have changed if Robinson couldn\'t hack it in the big leagues. Luckily for all involved, he could: Though Robinson\'s role as a civil-rights pioneer obviously transcends his abilities on the field, he was an excellent ballplayer by any measure, a great contact hitter with some power and consistently great on-base percentages and by all accounts a good defender everywhere he played.Best season: Robinson won the NL MVP award in 1949 when he led the league in batting average and stolen bases. But he stood as one of the game\'s top players from 1949-1952, finishing in the Majors\' top 3 in Wins Above Replacement for four straight seasons.Career Wins Above Replacement: 61.4, despite not entering the big leagues until he was 28 years old.Awards and accolades: Robinson won the first-ever national Rookie of the Year award in 1947, and the prize has since been named in his honor. He won the NL MVP in 1949 and was an All-Star every season from 1949-1954. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1962.Fun fact: Though the number of times players were caught stealing was not officially tracked until 1951, four seasons after Robinson entered the league, Robinson stole bases at a great clip into his mid-30s. At age 34 in 1953, he led the Majors with a 80.95% stolen-base percentage.Pee Wee Reese: In the film, the popular Dodgers captain and Kentucky native contributed to Robinson\'s acceptance in the majors by putting his arm around his teammate in front of a harsh Cincinnati crowd \xe2\x80\x93 a moment enshrined in baseball legend and in a statue outside Brooklyn\'s MCU Park. Though Robinson and Reese became lifelong friends, the veracity of the specific gesture depicted in Cincinnati in 1947 has been questioned. In terms of on-field ability, Reese is the only player in 42 whose resume can match Robinson\'s. A great defensive shortstop, ""The Little Colonel"" racked up 2,170 hits over a 16-season career protracted by service in World War II.Best season: Reese was a steady performer throughout his career peak, but his 1947 stands out for his league-leading 104 walks and his career-high .414 on-base percentage.Career Wins Above Replacement: 66.2Awards and accolades: Reese made the All-Star team in 1942 then, after returning from service, every season from 1946-1954. He won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award for on- and off-field character in 1956, and was elected to the Hall of Fame by the Veterans\' Committee in 1984.Fun fact: Reese started as a minor leaguer for the Red Sox, but was traded to the Dodgers in 1939 due in part to negative scouting reports from then-Red Sox shortstop/manager Joe Cronin.Hamish Linklater as Ralph Branca and Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson in 42. (PHOTO: Warner Bros.)Ralph Branca: The movie shows Branca as one of the few Dodgers supportive of Robinson from the start, but Branca is perhaps best known as the pitcher who served up Bobby Thomson\'s ""Shot Heard \'Round the World"" home run to give the Giants the National League pennant over the Dodgers in 1951. Branca was only 21 years old when he lined up next to Robinson on opening day in 1947 but had spent parts of the prior three seasons in the Majors with the Dodgers.Best season: Branca was the Dodgers\' best pitcher in 1947, going 21-12 with a 2.67 ERA over 280 innings and earning his first All-Star nod.Career Wins Above Replacement: 16.3Awards and accolades: Branca made National League All-Star teams in 1947, 1948 and 1949.Fun fact: Branca, who lives in Rye, N.Y., is the only surviving member of the 1947 Dodgers. Though raised Catholic, in 2011 Branca learned from a New York Times reporter that his mother was Jewish, a fact she kept secret while raising him and his 16 siblings to be tolerant of all races and religions.Eddie Stanky: The blond-haired, blue-eyed movie version of Stanky steals a scene in 42 when he confronts opposing Philadelphia\'s explicit, racist manager, Ben Chapman \xe2\x80\x93 his former teammate. Stanky, whose presence at second base for the Dodgers forced Robinson to learn first, was perhaps the most patient hitter of his era. In a time before on-base percentage was widely appreciated as valuable, Stanky led the league in walks in 1945, 1946 and 1950, and \xe2\x80\x93 not surprisingly \xe2\x80\x93 finished among the league leaders in runs scored in all of those seasons.Best season: Reunited with former Brooklyn manager Leo Durocher on the New York Giants in 1950, Durocher posted a career-best .460 on-base percentage and finished third in MVP balloting.Career Wins Above Replacement: 39.3.Awards and accolades: Stanky made All-Star teams in 1947, 1948 and 1950.Fun fact: Durocher loved Stanky. In singing Stanky\'s praises, Durocher said, ""nice guys finish last"" -- a quote used both in the film and as the title of Durocher\'s autobiography.Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson in 1949. (PHOTO: Dan Gunther/Getty Images Archive)Branch Rickey: The film gives credit to Rickey, appropriately, for signing Robinson and helping to end baseball\'s tradition of segregation. Not shown (and less important, obviously): 1947 also marked the first year Rickey employed a statistical analyst, and decades before the events depicted in Moneyball, Rickey sung the praises of players who got on base. The 1947 Dodgers, with patient hitters like Robinson, Reese and Stanky, led the Majors in on-base percentage by a wide margin.Best season: Rickey served as a decent catcher for the St. Louis Browns in 1906, but his work as a player and later as a manager pales in comparison to his years as a pioneering executive. So it\'s 1947, the pennant-winning and revolutionary season depicted in the movie.Career Wins Above Replacement: Not really applicable, but 1.1.Awards and accolades: Rickey was elected into the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1967.Fun fact: New York-based sportswriter Tom Meany nicknamed Rickey ""The Mahatma"" after reading a description of Mohandas Ghandi that called the leader of the Indian independence movement ""an incredible combination of Jesus Christ, Tammany Hall and your father."" But New York Daily News sportswriter Jimmy Powers called Rickey ""El Cheapo.""Bobby Bragan: Bragan\'s role as an initially hesitant but ultimately accepting Dodger gets his character screen time in 42 that belies the 36 total at-bats he got for Brooklyn in 1947. After only a handful of appearances in 1948, Bragan was released in favor of African-American catcher and future Hall of Famer Ralph Campanella and accepted a job managing the Dodgers\' minor league team in Fort Worth. He went on to a long career as a minor league manager and executive.Best season: Bragan never hit much, but he served as the Phillies\' everyday shortstop and had his best offensive season as a 23-year-old in 1941.Career Wins Above Replacement: 0.9Awards and accolades: Bragan was inducted into state sports Hall of Fames in his native Alabama and in Texas, where he worked for the bulk of his minor league career.Fun fact: Bragan came out of retirement in 2005 to manage the independent Fort Worth Cats for one game and become, at 87, the oldest manager in professional baseball history. He was ejected in the third inning for arguing with an umpire.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInJackie Robinson Day around MLB\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Tuesday, 16 April: Jake Arrieta vs. Roberto Hernandez    Career Numbers Arrieta vs. Rays Hernandez vs. O\'s   IP 33.2 84.0   ERA 5.88 3.64   FIP 5.29 4.52   Slash Line (Past Teams) .234/.333/.419 .280/.347/.441   Slash Line (Current Players) .281/.373/.469 .272/.312/.417     The Orioles managed to beat Hernandez last time they met, but that wasn\'t with Arrieta pitching for them. Arrieta has struggled with command and therefore efficiency in both of his starts this year, lasting only five innings in each. Perhaps he\'ll take a step forward today and save the bullpen an inning or two, but if not, at least the offense may pick up the slack. Hernandez hasn\'t been great this year, either, allowing ten runs (nine earned) in 13.1 IP, so look for the bats to decide this game. Maybe hot: Chris Davis (1.198 OPS, 14 PA); Matt Joyce (1.217 OPS, 15 PA), Yunel Escobar (1.063 PA, 17 PA)    Likely not: Nick Markakis (.591 OPS, 26 PA) Wednesday, 17 April: Chris Tillman vs. Matt Moore    Career Numbers Tillman vs. Rays Moore vs. O\'s   IP 37.2 21.0   ERA 4.78 2.57   FIP 6.36 4.71   Slash Line (Past Teams) .243/.329/.529 .279/.374/.430   Slash Line (Current Players) .257/.366/.586 .321/.406/.500        If you put any stock in small pitcher-vs.-team sample sizes, this looks to be a another slugfest. Tillman has allowed nine home runs and 17 walks in 37.2 innings against the Rays, while Moore has allowed three homers and 13 walks in his 21 innings. Of course, Moore has allowed three hits and zero runs this year, while Tillman\'s given up seven runs in nine innings across two starts. Moore did stuggle with his control last time out, walking six Rangers, so there\'s some reason to hope there, but like Arrieta, Tillman needs to get more pitch-efficient to avoid overworking the O\'s bullpen. Maybe hot: Matt Wieters (2.102 OPS, 2 HR in 11 PA); Evan Longoria (1.850 OPS, 3 HR in 15 PA)    Thursday, 18 April: Miguel Gonzalez vs. David Price    Career Numbers Gonzalez vs. Rays Price vs. O\'s   IP 28.1 87.1   ERA 3.49 2.27   FIP 4.90 2.69   Slash Line (Past Teams) .220/.339/.330 .214/.268/.300   Slash Line (Current Players) .200/.304/.313 .230/.276/.326     Didn\'t we just leave this party? Yes, the O\'s get to face David Price again. At least we won\'t have to hear about how no Oriole has homered off of him this time, since Matt Wieters did on 2 April--apparently Reynolds\'s two HR in one game in 2011 didn\'t count. Gonzalez did pretty well against the Rays last time out (6.1 IP, 2 R, 5 H, 2 BB, 4 K), but struggled with control in his last start in New York. He\'ll need to regain that to give the O\'s a shot at winning this one. Maybe hot: Matt Wieters (.892 OPS, 32 PA) Likely not: Nolan Reimold (.351 OPS, 24 PA) Weaver\'s Third Law: The easiest way around the bases is with one swing of the bat.

04/17/2013,"[('Orioles 2, Rays 6: Crapfest? Crapfest. - Camden Chat', "" The Orioles played a pretty lousy game tonight. They didn't hit, they didn't pitch, they didn't field. Sometimes you can get away with not doing one of those things, every now and then you can get away with not doing two of those things. But generally if you do none of them, you're gonna lose. So, what went right tonight? Well...Adam Jones hit his second homer of the year. The Orioles took five walks. Tommy Hunter didn't look too bad. That's a pretty short and uninspiring list, but there you go. Now onto the bad. Chris Tillman was a big old mess. He only walked two but he threw so many pitches and went to a three-ball count on too many hitters. He got knocked around for four runs in five innings and gave up two home runs, one each in the first two innings. He threw 93 pitches in five innings and continued the trend of O's starters not going deep in the game. Tillman was replaced by T.J. McFarland, and for those of you calling for him to replace either Tillman or Jake Arrieta in the lineup, tonight wasn't a very good audition. He pitched 2 1/3 innings in relief and gave up two more runs to the Rays.    You won't see it in the boxscore, because it somehow got ruled a double, but Adam Jones made an awful play in center field that allowed two runs to score. On a shallow fly ball to center by James Loney, Jones made the bad decision to try and catch a ball that he wasn't nearly close enough on. When he couldn't make the catch he tried to play it on a bounce but he was too close and it went past him. If he had played it as a single then one run would have scored anyway, but it was really ugly. As I said before, the Orioles did draw five walks on the night, three of which were off of starter Matt Moore, who also gave up five hits. Still, the O's only scored on the homer by Jones, thanks in part to seven strikeouts against Moore. They couldn't do much against the Rays bullpen, getting one hit and two walks over the final 2 1/3 innings. Tomorrow the Orioles have yet another rubber game and turn to Miguel Gonzalez to right the ship. Of course, the bats will also need to wake up, and with David Price on the mound that's a pretty tall order.     "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Joe Flacco, Chris Johnson and Ryan Clady highlight the list of players who surely would\'ve fared better for Gang Green.\xc2\xa0                                      Jeff Zelevansky, Getty ImagesFullscreen                                     8. 1991 QBs: Brett Favre was a second-round selection in \'91. The guys who went in Round 1 instead? Dan McGwire (No. 16) and Todd Marinovich (No. 24), who combined for 2,090 career passing yards \xe2\x80\xa6 or about half a season for Favre.\xc2\xa0                                      Reed Saxon, APFullscreen                                     9. Russell Erxleben, P, Saints (No. 11, 1979): If you\'re going to take a punter in the first round, he better be Ray Guy. Erxleben wasn\'t. Little wonder the Saints, who passed on Kellen Winslow (not to mention Joe Montana), were a laughingstock for decades.\xc2\xa0                                      Michael Zagaris, Getty ImagesFullscreen                                     10. Aundray Bruce, OLB, Falcons (No. 1, 1988): Atlanta thought it was getting the next Lawrence Taylor. Instead, the Falcons got 16 sacks in four seasons before Bruce floundered with the Raiders (who tried converting him to tight end) for seven more. Among the 10 guys taken after Bruce were Neil Smith, Tim Brown, Sterling Sharpe and Michael Irvin.\xc2\xa0                                      Otto Greule Jr, Getty ImagesFullscreen                                     11.

Johnny ""Lam"" Jones, WR, Jets (No. 2, 1980): New York traded two first-round picks to get the Texas sprinter. He averaged fewer than 30 catches and 500 yards during his five NFL seasons. Elsewhere, Anthony Munoz, taken one spot after Jones, became arguably the league\'s best all-time tackle while Art Monk had a record-setting career for the Redskins.\xc2\xa0                                      Joe Giza, APFullscreen                                     13.

Didn\'t happen. Donovan McNabb (picked No. 2) had a solid career and Daunte Culpepper (11th) was on his way before ripping up a knee.

Spurrier finished with 40 TD passes and 60 INTs in 10 seasons. The No. 4 pick in 1967 was Hall of Fame QB Bob Griese, who was followed two spots later by Canton RB Floyd Little.\xc2\xa0                                      RD, APFullscreen                                     28. Colts defenders: Indianapolis owned the top two picks in 1992 and came away with defensive tackle Steve Emtman and linebacker Quentin Coryatt, who combined for zero Pro Bowl nods. Emtman\'s career was derailed by injuries, while Coryatt never emerged as the playmaker the Colts envisioned. Linebacker Trev Albert got the call at No. 5 in 1994, but elbow problems limited him to 29 games.\xc2\xa0                                      Tom Strickland, APFullscreen                                     29.

04/19/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles Insider Brittany Ghiroli Talks Early ...', '  Brittany Ghiroli ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), ('Orioles 10, Rays 6: A walk off cures all ills - Camden Chat', "" If there is one word I'd use to describe this game between the Baltimore Orioles and Tampa Bay Rays, that word is bananas. It was a back and forth affair on the scoreboard as the Orioles again got to David Price and as Miguel Gonzalez just wasn't as good as we hoped. It featured Steve Pearce, who was 0-for-13 coming into the season, hitting a go ahead run. And it had Darren O'Day, normally as steady as can be, giving up a homer to a guy who is very bad at hitting baseballs. And in the end, it had a walk off grand slam from Matt Wieters to secure the 10-6 victory.  The first inning was not good to Miguel Gonzalez, as the suddenly homer happy Rays hung two runs on him via two solo homers. Both were hit by players who already had homered in the series: Evan Longoria and Desmond Jennings. It put Gonzalez in an early hole, and after David Price struck out the side to start his game, the Rays tacked on another solo run in the second to take a 3-0 lead.  The second inning was a tough one for Gonzalez. He struck out Shelley Duncan for the first out, but then loaded the bases on two singles and a hit by pitch. Jennings hit a long fly ball out to left field to drive in a run, and with one base again open, Gonzalez walked Kelly Johnson to re-load them. A pep talk from Rick Adair seemed to help him, though, and he retired Ben Zobrist to end the inning.  Wieters had the first at bat of a very big night in the second inning and hit a double in to the right field corner. Chris Davis, who looked better at the plate today, drove Wieters in with a single, and three batters later Nolan Reimold hit his second home run of the year to tie the game at three.     Just as soon as the Orioles dug themselves out of the hole, Gonzalez put them right back in. Well, J.J. Hardy might also have had something to do with it. With one out, Matt Joyce singled and Gonzalez walked Shelley Duncan, which is inexcusable. James Loney then hit a ground ball to Davis at first. Davis went to second for one out and the return throw from Hardy sailed away from Gonzalez, who was covering. Joyce scored on the play to make the score 4-3. The error was on Hardy, but the walk of Duncan was on Gonzalez.     Both pitchers then settled down for several innings, then in the bottom of the fifth the O's got one back. With two outs, Alexi Casilla doubled, then Nick Markakis hit a ground ball to short stop. Yunel Escobar threw high and Markakis dove into first to avoid the tag. That's one of the only times a slide at first makes sense. Manny Machado stepped to the plate and drove a ball to deep left field. It bounced off the wall and while Casilla scored easily, a late stop sign by the third base coach left Markakis too far off the base. He stopped halfway to home and was thrown out.  It was a brand new ball game, though, as the score was tied. Unfortunately it got untied in the top of the sixth thanks to a homer from Jose Molina. When back-to-back singles followed that, Gonzalez's day was over. It was not a good day. Brian Matusz came in to pitch and was fantastic. He got the last out of the inning and then pitched a perfect seventh, preserving the tie until the O's offense could fire up another rally.     That rally came in the bottom of the seventh from two unlikely sources. Hardy, who has looked putrid at the plate so far this season, doubled to right center field. I happened to be listening on the radio at the time and Joe Angel and Fred Manfra were debating the idea of having the next batter, Steve Pearce, bunt. I thought it was a bad idea since Hardy was already in scoring position, and the Orioles agree. Pearce worked relief pitcher Jake McGee to a 3-2 count and then crushed a fastball to left field. It was a no doubter and it gave the O's a 6-5 lead. Not a bad way to get your first hit of the season (although I imagine Pearce wishes it had come a lot sooner).  With a one-run lead, all the Orioles had to do was send Darren O'Day out for the eighth, then Jim Johnson for the ninth, and it'd be over, right? Wrong. At some point tonight we slipped into bizarro world. I wasn't sure when Pearce homered, but when Darren O'Day gave up a homer to James Loney, I knew I had to be watching Orioles baseball in some kind of alternate universe. The homer tied the game 6-6, which is where it would stay until the bottom of the tenth.  Three straight singles by Markakis, Machado, and Jones loaded the bases to start the ninth. If you were just looking at a box score, that might sound about normal if one or more of the singles was of the infield variety or hit sharply to the left fielder to keep the runner from scoring, etc. But that's not exactly what happened. With Markakis on second and Machado on first, Adam Jones hit a ball to deep right field. It looked like a walk off hit, but Markakis held up at second in case it was caught. By the time he got to running, it was too late and he had to stop at third. Manny stood in the baseline just between second and third base and Jones almost passed him.

Pearce was 0-for-15 on the season, and Reimold was struggling to stay above the Mendoza Line. As we know, Pearce recorded his first hit on the year that night (a homer at that), and Reimold provided a key home run. Fast forward to this afternoon in the first game of a twin bill against the LA Dodgers; Reimold provided a key homer to get the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense going after being down 4-0, and later the eventual winning runs with an RBI-double in the last of the eighth. Pearce gave the Orioles a short-lived lead with a two-RBI single as well. Many people questioned these guys\xe2\x80\x99 continued presence on the roster, however we need to realize that baseball\xe2\x80\x99s much more of a grind than any other sport. Furthermore, you\xe2\x80\x99re never more than one at-bat away from breaking out of a slump.Jason Hammel provided an \xe2\x80\x9cinteresting\xe2\x80\x9d start to say the least. In the first game of a twin bill the last thing you want is for your starter to struggle. Hammel became the fourth pitcher in as many games to give up a home run in the first inning for the Orioles. This time it was a damaging one, as Andre Ethier sent a three-run shot onto Eutaw St. However the good news is that Hammel settled down. His final line: 6 IP, 8 H, 5 R, 23BB, 5 K. After driving the score to 4-0, Hammel appeared to be a new pitcher for the Orioles. This was most evident when Buck Showalter sent him back out to pitch the sixth, already bordering on 100 pitches. Hammel got through the inning in nine pitches, which potentially saved the Orioles from having to use an extra reliever.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsChris Davis led off the last of the second with a base hit, which was followed up with a J.J. Hardy two-run homer. Los Angeles had been leading 4-0, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where you could start to see the game change a bit. Nolan Reimold brought the Orioles to within one at 4-3 with a solo homer in the fourth. Hardy struck again in the sixth with a sac fly that tied the game. Pearce then singled Chris Davis home, and the Orioles suddenly had the lead. When the Orioles turned around and switched pitchers, Jason Hammel was in line to win the game which would have surprised anyone that watched only the first inning.Unfortunately Pedro Strop had a conflict of confidence when he came in to relieve Hammel, and he allowed Mark Ellis to score on a wild pitch. However part of Orioles baseball of late has been picking up your teammates, and Brian Matusz and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day shut down Los Angeles in the seventh and eighth. With one out in the last of the eighth Chris Davis missed a home run by about two inches, however he represented the go-ahead run at second base. Following a J.J. Hardy walk, both Hardy and Davis advanced into scoring position on a catchers\xe2\x80\x99 passed ball. \xc2\xa0That brought Reimold to the plate following an IBB of pinch-hitter Nate McLouth. Reimold pulled a tight liner down the right field line for a two-RBI double, and the Orioles took the opener 7-5.Steve Pearce had too good of a spring not to be in the big leagues with the Orioles right now, and while he had a difficult start he\xe2\x80\x99s paying dividends now. Baseball is a game that will humble you to no end, however it also provides guys with redemption if they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to scuffle for it. The concern coming out of the game is that the bullpen was probably used a bit more than Buck Showalter and Rick Adair would have liked, however that\xe2\x80\x99s part of a doubleheader. The haven\xe2\x80\x99t made any roster moves prior to game two, so while the bullpen did take a bit of a hit in game one at the very least they appear to be comfortable with where the pen is going into game two. That isn\xe2\x80\x99t to say that Wei-Yin Chen couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to go deep into the game however. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('RECAP: Orioles 6, Dodgers 1: So this is what good baseball ...', ' Orioles fans could be forgiven if they had forgotten entirely that winning a baseball game sometimes doesn\'t require saying ""A win is a win, but...""  As the team has hovered just above .500 for most of the young season, just about every win has had such a qualifier attached.  If it hasn\'t been the starting pitching (and it usually has), it\'s been the defense, a barely satisfactory offense or a bullpen living on the razor\'s edge (Darren O\'Day and Jim Johnson excluded).  Tonight was no such night, as the Orioles decisively defeated the Dodgers to complete a sweep of a two-game doubleheader, and head into Sunday\'s play with hopes of their first series sweep of 2013 as well. Wei-Yin Chen did not break the Orioles starters of their inability to get past the sixth inning, but he did acquit himself well against a potent-on-paper Dodgers offense, which continued to struggle against Chen as they have everyone else to start the season.  Chen looked like he might make it a long game after the first inning, a lengthy effort that ended with just one run - Carl Crawford plated by an Adrian Gonzalez sac fly - but looked a lot worse when there were Dodgers on first and third with nobody out.  After he pitched out of that spot of trouble, Chen put things in cruise control for five more innings, allowing a smattering of base hits and walks, but no extra-base hits and very few meaningful scoring threats. The Orioles, for their part, took some time to find their offensive stride against Dodgers starter Josh Beckett, but eventually managed to put the game in the bag, tagging Beckett for six unanswered earned runs.  Chris Davis evened things at 1-1 in the 2nd inning with a mammoth solo home run to dead center, which, Gary Thorne would later inform viewers, was the third-longest shot by an Oriole at Camden Yards.  Ever.  The score stuck at 1-1 until the fifth inning, most frustratingly through a two-out rally in the third, in which Nate McLouth, Manny Machado and Nick Markakis loaded the bases before Adam Jones grounded out weakly on a pitch well outside of the strike zone. But if Orioles fans were thinking that murdered rally portended another night of offensive futility in support of a sturdy outing from Chen, they needed merely stay tuned for the fifth inning, when Beckett suddenly came off the rails, allowing a walk to McLouth after a hard-fought at-bat.  McLouth stole second and advanced to third on a throw that sailed into center field, and Machado promptly plated him with a double lashed to left field.  Jones came up looking for redemption, and clubbed a double to left-center that barely made it out of Crawford\'s glove (but also barely fell short of a home run), and scored Machado easily.  Suddenly the Orioles found themselves up 3-1.    Chen cruised through the top of the sixth before the Orioles spotted him the kind of lead he hadn\'t seen since mid-season 2012.  Back-to-back singles by Ryan Flaherty (really!) and McLouth came quickly before Machado served up an Earl Weaver special (appropriate, since Earl was honored by current and former Orioles legends prior to the game) and gave the Orioles a 6-1 lead they wouldn\'t relinquish. As much as Orioles fans would have loved to see a starter go deep (especially on the back half of a doubleheader), Buck Showalter wisely decided to yank Chen for the seventh inning, opting for Tommy Hunter, who took full advantage of the five-run lead to comfortably record the last nine outs of the ballgame and preserve the rest of the bullpen, with the Dodgers continuing to scatter baserunners but still failing to record an extra-base hit. So this is what it looks like to get a solid starting pitching performance, good offensive output and no fatal defensive miscues.  The 2013 Orioles can do it after all.

Happ, entered with 7.07 and 5.04 ERAs, respectively. So naturally they engaged in a serious pitching duel that held both teams scoreless until the bottom of the sixth inning. Thankfully the Orioles pulled out the win thanks to a two-out, two-strike, walk-off single by Nick Markakis. To say that Tillman hasn't been good this year is being kind. Coming into this game he pitched just 14 innings over his first three starts and in none of them did he look like he was in control of the game. Tonight it was like he was a different person, and it couldn't have come at a better time. Tillman got three quick groundouts to start the game, then after giving up a single and walk in the top of the second, he induced a ground ball double play from Colby Rasmus. Starting with Rasmus, Tillman retired seven in a row before walking the leadoff hitter in the fifth inning. But he faced just three batters in the inning thanks to another double play by Rasmus. He pitched another scoreless inning in sixth before the Blue Jays finally scored a run in the seventh. But before we get to that, let's talk about the other pitcher. J.A. Happ has, like Tillman, had his troubles this season. But you wouldn't know it from tonight's game. Nick Markakis led off the game with a single to center field, and that was the last hit the Orioles would have off of Happ until there were two outs in the bottom of the fifth when Alexi Casilla reached on an infield hit to third base. The only chance that the Orioles had for a rally was in the second inning when Happ walked J.J. Hardy and then hit Steve Pearce with one out. Unfortunately the Orioles couldn't do anything with the chance as Nolan Reimold and Casilla stranded the runners.    That bring us to the bottom of the sixth inning, when something FINALLY happened. Don't get your hopes up though; it wasn't much. Manny Machado led off the inning with a single, then Adam Jones hit a ball hard towards third base. Brett Lawrie dove and the ball hit off of his glove for a single. Both runners moved up on a wild pitch by Happ, but Matt Wieters couldn't knock them in. He hit the ball hard, but right to the shortstop, and the runners had to hold.    Chris Davis came to the plate looking to plate a few runs, and he hit a ball that looked crushed off the bat. But between the cold weather and the wind blowing in, nothing was getting out of the ballpark tonight. Davis had to settle for a sacrifice fly to right field to give the O's a 1-0 lead. It was the second ball of the night hit by Davis that probably would have been a home run in different weather. Jones moved to third base on the sacrifice, but Hardy was unable to knock him in. He grounded out to third base and the Orioles handed Tillman the slimmest of leads. Spoiler: the lead didn't hold.    Tillman struck out Jose Bautista to start the seventh inning, then gave up a solid single to Edwin Encarnacion. He then struck out Adam Lind and just had to get one more out to be the first Orioles starter to pitch seven innings in a game. The Orioles employed a shift against J.P. Arencibia that left the right side almost completely wide open. Tillman got a ground ball but unfortunately it went right to where the second baseman would normally be standing and into right field for a single. Encarnacion went to second base and Rasmus stepped to the plate. Rasmus had already hit into two double plays in the game and is generally not a very good hitter, but he got lucky. Tillman threw him a pretty good pitch and Rasmus chopped it to the right side. It just barely got through the infielders for a hit. Blargh! Encarnacion scored and the game was tied. In a different circumstance, Buck Showalter probably would have left Tillman out there to get the final out. But in such a tight game and with runners on base, he had little choice but to pull him. Darren O'Day replaced him and wasn't at his best. But as I've said before, a not-at-his-best O'Day is still pretty good. He walked Brett Lawrie to load the bases but then struck out Emilio Bonifacio to end the inning. It looked like the Orioles might get something cooking when Happ walked Steve Pearce to start the seventh inning. Happ was immediately replaced by Steve Delabar, who got Reimold to ground into a double play. Curses! Casilla struck out to end the inning and that was that. O'Day came back out to pitch the eighth inning and immediately walked Munenori Kawasaki. Maybe the cold was affecting him, I don't know. Kawasaki is not the kind of guy you normally walk. But O'Day struck back and got the next three batters to preserve the tie. Machado tried to start a rally on his own in the bottom of the eighth. He walked with one out and stole second base, but unfortunately Jones struck out for the second out. That left the rally up to Wieters, who sadly struck out. With no chance for a save situation, Jim Johnson came in to pitch the top of the ninth and was his regular JJ self. A fly ball out for Lind, a strikeout of Arencibia, and a groundball to first base for Rasmus made for a quick top of the ninth. Chris Davis was the first batter in the bottom of the ninth inning and the crowd was itching for a walkoff home run. He'd already been denied twice by the wind and cold, but if anyone in the park tonight could overcome those obstacles, it was Chris Davis. But he didn't even get a chance as the first pitch from Aaron Loup hit him. The crowd booed as Davis took his base. Hardy was up next and he bunted Davis over to second base. I know there are a lot of conflicting feelings about bunts, but given Hardy's inability to get on base, it's understandable. Of course, on the flip side is the fact that the next batter after Hardy was Steve Pearce, who hasn't had much success this year. Sure enough, Pearce popped up for the second out. So much for the bunt. With two outs and the winning run on second, the Blue Jays opted to intentionally walk Reimold to get to Casilla. Give that Loup is a lefty, the move made sense. The only righty on the bench was Taylor Teagarden, and they wouldn't use him. It worked, too. Casilla hit a ground ball to the shortstop Kawasaki, and it looked like extra innings were in the future. But wait! Kawasaki made a bad throw! It skipped away from Encarnacion at first base and everyone was safe! The Orioles had been given an extra chance. Specifically, Nick Markakis got the chance. He watched two strikes to go down 0-2, then fouled off a pitch. In the fourth pitch of the at-bat, Markakis hit a decent pitch the opposite way. Would it stay fair? It did! Davis came in to score the winning run as the Orioles mobbed Markakis at first. Gotta love a walk off! Tomorrow the Orioles will be back in action at 7:05 as Miguel Gonzalez will do his best to outduel R.A. Dickey.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
04/23/2013,"[('Orioles 4, Blue Jays 3: Miguel Gonzalez and Manny \\u2026', ' The Orioles secured their fifth series win of the season tonight with a 4-3 victory over R.A. Dickey and the Toronto Blue Jays. They got a good start from Miguel Gonzalez (although he did not reach the promised land of 7 IP) and got to Dickey for four runs in the second inning to get just enough runs for the win. Gonzalez picked up where Chris Tillman left off last night, and I gotta say, it\'s much easier to be a baseball fan when your team has effective starting pitching. Gonzalez retired the first six batters he faced, throwing just 23 pitches through the first two innings. Gonzalez\'s counterpart, Dickey, wasn\'t as good. The last time the Orioles faced him, Dickey pitched a complete game against them with just one hit and thirteen strikeouts. Honestly, I expected more of the same tonight, despite Dickey\'s slow start to the 2013 season. Happily, I was wrong. The Orioles started the second inning with three consecutive singles by Adam Jones, Chris Davis, and Matt Wieters. The last one resulted in a run to give the Orioles the lead, and they weren\'t finished. J.J. Hardy popped up for the first out, then Dickey walked Ryan Flaherty to load the bases. Nolan Reimold hit a ball to left center that didn\'t have enough oomph to get out of the park, but it did allow Chris Davis to tag up and score the O\'s second run of the night.    Dickey\'s pitches were all over the place and he issued his second walk of the inning to Nate McLouth, which reloaded the bases and brought Manny Machado to the plate. Manny sent the first pitch he saw back up the middle, just out of reach of the shortstop Munenori Kawasaki. Wieters and Flaherty raced home (well, as much as Wieters can race) with the third and fourth runs of the inning. Markakis grounded out to end things, but it was a great inning for the O\'s. And as it turns out, it was the only offense they\'d muster on the entire night.    Armed with a four-run lead, Gonzalez went back to work. He got out of trouble in both the third and fourth innings thanks to a double play in each, then pitched a great 1-2-3 fifth inning. The Orioles tried to rally in the fifth inning thanks to a one-out double by Machado, his second hit of the night, and a walk by Markakis. But neither Jones nor Davis could capitalize on the opportunity, and just one inning later it looked like it might come back to haunt them.    Gonzalez got two quick outs to start the sixth inning, but then things fell apart in a hurry. He walked Adam Lind and Jose Bautista. That prompted a visit from pitching coach Rick Adair. I don\'t know what he said out there, but I\'m willing to bet it wasn\'t, ""Throw a first pitch fastball that Edwin Encarnacion can smoke for a three-run homer,"" but that\'s what Gonzalez did after Adair returned to the dugout. Oops. Up by just one run at that point, Gonzalez gave up a long hit to Melky Cabrera. Adam Jones raced back towards the wall with Markakis coming over to back up. Jones leaped but couldn\'t get to the ball and it took a weird hop then kicked off of Jones\' leg or foot and squirted away from both players. It looked like Cabrera might be on his way to an inside-the-park homer, but he ran out of gas at third base and was held. It was lucky that he did, because a faster runner would have scored easily. Gonzalez got Brett Lawrie to line out for the third out and strand Cabrera, and the O\'s found themselves playing in another close game. The Orioles hitters weren\'t able to add on any more runs, so once again it was down to the bullpen to hold a slim lead. Brian Matusz pitched the seventh inning and looked fantastic, but was taken out after walking the leadoff batter in the eighth. When Rajai Davis was announced as a pinch hitter for Lind, Buck Showalter went to Pedro Strop. And as is often the case with Strop, it was an adventure. Rajai Davis bunted DeRosa over to second base for the first out, then Jose Bautista grounded out to shortstop with DeRosa going to third. Strop then walked Encarnacion, and he either completely lost the strike zone or was pitching around Encarnacion. I\'d believe either. But then he went 2-0 on Cabrera and things got scary. He worked the count full on Melky, then threw a pitch that was very close to the strike zone, but according to PitchFX, just barely a ball. Cabrera started towards first as the home plate umpire rung him up. Lucky break for the O\'s. With that, the Orioles just needed Jim Johnson to shut things down. Mr. Reliable was filthy tonight, despite giving up a two-out single to Maicer Izturis. He ended the game with a fantastic strikeout of J.P. Arencibia, sealing the win and clinching another series victory. Tomorrow the Orioles will go for the sweep with spot starter Josh Stinson facing Brandon Morrow.

Dickey in 4-3 win over Blue JaysApril 23, 2013|By Eduardo A. Encina | The Baltimore SunThe last time the Orioles faced knuckleballer R.A. Dickey, they were mystified by pitches with so little spin that you could nearly make out Bud Selig\'s signature on the baseball.But Tuesday, the Orioles figured out the reigning National League Cy Young Award winner at Camden Yards in their first meeting against him as a member of the bolstered Toronto Blue Jays.The Orioles batted around in a four-run second inning against Dickey, slapping his fluttering knuckleball around the holes in Toronto\'s infield, and then held on for a 4-3 win. var adSkipCounter = 0; Almost as impressive was how the Orioles bullpen closed out another late-inning, one-run lead for the team\'s 100th consecutive regular season win when leading after the completion of the seventh inning, a run that began Aug. 8, 2011 and correlates with the team\'s transformation into a winning ballclub. The streak is the second-longest during the expansion era \xe2\x80\x94 since 1961 \xe2\x80\x94 trailing only the 1998-99 New York Yankees (116).Tuesday\'s victory, the Orioles\' fifth in their last six games, also improved their record against the AL East to 9-5, and they have won four of five series against division opponents. The Orioles (12-8), who are now a season-high four games over .500, head into today\'s series finale with a chance to sweep their first series of the season.\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a lot of bridges to cross, but I\'d rather see that than the other way,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\'s another challenge around the corner, and I\'m proud of the way they\'re taking on all of them. We know how good Toronto\'s going to be, and Tampa and New York and Boston. You\'ve just got to keep plugging along trying to do what you do best.\xe2\x80\x9dAfter opening the season 0-3 in one-run games, the Orioles have now one four straight.Last June while with the Mets, Dickey pitched a one-hit, complete-game shutout against the Orioles, striking out 13. But Tuesday, the Orioles got to Dickey early. They opened the second inning with three singles against him, none of them hit especially hard, but still damaging nonetheless.Matt Wieters had an RBI single, Nolan Reimold added a sacrifice fly, and the biggest hit in the rally was Manny Machado\'s two-out, two-run single that gave the Orioles a 4-0 lead. Already leading 2-0 with the bases loaded, Machado took the first pitch up the middle past a diving Munenori Kawasaki at shortstop.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s tough to hit that ball,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s not an easy pitch to hit. We took advantage of his mistakes with the bases loaded. We came up with big hits, scored one, then we got more. Against someone like that, a Cy Young winner, you have to go up there and take advantage of all his mistakes he makes, and we did a good job of that today.\xe2\x80\x9dOrioles starter Miguel Gonzalez made one costly mistake \xe2\x80\x94 a three-run homer by Edwin Encarnacion in the sixth that came after a pair of two-out walks \xe2\x80\x94 but he still recorded his third quality start in four outings this season. Gonzalez yielded five hits over six innings with four strikeouts and three walks.Gonzalez (2-1) made relatively easy work of the Blue Jays early, holding Toronto scoreless for five innings until running into trouble in the sixth. He has produced quality starts in seven of his last eight starts dating back to last season, all of them coming against AL East teams. He has 12 quality starts in 14 career starts against division opponents.\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of staying on my toes, I was on my heels that sixth inning,\xe2\x80\x9d Gonzalez said. \xe2\x80\x9cBalls were up. [I was] just trying to do too much when I really didn\'t need to. Good thing we got the win. We got Dickey early, which is really, really tough to get him, especially with that knuckleball. We are not used to seeing a lot.\xe2\x80\x9dDickey (2-3), who has struggled with his new team, allowed just one hit after the second inning, but he also walked a season-high five batters. He lasted six innings, allowing four runs on six hits with four strikeouts, a wild pitch and a passed ball.Acquired to a part of Toronto\'s massive offseason upgrade aimed at winning the division, Dickey has a 9.28 ERA in two starts against AL East teams this year.The Orioles bullpen locked down the Blue Jays in the final three innings. Left-hander Brian Matusz pitched a perfect seventh, notching two strikeouts.Right-hander Pedro Strop then stranded runners at first and third in the eighth by striking out Melky Cabrera to end the inning. Closer Jim Johnson pitched a scoreless ninth for his eighth save of the season.Strop and Johnson both said they didn\'t know about the 100-game winning streak when leading after seven innings.\xe2\x80\x9cI knew we\'ve been winning a lot since last year and the year before in September when everything started,\xe2\x80\x9d Strop said. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew we were winning a lot of one-run games, but I didn\'t know we had won that many.\xe2\x80\x9dSaid Johnson: \xe2\x80\x9cObviously it means that guys are throwing the ball well in the bullpen, getting put in good opportunities and doing what they\'re supposed to do. ...\xe2\x80\x9cYou\'re kind of hitting me blindsided with this, but if you look at the date, that\'s pretty much when things started to turn around here.

04/24/2013,"[('Birds Watcher: Orioles knuckle Dickey and Toronto', 'Last season during an interleague series against the Mets, the Baltimore Orioles were stifled by knuckleballer R.A. Dickey to the tune of a three-hit shutout. Hearts in Birdland were thus probably a bit heavy when Dickey ended up in Toronto this year; however the fact is that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been quite as good as advertised thus far. That continued last night, as the Orioles defeated Toronto and all of their \xe2\x80\x9cknuckleball demons\xe2\x80\x9d 4-3. Miguel Gonzalez turned in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 second consecutive quality start in a winning effort for the Birds. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 5 H, 3 R, 3 BB, 4 K. All three of those runs came on a Juan Encarnacion home run which certainly appeared as if it could be a turning point in the game. However Brian Matusz, Pedro Strop, and Jim Johnson closed the door on Toronto, keeping them in check.From a pitching perspective they say you should stay out of the big inning. Therefore from the point of view of a hitter a big inning is exactly what you want to induce. The Orioles got that in the second, and it was all they needed. Adam Jones started the inning off with an infield single, and was able to advance to second base on an error. Following singles by Chris Davis and Matt Wieters, Jones came into score and gave the Birds a 1-0 lead. Nolan Reimold was eventually able to sacrifice Davis home, and Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x98s two-RBI single scored two more. That accounts for all four of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 runs. Dickey put a couple of guys on in the first inning, and then gave up the four runs in the second. Ironically after that he seemed to zone in and at one point retired eight consecutive Orioles.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe difference between Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s start this time around and his previous few were that he attacked the strike zone. In no way am I suggesting that pitching-to-contact isn\xe2\x80\x99t a leap of faith on the part of the pitcher. I recognize that, and I recognize that it takes a special kind of person to take that leap of faith. That said, this was the first time in 2013 we had seen Gonzalez do that, which was his trademark last year. He did seem to tire towards the end of the sixth (when he gave up the home run) however he was able to get out of the inning and preserve the lead. Brian Matusz came in to pitch the seventh, and got a huge strikeout on a nasty curve ball to J.C. Arencibia.Buck Showalter also showed a lot of confidence in Pedro Strop, who\xe2\x80\x99s been struggling of late. With a man on first and nobody out in the top of the eighth Showalter lifted Matusz and brought in Strop. Generally when a reliever\xe2\x80\x99s struggling managers will bring them into games in low-yield situations so as to not put too much pressure on them and to help them gain confidence back. Strop was brought in with the game on the line and the tying run already on base. (In fairness, he did have a pretty decent outing on Saturday against Los Angeles, however most of the fan base probably held their breath when he came into the game last night.) Strop recorded the first out on a sac bunt, and the second on a ground out before walking Encarnacion and going to a full count on Melky Cabrera. Strop placed a fastball on the inside black which froze Cabrera, and got the Orioles out of the inning. Jim Johnson closed out the ninth inning, moving the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 record to 12-8.One area of concern moving forward is that experts are always saying that in some cases it takes a team a week to recover their timing and their swings after facing a knuckleballer. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of the gift that keeps on giving from the perspective of future opponents. However that\xe2\x80\x99s just something with which the Orioles will have to deal, and the fact that they head out to Oakland immediately following this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s series finale doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help. Oakland has been a notoriously difficult park for the Orioles to play over the past few years, and the fact that the A\xe2\x80\x99s have been tearing the cover off the ball won\xe2\x80\x99t help either.The Orioles will make a roster move before the game today, calling up Josh Stinson from the minor leagues. I would expect reliever Alex Burnett to be optioned back to Norfolk as the corresponding roster move, which probably won\xe2\x80\x99t formally occur until just prior to the game. Stinson will presumably remain in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 rotation for the time being given that they won\xe2\x80\x99t have an off day until after the completion of the long up coming west coast swing. Stinson will be opposed by Brandon Morrow of Toronto, who\xe2\x80\x99s still searching for his first win of the season. For fans hoping to attend today\xe2\x80\x99s game, please note the 12:30 PM start time.

But, the Orioles are on the West Coast for the next 11 games, and instead the biggest thing to be excited about for the next few hours - if it's something that excites you, which it may not unless your last name is Britton - is that Zach Britton has been recalled from Norfolk to join the Orioles in Oakland. Britton replaces Josh Stinson, whose tenure lasted less than one full day. Stinson had replaced Alex Burnett, who was in the bullpen for two games without appearing in a game. Burnett replaced Jake Arrieta, who sucked. Arrieta's turn in the rotation will be open for Monday. Britton could be the player to fill it if he's not needed to throw innings over the next few days. Through three starts in Norfolk, Britton has a 1.98 ERA, which sounds good, except he's thrown only 13.2 innings. There was a blister issue that has been cleared up, so maybe he won't have that problem whatever he does in the big leagues. If you're an optimist, then you will be thinking that the blister probably contributed to Britton issuing seven walks in those few innings. If you're a pessimist, then you will be thinking that he can't throw strikes, just like every other one-time member of the cavalry can't throw strikes, or at least they can't throw strikes without giving up home runs.    Britton, at least, is a ground-ball pitcher when all is going well - and even when it isn't, because last year he got over 60% ground balls. Wow. How do you have a 60% ground ball rate and a 5+ ERA? Maybe the 4.77 BB/9 had something to do with that. Throw strikes! Throw strikes. Throw strikes. Pretty please, throw strikes. Pretty please starters go deep into the next four games so Britton isn't needed out of the bullpen and we don't have to endure Freddy Garcia making the Monday start. Thank you.

04/26/2013,"[(""O's 10, A's 2: McLouth keys victory in Oakland - Camden Chat"", ' Having to get on a plane and fly to Oakland, California just a short while after losing a baseball game in extra innings has to be difficult.  That the guy who beat you was Maicer Izturis, and that the way he beat you was a bases loaded walk had to sting a whole hell of a lot more.  Winning big in Oakland tonight probably went a long way to erasing the sting of yesterday\'s painful loss. I\'m not going to front, this was a hard game to stay up to watch.  As I mentioned in today\'s open thread, I just got confirmation that I\'ve succesfully completed my graduate program this afternoon and I decided to go celebrate with the wife and kids.  But I promised Stacey that I wouldn\'t flake and...oh yeah, the game. The O\'s and the A\'s both wasted opportunities in the very first inning as both clubs got the leadoff batter on base only to see their efforts wasted with ground ball double plays.  This of course was prelude to an absolute nightmate of a second inning for Orioles starter Jason Hammel. With one out, Orioles SS J.J. Hardy was eaten up on a nasty short hop off the bat of Brandon Moss and charged with his third error of the year.  Next man up Chris Young smoked a ball down the third base line but Manny Machado was money, yet again, making a sterling (or gold, hint hint) backhanded play and nailing Young at first base for the second out.  Machado did roll the wrist on his glove hand, scaring every single Orioles fan watching the game, but proved to be OK as he stayed in the game.    With a runner on second base and two outs, Josh Reddick stepped to the plate for Oakland and was pitched around, taking his base after four straight pitches missed from Hammel.  Jason fell behind the next batter for Oakland, Josh Donaldson, who hit a 3-1 pitch on a line to deep center field.  No problem, Adam Jones was there and...he misplayed another fly ball, this time clunking it off of his wrist, scoring two runs.  Jones was not charged with and error and so goes another episode in the #stayhungry chronicles.    Things looked to be getting potentially worse when on the next play, Manny Machado sailed a throw to first base, pulling Chris Davis off the bag for Manny\'s first error of the season. No worries, as CoCo Crisp grounded out to James Jerry who was able to make this play, ending the inning with no further damage and the birds trailing 2-0. The Orioles did not let the miscues of the previous half an inning get them down, as a preictable swinging strikeout from Ryan Flaherty was followed by a double to right field from Nolan Reimold.  Next up, Nate McLouth sent a ball back up the middle into center field to score Reimold, then stole second base during Manny Machado\'s at bat.  Machado would pop out, but a single by Nick Markakis would plate McLouth and Adam Jones made up at least partially for his blunder in the field with a double into the left field corner.  Markakis was waved around by a windmill wearing an Orioles uniform at third base and slid in safely to score the Orioles third run, a lead they would not relinquish.    Immediately after Markakis scored to give the Orioles the lead, Athletics pitching coach Curt Young went out ostensibly to visit his pitcher but decided that he\'d rather complain to first base umpire Jim Reynolds about a check swing call from two batters ago and got tossed without even saying a word to Jarrod Parker.  Also interesting to note that the very next pitch appeared to hit Chris Davis on the top of his left foot, something video replays seemed to uphold as actually occuring, but Davis was called back into the box and struck out to end the inning. He would be avenged. The fourth inning was tame in comparison but did feature a pretty ridiculous catch in the left field corner by Chris Young, robbing Matt Wieters of extra bases.  Oh, and Flaherty got a hit, imagine that. The Orioles would score another run on a Markakis sac fly in the fifth inning, which came to be because Nate McLouth again led off the inning by getting on base, this time with a double, followed by a Machado sac bunt, and scoring on Markakis\' fly ball,giving the club a 4-2 lead. Jason Hammel was doing his job at this point, recovering from the craziness of the second inning by retiring the next six batters he faced.  Hammel did allow Donaldson to reach on a walk but he was immediately erased by a double play ball and CoCo Crisp would end the fifth with a weak ground out to Chris Davis. Chris Davis avenged the whole hit by pitch debacle of his previous at bat by casually flicking his wrists and dropping some knowledge on the folks  a couple rows up in the left field seats, his eighth home run of the season, making it 5-2, Orioles. Matt Wieters followed Davis\' home run with a single, advanced to second on a wild pitch by Jarrod Parker, and advanced to third on a groundout by J.J. Hardy.  Ryan Flaherty walked (it\'s true!) and stole second, bringing up Nolan Reimold, who also walked.  End of the road for Jarrod Parker, who pitched terribly and was relieved by Chris Resop. Nate McLouth then hit a tailor-made double play ball to second baseman Eric Sogard, but Nolan\'s hard slide and Nate\'s hustle prevented the double play, scoring the Orioles\' sixth run of the night. The Athletics would threaten one last time in the sixth inning during what can best be described as ""technical difficulties"" on the part of MASN, who not only lost their video feed but also their ability to broadcast in something approximating an FM signal, as both Gary Thorne and Jim Palmer sounded as if they were broadcasting from Malaysia.  Hammel retired Josh Reddick to start the inning on a nasty curveball before plunking Seth Smith and allowing a single to Jed Lowrie.  Brandon Moss would work the count full but popped out to Manny Machado in foul territory for the second out, and Hammel would end his evening by retiring Chris Young on a fly ball to Adam Jones, who decided he would actually catch this one. The Orioles would add two runs in each the 7th and 8th innings, running the score up to 10-2, as the Orioles bullpen somewhat shakily held the lead, preserving the Orioles victory.  Early defensive issues and injury scares aside, the Orioles never really were threatened by Oakland after taking the lead in the third, and look to continue their success tomorrow, as Wei-Yin Chen takes the hill against Tom Milone at 10:05 pm.

Those are the rules. The Orioles do not care about your rules. A seven-run offensive effort was powered by home runs by Nick Markakis (3rd of the year) - His Noodly Appendages Himself - Adam Jones (4th), and Nate McLouth (1st). The three home runs were part of a barrage of ten hits and led to a 7-3 victory, guaranteeing the O\'s a series win and giving them a chance at a rare four-game sweep tomorrow afternoon. The runs were scored to the benefit of Orioles starter Chris Tillman, whose box score line looks much better than it seemed like it would be at first. 6 IP, 7 H, 2 ER, 2 BB, 7 K. That\'ll do, especially when he looked like he was chugging along to barely make it five innings. Three baserunners in each of the second and third innings, with Tillman looking like he couldn\'t locate anything, and yet, he did what so many Orioles starters have failed to do over the years: he rallied through the trouble, giving up only a run in each of those innings. As helpless as Tillman looked at times in those two innings, he made Athletics hitters look just as helpless as he racked up the seven strikeouts. They could only stand with bat on shoulder as Tillman painted the corners with fastballs. Who is this guy and why don\'t we see him more often? This, against the highest-scoring offense in baseball heading into today\'s games.    Same as the first game of the series, the Orioles spotted the A\'s two runs, looking pathetic and helpless in the process - the first time through the lineup against A\'s starter A.J. Griffin was a disaster - and then went to work. Manny Machado worked a walk to lead off the fourth. He did not stay on first base for long, scoring on Markakis\' homer. Jones made it back-to-back by unloading a line drive to straightaway center. As frustrating a player as he can be sometimes, it\'s easy to forget how strong he is.    Later that same inning brought another rarity: an Orioles baserunner scoring from first. On a single, no less. And the runner was Chris Davis! What in the world? J.J. Hardy hit the single. Davis had been running on the pitch and he just kept on running. There are times where the cavernous outfield of the Coliseum plays to the advantage of the offense. McLouth was nearly a one-man army, as he\'s seemed to be in a few games this season. His day included a 3-5 with the home run and two RBI. He\'s now slashing .319/.434/.449 on the season. Small sample size, to be sure, through only 24 games, but if I might paraphrase my friend and fellow blogger, Stacey Long: ""24 AWESOME games.""    McLouth\'s homer and an RBI single came in the 8th and 9th innings, respectively, and they would prove to be insurance runs the Orioles would need. The bullpen could not just let us have an easy one on this Saturday afternoon. After pitching a scoreless 7th, Brian Matusz came out for the 8th, got a quick out, then walked Brandon Moss. With righties coming up, Buck summoned Darren O\'Day, who gave up a double to Josh Donaldson and then an RBI sacrifice fly to Josh Reddick. Because he\'s O\'Day, he then struck out Chris Young, with Young looking like he could have batted against O\'Day a hundred times without ever getting a hit, to end the threat. With a 7-3 lead going into the 9th, you wouldn\'t have thought the Orioles would need Jim Johnson today. Unfortunately, you can\'t forget about Pedro Strop. The bad Strop showed up today. He hit Adam Rosales with a pitch on a full count, uncorked a wild pitch against Coco Crisp and then proceeded to walk Crisp. Buck was quick with the hook and in came the closer. Johnson would give up a base hit to John Jaso to load the bases and bring the tying run to the plate with no one out. This was all very unnecessary drama, but drama it was. A Seth Smith flyout wasn\'t deep enough to score a run, then Johnson got one of his patented ground-balls for a double play to bring an end to a great game that nonetheless had its messy and tense moments. The save was Johnson\'s 10th of the year. Last year, he got his 10th save in the Orioles\' 33rd game. Matt Wieters, hitless on the day and looking helpless at bat, was the designated hitter (because of course an Orioles designated hitter can\'t get hits), but he had to catch the last few innings after Taylor Teagarden took a foul ball off of the thumb on his glove hand, dislocating the thumb. He told reporters after the game he expected to be out 3-4 weeks. Oakland waited until Wieters was behind the dish to try to steal on him - and as it turned out, Tillman picked off Josh Donaldson and Wieters never had to throw. The Teagarden injury resulted in Tillman actually recording an at-bat in the game, which had the potential to be amusing, only Tillman watched three strikes go by, with Griffin showing off by dropping a curveball in for the strikeout. Daniel Cabrera would have been proud. Tillman\'s at-bat was more curious because he was lifted before pitching in the next inning. Machado and Markakis each had multi-hit games for the Orioles in addition to McLouth. The final game of the series gets underway tomorrow at 4:05 Eastern. Miguel Gonzalez starts for the Orioles as they go for the sweep. He\'ll be opposed by the recently-PED-riddled mass of flesh that is Bartolo Colon.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Chen deals Orioles to another western victory', 'The Baltimore Orioles could probably get used to this west coast thing if they keep winning games. However as has always been the case they\xe2\x80\x99ll only keep winning if they focus on one game at a time and not get ahead of themselves. That aside, Wei-Yin Chen turned in what was without a doubt the best start of the season from an Oriole pitcher. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 8 IP, 2 H, 2 BB, 5 K. With that, Chen became the first Oriole pitcher to go seven innings plus in 2013 (eight innings at that).Unfortunately for Chen, he was matched pretty much pitch-by-pitch by Oakland starter Tommy Milone. This was the kind of game where it was almost unfair that one guy had to lose. Oakland obtained Milone as a minor league prospect in the trade that sent Gio Gonzalez to the Washington Nationals last year. They brought him to the big leagues in 2012, and he thrived last year. 2013 has brought some struggles for Milone, however he probably turned in his best effort of the season last night in a losing effort.Courtesy of Ed Szczepanski-USA TODAY SportsThis game was your classic pitchers duel, and it was scoreless until the top of the seventh. If this was a staring contest luckily for Chen and the O\xe2\x80\x99s, Milone blinked first. J.J. Hardy led off the inning with a single, and was able to advance to second on Josh Reddick\xe2\x80\x98s error. With one out, designated hitter Steve Pearce came to the plate and promptly singled Hardy home. That went as an unearned run against Milone, however it also gave the Orioles a lead which would stand up.Admittedly I was a bit surprised that Buck Showalter sent Chen back out to pitch the eighth inning. His pitch count wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too high, however with such a slim lead it felt like the perfect time to turn things over to one of the best bullpens in baseball. Chen struggled a bit with two outs, but ultimately was able to record all three without incident. In total Chen threw 106 pitches, and admittedly Showalter probably saved the use of a reliever by sending him back out and getting him through eight. With the doubleheader last weekend, an extra-inning game (that required the use of multiple relievers) on Wednesday, and the trip out west Wednesday evening, the Oriole bullpen appears to be surprisingly rested. They only needed two relievers on Thursday, and neither of them worked last night. Therefore going into this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game one would imagine that the entire bullpen is available for work.Just for good measure, the Birds added two insurance runs in the top of the ninth. With the bases loaded and one down, Nate McLouth pinch-hit for Alexi Casilla and reached base on another Oakland error. Nick Markakis then hit a sac fly to left field, scoring Chris Dickerson (who had come on to pinch-run for Nolan Reimold). Buck Showalter had been warming up closer Jim Johnson as well as Brian Matusz in the pen, and had the O\xe2\x80\x99s taken a lead of 4-0 or more Matusz probably would have come in to pitch the last of the ninth. However with the game at 3-0 and thus a save situation, Johnson entered the game and after allowing one base runner shut down Oakland in the ninth to close out another win.I mentioned the Oriole pen above; Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen is probably fairly gassed. They were somewhat in the same boat as the Orioles coming into the series in that they finished a series with Boston (at Fenway) and flew cross-country to come home. (In fact, their game in Boston was Wednesday night where as the O\xe2\x80\x99s played Toronto in the afternoon.) However they were forced to use multiple relievers on Thursday night, and then another three relievers last night after Milone departed.Birdland will get a respite from the late-night 10 PM starts today and tomorrow, as the Orioles will play Oakland on both days at 4 PM. We won\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure until the lineups are published, but I would expect Taylor Teagarden to be behind the dish this afternoon given that it\xe2\x80\x99s a day game after a night game. The Orioles will send Chris Tillman to the mound this afternoon, coming off of a great start against Toronto on Monday night in which he was non decisioned. Tillman will be opposed by A.J. Griffin of Oakland. If the Orioles can win either this afternoon or tomorrow, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have won their first series at the Oakland Coliseum since July of 2007.

Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsDuring the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first home stand with the Twins, Adam Jones hit a fly ball that appeared to be an out. As most big leaguers do, Adam jogged half-hearted to first base, head hanging. But the ball wasn\xe2\x80\x99t caught. Once Adam realized the play was botched, he turned on the jets and got into second base. If he\xe2\x80\x99d been running the whole way, he may have been able to advance the third base. There was a second ball, a grounder during the same series that Adam also didn\xe2\x80\x99t run out. Since then, the entire team has been running much harder.As a baseball fan, nothing grates on my nerves more than seeing a guy hit what he assumes is a groundout or a fly out and jog casually toward first base.Yes, most of the time it will be an out. However, in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game alone, Oakland committed 3errors. JJ Hardy hit a single in the 7th inning that he alertly turned into a double by keeping his head up, and running hard. Hardy is possibly one of the slowest guys on the team, but by remaining focused and alert, he got into scoring position and\xc2\xa0came around to score on Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x98s single. The score remained 1-0 until the top of the 9th.Earlier in the same game, Nolan Reimold ran hard when he hit a ground ball to the first baseman and was able to beat the pitcher, Tommy Milone to the bag. Even when the opposition is executing plays, often times we are seeing Oriole runners being thrown out by just a step, or a half step. These guys are running out every ball, and it\xe2\x80\x99s turning into runs.Take notice of this trend if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t already, it\xe2\x80\x99s really great to see. That never say die attitude is what drives this team, and it\xe2\x80\x99s really exciting to watch. It shows that this team takes pride in what they do. That makes me proud to be an Orioles fan.

Encina | The Baltimore SunBOWIE -- Orioles pitching prospect Kevin Gausman has hit some rough patches through the first few weeks of his first full professional season while pitching at Double-A Bowie, but the 22-year-old right-hander\xe2\x80\x99s steady development continues to be more important than any pitching line.Gausman, who is\xc2\xa0ranked the No. 2 prospect in the\xc2\xa0Orioles\'\xc2\xa0organization and No. 26 in all of baseball by Baseball America,\xc2\xa0will enter his fifth start of the season on Sunday against Harrisburg with a 1-2 record and a 4.74 ERA and has allowed four or more earned runs in two of his four starts.But he\xe2\x80\x99s throwing strikes at a 71.3 percent clip, has 21 strikeouts to just one walk and has a\xc2\xa0groundball-to-flyout ratio of 5.2 to 1, all good marks. var adSkipCounter = 0; \xe2\x80\x9cI feel healthy, my arm feels great, my [velocity\xe2\x80\x99s] been pretty solid, my stuff\xe2\x80\x99s been there,\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman said Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cI think there have been some times when I\xe2\x80\x99ve left the ball up in fastball counts and that\xe2\x80\x99s something you definitely can\xe2\x80\x99t do here. I think the hitters in big-league camp, they\xe2\x80\x99re so good that I think they have a better approach up there. Here, they\xe2\x80\x99re all looking for fastballs, so when they see one, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to go for it. I think I\xe2\x80\x99m getting better.\xe2\x80\x9dPlaying at Double-A is commonly seen as a proving ground, and Gausman said he\xe2\x80\x99s quickly learning that there is such a thing as being around the strike zone too much.\xe2\x80\x9cYou want guys to not be comfortable facing you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you know a guy\xe2\x80\x99s going to be around the zone so much, you\xe2\x80\x99re not worried that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to come in on you too much or make you chase pitches in the dirt. I\xe2\x80\x99d say I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to expand the zone when I have two strikes. That\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to do more of, try to throw pitches that are unhittable with two strikes and if they do chase they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to hit it very hard or they\xe2\x80\x99re going to miss. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been focusing on. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough because I have been around the zone and when you feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re throwing strikes to every batter you feel like it should be easier than it is.\xe2\x80\x9dThat will get easier as Gausman continues to develop his slider to complement his fastball and a changeup that will play at the major league level.When the Orioles reassigned Gausman to minor-league camp this spring, they told him they wanted him to work on getting adjusted to a five-man rotation \xe2\x80\x93 remember this time last year, the LSU product was still pitching in the SEC \xe2\x80\x93 and to refine his slider. If he can develop that slider \xe2\x80\x93 a pitch Gausman made tremendous strides with during instructional league -- as an out pitch that he can both throw for a strike and make hitters chase, he could be in the big leagues sooner than later.\xe2\x80\x9cI know I can throw it for a strike,\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I can throw it 1-2 in the dirt and make them chase. One thing I\xe2\x80\x99m working on right now is kind of a back-foot slider to lefties.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cI think I struggled a bit early but I think I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to hit my stride,\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think that\xe2\x80\x99s good for me because it shows that I need to work on some things and just keep getting better every day.

04/29/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Bullpen help in the pipeline?', 'The biggest issue staring the Baltimore Orioles right in the fact right now is the fact that the bullpen is a bit overworked. In monitoring twitter, facebook, and other social media after the game, a lot of fans seemed to be angered by this as if it were something that just happened. The fact is that the bullpen was gassed well before yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s blown game in Oakland; that was just the first time that it had cost the Orioles a game. However for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth as the Birds go into tonight\xe2\x80\x99s series opener in Seattle, Tommy Hunter, T.J. McFarland, and Jim Johnson did not work in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game. Therefore the Birds do in theory have some fresh arms in the pen, and I would suspect that either McFarland or Hunter would be the perennial first guy out of the pen if needed tonight. (And Johnson is obviously available if needed to close.)However might there be a way for the Orioles to get some bullpen relief moving forward? The O\xe2\x80\x99s have off days on May 6th, 13th, and 15th. (And for the record, that\xe2\x80\x99s some pretty poor scheduling on the part of MLB to have a team have two days off during a homestand while they have no day in between finishing up a series at home and opening another on the opposite coast.) Zach Britton will slide into the #5 starter role tonight, and his turn in the rotation would in theory come up again on Saturday afternoon in Anaheim. With the days off in between, the O\xe2\x80\x99s could certainly afford to send Britton (or someone else for that matter) back to the minor leagues in order to call up and carry an extra reliever on the roster.Courtesy of USA TodayI would suspect and hope that this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s being thrown around between Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette as we speak. In order to garner the most return out of a move like this, the O\xe2\x80\x99s would want to decide on who they wanted to summon to the big league club, and have that person join the team either on Saturday or Sunday in Anaheim. As soon as Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game is complete, they could option Britton back to triple-A, and add the new guy to the roster to be available to pitch in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s series finale. If needed, that guy could be the long man or first guy up in the pen on Sunday, which would still make him available to pitch next Tuesday in relief if needed when the O\xe2\x80\x99s welcome the Kansas City Royals to Camden Yards on Tuesday night.Given the frequency of the days off ahead, that would also allow the Orioles to go with a four-man rotation and to keep that fifth starter (presumably Britton) in the minors for the required ten days before recalling him. The way the season has shaped up for the first month or so, that extra reliever might serve the club better than carry a fifth starter when it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary to do so. Given this scenario, my guess would be that Steve Johnson (who\xe2\x80\x99s currently making some rehab appearances in Norfolk) might be the first guy called up. Johnson of course made some starts towards the end of last season, however again at the moment I feel that the bullpen is something that needs attention.If the Orioles go this route, my guess is that it would happen regardless of what happens this week. For all we know the O\xe2\x80\x99s get a string of starts whereby the starter goes deep into the game coming up over the course of the next few days, giving the pen some rest. However again I suspect that if the scenario laid out above were to come to fruition, it would happen withstanding that possibility. I also suspect that it could happen regardless of how Britton pitches tonight and presumably on Saturday. He could have two great starts and end up on the way back to the minors. But that\xe2\x80\x99s part of baseball (roster games that is).As I said above, the Orioles do have three starters with a minimum of one game\xe2\x80\x99s rest going into Seattle tonight. Safeco Field\xe2\x80\x99s dimensions changed over the off season with the fences being brought in, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still a park that will play better for pitchers than hitters. It will also be nice for the Orioles to see Robert Andino, their former teammate who was dealt to Seattle in the off season. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

I think they have done a good job with their minor league system, bringing guys up. It\xe2\x80\x99s proof that if you play people the right way, you can win a lot of games.\xe2\x80\x9cI believe the Baltimore Orioles are on the right track. They have great role players, great young players, great balance from top to bottom, great pitching. The manager is an unbelievable manager. I have a lot of respect for him. He\xe2\x80\x99s done a great job with that team.\xe2\x80\x9dShowalter managed against Alomar for several years, including in the early to mid 1990s, when he was with the New York Yankees and Alomar played for the Blue Jays and Orioles.\xe2\x80\x9cHe could dial up what was needed. You guys need a longball, here. You need a single and steal a base. You need a turned double play, a tough one. It seemed like he could dial up what was needed for the moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cVery alert guy to what situations he would think might be developing. Nothing caught him by surprise.

Mandatory Credit: Rob Foldy-USA TODAY Sports2001: Mike Fontenot \xe2\x80\x93 Fontenot developed a nice career for himself as a utility infielder. Now 32 and playing for the Tampa Bay Rays, the Orioles drafted Fontenot as a 2nd baseman with pick 19 of the 2001 draft. Fontenot spent four years in the Orioles farm system before being traded to the Cubs in 2005 along with Jerry Hairston and Dave Crouthers for Sammy Sosa. Fontenot guest-starred on the season 3 finale of the TBS baseball-themed comedy series My Boys.2002: Adam Loewen \xe2\x80\x93 When he was drafted 4th overall by Baltimore, Loewen was the highest drafted Canadian player in the history of the draft. In 2004, Loewen was listed by Baseball America as Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s highest rated prospect, but a stress fracture in his forearm/elbow forced him from the mound, and he was converted to a 1st baseman/outfielder. He was released by the Orioles in 2008 and ended up with the Toronto Blue Jays, where in 2011, against the Orioles and Tommy Hunter, no less, he hit his first major league home run. Loewen is still with the Blue Jays, right now at their AA level.2003: Nick Markakis \xe2\x80\x93 Markakis was the first \xe2\x80\x9chit\xe2\x80\x9d so to speak, draft pick by the Orioles in many years. Other than Brian Roberts, he is the longest tenured Orioles, in the middle of his 10th year with the team. When he was drafted, Markakis clocked in at 96 MPH with his fastball, but the team grabbed him for his hitting potential. He made the Opening Day roster and has been a mainstay ever since. His timely hitting and consistent has earned him a Gold Glove as well as a massive 6 year $66.1 million dollar extension in 2009, and the admiration of many fans because he probably could have received more from another team but chose to stay with the Orioles.Apr. 12, 2013; Bronx, NY, USA; Baltimore Orioles right fielder Nick Markakis (21) singles to left against the New York Yankees during the eighth inning at Yankee Stadium. Yankees won 5-2.

A college star, he\xe2\x80\x99s now 30 years old and currently a free agent.2005: Brandon Snyder \xe2\x80\x93 Before Matt Wieters, there was Brandon Snyder. Drafted 13th overall as a catcher by the O\xe2\x80\x99s in 2005, he spent five years in the minors before getting to the major leagues in 2010. He drifted between the minors and the majors over the next couple of years before being traded to Texas in 2012. He hit his first major league home run in May 2012 with Texas, but was released in March 2013 and currently has a minor league deal with the Boston Red Sox.2006: William Rowell \xe2\x80\x93 Billy Rowell was drafted 9th overall in 2006, and spent 6 years in the Orioles minor league system. A towering 6\xe2\x80\x995\xe2\x80\xb3 pitcher/3rd baseman, he was tagged with a 50 game suspension in May 2012 for a 2nd violation of the major league drug program.

A lanky fireballer of a pitcher, what Matusz struggled with early on was consistency and confidence. When Matusz came back to the team after a trip to the minors last year, manager Buck Showalter made the decision to move him from the rotation to the bullpen, and it looked like the lightbulb went on. Matusz finished the season on a tear, his fastball almost unhittable and pitching well against the Rangers and Yankees in the playoffs.2009: Matthew Hobgood \xe2\x80\x93 Drafted 5th overall in 2009, Micah Hobgood is a name many fans probably don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but may get to know over the next few years.

Machado was intriguing, if a little unproven, but the Orioles promoted him to plug the hole at 3rd base on August 9th 2012. The next day, he had his first multi-homer game.

05/03/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Hometown boy makes good - Birds Watcher', 'As was stated yesterday, Chris Tillman grew up in Anaheim, California. Presumably it had to be kind of an exciting place to grow up with both the Angels and Disneyland in the neighborhood. Also presumably, he had to have seen his his share of Angels games at \xe2\x80\x9cthe big A,\xe2\x80\x9d perhaps even a few against the Baltimore Orioles. So I would think all of that had to be in his head when he took to the mound for the first time in his professional career in his hometown. I know that speaking for myself, it would be a humbling experience, and probably a little surreal. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 8 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 2 BB, 3 K.We saw some drama early on in the game when after two walks Tillman allowed a single with two on to Josh Hamilton. Mike Trout appeared to be coming in to score, however Nick Markakis teamed up with Matt Wieters to nail the youngster at home plate. That set an early tone to a game that the Orioles would dominate from start to finish. Nolan Reimold scored on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single in the third inning, and the Orioles led 1-0. Adam Jones would score on Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-double in the sixth, and Reimold would score again in the seventh to give the Orioles a 2-0 lead on a Nick Markakis RBI-double.Anaheim starter Joe Blanton actually matched Tillman pitch-for-pitch to a certain point. Both pitchers went eight innings, however Blanton tired out at the end. This is the second consecutive night that the Orioles have been held at bay by a pitcher who had been struggling. After Blanton departed with the O\xe2\x80\x99s leading 3-0, Nate McLouth sent a deep shot to center following a Reimold infield single. The ball going over the wall all but sealed the game for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, although Albert Pujols would homer off of closer Jim Johnson in the last of the ninth to put the final score at 5-1. (Johnson had already been warming up when McLouth hit the home run, however he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t appeared in a game since Saturday in Oakland so Buck Showalter went ahead and played him.)Courtesy of Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY SportsThis was perhaps the best start of Chris Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s still young career. Besides the longevity in the game and the three hits, the thing that sticks out for me is how many first pitch strikes that were thrown. Granted he was pitching against a lineup that\xe2\x80\x99s keenly aware of the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be much better than their record indicates, and it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that they\xe2\x80\x99re pushing a bit too much. However that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what can happen when a pitcher attacks the strike zone as opposed to tentatively nibbling. That makes a big difference sometimes. The affect of Trout being thrown out at home plate early in the game probably can\xe2\x80\x99t be understated either. That could have been a totally different game had the Orioles trailed early. One thing is certain however; they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have given up in the game.The series continues tonight at 10 PM eastern time as Miguel Gonzalez returns to the scene of his first big league start last year to pitch against Anaheim. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Jason Vargas, who\xe2\x80\x99s coming off his best start of the season last Sunday against Seattle.

Encina | The Baltimore SunANAHEIM, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 As a veteran of 14 major league seasons, it took a while for right-hander Freddy Garcia to get used to those long bus rides in Triple-A.But when the 36-year-old pitcher decided to sign a minor league deal with the Orioles before this season \xe2\x80\x94 and then agreed to remain with the organization past his initial opt-out date earlier this week \xe2\x80\x94 he had the faith that he\'d soon pitch again in the big leagues.Garcia will make his Orioles and 2013 major league debut on Saturday against the Los Angeles Angels at Angel Stadium, where he is 8-1 with a 3.18 ERA in 16 career starts. Garcia, who spent his first six seasons pitching in the American League West with the Seattle Mariners, is 16-3 with a 2.66 ERA in 28 career starts against the Angels. var adSkipCounter = 0; ""There was no way I was going to go to another Triple-A team, and I got called up,"" said Garcia, who joined the Orioles in Anaheim on Friday. ""It was the best for me to stay there and pitch whatever [games] I had to pitch and finally they called me up. I know they need pitching. At some point, they would need me. This division is one of the toughest ones in baseball, and they always need pitching. \xe2\x80\xa6""I know I can pitch and I can help the team win games and throw innings. They need guys to pitch innings here to save the bullpen, because the bullpen is really one of their strengths. [If] you kill your bullpen early in the season, a couple months later it\'s going to hurt.""Garcia said it was initially a tough adjustment trying to work his way back to the big leagues through the minors. But he recently was awarded the International League pitcher of the week award after going 2-0 with a 1.69 ERA last week for Norfolk, and led the league in wins (four) and innings pitched (33 2/3).""I was working really hard,"" Garcia said. ""I told myself, \'You\'re there. You have to keep your mind there.\' There\'s no dreaming about stuff. It\'s not easy when you play in the big leagues for so long and now you\'re a regular Triple-A guy. You\'re doing the same stuff they do, wherever they eat, whatever hotel they stay in, the long bus rides, all kind of stuff. You can not take it for granted. You have to keep working hard and make it happen, man.""Orioles manager Buck Showalter has said that he hopes someone eventually takes the reins of the open fifth starter slot in the team\'s rotation. Garcia, who was released by the San Diego Padres at the end of spring training, hopes that\'s him.""I really don\'t care what people say,"" Garcia said. ""I just go out there and do my job. \xe2\x80\xa6 I really don\'t care, because I always put up numbers and that\'s all you can really do is keep putting up numbers.""Said Showalter: ""He\'s pitched pretty well. This is not a guy that was a failed starter in the big leagues. I\'ll tell you another thing: Everybody early in the season carries better stuff than they do later on, so he\'s pretty fresh right now.""Reimold leads offComing off one of his best offensive performances of the season on Thursday, left fielder Nolan Reimold batted leadoff for the first time this season on Friday.Reimold was 2-for-4 with three runs scored in the Orioles\' 5-1 win over the Angels on Thursday night, picking up 15 points to his batting average \xe2\x80\x94 from .203 to .218.""I think I\'m starting to feel a little better at the plate,"" Reimold said. ""Hitting isn\'t just swinging. There\'s a feel to it. You\'ve just got to work to get the feel back and get comfortable.""Reimold entered Friday 3-for-9 with a homer and two RBIs in his career against Angels starter Jason Vargas.""[I] wanted to get him a couple more at-bats,"" Showalter said of Reimold. ""I think he\'s getting close to being in a pretty good place. We\'ll see. He\'s had a little success off Vargas. We\'ve got a very versatile lineup and fortunately there are not a whole lot of questions about where they are hitting. They just want to play.""Before a herniated disc in his neck required season-ending surgery after just 15 games last season, Reimold batted nearly exclusively from the leadoff spot in 2012, and he also hit atop the order this spring.Avoiding the hiveThe camera behind home plate at Angel Stadium was covered with bees during Thursday\'s game, which made for some uneasy moments for catcher Matt Wieters when he went to chase down a foul ball near the backstop.""Wieters went back for a pop-up kind of over there early in the game,"" Showalter said. ""He walked by me and goes, \'That took a little courage there.\' If you don\'t look at the camera and get the chill bumps, you should be on Animal Planet. I couldn\'t quit looking on it.

05/04/2013,"[('Not everyone will see the Orioles today - Birds Watcher', 'In a few moments the Baltimore Orioles will take on the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in a game that will be shown on FOX television. However not all Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans will have the opprotunity to see the game, as FOX is also showing the game between the Washington Nationals and Pittsburgh Pirates. The mid-Atlantic region will in effect be split in two, as people that live in the Washington DC television market\xc2\xa0will see the Nats, and the people in the Baltimore television market will see the O\xe2\x80\x99s. (The complete coverage map can be seen here.)When the Nationals came to DC, both the Orioles and Nationals were given territorial rights in both cities. I won\xe2\x80\x99t go into this ad hoc, however the gist is that both teams will be televised in both cities. However in this case both cities\xe2\x80\x99 FOX affiliates are obviously bound to show that city\xe2\x80\x99s local team. Again without going into too much detail regarding the bylaws involved with MLB games on TV, the agreement between the league and FOX prohibits the following:Regional sports networks (such as MASN) from televising games simultaneous to FOX\xe2\x80\x99s gamesFOX games from being shown on the MLB Extra Innings packageAny network other than FOX televising a game that is being televised by FOX (Translated, this means that MASN couldn\xe2\x80\x99t televise the game as well as FOX.)In a nutshell, unless you live in the immediate Baltimore TV market, on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, or in another part of the region that\xe2\x80\x99ll get the O\xe2\x80\x99s, you have no way of seeing the game. The same is true in reverse for the Nationals. Any DC fans that happen to live closer to Baltimore or on the Eastern Shore of Maryland have no way\xc2\xa0of seeing their team play.Courtesy of USA TodayThis is not an Orioles vs. Nationals column, as both fan bases are in the same boat in a sense. I like MLB\xe2\x80\x99s FOX Saturday Baseball programming a lot, however I do think that the program should involve two minor caveats: either FOX cannot televise two teams within the same region, or they allow for the other game to air on another station. Speaking to the first point, that would mean that FOX would be unable to televise both the Orioles and Nationals, Yankees and Mets, Cubs and White Sox, A\xe2\x80\x99s and Giants, etc. at the same time. However that second point would come into play if FOX insisted on still being able to televise the two teams. They would have to allow the other game to be farmed out to another station. In this case, perhaps channel 20 in DC could carry FOX\xe2\x80\x99s feed of the Orioles game while channel 54 in Baltimore could carry FOX\xe2\x80\x99s feed of the Nats.The blackout on MLB Extra Innings is a problem also. On any other day if you were an Orioles fan in Bethesda, MD. you could go to your neighborhood sports bar and see the O\xe2\x80\x99s (provided that they have MLB Extra Innings of course). However FOX blacks their games out for that program, which makes no sense. This apparently is set to change in 2014 as they\xe2\x80\x99ll be allowed, however what FOX and MLB is mandating is that fans get in their cars and drive to an area that\xe2\x80\x99s showing the game.

Normally I try not to use such strong adjectives, however what more can you say about someone that flirted with a no-hitter for that span of time? Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6.2 IP, 3 H, 2 R, 1 BB, 2 K. Garcia obviously is a 36-year old journeyman who\xe2\x80\x99s trying to resurrect his career and the O\xe2\x80\x99s are giving him a shot. Again if a first impression means anything, he seems to be soaking up that chance.The Birds got what appears to be some good news about Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x98 knee just prior to the game, as GM Dan Duquette said that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe Davis will need to go to the DL. Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 physicians will read the MRI (which was conducted yesterday morning) in full on tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s off day, however Davis was feeling much better yesterday morning. The got off to an early lead when Manny Machado launched a home run in the first inning of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game. The Orioles seemed to have guys on base throughout starter Tommy Hanson\xe2\x80\x98s time in the game, and perhaps more embarrassingly (to Hanson) they seemed to run at will. As good as Garcia was, Hanson seemingly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the strike zone. His pitches seemed to tail off to the third base side of home plate, and Oriole hitters were more than happy to take pitches (which is a good sign).One of the underlying game stories was that through nine innings the O\xe2\x80\x99s were 0-for-10 with runners-in-scoring-position, and they left eight men on base. They were getting guys on base against Hanson, they just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t drive them home. J.J. Hardy added to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead in the second with a solo home run, Nolan Reimold scored Manny Machado with a sac fly in the fifth, and then hit another solo homer in the seventh. The Orioles led 4-0, and Garcia was cruising\xe2\x80\xa6so quickly in fact that suddenly he was throwing a no-hitter in the sixth. The thing that struck me the most about Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s outing was how he was getting his off-speed and breaking pitches over for strikes. The ball must really have been coming off his hand tightly given that those pitches were freezing the Anaheim hitters.Alex Aybar broke up the no-hit bid in the seventh with a base hit, and then Trumbo\xe2\x80\x99s aforementioned homer cut the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead to 4-2. However Anaheim rallied again in the last of the eighth, starting with a bunt single against the shift in by Hank Conger. That\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to defend against the shift as a hitter, and Conger did it perfectly. Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day uncharacteristically struggled in the eighth, surrendering two runs (which tied the game at four) and at one point throwing eight consecutive balls. I was a little surprised that Buck Showalter left O\xe2\x80\x99Day in to complete the eighth inning with his struggles, as Brian Matusz appeared to be ready in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pen. However after Mike Trout\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single that tied the game (and non-decisioning Garcia who pitched his tail off), O\xe2\x80\x99Day struck out Albert Pujols to end the threat.Tommy Hunter pitched the last of the ninth, and he promptly walked Mark Trumbo. However with a 2-2 count on Alberto Callaspo Trumbo got greedy and tried to steal. While starting catcher Matt Wieters was on the bench yesterday, Chris Snyder did his best Wieters impression and gunned Trumbo down at second. That\xe2\x80\x99s a play that will go largely unremembered in the overall game story, however make no mistake about the fact that it was huge. When you\xe2\x80\x99re in the last of the ninth or in extras and you erase a base runner like that, you\xe2\x80\x99ve potentially saved the game.Courtesy of Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY SportsIn the top of the tenth we saw another big play that won\xe2\x80\x99t be remembered. Following a lead off single by Adam Jones, Nolan Reimold grounded into what appeared to be a double-play. However Jones slid hard into second causing just a bit of hesitation on the part of the second baseman, turning a double-play into a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice. Reimold would move to second on a ground out, and would then score on Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single. With Jim Johnson on for the save, Alex Aybar grounded out to record the final out in the tenth, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a 5-4 extra-innings win in which they battled their own demons\xe2\x80\xa6and won.This was a huge win for the Birds because one would have had to wonder where the team was psychologically had they lost after leading most of the way. It also showed that this team is about as resilient as they come; with Davis out of the lineup with an injury, it was his replacement at first base (Steve Pearce) who drove in the winning run. Perhaps had Davis been in the lineup he would have hit another homer earlier in the game off of Hanson (who was serving it up to everyone it seemed) and this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even been an issue, however the fact is that the Birds managed to fight themselves and the Angels off and find a way to win under adverse conditions. The 0-for-10 clip with RISP is concerning, however if they were only going to hit once with a runner in scoring position, Pearce picked the right time to do it.The O\xe2\x80\x99s have already guaranteed themselves a winning road trip by winning yesterday, however they\xe2\x80\x99ll attempt to make it a winning road trip at 7-4 with a win this afternoon which would also give them three-of-four in LA. They\xe2\x80\x99ll have Jason Hammel on the mound this afternoon, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Jerome Williams (who\xe2\x80\x99s making his first start of 2013).

The clubs are like roommates sharing a space that one had long occupied. They must make delicate calculations about how far they can go in marketing without intruding on the other\'s turf.It doesn\'t help that the franchises can\'t agree on how much more money the Nationals should receive in annual rights fees from the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN), which televises both teams\' games. The issue has been unsettled for more than a year, and neither team will comment on it.The dispute was predictable, given how the network\'s ownership is structured, said John Mansell, a sports media consultant from Great Falls, Va. The Orioles were given a majority stake in MASN after owner Peter G. Angelos argued that in order to remain viable, his club would need to recoup the money lost with the emergence of a second team in Baltimore\'s commercial territory. One club controlling another club\'s network, Mansell said, ""was a recipe for disaster.""The rights-fee dispute remains under advisement by baseball commissioner Bud Selig.Major League Baseball also oversees the clubs\' marketing territories. The Orioles and Nationals, who will play each other four times in late May, seem to have more flexibility to promote themselves across the region than their NFL counterparts \xe2\x80\x94 the Ravens and Washington Redskins.In a 2004 agreement, the NFL divided the state into Ravens ""purple"" and Redskins ""burgundy."" The Redskins were given exclusive rights to Montgomery and Prince George\'s counties; the Ravens got the rest.The NFL\'s boundaries apply to sales or promotions using team symbols and cover everything from team-related pizza-topping giveaways to billboards and mailed solicitations. But the lines don\'t always work. In 2006, John Ziemann, president of the Ravens marching band, received a Redskins season-ticket solicitation at his Harford County home. So did a Ravens executive.""I thought, \'They\'re barking up the wrong tree with this boy,\' "" Ziemann said.The Redskins told The Balltimore Sun that the flier was sent to the county inadvertently. The team said the mailing, coordinated by a Redskins sponsor, was supposed to have been sorted to exclude Ravens-area addresses.If Major League Baseball has carved out marketing territories \xe2\x80\x94 and it says it has \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s not sharing them publicly.When the Nationals, after 36 seasons as the Montreal Expos, arrived in Washington for the 2005 season, MLB said the team\'s operating territory would be defined in the Major League Baseball Constitution, the occasionally amended governing agreement among the 30 clubs. At the time of the Nationals\' move, the document defined the Orioles\' territory as the city of Baltimore and the counties of Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Howard and Harford. It did not include Washington, even though the Orioles then had a retail store there.MLB declined to explain the reasoning or provide an updated document.Washington\'s natural marketing territory, which includes rapidly growing Northern Virginia, dwarfs Baltimore\'s in population. Washington\'s ""designated market area,"" which measures television households, is the nation\'s eighth-largest. ""That\'s a huge marketplace,"" Feffer said.Baltimore\'s TV market was 27th in the 2011-2012 rankings.""The Nats are a team on the rise in the bigger market,"" said Mike Reynolds, news editor for Multichannel News, a trade magazine and website. Given that, he said, it\'s ""pretty unique"" that they are a ""subset"" of the regional sports network broadcasting their games.Angelos could not be reached for comment last week. He told The Baltimore Sun in 2008 that MASN was structured ""to save this franchise from competition introduced immediately in its backyard.""1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

05/07/2013,"[(""The Baltimore Orioles' Mental Health Program - Camden Chat"", ' First, I want to say kudos to Jake Arrieta for speaking openly about his anxiety issues. The Associated Press article about Jake\'s demotion carries several mentions of his mental state:   ""Jake Arrieta couldn\'t get his mind right on the mound \xe2\x80\xa6""   ""[Buck Showalter and I] talked about high anxiety situations and he pretty much asked me, \'Why do you have high anxiety in any situation with the stuff you have?\' "" Arrieta said. ""Basically, I told him that I just want to be what my team needs me to be. Sometimes I create the anxiety for myself. So I just need to limit that.""  ""I let previous instances creep up in my thought process sometimes,"" [Arrieta] said. ""I think that\'s where things go awry and that\'s where the walks come in."" Showalter said, ""The thing [Jake\'s] got to solve is the mental side of it.""  Struggling to throw strikes on the mound in front of 35,000 screaming fans can\'t be easy, especially when nothing is visibly wrong with you. And although some high-profile players (Zack Greinke, Joey Votto, John Smoltz, etc.) have dealt with anxiety and depression in full public view, we are still a long way from a culture in which ballplayers feel as comfortable discussing their mental struggles as they do their swing mechanics or strength conditioning routines. Why not? Well, there are a variety of reasons. But the main one is that baseball players are male. Speaking as a guy, we all know we\'re not the most forthcoming with our thoughts and feelings. Since we were young, many of us have been socialized to believe not only that talking about our feelings is a feminine characteristic, but also that femininity is equivalent to physical weakness. No man, especially not competitive ballplayers, wants to be accused of being weak. Votto implies as much when talking about his struggles:     [My biggest hesitation was] coming out and letting people know, letting my teammates know [about my depression]. We\'re supposed to be known as mentally tough and able to withstand any type of adversity.     Former major-leaguer Bob Tewksbury, now a sports psychologist, might agree:  Anytime someone says \'psychology,\' [players] say \'Oh my God. I can\'t talk to him because it\'s sign of weakness!\' That\'s permeated our culture a little bit, particularly with males in our world.     Even some teams avoid talking about the mental health aspects of their staff. For example, the O\'s list the team orthopedist and dentist on their web page, but not anyone associated with their mental health program. Yet we know that they have such a program. In early 2012, Dan Duquette hired Seth Kaplan as their Director of Mental Training. Kaplan has an M.Ed. in Counseling Psychology with a specialization in Sports Psychology. He works for Elite Performance Coaching (actually, its web site hints that he may be EPC) and helps the Orioles\' pitchers with ""mental toughness""  training. As Duquette said at the time of the hiring:  The idea is to help [our pitchers] prepare mentally to prepare physically. It\'s a key component.  Some more research turns up the name David McDuff, M.D., who is the Team Psychiatrist for the Baltimore Orioles (and the Ravens). He\'s written several books that you can find online, but there\'s a paper on his website that distills his philosophies. It\'s a mental toughness training (there\'s those words again!) manual for baseball players. It talks about thinking like a winner, setting goals (like hitting 10 more home runs or walking one fewer batter per game), establishing a routine, regulating your intensity, and building a team. (Side note: notice how the talk of sports psychology is couched in terms of mental ""toughess."" Votto, Kaplan, and McDuff all use that phrase.) I can only speculate as to whether Arrieta used Kaplan\'s or McDuff\'s services. He hasn\'t gone on the DL for anxiety issues, but we know that he spoke with at least one sports psychologist (former major-league pitcher Don Carman) in August 2012, when he was last in AAA. It\'s simplistic to conclude that because Jake is still struggling, something is wrong with either him or the mental health professional(s) he has seen. That\'s not the entire picture. His teammates (and manager) bear some responsibility for creating a clubhouse culture that Jake feels comfortable discussing his struggles in. Baseball as a whole bears some responsibility for spreading this kind of culture to other teams. The fans and the media also bear aspects of this responsibility. I\'m not saying we need to baby him. Jake needs to be held accountable for performing his chosen job well, as do we all. But you\'d be surprised what benefits a culture of open communication can have. Sometimes simply feeling like you can talk about your struggles openly is a key to making the struggles disappear. It seems the Orioles acknowledge the need for mental health professionals on staff, which is a great start.

There was rain after all, and the game was delayed for a time, but the most meaningful rain came in the form of a pair of doubles by Matt Wieters, including the decisive tie-breaking run in the bottom of the 8th inning to power the Orioles to a 4-3 victory in the opening game of the series against the Royals. The game was neither the cleanest nor the most interesting ever played, but a win is a win. Things started off well for the Orioles, plating three runs in the first inning as they brought an end to a 13-inning scoreless streak by Ervin Santana. He was not sharp, and the Orioles took advantage with three straight singles by Manny Machado, Nick Markakis, and Adam Jones. Jones drove in the first run and Wieters drove in the others. The double by Wieters would be the last baserunner that the O\'s would get until there were two outs in the fifth inning, and Santana never looked vulnerable again. On the other hand, there was Wei-Yin Chen, who never looked great, but always did just enough to stave off the damage, mostly thanks to getting bailed out by some sharp plays from the left side of his infield. Machado and J.J. Hardy each earned some highlight reel time in the process of getting three double plays started. Chen would scatter nine hits over 6.1 IP before the 48-minute rain delay chased him from the game. He\'d thrown only 80 pitches and may have been able to notch a rare seven-inning start for an Orioles starter, but Mother Nature said it was not to be so.    Chen did not walk a batter and struck out two. When the rains came, Miguel Tejada - who is still in baseball, I was shocked to find out, and is batting .368/.400/.421 after this game - was on first base. The monsoon arrived out of nowhere, drenching the field before they could even call play, even blowing rain into the press box. After the rain stopped, Brian Matusz took the mound. You might think you like Matusz against a lefty, but then, that\'s what we thought in the playoffs last year too, in ALDS game 3.    Despite lefties coming in with a .091 average against Matusz, Alex Gordon smacked a pitch onto the flag court. It was the textbook example of a pitcher missing his spot and a professional hitter making him pay. This tied the score at 3-3, after the Royals had scratched out a run on three singles in the third inning. The inherited runner was the first that Matusz had allowed to score since he was moved into the bullpen last year. This took both starters out of the game without a chance to be the pitcher of record. Santana gave up seven hits over his six innings of work, with three earned runs, one walk, and four strikeouts.    The 7th inning stretch followed. The Orioles used the occasion to honor long-time usher Charles ""Zillbilly"" Zill, who passed away recently due to cancer. You might recognize Zill as the usher who would don overalls and bring out an orange fiddle to dance around during Thank God I\'m A Country Boy. He was a fixture of Orioles games since 1997, and now he will grace Camden Yards with his presence no longer. Nate McLouth tried to get something started in the bottom of the 7th inning, drawing a walk with one out and then stealing second base, but Machado and Markakis could not drive him in. That didn\'t matter to the Orioles, with Jones opening up the bottom of the 8th with a rare walk - though it was his third consecutive game with a walk. Royals reliever Tim Collins tried to pick Jones off and instead threw the ball away, putting Jones on second. Chris Davis struck out looking - the pitch was a strike, but plate umpire Dale Scott irked Davis with a very delayed call, and that brought up the hero of the day, Wieters, would have to bat left-handed against the Kansas City equivalent of Brian Matusz (in disappointing pitching prospect terms) in Luke Hochevar. Wieters has looked like absolute garbage left-handed, but he got two hits today, slicing a crucial double down the left field line to score Jones. Why would you play lefty-Wieters to slice the ball down the line? You wouldn\'t, because he is a big, strong man. But when he does slice the ball down the line, even he can cruise into second base, and Jones cruised home, and that was enough for tonight. Jim Johnson pitched a 1-2-3 inning, drama-free, against the bottom of the Royals lineup, to notch his 12th save of the season. He has more saves than three teams have wins. The Orioles have a 20-13 record and are the farthest above .500 that they have been all season and, following a Boston loss, are one game back in the American League East. Wednesday\'s weather forecast currently looks as dodgy as did today\'s, but the Orioles and Royals are scheduled to continue the series at 7:05. Chris Tillman will get the start for the Orioles as Luis Mendoza starts for the Royals. A couple of post-game notes, hot off the presses from the Orioles: * Since July 29, 2012, the Orioles\' 61-33 record is the best in baseball, as is their home record (31-13) in that time. * McLouth has safely reached base in 30 of his last  64 plate appearances. * The Orioles are now 8-3 in the first game of a series.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles\\u2019 Manny Machado Shows Maturity On And Off Field ...', ' BALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 In his first full season in the majors, Manny Machado has proven to be quite adept on the field and very comfortable being the youngest player in the Baltimore Orioles clubhouse. The 20-year-old Machado is batting .309 with five homers and 21 RBIs, along with three steals in three attempts.\xc2\xa0 At third base, he\xe2\x80\x99s scooping up slow-rolling dribblers with his bare hand and throwing quickly and accurately to first base despite having less than a year of experience at the position. \xe2\x80\x9cHe fits right into the makeup of this team,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles center fielder Adam Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen he picks up that bat, he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to hit. When he puts his glove on, he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to field. He plays the game hard. You can see his poise.\xe2\x80\x9d Machado, the third overall pick in the 2010 draft, made his big league debut last year after being recalled from Double-A Bowie in August. Originally a shortstop, he solidified Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s infield with sound play at the hot corner and batted .262 to help the Orioles reach the postseason for the first time since 1997. During the offseason, Machado worked hard to make sure this year would be even better. His regimen included honing his ping pong skills, which goes a long way toward explaining his innate attention to detail. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew that everybody here in this clubhouse likes to play ping pong, so I came prepared for spring training,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to work on everything that\xe2\x80\x99s going to come your way during the year, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s ping pong or baseball, because up here you see a lot of crazy things. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be ready for everything.\xe2\x80\x9d Machado and teammate Steve Pearce, who\xe2\x80\x99s 10 years his senior, have waged many a battle at the ping pong table before games at Camden Yards. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s very competitive. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be competitive to play major league baseball,\xe2\x80\x9d Pearce said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s only 20, but whether he\xe2\x80\x99s playing ping pong or on the baseball field, he digs in. He\xe2\x80\x99s had some huge hits for the team and he\xe2\x80\x99s playing lights out at third base.\xe2\x80\x9d Machado made only five errors in 51 games last season, and this season his fielding percentage is up to .980 from .967. Working alongside Gold Glove shortstop J.J. Hardy, the duo has created a virtual seal on the left side of the infield. \xe2\x80\x9cI said last year that I was impressed with the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s so young, the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s so aware of everything that\xe2\x80\x99s going on around him and the fact that he made that transition to third base as easily as he has,\xe2\x80\x9d Hardy said. Machado also made an easy adjustment to batting second in the lineup, which usually requires him to move up the leadoff hitter or get on base ahead of sluggers Nick Markakis, Jones and Chris Davis. Machado has a .352 on-base percentage and ranks third on the team with 23 runs. And when the team needs a long ball, he often delivers \xe2\x80\x94 his two-run drive Sunday put the Orioles ahead to stay in an 8-4 win over the Angels that sealed an uplifting 7-4 swing through Oakland, Seattle and Los Angeles. \xe2\x80\x9cThe situation dictates what you need to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see from him is still to be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d Hardy said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think really the sky\xe2\x80\x99s the limit. He could be a 3-hole guy later in his career. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to get a lot of at-bats hitting in the 2-hole this year, and I think it will be good for him and good for the team.\xe2\x80\x9d Machado has started all 32 games this year and has been a key contributor to Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 19-13 start. He has at least one hit in 13 of his last 14 games and has been held hitless only seven times \xe2\x80\x94 never in consecutive games. \xe2\x80\x9cYou try to simplify this game. You can\xe2\x80\x99t be thinking too much, beating yourself up if you go 0 for 4,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are 162 games. Some days you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have it, some days not. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I see it. If you give 100 percent and try to help your team win, everything is going to fall into place.\xe2\x80\x9d His maturity belies his age, but Machado\xe2\x80\x99s teammates won\xe2\x80\x99t let him forget that he won\xe2\x80\x99t be 21 until July 6. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we drink on the team plane, he can\xe2\x80\x99t have alcohol,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe make sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d Even after he reaches the legal drinking age, Machado will still be the youngest player in the clubhouse. \xe2\x80\x9cThey call me `The Baby,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x98 he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m still a kid to them.\xe2\x80\x9d (Copyright 2013 by The Associated Press.

On this occasion, they were quite content to get the pivotal run via a walk, an errant pickoff throw and a well-placed fly ball. Matt Wieters drove in three runs, including the tiebreaker in the eighth inning, and the Orioles beat the Kansas City Royals 4-3 Tuesday night on a soggy night at Camden Yards. After blowing a three-run lead, the Orioles went back on top in the eighth. Adam Jones drew a leadoff walk from Tim Collins (1-1) and advanced when Luke Hochevar threw wildly to first base on a pickoff attempt. Wieters then lofted an opposite-field fly to left that appeared to hit the foul line for a double. \xe2\x80\x9cI was hoping,\xe2\x80\x9d Wieters said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was leaning it and I was pretty excited when the umpire made the fair signal.\xe2\x80\x9d The Orioles came into the game with 39 home runs, including 17 that gave them the lead and four that tied it.

The Royals, on the other hand, got a huge home run from Alex Gordon. But they were done in by a walk and an error. \xe2\x80\x9cThe leadoff walk is something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to get you in trouble just about every time, especially late in the game,\xe2\x80\x9d Kansas City manager Ned Yost said. Tommy Hunter (2-1) worked 1 1-3 innings of relief and Jim Johnson got three straight outs for his 12th save. It was the fourth win in five games for the Orioles, who moved within a game of first-place Boston in the AL East. \xe2\x80\x9cThis team grinds it out,\xe2\x80\x9d Hunter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis team is fun to watch for everybody. Nobody should ever leave the stadium, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that much, under any circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d Even on a brisk, wet night. Baltimore starter Wei-Yin Chen had a 3-1 lead in the seventh inning when rain forced a 48-minute delay. After play resumed, Brian Matusz got an out before yielding a two-run homer to Gordon. Chen allowed two runs and nine hits in 6 1-3 innings. Ervin Santana gave up three runs and seven hits in six innings for Kansas City. The right-hander walked one and struck out four. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst inning I was always in trouble, but after that I settled down and threw a lot of strikes and blew guys away,\xe2\x80\x9d Santana said. Baltimore went up 3-0 in the first. Singles by Manny Machado, Nick Markakis and Adam Jones produced a run before Wieters hit a two-out, two-run double. \xe2\x80\x9cI missed that one. He hit a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d Santana said. In the third, former Oriole Miguel Tejada hit a one-out single and scored on a single by Alcides Escobar. In the bottom half, Tejada made a diving stop of Jones\xe2\x80\x99 grounder to third and made a successful throw to first while in a sitting position. Hardy saved a run with a sparkling dive-and-throw play in the fourth. With two outs and a runner on second, Hardy went to the edge of the outfield grass to snare a grounder by Salvador Perez before throwing to first while on his knees. Santana regrouped from his shaky start to retire 12 straight batters until Nate McLouth singled with two outs in the fifth. Machado followed with a single before Markakis hit a fly to left. NOTES: The Orioles will probably move RHP Miguel Gonzalez back from his scheduled Wednesday start because of a blister on his thumb. \xe2\x80\xa6 Santana\xe2\x80\x99s streak of 13 consecutive scoreless innings ended abruptly in the first. \xe2\x80\xa6 Baltimore 2B Brian Roberts, who\xe2\x80\x99s been on the DL since April 5 with a right hamstring strain, still isn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling right and will visit Dr. Daniel Cooper in Dallas for a second opinion. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s moving at the pace he was hoping,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\xa6 Royals RHP Luis Mendoza (0-1, 7.00 ERA) vies for his first win of the season on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 Chris Tillman (2-1, 3.63) will start for the Orioles.

05/08/2013,"[('California Love, Orioles style - Camden Chat, a Baltimore ...', "" Any domestic travel I do, I always prefer to work in a trip to a baseball stadium I haven't seen yet.  So when my sister's college graduation near Los Angeles came up, of course, I pondered the possibility of catching a Dodgers or Angels game.  It was only when I took a look at their schedules that I found out that the Orioles were playing that very same weekend in Anaheim.  And when my wife suggested that we make the trip into a full-blown California road trip, starting out in San Francisco -- lo and behold, the Orioles would also be playing in Oakland the weekend we'd be up there.  And so, what could've been a fairly simple family obligation became a chance to see my team on the road, in two new-to-me ballparks. Orioles @ Athletics, 4/27  We sat a few sections down from the visitors' dugout to take in an Orioles 7-3 victory on a nice Saturday afternoon when the A's were celebrating the anniversary of their last World Series win.  Contrary to the popular perception (which is most likely due to Raiders' fans antics), the Athletics' fans were great - they clearly knew their team, and I got a lot of good-natured crap, but no meaningful heckling.  In fact, the whole Oakland-San Fransisco divide reminds me of DC-Baltimore in a lot of ways.  San Fran is the bigger market, the more cosmopolitan of the two, and seems more nationally recognizable, but Oakland is the grittier market with its own rabid fanbase and lots of history.  There are two key failures in comparison, of course -- the Giants and A's are both storied franchises, whereas the Nats are new kids in town; and in the DC-Baltimore divide, the smaller market has the better park as a draw.  The latter is decidedly NOT the case in Oakland. The O.co Coliseum deserves every bit of its shabby reputation.  The park is surrounded by an old-style ocean of stadium-owned parking lots, not integrated into a neighborhood at all.  You walk through tomblike concrete tunnels as you enter the park, and when you finally get to the seating area, you still don't really feel like you're in a baseball park.  It's so clear that you're in an aging, multipurpose facility, that you can never really forget it.  The A's put tarps over the 400-level seats to make the park feel less empty (and those tarps don't even come off during a sellout, like the game I was at), but really they have the opposite effect.  The stadium has two tiny jumbotrons above those empty sections, which are pretty hard to see.  The Oakland fans deserve better.  I hope Oakland, San Francisco and MLB can come to some kind of accord to get the A's their own park soon, whether it's in San Jose, downtown Oakland or somewhere else. The one area where the A's have improved the fan experience in the Coliseum is the concessions - on the main concourse, unique food offerings and selections from local breweries abound.  It was fun to stroll through and take in all the choices before deciding what to eat and drink.  Having a draft New Belgium Ranger IPA while taking in a game on a hot spring day is a pleasure that can't be overstated.    Orioles @ Angels, 5/3  After meeting up with my family in the LA area, we all headed out to Angels Stadium to witness an ugly 4-0 shutout where the Orioles' hitters were baffled all night by the likes of Jason Vargas, then proceeded to make my night all the more miserable with baserunning and defensive miscues, even though the game was lost regardless of those mental slip-ups.  Angels fans turned out well for this game, which came in the midst of a span of several unseasonably hot days in SoCal.  They were universally friendly to me and my family, even with most of us in Orioles garb.  There was a more noticeable smattering of Orioles fans here than there had been in Oakland, too.    Oakland versus Anaheim is a contrast study in stadiums.  Angels Stadium is also a 1960s multipurpose bowl surrounded by a sea of parking lots, but Anaheim has really made the most of their situation, with the park undergoing major renovations in the late 1990s and feeling every bit like a real ballpark now, with some open-air views in center field, enclosed bullpens past the left field wall, and pleasant open-air concourses.  Also the exact opposite of Oakland, though, the concessions at Anaheim need some major work.  In the upper deck, the beer selections consisted of Bud Light, Coors Light, Pacifico, Modelo and Third Shift Amber Lager, a faux-craft beer from MillerCoors.  It was enough to make a beer snob grumpy (which isn't a tough feat, I know).  Food selections were slightly better, with odd choices like Panda Express and Jack in the Box smattered around the park in addition to standard ballpark fare.   General lessons from my west coast Orioles experience Never, ever get in a line with me Not only do I always pick the worst concession line possible -- you know, the one with a slow, surly cashier and the guy ordering food for a group of 20 -- but I also do so at the most inopportune times.  In the two games I attended, five home runs were hit.  I was in my seat for one of them.    The Orioles should take me with them all the time The Orioles struggled mightily in Anaheim and Oakland last year, going a combined 3-7 in those parks.  The birds just took three of four in both series I attended, whereas they dropped two of three in Seattle, the only west coast stop where I wasn't with the team.  Let's ignore the fact that the team only went 1-1 in the games where I was actually present, and conclude that the Orioles should fly me around the country with the team, as a good luck charm, at least as an experiment for the rest of this season. ...But if they do, they should hire more trainers Taylor Teagarden landed on the DL following the game I attended in Oakland.  Chris Davis left the game in Anaheim after tweaking his knee (but thankfully, has avoided the DL).  If we run with the idea that correlation is causation, and my attendance can actually affect things, this is not a good track record. Fireworks at ballparks can be fun Most fireworks nights I've been to at ballparks have left me unimpressed.  The shows are usually short, and they make the fans move around and crush into a small section of the seating bowl.  The Angels did this right, setting off a huge display out past center field, which fans could see from anywhere in the park, and they choreographed the whole show to a variety of music quite well.   Driving down the Pacific Coast Highway in a convertible is awesome This has absolutely nothing to do with the baseball portion of my trip, but it's true.  I highly recommend it.    "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""O's 5, Royals 3: That'll do, team. That'll do. - Camden Chat"", "" This is not the kind of game that'll win anyone any awards, but it's the kind of quick, solid win that Orioles fans are suddenly coming to expect.  An adequate outing from Chris Tillman, a lockdown bullpen, and just enough offense let the Orioles cruise to a 5-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals that seemed shockingly easy -- maybe because the Royals made it easy, maybe because this team is finding ways to get just enough done most nights. Chris Tillman, as Orioles fans have come to expect, didn't overpower the other team by any means, but he put in six respectable innings, allowing three earned runs for the quality start and the win.  It actually wasn't the runs that did Tillman in for the night - they came off of home runs, mistake pitches to Alex Gordon and Mike Moustakas that I could easily forgive since Tillman was pitching with a lead for the whole night.  No, what limited Tillman's outing was walks to the likes of George Kottaras and Lorenzo Cain, and taking way too many batters to three-ball counts.  When Tillman pitched like a pitcher with a lead, he was inducing mostly weak contact (HRs excepted) and going through quick at-bats.  But at other times (the second and fourth innings especially), Tillman seemed not to trust his stuff and became his own worst enemy. Fortunately, the Orioles hitters had some decent nights and capitalized on every Kansas City mistake aggressively.  The scoring started with a two-run home run, drilled into the left-field seats by J.J. Hardy and scoring Matt Wieters.  If this seems like an unlikely cast of characters for the Orioles this year, it is - and that can only be seen as a good thing, that the Orioles could put up a five-spot while Adam Jones and Chris Davis went a combined 1-for-7 with no extra bases. The Orioles really put themselves over the top when the Royals came unraveled in the fifth inning and forgot how to throw a baseball for about ten minutes.  Chris Dickerson started things off with a clean double, but things took a turn for the bizarre when Nate McLouth hit a grounder to short.  Alcides Escobar tried to snare Dickerson at third, but made a terrible throw that hit Dickerson in the foot, putting runners on first and third with none out.  McLouth took off successfully for second with Manny Machado at the plate, and moments later Machado plated Dickerson with a clean single.  Machado took a cue from McLouth and took off running, and Kottaras bounced a poor throw to second base.  McLouth alertly broke for home, and another poor throw let him score easily, and let Machado scramble to third.  Just as quickly, Machado scored on a wild pitch.  The bizarre sequence led to three runs in all, giving the Orioles a 5-1 lead they wouldn't relinquish, even though our old friend Bruce Chen held the Orioles scoreless for the last two innings.    The bullpen did its usual thing, locking down a narrow lead for three innings and getting the job done.  Troy Patton, Darren O'Day, Brian Matusz and Jim Johnson allowed just a few baserunners and no earned runs.  The closest thing to a threat came in the eighth, when O'Day logged two strikeouts but then gave up a weak infield single and hit Cain with a pitch.  Fortunately, after letting an inherited runner score last night for the first time in quite a while, Matusz regained his old ways and put out the fire with a single pitch to Moustakas, a pop out to Matt Wieters. Jim Johnson allowed an infield single to Elliot Johnson, but then logged a quick double play and struck out Jarrod Dyson to end the game.  And just like that, the Orioles find themselves at 21-13, with the potential to be tied for the AL East lead if Minnesota finishes the beatdown they're currently administering to the Red Sox.  This appears to be Birdland.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""Orioles' Roberts to have surgery - birdswatcher.com"", 'Prior to this evening\xe2\x80\x99s game with Kansas City, the Baltimore Orioles announced that second baseman Brian Roberts would be having surgery on his right hamstring. Roberts is expected to be able to resume baseball related activities in about six weeks, at which time he\xe2\x80\x99ll report to Sarasota. If they need an extra spot on the 40-man r0ster, the Orioles could opt to transfer Roberts to the 60-day DL. To my knowledge, that\xe2\x80\x99s not being done right away (only if needed).Courtesy of Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsThis is undoubtedly a tough pill to swallow for Roberts, who at 35 is in the final year of his contract. As of right now the Birds are expected to continue platooning Ryan Flaherty and Alexi Casilla at second base until Roberts is able to return. The good news is that he is expected to be back this year if that timetable is any indication.A lot of Orioles fans are expressing increasing frustration with this situation, as Roberts has only played in 118 games in the past four years. Furthermore, many people seem to cringe when they see Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s name in the lineup because that means he\xe2\x80\x99ll be coming to the plate. Let me start by addressing the Roberts situation; this is a guy that\xe2\x80\x99s meant a lot to the organization over the past 10-12 years. It certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t his fault that he keeps getting injured, especially this time when he pulled up lame on an attempted stolen base in the third game of the season. While it appears he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccollected a paycheck\xe2\x80\x9d over the past four years, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly a fair statement. This is a guy that\xe2\x80\x99s worked hard each time to get back into playing shape, only to have something else happen. It\xe2\x80\x99s really easy for people to suggest that \xe2\x80\x9che should give money back\xe2\x80\x9d to the organization. Who among us would sincerely consider doing that? (I can tell you one writer who I know would not.)Courtesy of Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY SportsAs for Flaherty, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to look at his batting average (.118 coming into tonight) and say that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in the lineup or on the team. And that in and of itself might be a legitimate point. However Flaherty also has a 1.000 fielding percentage on the year. Again, I agree that the sub-Mendoza Line batting average is tough to justify. However an infielder with a glove that sure is a tough thing to find. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that throughout his career Mark Belanger hit .228 for his entire 18-year big league career. However he fielded at a .977 clip. Defense counts for just as much as offense, and that\xe2\x80\x99s true in all sports. In no way am I comparing Flaherty to Belanger, however if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a superior glove would he have been in the lineup everyday with that average? .228 is a far cry from .118, however the point is that Flaherty is in the lineup for his glove.While the Roberts news appears a bit sorrowful, the good news is that as I said above it appears that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be back this year. Does that mean that Flaherty is sent down when that happens? All things being equal, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance that could be the case. However who knows what the situation is when Roberts is ready to return.

A comedy of errors ensued, and the Orioles escaped with a 5-3 victory Wednesday night despite allowing two home runs and getting only five hits. J.J. Hardy homered and Manny Machado scored a run and hit an RBI single for the Orioles, whose season-high fourth consecutive win moved them eight games over .500 (21-13) for the first time this year. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re playing good baseball right now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hardy, whose two-run drive in the second inning put Baltimore ahead for good. But the game was decided in the fifth, when the Orioles went up 5-1 with a three-run uprising fueled by three Kansas City errors and a wild pitch. After Chris Dickerson hit a leadoff double, shortstop Alcides Escobar grabbed Nate McLouth\xe2\x80\x99s sharp grounder and tried to get Dickerson at third, but the throw hit Dickerson to put runners at the corners. McLouth promptly stole second, and Machado followed with a single to bring home Dickerson. Machado then stole second, and McLouth came home after Escobar couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle the poor throw from catcher George Kottaras. Escobar\xe2\x80\x99s throw home was also off target, allowing Machado to take third, and he scored when starter Luis Mendoza uncorked a wild pitch. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we can pick up on errors like that, it\xe2\x80\x99s huge,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat brings up the momentum for us and brings it down for them. That\xe2\x80\x99s baseball.\xe2\x80\x9d The way Royals manager Ned Yost saw it, the first bad throw laid the groundwork for the miscues that followed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe key to that inning was if Escy just takes the out at first, they only get one run,\xe2\x80\x9d Yost said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe tried to make a play, tried to keep it close to him by going to third. He just threw low and hit him in the back of the spike and that got a rally going. Now you got (runners at) first and third instead of just a runner at third.\xc2\xa0 Then they start taking off and everything falls apart.\xe2\x80\x9d Escobar lamented both his poor throws, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that I made stupid errors like that.\xe2\x80\x9d Baltimore has been outhit in each of its past three games, including 7-5 in this one. The Orioles are 3-6 when outhit by their opponent. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, at the end of the day, it\xe2\x80\x99s whoever scores the most runs, so we made key hits today,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had key hits from J.J. on that home run. Myself driving in that run. . Our goal is to get on base and get deep into counts and bring in those runs when they get on.\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Tillman (3-1) allowed three runs and five hits in six innings to win his third straight start. The right-hander came in 0-2 with a 10.93 ERA in three career starts against the Royals. Troy Patton pitched the seventh, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Brian Matusz worked the eighth and Jim Johnson got three outs for his 13th save. Johnson has converted 34 straight save opportunities, tying the club record set by Randy Myers in 1997. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good, obviously, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a secondary goal of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously winning the game is always the first objective.\xe2\x80\x9d Alex Gordon hit his second home run in two games and Mike Moustakas went 3 for 4 with a homer for Kansas City. Mendoza (0-2) gave up five runs, three earned, and five hits in six innings. Baltimore took a 2-0 lead in the second when Matt Wieters led off with a single and Hardy followed with a drive just inside the left-field foul pole. It was his sixth home run of the season, the third in four games. Mendoza didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow another base runner until Hardy drew a two-out walk in the fourth. Tillman blanked the Royals on two hits through four innings, then retired the first two batters in the fifth before Gordon homered to right. That ended Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s run of consecutive scoreless innings at 15, a streak that began on April 27 in Oakland. NOTES: Orioles 2B Brian Roberts will have surgery on his right hamstring Thursday, a procedure that will keep him sidelined at least an additional six weeks. He\xe2\x80\x99s been on the disabled list since April 5. \xe2\x80\xa6 Royals RHP Jeremy Guthrie (4-0) will face his former team for the first time Thursday night in the series finale.

05/11/2013,"[('Orioles 5, Twins 8: Wading into the quicksand - Camden Chat', "" Quicksand is something that has a lot of depth. The problem is that when you experience that depth, you're dead. You are pulled under the surface, sand will fill your lungs, and you will die messily. The same concept applies to the Orioles starting pitching depth this season. Yes, they have depth. We heard all about how Norfolk would be stacked with people waiting in the wings. None of them are any good. That's why they're in Norfolk. This is all relevant to tonight's game because the latest example of that pitching depth to come up and have a bad start is Steve Johnson, who made his 2013 debut in becoming the 9th player to start a game for the Orioles through only 37 games. Johnson was one of the surprise stories from last year's stretch run. The magic stayed in last September. He was fooling no one tonight. He could not locate pitches, gave up four walks and seven hits while pitching only four innings and giving up six runs. That's not going to cut it for long. Johnson may not even survive on the roster for long after this recap is posted. Two straight four-inning starts will eat up the bullpen. An 8-5 loss is the result of such things. That Johnson was so bad is unfortunate, because he pitched against Vance Worley tonight, who also was not any good. Worley was just slightly better, an impressive and sad feat when considering that Worley failed the Brian Matusz ERA Test (end a start with a lower ERA than you began) despite beginning with a 6.95 ERA. He also got the win while giving up eleven hits and five runs.    The Orioles would take a 3-0 lead before the Twins even came up to bat in the game. When you get four straight hits, including two doubles, that kind of thing can happen. Manny Machado doubled, Nick Markakis singled in the run. Then Adam Jones doubled to put men on second and third - it's a little sad Markakis didn't score, but whatever. Chris Davis plated the second run on a single, then was thrown out at second after Jones scored the third run on a Matt Wieters sacrifice fly. Perhaps the most frustrating three-run inning on the basepaths imaginable.    Unfortunately for the Orioles, Johnson had a bad third inning and a worse fourth inning. Joe Mauer drove in a run with a double and Justin Morneau later singled home Mauer in the third. In the fourth, Johnson gave up an infield single, got two outs, and this sequence happened: walk (to the #9 hitter), double (two runs score, game tied), intentional walk (to Mauer), walk, single (two runs score). Throw strikes! You're Steve Johnson. If you can't throw strikes, there is no point to your existence on the roster, and indeed, he may not grace it for much longer if they need an extra bullpen arm for a few days with T.J. McFarland and Tommy Hunter both having thrown for over two innings in Friday night's game.    The score was 6-4 after Johnson was chased after only the four innings. The O's chipped away a little more at Worley in the sixth, starting with Ryan Flaherty being hit by a pitch. Nolan Reimold recorded a rare hit for an O's DH, putting two men on base. Flaherty advanced to third on a Nate McLouth sacrifice fly and scored on a Machado single, making the score 6-5. Manny is awesome. He had three hits on the day and is now batting .323/.363/.513. Markakis, despite a two-hit game, is not awesome, or at least wasn't in the sixth inning, snuffing out the rally by grounding into a 4-6-3 double play. He persists in having a lower OPS than Steve Pearce. When you have to get two innings out of Troy Patton, bad things may happen. Tonight, they did. Patton breezed through one inning, but then gave up a single to Mauer with two outs in his second inning of work. Patton then left a belt-high fastball out over the plate, and Ryan Doumit, he of the kinda-freaky totally black eyes, crushed a second-deck shot into left field. The ball was gone in a hurry, which isn't easy to pull off in Target Field. The 8-5 score after that home run would hold to the end of the game. Mauer did the most damage to the Orioles, reaching base four times and scoring three. Morneau drove in three runs as part of a 3-4 night. The O's were no slouches for offense either, with Markakis and Wieters also adding multi-hit nights - Wieters scored the fourth run with a solo homer. 3-10 with runners in scoring position is about where you want, but they could not get enough runs to overcome Johnson and then Patton's efforts today. O's relievers had thrown the fourth-most innings in the AL heading into today and had to throw another four today. That is the kind of thing that will start to be a problem in a hurry. Brian Matusz and Pedro Strop each chipped in a scoreless inning,. Strop's got no place in a close game the Orioles are winning, but seems to be the ideal mop-up man for a game where things are out of hand one way or another. Tomorrow brings the rubber game of the series, with Wei-Yin Chen of the Orioles scheduled to face off against Scott Diamond of the Twins. The game starts at 2:10 and hopefully the Orioles will win for your moms.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: The comeback kids - Birds Watcher', 'When you go down 6-0 in any baseball game I suppose it would be normal for feelings of doubt to creep into one\xe2\x80\x99s head. Incidentally that\xe2\x80\x99s how teams get their name dragged through the mud. Granted it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if you lose a ballgame 1-0, 6-0, or 12-0; you still lose. However when teams begin to entertain those feelings of doubt that\xe2\x80\x99s how things go from bad to worse, and you go from being down 6-0 to 10 or 12-0. On that note, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to report that the Orioles evidently didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow those ideas to creep into their heads when they were down 6-0 last night; they just kept grinding.Starter Jason Hammel only lasted four innings plus three batters, and all six Minnesota runs were charged to him. Hammel\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4 IP, 8 H, 6 R, 2 BB, 6 K. The six strikeouts is a positive spin on things, however Hammel was pitching from behind in the count for most of the night. First-pitch strikes has been a bit of a theme for Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starters thus far in 2013, and even as far back as 2012. The idea is that you want to be able to get ahead in the count so that you can dictate what pitches you\xe2\x80\x99re throwing to the hitter later on. Hammel couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it last night, and he struggled with command for most of his outing. Fans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry too much about Hammel, because his stuff is good and he\xe2\x80\x99ll shake this outing in his next start. T.J. McFarland followed Hammel into the game, and was probably the unsung hero of the night. McFarland held Minnesota scoreless for two innings, just as Tommy Hunter (who got credited with the win) did following McFarland. Comebacks aren\xe2\x80\x99t possible unless you start scoring and the other team is made to stop.With Minnesota winning 1-0 in the second inning, Joe Mauer plated two runs with a two-RBI single with the bases loaded. Minnesota would add one in the third, and then two more in the fifth on an RBI-single by Plouffe and an RBI-ground out by Hicks. So come the top of the sixth the O\xe2\x80\x99s trailed 6-0; enter those feelings of doubt for most teams, right? Not the Baltimore Orioles. Not the \xe2\x80\x9ccomeback kids.\xe2\x80\x9d Suddenly they went from famine to having the sky raining doubles. Markakis doubled to lead off the inning, and he was plated by a Chris Davis RBI-double. Davis in turn scored on an RBI-double by Hardy, who scored on an RBI-double by Chris Dickerson. By the end of the inning the \xe2\x80\x9ccomeback kids\xe2\x80\x9d had cut the Minnesota lead in half, and served notice to the home team that they\xe2\x80\x99d be in a dog fight for the rest of the night\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and with that said, Minnesota apparently wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready for a dog fight. You have to be of a certain mindset to play with a big lead as well, because often times what can happen is that they go into a coast-type mindset. Nate McLouth continued the doubles-parade in the top of the seventh, but Manny Machado bucked that trend with a measly infield single on which McLouth scored on an error by Plouffe. Machado ended up at second base on that error, and he scored on an RBI-single by Nick Markakis that brought the Birds to within two. And thus the doubles began again, as Markakis scored on an RBI-double by Chris Davis, and suddenly we had a tie game.Courtesy of Jesse Johnson-USA TODAY SportsThe home team has a big advantage in any extra-inning game because in having the last at-bat they can end the game with one swing. Furthermore, they can utilize their closer in the top of the ninth and not have to worry about not having him to close out the game. However that aside, this game would have only been another one out of 162 had the Orioles allowed Minnesota to beat them with the last at-bat. Luckily for Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans, they took care of business in the 10th inning. Chris Dickerson scored from second base on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single, and Nick Markakis scored Nate McLouth with a sac fly. Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 RBI-single scored Machado; in the backs of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s minds had to be thoughts of not having to use closer Jim Johnson if the Orioles could put another run across, however Minnesota recorded the final out and we went to the last of the inning.This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just any save for Jim Johnson; by recording his 35th save in a row, he broke a team record previously set by Randy Myers. Last season the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a huge win on May 6th in Boston that included Chris Davis getting the win in relief. That was our first indication that this team could be something special. This win probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite as dramatic as that, however it serves to show us what this team is capable of doing. This was the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first comeback win of six runs or more since 2010. Certainly Jason Hammel\xe2\x80\x99s performance had much to be desired, however Hammel isn\xe2\x80\x99t the type of player to sit and accept his outing. He\xe2\x80\x99ll work in his next bullpen session to improve his command and hit his spots so that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t working from behind in the count as much. However this was a great team win from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint, and one in which they\xe2\x80\x99re very deserving of that \xe2\x80\x9ccomeback kids\xe2\x80\x9d term.The Orioles will make a roster move before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game and formally call up Steve Johnson to make his first start of 2013 in place of the injured Miguel Gonzalez. No word of what the corresponding roster move will be, however I suspect that the O\xe2\x80\x99s will probably option Alex Burnett back to Norfolk. Johnson will be opposed by Vance Worley of Minneosta, who\xe2\x80\x99s still looking for his first win of 2013. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
05/12/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Rotating Rotation - Birds Watcher', 'ro\xc2\xb7ta\xc2\xb7tion [roh-tey-shuhn]\xc2\xa0noun \xe2\x80\xa6 1. the\xc2\xa0act\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0rotating;\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0turning\xc2\xa0around\xc2\xa0as\xc2\xa0on\xc2\xa0an\xc2\xa0axis. \xc2\xa0 2. a regularly\xc2\xa0recurring\xc2\xa0succession.This is something the Baltimore Orioles do not have. There is nothing \xe2\x80\x9cregularly recurring\xe2\x80\x9d about the starting pitching rotation of the Birds. But maybe that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter so much anymore in this modern era of baseball.I am an old man for a blog writer. I can actually remember the 1971 four-man rotation of Jim Palmer, Mike Cuellar, Pat Dobson, and Dave McNally. McNally had 30 starts that year, whereas the other three posted 37 or 38. These guys averaged about 250 innings a year between 1969-1973.May 2, 2013; Anaheim, CA, USA; Baltimore Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman (30) pitches against the Los Angeles Angels during the third inning at Angel Stadium of Anaheim. Mandatory Credit: Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY SportsBut the point I\xe2\x80\x99m getting at here is that, in those days, you pretty much knew every fourth game who would be pitching, and by extension for the whole year. Later, when five-man rotations became the more reasonable paradigm, one could follow his team and pretty much know \xe2\x80\x93 with only a few exceptions \xe2\x80\x93 who would be rotating as a starter throughout the season. Maybe there are some modern teams out there like this, as I don\xe2\x80\x99t closely follow the majority of them; but I can say for sure that the Baltimore Orioles are not, and have not in any recent memory, been one of them.Already this year with 38 total games in the books, the Orioles lead the baseball universe by having had nine different starters. And it looks like we are only just getting started with the rotating door of the rotating pitchers of the rotation. It can make one\xe2\x80\x99s head rotate as well, and it now seems almost silly to have so much pondered over spring training as to which player would be the fifth starter.This situation is not normal. It is crazy. But it may not be deadly. And for that, Orioles fans can thank Dan Duquette who has loaded up the system with viable choices. I well remember FanFest 2012 when a year ago in January, Nick Markakis was asked about his observations upon the off season and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe sure seem to be stockpiling a lot of arms around here.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Ah \xe2\x80\xa6 yep! Some people collect stamps or coins; Dan Duquette collects pitchers.Of the starting five pitchers this season, only Chris Tillman seems to be on solid ground at the moment. Jason Hammel has had multiple consecutive rough outings and can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to command the ball (which is, by the way, a phrase never heard until recent years). Michael Gonzalez is at least briefly on the DL. Jake Arrieta is throwing the ball for Norfolk now (with word today that he has a stiff shoulder). And also today, Wei-Yin Chen had to depart early with an oblique strain \xe2\x80\x93 the severity of which is yet undetermined. These guys have more ups and downs than my stock portfolio \xe2\x80\xa6 and less guarantees of ultimate reward.I probably sound very critical, and truly I do not mean to be. Stuff happens. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why it happens more frequently than it did 40 years ago, I can only observe that it does and we are into the mode of \xe2\x80\x9cthe next man up.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So really, I mean for this to be a positive blog post, because the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 unlike most franchises \xe2\x80\x93 are able to dip into the minors and bring up the next guy and continue to win. At this moment, the Birds are on pace to win 98 games.So who will be the next man up if indeed Chen has to shut down for a time \xe2\x80\xa6 or to fill in one or another of a few pending holes in the rotation? I am guessing it might well be Jair Jurrjens, who right now has an ERA of 2.62 and a WHIP of 1.16. He also has a clause in his contract that releases him if he is not called up by a certain approaching date.But will we ever see the day in Baltimore where there is a relatively \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d rotation? And who will be the five main guys? I am guessing that we are never going to get close to such a scenario this year, and I\xe2\x80\x99m honestly good with that \xe2\x80\x93 never expected to get there this season. But I am thinking that 2014 will feature something more regular. Thinking logically, there would seem to be two certain long-term pieces in Dylan Bundy and Kevin Gausman. I believe Chris Tillman is the real deal and has largely figured out what it takes to be a consistent winner. Chen looks like a long-term keeper and innings-eater (believing today\xe2\x80\x99s incident to be but a bump in the road). The fifth spot is a more open question as I see it. Until recent weeks, we would all say it is Hammel. It would be great to see the Jurrjens of the past reappear, and I do not think that is impossible. Perhaps it will be Tsuyoshi Wada \xe2\x80\x93 who was to be the better of the two Oriental pickups from last year. It really should be Arrieta, whom I believe to be the most talented \xe2\x80\xa6 but I see him as a reliever along the lines of Brian Matusz \xe2\x80\x93 guys who can be lights out for a short time but who don\xe2\x80\x99t have some issue of fortitude for the starting role. And I cannot explain the Zack Britton situation \xe2\x80\xa6 can only say that he has dropped off the radar with a current Norfolk ERA of 3.38 with a WHIP of 1.67 (Yikes! \xe2\x80\xa6 has 12 walks in 24 innings).Over recent years, commentators of the Orioles have looked in at the team and said that it will go as far as the starting pitching takes it. Well, that could pretty generally be said about every team. And though we have lived through some real adventures with the rotating rotations, honestly, the anemic offence has cost the team more of the losses than the starting pitching\xe2\x80\xa6 that is, until this year. Now the offense has become a genuine strength with league stats in the top handful of every category. It is NOW true that the Orioles will go as far as the starters take them \xe2\x80\x93 given the run support AND the top-notch bullpen.We have an interesting 18 months ahead to see how all of this shakes out for the Orioles. So what do you think? ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles 6, Twins 0: Three home runs propel Orioles to ...', "" The Orioles defeated the Twins today to win another series, but with Wei-Yin Chen exiting early with an injury, the win could come at a very steep price. We're still waiting to see what the official diagnosis is, as MASN reported a right oblique strain, but speculation after the game was a cramp. So while we wait for more on Chen, let's talk about the whole game.  Scott Diamond wasn't nearly as scary as reported, and the Orioles got all the runs they'd need in the first inning. With Nick Markakis on base and two outs, Chris Davis hit his 11th home run of the season. It was Davis' only hit on the day, but it was a big one.  After Chen faced just three batters in the top of the first (thanks to a strike 'em out, throw 'em out double play), the bottom of the O's lineup go to work. J.J. Hardy singled with one out, then came in to score on a single from backup catcher Chris Snyder. Markakis followed that with a double, but Snyder (and third base coach Bobby Dickerson) decided to test the Twins and was thrown out at home to end the inning.  I wouldn't call it a base running error for Snyder to get thrown out, but it still wasn't fun to see. But the Twins returned the favor quickly. Justin Morneau singled into right field to lead off the second inning and tried to stretch the hit into a double. Markakis said no and threw him out at second for the first out. Chen retired the next two.    The Orioles increased their lead to 4-0 in the fourth inning on Adam Jones' fifth home run of the year. Only once this year had Diamond allowed four runs, and he wasn't finished giving up runs today (spoiler!)    Chen gave up one single each in the third, fourth, and fifth innings, but never allowed more than one base runner per inning. The Twins just weren't able to string together any rallies. Unfortunately after the fifth inning, Chen left the mound holding his right side and had to be taken out of the game having thrown just 73 pitches. It remains to be seen how much time, if any, Chen will miss.  Meanwhile, after giving Diamond a break in the fourth inning, the O's were right back at it in the fifth. With one out, Markakis walked to get on base for the third time of the game, then Manny Machado doubled to put runners at second at third. The Twins elected to intentionally walk Adam Jones to reach....Chris Davis?? I scoffed at such a thing, with no offense to Jones. But the plan (sort of) worked. Davis chopped a ground ball to the right side, but it wasn't hit in a way that allowed a double play. The Twins got the out at first but Markakis came in to score. Wieters grounded out to end the inning.     In the top of the sixth, as the announcers were speculating on Chen's injury, Steve Pearce hit a ball to left center field that sailed out for his second home run of the year. I didn't like seeing Pearce in left field instead of Nate McLouth, but again it was proven why I'm not the right person to run this baseball team.  From then out it was a battle of the bullpens, although I don't know how much of a battle it really is when one team is up by six runs. Tommy Hunter replaced Chen in the sixth inning and worked around a double to pitch a scoreless inning.  Despite the big lead, Buck Showalter turned to Darren O'Day in the seventh inning. Showalter said before the game that O'Day needed the work. He gave up a double in his first inning of work, but it was only due to defensive replacement Nate McLouth losing a ball in the sun. Other than that his stuff looked filthy. He wasn't so good in the eighth, when he gave up a walk and a hit with one out, and was replaced by Brian Matusz, who got two quick outs.  Pedro Strop came in for the ninth inning and looked like the Strop of old, getting three quick outs for the win.   "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""Baltimore Orioles:Questioning ol' blue - Birds Watcher"", 'This past week the Baltimore Orioles along with the baseball community watched as two different incidents with umpires occurred in games. We all saw both situations, however just to review: in incident #1 umpire Angel Hernandez looked at the replay of a clear Oakland home run in Cleveland on Wednesday, only to let the play stand as a double. In incident #2 on Thursday, Fieldin Culbreth\xc2\xa0incorrectly interpreted a rule that allowed the Houston Astros to remove a pitcher before actually facing a batter.Courtesy of David Richard-USA TODAY SportsBoth situations were clear blown calls, however they\xe2\x80\x99re both different. According to MLB, the Hernandez play was merely a judgement call while the Culbreth play was the incorrect interpretation of a rule. Culbreth has since been suspended by baseball for two games, and the entire umpiring crew was fined. I would commend the league for taking action against Culbreth. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t unprecedented in the sense that umpires have been suspended before, notably Bob Davidson last season. However, there is just criticism to be made of them hiding behind the \xe2\x80\x9cjudgement call\xe2\x80\x9d stance with Hernandez. I say this for two reasons; first off the home run call was ten times more blatant than the rule interpretation case. However this is not the first time that Angel Hernandez has been involved in some sort of controversy. It seems that at least once or twice a year there\xe2\x80\x99s some situation involving Hernandez, be it a blown call or some on-field spat with a player or coach.Players and coaches are held to a standard of professionalism, and they have every right to expect the same from umpires. Last weekend John Hirschbeck ejected Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Bryce Harper for gesturing his hands in the air. In no way does that violate the standards of professionalism of the game. Yet an umpire can literally not know a rule\xe2\x80\xa6? As they say on ESPN prior to Monday Night Football,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6c\xe2\x80\x99mon man!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0In fairness, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the league handles disciplinary matters with umps internally. Guys might well be \xe2\x80\x9cheld accountable\xe2\x80\x9d for their miscues in private. For the most part, I agree with an organization or company publically supporting it\xe2\x80\x99s employee while privately scorning. However baseball is a bit different; when a player struggles to the point of going to the minors, it\xe2\x80\x99s done very publically. When a coach is fired, it\xe2\x80\x99s done in a very public manner. Why are umpires held above that?I really do want to be fair; these kinds of incidents are news partially due in part to the fact that the unpires generally get the calls right. However it\xe2\x80\x99s the unwillingness to listen to reason that ticks off a lot of people. To top it off, Peter Gammonds was on the radio in the aftermath of the Hernandez play, and he insinuated that Hernandez purposely blew the call (link to article). According to Gammonds, Hernandez is dead set against the use of instant replay and he made the wrong call on purpose in protest of that. If that\xe2\x80\x99s true, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need more than just a suspension to atone for this. I would call on baseball to seriously look into who\xe2\x80\x99s umpiring their games. What if Oakland finishes one game out of the playoffs? But hey, at least Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s voice about instant replay was heard.I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that baseball needs to publically cut these guys\xe2\x80\x99 necks off. However if a call is blown blatantly or a horrible decision is made by an umpire, someone needs to be accountable. With that said, there\xe2\x80\x99s one aspect of the Culbreth situation that stands out from the Hernandez issue: Anaheim played under protest. Section 4.19 of the MLB rulebook discusses playing under protest, and it specifically says that it cannot be on a judgement call by an umpire. Mike Scioscia informed Culbreth that he was violating a rule in a game, and Culbreth disagreed and did it anyway. Scioscia then informed Culbreth that he was playing the game under protest. Anaheim won the game in the end, so the protest was dropped, however had Houston won the game Scioscia would have had to file a formal protest with the league. A decision would have come from the league office on the matter, and if their disciplinary action against Culbreth is any indication I suspect that they would have ordered the game replayed.One could justifiably argue that the Hernandez call wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x9cprotestable\xe2\x80\x9d given that it was a judgement call. However at best you could claim that Hernandez was interpreting what is and is not a home run incorrectly, therefore it was rule interpretation. However we don\xe2\x80\x99t see teams playing under protest like that so much anymore, and it\xe2\x80\x99s almost seen as an archaic part of baseball. Perhaps if more managers were willing to go this route we\xe2\x80\x99d start seeing the calls get tighter. It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that managers and players aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting through to umpires and the league by making veiled comments about the umpiring in their clubhouses after games. So why not use the protest rules that the league provides? If the league has to listen to more protests, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make attempts to shore up what the umpires are doing and saying.I think that for the most part, big league umps do a fair job of calling these games. However all it takes is a renegade ump to screw things up for the other guys. There are some great umpires out there, including the crew who\xe2\x80\x99s done this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 series with Minnesota. And the good umpires will also accept blame for what happens. When Jim Joyce blew the perfect game call a few years ago, he admitted it immediately and it was obvious he felt terrible about it. The same is true of Richie Garcia in the Jeffrey Maier game in 1996 at Yankee Stadium. I have a lot of respect for those guys, as they owned up to their errors.

Many fans had groused over the past few weeks that the O\xe2\x80\x99s couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to sweep anyone in the final game of a series. If that\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest complaint that Orioles fans have, the season must be going okay. Nevertheless, yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game was not a chance at a sweep given that Minnesota won game two. However the Orioles were able to win the game and thus secure their ninth series win of the season (out of twelve). That\xe2\x80\x99s winning baseball no matter how you look at it folks.Starter Wei-Yin Chen was credited with the win, although he only went five innings in the game. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 5 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 3 K. Chen came out of the game after throwing only 73 pitches through five, and in effect was probably on part to at least pitch into the seventh inning. Chen felt some discomfort in his right side, which the Orioles later diagnosed as a strained oblique. After the game Chen said that he only felt the discomfort during the final at-bat of the fifth inning, and that he thought it was only a cramp. The Orioles can play around with the rotation a bit this week given that they have today and Thursday both as off days, but this is something to watch and with which to be a bit concerned moving forward.Courtesy of Brace Hemmelgarn-USA TODAY SportsThe O\xe2\x80\x99s took an early 2-0 lead when Chris Davis hit a two-run homer that appeared to land all the way in St. Paul, and which appeared to have the Minnesota faithful at Target Field buzzing for some time afterwards. Catcher Chris Snyder collected his first base hit (and RBI) as an Oriole in the second inning which scored J.J. Hardy, and the Orioles led 3-0. Adam Jones later joined the homer parade led by Davis in the third with a home run that hit the outfield wall\xe2\x80\x99s railing and bounced into the stands. Later on it was announced that Jones\xe2\x80\x99 homer was the quickest ball to ever go from someone\xe2\x80\x99s bat into the stands at Target Field. So if all else fails, Jones will have that feat! Steve Pearce would add a solo homer and the O\xe2\x80\x99s would manufacture another run to close out the scoring in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 6-0 victory to take the series.One very positive sign from this game was also the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen. Prior to the game the Birds optioned Steve Johnson back to Norfolk and brought up Mike Belfiore to add depth to the bullpen. Buck Showalter was hoping Chen would go deep into the game, however the injury prevented that from happening. However Hunter, O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Matusz, and Strop closed out the final four innings of the game without incident. Perhaps the most promising of all was Pedro Strop, who appears to be regaining some of his form from 2012. Strop pitched the ninth inning of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s loss as well as yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s victory, striking out two and not allowing a base runner in both games. Closer Jim Jonson will also have a minimum of three days off given that the O\xe2\x80\x99s lost on Saturday, didn\xe2\x80\x99t need him yesterday (in a non-save situation), and are off today.The Chen injury situation is something to watch today as well as this week. Given a five-man rotation Chen\xe2\x80\x99s next start could potentially be Sunday, however as I said the Orioles have two off days this week so if they had to I suppose they could skip him in the rotation. The team says it\xe2\x80\x99s an oblique, Chen says it\xe2\x80\x99s a cramp\xe2\x80\xa6time will tell. The good news is that if by chance he has to go to the DL, the O\xe2\x80\x99s could potentially bolster their bullpen in the short term given that they don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily need a fifth starter in the immediate future. However at some point if they needed a starter, I would bet Jair Jurrjens might be the guy to get the call given that he has an opt-out clause in his contract for June 15th. In the mean time, Orioles fans should simply hope that Chen is right when he says that it was only a cramp.

Absalon, Special for USA TODAY Sports)Story HighlightsManny Machado and Yonder Alonso are best friends and rising starsAlonso\'s sister, 23-year-old Yainee, is Machado\'s fianc\xc3\xa9eMachado has been somewhat overlooked on the national landscapeCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE -- Manny Machado, with his fianc\xc3\xa9e sitting to his left, his best friend to his right and his 4-month-old puppy on the floor, crinkles his nose and narrows his dark brown eyes.By one measure, no player in the American League means more to his team this year than Machado. Yet at the moment, this 20-year-old Baltimore Orioles sensation can barely squeeze in two sentences.Not when San Diego Padres first baseman Yonder Alonso, his best friend, is singing his praises.Tuesday night, Alonso and Machado, who hail from the baseball hotbed of South Florida, met on a major league diamond for the first time when the Padres and Orioles played an interleague game at Camden Yards.When Machado singled in his first at-bat and greeted Alonso, 26, their interaction differed from the usual in-game fraternization.Alonso is not just a friend but about to become family.Alonso\'s sister, 23-year-old Yainee,  is Machado\'s fianc\xc3\xa9e. The wedding is set for Dec. 6, 2014, in Paris.And Yonder is not waiting until the nuptials to speak his mind.So much of the airwaves and digital universe have been dominated by the game\'s fair-haired youngsters, Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels and Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals, that Machado has been somewhat overlooked on the national landscape.And, oh, how Yonder has noticed.""It\'s wrong; it\'s just wrong,"" he says. ""I hate that. It\'s not right. You\'re not going to compare him to Trout and the other dude? That sucks.""Look at the numbers; Manny is better. He\'s putting up better numbers. He\'s nicer. He\'s more likable. Everything. That\'s the reality of it.""I know he\'s going to let his game talk, but he\'s better than both guys. I think the other guys will have great careers, but when you talk about the best young players in the game, why can\'t you involve Manny in it?""Consider it done.Despite starting nearly four months after Trout and Harper, Machado proves he belongs in the conversation. He hit .294 with 12 homers and 50 RBI in his first 89 games, eclipsing Harper\'s production in a similar span and tying Trout in homers.This year, Machado, like Trout and Harper, has transcended wunderkind status and become a legitimate star. Machado was batting .331 with 28 runs and 24 RBI entering Tuesday, and in the previous 19 games he hit .405 with 12 multiple-hit games, including three doubles, one triple, three homers and 13 RBI.Machado entered Tuesday with three consecutive three-hit games. The only Orioles players with longer streaks are Cal Ripken Jr., Eddie Murray and Don Buford.All this, while evoking Charm City memories of Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson.""And you tell me he\'s not as good as those two other guys?"" says Yonder, who was batting .275 with four homers and 23 RBI entering Tuesday. ""Come on.""Machado just grins. He might be two months shy of legal drinking age, but he\'s mature enough to know not to join this debate.""I just go about my business, put up numbers and do my thing,"" Machado says. ""Just go out there, have fun, and everything else will fall in place.""One day, perhaps after the 2014 season when J.J. Hardy\'s contract expires, Machado will be back at shortstop, like Ripken and Alex Rodriguez in reverse. He already leads American League position players in WAR, which rates the total value of a player, and various defensive metrics rate him the best defensive third baseman in baseball.He\'d love to show he can become the game\'s best shortstop, too.""You think about it, it\'s in the back of your mind,"" says Machado, who ranks his meeting with Robinson this season as the highlight of his career. ""But I love this game so much, I just want to be out there. If you stop having fun, that\'s when you struggle.""Says Yonder, ""He has so much God-given ability, I don\'t think he\'ll ever struggle like the rest of us.""***No place like homeMachado, considered the Orioles\' most exciting young player to come along since Ripken debuted in 1981, walks with Yainee into their neighborhood Starbucks.He orders the usual, white chocolate mocha. Yainee does the same, only hot.The woman behind the counter recognizes Machado and hand-delivers the drink to him without charge, saying, ""Here you go, honey.""Yainee has to pay.""I\'m right there, but, hey, I don\'t play baseball,"" Yainee says, laughing.Yainee, once a member of the Miami Marlins\' Mermaids cheerleading squad,  graduated from Miami (Fla.) in December in pre-med. She is taking classes to be a physician\'s assistant. These days, her life is filled with baseball, living with Machado in an upscale condo  10 minutes from Baltimore\'s Inner Harbor and keeping track of her brother in San Diego.""I always tell (Machado) he\'s lucky,"" Yainee says. ""I know baseball. I know what to say, and what not to say, at the right times.""I learned that from my brother.""No one will ask them to make a reality show, they say.  They don\'t go to clubs. Well, they can\'t anyway, since Machado doesn\'t turn 21 until July 6. They sit home and watch TV, addicted to Swamp People and The Walking Dead.They\'ll play Call of Duty when Machado isn\'t engaging Yonder in NBA or FIFA battles.The only time they really disagree on anything is when watching the NBA. Machado is a die-hard Miami Heat fan. The Alonsos are life-long Los Angeles Lakers fans.""It\'s a house divided,"" Yainee says. ""We don\'t want to get on that subject.""Says Machado, ""I\'ve always been a huge LeBron (James) fan.""So imagine Machado\'s reaction when they got their new dog in spring training, an Alaskan Klee Kai, and Yainee got to name him.Kobe.""Come on, Kobe sounds better than LeBron,"" Yonder says. ""What kind of name is that for a dog? My sister is loyal.""This is what made it a bit awkward when Yonder\'s close friendship with Machado suddenly took on a third member, which evolved into a wedding engagement three months ago.\xc2\xa0(Photo: Gary A. Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports)***Friends and family""He would come over to the house every single day,"" Yonder says, ""and we\'d just hang out and play video games.""Then, it was like, \'Hey, man, you\'re not coming over to the house every day just to see me, man. What is the deal here, dude?\'""The three of them went on vacation to Spain in the winter of 2011, and when they returned, Machado knew he wanted to be more than friends with Yainee. He nervously asked Yonder if it was OK to date his sister.""I told him, \'Look, as long as you respect her and be there for her,\'"" Yonder says. ""And whatever happens, just know if something happens between you guys we\'re still friends. We were friends before, and we\'ll be friends afterward.""The dating morphed into love, and Machado drove Yainee to South Beach on Feb. 6 to propose. It wasn\'t something quite out of Hollywood. The kitchen sink broke during the day. The Cuban dinner was postponed until late evening. There was a homeless man sleeping on the beach right where Machado was about to propose.""I was a mess,"" Machado says. ""I was struggling to get the ring out. It was stuck in my pocket.""Says Yainee: ""He\'s on his knees and talking, saying sweet things, and I didn\'t even hear him propose. Guys think that it\'s like the movies, the woman says yes automatically. But you are so in shock. I finally said yes, but then I asked him to ask me again, because I didn\'t hear him.""Now they\'re about to become family, with Yonder staying at Machado\'s condo instead of the Padres\' team hotel while in town. One active player is known to be married to a major league colleague\'s sister; Minnesota Twins pitcher Josh Roenicke is married to Nikki Desmond, sister of Washington Nationals shortstop Ian.The Machado-Alonso ties date to 2009, when Yonder, then a junior at Miami, introduced himself by phone. Yonder, whose family defected from Cuba in 1995, said his agent wanted to see if he could recruit him. He declined the role but told Machado, who grew up in a single-family home, that if he ever needed anything or wanted to work out with him and his buddies to please call.""I said to myself, \'If he really wants to work and be really good, he\'ll call,\'"" Yonder says. ""A year goes by, and then he starts texting and calling me all of the time.""When he gets drafted (third overall in 2010, behind Harper and Jameson Taillon of the Pittsburgh Pirates), he then signs, he says, \'I\'m ready. I want to train and do the things I need to do.\'""***No shortcutsMachado didn\'t even know how to perform squats in the weight room  but soon became Yonder\'s shadow during intense winter workouts. To this day, they talk by phone every morning, dissecting the previous night\'s games, their hitting strokes, opposing pitchers and strategy.Yes, every once in a while, Yainee joins the conversation.It\'s this workout regimen that has Machado and Yonder seething at the hits their hometown took in baseball\'s most recent doping scandal.It\'s as if every player from Miami who performs well, they say, must be on performance-enhancing drugs, thanks to the Biogenesis Clinic scandal and the reports that Rodriguez, their boyhood idol, was at the center of the illegal drug use.""It\'s obviously unfortunate and not something anyone wants to hear about,"" says Alonso, whose Padres and Miami teammate Yasmani Grandal is serving a 50-game suspension for a positive testosterone test and was tied to the Biogenesis scandal. ""But to us, this situation shouldn\'t be so negative. People are taking this so wrong. I think there\'s a lot of positive things we can learn from and understand from it.""What we\'ve learned is that those things are unacceptable in this game and will never be accepted. The sport is extremely clean, and it\'s getting better all of the time.""People don\'t realize all of the sacrifices we go through. Yes, there are a few guys who did things wrong, but there are thousands of people playing in Miami who do it right. They don\'t see us coming in every day at 8 a.m., busting our ass and working as hard as we can. Those are the things that really piss us off.""Says Machado: ""People want to judge you because where you\'re from. That\'s not right.""Yonder and Machado might live in Miami but say they never heard of Biogenesis until the Miami New Times\' report on the clinic, which has since closed.They eschew South Beach\'s legendary nightlife. They  don\'t wear tropical shirts open with diamond-encrusted chains dangling from their necks.""People think, ""Oh, you\'re a big-leaguer, you live in Miami, you can probably go to any club you want,"" Machado says. ""The truth is that we are boring. We don\'t really let people in. We\'ve got a very close circle, and that\'s it.""For us, it\'s all about family.""It\'s why Machado, who bought his mom, Rosa Nunez, a home with his $5.4 million signing bonus, flew her to Minnesota last weekend so they could spend Mother\'s Day together, while Yonder and Yainee were in Tampa with their parents, Luis, an executive with Sherwin-Williams, and Damaris, an accountant.""I grew up without a father in my life,"" says Machado, who has infrequent contact with him now, ""and I see how Yonder and Yainee grew up with their family. I want that. I\'ve always wanted that.""Family means everything to me, and now I can say we are all family.""CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Orioles Lose To Padres 3-2 On Jim Johnson\\u2019s Blown Save ...', ' BALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 When closer Jim Johnson walks to the mound in the ninth inning with the Baltimore Orioles ahead, the outcome is all but decided. For 35 straight games, Johnson came through in save situations. On the 36th such occasion, the right-hander finally gave a lead away. Chris Denorfia and Everth Cabrera hit two-out RBI singles off Johnson in the ninth, and the San Diego Padres got a home run from Carlos Quentin in a 3-2 victory Tuesday night. After the Orioles took a 2-1 lead in the eighth, Johnson (1-3) entered to try and secure the win. He gave up two consecutive singles before getting Jedd Gyorko to hit into a 6-4-3 double play. But Denorfia followed with a single up the middle and, after Johnson hit Nick Hundley with a pitch, Cabrera singled to center for a 3-2 lead. Johnson hadn\xe2\x80\x99t blown a save opportunity since July 27, 2012, against Oakland. His streak of 35 broke the previous team record of 34, set in 1997 by Randy Myers. \xe2\x80\x9cI really didn\xe2\x80\x99t put a whole lot of stock into it,\xe2\x80\x9d the right-hander said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was just something you guys like to talk about.\xe2\x80\x9d He blamed his reversal of fortune on poor location. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I got off the field I looked, and pitches were in different spots than they\xe2\x80\x99re normally at,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about execution. At this level the talent is too good. You have to execute and tonight I didn\xe2\x80\x99t and wasted a good effort from a lot of guys on this team.\xe2\x80\x9d His teammates couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember the last time he blew a save. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the first time I\xe2\x80\x99d ever seen it happen,\xe2\x80\x9d said second baseman Ryan Flaherty, who played all last season with Baltimore. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was incredible. He comes in the game and it\xe2\x80\x99s 1-2-3, and the game\xe2\x80\x99s over and everyone goes home. So, you get accustomed to that. You got a couple of balls that went through, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d San Diego won after losing three straight in Tampa Bay, despite holding the lead in the fifth inning or later in each game. \xe2\x80\x9cTo get to (Johnson) is a great accomplishment for us,\xe2\x80\x9d Padres manager Bud Black said. \xe2\x80\x9cThose are great on the road, they really are, to snatch one back when they took the lead.\xe2\x80\x9d Cabrera\xe2\x80\x99s hit was the 60,000th in Padres history. Luke Gregerson (2-2) got the last out in the eighth and Huston Street earned his ninth save. The Padres were 0-18 when trailing after eight innings. Street gave up a game-ending homer in the ninth against Tampa Bay on Saturday, so he was determined to make things right. \xe2\x80\x9cThe one in Tampa frustrated me more than any save in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Street said. \xe2\x80\x9cI took a lot of responsibility for not making those pitches. It bugged me, so tonight was one I really wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d He then said something that Johnson can take to heart. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can come back and get it done,\xe2\x80\x9d Street said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what this game is all about. It\xe2\x80\x99s bouncing back. It\xe2\x80\x99s just moving on to the next day and making the next pitch. You make the next pitch and good things will happen.\xe2\x80\x9d Flaherty homered for the Orioles, who fell to 18-2 when leading after eight. With the score tied at 1 in the eighth, Flaherty drew a one-out walk from Andrew Cashner and was replaced by pinch-runner Alexi Casilla. After Cashner threw to first base several times to check the runner, Casilla took off for second. The throw from Hundley came up short and bounced into the outfield, allowing Casilla to reach third on the error. Steve Pearce followed with a line-drive single to left to chase Cashner, who matched a career high by working 7 1-3 innings. Orioles starter Chris Tillman allowed one run, four hits and two walks in seven innings. Although the right-hander wasn\xe2\x80\x99t involved in the decision, he lowered his ERA to 3.40 and remained unbeaten since April 17. It was the first meeting between the teams since 2010 and first in Baltimore since 2002. The series is tied at 5. Quentin led off the second inning with a drive to left to put the Padres up 1-0. San Diego then loaded the bases with two outs before Tillman struck out Cabrera. Flaherty tied it in the third with an opposite-field fly that dropped into the front row of the left-field seats. It was only the second home run off Cashner in his five starts this season. In the sixth, Quentin\xe2\x80\x99s bid for another home run was denied by center fielder Adam Jones, who made a leaping catch at the top of the 7-foot wall. NOTES: The Orioles placed LHP Wei-Yin Chen (strained right oblique) on the 15-day disabled list and recalled RHP Alex Burnett and INF Yamaico Navarro from Triple-A Norfolk. \xe2\x80\xa6 The Padres have hit 20 homers in their last 15 games. \xe2\x80\xa6 Orioles LHP Tsuyoshi Wada, recovering from elbow ligament replacement surgery, will make his first rehabilitation start Thursday for Norfolk. \xe2\x80\xa6 Jason Marquis (4-2) starts for the Padres against Freddy Garcia (0-1) in the series finale Wednesday afternoon. \xe2\x80\xa6 Of the 47 home runs Tillman has allowed in his career, 32 have been solo shots.

Over Tillman\'s past five starts, he has a 1.87 ERA and opponents are batting .195 against him. He recorded three wins and the Orioles won four of those five games. In his eight starts, Tillman leads all Orioles starters with 47 2/3 innings pitched and his five quality starts are tied with Wei-Yin Chen for the team lead.11 -- errors committed by the Orioles in 39 games.The Orioles lost to the San Diego Padres on Tuesday night, but it was another error-free night at the ballpark for Orioles defenders. With 11 errors in 39 games, the Orioles are first in the American League and second in the major league to only the Arizona Diamondbacks, who have committed 10. Their .992 fielding percentage is second in baseball, too.

Starting with that hit, Pearce, who is usually used as a designated hitter, has since gone 10-for-25 with two home runs and seven RBIs. By batting .400 over that nine-game stretch, he has increased his season average from a string of goose eggs to a respectable .250.nine -- hits for Manny Machado this past weekend.Third baseman Manny Machado had three hits in each game of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 three-game series against the Minnesota Twins over the weekend. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Machado was the first player younger than 21 to have three or more hits in three straight games since a Pittsburgh Pirates rookie named Rennie Stennett did it in September 1971.

Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 starter Chris Tillman had his struggles, and in fact he got off to an inauspicious start when Carlos Quentin bashed a solo home run in the second inning. Tillman also had a few guys on base here and there, and got himself into a few jams. However as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said previously, pitchers are going to get themselves into trouble over time; it\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of the position for the most part. It\xe2\x80\x99s how you deal with the guys on base or \xe2\x80\x9cthe jams\xe2\x80\x9d which separates the men from the boys.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIf we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about runs surrendered, Tillman dealt with the \xe2\x80\x9ctrouble\xe2\x80\x9d very well. The aforementioned home run was the only run he gave up. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 2 BB, 7 K. That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty decent stat line from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint. However the one area where Tillman did struggle just a bit was the same aspect in which Oriole starters have struggled all year: pitch count. Part of that has to do with the seven strikeouts, as that costs a\xc2\xa0bare minimum\xc2\xa0of 21 pitches right there. After four innings Tillman had thrown 92 pitches, but he finished with 112 total pitches in the game (over his final three innings he only threw 20 pitches total). Tillman seemed to step it up a notch in the sixth inning when Carlos Quentin made another home run bid (or at the very least a bid for extra bases) by sending a shot to center field. However Adam Jones chased the ball down and made a leaping catch at the wall, awarding Quentin nothing more than a loud out for his trouble.The Orioles tied the score at one in the third inning when Ryan Flaherty sent an opposite-field home run into the left field grandstand. For the record, San Diego starter Andrew Cashner was as solid as Tillman was. I think that there are probably a lot of Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans out there this morning who are complaining about the team\xe2\x80\x99s offensive production last night, and perhaps justifiably so in many aspects. However this was an old fashioned pitchers\xe2\x80\x99 duel. Guys not getting on base is what happens in these kinds of games. San Diego manager Bud Black probably left Cashner in just a bit too long, as he started to elevate his pitches in the last of the eighth. Ryan Flaherty drew a walk, and was lifted for pinch runner Alexi Casilla\xe2\x80\xa6who promptly stole second and then went to third on an E2. Steve Pearce\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single scored Casilla, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly led this game late by the score of 2-1.So with the Orioles taking the lead in the last of the eighth, that meant the top of the ninth was Jim Johnson time. Johnson of course held a team record of 35 consecutive saves converted (and counting). Good morning, good afternoon, and good night, right? Generally speaking, yes. San Diego had two outs and a runner on third, and Chris Denorfia sent a single up the middle which scored the runner from third and tied the game. That goes as a blown save for Johnson, ending his consecutive games saved streak. Nick Hundley was hit by a pitch, which put Denorfia in scoring position, and Everth Cabrera\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single scored Denorfia. Suddenly the Birds trailed, and while they got the tying run on base in the last of the ninth they were unable to bring it across home plate.The issue at hand is not Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s consecutive games saved streak, but moreso the fact that this was a game that the Orioles would rather not have dropped. However the fact is that a baseball season comes with 60 wins and 60 losses all but guaranteed. Included in those 60 losses will be games like this. For the Orioles, it seems that the shoe is almost always on the other foot in these kinds of games, especially at home. Furthermore with regard to Johnson, as Buck Showalter always says,\xc2\xa0we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with human beings here.\xc2\xa0Nobody feels worse about that than Johnson, but even he knew that at some point he\xe2\x80\x99d blow a save. As I said above, pitchers will eventually get themselves in trouble. Jim Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s no exception to that.It\xe2\x80\x99s also easy to say that the Orioles would have won this game had they gotten more people on base, scored more runs, etc. That goes without saying. However the ebb and flow of the game was that of a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s duel. Today might well be an offensive shoot out for all we know. part of baseball is taking the good with the bad. Luckily for the Orioles, not only do they get back on the horse today, but they get to do so early. This afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s series finale is a 12:35 \xe2\x80\x9cbusinessman\xe2\x80\x99s special.\xe2\x80\x9d All of Birdland \xe2\x80\x93 I REPEAT \xe2\x80\x93 All of Birdland\xc2\xa0has my expressed and written permission to skip out of work to attend today\xe2\x80\x99s game! That aside, Freddy Garcia will take to the mound for the Birds this afternoon, against a San Diego team of which he was a part during Spring Training. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the roster out of camp, and later signed with the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Garcia will be opposed by crafty southpaw Jason Marquis.Incidentally, the Orioles made a few roster moves prior to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game. Wei-Yin Chen was sent to the 15-day DL with a strained oblique, and as a corresponding move the O\xe2\x80\x99s recalled Alex Burnett. On Monday the Orioles had also optioned Mike Belfiore back to triple-A Norfolk; yesterday they announced the corresponding move, which was to recall infielder Yamaico Navarro. With the off days being what they are, the O\xe2\x80\x99s won\xe2\x80\x99t need a fifth starter until next week. Burnett will serve as bullpen support and Navarro as bench support in the interim.

Hardy isn\'t in love with his new gloveMay 15, 2013|By Dan Connolly | The Baltimore SunIn a sense, baseball players are a lot like other craftsmen.They have tools they become comfortable with over the years, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to make a change when a manufacturer discontinues or alters a product.That\xe2\x80\x99s sort of what has happened to Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy this season, although it was actually baseball\xe2\x80\x99s umpires who led to a change in Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s most treasured piece of equipment.Since he broke into the majors in 2005, Hardy used a Rawlings Pro 200 4K 11-1/2 inch model glove. It\xe2\x80\x99s made of \xe2\x80\x9ckipskin leather\xe2\x80\x9d and is a cream color. If you Google \xe2\x80\x9cRawlings Pro 200 4K\xe2\x80\x9d you can quickly find the \xe2\x80\x9cJ.J. Hardy Game Day Glove\xe2\x80\x9d for $329.99. var adSkipCounter = 0; There\xe2\x80\x99s just one problem. Hardy can\xe2\x80\x99t really use it in a game. Or at least not now.Apparently last year umpires began complaining that the cream color made it difficult for them to view the ball entering the glove \xe2\x80\x94 affecting calls such as short hops versus catching the ball in the air.\xe2\x80\x9cUmpires didn\xe2\x80\x99t want us using this color anymore because they have a hard time seeing the ball go in because it is kind of the same color as the ball \xe2\x80\x94 but not really,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hardy, who won his first Rawlings Gold Glove Award in 2012.This spring, Rawlings told Hardy they would still make him his version of the glove, but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee that umpires would allow him to use it. They told the same thing to infielders, pitchers and outfielders that used the creamed color leather.\xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s not an official rule,\xe2\x80\x9d Hardy said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to push it.\xe2\x80\x9dSo Hardy is now using a Rawlings Pro 200 4RT. It\xe2\x80\x99s supposedly an exact replica, just a rust colored glove. And, yet, Hardy senses that it is different.\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the same glove; same leather, just a different color. And I just don\xe2\x80\x99t like it as much,\xe2\x80\x9d Hardy said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it is the same. Just like everything else it is a feel thing. You have to feel good and comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9dBaseball players are a superstitious group. So could the \xe2\x80\x9cdifference\xe2\x80\x9d just be in his head?\xe2\x80\x9cIt could be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cBaseball people will tell you gloves are a feel thing. And it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel the same.\xe2\x80\x9dThere could be a silver lining to this off-color story, though. Hardy met with a Rawlings representative in Anaheim earlier this month and was told that Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s Chase Utley and St. Louis\xe2\x80\x99 David Freese still use a cream-colored glove.The rep took a picture of Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s, and they sent it to umpiring headquarters for a ruling. A hopeful Hardy has ordered a couple of his old models from the manufacturer, and he hopes to get an answer soon.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m still using the other one. It\xe2\x80\x99s broken in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right.

05/17/2013,"[(""How Do The Orioles' Hitters Stack Up By Position Against ..."", ' Watching the bottom of the Orioles\' lineup, frequently manned by the second baseman and designated hitter of the night, there is the temptation to make sweeping proclamations about how bad they are. One might be tempted, for instance, to give in to the natural human tendency towards hyperbole and say that the Orioles designated hitters and second basemen are, collectively, the worst-hitting of either kind in the American League. In general, it\'s hard to say whether this is even a bad thing, this tendency. In this particular situation, it\'s even harder to say so, because that hyperbole is the truth. The Orioles have the worst-hitting second basemen (measured by OPS) in all of MLB, and the-worst hitting DH in all of the American League. Through 40 games, two of the nine positions in the every day lineup are the worst of their kind. They are not merely bad. Compared to their competitors, they are literally the worst that there is. The DH for the Orioles has been so bad that it is the second-worst of any unit for any team in the AL, bested, or perhaps worsted, by Seattle shortstops, who are mustering a measly .338 OPS. Good God. That almost makes the .488 OPS of Orioles DH look balmy in comparison, except, wait, no it doesn\'t. That\'s awful. I might have to go cry now. Lest we dwell on nothing but the bad, here\'s how the Orioles are faring at each position against their peers. The alchemy of talent and good fortune have the Orioles standing above most or all of the rest in some positions even as their 2B and DH languish at the bottom.        Position AVG OBP SLG OPS Rank (AL)   DH .148 .244 .244 15   C .227 .304 .404 7   1B .321 .417 .664 1   2B .187 .257 .273 15   3B .343 .379 .541 3   SS .227 .259 .396 10   LF .278 .360 .456 2   CF .311 .347 .479 3   RF .307 .350 .416 7      Four positions (1B, 3B, LF, CF) are better than most or all of their peers, with 1B, being mostly Chris Davis, as the best by more than 100 points of OPS over the closest competitor. This is the highest positional OPS in all of MLB. Two (C, RF) are about average, at least if we measure by OPS. One (SS) is below average, and the two mentioned in the introduction are the worst. All of this together adds up to a team slash line of .263/.325/.431, a .756 OPS that ranks fifth in the American League, with the only divisional opponent the Orioles trail being Boston. The AL East teams rank 4th-8th in the AL in overall OPS, with Tampa Bay, New York, and Toronto following immediately after the Orioles. Toronto has a .725 OPS, which is the worst of the division. The best team OPS in the AL is Cleveland, with a .791 OPS through their 39 games.    Frustrating as it is to see those black holes in the lineup every night, the Orioles could be doing a lot worse than they are, and the rest of the lineup is generally doing enough to make up for those players who aren\'t performing. There should be concern if Davis, Manny Machado, and/or Nate McLouth fall back into the pack, which is a possibility, no matter how many ""through X games"" comparisons to Harper and Trout the local and national media want to make with Machado. If those players stumble, then the bottom of the lineup will really drag down the team more than they already do. Are there any solutions to the big problems here? Second base seems to be mostly stuck where it is. There could be some light at the end of the tunnel for DH, with Steve Pearce heating up - he\'s now out-OPSing the likes of Nick Markakis and Matt Wieters - and the struggling Nolan Reimold relegated to the bench. Anything Pearce can contribute above a .488 OPS is an improvement over what we\'ve seen so far. Pearce\'s current .759 OPS would still only rank 11th among AL teams, but in absolute terms, would be a huge stride. Even shortstop might get better, if you squint. J.J. Hardy is currently working on an 11-game hitting streak, with four home runs in that stretch. Even with that, he\'s still only batting the .227/.259/.396 you see above. He\'s not going to turn into one of the best hitters in the AL, but if he was slumping in April and is now warming up, he could pick up some slack offensively to go along with his already-excellent fielding. They are good enough to get by, if the starting rotation settles into some kind of consistency that isn\'t consistently bad. But that is another subject for another day. For now, take comfort in this: for every Ryan Flaherty, there is a Davis; for every Reimold, there is a Machado. So far, that\'s enough for the Orioles to win.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

However, two of them were pitched well enough to have most often been a win (if there was run support), and two of them had sufficient run production to have most often been a win if there was reasonably solid pitching. My guess is that the poor pitching will be more remembered than the games with poor hitting.May 19, 2013; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter (26) during a game against the Tampa Bay Rays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsTeams will go through stretches like this during a season \xe2\x80\x93 even the best clubs. The Orioles had a similar streak last year where they lost six consecutive games from May 26 through June 1 \xe2\x80\xa6 two to KC, three to Toronto, and one to Tampa Bay. Great players go through occasional setbacks, and it is inevitable that even a stalwart like Jim Johnson is going to have a rough stretch. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that this is a team that won 109 consecutive games when leading after seven innings \xe2\x80\x93 nearly an unprecedented statistic. Baseball is simply a sport where things even out over time, which is why it takes 162 games to determine who is the best for the playoffs.Without doubt, the starting pitching is the largest concern. Chris Tillman is a solid performer at this juncture. Wei-Yin Chen should not be out that terribly long, and Miguel Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99 injury is not of the catastrophic sort. Jason Hammel is a larger concern at this time, but he has gone through stints like this in the past and figured out how to make the modifications for success. I\xe2\x80\x99ll confess to low hopes for Freddy Garcia to become a regular, but also believe Jair Jurrjens could well do it. There are a host of others in the wings \xe2\x80\x93 their names are familiar to Orioles fans \xe2\x80\x93 and one or two of them are going to figure out how to contribute. And likewise with relievers \xe2\x80\xa6 there is no reason to not see the bullpen as among the best in the sport \xe2\x80\x93 even with some recent shellings.There is no doubt that the 2013 Orioles remain a much improved offensive club over last year. But the best of opposing pitchers, when having a good day, will certainly slow them down; but that is true for even the very best teams. It is gratifying to see the Orioles making some moves to send Ryan Flaherty out to AAA to work on his hitting, while also bringing in a player like Danny Valencia \xe2\x80\x93 who has been stroking the ball well in recent weeks.I am looking for all of these troubles to turn around in short order. Baseball is an oft frustrating sport. The margins are narrow. Pitch placement is critical, and a broken bat flare can sometimes land just out of reach and change the entire game. The best hitters fail 65-70% of the time. But it all tends to even out over the course of 162 games, and three-quarters of the season remains. So, slowly step back from the panic button.

And a rough five-game homestand for the Orioles got even rougher in the sixth inning Sunday when Tampa Bay\'s Matt Joyce hit a soaring fly ball down the right field line in the Rays\' eventual 3-1 win.That\'s when all the fun started.Actually, it was only fun if your idea of a good time is a long game delay while both managers and all four umpires yak endlessly about whether Joyce\'s shot was a foul ball, a double or a homer. var adSkipCounter = 0; Trust me, the Geneva Convention guidelines were hammered out in less time. And you wonder why Major League Baseball is hurriedly trying to implement expanded instant replay review for next season?In a moment, we\'ll get into that. But first let\'s recap all the, ahem, action in the top of the sixth at Camden Yards.With one out, Joyce hits a shot that glances off the base of the foul pole in right field. After a moment\'s hesitation, first base ump Dan Iassogna rules it a fair ball and Joyce legs it into second base.Out pops Buck Showalter from the O\'s dugout. He argues that it\'s a foul ball.""That\'s what some of my players felt strongly about,"" Showalter said later.Seconds later, though, instant replay is clearly showing the ball hit the black base of the pole. It\'s definitely a home run. Now Rays manager Joe Maddon comes out to argue.And the gabfest is on.Maddon\'s stalling for time, waiting for his people to tell him if it\'s a homer or a double. By rule, only a home run is reviewable as to whether a ball is fair or foul. Maddon, the umps will say later, wants the play reviewed, but only if the consequence isn\'t the possibility of it being ruled a foul ball.Got that? Maddon wants the ruling to be either a homer or a double. He wants, metaphorically speaking, a Lamborghini or, at the very least, a Mercedes.No dice, say the umps. If we review it and see it\'s a foul ball, it\'s a foul ball.But ... let Showalter pick up the Maddon strategy at this point.""Maddon\'s waiting for some kind of feedback on what kind of argument he\'s got,"" Showalter said. ""He\'s gotta make a decision on whether he wants [the umpires] to go check it or not [on instant replay]. \'Cause he\'s got a chance that [they] go in there and end up calling it a foul ball, and not even a double.""So you gotta make that decision on whether you want to roll the dice for the home run. So when he got all the reports back from his people, I\'m sure he felt real confident on what was gonna be called. I have a [instant replay] guy who lets me know when I have a good argument. So I knew once [the umps] went inside [to review], it was gonna be a home run.""Which it was. The umps got it right, Showalter said. That was the main thing.But all the confusion and the endless yammering that preceeded the correct ruling is why you\'ll almost definitely see expanded replay review next season.""I think you\'re going to see a lot more replays as we go forward in the game,"" Showalter said. ""You\'re going to see more than just home runs reviewed. So you know I\'m all for it, just getting it right.""And I think the umpires are, too. They want to be right. More times than not, they are.""MLB sources now are saying that balls and strikes won\'t be reviewable by replay next season, but almost everything else will.Commissioner Bud Selig seems to leaning this way, too. In the past, Selig has made it clear he thinks instant replay should only be used to determine home run calls or whether a ball is trapped in the field.But these same sources say Selig has been embarrassed by all the blown calls and umpiring controversies of late. And they say he\'s now leaning toward broader use of instant replay.Look, I was originally one of those Luddites who argued against replay review in baseball. I thought the calls would take too long to make and disrupt the natural rhythm of the game.But guess what? The game is being disrupted enough as it is, even without expanded review. I don\'t know how long Sunday\'s delay was, but it was at least 10 or 15 minutes. So now I\'m thinking baseball should implement the best video technology possible and give expanded instant replay a try.Heck, it can\'t get be any worse than what we\'re seeing right now.Can it?kevin.cowherd@baltsun.comtwitter.com/kevincowherdsunListen to Kevin Cowherd Tuesdays at 7:20 a.m. on 105.7 The Fan\'s ""The Norris and Davis Show.""     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

Still without the many injured stars who fill out his roster, and now armed with a diminished version of C. C. Sabathia, Girardi has leaned on a collection of lesser lights who have had a knack for producing.It was more of the same Monday in their 6-4 victory over the Baltimore Orioles, as players like Lyle Overbay and David Adams helped set the stage for Vernon Wells, who drove in the go-ahead run in the 10th inning with a ground-rule double. Then again, some things never change, with Mariano Rivera recording his 625th career save.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no quit,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said of his team. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re excited to get to the ballpark every day, and they\xe2\x80\x99re finding ways to win.\xe2\x80\x9dIt was a resilient effort by the Yankees. Travis Hafner tied the game in the top of the ninth with a solo home run off Orioles closer Jim Johnson, who blew his third straight save opportunity, and Adams went 2 for 4 with his first major league home run. He also made some fine defensive plays at third base, which helped the Yankees offset another spotty start from Sabathia, who allowed four runs in six and a third innings.

It was not exactly slow, but it was not vintage Sabathia, and this has become a theme for the Yankees. With reduced velocity, Sabathia has been forced to rely on guile and pitch location to try to outwit opponents. Sometimes, it works. Sometimes, it does not. On Monday, he gave up 11 hits and struck out just two.\xe2\x80\x9cI was ahead of a lot of guys, and just didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the pitches,\xe2\x80\x9d Sabathia said, adding that he thought he left too many balls up in the strike zone, especially late in his outing . \xe2\x80\x9cIt was one of those days.\xe2\x80\x9d Photo       Yankees pitcher C.C. Sabathia allowed four runs in six and a third innings.  Credit             Patrick Semansky/Associated Press           The Yankees gave Sabathia a 3-2 lead in the top of the seventh when Overbay blasted a solo homer off reliever Troy Patton. But Sabathia could not hold it. In the bottom of the inning, he allowed run-scoring doubles to Nick Markakis and J. J. Hardy.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Both hits came on off-speed pitches. Markakis clobbered an 81-m.p.h. slider, and Hardy got his bat on an 83-m.p.h. changeup. Sabathia no longer possesses a huge gap in velocity between his fastball and his off-speed pitches, and hitters seem to be having greater success against him as a result. Because his fastball is no longer quite so fast, his slower stuff no longer appears quite so slow.

He helped himself by inducing two inning-ending double plays.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  After spending the 2011 and 2012 seasons with the Yankees, Garcia, 36, started this season with Class AAA Norfolk and showed enough promise for the Orioles penciled him into the rotation. His first three starts were forgettable. He had a 5.51 earned run average with two losses and a no-decision, having lost the ability to retire left-handed hitters with regularity. Girardi took note of this before Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game and packed his lineup with seven left-handed hitters.But aside from giving up two early home runs \xe2\x80\x94 solo shots to Robinson Cano and Adams \xe2\x80\x94 Garcia flummoxed the Yankees.Sabathia had no such success. The Orioles tied the game at 2-2 in the fifth when Steve Pearce led off with a double and Markakis drove him in with a single. Like Davis, Markakis made solid contact with a slider. \xe2\x80\x9cI just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put guys away,\xe2\x80\x9d Sabathia said.Still, the Yankees have persevered to vault themselves to the top of the American League East. Before Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game, Girardi recalled the season\xe2\x80\x99s opening week, when the Yankees lost four of their first five. Mark Teixeira, Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and Curtis Granderson were sidelined with various ailments, and Girardi was being peppered with questions about how he planned to repair a crumbling clubhouse.

CASILLA WANTS HIS FIST BUMP   A third base coach has a number of responsibilities - sending or holding runners, relaying signs, telling runners when to tag up, and so on. Another one is that he must give a runner a fist bump when he reaches third base. A runner is entitled to a bump even if he advances from second to third on a GIDP. If you steal second and scramble to third on the same play, putting the go-ahead run 90ft from home, and get your jersey dirty in the process then damn right you get a fist bump. Bobby Dickerson was derelict in his duty in this instance, to the point where Alexi Casilla was forced to insist. He eventually obliged with a half-hearted, distracted bump. Sheesh. That's nearly as egregious as withholding a home run hand-shake/high-five/fist-bump with optional butt pat.    ADAM JONES CATCH  Look at that! There were actually some good things that happened, including Gold Glove CF Adam Jones robbing a possible home run. Also see Chris Tillman's reaction.    MANNY PLAYS HARD TO GET   If you want that out you're going to have to chase Manny for it. Turns out that Manny wasn't just trolling the Padres here because Steve Pearce was rounding third and crossed home plate a few moments after the out was recorded. Allowing the runner to score would have produced another clip for the Extreme Heads Up Baseball with Manny Machado video compilation. Didn't quite work so it just landed in the LOLs bin.

The offense and the pitching have both had stretches where they\xe2\x80\x99ve been superior, maybe just not necessarily at the same time. Look at the positives, though. According to ESPN.com, the Orioles are 3rd in runs scored (212), 5th in slugging percentage (.440) and 5th in team batting average (.267), continuing the team-wide improvement. Pitching has been dealing with injuries and lack of a consistency starting rotation, but Jim Johnson has been (almost) lights out.

After a solid start this season, Johnson is struggling. Not coincidentally, so are the Orioles. Johnson blew his third straight save opportunity Monday night, and Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s losing streak reached six games with a 10-inning, 6-4 loss to the New York Yankees. New York trailed 4-3 in the ninth before Travis Hafner homered with one out on a 3-1 pitch from Johnson, who converted a franchise-record 35 successive save opportunities before his current slide. All three of those botched saves have come during Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s current skid. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other guys do their job and I do mine, then we\xe2\x80\x99re not standing here,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think everybody\xe2\x80\x99s doing a great job. I\xe2\x80\x99m just not pulling my weight. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll figure it out.\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only culprit. Starter Freddy Garcia allowed two homers and Troy Patton gave up one. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had trouble keeping the ball in the ballpark,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. Robinson Cano hit his team-high 13th home run in the first inning, David Adams clubbed his first major-league homer in the second and Lyle Overbay connected in the seventh. And then there was Hafner, who got hold of a fastball that was way too high in the strike zone. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had one bad pitch,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. In the 10th, Ichiro Suzuki led off with a double off Pedro Strop (0-2) and Vernon Wells followed with an RBI double to left. Hafner\xe2\x80\x99s two-out single made it 6-4. David Robertson (3-0) worked the ninth and Mariano Rivera got three straight outs for his 17th save in 17 tries. Johnson was 15 for 15 at one point. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s 15 for 18 after blowing save attempts against San Diego, Tampa Bay and the Yankees. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ball\xe2\x80\x99s up.

I\xe2\x80\x99m going to work through it.\xe2\x80\x9d After Overbay put New York up 3-2 in the seventh, Baltimore took the lead against Yankees starter CC Sabathia in the bottom half. Alexi Casilla singled and scored on a double by Nick Markakis, who came home on an opposite-field double to right by J.J. Hardy. Showalter elevated Hardy to the third spot in the lineup because the shortstop came in with a .321 career batting average against Sabathia. Hardy also doubled in the fifth against the big left-hander. Sabathia gave up four runs and 11 hits in 6 1-3 innings. He left with New York trailing 4-3, but Hafner\xe2\x80\x99s shot in the ninth preserved Sabathia\xe2\x80\x99s 17-4 lifetime record against Baltimore. Garcia, who pitched the past two years for the Yankees, allowed two runs, three hits \xe2\x80\x94 two homers and a meaningless single \xe2\x80\x94 in six innings. Aided by two double plays, the right-hander faced only three batters over the minimum. After Cano and Adams provided the Yankees with a 2-0 lead, Chris Davis hit his 13th homer for Baltimore in the second to make it 2-1. Garcia retired eight straight batters before Adams singled in the fifth. He was erased by a double play. After wasting a two-out double by Matt Wieters in the fourth, Baltimore pulled even in the fifth. Steve Pearce hit a leadoff double and scored on a single by Markakis. Later in the inning, Sabathia retired Adam Jones on a grounder with runners at second and third. Replays indicated first base umpire Eric Cooper got two calls wrong in the sixth inning, both of which went against Baltimore. Brett Gardner appeared to be picked off first base and was called safe, and Wieters seemed to beat out an infield hit but was called out. NOTES: Orioles RHP Miguel Gonzalez (blister on thumb) will return from the disabled list Tuesday night and start against the Yankees, who will have right-hander Phil Hughes on the mound. Hughes yielded seven earned runs in the first inning of his last start, against Seattle. \xe2\x80\xa6 Yankees 1B Mark Teixeira batted in a simulated game in Florida, testing his injured wrist for the first time since spring training. Also, 3B Kevin Youkilis (spine) took batting practice and fielded ground balls; 3B Alex Rodriguez (hip surgery) fielded grounders; INF Eduardo Nunez (oblique) did dry swinging and also took grounders; and RHP Ivan Nova threw 60 pitches in extended spring training. \xe2\x80\x9cAll our guys are increasing their activity.

For much of his herky-jerky season, it had been a pitch with extreme results. Unhittable one start and uncontrollable the next, the Hughes fastball had been as fickle as a windblown paper airplane. It has been a painstaking quest for him to prove he can throw it and produce results.So he approached his start against the Baltimore Orioles hoping to regain his rhythm. And though he never felt completely comfortable in the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 3-2 loss, especially coming out of his windup, he said he was encouraged that he was able to work through trouble.\xe2\x80\x9cHopefully I can take some steps forward from this one,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes said.The Orioles ended a six-game losing streak when Nate McLouth hit a game-winning homer off reliever Vidal Nuno in the 10th inning. It was a rare miscue from the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen. Nuno said he wanted to throw a cut fastball away from McLouth. It did not cut enough.\xe2\x80\x9cHe took advantage,\xe2\x80\x9d Nuno said.Hughes gave the Yankees six strong innings. He allowed five hits and two runs, while striking out five. He made two mistakes, surrendering two solo home runs to Chris Dickerson. Hughes did not figure in the decision, but his effort was cause for optimism amid an otherwise disappointing night for the Yankees. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m encouraged,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Joe Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cHughesy\xe2\x80\x99s run some pretty good streaks for us together. He hit a little rough spot. He\xe2\x80\x99s come out of them before, so there was nothing that led me to believe he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come out of it again.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Facing Seattle last Wednesday, Hughes could not escape the first inning. He gave up seven runs on six hits and two walks before Girardi removed him with two outs. Hughes threw 36 pitches, each with more disastrous consequences than the last. It was, he said, a humbling experience.On Tuesday, Hughes needed only 11 pitches to breeze his way through the first inning. It was clear from the beginning that Hughes wanted to lean on his fastball, though he said before the game that he would turn to his off-speed pitches if he was laboring with his location.

Credit             Nick Wass/Associated Press           Command has been his biggest challenge this season, particularly early in games. Hughes tends to overthrow, which causes his mechanics to crumble like a sand castle. When that happens, his arm flies loose, outpacing the movement of his lower body, and he releases the ball sooner than he should. The end result is often a fastball that hangs high over the plate, as hittable as a pi\xc3\xb1ata. Hughes described these pitches as \xe2\x80\x9cmistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  He made one in the third against Dickerson. He tried to get Dickerson to chase a two-strike slider, but Dickerson let the pitch pass for a ball. On the 10th pitch of the at-bat, Hughes uncorked a fastball that he left up over the outer half of the plate. Dickerson sent it over the wall in center.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The damage could have been worse. Later in the inning, Adam Jones flied out to the warning track with two outs and two on. Center fielder Brett Gardner made the catch with about two feet to spare. Such was the razor-thin margin between a solid start for Hughes and a potentially disastrous one.

Aside from those miscues, though, Gonzalez sailed along and went seven innings.

Girardi cited the right-hander Hiroki Kuroda, who has a knack for surviving even when he loses the feel for his slider. In Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s case, he might need to mix in more sliders and changeups when his fastball misbehaves. Girardi said he had no choice but to trust that Hughes would know when to alter his approach.\xe2\x80\x9cYou can try to enforce it, but the enforcer is standing there with the baseball in his hand,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIt falls upon his shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9dHughes was not impenetrable \xe2\x80\x94 he allowed four leadoff hitters to reach base \xe2\x80\x94 but he persevered.

Nate McLouth homered leading off the bottom of the 10th inning, Dickerson hit a pair of solo shots and the Orioles beat the New York Yankees 3-2 Tuesday night to snap a six-game losing streak.

Coming off a horrid start against Seattle in which the right-hander yielded seven runs and got only two outs, Hughes kept the Orioles in check \xe2\x80\x94 except for Dickerson. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he did OK,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe gave us a great chance to win the game.\xe2\x80\x9d Both bullpens matched zeroes until Nuno threw his third pitch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was supposed to be a cutter away,\xe2\x80\x9d the left-hander said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt felt a little bit off and he took advantage of it. One pitch and it cost us the game. Got to forget about it and get ready to pitch tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d Baltimore starter Miguel Gonzalez gave up two runs and five hits over seven innings, striking out five and walking none. The right-hander came off the disabled list before the game following an 18-day absence with a blister on his right thumb. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was fun to be out there again after two weeks being out and giving a chance to my team to win a ballgame,\xe2\x80\x9d Gonzalez said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that was fun, especially getting ahead of guys. That was important.\xe2\x80\x9d New York got a first-inning run when Brett Gardner doubled and scored on a two-out single by Hafner. Dickerson tied it with a drive to right-center on a 3-2 pitch. The Yankees quickly moved back in front. Vernon Wells led off the fourth with a double and Hafner followed with an RBI single. Dickerson\xe2\x80\x99s second homer of the game, leading off the fifth, made it 2-all. Gonzalez retired 11 straight batters before David Adams singled with two outs in the seventh. Lance Nix followed with a liner that right fielder Nick Markakis snagged with a dive. NOTES: To clear a roster spot for Gonzalez, the Orioles optioned RHP Jair Jurrjens to Triple-A Norfolk. Jurrjens started one game for Baltimore, receiving a no-decision Saturday against Tampa Bay. \xe2\x80\xa6RHP Hiroki Kuroda will start for New York on Wednesday night in the finale of the three-game series.

The move paid off as he sat the Yankees down in order.Nate McLouth then ended Baltimore\'s skid with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th, giving the Orioles a 3-2 win that ended a nightmarish start to this homestand during which the Orioles lost six straight games.BOX SCORE: Orioles 3, Yankees 2Over that span, closer Jim Johnson blew three consecutive saves for the first time in his career. After giving up the lead to the Yankees on Monday, manager Buck Showalter sent Johnson back out there Tuesday in the top of the 10th. But this wasn\'t the Johnson that struggled to control his sinker in recent outings. He was composed and pitched a perfect inning, leading to McLouth\'s blast in the bottom half of the frame.""Jimmy\'s an easy guy to trust,"" Showalter said of his decision to go back to his closer after his abysmal week.YANKEES: No A-Rod, Jeter, Teixeira? No problemThis was a game that Baltimore knew it desperately needed to win. Its last win came on May 12, and after Johnson blew the save Monday, that seemed like an eternity ago. But the Orioles finally put it all together, thanks to an impressive start from Miguel Gonzalez, which Showalter called the difference in the game.Successful starts have been rare for Baltimore this season \xe2\x80\x94 Tuesday was just the fourth time an Oriole starter has lasted seven innings or longer. Gonzalez exited with the game knotted at two after lasting seven innings and allowing five hits. He is now 2-1 with a 2.75 ERA against New York.""Sometimes you just feel comfortable against one team,"" Gonzalez said.

Last year\'s first-round draft pick, Kevin Gausman, will make his debut Thursday, according to reports.Tuesday was crucial for Johnson and the team\'s confidence as they ended their skid against the best team in the AL East no less. But the night was most special for Chris Dickerson, who homered twice for the first time in his big-league career against his former team.""I thought he was going to hit a third one,"" Showalter said, before adding perhaps he was just hoping that was the case.Instead, it was McLouth who hit the next one, halting the losing streak before panic sank in with a blast over the right-center field fence. Dickerson said the Orioles refused to let any pressure from the losing streak enter their minds.""Tomorrow\'s a new day,"" seemed to be a rallying cry as more losses piled up, which Dickerson said is imperative to turning the corner. But that\'s not to say they weren\'t weighing on the mind of the skipper.""It bothers you,"" Showalter said. ""You know there are a lot of people counting on you to make it an enjoyable summer.""Maybe, just maybe, the homestand that looked to be a lost cause can be salvaged with a series win over the Yankees on Wednesday.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com'), (""Splitting O's - Camden Chat"", "" I thought it'd be fun to use Baseball-Reference's Split Finder tool to see how the O's are doing in various situations. There's some interesting data and fun observations to be had here. All stats are through Sunday. Pitching Splits    Away: 3.81 ERA, batters are hitting .252/.319.388 against O's pitchers. Home: 4.87 ERA, batters are hitting .258/.341/.440. The offensive boost given by OPACY rears its head here. vs. right-handed batters: 3.93 ERA, batters are hitting .238/.315/.383. vs. left-handed batters: 4.74 ERA, batters are hitting .273/.346/.444. We see now where the damage is being done. Bonus split: lefty-on-lefty. 4.23 ERA, .260/.295/.418. O's lefties get hit pretty hard by left-handed batters. Not what you want to see.    Starters' splits by times through lineup:  First time faced: 3.87 ERA, .234/.311/.382.  Second time faced: 4.76 ERA, .263/.336/.432. Third time faced: 6.91 ERA, .311/.378/.547. Basically, if you face an Orioles starter for the third time in a game, you hit like Mike Trout. Yikes.   By first-pitch strike:   In plate appearances that begin in a 1-0 count, O's pitchers allow a batting line of .271/.385/.433. In plate appearances that begin in an 0-1 count, O's pitchers allow a batting line of .214/.270/.351. You can see the correlation of success and a first-pitch strike in these numbers.   The worst count for an O's pitcher to be in is, oddly enough, 1-2. In this count O's pitchers allow an OPS+ that is 21% worse than the rest of the league. (There are worse counts, but either the sample size isn't meaningful or the BABIP for those counts is too high.)  The best count for an O's pitcher to be in is 1-0. In this count O's pitchers allow an OPS+ that is 22% better than the rest of the league.   Batting Splits       Away: On the road, O's batters hit .273/.326/.451. Home: .256/.322/.418. You can see why the O's lose at home; the pitchers allow an extra run every nine innings and the hitters do worse than they do on the road. vs. RHP: .278/.340/.447. vs. LHP: .232/.286/.408. Why can't we hit lefties? Bonus split: lefty-on-lefty. .228/.282.368.  Against starters multiple times in a game:   First time faced: .300/.344/.533. The O's like to score early!  Second time faced: .236/.295/.398.  Third time faced: .284/.355/.420. It's fascinating to me that the second matchup is so bad but the third one is quite good.   By first-pitch strike:   In plate appearances that begin in a 1-0 count, O's batters hit .264/.372/.450. In plate appearances that begin in an 0-1 count, O's batters hit .256/.289/.394.  O's batters have done the best in even counts (0-0, 1-1, 2-2). In these counts, batters' OPS+ is 18% better than the rest of the league.  O's batters have done the worst in 0-1 counts. In this count, batters' OPS+ is 9% worse than the rest of the league.     "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The ball ricocheted off Kuroda\xe2\x80\x99s right leg and bounced toward third base for a single. Joe Girardi, the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 manager, made a beeline to the pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s mound from the dugout, a team trainer in tow.It was the beginning of the end for Kuroda in the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 6-3 loss to the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards, where Kuroda \xe2\x80\x94 so reliable this season \xe2\x80\x94 got completely battered, in more ways than one.Kuroda, who sustained what the team called a bruised right calf, left the game in the third. He gave up five runs on eight hits, his earned-run average swelling to 2.67 from 1.99. His record dipped to 6-3 as the Yankees capped their three-game series by losing their second straight.Girardi said he would be shocked if Kuroda missed his next scheduled start. Still, when Machado\xe2\x80\x99s line drive struck Kuroda on the fleshy part of his calf, Girardi could not help but have flashbacks of the comebacker that sent Andy Pettitte to the disabled list last season with a fractured ankle. Kuroda was fortunate. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a precaution,\xe2\x80\x9d Kuroda said of his early exit. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had to push myself, I might have continued to pitch.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  For the seventh time this season, the Yankees (28-18) turned to Kuroda after a loss, and Girardi had no reason to expect anything less than another sturdy effort. In his last outing, Kuroda allowed two hits in eight innings as he guided the Yankees to a win over the Toronto Blue Jays. But after leaning on pinpoint control throughout the early part of the season, Kuroda lacked his usual precision against the Orioles.\xe2\x80\x9cHe made some mistakes,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said.Most of them came in the first inning. It was a sign of things to come when Machado, hitting second, flew out to the warning track. Nick Markakis promptly stepped to the plate and demolished a slider, sending the ball over the center-field wall for a home run. After Adam Jones singled, Chris Davis turned on a sinker and delivered a two-run homer. Kuroda had not allowed a home run since May 7. Suddenly, only five batters into Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s start, he had given up two.

Credit             Doug Kapustin/Reuters           When Matt Wieters extended the inning with a double, Girardi felt it prudent to have the pitching coach Larry Rothschild pay Kuroda a visit. While Kuroda was able to escape without any additional damage, it was clear that he was dancing along the edge of a blade, with little margin for error.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Though his poor first inning was an anomaly, Kuroda has had a tendency to be more effective as games wear on. Opponents are hitting .299 against him in the first three innings this season. From the fourth inning on, however, they are hitting a microscopic .147.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Unfortunately for Kuroda, he never got the chance to work deep into the game against the Orioles. In the third, having already taken Machado\xe2\x80\x99s line drive off his leg, Kuroda gave up a double to Jones and a single to Davis. That hit ended Kuroda\xe2\x80\x99s night after 55 pitches, as Girardi summoned reliever Preston Claiborne to face Wieters with runners at the corners. Wieters pounced on Claiborne\xe2\x80\x99s second pitch, a fastball, and hit a three-run homer for a 6-1 lead. After the two teams split a pair of 10-inning games, Wieters\xe2\x80\x99s blast put a premature end to any drama.

Hammel\xe2\x80\x99s only problem was the emergence of Curtis Granderson, who entered the game with four hits in 23 at-bats since making his season debut last week.Granderson, who fractured his right forearm in spring training, went 3 for 3 with a walk, a double and a home run.\xe2\x80\x9cI liked how he was swinging the bat, and I felt like it was only a matter of time before he started getting some hits,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said.With Kuroda starting on the mound, Granderson\xe2\x80\x99s one-man show at the plate figured to give the Yankees a fighting chance. Kuroda has not needed much run support this season, but the Orioles had other plans.

How long Gausman remains its occupant will depend on how he pitches, but it\'s safe to say he can unpack his bag and stay awhile.The Orioles made a statement Tuesday, when it was first reported that Gausman, their first-round pick in last summer\'s draft, would be joining the big-league club. The statement wasn\'t that he would be debuting for Baltimore this season \xe2\x80\x94 manager Buck Showalter said it was always a matter of when, not if \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s that the call-up from Class AA Bowie (Md.) came so early into the season.Gausman, 22, will start Thursday against the Blue Jays in Toronto.""I hope it says that we\'re serious about winning every game,"" said Dan Duquette, the Orioles\' executive vice president of baseball operations. ""Our best players are going to come through the farm system.""Duquette added that he feels Class AA is the true ""proving ground"" for a pitcher\'s ability, though Showalter called the jump the ""biggest in professional sports."" Gausman pitched in eight games at Bowie this season, going 2-4 with a 3.11 ERA. He averages nearly 10 strikeouts per every one walk, and one of the reasons the Orioles were attracted to Gausman at the draft is his ability to consistently throw three pitches for strikes.""The hitters up here have more of a plan,"" Gausman said. ""They\'re smarter and they make adjustments. As a pitcher \xe2\x80\xa6 you\'ve got to make quick adjustments as well.""Frequently, teams fret over rushing young pitchers. But Showalter said the Orioles didn\'t need to take too many precautions with Gausman because ""you can\'t screw up the good ones."" Gausman stayed with the big-league club for the majority of spring training, which the Orioles said Tuesday was by design so that he\'d be comfortable when the call came.This isn\'t the first time Baltimore has opted to acclimate its top prospects to the majors sooner. Last August, 20-year-old shortshop Manny Machado made his debut and played a key role in the Orioles\' stretch run that ended in a playoff berth. Another prized pitching prospect, Dylan Bundy, appeared in two games as a 19-year-old last year.""We\'re trying to win,"" Showalter said.

It has definitely been out of the norm for Johnson, who was unsuccessful in just three save situations in 2012. But what makes it really unusual is that the three blown saves in 2013 came after a stretch where Johnson had converted a club-record 35 save opportunities over the past two seasons. According to Elias Sports Bureau, his save streak was by far the longest in major league history that ended with three straight blown saves. The previous record was held by Toronto\'s Tom Henke, who had 23 saves for the Blue Jays before blowing three straight in 1987.1.74 -- Kevin Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s ERA in his past five starts in Double-A. Is Gausman ready for the major leagues? We\'ll soon find out, but he has certainly been dealing against Double-A opposition over the past month. Gausman has allowed just one earned run in four of his past five starts. He allowed two in the other one. He has a 1.74 ERA over those five starts. He has 28 strikeouts in his past four starts, including a career-high 10 on Friday. In eight starts at Bowie, Gausman is 2-4 with a 3.11 ERA with 49 strikeouts and five walks. var adSkipCounter = 0; 34 -- stolen bases for the Orioles, most in the American League.Buck Showalter\'s Orioles didn\'t run much in 2012. They ranked last in the American League with 58 stolen bases, according to MASN. Adam Jones (16) and Nate McLouth (12) were the only Orioles with more than six steals. But in 2013, the Orioles have already stolen 34 bases, tops in the American League, on 42 attempts. Only the San Diego Padres and Milwaukee Brewers have more. McLouth already has 13 steals and Jones has eight on eight attempts.2.41 -- career ERA for Miguel Gonzalez against the Yankees.Miguel Gonzalez did not get the win Tuesday night, but he continued to have success against the Bronx Bombers. In four regular-season starts against the Yankees, Gonzalez is 2-1 with a 2.70 ERA. He has struck out 22 batters and walked six. The Yankees batted just .206 against Gonzalez in those starts. He also started one game against them in last year\'s playoffs, allowing one earned run over seven innings but getting a no-decision. Overall, Gonzalez has a 2.41 ERA against the Yankees, including playoffs..221 -- J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s batting average on balls put in play in 2013.After a sluggish spring and a slow start to the season, Hardy has been more productive in May. After going 0-for-4 on Tuesday night against the Yankees, the Orioles shortstop is batting .282 in the month of May with five home runs, four doubles and 11 RBIs. His average is still .234, but it could be better if the ball bounced his way more often. According to ESPN Stats and Info, Hardy leads the major leagues in percentage of swings resulting in a ball put in play at around 58 percent. But his batting average on balls put in play was just .221, a BABIP that ranks among baseball\'s lowest.Bloggers note: Have a nifty stat you want to share?

05/23/2013,"[(""Orioles' Manny Machado doesn't need smeared eyeblack ..."", 'BALTIMORE \xe2\x80\x93 He is just 20 years old having stormed inside a Washington-area beltway from a glamorous hometown where fantasy is the great commodity. Last fall, a baseball team rode his first taste at the major leagues to an improbable postseason.People marvel at the way he changed from his natural position to a new one in the big leagues. They say the switch was seamless. They gasp at his power. They adore his swing. They watch him now and they project a great future. They believe they were watching one of baseball\'s next great things.Except this is not Bryce Harper. The beltway is Baltimore\'s, not Washington\'s. The hometown is Miami, not Las Vegas. And the next great player, Manny Machado, plays third base having moved from shortstop.View photosAnd maybe if Machado was on the cover of Sports Illustrated at 16 or smeared eyeblack on his face like John Randle or ran face-first into outfield fences he would be a bigger deal. He would make headlines. He would lead highlight shows. He would be the biggest young thing in baseball.Instead, Machado is among the American League leaders with a .322 average. He\'s tied for the league lead in doubles, is tied for second in hits and sixth in total bases. He has been so good at third base, his Wins Above Replacement for position players, 2.6, was second-best in the league headed into Wednesday\'s game.""He has style, he just doesn\'t show it,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said Wednesday night after Machado had two more hits in a 6-3 Baltimore victory over the New York Yankees. ""He wants his substance to be his style and not his style be his substance.""In barely more than a year, baseball has seen its next generation emerge. The future everyone talks about involves Harper and Angels outfielder Mike Trout. It\'s easy to see why. Harper was clearly the best young player in the National League last year and Trout probably deserved to win the MVP with his 30 home runs and 49 stolen bases.Harper may be the best thing the game has to a sensation these days. His every move is news. His catapults into outfield walls have already become legend. Trout has a national commercial campaign at a time when most of baseball\'s biggest stars don\'t even get local commercials.But Machado, with only 97 games to his major league career, deserves to be in the conversation. He may not be Harper and Trout \xe2\x80\xa6 yet. He is also not far behind.""Which one would you want?"" one manager asked recently, considering the three and knowing that Machado will someday move back to shortstop. ""Knowing their positions and what they can do, which one would you take?""The implication being Machado, as a shortstop, would become the most essential of the three. Teams can always find outfielders. A shortstop who can both field and hit might be the most coveted player in the game, a cornerstone around which a team can build.On Wednesday, Orioles general manager Dan Duquette watched his young third baseman jog off the field after batting practice and smiled. He wasn\'t around when the team took Machado with the third overall pick of the 2010 draft, two spots behind Harper. He did oversee Machado\'s rise to the major leagues last summer and made the decision to play him in the big leagues at third.As much as anyone, Duquette understands Machado, realizes what he already is and what he can already be. And the smile lingered on his lips as he pondered the draft now almost three years in the past.""Maybe he wasn\'t No. 1 that year,"" he said of Machado. ""But maybe he was.""View photosThe Orioles never sweated their promotion of Machado last year. Much like they did in bringing 2012\'s No. 1 pick, pitcher Kevin Gausman, to the big leagues this week, they realized Machado was ready. They prepared him in empty minor league stadiums, having him field endless ground balls while staring at a basketball shot clock that ticked down the time he had to fire a throw to first. He handled it so well, they never doubted a decision to throw him into an American League East race at the most crucial time.If anything, Showalter is protective of Machado. He likes those moments when his franchise player shows bits of flair but he also wants to hide him in the protective cocoon of his clubhouse. If Machado isn\'t the lead story on every highlight show at 20 years old, well Showalter is fine with that. He is watching something bigger. Something better.Next week Machado and Harper will play against each other for the first time in a regular-season game. The series will come as controversy swirls around Harper for his style of play and some critical words from Nationals closer Rafael Soriano for being out of position on a double that cost Soriano a save on Tuesday in San Francisco. Machado almost disappears in the Orioles\' clubhouse. Just as a sparkling start to his major league career has barely drawn a ripple nationally.Let someone else run into outfield walls and wipe paint on their face.They\'ll be talking about Manny Machado soon enough.More sports news from the Yahoo!

The Baltimore center of gravity for this is of course Buck Showalter.

Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY SportsThough unable to have access to the clubhouse and see firsthand how Buck works with the players, it is safe to say that the guy we see in post-game interviews is likely the same fellow who sets the tone beyond the reach of the cameras. All of us have probably had the experience at some point in our lives of having to work in an environment with a Jekyll and Hyde sort of boss. You never know which of the several multiple personalities will be \xe2\x80\x9cout\xe2\x80\x9d that day or that moment. It makes for a difficult workplace.There is no shortage is the sport of baseball of successful fiery managers. In Baltimore, we need look no further than our own Earl Weaver \xe2\x80\x93 memorialized by the number \xe2\x80\x9c4\xe2\x80\x9d patch on the uniforms this year. Consider also such as Billy Martin, Tommy Lasorda, Bobby Cox, and Ozzie Guillen. The list could go on and on. Probably most of these guys could not manage this current flock of orange birds \xe2\x80\x93 Weaver as much as said so on several occasions.Though baseball differs greatly as a sport from, say, football or basketball, in terms of how a successful player needs to manage emotions and stay within himself much more, the current Orioles team is an extraordinary collection of mellow fellows. Think about it. Heading the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 all-mellow team are Nick Markakis, Jim Johnson, Matt Wieters, Miguel Gonzalez, Brian Matusz, Chris Davis, J.J. Hardy, Nolan Reimold, and Jake Arrieta to name a few. To find anything resembling a raucous personality, you have to look to the dry wit of Tommy Hunter or the fun-loving personality of Adam Jones. Overall, it is a rather flat-line group, and it certainly seems to me that Showalter is the perfect guy to guide such a team.The passionate fan will at times find this to be a bit maddening \xe2\x80\x93 especially during losing slides such as we recently saw. There is then a knee-jerk reaction to suggest that someone needs to light a fire under this team. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that will work with this group, as their fire is a steady pilot light within \xe2\x80\x93 far from plain view. However, a guy who might bring some new color to this rather bland landscape is tonight\xe2\x80\x99s starter Kevin Gausman, who by all reports has some eccentricities and interesting quirks of personality.All of this is to say that Orioles fans would do well to be a bit more emotionally mellow like the team, balancing the highs and lows. It is not a posture that comes easily to fans (a term that is short for \xe2\x80\x9cfanatics\xe2\x80\x9d). But there is no doubt that the past two games with wins and quality starts have given the residents of Birdland cause for a corporate sigh of relief. And we can hope for that trend to continue tonight. But don\xe2\x80\x99t expect Showalter to alter his show emotionally if it does, or does not. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Both teams have achieved a standing in their own leagues that makes their head-to-head showdowns have real meaning. Maybe not Orioles/Yankees or Nats/Braves real meaning, but certainly enough significance that we can start finding irrational reasons for fans of both teams to start hating each other. Bryce Harper\'s hair, for instance. Anyway, in the spirit of continuing to build a contentious relationship between the Mid-Atlantic\'s two major league franchises, here\'s our Tale of the Tape.Team historyOriolesThe old St. Louis Browns moved to Baltimore for the 1954 season and were renamed after a charming orange bird indigenous to the Mid-Atlantic region. In relatively short order, the team shed its long history of futility and became a dominant franchise in the American League, reaching the World Series six times from 1966-83 and winning world titles in \'66, \'70 and \'83. Known far and wide for developing great homegrown players and schooling them in a philosophy known as the ""Oriole Way."" var adSkipCounter = 0; NationalsThe old Montreal Expos moved to Washington for the 2005 season and were renamed to reflect their new standing as baseball\'s representative in the nation\'s capital. The original Washington franchise\'s nickname was ""Senators,"" but the newly relocated team chose not to re-adopt that name, probably because Major League Baseball enforces a strict debt limit and only allows spending on pork at the concession stands. The Expos and Nats have combined to reach the playoffs twice in 44 years and have a history of developing great homegrown players and quickly trading them to other teams.Edge: OriolesCurrent performanceOriolesThe Orioles entered the weekend with a 25-22 record and ranked third in the American League East, 3 \xc2\xbd games behind the first-place Yankees. They have been in a two-week slump in which they lost 8 of 11 games after climbing to a high-water mark of eight games over .500 in early May.NationalsThe Nats entered the weekend with a 24-23 record and ranked second in the National League East, four games behind the first-place Atlanta Braves. They have hovered around the .500 level for much of the early season and have never been more than five games above sea level. They also have been struggling of late, losing eight of their last 12 games going into the weekend.Edge: EvenTeam mascotOriole BirdThe Oriole Bird has become one of the best-loved mascots in professional sports since it was ""hatched"" at Memorial Stadium back in 1979, so this is its 35th season entertaining fans young and old at the ballpark and in the community. Even though it is one of the classic mascots, the Bird actually was ahead of its time, since it started tweeting decades before social media.ScreechThe Nats have a bird mascot, too. Screech is a bald eagle who was christened at the start of the team\'s first season in Washington (2005). He wears a Nats uniform and is not in any way related to the obnoxious character of the same name in the 1990s sitcom Saved By The Bell.Edge: OriolesTrading placesDan DuquetteOrioles general manager Dan Duquette made his name as a young baseball executive as the GM of the Expos, building a competitive team on a tight budget that had the best record in baseball when the 1994 season was ended prematurely by baseball\'s labor stoppage. He became the Orioles\' GM in 2011 and presided over the club\'s first playoff run since 1997.Davey JohnsonOf course, the man who led the Orioles on that wire-to-wire march to the postseason in 1997 was manager Davey Johnson, who took the O\'s to the playoffs in consecutive seasons as manager and also played in four World Series in an Orioles uniform during the team\'s glory years. He led the Nationals to the NL East title last season.Edge: NationalsTop young playerManny MachadoThird baseman Manny Machado hasn\'t gotten quite the level of hype that followed flamboyant Nats outfielder Bryce Harper to the major leagues, but he has quickly elevated himself into the same statistical realm as Harper and young Angels superstar Mike Trout. He entered the weekend batting .330 and leading the major leagues in at-bats and doubles while ranked behind only Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera in hits.Bryce HarperThere\'s no question that Bryce Harper is already a superstar, but if things don\'t work out for him in baseball, he can probably start his own line of rockabilly hair care products. The guy was the NL Rookie of the Year last year and he\'s going to be a force to be reckoned with for the next couple of decades, but he only trumps Manny in the home run column \xe2\x80\x94 with 12.

', 'articles.baltimoresun.com'), (""A look at Chris Tillman's success - Camden Chat"", "" Chris Tillman will take the mound for the Orioles tonight against the Toronto Blue Jays. With Wei-Yin Chen on the disabled list with an oblique strain and Jason Hammel struggling to return to his 2012 form, it's safe to say that Chris Tillman is currently the #1 pitcher on the Orioles. He wouldn't be a #1 on a lot of staffs, but he's ours and he's been pretty good this season. After starting 2012 in the minor leagues, Tillman made 15 starts for the Orioles starting July 4th. He was more successful than we'd ever seen him, pitching to 2.93 ERA and walking fewer batters than we'd ever seen from him. The advanced statistics that attempt to provide a more accurate picture for what to expect going forward didn't like him as much. Tillman's FIP was 4.68 4.25 and he had a pretty low BABIP at just .221. I don't think many of us (if any of us) expected Tillman to pitch to a sub-3.00 ERA in 2013 as he did in 2012, so the question was just how much would it go up and would he pitch well enough to keep his spot in the rotation? So far, Tillman has been successful. He has a 3.52 ERA, which is quite a bit better than average. FIP still doesn't like him, though, as he sits at 4.68 for that stat. There are pitchers who consistently out pitch their FIP (Jeremy Guthrie comes to mind), so hopefully for the Orioles that is what is happening with Tillman and he won't crash anytime soon. So what's going well so far for Tillman that can give us hope that he'll continue to pitch well this season? And what should we keep in mind as possible factors for a downturn?    Tillman's line drive rate of 21.4% is roughly the same as 2012 (21%), but so far this season he has been about dead even between fly balls (39.6%) and ground balls (39%). He's not close to being a ground ball pitcher, but his FB% is about 5% lower than it was in both 2011 and 2012. This is good news, since every ball hit on the ground is one less ball that could sail out of the ballpark. And with the above average defense of the infield behind him, those ground balls are even more likely to become outs.    Another thing I've noticed about Tillman this season is that his fastball seems much more effective. In 15 starts in 2012, Tillman's fastball was worth -4.6 runs above average (making it, of course, below average). So far in 2013 it has been worth 6.5 runs above average. That's quite a swing. The pitch value of his other pitches has dropped, which is disappointing, but since his fastball is thrown over 50% of the time, it's the pitch you want to get good results on for sure. His second-most thrown pitch, the curveball, is also positively rated. One possible stat to keep an eye on is Tillman's walk rate this season. At 3.52 it's not out of control, but of the pitchers who have made more than one start for the Orioles, only Jake Arrieta's is higher. It's one full walk per nine higher than it was last year, and that combined with his (slightly) higher HR rate of 1.34 could end up getting him in trouble.    Something else to keep in mind for Tillman is that he has a pretty high LOB% so far in 2013. At 83%, it's better than both the league average and Tillman's career average. If/when that drops, it could have an ugly affect on his ERA and on the team's chance to win when he's pitching. I'm not in the projecting business myself, there are just way too many variables for that. But I think there are good signs about Tillman this season and the truth is that, at least for the moment, he's the O's best bet for a good starting pitching performance.

It was intended for Baltimore Orioles outfielder Nick Markakis, and it was stained his standard black \xe2\x80\x94 except for Markakis\xe2\x80\x99s signature and the bat\xe2\x80\x99s name and model number, all of which were in pink. Nearby, in the Minnesota Twins\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse, third baseman Trevor Plouffe had just received a similarly marked bat.Both players planned to use their new bats in the Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day matinee that would conclude a three-game weekend series between their teams. In the end, they did not, barred by relatively new baseball guidelines that added a little bit of hard-nosed reality to what has become a once-a-season feel-good ritual in major league parks across the United States.Since 2006, pink bats have become a regular sight in Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day games, with hitters wielding them as part of an eye-catching effort to raise awareness for breast cancer charities.In the Orioles-Twins game, for example, 7 of the 18 players in the two starting lineups used all-pink bats. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      But Markakis\xe2\x80\x99s and Plouffe\xe2\x80\x99s newly delivered bats, manufactured by MaxBat, went unused. So, too, did bats belonging to Prince Fielder of the Detroit Tigers and Troy Tulowitzki of the Colorado Rockies, both of whom are clients of Tucci Lumber, which also made special bats for Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day with pink signatures and logos.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In each instance, the bats ran afoul of an edict issued by Roy Krasik, Major League Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s senior director for baseball operations. According to a memorandum he sent out in April and then reiterated two weeks ago to all of the bat companies used by major league players, companies were free to produce all-pink bats for Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day but only Hillerich & Bradsby, the makers of Louisville Slugger, the most widely used bat in baseball, could display its logo on the bats.The communications from Krasik also stipulated that the companies that were willing to produce logo-less pink bats were also expected to donate to baseball\xe2\x80\x99s designated breast cancer charity \xe2\x80\x94 Susan G. Komen for the Cure.Hillerich & Bradsby, which is based in Louisville, Ky., enjoys the designation of being baseball\xe2\x80\x99s official bat-maker, a title for which it pays Major League Baseball hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. That appeared to be one factor in its exclusive rights on Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day; another is its relationship with the Susan G. Komen charity.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Matt Bourne, a spokesman for M.L.B., said that Hillerich & Bradsby deserved extra recognition and support because of its efforts in bringing attention to breast cancer issues.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But because the guidelines did not explicitly forbid the other bat companies from providing special Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day bats that were not all pink but did have pink lettering, Tucci Lumber and MaxBat tried that route.

But when M.L.B. found out what MaxBat and Tucci Lumber were attempting to do, it banned those bats as well.

They were installed as part of the sport\xe2\x80\x99s latest collective bargaining agreement, reached in November 2011. That meant the ban on all non-Louisville Slugger logos was in effect on Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day 2012, although whatever attempts there were to skirt the rules last year did not get the attention they did this time around. Susan G. Komen for the Cure benefits directly from baseball\xe2\x80\x99s licensing arrangement with Hillerich & Bradsby. The charity\xe2\x80\x99s director of corporate relations, Carrie Glasscock, said that baseball mailed the charity a check for $63,114 last year and that a chunk of that amount represented the proceeds from the online sales of Louisville Slugger pink bats.Over the years, Hillerich & Bradsby has sold 33,000 pink bats online, with $10 from every sale \xe2\x80\x94 or $330,000 \xe2\x80\x94 going to baseball charities, said Rick Redman, the bat-maker\xe2\x80\x99s vice president for corporate communications.Pete Tucci, the owner of Tucci Lumber, and Anderson of MaxBat both said their companies were interested in being reliable supporters of the Susan G. Komen charity, and Tucci said it would be easier if he had the green light from baseball to make Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day bats with pink logos for more of his 60 major league clients.

Those bats can have the company logo printed on them since Major League Baseball has no comparable restrictions that apply to online sales.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The genesis of the pink bats appears to lie in a visit that John Hillerich IV, Hillerich & Bradsby\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, made to a subsidiary in Canada that produced pink hockey sticks for a National Hockey League breast cancer awareness campaign, Redman said. Hillerich suggested that baseball try the same idea with bats, and he quickly won support.This season, the company sent pink bats, for free, to more than 230 players \xe2\x80\x94 with each player getting two bats \xe2\x80\x94 up from about 120 when the promotion began in 2006, Redman said.

Orioles first baseman Chris Davis said that he keeps his pink bats to distribute to people he knows; the pink bat Davis used on Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day this season is no doubt more desirable for the homer he socked with it against the Twins.Before a game several weeks ago at Camden Yards, Davis\xe2\x80\x99s teammate, center fielder Adam Jones, said he distributed the bats to the women in his life. Down the hall, right fielder Jeff Francoeur of the visiting Kansas City Royals said he gave his pink bats to his mother, Karen.The Cleveland Indians\xe2\x80\x99 Nick Swisher used an all-pink bat that Tucci Lumber made specially for him on Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day.

Sokolowski-USA TODAY SportsMost of the faithful have established that Kevin Gausman\xe2\x80\x98s first Major League start was decent as far as it went Thursday, and a learning experience, which almost went without saying. One thing he may have learned was that when he gets in trouble, throwing his fastball harder is not the way out. It straightens out when it\xe2\x80\x99s faster, and the hitter can eventually catch up to it. Hitting 99, while impressive, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the be-all and end-all of pitching. He changed speeds effectively through the Toronto lineup the first time through, but the 4th and 5th innings gave him trouble, and the bullpen caved from there in a 12-6 loss.The Baltimore Orioles will give him more starts, beginning with, we presume, his next turn on Tuesday, and of course there is no way of knowing how they will work out, or how long he\xe2\x80\x99ll stay with the team. Speaking of things that go without saying, if he improves, he will help solidify the rotation.Friday night, the pitching left the spotlight and the hitting seized it. It was hard to decide on a star of the show, with Manny Machado going 3 for 6 and turning in four or five gorgeous defensive plays, and Chris Davis\xc2\xa0going 3 for 4 including his major league-leading, 16th home run. He was hitting .337 and slugging .723 coming into today\xe2\x80\x99s game.The 10-6 victory had a funny way of never seeming safe, as the Jays inched closer even while the Orioles added a 9th, and even a 10th run to their output. Chris Tillman gave up 10 hits and 3 runs in only 5 innings, and Brian Matusz followed by giving up 2 runs in only 2/3 of an inning of work. Then the recently reliable, and still reasonably so, Tommy Hunter gave up a homer and three other hits in his 2 2/3 inning stint. But Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xc2\xa0shut the door in the 9th inning.While most of Baltimore marveled at the wizardry of Machado and the power display of Davis, the Orioles braced for whatever would happen against the knuckleballing R.A. Dickey today. Machado joined Ty Cobb\xc2\xa0as the only players in history to have three hits in each of five consecutive road games before the age of 20, but he had his work cut out for him against the knuckler.Dickey and the Toronto bullpen held him hitless and kept Davis in the park. But J.J. Hardy, hitting third, singled in two first-inning runs and doubled later. Hardy is hitting .312 with 16 RBI in his last 19 games.\xc2\xa0Danny Valencia took advantage of one of his occasional starts by coming through with a 2-run homer, and Adam Jones\xc2\xa0added his third homer of the series and 9th of the year. This one may have been Jones\xe2\x80\x99 hardest hit ball of the season, a bullet off the facade of the third deck at Rogers Centre. It knocked Dickey out of the game in the 7th inning.But Steve Johnson, called up to replace Pedro Strop on the roster late Friday night,\xc2\xa0relieved\xc2\xa0Freddy Garcia\xc2\xa0in the 7th, and\xc2\xa0Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day replaced Johnson in the 8th, and the result was another uneasy feeling. The Jays closed a 6-3 Oriole lead to 6-5 in the 8th, but Jim Johnson got his 15th save with a 1-2-3 ninth. Strop was put on the DL with a lower back strain, but he had been ineffective (if one is generous, or rocked, to use another word) in several recent appearances. He gave up a grand slam in the 6th inning of Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s loss.Steve Johnson went through one of the most adventurous trips to Toronto any promoted minor leaguer ever had. The Orioles called him after midnight Friday night to let him know they were bringing him up, according to MASN commentator Dave Johnson, his father and a former Orioles pitcher.They called once to say they might, once to say they were not, and a third time to confirm they were doing it.\xc2\xa0They sent a car to Allentown, Pa., where\xc2\xa0Norfolk was playing the Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs, to pick him up about 2:30 a.m. and drive him to Philadelphia. From there, his 4 a.m. flight to Toronto was delayed.

In this case, I ruled the ball was caught by the first baseman, and the ball was actually caught by the pitcher,"" Nelson told a pool reporter before Saturday\'s game between the Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers. ""The pitcher kind of came out of nowhere on that play. I didn\'t pick that up. Obviously, looking at the replays, I wish I had.""The play was another in a series of missed calls made by umpires this season that has helped increase the call for expanded replay in baseball.WATCH: Is this the worst double play call in history?This one came in the second inning of Texas\' win Friday night and stymied a possible rally by the Mariners.Jesus Sucre hit a grounder to Mitch Moreland at first, who threw down to second to get the lead runner. The relay from Elvis Andrus back to first was in time to get Sucre but the throw was caught by pitcher Justin Grimm running to cover and not Moreland, whose foot was on the bag. Nelson missed that it was Grimm who caught the throw and called Sucre out.""Personally, I thought Moreland caught it. I didn\'t even know. I heard a couple innings later about what happened. It fooled me, too,"" said Seattle shortstop Brendan Ryan, who was in the on-deck circle when the play happened. ""That\'s maybe one of those things that maybe someone is upstairs and they pick up the phone and appeal it really quick. I\'m definitely not in favor of making these games 5 \xc2\xbd hours long. If I saw it that way, how could he not see it the same way? It looked very casual.""Nelson said his focus was on Moreland\'s foot and he never saw Grimm grab the throw. He wasn\'t the only one. Seattle manager Eric Wedge went out to argue that Moreland\'s foot had come off the bag, unaware that it was Grimm who caught the throw. Most of Seattle\'s dugout had the same reaction and only later found out about Grimm\'s grab.""I haven\'t seen a play like this in 25 years,"" Nelson said. ""Eric was very professional in how he came out. But there\'s never any consolation in a thing like this, because it\'s your job to get it right. We\'re competitive, too, and we want to get things right. So I\'d love to say it makes you feel better, but you\'re angry just like everybody else that you ruled otherwise.""Nelson\'s mistake was the latest in a string unwanted attention for umpires. Two weeks ago, Fieldin Culbreth was suspended for two games because he was in charge of the crew that allowed Astros manager Bo Porter to improperly switch relievers in the middle of an inning.A day before Culbreth\'s mistake, Angel Hernandez and his crew in Cleveland failed to reverse a clear-cut home run after looking at a video review. MLB executive vice president Joe Torre said the umpires made an ""improper call.""And in early May, crew chief Tom Hallion was fined after getting into a verbal spat with Tampa Bay pitcher David Price.Nelson declined to talk about replay, but Wedge said it seems inevitable that replay will expanded in some capacity.""I think we are pushing toward it. Some of that is going to be inevitable. It just has to be tempered,"" Wedge said. ""I think that\'s where everybody struggles is where do you draw the line. I\'ve always been a big believer in the human element of it, but I think there is a place for the replay.""PHOTOS: PLAYERS, MANAGERS GET EJECTEDFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInMLB players, managers get ejected\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Encina, The Baltimore SunTORONTO \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 Orioles catcher Matt Wieters, who entered Sunday\'s afternoon game against Toronto with just three hits in his past 25 at-bats, hit out of the No. 7 spot in the series finale.It marked the first time Wieters has hit that low in the Orioles\' batting order since last June 30.It proved to be a nice fit for the day. Wieters recorded his first four-hit game of the season in the O\'s 6-5 loss to the Blue Jays at the Rogers Centre.Wieters, who was coming off a day off behind the plate, drove in three runs and hit three doubles in the game, including a clutch two-run double off Toronto right-handed reliever Steve Delabar in the ninth inning that gave the Orioles a 5-2 lead at the time. var adSkipCounter = 0; ""I was just able to get some fastballs in the middle of the plate and get a barrel to them,"" Wieters said.The switch-hitting Wieters, who is hitting just .207 this season from the left side, hit all three doubles off right-handed pitching. His opposite-field second-inning double off starter Chad Jenkins gave the Orioles a 2-0 lead. He added a leadoff double in the sixth off right-handed reliever Thad Weber.""We\'re just going to take it one day at a time and hopefully we can carry on some,"" Wieters said. ""But each day is a different pitcher, different everything.""Bundy progressingAll signs continue to be positive in Orioles top pitching prospect Dylan Bundy\'s recovery from right forearm and elbow stiffness.Orioles manager Buck Showalter said Bundy continues to have full range of motion without pain in his right arm after he received a platelet rich plasma injection.Showalter said if everything continues to go well, Bundy will be able to resume throwing June 10. Before he is cleared, he will have another visit with Dr. James Andrews, Showalter said.Bundy, ranked the second-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America, hasn\'t pitched in a regular-season game this year.Ready for interleagueShowalter\'s made it no secret that he\'s not a fan of interleague play, but the Orioles will open a two-game road series in Washington on Monday.Since they\'re playing in a National League park, pitchers will hit for the first time this season. Pitchers took early batting practice during last week\'s homestand.""We\'re as ready as we\'re going to be,"" Showalter said.Showalter said the biggest adjustment is scouting an unfamiliar opponent.""You\'re trying to play Toronto, but we\'ve already started stumping for them,"" Showalter said before Sunday\'s game. ""You\'re calling in a lot of markers. The game is the game, it\'s played in 90 feet, but the biggest thing is trying to familiarize yourself with the players and make sure our players feel like the only thing that is going to challenge them is the game itself.""They\'re one of the best teams in baseball. You look at the teams we\'ve drawn in interleague play [and] it hasn\'t been kind to us. \xe2\x80\xa6 It\'s a place we\'ve played before so it\'s not as much adjustment as it\'s been before.""Wada updateLeft-hander Tsuyoshi Wada allowed three runs on four hits over five innings, walking four and striking out six, in his third minor league rehab assignment with Triple-A Norfolk.In his three starts with the Tides, Wada is pitching to a 5.54 ERA and has allowed eight earned runs over 13 innings.The Orioles have until June 15, when his 30-day minor league rehab window expires, to decide what to do with Wada. He could contribute as either a reliever or starter, but there is a clause in his contract that doesn\'t allow the Orioles to option him to the minors without his approval.Around the hornThe Orioles have recorded a home run in seven straight games. \xe2\x80\xa6 They\'ve scored five or more runs in nine straight road games, most since a nine-game streak from July 19-Aug. 8, 1998. \xe2\x80\xa6 Manny Machado has hit safely in eight of his past nine road games and 15 of his past 17. He also recorded his fourth multi-hit game in his past five and his overall this season. \xe2\x80\xa6 Nick Markakis extended his hitting streak to 11 games. \xe2\x80\xa6 Shortstop J.J.

05/27/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Should Jim Johnson have been pulled?', 'The question posed in the title is obviously rhetorical in nature. However if you\xe2\x80\x99re truly going to ask that question following yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s 6-5 walk off loss in Toronto, it would have to be the follow up. The real question would have to be should Jim Johnson have been in the game to begin with. I think most people would answer affirmatively, especially after Johnson shut down Toronto in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s save. However keep in mind that when teams go to their closer they rarely do so with someone else warming up in the bullpen.Courtesy of John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY SportsYour closer is supposed to be just that; the guy that closes out the game. Granted Johnson blew this one (his fourth blown save in five attempts). However it\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to say\xc2\xa0they should have brought Patton or Steve Johnson into the game.\xc2\xa0But with nobody warming up behind (Jim) Johnson, how exactly could Showalter have suddenly just gone to the \xe2\x80\x98pen and lifted Johnson? So again, the real question is whether or not you believe Johnson should have been in the game. If the answer is\xc2\xa0yes, I was comfortable with them bringing Johnson in, then you should know that Showalter couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone to the pen again. (It\xe2\x80\x99s also worth mentioning that especially on the road, managers will rarely get anyone up off the bench in the \xe2\x80\x98pen because the home team gets the last at-bat.)Unfortunately the Baltimore Orioles wasted a great pitching performance by Miguel Gonzalez, who gave up one run. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.2 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 3 BB, 7 K. The only issue with Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s performance is of course that he only went 5.2 innings yesterday, however bear in mind that with Toronto winning in walk off fashion against the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 closer that bore very little relevance in the outcome. The Birds took a 2-0 lead in the second on Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-double and Danny Valencia\xe2\x80\x98s fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice-RBI. Brett Lawrie\xe2\x80\x98s sacrifice fly-RBI in the fourth cut that lead to 2-1, however Adam Jones put the Orioles ahead 3-1 with his fourth home run in as many games at Rogers Centre in the top of the seventh.What will go forgotten in this game is Tommy Hunter\xe2\x80\x98s\xc2\xa0bend but don\xe2\x80\x99t break\xc2\xa0effort in the eighth inning. Granted Hunter loaded the bases and gave up a run to cut the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead to 3-2. However Hunter induced Melky Cabrera to ground into a force out at home plate, and Jose Bautista grounded back to Hunter for a putout at first base to end the inning. Hunter unfortunately bare handed the ball on the skip, and immediately went to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse for x-rays (which came back negative). Nevertheless, had the O\xe2\x80\x99s been able to win the game that effort would be standing out as huge in the grand scheme of the ballgame.The Orioles thought they had all but put the game out of reach in the 9th inning when Matt Wieters doubled home Nick Markakis and Adam Jones. That put the Orioles ahead 5-2, and in a good position going to the last of the ninth. However they aren\xe2\x80\x99t the only team to play until the final out. J.P. Arencibia singled home Juan Encarnacion to cut the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead to 5-3, and Adam Lind scored on a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice. However Munenori Kawasaki\xe2\x80\x98s two-RBI double scored two runs off of Johnson, and the Orioles fell in walk off manner, 6-5.I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that the Orioles and their fans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be concerned about Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s ability to close out games. Not only has he blown four of five saves, but he blew a three-run lead today. However let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that the O\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t get swept in Toronto this weekend by any means. They lost a game they had no business losing, however that happens in a division as competitive as the AL East. Some people are going to read this and be pretty angry in that it comes across as if I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that Orioles fans should sit back and accept things as they are. I get that, and I understand it. However at Birds Watcher we try to look at things in a more cerebral manner as opposed to emotional. Going back to that rhetorical question, should Showalter have yanked Johnson when things went south? Um, again\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s only the follow up, because if the answer is yes what you\xe2\x80\x99re really saying is that Johnson shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even been in the game.I actually thought that at the beginning of his outing Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s sinker was sinking fairly well. I also think that things snowballed on him a bit, and he found himself in situations where he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t throw all of his pitches. In other words, he got behind in the count. Pitching from ahead in the count is imperative to closers, and Johnson is no exception. The Orioles this afternoon will travel to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital to take on the Washington Nationals in game one of the \xe2\x80\x9cBattle of the Beltways.\xe2\x80\x9d Jason Hammel will start against Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Gio Gonzalez. The Orioles will need Hammel to go as deep as he can this afternoon, as the bullpen might be short-handed with Tommy Hunter having bare handed that ball yesterday, and Johnson having thrown 37 pitches.Courtesy of Randy Sartin-USA TODAY SportsWith all of that said, I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s veterans on this Memorial Day, 2013. My late grandfather, Dr. Anthony Launi, served in WWII and was later a catcher in the Washington Senators\xe2\x80\x99 minor league system before settling in Bethesda, MD to become a dentist.

Both are chasing some of the better teams in baseball right now with the Nationals trailing only the red-hot Braves in the NL East and the Orioles trailing the Red Sox and the Yankees in the AL East.But go beyond the records and it\'s obvious that these teams have taken different trajectories to get where they are. Monday\'s 6-2 Orioles win at Nationals Park represented something of a microcosm for both teams\' seasons.Washington, which nearly every expert tapped preseason to win the division and contend for a pennant, has primarily underachieved, due in no small part to injuries along the way. But in a thin NL East, the Nationals probably only have Atlanta to worry about.The Orioles, viewed as candidates for regression after a surprise wild-card berth in 2012, have defied prognosticators and are now 27-23. But for all their success, the Orioles are in the midst of a divisional dogfight, trailing both Boston and New York with Tampa Bay lurking.Monday\'s game began a nine-game out-of-division stretch for the Orioles, a day after  after a difficult loss at Toronto in which closer Jim Johnson coughed up a three-run ninth-inning lead.Faced with a vulnerable Nationals team, Baltimore took full advantage.""It just shows our resiliency and the type of character we have in this clubhouse,"" said Baltimore starter Jason Hammel, who pitched what he described as his best game of the season, completing eight innings, giving up eight hits and striking out eight.The most glaring problem facing the Nationals is their lack of offensive production, even against far less dominating pitchers than Hammel. Washington, which won more games than any team in the majors last season, has scored fewer runs this year than all but two teams \xe2\x80\x94 the Marlins and the Dodgers, two teams in the cellar of their respective divisions.At this point in 2012, Washington was 28-19, holding a 2 1/2-game lead in the division.The Nationals are also currently third from the bottom in both leagues with their .230 batting average. Things have gotten so bad in Washington that manager Davey Johnson has vowed not to shave his face until the bats heat up. And with the news that slugger Bryce Harper is still being bothered by a banged-up knee and will likely be affected by the injury all season, Johnson\'s beard might be here a while.For all that has gone wrong for the Nationals this season \xe2\x80\x94 from Harper\'s encounter with the Dodger Stadium fence to ace Stephen Strasburg\'s less-than-stellar start to the year \xe2\x80\x94 there\'s still reason for optimism.Baltimore, which clubbed 15 hits Monday, is second in the majors in batting average (.273). Just as the Nationals might still yet play to their potential (and probably will as soon as what can only be described as a two-month slump ends), the Orioles could still see a minor fall back to earth. That\'s what they seemed fated for when they lost six straight in the middle of this month. But since, Baltimore has taken five of seven, surviving what Showalter called an ""every-day grind"" with 10 consecutive games against divisional foes now behind them.""We\'re on a roll right now,"" said Baltimore right fielder Nick Markakis. ""This was a great team win.""Tuesday, the Nationals will pitch 25-year-old Nathan Karns, one of their top pitching prospects who will be making his major-league debut after just nine starts at Class AA. He\'ll face a youngster who recently made that jump in Baltimore\'s Kevin Gausman.But the reasons behind  those  roster moves epitomize both teams\' current states. For Washington, it was borne of necessity, with lefty Ross Detwiler on the disabled list with an oblique injury and no reliable veteran hand available. Even his manager showed some degree of uncertainty when asked if Karns was ready.""It\'ll be a good test,"" Davey Johnson said. ""We\'ll find out.""For the Orioles, calling up Gausman was more like a welcome party. He struggled a bit in his first start in Toronto when he lasted five innings and allowed seven hits and four runs. But he was summoned on the Orioles\' terms.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com')]"

Say, how did it go the last time the O's faced an AA call-up? Karns is a right-hander, which, as you probably know by now, bodes well for lefty batters, and also Adam Jones and Manny Machado, who enjoy nice reverse platoon splits.

Note the absence of Bryce Harper for a second straight game. He has fluid in his knee, which sounds kind of gross. This is called bursitis, which you may have already known. That also sounds gross, and similar to the bursar's office, which anyone who has ever attended college knows is gross as well. Harper may be seen as the DH as this series moves to Camden Yards tomorrow.

Facing a total of 27 batters, he gave up only three hits while holding the Nationals scoreless over eight innings. Of those 27 batters, Garcia threw a strike on the first pitch to 21 of them. He only had one 2-0 count and one 3-0 count, battling back to get both hitters. Garcia had good command of all his pitches, with lots of movement and placement on the edges. Throwing strike one allows a pitcher to work the corners and make the hitters chase his pitches on his terms.

I understand the ideas behind this decision. Other teams can't do it because they don't share a regional sports network the way the O's and Nats do, so it's unique.

I don't care about their players and I'm not interested in people doing The Shark in the stands or whatever.  As an Orioles fan, I also have to listen to the O's announcers educate the Nationals fans on the Orioles players. 1) I already know everything they are saying, and 2) I know that the Nationals fans don't care about the Orioles players any more than I care about the Nationals players. So instead of a regular broadcast, fans of both teams are stuck with an elementary school lesson on the players and none of the enjoyable back and forth banter that revolves around our team and includes the announcers that have built a rapport with each other over the years.    But that's not where it ends. I'm not asking for the announcers I'm watching to be homers necessarily, but their calling of the game should be geared towards the team I'm watching. I live in the local broadcast area and pay good money to a cable company so that I can watch all of my team's games on the local channel. So why does it feel like I'm watching an away game? Last night, when Chris Davis hit his second home run of the game to make the score 9-6 in favor of the Orioles, it should have been an exciting moment in the broadcast booth. The crowd was going wild and the Orioles had just completed a crazy comeback. But instead of Jim Hunter or Gary Thorne in the booth to excitedly give O's fans the moment they want, it was Carpenter's turn in the booth and he called it with as much enthusiasm as you'd expect many announcers of the other team to do. It kind of ruined the moment. Now, I don't blame Carpenter for this. If I were a Nationals fans watching the broadcast on MASN, the home of the Nationals, and had to listen to an excited call of a home run that put the nail in the coffin for my team in the game, I would be equally annoyed.    It all boils down to this: fans of different teams need different kinds of broadcasts for their teams. The way it's set up now it feels like both teams are being forced to watch the broadcast by an opposing team's guys. Except that we're all watching it on MASN, which is the hometown cable network for our favorite team, be it the Orioles or the Nationals. The way it is set up now is a disservice to everyone. I hope that MASN will do the right thing and end this experiment after the 2013 season. They have two stations so that they can broadcast two games, and that's what they should do even when the Orioles and Nationals are playing each other.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Davis playfully instructed Cano not to hit any home runs against the Orioles; Cano probably should have made the same request of Davis on behalf of the Yankees.As it turned out, Cano, as the second batter of the game, promptly slammed a Freddy Garcia pitch into the left-field seats. The next inning, Davis pulled a C. C. Sabathia offering over the wall in right.It was two innings of one game, but it is quite possible this back and forth could go on all season, the teams battling for first place, or at least a wild-card spot, in the American League East, while Cano and Davis, two left-handed sluggers, go tit for tat at the plate.That Davis might even be on equal footing with Cano, one of the established stars of baseball, is remarkable. Originally known for striking out as much as anything else (every 2.98 at-bats in his first five seasons), Davis did not really come into his own until last season, when he hit 33 homers, drove in 85 runs, hit a respectable .270 and helped the Orioles reach the postseason for the first time in 15 years. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      And this season, the 27-year-old Davis has left last year in the dust. Going into Friday\xe2\x80\x99s games, he led the major leagues with 19 homers and sat at or near the top of the American League with 37 extra-base hits, 141 total bases, a .754 slugging percentage and a 1.195 on-base plus slugging percentage (all first); 50 runs batted in (second); and a .353 batting average (third).  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Davis is doing it by walking more (he is already approaching last year\xe2\x80\x99s meager 37), striking out less and exhibiting a smooth stroke with immense power to all fields. Davis, said Orioles pitcher Tommy Hunter, who was acquired with Davis in a 2011 trade with the Texas Rangers, is a \xe2\x80\x9cvery powerful individual.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cChris\xe2\x80\x99s contact-to-damage ratio is very good,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said in more of an understatement, then added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not messing with Chris a lot now. I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving him alone.\xe2\x80\x9dAs for Davis himself, he has a simple explanation for his big numbers this season. \xe2\x80\x9cBeing patient and swinging at strikes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that as a pure hitter, any time you increase your contact, there\xe2\x80\x99s a better chance of putting the ball out of the ballpark.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Davis\xe2\x80\x99s coaches and teammates think that his settling in at first base has helped account for what, so far, is a stunning season. In 2012, Davis bounced among first base, right field, left field and designated hitter for the Orioles, and he even pitched two scoreless innings of a 17-inning game at Fenway Park last May, earning a victory. In previous seasons, Davis played some third base, too.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Overshadowed by his full-bore hitting is that he is also playing a smooth first base, which is one reason Baltimore leads the American League in fielding percentage. In the three games against the Yankees last week, he repeatedly dug balls out of the dirt to prevent throwing errors and infield hits. In the final game, he completed a double play by stretching out almost parallel to the right-field line, his right foot somehow touching the base as he snagged the relay from second.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Davis\xe2\x80\x99s defensive improvement derives in part from drills overseen by the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 third-base coach, Bobby Dickerson. Every morning during spring training, Dickerson hit Davis balls that short-hopped him, or used a machine to do the same. During the regular season, before games, Dickerson positions Davis at first base and raps difficult grounders from third.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make him think like a catcher,\xe2\x80\x9d Dickerson said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe lets the ball come to him; he receives pitches.\xe2\x80\x9d [{""headline"":""Sports"",""summary"":""Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, delivered to your inbox every week."",""product-code"":""SP"",""product-title"":""Sports"",""sample-url"":""http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/newsletters\\/sample\\/sports?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=SP&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up""},{""headline"":""Race\\/Related Newsletter"",""summary"":""Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with New York Times journalists."",""product-code"":""RR"",""product-title"":""Race Related"",""sample-url"":""http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/newsletters\\/sample\\/race-related?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=RR&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up""},{""headline"":""Your Money"",""summary"":""Every week, get tips on retirement, paying for college, credit cards and the right way to invest."",""product-code"":""MY"",""product-title"":""Your Money"",""sample-url"":""http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/newsletters\\/sample\\/your-money?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=business&contentId=MY&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up""}]      Please verify you\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

At one time a part of the heralded cavalry, ranked as the 67th-best prospect in MLB by Baseball America prior to the 2009 season, Arrieta now finds himself exiled to AAA Norfolk after a fourth year of failure at the MLB level. Has he finally worn out the patience of the Orioles? While as long as Andy MacPhail was the GM, Arrieta and the other struggling once-bright pitching prospects seemed to have infinite chances, Dan Duquette is not wedded to those players in the same way. Duquette has stocked the AAA ranks with any veteran or once-promising starter from elsewhere. At the end of last year, Arrieta found himself stuck in the bullpen in September while the surprising Miguel Gonzalez, and unlikely trade acquisition Joe Saunders, held down spots in the rotation that powered the Orioles into their first playoff berth in fifteen years. This season, a solid spring training left Arrieta at the top of the heap of the fifth-starter candidates. He would be given the first chance to fail. With the opportunity to fail in front of him, one cannot say that Arrieta failed to seize it. In four starts, he never pitched more than five innings. Two walks became four, four walks became five, culminating in a four-inning, five-walk effort against the Dodgers on April 21, after which Arrieta was demoted to Norfolk.    Arrieta has stayed with the Tides, languishing as the likes of Josh Stinson, Steve Johnson, Zach Britton, and Freddy Garcia were shuffled through the Baltimore rotation. Garcia may stick. They had so little faith in Arrieta figuring anything out in AAA that they would rather throw Kevin Gausman straight from AA to the majors than give Arrieta another try.    At the age of 27, Arrieta is no longer a young man in baseball prospect years. If he were improving, we would say that he was still a pitcher in his prime, but he has never improved. He has done the opposite of improve: every year his ERA at the MLB level has gotten worse, going from a 4.66 in 100.1 IP in 2010 to a 6.20 ERA in 114.2 IP last season to a 6.63 in his four starts this season. The common wisdom about Arrieta was that if he could just improve his strikeout rate and cut down his walk rate, he would be able to be more successful. A 2011 K/9 of 7.01 went to 8.56 in 2012, and his BB/9 was cut from 4.45 in 2011 to 2.75 in 2012. Yet his ERA still rose from an already-unacceptable level.    Was it bad luck? Opposing batters hit .320 on balls in play (BABIP), which is an outlier for pitchers generally, and he only stranded 57.3% of baserunners, which is also an outlier. Arrieta having bad luck is one explanation. Throwing hittable pitches is another, and losing his composure once men got on base is still another. One bad error, one lucky bloop hit, these things were not Arrieta's fault. The meltdown that seemed to inevitably follow it, that was always his fault. Perhaps the quintessential Arrieta plate appearance starts out with an 0-2 count against a left-handed batter. He gets cute, bounces a curveball the batter does not swing at. A pitch near the zone is fouled off. Another curveball in the dirt. More fouls. He cannot get the guy to swing and miss. A fastball misses its target. More fouls. Then the last fastball goes straight down to the ankles and the batter trots to first base. Nobody can work an 0-2 walk like Jake Arrieta. Left-handed batters are the struggle for Arrieta. He has never been able to adapt his arsenal to retire them. Though Arrieta was a ranked prospect for a time, he was never a sure thing. This is why it took until the fifth round for him to be drafted. Several other right-handed pitchers who've seen significant MLB action were taken in the first couple of rounds of that 2007 draft. I am not differentiating between prep pitchers and college pitchers. You can see what separates the successful ones from the others:   Pitcher RHB OPS LHB OPS Career ERA   Jarrod Parker .694 .728 3.87   Blake Beavan .726 .859 4.67   Rick Porcello .709 .814 4.61   Tommy Hunter .715 .846 4.60   Jordan Zimmermann .677 .694 3.32   Jake Arrieta .666 .864 5.40     Arrieta is more successful than any of these guys in terms of keeping down the OPS of righty batters - but he's the worst against lefty batters out of all of them. Some of the ERA differences can be explained by park differences, as well: Parker's home ballpark is Oakland, Beavan's is Seattle. Meanwhile, Hunter has gone from Arlington to Camden Yards. Still: Parker and Zimmermann have smaller platoon gaps. They are the pitchers who have done well. This is probably not a coincidence. The problem is even more pronounced when you break it down to home and away. Arrieta has faced lefty batters at Camden Yards 475 times. This is the slash line of those batters: .300/.384/.558. This is approximately equivalent to Mike Trout. Lefty batters against Arrieta in Baltimore have hit as well as the best player in the American League hit last season. They probably stole fewer bases than Trout once they reached, because of Wieters. There are no perfect comparisons, okay. Whatever your opinion of the competence of the Orioles organization in recent years, you can be sure that the people who mattered in MacPhail's regime and who matter now in Duquette's were aware of the problem for Arrieta. If it were so easy to know the problem in order to fix it, they would have fixed Arrieta by now. Maybe he needed to learn another pitch; maybe command of his existing pitches is the root of his problem. Maybe, like Hunter, he is destined for the bullpen. Duquette has not been shy about turning failed starters he inherited from the MacPhail years into relievers. Hunter and Brian Matusz have both thus far been success stories. Why not Arrieta? It is hard to trust a reliever who can't throw strikes: see Pedro Strop for why that is. As a starter, Arrieta has never managed to be able to throw strikes that are not hit hard. Perhaps they still are trying to salvage Arrieta as a starter, and they know he needs more work at what they are having him work on. Perhaps the reason they haven't sent him into the bullpen is they just no longer care about him. He could be a spare part to be traded for someone else's spare part, or, if they are tired enough of him, non-tendered at year's end, or even designated for assignment sooner than that. There's always someone out there willing to give another chance to an arm like Arrieta. They can convince themselves they have just the guy to teach Arrieta just the thing to have some value to the team. Joe Jordan, the scouting director when Arrieta was drafted, might like another shot at one of his overslot signings now that he's director of player development in Philadelphia. Any struggling team may try to take a flier on a cheap player who, you never know, could just really need a change of scenery. Arrieta is not even arbitration-eligible yet, and given how his career has gone so far, will not be so expensive even as that process plays out. Stranger things have happened in the annals of baseball scrap heap acquisitions. No one can ever know the mind of Duquette. I sometimes wonder if even Duquette knows the mind of Duquette. That said, the Orioles' treatment of Arrieta this year suggests that their patience may have finally run out with him. Once a part of the cavalry, Arrieta rode into town with bugles blaring and fans cheering in all directions. He may not be long from a lonely ride out of town on a beaten down old horse, without a single friendly face to bid him farewell.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""Freddy Garcia pitches a gem as O's sweep Washington"", 'Going into last night\xe2\x80\x99s game there was no reason to believe that the Baltimore Orioles would end up inning a pitchers duel. Not only did the O\xe2\x80\x99s have flyball-happy Freddy Garcia on the mound, but they were fresh off of a 6-2 win on Monday, a 9-3 loss on Tuesday, and of course Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 9-6 comeback win (all against Washington). I think that people expected the ball to be popping again, however what we ended up seeing was an old fashion pitchers duel between Garcia and Washington starter Dan Harren. Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s line: 8 IP, 0 R, 3 H, 0 BB, 6 K. Harren wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far behind in his stats, however the Birds were able to put up two runs on him which was all they needed to win.In a nutshell, Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x98 third inning RBI-double gave the Orioles a 1-0 lead. Manny Machado gave the Birds an insurance run in the eighth with Jim Johnson warming in the bullpen, as his RBI-double scored Nate McLouth. The only time that Washington really threatened in the game was in the second inning when they had two runners in scoring position withe one out. However Garcia induced Chad Tracy to send a lazy popup to shallow left field (which was not deep enough for the runner at third to tag up), and Kurt Suzuki popped up to J.J. Hardy at short to end the threat.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough that can be said about how Garcia pitched last night. With perhaps the most potent offense in the American League (Detroit) coming into Camden Yards this weekend, the Oriole bullpen needed some \xe2\x80\x9cpre-emptive rest\xe2\x80\x9d last night. In going eight innings, Garcia provided that for the \xe2\x80\x98pen. With the exception of Jim Johnson (who\xe2\x80\x99s now successfully worked on consecutive nights), everyone in the bullpen has at least one full day\xe2\x80\x99s rest. In the final inning and a half or so of his outing, it was easy to see that Garcia was starting to tire. His fastball started to locate up, however he was successfully able to get his supplemental pitches across for strikes. That shows a pitcher that\xe2\x80\x99s really on his game in the sense that he was inducing outs with his offspeed stuff once his fastball command was starting to fade. Johnson once again sent Washington down 1-2-3 in the ninth for the save, sending the hometown crowd home happy.For the second consecutive season, the Orioles have won the \xe2\x80\x9cBattle of the Beltways,\xe2\x80\x9d this year taking three of four as opposed to four of six. They swept the Baltimore games for the second time in the history of the series, the first time being 2010. So is this really a feather in the cap of Baltimore fans? I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about that necessarily, however I suppose that local bragging rights vouch for something. Winning a series against Detroit this weekend would probably mean much more to the Orioles in the grand scheme of things, just I\xe2\x80\x99m sure as winning a series against Atlanta would probably mean more to Washington. One thing I will say is that if the mid-Atlantic region is any indication, baseball won\xe2\x80\x99t be ceasing the \xe2\x80\x9cregional rivalries\xe2\x80\x9d anytime soon. As much complaining as we hear about the unbalanced schedule and so forth, from an attendance perspective both Baltimore and Washington fans seem to really enjoy these games.As I said above the Orioles will face Detroit in a three-game set at the yard this weekend starting tonight. Miguel Gonzalez will get the start for the Orioles, fresh off of a great start last Saturday in Toronto in which he ended up being non-decisioned after Jim Johnson blew a save. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Max Scherzer, who will attempt to go 9-0 on the season. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
06/01/2013,"[('Orioles 3, Tigers 10: A big old mess - Camden Chat', ' Going into today, this was not a game that many Orioles fans expected to turn out as a win. That\'s just the attitude one has when his or her team is facing Justin Verlander. So on one hand, you could say that at least if the Orioles were going to give up 10 runs, they might as well do it in a game when they are facing a pitcher like Verlander. Save the good pitching for a chance they have to win.  Well, Verlander was good today, but he wasn\'t as dominant as the Orioles have sometimes seen him. He pitched seven innings and gave up eight hits and one walk, but only allowed three runs. Two of those runs were on solo homers by J.J. Hardy and the third was on an RBI single by Chris Davis that knocked in Manny Machado.  From the get go today, Jason Hammel didn\'t look too sharp. He had a walk in the first inning and gave up a run in the second. He was lucky it was only one as he walked two in the inning but benefited from a sweet double play started by second baseman Ryan Flaherty. He had a very nice 1-2-3 third inning that made me think he might be settling down, but well, that was not the case at all.  In the fourth inning, things went bad very, very quickly. In the span of just a few minutes, Hammel gave up three home runs, hit a guy in the head, and was tossed from the game without any hesitation from the home plate umpire. Here is the play-by-play for the first four batters:     Top 4th: Detroit    - V. Martinez homered to deep right   - J. Peralta homered to deep left   - A. Avila homered to deep center   - M. Tuiasosopo hit by pitch    - T.J. McFarland relieved J. Hammel       The pitch that hit Matt Tuiasosopo was a looping breaking ball, and the second it hit him the umpire ejected Hammel. It seemed clear to me that Hammel didn\'t throw at him on purpose. He had been missing his spots all night and even if he were going to throw at a batter (which doesn\'t seem to be Hammel\'s style at all) I am certain he would never go head hunting. Hammel\'s reaction upon being ejected was one of complete disbelief. He jumped up in the air out of frustration and then began talking intensely to the ump. Before things could get too out of hand, Buck Showalter came out to take his place. Hammel left the field as the crowd booed the umpire and maybe Hammel just a little, since he was pretty terrible today.     T.J. McFarland relieved Hammel and the poor guy didn\'t fare any better than Hammel did. Here is the play-by-play for the next four batters:   - A. Garcia singled to shallow right, M. Tuiasosopo to second   - O. Infante doubled to left, M. Tuiasosopo scored, A. Garcia to third   - A. Dirks walked    - M. Cabrera homered to deep left, A. Garcia, O. Infante and A. Dirks scored    When McFarland got three balls on Andy Dirks I said out loud, ""Do not walk Dirks so that Cabrera can hit a grand slam..."" He didn\'t listen to me. He did retire the next three batters to end the inning, but it\'s safe to say that the damage was done. Just to give the Tigers a nice round number, McFarland also gave up a home run to Prince Fielder in the sixth inning.  Verlander exited the game with a 10-3 lead and the Orioles were not able to mount any rallies against his replacement, Drew Smyly. I suppose if you\'re looking for a silver lining, Troy Patton pitched pretty well. He had a great first inning of work, getting two ground outs and a strike out. He gave up two singles to start his second inning, but got the next three to retire the side. Tommy Hunter pitched a perfect ninth inning in the loss.  Tomorrow is the third day of Gausmas. Cross your fingers we don\'t get any more lumps of coal.   ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Around the minors - 5/31/13 - Camden Chat, a Baltimore ...', "" Norfolk Tides 3, Buffalo Bisons 6 The rehabbing Tsuyoshi Wada was on the mound for the Tides tonight and he did not have much success. In just 4 2/3 innings he gave up 8 hits and 2 walks, leading to 6 runs (4 earned). He did not strike out a batter and a ground out to fly out ratio of 6:8. Mike Belfiore and Adam Russell pitched well in relief.  The Tides hitters scored 2 runs in 5 2/3 innings against Bisons starter Dave Bush. Buck Britton homered for one of the runs and the other came in on a Russ Canzler single to knock in Jason Pridie, who had walked. The Tides added a third run in the ninth inning thanks to a home run by Brandon Wood. He homered off of a guy named Josh Stilson, and for a moment I thought the Orioles traded Josh Stinson before the games started.  Wood went 2-for-4 on the day. The only other Tide with more than one hit was Zealous Wheeler, who singled twice. Recently demoted Yamaico Navarro was 0-for-3 with a walk. Taylor Teagarden started behind the plate for the Tides and went 1-for-4. I assume we'll see him back with Baltimore soon.  The Tides play at home tonight at 7:05 with the not-traded Josh Stinson on the mound.     Bowie Baysox 7, New Britain Rock Cats 6 (11) The Baysox blew a two-run lead in the bottom of the ninth to send the game to extra innings before finally winning in the 11th on a Niuman Romero RBI double.     The Baysox put up four runs in the second inning thanks to doubles by Aaron Baker, Steve Bumbry, and Luis Martinez, along with a single by Ty Kelly and a walk to Bryan Ward.  Mike Wright started for the Baysox and pitched 5 innings giving up 4 runs (0 earned...thanks, Bowie defense) while striking out 5 and walking 0. Wright got the first two outs in the third before hitting a batter, then an error by Aaron Baker kept the inning alive (and made all subsequent runs unearned). Wright then gave up a two-run double and a two-run home run. Other than the 4th inning, Wright had a successful night.     The Baysox scored two more in the 7th inning to go ahead on a two-run home run by Brandon Waring. But Jason Gurka gave those two runs right back in the 9th. Gurka blew the lead by giving up a single and then two doubles. He came back in the 10th and gave up a single and walk but didn't give up any runs.  Ward drew his second walk of the night in the 11th inning and after a sac bunt by Ty Kelly, came in to score on a double by Romero. Zech Zinicola pitched a scoreless bottom of the inning (1 walk) to get the save.  Ty Kelly had three hits on the night, including a triple. Niuman Romero also had three hits (two doubles). In addition to his homer, Brandon Waring drew two walks, and Henry Urrutia had two singles.  Zach Clark and his 9.65 ERA will be on the mound for the Baysox tonight.  Frederick Keys 2, Wilmington Blue Rocks 1 Eduardo Rodriguez was on the mound for the Keys tonight and was very good. He pitched 6 1/3 innings and gave up 1 run on 5 hits, all singles. He walked 3 and struck out 3. I know PBR me ASAP! was at the game so hopefully he'll have some insight for us on how Rodriguez looked in person.  The Keys scored solo runs in each of the first two innings. In the first, back-to-back singles by Jerome Pena and Sammie Starr set up an RBI ground out, and in the second Travis Adair was hit by a pitch, stole second, and scored on a single by Starr.  Gene Escat and Zach Fowler followed Rodriguez in relief and each gave up just one single.  Sammie Starr had three hits on the night and Christian Walker was 2-for-4 with a double. Michael Ohlman had a single and a walk.  The Keys and Blue Rocks are back in action tonight with Tyler Wilson pitching for the Keys.  Delmarva Shorebirds 7, Greensboro Grasshoppers 6 (10) Adrian Marin scored on a wild pitch in the 8th inning to send the game to extras and after the Grasshoppers scored a run in the top of the 10th, the Shorebirds came back with two in the bottom of the inning to get the win. Josh Hader started for the Shorebirds and pitched 5 innings. He gave up 2 runs on 5 hits, but continues to walk a lot of batters. He had 4 walks to just 2 strikeouts. He's currently giving up walks at a rate of about 4.75 per nine.  Matt Hobgood's dominance did not continue tonight as he also walked 4 batters, although it took him just 2 innings to do so. He gave up 3 runs (1 earned) and struck out 1.  Lex Rutledge pitched the final three innings for the Shorebirds and gave up 1 run in the top of the 10th on just 1 hit and 2 walks. The Shorebirds walked a total of 10 in the game. Ouch.  The top of the lineup did a lot of damage for the Birds, with Lucas Herbst, Roderick Bernadina, Tucker Nathans, and Nik Balog each having multi-hit games. Balog had two doubles on the night. Adrian Marin added three hits including a double from the 8 spot in the lineup.  The Shorebirds play at home tonight, starting pitchers is TBD.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

I felt like today was probably the most polished and calm I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out there since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been up here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gausman, the fourth overall pick in last year\xe2\x80\x99s draft. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it had something to do with [pitching at home] or if I was just comfortable with my mechanics and all that.\xe2\x80\x9dAfter allowing 11 runs in two losses against the Toronto Blue Jays and Washington Nationals, Gausman said he knew he needed to make changes. He worked on refining his changeup and on tweaking his mechanics so that he was pitching more on a downward plane.It worked. Twelve of the 18 outs he recorded came via ground balls. He also struck out four \xe2\x80\x93 and none more impressive than his last one to end his outing. Reigning American League MVP Miguel Cabrera struck out looking at a 97-mph fastball that hit the outside corner.\xe2\x80\x9cHe\'s the best hitter in the game. I just tried to make my pitches and keep everything down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gausman, who also got Cabrera to hit into two double plays. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\'s a great contact hitter too, so for him to watch that pitch, I was kind of surprised. He kept fouling off pitches. It was a good battle. It was fun.\xe2\x80\x9dFor the first six innings, things weren\xe2\x80\x99t particularly carefree for the Orioles (32-25), who had been shut down by Detroit right-hander Rick Porcello.Then Orioles first baseman Chris Davis did what he has been doing all season \xe2\x80\x93 hitting the long ball and providing a spark with a solo homer to right.\xe2\x80\x9cI thought Chris Davis was the first guy to throw out the \xe2\x80\x98get-back-in-it\xe2\x80\x99 mode,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orioles manager Buck Showalter.It was Davis\xe2\x80\x99 major league-leading 20th home run and it cut the Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 lead to 2-1. Davis, who hit 33 last season, smacked his 20th home run on Aug. 19 last year. He\xe2\x80\x99s on pace for 57 this season, which would shatter Brady Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s team record of 50 in 1996.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s obviously good to get off to a good start,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut at the same time you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep plugging day-in and day-out, and the numbers will be there at the end of the season.\xe2\x80\x9dTrailing by one, the Orioles then chased Porcello with consecutive singles by Dickerson and J.J. Hardy in the seventh. Pinch-hitter Danny Valencia tied the game with a soft liner to shallow right center against Tigers reliever Phil Coke.\xe2\x80\x9cIn this game, you are going to hit some balls hard that are going to be caught. It can be frustrating,\xe2\x80\x9d Valencia said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then you get hits like that, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t really barrel up that find holes. It\xe2\x80\x99s definitely nice to get those hits. They always say they come back, so hopefully they keep coming back.\xe2\x80\x9dIt was just the second pinch hit in 19 at-bats for the Orioles this season. Nate McLouth had a one-out, broken bat single to center that scored pinch-runner Alexi Casilla from second to give the Orioles a three-run inning and their first lead. Casilla had an RBI double in the eighth on a ball hit over the head of Tigers left fielder Andy Dirks to make it 4-2.Relievers Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Jim Johnson (18th save) made sure the leads held up. Brian Matusz (2-0), who allowed one run on a Jhonny Peralta RBI single in the seventh, was credited with the win.But the day\xe2\x80\x99s memorable pitching performance was delivered by another Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first-rounder in Gausman, who finally showed consistency to go with his tremendous arsenal.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s a pretty tough road to start out with, starting out in Toronto and you head to Washington,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe perfect situation doesn\'t always match up. I\'m real proud of him. I know it meant a lot to him.\xe2\x80\x9dThe guys on the other side were fairly impressed, too.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

06/03/2013,"[('Orioles Day Off: Glancing Around the League - Birds \\u2026', 'Orioles manager Buck Showalter often says he does not worry about what other teams around the league are doing, nor does he pay much attention to the standings, particularly early in the season. I believe him; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he is just saying that for the media. His point is that there is nothing he can do about it, and he has plenty else to focus upon that will impact where the Orioles ultimately place in the standings. The goal needs to be winning the most games possible by focusing on the task at hand today, and then getting ready for the next contest.I find myself doing the same \xe2\x80\x93 just watching the Orioles without a great deal of interest on a daily basis about what is going on around the American League, and even less about that other circuit. But with an off day, I did take a closer look at the standings around baseball, along with a look at team statistics in each league. It is an interesting study.May 30, 2013; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles teammates Jim Johnson (43) and Nate McLouth (9) celebrate after a game against the Washington Nationals at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles defeated the Nationals 2-0. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe AL East standings have the Red Sox with a 2.5-game lead over the Orioles and 3.0 over the Yankees and Rays. We all knew it was going to be a season-long dogfight in the division, so seeing teams packed together is not a surprise. But that the Blue Jays are 10.5 games behind and in the dark recesses of the basement is a surprise. Having seen them play recently, I still believe they are going to be heard from and will be a team of impact upon who eventually does prevail. And many people predicted the demise of the Yankees. So their early season success in spite of the many injured players was unexpected \xe2\x80\x93 though they have now gone 3-7 over the past 10 games, whereas the Orioles have been 7-3 (along with the Red Sox and Rays). Is this the reality of their situation setting in? And along that same line, can the Sox really continue at this pace?It is not a shocker that the Texas Rangers have the best overall record in the American League at 35-21, though that is a mere .600 winning percentage.\xc2\xa0 Of note in that Western Division is that those pesky Oakland Athletics have won 9 of the past 10 games. As with the popularity of certain pop musicians, I cannot explain it, I can only report that it is true.The top team in baseball in terms of won-loss percentage is St. Louis with a record of 37-19. Really? That is stellar. So how are they doing it? A glance at their roster does not reveal a plethora of well-known baseball names, but a glance at league stats gives a quick explanation. They are by far the leader in pitching with a team ERA of 2.99 (compare that with the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 4.50), and they are 3rd in hitting with a .267 team average. It is not the long ball that carries them however, as they rank 13th in the NL in that category. It is simply a nicely balanced team \xe2\x80\x93 the sort of thing the Orioles are seeking to build as well.Back to the AL and the Orioles: Clearly it is the offense that has carried the Orioles this season. If this can continue along with the pitching finding some anticipated improvement, it could yet end up as a terrific season for the Birds. The Orioles currently trail only the Tigers in terms of team batting (.279 to .275), while the Orioles lead not just the league, but all of MLB in homers (81) and slugging. It is also gratifying to see the Orioles trail only the Rockies in stolen bases and the Cardinals in team defense. (Warning: there is a big BUT coming!)\xc2\xa0 BUT, the pitching ranks 13th in the AL and 27th in all of MLB with that 4.50 ERA.\xc2\xa0 And the 78 home runs allowed in the second highest of all 30 teams.BUT, here\xe2\x80\x99s the good news in the long term \xe2\x80\x93 we know that these numbers are skewed by some blow-out situations and that they will not continue this way. (We do know that, right?)\xc2\xa0 And in the short term, the next three games are against the pitching staff that ranks 30th in almost every category.So, time to re-focus on the task at hand. It would be sweet to sweep the Astros and get two of three from the Rays on this week\xe2\x80\x99s six-game road trip. That would make the Orioles 37-26, on pace to win 95 games\xe2\x80\x94that should work!

The Orioles have given up just one fewer, leading the American League with 78 allowed.This weekend didn\'t help matters, of course.

Going into his home debut yesterday in the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 series finale against Detroit, Gausman knew he\xe2\x80\x99d have to pitch a whale of a ballgame in order to beat the potent lineup set forth by Jim Leyland. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that whatever Gausman did in those side sessions must have worked, as he pitched his rear end off. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 5 H, 1 R, 0 BB, 4 K. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s one run surrendered came on a fourth inning solo home run by Prince Fielder which broke a scoreless tie.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsGausman showed how good he was at \xe2\x80\x9cpitching\xe2\x80\x9d in the fifth inning when Jhonny Peralta led off the game with a single, and advanced to second on a wild pitch. Following a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice Peralta was at third base with one out, but Gausman induced two ground outs to end the inning. Unfortunately for Gausman, the O\xe2\x80\x99s weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to put a run across while he was still in the game, as his counterpart Rick Porcello was equally as good. As I said previously, Porcello was a pitcher that Detroit had earmarked for the Orioles when they had their eyes on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s glove. Porcello showed yesterday that he had talent and that perhaps he could have helped the Orioles; but by turning down that trade (on numerous occasions), I think the Birds got the better deal.Brian Matusz came out of the bullpen to relieve Gausman, and allowed Detroit to put another run across in the top of the seventh. However Chris Davis extended his major league lead in homers with a solo shot onto Eutaw Street to lead off the seventh, which cut Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s lead to 2-1. That was Davis\xe2\x80\x99 20th homer on the year, which as I said leads the majors. That homer was followed up by Chris Dickerson and J.J. Hardy singles, as it became obvious that Porcello was beginning to tire. Detroit brought in Phil Coke in relief with runners at the corners and nobody out, and Buck Showalter sent Danny Valencia up in Ryan Flaherty\xe2\x80\x98s spot. Valencia singled to right, scoring Dickerson and tying the game. Later in the inning Nate McLouth\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single scored Alexi Casilla (who pinch-ran for Valencia), and the O\xe2\x80\x99s had their first lead of the day at 3-2. In the eighth inning Casilla would double home Chris Davis to give the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 4-2 lead. Jim Johnson would allow a hit in the ninth, but he would ultimately close down the most potent lineup in the American League as the Orioles took the game 4-3.Last season the Birds dropped two-of-three to Detroit at Camden Yards, and they bounced back this year and took two-of-three. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re keeping score at home, that\xe2\x80\x99s a net gain of one game. As I said above, whatever Kevin Gausman did during those side sessions really seemed to work for him. In his previous starts in Toronto and Washington he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have too much pizzazz on his fastball, however he was inducing late movement on his pitches yesterday. Even the home run pitch to Prince Fielder wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a bad pitch; it was low in the strike zone, but Fielder went down and clubbed it over the fence. As great as he pitched, you wish that the Birds could have taken the lead with him still in the game, however that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t meant to be. For the record, the same could be said of Rick Porcello, who was probably left in the game for two outs too many. MASN cameras caught Porcello in the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 dugout seeming to sulk about the end of his outing given how good he was for 95% of it. That\xe2\x80\x99s another reason that Orioles fans should be glad the trade was never made.The Orioles will have a day off today before they head to Houston to open up a three-game series tomorrow night. This will be the first time that the two teams have met as American League foes with Houston switching leagues for this season. Former Orioles skipper Dave Trembley is also Houston\xe2\x80\x99s third base coach, which adds an interesting dynamic to the series. As I said at the beginning of the weekend, the Orioles were going to need to use their bullpen a lot in the Detroit series, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a good thing that they get today off.

He was 72.The cause was cardiac arrest, his family said.Mr. Phillips \xe2\x80\x94 who at 6 feet 2 inches and 280 pounds was called Bear by friend and foe \xe2\x80\x94 got his start at 13 by organizing a walkout of altar boys at his church to protest a new priest\xe2\x80\x99s decision to reduce their tips for wedding ceremonies. The priest relented. Mr. Phillips once threw a chair through a window in a negotiating session for umpires.Before being retained by the umpires as general counsel and executive director of the Major League Umpires Association, Mr. Phillips helped National Basketball Association referees triple their earnings in the 1970s. During his time with the umpires, from 1978 to 1999, he got them raises, to $282,500 from $40,000 for the experienced ones and to $95,000 from $17,500 for the rookies. But both unions ended up firing him. The basketball referees had decided he was overpaid. The story with the umpires was more complicated.Their contract forbade strikes, but they feared that Major League Baseball was planning to fire them Dec. 31, 1999, when the contract expired. Mr. Phillips hit on the idea of having all the umpires resign on Sept. 2, 1999. He thought this would make them eligible for $15 million in severance pay and put pressure on baseball to make concessions. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      It turned out to be a monumental miscalculation. Some umpires refused to sign resignation letters, although more than 50 of the union\xe2\x80\x99s 66 members did. Major League Baseball stunned the umpires by accepting all the resignations, then picked the ones it wanted to hire back. Umpiring vacancies were filled with minor league umpires.

Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s opponents persuaded the National Labor Relations Board to hold a vote to decertify the Major League Umpires Association.

Umpires\xe2\x80\x99 nerves had become particularly ragged after Roberto Alomar, a Baltimore Orioles star, spit in an umpire\xe2\x80\x99s face in 1996 and was suspended for only five games.

He worked as a public defender, and then in the Philadelphia district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office, where he became the chief of organized crime and homicide.A football player in college, he became involved in the sports business by representing his friend Howard Porter, a former Villanova basketball star, in his negotiations with the Chicago Bulls in 1971. He won Porter a $1.25 million contract, large at the time, by threatening to take his client to the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s rival league, the American Basketball Association. The Chicago Tribune said Mr. Phillips made his critical point by reaching into a bag, pulling out the A.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s official red, white and blue basketball and plunking it on the table.In 1976, he helped organize the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s referees and forced the league to recognize them as a collective bargaining unit. A year later, during the playoffs, he called a strike that led to pay hikes and better working conditions.

', 'www.nytimes.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Justice vs. Legality - Birds Watcher', 'I majored in broadcasting while in college because I wanted to be a major market disc jockey. I also minored in American Government, and a part of that minor were some courses in what amounted to pre-law. So while bearing in mind that I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer nor in the legal profession, however I\xe2\x80\x99m going to put on my law cap for just a moment. According to an ESPN report that was released this evening, approximately 20 players could be suspended in the coming weeks as a result of being named in a report in conjunction with Tony Bosch\xe2\x80\x99s Biogenesis Clinic that was giving out PED\xe2\x80\x99s. Many of these players (such as Alex Rodriguez, Melky Cabrera, and Ryan Braun) could be facing very large suspensions of at least 100 games.With that said, let me state unequivocally that I\xe2\x80\x99m in favor of MLB doing something to rid itself of steroids and PED\xe2\x80\x99s. I have no doubt that this is still a very prevalent problem league-wide, and furthermore I suspect that many of the guilty players are guys that would probably surprise us. (Having said that, I do believe in the concept of innocent until proven guilty.) However with that said, I do think that this is a very slippery legal slope for baseball to try to navigate. When we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about handing down the types of suspensions that they\xe2\x80\x99re allegedly discussing, the entity (in this case MLB) had better make sure that their T\xe2\x80\x99s are crossed and their I\xe2\x80\x99s dotted.According to the article (which is linked above):\xe2\x80\x9cOne source familiar with the case said the commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s office might seek 100-game suspensions for Rodriguez, Braun and other players, the penalty for a second doping offense. The argument, the source said, is the players\xe2\x80\x99 connection to Bosch constitutes one offense, and previous statements to MLB officials denying any such connection or the use of PEDs constitute another. Bosch and his attorneys did not return several calls. MLB officials refused to comment when reached Tuesday.\xe2\x80\x9dIn my opinion this could be considered a bit of a reach by baseball. If you read further into the article, it says the following:\xe2\x80\x9cMLB already has established precedent to suspend a player for two offenses in one shot: Minor league player Cesar Carrillo was hit with a 100-game suspension in March when he was confronted with Biogenesis documents containing his name and then denied having any connection to Bosch or the clinic.\xc2\xa0Because Carrillo was on a minor league contract, however, and thus not a member of the MLB Players\xe2\x80\x99 Association, he was not entitled to an appeal through arbitration. Major League players accused by MLB are expected to fight any suspension, and efforts to charge the players with multiple offenses would bring that fight to another level. In the appeals process, players are allowed to confront witnesses and evidence in a courtroom-like procedure before an arbitration panel.\xe2\x80\x9dCourtesy of Andrew Weber-USA TODAY SportsAgain, I\xe2\x80\x99m coming at this from more of a legal standpoint than a baseball one. Withstanding appeals by the players union and so forth, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a huge number of games and thus a huge amount of money that these guys will be docked. Does one not think that they might not consider legal action to reclaim that money, especially given that the only precedent which exists is from a guy that had no union representation?On a personal level and as a baseball writer, I fully support MLB\xe2\x80\x99s intention of suspending anyone involved in this situation and with PED\xe2\x80\x99s in general. I\xe2\x80\x99m on record as saying that the rule should be that you\xe2\x80\x99re suspended for 365 calendar days on your first offense, and banned for life on your second. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the WWF of the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s; PED use in baseball is inexcusable. However my concern is that baseball isn\xe2\x80\x99t considering the potential pitfalls of that course of action.You might ask why it would be an issue for MLB and all of it\xe2\x80\x99s teams (including the Baltimore Orioles) if some cases ended up in court. Do they really need the PR hit that could endure from going to court in a very public manner over steroids? My personal opinion is that many (if not all) of these guys are in fact guilty. However if I was guilty of using PED\xe2\x80\x99s and I was told that I was getting suspended as a second-time offender because I had given a sworn statement saying I had never used, I might consider a legal challenge. (Whether that person was guilty of perjury might be a different story.) Again, does baseball really want to have to go to court on an issue that is already as public of a black mark on a sport as you can get?In fact, a court of law could rule that there\xe2\x80\x99s legal precedent for baseball improperly handling some of these cases. An independent arbitrator ruled that \xc2\xa0the league\xe2\x80\x99s courier had mishandled Ryan Braun\xe2\x80\x99s sample the last time around, and thus his suspension was lifted and expunged. I suppose that what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that as much as I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the players involved be brought to justice by baseball, I have to wonder if they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be cutting off their noses to spite their faces. I would tend to believe that most of those guys are guilty; I just question the methodology that MLB appears to be using to bring them to justice. Sometimes what\xe2\x80\x99s truly \xe2\x80\x9cright,\xe2\x80\x9d might not be \xe2\x80\x9clegal.\xe2\x80\x9d ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

A pair of early 20-something Orioles fans were drinking beer \xe2\x80\x93 by all evidences a bit too much. Taunting the fellow with the Yankees hat, it escalated into a thrown beer by the young guys.

After all, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a team named the \xe2\x80\x9cHot Dogs\xe2\x80\x9d (though we have some players who qualify), the \xe2\x80\x9cApple Pies,\xe2\x80\x9d or the \xe2\x80\x9cChevys.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But we do have a team called the \xe2\x80\x9cBrewers,\xe2\x80\x9d and there is a Busch Stadium; and that is merely the suds on top of the connection of alcohol as an industry associated with the sport of baseball.Maybe you feel an anti-alcohol sentiment rising, and perhaps a sermon in the wings. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll confess to the former conviction and note that I get paid in the primary profession of my life to deliver the latter. But I realize my audience to hear such a message is very small. The response will be that the actions of a few should not reflect upon the responsibility of the masses. And that is true, just as the actions of a couple of bozo Orioles fans do not reflect upon the generally high-caliber behavior of Oriole Nation.But the irresponsible antics of drunks at ballgames has been witnessed by us all; it is sadly not rare and it can be totally ridiculous. In fact, my aversion to even the smell of alcohol goes back to my very, very early years (about age 9?) at a Phillies game (I know \xe2\x80\x93 you\xe2\x80\x99ll say THAT was the problem!) where I went out to get a hot dog, and a drunk old man thought it would be great fun to throw the rest of his beer on the front of my sweatshirt. I was totally grossed out, and can\xe2\x80\x99t get the stuff past my nose, let alone down my throat!But regarding the original story here and regarding how I have also seen it reported elsewhere, the question has been raised \xe2\x80\x93 even as the Orioles get better on the field and more people are returning to the stadium \xe2\x80\x93 is rowdy drinking behavior becoming a common problem? One site ran it as an online question, and about 40% of respondents answered that \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d it is increasing.Though I will never personally understand it, I know that beer and baseball are going to be connected. And though it may not sound like it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t begrudge people of that enjoyment. But we all know there is a line beyond which responsible behavior becomes irresponsible \xe2\x80\x93 and though sometimes drunks just make a humorously silly fool of themselves, there are incidents where it may sadly become dangerous to themselves or others.Every report of local friends with the victim is that he did not incite the actions in any way. If he is culpable of anything, it may be that he did not involve the ushers and security staff at OPACY in dealing with the matter (I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he did or not). That would be the rightful thing to do.So is the atmosphere deteriorating? In my years of trips to Oriole Park, I can only remember one occasion where the fans were beyond appropriate. It was an extraordinarily long extra-innings game against the Phillies about 5-6 years ago \xe2\x80\xa6 probably contributing to the time folks (both sides) had to thrown down their libations.

If you look at both, you probably find yourself living a baseball fan life full of turmoil. Welcome to my world. No one on the Orioles has ever faced Houston\'s starter, Dallas Keuchel. Whether a man by that name even exists is an open question. This supposed pitcher is left-handed. I saw your reflexive shudder. The Orioles are 8-7 against lefty starters this season.

06/06/2013,"[('Who Are The Top 10 Draft Picks in Baltimore Orioles ...', "" With the 2013 edition of the Major League Baseball Rule 4 (amateur) Draft set for Thursday night, it's a good chance to step back and take a look at some of the most successful picks in franchise history. If all goes well, what could they get out of the draft? Some high-profile, high-pick failures in recent years have been discouraging. This year, selecting later in the first round, the Orioles will not get their pick of the cream of the crop, but the franchise has gotten some of its greatest players late in the first round and beyond. The amateur draft first took place in 1965, which means that Hall of Fame greats like Jim Palmer and Brooks Robinson are not eligible to be included: both signed as amateur free agents before there was any such thing as a draft. In terms of value to the franchise as measured by the Baseball Reference Wins Above Replacement (WAR) statistic, these are the top ten Orioles ever drafted:   10. Rich Dauer   1974 Round: 1 Overall pick: 24     O's Years G PA BA OBP SLG OPS+ bWAR   10 1140 4218 .257 .310 .343 83 14.4      Dauer made his debut in 1976 after being drafted from the University of Southern California and played the entirety of a ten-year MLB career in Baltimore. He was about as valuable with his glove as he was offensively, which is why he is included on the list despite actually being a below-average offensive player for his era. He played mostly second base for the team, the definition of a light-hitting middle infielder. He was a part of the 1983 World Series-winning O's team.    It is striking that in nearly 50 years of drafts, the 10th-best player for the Orioles has been Dauer. There were nine guys better than him, but not ten. It is hard, and always has been hard, to draft a player who is good and who will stay with the organization for a lot of good years.   9. Mike Boddicker   1978 Round: 6 Overall pick: 152     O's Years G IP W L ERA ERA+ bWAR   9 190 1273.2 79 73 3.73 109 17.5      Boddicker played the first nine years of a 14-year MLB career for the Orioles. He was drafted out of the University of Iowa. Of his 190 games, 180 were starts,  and he amassed all those innings as a slightly-above league average pitcher in his time with the O's. His career as an Oriole spanned from 1980 through 1988, when, before the trade deadline of that disastrous season, he was sent to Boston in a trade that netted Brady Anderson and Curt Schilling. If Brady was an Orioles draft pick, he would rank 5th on this list. So Boddicker contributed, in a way, even after being traded. Boddicker came in third place in Rookie of the Year voting in 1983 and was part of that World Series winning team as well. He came in fourth in Cy Young voting in 1984, when he put up a 20-11 record with a 2.79 ERA in 261.1 IP. He was also selected to the All-Star team that year.   8. Mike Flanagan   1973 Round: 7 Overall pick: 159     O's Years G IP W L ERA ERA+ bWAR   15 450 2317.2 141 116 3.89 100 21.8   The late Mike Flanagan was known only to me as a failed general manager and a great broadcaster, but the 1979 Cy Young Award winner was, before my time, one of the greatest players in franchise history. He is still third on the franchise leaderboard for innings pitched and fourth in strikeouts with 1297. His career as an Oriole ran from 1975-1987, when he was traded to Toronto in a trade that included Jose Mesa as a player to be named later. Flanagan came back to the Orioles in 1991 and 1992. He was in the bullpen in 1991 and pitched well, but '92 was one year too many for the then-40-year old. At his peak, he was the best pitcher in the American League, he was a part of two Orioles teams that made it to the World Series, including two heroic efforts in the 1979 World Series, and his steady performance over such a long stretch of time easily sets him up as one of the greatest draft picks in franchise history.  7. Nick Markakis  2003 Round: 1 Overall pick: 7     O's Years G PA BA OBP SLG OPS+ bWAR   8 1108 4819 .296 .364 .454 117 24.4   Markakis is the first of two still-active Orioles to make an appearance on this list of draft picks. I was surprised to see him so high, because he is a player who is frustrating at times. Why did his nearly .300/.400/.500 season in 2008 at age 24 never translate into similar success in his prime? Why does he now, at age 29, seem to lack arm strength and speed? I still don't know the answer to these questions, but even with those being the case, he has, in his 8-year career, been one of the best Orioles picks of all time. It's sometimes hard to appreciate a good-but-not-great player when you watch them every day. Their flaws are amplified under a microscope. Much as we dump on the Orioles for missing big with high picks, Markakis is currently the leader in WAR among all players selected in the first round of the 2003 draft. There are six teams who drafted ahead of the Orioles that year who wish they would have taken Markakis. Never the star we hoped for, he is still the best player to be selected in his draft class.   6. Al Bumbry   1968 Round: 11 Overall pick: 238     O's Years G PA BA OBP SLG OPS+ bWAR   13 1428 5516 .283 .345 .380 105 24.7   Bumbry won the 1973 Rookie of the Year Award as a 26-year old. He had lost a year of development as a prospect because he served in the Army in Vietnam, where he led a platoon and was awarded a Bronze Star. I wonder if we will ever see a veteran in MLB again. He was an Oriole from 1972-1984, during which time he stole 254 bases, including two seasons where he stole 40+. He is the latest-round pick to make the top ten in franchise history. Never a great fielder by the bWAR metric, he was capable enough to stay out there and play for a long time. Like many of these other great draft picks, he played in multiple World Series' for the team, winning it all in 1983.  5. Brian Roberts 1999 Round: 1 (supplemental) Overall pick: 50    O's Years G PA BA OBP SLG OPS+ bWAR   13 1253 5621 .280 .351 .413 102 28.4   For better or worse, Roberts, a product of the University of North Carolina, is the best of the 00s for the Orioles. Though he's played only 118 games in the past four seasons combined, what he did before that is still enough to place him this high on the list. In his best years, he provided above-average offensive production among all hitters in the league, while holding down the premium position of second base. What might we say about him if he was never derailed by concussions and other injuries? He is already an all-time great Oriole, and one of the great unfortunate things about the surprising 2012 is that neither he nor Markakis, both long-toiling on bad teams, did not get to play in any of the playoff games. A two-time All-Star, he garnered some down-ballot MVP support in his career year in 2005, when he OPSed over .900.   4. Bobby Grich  1967 Round: 1 Overall pick: 19    O's Years G PA BA OBP SLG OPS+ bWAR   7 786 3344 .262 .372 .405 127 36.0   The Orioles took Grich out of Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, California. He was so good in his seven years as an Oriole that he is fourth on this list despite playing the fewest years for the team out of anyone on the top ten. Though he played seven years in total, he only spent the whole year on the team in five of those years. He won four Gold Gloves and was selected to three All-Star teams. Like several of the other great Orioles picks on this list, he was a second baseman who could hit. Grich is the first real notable departure from the Orioles in free agency among the players on this list. He played for the O's from 1970-1976, after which he went to play in California, his home state, for the remainder of a 17-year career. His career numbers compare favorably to second basemen in the Baseball Hall of Fame, though he never made it past one year on the ballot.  3. Mike Mussina 1990 Round: 1 Overall pick: 20    O's Years G IP W L ERA ERA+ bWAR   10 288 2009.2 147 81 3.53 130 47.6   I am old enough that I saw Mussina pitch as an Oriole many times. I was old enough when he left for New York to be angry about it. I was not old enough to appreciate, at the time, just how good he was for my favorite baseball team. As an Oriole, he was selected to five All-Star teams, finished in the top five of Cy Young voting five times, and won four Gold Gloves. He had 45 complete games and fifteen shutouts. His 1535 strikeouts rank second in franchise history behind only Palmer, and he is the third-most winning pitcher in franchise history behind Palmer and Dave McNally. He was one of the best pitchers of the 1990s, and in the 90s, we had him all to ourselves. In the 1997 playoffs, Mussina started four games, threw 29 innings, struck out 41 batters and only allowed 18 baserunners. The only reason they did not win every game he started - and make it to the World Series - is Armando Benitez. If there is justice in the baseball universe, he will be elected to the Hall of Fame, and he'll be enshrined as an Oriole.   2. Eddie Murray  1973 Round: 3 Overall pick: 63    O's Years G PA BA OBP SLG OPS+ bWAR   13 1884 8053 .294 .370 .498 139 56.4   From 1977, when he won the Rookie of the Year Award at the age of 21, on until 1986, Eddie was selected to seven All-Star teams and finished in the top five of the MVP voting in five straight years. For someone like me, who has mostly only seen terrible Orioles teams, I almost can't even process what it must have been like to have a superstar player like Murray do what he did for so long. He's the fifth on this list to be a part of the 1983 World Series championship team. Murray hit two home runs in the series. To this day, I hear grumbling from my dad about writers running Murray out of town. I didn't experience all that first hand, but if that's really what happened, shame on those men. Murray is one of the best to ever play baseball, and Orioles fans are lucky to get to claim him as ours.  1. Cal Ripken Jr. 1978 Round: 2 Overall pick: 48    O's Years G PA BA OBP SLG OPS+ bWAR   21 3001 12883 .276 .340 .447 112 95.6   Just look at this. Damn. ** The Orioles will almost certainly not find a player as great as Ripken or Murray or Mussina with the 22nd pick, the 37th pick, or the 61st pick on Thursday night. The likes of those players are seldom drafted across all of Major League Baseball, let alone by one team. But, with good scouting, good player development, a healthy amount of luck, and the purse-strings loosened at just the right time, they just might find a player as good as Dauer, or Bumbry, or Roberts. The next great Oriole could well begin his journey tonight.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Last week the Baltimore Orioles came from behind to out-slug Washington 9-6, followed by a 2-0 win in a pitchers duel the next night. On Wednesday the Orioles were out-slugged in Houston 11-7, only to come back yesterday afternoon to win another pitchers duel by a 3-1 score. Starter Miguel Gonzalez didn\xe2\x80\x99t win a game during the month of May (he was also on the DL for part of the month), but he started June with a buzz. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 5 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 7 K. \xc2\xa0In general the Orioles would like to put up more than three runs in games, but when you get starting pitching like that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be tough to beat.Courtesy of Bob Stanton-USA TODAY SportsHouston had runners at second and third in the last of the first, and J.D. Martinez made a bid for extra-bases or a homer. However his shot was pulled in by Orioles right fielder Chris Dickerson, and Houston was held to only the one run on a sac fly. Chris Davis and Adam Jones opened up the fourth inning with a single and a double respectively, with Davis scoring on Jones\xe2\x80\x99 double to tie the game. The Birds would then take a 2-1 lead on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single (following a Matt Wieters ground out which moved Jones to third base). The Birds would later add on an \xe2\x80\x9cinsurance run\xe2\x80\x9d (if that\xe2\x80\x99s possible in the fourth inning) with Chris Dickerson getting to third base and then scoring on a wild pitch by Houston starter Bud Norris. Incidentally, Norris matched Gonzalez almost pitch-for-pitch, however Houston bats couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pick him up in a sense and he ended up a hard-luck loser.Prior to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game the Orioles sent reliever Steve Johnson to the 15-day DL after he strained an oblique on Wednesday night. Johnson said that it was bothering him when he warmed up, and MASN cameras caught him grimacing a few times on the mound and in the dugout. Nevertheless, the Orioles went with a short bullpen in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s series finale in Houston and they called up OF Xavier Avery from triple-A Norfolk. With Nick Markakis out attending the funeral of his grandmother, Buck Showalter felt that an extra bench player made more sense in the short-term. Avery of course never saw action in the game, and was optioned back to Norfolk following it\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will need to make a roster move at some point before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game in Tampa, which will presumably involve a reliever. Steve Johnson will accompany the team to Tampa, at which point he\xe2\x80\x99ll head to the club\xe2\x80\x99s spring training facility in Sarasota to start rehabing that oblique. Jason Hammel will get the ball for the O\xe2\x80\x99s tonight, and will be opposed by Tampa starter Chris Archer.MLB Draft:\xc2\xa0Major League Baseball held it\xe2\x80\x99s first-year player draft last night, with the Orioles being in the bizzare position of picking late in the first round as opposed to having a top ten pick. With the 22nd pick in the draft, the Orioles selected North Carolina high school right-handed pitcher Hunter Harvey. The Orioles vision Harvey as a future front-line starter; he was 8-0 with an 0.38 ERA and 116 strikeouts. Harvey apparently has no urge to go to college, and wants to immediately get started on his professional career. The Orioles also selected center fielder Josh Hart from Parkview high school in Georgia. Hart is committed to Georgia Tech, however Baseball America views him as a top-of-the-order hitter. In the second round the Birds picked Chance Sisco of Corona Santiago high school in California. I think that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are probably pretty excited about the Harvey selection, as if there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that baseball proves day in and day out it\xe2\x80\x99s that you can never have enough pitching. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles 2013 Draft Day One Roundup: Hunter Harvey, Josh ...', ' The 2013 MLB Draft represents only the second time since 2001 that the Orioles have selected later than the 10th pick in the draft. As fans, we have gotten used to playing the game of, which high-profile prospect do you hope will drop to the Orioles\' pick, and which one of those guys do you want them to take? With picks in the top five every year since 2007, that was the normal thing. Thursday night, with the Orioles picking 22nd overall, there was none of that. It turns out that a side effect of having a good team is that the next year, there\'s no real way to familiarize yourself with the player that will be available then. There are so many possible permutations, all you can do is wait and see who the scouting director sends your way. The O\'s picked 22nd, 37th, and 61st overall. The 37th selection represented a pick in the first competitive balance round, sandwiched in between the first round and the second round. The Orioles were awarded that pick due to a combination of recent on-field futility and relative small market size. The others represented the usual first- and second-round picks. The Orioles ended up with these young men: 22: Hunter Harvey, RHP, Bandys HS, Catawba, NC37: Josh Hart, OF, Parkview HS, Lilburn, GA61: Chance Sisco, C, Santiago HS, Corona, CA These selections represent the first time since 1998 that the franchise used its first three selections on high school players. That was many GM-analogues, scouting directors, and player development departments ago. Just in case you were wondering, though, those three high schoolers from 1998 never played above high-A for the franchise, and only one made it to AA for any franchise. Drafting anyone is a bit of a dodgy proposition, but especially drafting 17- and 18-year olds.    ""It wasn\'t mapped out that way,"" admitted Orioles scouting director Gary Rajsich when asked about the three high school selections. ""We feel like we got three young players we really like that we can trust to our player development people."" Thirty scouting directors probably told thirty sets of beat reporters that they liked the players they got Thursday night, and they\'ll go on to say they like the entirety of their draft class as well.    Harvey, listed at 6\'3"", 175 lbs., represents the third consecutive first-round pick that the Orioles have used on a right-handed pitcher. He is the son of former MLB reliever Brian Harvey, who played in MLB over nine seasons before elbow injuries shelved him for good in 1995. Harvey has an older brother who played in the minor leagues as well. He has been surrounded by baseball his entire life, and one gets the impression that it is his sole goal to play in MLB. Whereas most prospects at least go through the motions of a college commitment in order to increase their leverage, Harvey did no such thing. Interviewed by phone on the MLB Network\'s draft telecast not long after his selection was announced, Harvey was asked about college. ""I\'ve never really been a fan of college,"" he said, ""or school in general."" The moment of candor was refreshing and funny.    Later, on a call with Orioles reporters, he was asked about negotiations. ""I think it\'ll be a very quick process,"" he said. ""I\'ve been waiting for this moment my whole life. Now that it\'s finally here, I don\'t want to mess around."" Rajsich was optimistic about getting Harvey signed quickly, where he will start out in the Gulf Coast League. While Harvey may not have much interest in college or school in general, in the few minutes he answered questions, he struck me as someone who is laser-focused on baseball and always looking to increase his understanding of the game. He broke down his own senior year as follows: ""Sat 91-95, got up a little higher (velocity) than that, didn\'t get to use my change-up much, mostly used fastball and curveball at my high school."" Harvey was also well aware that talent would be better at the next level. He said that he would need to mix up his pitches more, and work particularly on his change-up. He is fully aware that he will need to ""work his butt off"" to make it through the minor leagues, something he saw through his older brother. Rajsich predicted he will move quickly - don\'t they all - in perhaps three years. The selection of Hart with the competitive balance pick brings to mind Xavier Avery, who was the last athletic outfielder the Orioles took from a Georgia high school. Rajsich said that Hart was on the list of players they considered for their first round pick as well. He described Hart as ""a dynamic player in the middle of the field"" who just needs to get bigger and stronger and otherwise you don\'t have to project, though those two things are important elements of projecting players. Hart, like Avery, is on the short side, with Hart being an inch shorter at 5\'11"", currently listed at 172lbs. Rajsich believes he will stick in center field due to his speed and instincts. The MLB.com capsule on Hart gives this take:  Hart profiles as a top-of-the-order type, a guy who will use his speed on both sides of the ball to be a basestealing threat and an excellent defender in the outfield.  His optimistic outlook is described by this capsule as a Denard Span- or Ben Revere-type player. If the Orioles turn a draft pick into a Span-type player, that is a victory any time. Sisco, the second round pick, is 6\'2"" and listed at 193 lbs. He is a lefty-batting catcher, described by Rajsich as ""a hitter who catches."" Sisco only started catching this past year, with Rajsich calling him ""a natural, with a chance to learn and be a real good catcher."" The Orioles also believe that Sisco will develop some power. Rajsich said he likes the upside of all three of the picks, which, again, every scouting director will say. His MLB.com profile, which is not team-affiliated but probably also optimistic, says:  Sisco recently transitioned from shortstop to catcher, but has quickly shown the skills necessary to remain behind the plate long term. He has an average arm and has good hands.  It is similarly optimistic about his potential on offense, not filling our heads with notions that the next Buster Posey fell to the Orioles in the second round, but maybe, just maybe, they found a solid high school catcher they can bring along and develop. Have you looked at who\'s catching in the minors now? Yikes. Most players are not destined to be stars, especially not most players after the first few picks. People like Keith Law all think this is a weak draft to begin with. But you never really know what might happen once you throw guys into the minor leagues and see what happens. Harvey is unlikely to turn into another North Carolina sensation, Matt Harvey (no relation). Hart will probably not turn into Span. Sisco will probably not turn into Jorge Posada. Now they are in the hands of the player development staff, Lady Luck, and also themselves. If the scouting department is correct in assessing that the talent and drive are there, then the latest Orioles prospects might some day find themselves being cheered on in a sold-out Camden Yards. Right now, anything is possible. It\'s time to toss the dice.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('MLB Draft 2013: Baltimore Orioles select LHP Stephen ...', ' Tarpley is a 20-year-old lefty who is 6\'2"", 200 lbs, and can reportedly throw a 94 mph fastball. The Orioles used the 98th pick in the draft to select a lefty pitcher out of Scottsdale Community College, Stephen Tarpley. Born on 2/17/93, Tarpley was ranked the 64th best player in this year\'s draft by MLB.com. Here is what MLB.com has to say about him:  Scouting Grades* (present/future): Fastball: 5/6| Curve 4/5 | Slider: 4/6 | Changeup: 4/5 | Control: 4/5 | Overall: 4/5An eighth-round pick of the Cleveland Indians in 2011, Tarpley initially went to Southern California to start his college career. After one season there, he transferred to Scottsdale Community College, thus making him eligible for this year\'s Draft.The strong and athletic lefty can crank the fastball up to 94 mph with easy effort. Both his curve and slider can be at least average, if not better. His changeup is behind the breaking stuff, but should also be a Major League average pitch for him.Tarpley can throw strikes and has terrific mound presence. It\'s a combination, especially from the left side, that will intrigue many teams on Draft day, with an upside as a future member of a big league rotation.  Matt Garrioch\'s ranking at Minor League Ball doesn\'t like Tarpley as much, ranking him at #138.    Conor Glassey at Baseball America wrote a story on Tarpley back in February. It\'s short but worth checking out. He speaks Japanese and taught himself to play guitar, so he\'s a renaissance man. Keith Law wrote about Tarpley for ESPN Insider after watching him play in April. He claims he is a late second round or third round talent, and included this tidbit:  Tarpley left USC after his freshman year under a cloud of rumors, mostly  surrounding his off-field makeup, that will likely cause him to go  later in the draft than his raw ability would indicate. The fact that  his delivery often looks lazy, like he\'s just playing catch rather than  making an effort to finish all of his pitches out front, is more glaring  because of the makeup concerns. Perhaps cleaning up his delivery will  be about more than just teaching him to rotate his hips and lengthen his  stride.

(AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Chris Archer pitched seven strong innings and Desmond Jennings hit a two-run homer to lead the Tampa Bay Rays to a 2-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night. Archer (1-1) limited the Orioles to Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s third-inning RBI single and Ryan Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s fifth-inning double in his second start of the season. The 24-year-old right-hander spent the first two months of the season at Triple-A Durham and allowed five runs and seven hits in four innings of a 5-0 loss to Cleveland after being promoted to the majors last weekend. Jennings homered to the deepest part of the ball park in the seventh inning off Jason Hammel (7-4), who lost on the road for the first time this year after winning his first six decisions away from Camden Yards. Archer allowed one run, walked two and struck out two to earn his second career victory. Joel Peralta worked the eighth for the Rays, and Fernando Rodney finished the combined two-hitter with a perfect ninth for his 13th save in 18 opportunities. Hammel followed up his shortest outing of the season by taking a 1-0 lead into the seventh. The right-hander allowed five runs in three-plus innings of a 10-3 loss to Detroit last Saturday and was ejected from that game after yielding home runs to three consecutive batters and then hitting Matt Tuiasosopo with a pitch in the left shoulder. The Orioles starter yielded two runs and six hits in 6 2-3 innings this time. Archer began the season as one of the top prospects in Tampa Bay\xe2\x80\x99s minor league system. He made six appearances in the majors last season, including four starts, going 1-3 with a 4.60 ERA. The Rays starter walked Chris Dickerson and Nate McLouth ahead of Machado\xe2\x80\x99s two-out RBI single in the third. He gave up a two-out double to Flaherty in the fifth, but escaped further damage when Adam Jones grounded to shortstop to end the inning. Hammel, the first Baltimore pitcher to enter June with at least seven wins since Mike Mussina in 1999, was just as good through six innings. The Rays stranded runners in scoring position in the third and fourth innings, with Hammel retiring Kelly Johnson on a fly ball to right field to end one threat and getting Luke Scott to fly to center to stop the other. James Loney singled leading off the seventh for the fourth hit off Hammel. Jennings hit his sixth homer of the season to center field on the first pitch. NOTES: Reigning AL Cy Young Award winner David Price threw his first bullpen session since being placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left triceps. The Tampa Bay ace said he felt good after throwing 38 pitches.

06/10/2013,"[('Birds Watcher: Baltimore Orioles: All roads lead to\\u2026Baltimore', 'This morning I was listening to 98Rock\xe2\x80\x99s morning show, and host Mickey Cucchiella was discussing a wide arrange of topics with sportscaster Keith Mills (also of WBAL) during his (Mills\xe2\x80\x99) hourly segment. They were discussing the horse Secretariat being a \xe2\x80\x9cfreak of nature,\xe2\x80\x9d and revolutionizing horse racing forever. They went on to talk about how Cal Ripken Jr. of the Baltimore Orioles is also a guy who revolutionized his sport, and they also threw Johnny Unitas of the Baltimore Colts into that mix.Courtesy of USA TodayThat led me to thinking about Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s role in the sports world in general. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen my old man cry on three different occasions thus far in life; two of them were when his parents died, and the other was when the Colts left Baltimore. That\xe2\x80\x99s a sentiment that was probably shared by most Baltimoreans at the time, and much of that was due in part to the Unitas era (and to a lesser extent Bert Jones). That can be traced back to the 1958 NFL Title game, which is something that needs no description to Baltimore fans. As a result of that one game, Johnny Unitas revolutionized the game of football by revolutionizing it\xe2\x80\x99s most important position. Nowadays it seems that teams go up and down the field all the time at a feverish pace, however until that game nobody had ever seen a quarterback moving the ball like that\xe2\x80\xa6almost literally with no time left on the clock. That cemented the Colts and the city of Baltimore into NFL history forever, and I would submit that Johnny Unitas and the Baltimore Colts in the \xe2\x80\x9958 title game is the single greatest moment in that history.Courtesy of Jerry Lai-USA TODAY SportsThe Orioles and the city of Baltimore were cemented into MLB history by Cal Ripken Jr, albeit in a different manner. First off, the great tradition of baseball in the city was already there as a result of the great Orioles teams of the 60\xe2\x80\x99s, 70\xe2\x80\x99s, and early 80\xe2\x80\x99s. However what Cal achieved by breaking Lou Gerhig\xe2\x80\x99s consecutive games played record in September of 1995 set a standard for simply doing your job and doing it well. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to say that all the guy did was show up every day. But how many of us do that quite literally EVERY DAY, and take the type of punishment that professional athletes have to endure? Furthermore, in order to play in an eventual 2,632 consecutive games, you have to be pretty good.Having said that, the consecutive games played streak in and of itself did not revolutionize the game. However as people often say, timing is everything. In 1994 we saw the baseball season end in August due to a players strike. The end of the season, and eventually the World Series ended up being canceled, and the strike even ate up the first six weeks of the 1995 season. Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s popularity was at an all-time low, and for those of us who remember that probably recall that there were even some people wondering if that would spell the end of professional baseball at some point. Then at the end of that season Cal Ripken Jr. came along and broke the consecutive games played streak, generating an interest in America\xe2\x80\x99s pastime once again. As people commonly like to say, Cal Ripken \xe2\x80\x9csaved baseball.\xe2\x80\x9d People got behind the streak and they wanted to see history made, which brought them back to the sport when it deserately needed fans. So yes, all he did was show up on a daily basis. But that type of dedication saved the sport that we all love so much.I suppose that my point in using Unitas and Ripken is that the city of Baltimore as a whole has contributed in so many ways to the history of sports in America. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking squarely about your run-of-the-mill great players, or even championships. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s another city out that that can claim a football and baseball hero as having revolutionized their respective sports or positions. And the fact that the Ravens are now the defending world champions allows Baltimore football as a whole to bow once again before the sports world. The same can also be said of the current Orioles, who are the heirs to Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson, Paul Blair, Eddie Murray, and of course the great Cal Ripken Jr. All of these arguments are very relative and very subjective. But again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a big difference between just a regular superstar, and one who revolutionized a game or a position. Baltimore can claim two in two different sports, as football and baseball owe the likes of Johnny Unitas and Cal Ripken Jr. a debt of gratitudeFor the record, I would put Secretariat up there as one of the greatest athletes of all time. In a special that was run on ESPN this past weekend commemorating the 40th\xc2\xa0anniversary of his triple crown, a writer who covered the Belmont Stakes that year said that he was literally afraid that the jockey was going to kill the horse given how fast he was going. It became obvious that he was going to win the race (and thus the triple crown) on the back stretch; winning a race running away is one thing, but\xe2\x80\xa6winning by 31 lengths is another story. So let me say\xe2\x80\xa6Greatest. Race horse. Ever.

The offense, held to one run and six hits over the first two games of the series, produced 10 runs on 16 hits. Matt Moore, who came in 8-1, but blew up in this game, allowed career highs of nine runs and 12 hits in the five innings he worked. No doubt scoring 10 runs was a relief to Buck Showalter.The other relief came from the man who got three of those 16 hits, Adam Jones. He had a 3-for-5 day, including an RBI double and a solo homer that traveled a reported 457 feet to left-center field, the longest homer of his career.Jones\xe2\x80\x99 breakout was significant because he had been struggling for a few weeks, his average sinking steadily from its April-May levels to .300 coming into this game.\xc2\xa0Before his skid, Jones hit .311 (37 for 119) with a .546 slugging percentage, .890 OPS, seven doubles, seven home runs and 17 RBI in 28 May games.Through the first four games in June, Jones was batting .118 (2 for 17) with no extra-base hits or RBI.\xc2\xa0Jones also had seven strikeouts, which included a season-high four\xc2\xa0last Sunday against the Tigers.

Those 265 are also the second-most in baseball. Know who\xe2\x80\x99s first? Teammate Manny Machado, with 271. He has 14 walks and 40 strikeouts.\xc2\xa0Mike Trout, Jones\xe2\x80\x99 opponent this week, is right behind Jones with 256 at-bats, and he has 29 walks and 55 strikeouts.\xc2\xa0At the higher end of the spectrum, Cincinnati\xe2\x80\x99s Jay Bruce, fifth in baseball with 252 at-bats, has an ugly 78 strikeouts, tied for fourth-most in the majors, and 19 walks. At the lower end of the spectrum, Nick Markakis, also with 252 at-bats, has struck out an insanely low 22 times, to go with 19 walks.\xc2\xa0In the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 series at Houston last week, Jones hit the ball sharply a few times but right at people, and Astros second baseman Jose Altuve got to \xc2\xa0every grounder Jones hit up the middle. Altuve got to those balls because he was shaded up the middle on Jones. The reason an infielder would do that is if the scouting report said Jones rarely hits to right field. Jones\xe2\x80\x99 recent tendency was to try to pull everything.He had gotten beat on different kinds of pitches, not just the slider he is notorious for missing, and has struck out 52 times, after doing so 126 times last season. Not walking him is, of course, the approach of most pitchers, so that Chris Davis can\xe2\x80\x99t drive him in.Ironically, as Jones heated up Sunday, Chris Davis took an 0-for-5. His strikeouts are up in the past week, including two Sunday. He\xc2\xa0was hitless in 12 at-bats in the series and saw his average drop from .357 to .338. But with numbers as huge as his, you don\xe2\x80\x99t start worrying about his performance plummeting just yet.He is the leading vote-getter at first base for the All Star Game, and Jones is the leading outfield vote-getter, just ahead of\xc2\xa0Trout, with 1,944,450 votes.As possible as it is to point to holes in his game \xe2\x80\x93 his habit of eschewing the cutoff man and the fact that opposing runners take liberties on his strong yet erratic arm (twice Sunday) \xe2\x80\x93 it is still difficult to name an overall better center fielder in the American League.

06/11/2013,"[(""Orioles 4, Angels 3: O's hold on after rain delay to close ..."", "" A wild weather day in Baltimore that saw a funnel cloud over the harbor in Canton and a tornado warning in my neck of the woods led to a two hour and fifteen minute rain delay at Camden Yards. The Orioles held a lead when the torrential downpour finally was enough to convince home plate umpire Joe West to send the game into a rain delay. Despite a completely drenched field, play eventually resumed, and the O's held on for a 4-3 victory in the opening game against the Angels. This is the kind of game you might say that the Orioles stole. They deserved to win, but they did not look like the favorites going into it. With Freddy Garcia matching up against Jered Weaver, how could you feel good? As they always say: that's why they play the games. Early runs came on the board thanks to home runs. Mike Trout led off the scoring with his 11th home run of the year. He staked the Angels to a 1-0 lead in the third inning. Adam Jones countered in the fourth inning with a two-run shot off Weaver. I am sure it was a nice home run, though I must admit I was a little too busy to be watching it because there was a possible tornado possibly heading towards where I live. The rain that pelted my portion of the suburbs eventually arrived in downtown Baltimore. With the Orioles clinging to a 2-1 lead heading into the top of the fifth inning, the game looked like one of those where it would go final after it went official, and as Garcia sent down the Angels in the fifth, the game was official, with the Orioles having a lead. The game could end then and the Orioles would have won.    West pushed on as the rain increased in strength. That left enough time for Josh Hamilton to even up the score with a solo home run, his 9th of the year. Hamilton would end the game with a .390 slugging percentage, which is another way of saying that the Angels' $125 million man is being out-slugged by every Oriole in tonight's starting lineup except for Ryan Flaherty.    With the score tied, if the rains came, the game could not end. No problem, because West would keep the good times rolling in the monsoon, and the Orioles made the most of that in the bottom of the sixth. Nate McLouth, noted aficionado of 1980s music, reached base on a bunt and dug his way through the mud to steal second, his 22nd steal of the year. McLouth was then in scoring position, moving to third when Manny Machado flared a single into right field. Hamilton confidently strode up to get the ball into his glove and throw it home to keep McLouth from scoring. That was his intent. In practice, he overran the ball. McLouth scored and Machado took second on the error, giving the Orioles the lead once again. Machado moved to third on another flare single to left by Nick Markakis and scored when Jones hit a sacrifice fly.    The rain reached a level that even West could not ignore when Chris Davis grounded into a fielder's choice, with Markakis sliding through a mud puddle as he reached second base. That would do it for the starters. Weaver gave up six hits, a walk, and four earned runs in 5.2 IP. Garcia allowed five hits, a walk, and two runs (both on home runs) in six innings. For a while it looked like that should do it for the game, but the rain eventually stopped and the field was somehow made playable. The diligence of the Orioles grounds crew was rewarded by Tommy Hunter coming on in relief and loading the bases in the top of the seventh inning. He gave up a walk, single, and walk, which brought up Hamilton, who hit a pathetic, weak grounder to the one part of the infield where no out could be recorded. A run scored on the play, cutting the Orioles lead to 4-3. The next two batters were Albert Pujols and Mark Trumbo. If you expected a grand slam, you are like me. Hunter struck out Pujols and got Trumbo to ground to second. Angels reliever Garrett Richards held the Orioles from adding any insurance runs. Weird baseball potential loomed large if Jim Johnson should slip up with the slim lead in the ninth. The bad JJ of the middle of last month showed no signs of appearing. He induced three easy groundouts to end the game with no drama and record his 22nd save of the season. That is the way they drew it up. The O's go back to eight games above .500 with the win, their 16th in 29 home games. They'll be back in action against these Angels tomorrow night at 7:05pm.

Jim Duquette Talks Orioles Baseball ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), ('Orioles 3, Angels 2: Pitching, Defense, and Three ...', "" Apparently, being an expectant father is good for your stat line. Or something. Miguel Gonzalez had one of the most dominant performances of his career tonight, flashing some of his best stuff and pairing it with excellent command. The Orioles needed that, as they once again struggled to score off of Jason Vargas, but this time managed to come away with the win in the end. The O's helped Gonzalez set the Angels down in order in the first, as Mike Trout and Josh Hamilton both hit the ball hard. However, Manny Machado made a nice diving stop on Trout's grounder - and still threw him out, impossible without Manny's arm strength - and Adam Jones ran down Hamilton's long flyball. In the bottom of the inning, Machado singled to right with one down, and J.J. Hardy hit a long fly ball to center, but Peter Bourjos made a tremendous catch to rob Hardy of a two-run homer. It was strangely reminiscent of last year, as Hardy helped add to Mike Trout's amazing season when the rookie also pulled a home run back over the wall at Camden Yards. With Adam Jones up and two down, Machado got picked off at first base, ending the inning.The baseball gods began to have bit of a laugh in the second. Miguel Gonzalez started things off by striking out Mark Trumbo, but then gave up a bloop single to Howie Kendrick. Just as Birdland began to groan about cheap hits, Erick Aybar lined the first pitch he saw right to Chris Davis, who stepped on first base for the double play. Then, in the bottom of the inning, Jones and Davis each attempted to beat out an infield hit; Jones may have been safe but didn't get the call, while Davis was definitely out but called safe. Matt Wieters and Danny Valencia both made outs, though, ending the inning.In the fourth inning, the Angels put the first run of the game onto the scoreboard, as Mike Trout hit a leadoff solo shot to deep center. More weirdness ensued in the bottom half of the inning, when J.J. Hardy got called out on fan interference - an Angels fan reached over onto the field of play down the left-field line and prevented Mike Trout from  catching a foul ball. Later, in the sixth, Peter Bourjos hit a sharp grounder right back to Miguel Gonzalez. Gonzalez, committed to getting outs by any and all means, deflected it with his rear end and threw in time to first, despite Bourjos's speed. Nick Markakis followed that play with a tough grab up against the wall in foul territory. I'm not sure which was more impressive: the catch, or the fact that he managed to make it without getting hurt. Ryan Flaherty led off the bottom of the inning and slapped an opposite-field single to try to start a rally. Markakis followed him with an 0-2 line-drive single to the right-center gap, which Bourjos bobbled, giving the O's runners on second and third with no outs and their best scoring chance of the night. Manny Machado grounded to second, but with the Angels' infield playing back, that was enough to score a run, tie the game, and move Markakis to third with one out. Hardy and Jones both grounded out as well, though, and with the Angels' infield now playing in, the game remained tied, 1-1. The baseball gods returned to sow chaos and absurdity in the seventh. Miguel Gonzalez began the inning by walking Albert Pujols on four pitches. He then struck out Mark Trumbo on three. After that, Howie Kendrick managed an extended at-bat, but Gonzalez won the battle, getting a comebacker to start a 1-6-3 double play. In the bottom half, Danny Valencia, Steve Pearce, and Ryan Flaherty managed back-to-back-to-back infield hits with two down. Yes, you read that correctly. This ended Jason Vargas's night, and Mike Scioscia turned to lefty reliever Scott Downs to face Nick Markakis. Nick came through with the big hit of the night, a two-run line-drive single to center. Righty Michael Kohn came in to face Manny Machado, but Manny struck out and wasn't able to add onto the O's new 3-1 lead.    Gonzalez went back to work in the eighth and had an easy 1-2-3 inning, ending with ninety-six pitches. While I think most everyone - except perhaps the Angels - wanted to see Miguel go for the complete game, Buck called upon Jim Johnson to pitch the ninth. Johnson, of course, knows that no Oriole victory is complete without a scary moment or two, and after two quick outs, Josh Hamilton laced a double to the right-field scoreboard. Pujols followed that up with a bounder up the middle, and suddenly the Angels had the tying run on first base. Johnson, having fulfilled the team's obligation to make Birdland nervous at least once per game, got ahead of Mark Trumbo 0-2 on three inside pitches, and then froze him with a fastball on the outside corner. O's win, 3-2. The Red Sox lost tonight, and as I write, the A's are leading the Yankees in Oakland, 2-0, top 4. The Orioles have thus picked up a game in the AL East standings, now sitting 2.5 games behind the Red Sox, and perhaps just one game behind the Yankees if the A's can maintain their lead. Tomorrow, in an early 12:35 start, Jason Hammel will oppose Jerome Williams.

Light-hitting Ryan Flaherty contributed two well-timed hits for the Orioles, whose third straight victory put them a season-high nine games over .500 (37-28). Baltimore will seek to complete a three-game sweep on Wednesday afternoon. The Angels lost their fourth in a row despite a home run by Mike Trout that traveled an estimated 448 feet. Angels center fielder Peter Bourjos made the defensive play of the night, robbing J.J. Hardy of a two-run homer in the first inning. After retreating toward the warning track, Bourjos pressed his body against the wall with a perfectly timed leap, stuck his glove well over the 7-foot barrier and caught the ball. Gonzalez (4-2) gave up four hits, walked one and struck out five. Jim Johnson got two outs in the ninth before Josh Hamilton doubled and scored on a single by Albert Pujols. Johnson then struck out Mark Trumbo to earn his 23rd save, and second in two nights. Howie Kendrick had two hits for Los Angeles, which has dropped nine of 11. Jason Vargas (5-4) allowed three runs, seven hits and a walk in 6 2-3 sharp innings. The loss ended the left-hander\xe2\x80\x99s five-game winning streak \xe2\x80\x94 a run that started with a shutout of Baltimore on May 3. Vargas was pulled after the Orioles used two-out infield hits by Danny Valencia, Steve Pearce and Flaherty to load the bases in the seventh. Markakis then lined a single off Scott Downs for a 3-1 lead. Trout put the Angels up 1-0 in the fourth with his 12th home run, the second in two nights. It\xe2\x80\x99s the ninth time in his career he\xe2\x80\x99s homered in successive games. In the bottom half, Hardy was thwarted in a second straight at-bat. After being earlier victimized by Bourjos, Hardy popped a foul toward the seats in left. As Trout prepared to make the catch, a fan wearing a Trout jersey stuck his glove in the way. The ball bounced off the fan\xe2\x80\x99s mitt and landed on the ground, but third base umpire Joe West called Hardy out because of fan interference. Held to two hits through five innings, the Orioles pulled even in the sixth. No. 9 hitter Flaherty singled and Markakis followed with a single that momentarily handcuffed Bourjos for an error, putting runners at second and third. Manny Machado followed with an RBI grounder, providing Baltimore with its first run against Vargas in 15 innings this season. NOTES: Markakis is 9 for 26 (.346) with 10 RBIs with two outs and runners in scoring position. \xe2\x80\xa6 Machado extended his hitting streak to nine games with a first-inning single before being picked off first base by Angels C Chris Iannetta. \xe2\x80\xa6 Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Davis ended an 0-for-16 skid with an infield hit in the first inning, although replays showed he was out at first. \xe2\x80\xa6 Seven of the nine homers Gonzalez has allowed have come at home. \xe2\x80\xa6 Jason Hammel (1-3, 7.33 ERA at home) starts for the Orioles in the series finale Wednesday.

There was usually one obvious standout like Brian Roberts or Miguel Tejada, but until the Orioles placed three guys on last year\'s American League squad, they had been represented by the one-player minimum in 10 of the previous 11 seasons.That was no great injustice, considering the club was in the midst of a string of 14 consecutive losing seasons. It was simply indicative of the quality of baseball being played at Camden Yards and the waning enthusiasm for it by the team\'s long-suffering fans. var adSkipCounter = 0; To put it another way, it simply was what it was, but the good news is that it isn\'t that way anymore.The Orioles are not only well represented in the voting for this year\'s starting American League lineup, you could make the case that they are dominating it. When the latest vote totals were released last week, first baseman Chris Davis was holding a huge lead over Detroit Tigers first baseman Prince Fielder, Adam Jones was the top vote-getter among outfielders and J.J. Hardy had moved into the lead at shortstop.That\'s what you call respect, and it doesn\'t stop there. Catcher Matt Wieters and third baseman Manny Machado ranked second at their positions, and both Nick Markakis and Nate McLouth joined Jones among the top eight outfielders. Second base and DH were the only positions (subject to the fan vote) where there wasn\'t an Oriole at or near the top of the list.""For me, it\'s exciting to see this many Orioles to be able to be up there,\'\' said Wieters, already a two-time All-Star. ""In years past, even though we feel like we\'ve had some good players, to even be in consideration for the All-Star Game, it really hasn\'t been something where we really felt we had a chance to win the voting. It\'s more a compliment to what this team has done and how this city supports baseball. You put a winning team out there and the fans are going to support you.""Give credit where credit it is due. The big vote totals are \xe2\x80\x94 to some extent \xe2\x80\x94 a sign that the rest of the country has taken notice of the Orioles after last year\'s playoff run and this year\'s team-wide offensive surge, but it\'s really about the revitalization of the club\'s fan base and a big effort by the team to get everyone to ""Vote Orange.""""It\'s a sign nationally,\'\' said Jones, who appears to be a lock for his third All-Star selection, ""but it is a sign that Birdland is really dedicated to their city and their team. There are a lot of fans around baseball who are pulling for us, but you have to give a lot of respect to your own fan base. They account for most of your votes. I see it on Twitter all the time. They\'re telling me, \'We\'re voting for you. We\'re voting for you, Davis, Machado, Hardy, Markakis, McLouth, Wieters.\' They\'re just non-stop, creating accounts just to vote for us. It\'s pretty humbling that our local fans want to see us represented at the All-Star Game and it shows that we\'re really bringing baseball back in this region.""There is the possibility that as many as six Orioles could end up representing Baltimore at Citi Field in New York during the third week of July. Davis and Jones look like they\'ll be in the starting lineup. Hardy is in a close race with Rangers star Elvis Andrus for the start at short. Wieters is right behind Twins catcher Joe Mauer.Manny Machado isn\'t going to outpoll Miguel Cabrera, but he\'s one of the game\'s brightest young players, he\'s having a terrific first full major league season and he has no problem running second behind the first Triple Crown winner in almost a half-century.""You\'re talking about the greatest hitter in the game right now,\'\' Machado said. ""To be in the same category as that guy is just very humbling. It\'s awesome, actually.""Those are just the position players. Closer Jim Johnson, who matched Mariano Rivera for the league lead in saves with his 23rd on Tuesday night, also will get serious consideration.""It\'s awesome,\'\' Davis said. ""That\'s what we work hard for. It\'s a sign of us doing the right things, not only individually but as a team. It\'s a reward for all the hard work and I think it\'s a great message the fans are communicating to us that there are watching, they are paying attention and they are obviously behind us.""For once, the Orioles\' representation at the All-Star Game may be limited by the requirement that every other team send at least one player, but that\'s a pretty good problem to have after all the years the Orioles seemed fortunate to be sending anyone.""I think it would be great for the players and the organization, but most importantly the fans, to be recognized by the people who are the reason we\'re doing all this,\'\' said manager Buck Showalter. ""It\'s still the best All-Star Game in sports. You love to see guys get recognized. Selfishly, I\'d like them to have the time off, but I don\'t look at anything that recognizes our players as a negative. These guys are good people, too. They are representative of not only the game, but of Baltimore.

He burned them again last night by limiting them to one run in an eight inning outing. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 8 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 5 K. Over those eight innings Gonzalez also only threw 96 pitches. This is exactly the type of outing for which the O\xe2\x80\x99s had been looking on a more consistent basis from their starter. And make no mistake about the fact that it comes at a good time for the club, as they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to turn around and play an afternoon matinee in the series finale against Anaheim today.It does seem that whenever Anaheim comes to town someone\xe2\x80\x99s getting robbed of a homer in center field. J.J. Hardy hit what should have been a home run to the deepest part of the park, but Peter Bourjos climbed the fence and brought it back in.

However as Buck Showalter says, \xe2\x80\x9csometimes you just have to tip your cap.\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s really no other way to look at it. To that point, Mike Trout\xe2\x80\x99s solo homer in the fourth inning gave Anaheim the lead first. Trout seems to really like hitting at Camden Yards, and he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not the first visiting player to get into a groove in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s park. However Trout\xe2\x80\x99s homers are also coming with nobody on, which is when Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers are feeling more confident in challenging him. That still means that you have to score two to beat them, however with what Oriole bats are capable of doing that\xe2\x80\x99s generally not going to be a problem.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsThe Orioles covered the corners right off the bat in the last of the sixth due to an error by Bourjos in center field, and Manny Macado\xe2\x80\x99s ground out-RBI scored Ryan Flaherty and tied the score. With two outs in the seventh Danny Valencia, Steve Pearce, and Flaherty each hit infield singles to load the bases. That brought Nick Markakis to the plate, and his RBI-single plated two runs and \xc2\xa0put the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat 3-1. For the most part, Gonzalez never got himself into many jams, and turned in possibly his best outing of the season. I would have considered giving him the ball again in the ninth, but Showalter summoned Jim Johnson from the bullpen. Anaheim actually did put one across following a Josh Hamilton double and an Albert Pujols RBI-single, however Johnson struck out the next batter (Mark Trumbo) to close out the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 3-2 victory.This win is also noteworthy for the Orioles because both Boston and New York also lost last night. The Birds still stand in third place in the division, but they\xe2\x80\x99re now 2.5 games back of first place Boston, while New York is 2 games back. That of course makes this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s series with Boston at Camden Yards all the more big, however the Orioles first need to finish up their business with Anaheim in an afternoon matinee game at 12:30 today.

In a good and a bad way. The Orioles have blasted 86 HR\xe2\x80\x99s in 2013. That total trails only the Atlanta Braves (88) in all of baseball. Chris Davis, Adam Jones and J.J.

Jason Hammel has been very giving, as well, as he has been touched for 12 taters. However, Freddy Garcia has been lit up for 13 home runs in only eight starts. Needless to say, he tends to leave them over the plate just a bit. The good thing , if there is a good thing about allowing HR\xe2\x80\x99s, is that 57 of the 90 bombs hit against the Orioles have been solo shots. So they\xe2\x80\x99re not really being decimated by the long ball. That being said, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure manager Buck Showalter and pitching coach Rick Adair would like to see those numbers decrease.

The names with the biggest potential go in the first round, and other players who may be polished into big leaguers go in the few rounds after that. Though there are late-round success stories here and there, most fall into one of two categories: high schoolers who go to college to improve their draft stock, or marginal players who will grind out life in the minor leagues until it beats the hope out of them. Of the high schoolers, most never amount to anything, either. The Orioles have selected players like Michael Young, Cliff Lee, and Cecil Fielder in the late rounds. They did not sign and later were drafted again and eventually became veteran major league players. Most are not like these. They are afterthoughts, if they are even thought about at all. They are no one. They are on no one\'s radar. Their stories do not matter to the Orioles or anyone else. You will never read about them and they will go on to be something other than major league baseball players, forgotten by the baseball world before they were ever even known. There are a thousand players or more like this in every draft. This is a completely made-up background story about one of those players.    ** DUSTIN HAGYRound: 31 Overall pick: 939RHP - Trinity Christian Academy (FL) For much of the relatively brief time that he had inhabited the Earth, Dustin Hagy felt he was out of place. Even as a star baseball player on the 2012 Florida State Championship baseball team for the Trinity Christian Academy, there was one key way where he always felt that he never quite fit in. No matter that he was a 6\'6"" right-handed pitcher who could tantalize as his frame filled out.    Sure, he belonged on the baseball team. That was not in doubt. What set apart Dustin was the strange impulse, before each inning, to contort his body into representations of letters. He could not stop it at any time. People stared. He did not care. He felt a deep longing to do this for reasons that he never understood. All he knew was that before he took the mound, he had to do this:    ""E!"" he shouted, kicking one leg up and holding out his arms to try to approximate an E. ""A!"" This was a self-evident step to anyone who had ever done the YMCA, which should include anyone who had ever been to a sporting event, Dustin believed. ""G!"" No one who ever witnessed this ritual could ever explain how Dustin formed the G. Dustin himself could not explain it. He knew it like he knew the back of his hand. He sometimes thought he was born knowing, which was ridiculous, and also possibly true. ""L!"" It looked a lot like the E, only without the middle prong. ""E!"" ""S!"" There was once a dance craze for the song Walk Like An Egyptian. The S came from a moment frozen in that time from that craze, or so he supposed. After that, he could pitch. The impulse was not one that developed when he went to the private high school. No matter what team he ever played on, he wanted to do this, the spelling out of the names. Burger King-sponsored Little League team? He would set to spelling it. Summer travel team? This name, too, he must spell out. No one could ever explain it. Not his parents, not his friends, not his coaches. They all thought he was crazy. They never said anything, but he knew they thought it. June 6, 2013 was the day of destiny for Dustin. It was the day of Dustiny. He thought that but never told anyone, because they\'d only laugh and not in a good way. He watched the MLB Network coverage of the draft, just in case. No scout ever came and told him he could be a first-round pick and no one ever approached his family about signing, but you never know. Something weird might happen. He was not drafted. He waited by the phone on the next day of the draft, watching the little webcast with Jonathan Mayo and Jim Callis, just in case he got picked in rounds 3-10 too, although he knew better, because he was planning to go to college and was not a top-flight prospect and he was now precisely the kind of player who does not get drafted in rounds 3-10. He was not drafted. The next day, rounds 11-40, Dustin sat around playing MLB The Show all day. He had his phone with him and looked at it every 30 seconds in case he missed a call. There were two wrong number calls to torment him. He forgot about it all after a while. Then his phone rang. It was Firework by Katy Perry, another thing everyone found strange about him. Dustin answered the phone. It was the Baltimore Orioles, the voice said, and they wanted him to know they had taken him in the 31st round of the draft. Right then, at that moment, he experienced the strangest sensation: like his life had fallen into place. This made no sense at all. He knew he would not sign. The economics of the draft were such that they could not offer him money to make it worth signing in the 31st round. And yet, that feeling. On the mantle, there was a long-forgotten photograph of Dustin from his Little League days, wearing the ornithologically-correct bird hat and an orange jersey. This was not the reason why he felt as if everything had come full circle. He perceived it was part of it, but could not put his finger on the rest. The next day, he decided to Google himself. He wanted to know if he rated an article in the local newspaper, the West Volusia Beacon. (He did not.) He entered this search: ""baltimore orioles hagy"" He found this. He shed one single tear. His life was now complete. He understood. Maybe he would project into his frame and learn enough about off-speed pitches to be drafted again, and maybe the Orioles would take him again. Even if not, the great mystery of his life had been solved. That was his true Dustiny, and it always had been. ** Author\'s note: this post is a joke.

06/16/2013,"[('Bizzare final play costs the Orioles - Birds Watcher', 'Alexi Casilla made a pretty big base running blunder on the final play of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s 5-4 loss to Boston. With one down Casilla was on first with Ryan Flaherty at the plate. Flaherty hit a fading liner towards right field, which appeared ready to fall for a base hit. That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what Casilla thought was going to happen, as he was on his way to third base. However Boston right fielder Shane Victorino somehow got to the ball. Victorino almost came across as guilty as he threw the ball back to first base for the final out as the Baltimore Orioles fell 5-4 in game three of a four-game set.To his credit, Casilla said after the game that he blew it. He called it the worst base running in the game. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be very honest; while there\xe2\x80\x99s little room for excuses in these situations in baseball, I do feel a twinge of sympathy for Casilla. As aggravating as that play had to be for Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans to see, sometimes athletes do things like that which just can\xe2\x80\x99t be explained. Casilla\xe2\x80\x99s blunder is hardly up there with the likes of Roy \xe2\x80\x9cwrong way\xe2\x80\x9d Riegels or Jim Marshall, who picked up fumbles and ran the wrong way in football (scoring for the opposition). We\xe2\x80\x99ve all heard the term \xe2\x80\x9csomething just clicked into place;\xe2\x80\x9d in some cases the opposite happens.Freddy Garcia was haunted by the long ball once again yesterday afternoon. Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.1 IP, 8 H, 5 R, 1 BB, 3 K. Garcia started off strong by retiring Boston quickly in the first inning to bring the homestanding O\xe2\x80\x99s to bat. The Birds put two runs on the board quickly on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-double, and Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-single on a swinging bunt. Machado is really raking the doubles, as that was his 31st of the season. The home run power for Machado isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite there consistently yet, however he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly using every part of the field to get balls down and into play. And that\xe2\x80\x99s fine with the Orioles and Buck Showalter, who thus far is looking like a genius in batting Machado second. I was in the camp that raised their eyebrows at the beginning of the season when I heard that, but the results are unquestioned.The big turning point in the game came in the fourth inning with the Birds still holding that 2-0 lead. Dustin Pedroia appeared to swing-and-miss on a two-strike count. At first home plate umpire Jeff Nelson appeared to call a strike, but Pedroia insisted that he foul tipped the ball. Nelson eventually concurred and Pedroia singled to center on the next pitch. He proceeded to steal second after a David Ortiz strikeout, and Mike Carp tied the game at two with a home run. Jonny Gomes would single and eventually score on Drew\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double to give Boston the lead at 3-2.Courtesy ofJoy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsGarcia wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the same after that incident with Dustin Pedroia, who admitted after the game that he never fouled the ball off. Buck Showalter came out to argue with Jeff Nelson, however it was to no avail. According to Pedroia, after Nelson called strike three he simply said that he felt he fouled the ball off and Nelson immediately reversed course and said \xe2\x80\x9cfoul ball.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s the part that sticks out at me, and that should frustrate Orioles fans the most. If Pedroia says he fouled it off, then he must have fouled it off\xe2\x80\xa6? Catcher Taylor Teagarden inadvertently dropped the ball, which added to the illusion that Pedroia had fouled the ball off from Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s vantage point. I think that the Orioles can accept that umpires blow minor things like that, however in my opinion the glaringly bad part is the fact that Nelson just accepted Pedroia\xe2\x80\x99s testimony on the skip and changed his call. (That also seemed to aggravate Buck Showalter, who later had a shouting match with Nelson over balls and strikes from the dugout.)As bad of a break as that was, Garcia also admitted that he has to overcome that. That\xe2\x80\x99s tough no doubt, however it\xe2\x80\x99s something that needs to be done if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to put your team in a position to win. The effort and contribution of T.J. McFarland can\xe2\x80\x99t be overlooked in this game either. McFarland entered following Garcia, and pitched the rest of the game for the Orioles as he\xe2\x80\x99s done on numerous other occasions. Going into this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s series finale the Birds will now have a rested bullpen in the later innings. Against a team like Boston that fouls off so many pitches, that\xe2\x80\x99s a huge advantage.The BoSox would put two more runs across and head to the last of the ninth up 5-2. However following Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 single after working the count on Boston closer Andrew Bailey, Matt Wieters slugged the Birds back into the game with a homer onto the flag court in right field. However with Casilla getting picked off at first, it was not to be for the Birds. This was really a bizzare game all-around. As easy as it is to blame Casilla, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be overlooked that Boston got an extra out in the Pedroia sequence. Pedroia obviously came into score, and low and behold the Birds lost by a run in the end. Boston starter John Lackey also committed a clear balk that left Nate McLouth screaming at first base in the fifth, but it was never called. (Showalter also mentioned that in his postgame presser; the O\xe2\x80\x99s were obviously not happy with the umpiring yesterday overall.) McLouth was later caught stealing. But that\xe2\x80\x99s baseball.The Orioles are still in a position to take the series this afternoon with Miguel Gonzalez on the mound facing off against Jon Lester, who\xe2\x80\x99s owned the Birds throughout his career. He\xe2\x80\x99s 14-1 against them overall, and 7-0 at the yard. However keep in mind that most of those wins were against pretty lousy Orioles teams. We\xe2\x80\x99re now in a different era.

Whether it\'s his poise being discussed, his spraying doubles at a potential record pace, his defense, his speed on the basepaths, he draws well-deserved praise. More than merely just holding his own at the major league level, Machado has performed at a level putting him up among the best players in all of baseball. Orioles fans know better than most that a hot start by a young player does not mean they will continually perform at that level. A very recent example is Nick Markakis. The hope is always there, and having watched a lot of Orioles teams, I am willing to say there is something different and special about Machado. The talent that drove him to be called up to MLB at age 20 and contribute in a big way in a quest for the playoffs is talent that should, barring some disaster scenario, allow him to be a star or superstar player for years to come. With most baseball players, the intersection between the typical aging curve with the six or seven years of team control before free agency means that a player is, at best, going to reach the free agent market at the tail end of his 20s, passing out of his prime and into what is, for most players, the decline phase. He could still be productive, but he will probably not be the player he was. The exciting young class that includes Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, and Machado makes up a group of players that could completely turn contracts on their head. These 20- and 21-year olds will hit free agency still in their primes, and if they continue performing at anywhere near the level they have to open their careers, they could draw eye-popping contract figures on the open market.    If Machado plays through the years of team control without an extension, he would hit the free agent market, and play half of the first season of any contract, at the age of 26. Very few players are good enough to be able to do this. Even advanced college players tend to get a couple of years of seasoning in the minor leagues. Whether a player is out of high school or college, if he debuts at age 23, he\'ll probably hit free agency at age 29 or 30, meaning that the team gets that player\'s prime years at controlled cost.    The free agent market every offseason is full of players whom their teams decided were not worth bringing back at near what they could command on the open market, probably because their best years are behind them. This is the chance the St. Louis Cardinals took in letting Albert Pujols walk, and so far they have been proven right. The New York Yankees are probably dedicating significant brainpower towards making this calculation about Robinson Cano. Guys like that will play out most, if not all, of their free agent contracts on the wrong side of 30. The best players still have many productive years into their 30s. Recent baseball history is also littered with players whom teams talked themselves into who were not able to age so gracefully. The Angels could be facing this problem with both Pujols and Josh Hamilton.    Machado does not have to worry about all of that because he will play three full seasons in his 20s on his next contract. A ten-year contract given to a 25-year old looks a lot better than a ten-year contract given to a 32-year old. The best illustration of this is Alex Rodriguez, whose ten-year, $252 million deal signed with Texas prior to the 2001 season was almost unbelievable in its scope. And yet, Rodriguez was so good that, for what should have been the life of that deal, he earned the money. A world where that kind of money awaits Machado when he hits free agency is not hard to imagine. The skills he already has are those of a player you want on your team for a long time, and if others develop, like home run power and an increase in walk rate, then he will have a place among the best in baseball for many, many years. What would it take to ensure that all of what should be his best years are played for the Orioles? Once, it seemed unlikely that Machado would ever extend with the Orioles, as he was represented by Scott Boras when he was drafted. Machado has since switched his representation to Dan Lozano, the same agent as, among others, Pujols and Joey Votto. Pujols signed a contract extension with St. Louis in 2004, his first arbitration-eligible season, that bought out five years of free agency. Votto signed a contract extension just prior to the 2012 season that went for ten years on top of his arbitration-eligible seasons. Two active players have followed a path that could be a blueprint for what to do with Machado, if he and the team both decided to lock in his salaries this early in his career. They are Evan Longoria and Troy Tulowitzki, each of whom signed multi-year extensions with club options covering free agent years not long into their careers. Longoria signed a six-year, $17.5 million guaranteed deal after he had played six games. This included three club options that could increase the value to nine years, $44.5 million. The contract was viewed as extremely team-friendly. Tulowitzki played in 25 games in 2006 and signed a six-year, $31 million guaranteed deal after his first full season in 2007. This was the largest contract ever given to a pre-arbitration player at the time. This deal included one option year, making it potentially seven years, $44 million. In each case, the initial contract was extended a second time into a contract that will keep the player with that team for years to come and set them up comfortably for life and generations. Tulowitzki\'s contract is the best comparison for Machado because Machado\'s service time after this season will be similar to Tulowitzki\'s when he signed his first contract. Tulowitzki\'s contract had these increasing annual salaries: $750,000, $1 million, $3.5 million, $5.5 million, $8.25 million, $10 million, with a $15 million option year. He was given this contract after winning the NL Rookie of the Year award in 2007, when he batted .291/.359/.479 with 33 doubles and 24 home runs. He also had 99 RBI, which you and I don\'t care about but arbitration panels do, and therefore so do agents and general managers. Machado, through Sunday\'s game, is batting .327/.358/.495. He has 32 doubles already, keeping his overall power numbers near Tulowitzki\'s from 2007 despite a much less frequent rate of hitting home runs. He walks less, meaning his OBP is more batting average-driven, but also strikes out less. Machado has 37 RBI. Both your eyes and defensive metrics tell you he excels in the field: he will deserve a Gold Glove, but may not win one. He would be the easy AL Rookie of the Year this year if only he hadn\'t used up his rookie eligibility helping to boost the Orioles into the playoffs last season. That Machado deserves a contract similar to Tulowitzki and Longoria should not be a question. Those contracts were negotiated by the same agent, who is not Lozano. He may have a philosophy to wait for the talent to distinguish itself in pre-arbitration years, meaning more money will come in a contract locking in salary through what would have been arbitration years: Votto signed for three years, $38 million, earning more guaranteed money in those years than the other players did in six years. Even so, the Orioles should try to make a contract extension happen soon. If Machado is worth the money Tulowitzki made after 2007, then he\'s worth more now. Inflation and the symbolic value of making more money than some other guy are important considerations. If Tulowitzki got $31 million guaranteed, let\'s say Machado should get $36 million guaranteed and fill in the rest. A hypothetical offer to Machado might look like this: 2014: $850,0002015: $1.25 million2016: $4 million2017: $6.25 million2018: $9.25 million2019: $11.25 million2020: $16 million (club option with $3 million buyout) That is six years with $35.85 million in guaranteed money, which could become seven years and $48.85 million in all. Machado has one year of free agency bought out, which will almost certainly become two years unless something terrible happens. He would still be just 28 at the end of such a contract, and if he continued to realize his star potential, he could pursue a second, much larger contract if he chose. Eight years and $200 million or more does not sound out of the question with the current salary landscape. Machado gets security against injuries - though he seems durable so far, playing every inning since his call-up - and slumps. He will get paid whatever happens to him. The Orioles get cost certainty and are not out a large amount of money even if Machado does not continue at this star level. They hopefully also get a reputation for doing right by Machado, so if, three or four years down the road in our hypothetical world, Machado is still performing at a high level and showing no signs of stopping, both sides might be amenable to adding more years on the back end. A contract extension at a slight discount, perhaps with a no-trade clause, could then be worth more to Machado than the uncertainty of free agency. All of that is talk for far into the future, but if the Orioles would like to think about retaining the services of Machado beyond his years of team control, the time to start planning is now. The blueprint is there to follow and they can and should start laying the foundations to ensure that Manny Machado has the chance to be the next great Oriole for most or all of a long career.

The bad news is that it is rather easy to achieve bum status with your fan base, as all it takes sometimes is a bit of a slump. The good news is that it is likewise rather easy (in terms of a window of time) to achieve hero status.The fans of the Orioles are no worse than any others; they are probably in fact better than most in terms of supporting their team. But over the early part of this season we have seen quite a few different guys labeled as a goat. I don\xe2\x80\x99t generally buy into this very quickly \xe2\x80\x93 am just noting the pattern particularly evident on comment boards.Last year\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 5 darling Ryan Flaherty has not escaped some rather severe criticisms. His defense is rightly applauded \xe2\x80\x93 the skill that keeps him in the lineup. But his hitting has been very weak for the most part, though he seems somewhat improved after his trip to AAA. But if his ninth-inning 375-foot foul ball would have been on the Flag Court on Saturday for a walk-off win, all of this would have been quickly forgotten.Likewise, this year\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 5 guy T.J. McFarland has been a frequent flyer on message boards, as fans ponder if the Orioles can afford to keep a non-critical-situations innings eater on the roster for the whole season. But several very commendable recent outings have given his stock at least a short-term rise in valuation.And has anyone heard the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cTommy Home Run Hunter\xe2\x80\x9d used lately? But again, on the flip side, no less than Jim Johnson hit the goat list for a time, as has Taylor Teagarden, Jason Hammel, and just about every person batting as the DH.But the bum of the week for last week was Pedro Strop. He is still not out of the goat house.

Like Strop, he is a difficult guy to defend. The best I can say in that regard is this: \xc2\xa0since he is pitching tonight in a spot start, his career ERA against the Detroit Tigers is 1.46, and the combined batting average of their current team against him is .194 \xe2\x80\xa6 and yes, I know it is a small sample size.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed that major league baseball teams are signing players to more and more contracts like that one, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s are no exception. In effect, a team signs a player to a minor league contract that comes with the stipulation that he can opt out of the deal on a certain date if he\xe2\x80\x99s not in the big leagues by that time.Courtesy of USA TodayI\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest; I\xe2\x80\x99m not a fan of that type of contract. I\xe2\x80\x99ll grant that it is an inventive way for teams to sign players that they otherwise might not have been able to sign. It dangles a carrot in front of the player in a sense. And again I\xe2\x80\x99ll grant that the Orioles have directly benefited from this type of deal, with Nate McLouth last year. However in general I feel that teams don\xe2\x80\x99t serve themselves well by doing this. In the case of Jair Jurrjens the Orioles brought him up to the big leagues only to send him right back down. People might ask why this is such an issue; you just bring the guy up, send him down, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the end of it\xe2\x80\xa6right? Not really. Keep in mind that teams have to leave players in the minors for a minimum of ten days (unless there\xe2\x80\x99s an emergency such as someone going to the DL or the paternity list). So in sending someone down just for the sake of bringing a guy up to fulfill a contract stipulation, you could be losing their services for ten days. For teams such as the Orioles who tend to make lots of roster moves, this might not be too big a problem. However I feel that it also gives the team itself very little wiggle room on players. Then again, I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s how you look at it; the other side would argue that it allows teams to bring players into the organization that they otherwise wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had.In fairness, there are pros and cons to everything. However here\xe2\x80\x99s another interesting point; do these types of contracts make it tougher to work trades for players? Over the weekend it was reported that the Orioles would not call Ishikawa up to the big leagues, but were trying to work out a trade for him. Ishikawa is a decent \xe2\x80\x9cprospect,\xe2\x80\x9d although he has spent time in the big leagues both with Milwaukee and San Francisco. However if you were another team looking for a backup infielder or perhaps farm system depth, would you make a deal for a guy that in theory you could get without losing a prospect in a few days? In other words, I suspect that teams are hesitating to make a deal for Ishikawa (and other players like him with opt-out clauses) because they think they can get the same player simply by signing him as a free agent. These kinds of moves of course are akin to playing roulette, however I would think that other organizations have no urge to make deals for guys like this.Ultimately I feel that giving minor league players opt-out clauses gives the team very little wiggle-room in terms of personnel. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing regarding the concept of bringing someone up to satisfy the opt-out clause; if they\xe2\x80\x99re sent back to triple-A they have to be outrighted. That means that the player can refuse the assignment and become a free agent if he clears waivers. So the ball is really in the player\xe2\x80\x99s court big time on these contracts. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost similar to a rule 5 pick in that you have to manage your roster and your team with that player in mind so that you can keep him.

They were. Out of 15 teams, they were literally the worst. There were also some bright spots, like O's first basemen, powered by Chris Davis, being the best in the American League. A month and a day later, it's time to revisit the positional rankings and see whether anything has gotten better or worse. One thing has stayed the same: the Orioles were in second place in the AL East, two games back, when I published the last article. Following last night's loss, they are in second place in the AL East, two games back. A bit of explanation about the chart to follow. These are the rankings by position, not by individual player. Third base is exclusively Manny Machado, because he's played every inning the Orioles have played. First base is mostly Davis, but not exclusively, since he missed a small number of games due to an injury. Right field is mostly Nick Markakis, and so on. Each position is compared against the other teams in the AL at that position, ranked by OPS (on-base percentage plus slugging). Statistics and rankings do not reflect any changes that may have occurred due to Monday's games. The current batting average, OBP, and SLG at each position for the Orioles are also included. Just for fun, I've thrown in the +/- change for each position's OPS compared to a month ago. Whole team is N/A for +/- because I didn't think to include it a month ago. I haven't started the chart yet as I type this paragraph. I hope it doesn't turn out to be depressing.      Position AVG OBP SLG +/- OPS OPS Rank (AL)   DH .193 .260 .387 +.159 13   C .224 .283 .376 -(.049) 12   1B .340 .419 .699 +.037 1   2B .210 .268 .292 +.030 15   3B .327 .358 .495 -(.066) 5   SS .264 .307 .461 +.113 2   LF .283 .360 .420 -(.036) 3   CF .303 .327 .520 +.021 2   RF .306 .345 .433 +.012 5   Whole Team .273 .325 .453 N/A 2      In all, the O's have the second-best OPS in the AL, with six of the nine positions being above average, four of which are third or better. There is a lot of balance, with the whole offense not merely being carried by one position - though first base, led by Davis, is nearly 200 OPS points ahead of the nearest competitor. That wasn't so depressing after all, though the bad parts are evident. Think for a second about how ridiculous Davis was hitting in April and the first half of May, and consider that he has improved on his OPS in the last month.    DH is most improved, but they were so bad before that the significant improvement still leaves them 13th in the AL. On the other hand, the next-most improved position is shortstop, with J.J. Hardy fueling a significant rise. SS was tenth-best a month ago, and Hardy now has the second-best bat by OPS among his AL peers. That is a fantastic improvement from a player I had more or less written off offensively. Right field also improved in OPS and in the peer ranking, going from seventh a month ago to fifth. Just don't tell the people voting for Markakis in the All-Star Game that there's so many better-hitting outfielders out there. Among the positions where the OPS declined, third base and left field are not problematic, because the numbers are still respectable and relative to the peers they did not drop much. Third base was third-best a month ago, and left field was second-best. The decline for catcher is frustrating, because that is now one of the worst bats at that position in the AL, whereas before it was average, at seventh. While Hardy brought up the shortstops, it doesn't seem like Matt Wieters is ever going to do so for the catchers. There's also second base to consider. They are the worst of all AL second basemen, and the unit has the third-worst OPS of all positions in the league, with only Seattle and New York shortstops ranking below O's second basemen. There is no reason to believe there is any hope in sight for this spot, unless you're a close relative of Ryan Flaherty. Could DH keep improving? It is difficult to be as bad as they were. If the conglomeration of Steve Pearce, Chris Dickerson, and Danny Valencia - plus whatever player hits DH to get a rest in the field on a given day - could drag the unit up to a .700 OPS, that would still be pathetic, only 12th-best, but we might feel a little better about it. 71 games into this season, it may be time to confront this frightening realization: the Orioles have a good offense. This is a scary thing to think because you can only lose things that you have. When the Orioles were bad, they were just bad. There was nothing disappointing about it. We didn't get our hopes up. Now we have hopes, in the team, in individual players, and hopes can be crushed. Yet sometimes our wildest dreams are exceeded. The Orioles were good last year, and this year they are still good. Different things make them good, but they are still good, so far. Now, if the starting rotation and half of the bullpen could only get their acts together...

During that time, the Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles meet 19 times, as will every team against each member of its division. That\'s nearly half the schedule against 14% of the 29 other major league teams.Baltimore manager Buck Showalter isn\'t a big fan of the format.YANKEES: Mattingly returns to Bronx""If I were the commissioner, I wouldn\'t last too long,"" Showalter said with a chuckle. ""They do the research. \xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m sure there\'s good reasons (for playing so many division games). It\'s about the fans, what they want. That\'s what we\'re always here for.""Like most intradivision games, American League East matchups are wildly popular among fans and feverishly intense among players. This season, four high-quality teams with a recent \xe2\x80\x94 if not long-term \xe2\x80\x94 history of being competitive are scrapping it out 76 times. Entering this week, the Red Sox, Orioles, New York Yankees and Tampa Bay Rays were within five games of one another and also within at least two of a wild-card playoff spot.The Orioles manager was speaking at the beginning of one of the many series between AL East foes, this one a four-game stint against Boston at Camden Yards that concluded Sunday. Red Sox pitchers hit Orioles batters three times in the first game, but there was no retaliation other than the Orioles winning three of four games.METS: Bobby Parnell growing into closer role Still, it was a hotly contested series, full of close games (three by two runs or fewer) and electricity in the stands. The Red Sox had just arrived from a series at the Tampa Bay Rays in which tension had spilled over and benches cleared.Another result of the unbalanced schedule? Such spats are more likely, Yankees infielder Kevin Youkilis says.""There\'s more bad blood when you play a team 19 times,"" Youkilis said during the same week the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks brawled in the National League West. ""There\'s more bad blood in the stands, too, more fights that happen. ... There wouldn\'t be as many fights if you didn\'t have (as much divisional play). The fans get a little crazy, too.""ANGELS: Hamilton\'s forgettable game one for the booksYoukilis, who played in Boston for nine seasons during what might have been the height of the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry, finds himself in one of the most intense division races in recent memory.The AL East could become the first American League division since 1993 to see its top four teams finish within 10 games of each other during a full season. (That has happened three times in the National League since then.)""Is there a different kind of edge because of the situation, about where you are in the division? Yeah,"" Red Sox outfielder Shane Victorino said.Boston (44-29) has the American League\'s best record but is clinging to a 2 1/2-game lead on Baltimore (41-31). Playing without many of their big-name stars for much of the first half, the Yankees (38-31) are four games back, and the Rays (36-35) are seven out. The Blue Jays (34-36), who started slowly after acquiring several of the Miami Marlins\' top players in the offseason, have won seven in a row and are 8 1/2 games back.SUBSCRIBE : Get USA TODAY Sports Weekly delivered!""I got a true read of how difficult it is to win in this division,"" said Yankees outfielder Vernon Wells, who played with the Blue Jays from 1999 to 2010. ""We had some good teams in Toronto, and there\'s one year when we actually finished second in the division and we were still 10 games behind the Yankees. That just goes to show how dominant New York was at that time. Then Tampa Bay got better, and now Baltimore.""Intensity picks up Before fans pack the seats of Camden Yards, two clubhouses rock with the rhythmic thumping of loud music. In one, Orioles players relax, play pool and eat pregame snacks before making their way to positional meetings and team stretching. In the other, the visiting Red Sox lounge on couches and play games on their phones. In both clubhouses, baseball highlight shows flicker quietly on the TVs mounted around the room, but neither team pays attention.After all, there are a lot more games left. But come September, chances to atone for past shortcomings can become painfully numbered. Last season, the Yankees and Orioles spent most of September within a game of one another before New York finally prevailed.There\'s a chance that the series\' opening game will be postponed by thunderstorms and will have to be made up as a doubleheader at some point. Showalter knows how playing twice in the same day can wreak havoc on a pitching rotation, putting the Orioles and Red Sox at a major disadvantage later in the season, especially if the teams are in the playoff hunt. It is just one game, but it\'s part of a schedule that is difficult to alter.""One of the things that we have going for us right now is that we don\'t have any (doubleheaders) scheduled,"" Showalter said.The tarp covering the infield is eventually removed, and those who have braved the ominous conditions file in. Many wear red and start chants of ""Let\'s go Red Sox."" The rest retaliate with boos. It\'s a division game, a rivalry by default, and it\'s treated like one. Every inning-ending out is greeted with a standing ovation, and any call against the Orioles is taken as a personal insult.Though dark clouds hint at more rain, it holds off as Boston scores two late runs to force extra innings. With runners on first and second and two outs in the bottom of the 13th, Chris Davis \xe2\x80\x94 the major league leader in home runs \xe2\x80\x94 hits a blooper over the shortstop. Left fielder Jonny Gomes is playing too deep, the ball drops in and the Orioles celebrate a 5-4 win after 4 1/2 hours of baseball.Boston\'s current first-place standing is much the result of hot bats that rarely seem to cool down. Boston had five players with at least 34 runs and six with at least eight home runs, not to mention the major league stolen-base leader (outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury, 31). In Baltimore, third baseman Manny Machado recently became the youngest player in Orioles history to hit 30 doubles in a season, and it\'s still June. The third baseman led the majors in that category by nearly double digits in helping the Orioles produce the AL\'s second-most runs, trailing Boston. The Rays, Blue Jays and Yankees also were in the top 10.In recent seasons, the AL East also has had a reputation for tenacious starting pitching. It\'s a division in which teams load up on or grow elite starters in an effort to neutralize the big bats.Some of the division\'s top arms might be hurt (Boston\'s Clay Buchholz), having down years (New York\'s CC Sabathia and Toronto\'s Mark Buehrle and R.A. Dickey) or both (Tampa Bay\'s David Price), but the potential to face a current or ex-ace is there nearly every night.""You\'re always up for competition,"" Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner said. ""You face guys like Roy Halladay (who pitched for the Blue Jays from 1998 to 2009) and Clay Buchholz. When Halladay was with the Blue Jays, it seemed like he faced us twice in a three-game series almost. He always pitched against us. And guys like (former Rays ace James) Shields and Price and Matt Moore, and (the Red Sox\'s Jon) Lester, and John Lackey\'s having a good year. It\'s like it doesn\'t ever let up.""Before arriving in Baltimore, the Red Sox were coming off a series against Tampa Bay in which benches cleared after Lackey hit Matt Joyce in the back. The Rays outfielder had homered in the first inning and flipped his bat after crushing a foul ball in the second inning. Joyce called Lackey\'s move bush league, and Rays manager Joe Maddon said Lackey\'s actions in that instance made him a bad teammate because he could have been ejected.The next day, Maddon didn\'t back away from his harsh words, but he also talked of admiration and mutual respect between division rivals.""I really have a lot of respect for that group in regards of how they play and who they are,"" Maddon said of the Red Sox, according to the Tampa Bay Times.Victorino agreed that the spat didn\'t come at the expense of civility. The Red Sox outfielder is getting his first real taste of the AL East after spending most of his nine-season big-league career with the Philadelphia Phillies.""That\'s what you live for, the kinds of games you play for,"" he said. ""Any given night, those five teams can go out there and beat up on each other.""\xc2\xa0(Photo: Steven Bisig, USA TODAY Sports)Parity is growingThere\'s an out-of-town scoreboard in right field at Camden Yards, and it flashes Yankees and Rays losses alongside results from around baseball. That alone draws soft cheers from the crowd \xe2\x80\x94 both the Baltimore and Boston fans happy with their rivals\' suffering. The players won\'t admit to paying attention to other teams\' results. But when the Orioles survive to win the opener vs. the Red Sox and make their way back to the clubhouse, some players turn right to the TVs. Before they see the score of the Yankees-Oakland Athletics game, players overhear that New York\'s game had gone 18 innings.""Oh, that\'s good. Did they win?"" pitcher Tommy Hunter asked.They hadn\'t. The Yankees jumped to a first-inning lead but couldn\'t score for the rest of the game. And after burning through its bullpen, New York called upon closer Mariano Rivera, who surrendered the game-winning hit.""There you go,"" Hunter said. ""We\'re not scoreboard-watching, but you pay attention to things every once in a while. You see when things happen.""Over the past 15 years, there has rarely been a runaway winner of the AL East. Since 1998, when the Yankees won by 22 games, the division champion has won by more than 10 twice, in 2001 and 2002. The winner has won by five or fewer games nine times.And then there\'s the recent parity. From 1998 to 2007, the Yankees (nine titles) or the Red Sox (one) won the division. But since then, the Rays have won it twice and the Orioles have emerged as bona fide contenders.""Our division is so competitive, and especially guys that have been around for a couple of years, they\'ve seen it come down to the wire every year, the last couple of days of the season,"" Gardner said. ""Three years ago (when the Rays beat the Yankees by a game), it came down to the last out. So guys are aware of how important every game is, especially against teams in your division.""Youkilis recommends moving to two 15-team leagues and a format in which the top five teams in each advance to the playoffs. Five teams make the postseason, but he says eliminating divisions would ensure that the best teams get in.""I have a hard time if the third-place AL East team has the same record as somebody in another division (that gets the playoff spot instead),"" he said.As of now, the five AL East teams are fighting for three playoff spots, and there is much incentive for winning the division and avoiding a winner-take-all wild-card game.""You show up to spring training and say, \'I want to play in the World Series. I want to play in the postseason,\'"" Victorino said. ""You have to show up every day. You can\'t take a little sabbatical this week or anything like that.""Especially not in this division.Contributing: Jorge L.

He\'s not only hitting for average but he\'s hitting for power and he\'s driving in runs.""STATS: Major league home run leadersDavis\' home run total is the only thing currently standing in the way of a second consecutive AL Triple Crown for Cabrera. The Tigers third baseman leads the league in batting average at .361 and RBI with 71.Baseball fans could be in for an MVP debate similar to the one last year with Cabrera dominating the traditional hitting categories and leading his team to a division title on one hand \xe2\x80\xa6 and an upstart challenger putting up a combination of statistics that no one in history has ever matched on the other.He doesn\'t have Mike Trout\'s power/speed combination, but if Davis continues at his current pace, he\'ll finish with 51 doubles, 58 home runs and 146 RBI. Indeed, no player in baseball history has ever gone 50/50/140 in a single season.(Todd Helton came the closest with 54 doubles, 49 homers and 146 RBI in 2001. Albert Belle just missed twice \xe2\x80\x93 52/50/126 in 1995 and 48/49/152 in 1998.)Davis, 27, has blossomed into one of the game\'s top power hitters after finally becoming a major league regular just last season. Acquired by the Orioles from the Texas Rangers at the 2011 trade deadline, he hit 33 homers and drove in 85 runs in 139 games last season splitting time at first base, DH and the outfield.Taking over as the regular first baseman this season, he is drawing more walks and \xe2\x80\x93 more importantly \xe2\x80\x93 cutting down on the strikeouts that made him prone to slumps in the past.""I think he\'s definitely made himself into a star,"" says Tigers outfielder Torii Hunter. ""Some guys just have to figure it out. After two or three years in the big leagues, some guys either fold or they step up to the plate. With Chris Davis, he\'s definitely stepped up to the plate.""With Davis paving the way, the Orioles lead the majors in slugging percentage (.451 entering Wednesday\'s games). And after taking two of three in Detroit, the second-place O\'s now have a better record (42-31) than the first-place Tigers (39-31).It may be time to start getting those MVP talking points in order.Contributing: George Sipple, Detroit Free PressCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com')]"
06/20/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Orange crush - Birds Watcher', 'If you watch certain networks and channels exclusively, you might not know who Chris Davis is. However if you live in and around Baltimore and/or you\xe2\x80\x99re a Baltimore Orioles fan, he\xe2\x80\x99s a man that needs no introduction. Many people said going into the season that the Birds\xc2\xa0might\xc2\xa0have the chance to have a decent season if Davis could replicate his production of 2012 when he hit a career-high 34 home runs. In yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s win over Detroit, Davis his #25 and 26 respectively. Needless to say, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to far outdo his 2012 self.Courtesy of Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsChris Tillman ran his record to 8-2 on the season in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s win, although he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the dominant stuff that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in several past starts. But let\xe2\x80\x99s not kid ourselves into thinking that Tillman wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pretty good; tab this as an \xe2\x80\x9cin-between\xe2\x80\x9d start. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 7 H, 3 R, 3 BB, 1 K. Tillman danced in and out of trouble several times during the course of his outing, however when you get the offensive support behind you that he got yesterday that isn\xe2\x80\x99t really a worry. Tillman and Detroit starter Rick Porcello appeared destined for a pitchers duel through three innings, and then we hit the last of the fourth. With one on and one out Davis gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 2-0 lead with a monster shot to left field. Taylor Teagarden followed that up with a three-run homer of his own, and suddenly the Orioles led what used to be a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s duel 5-0. Add on a Machado RBI-single before the inning ended, and that stretched to 6-0.Tillman allowed one run on an RBI-double in the fourth, and then two more in the sixth after Buck Showalter lifted him. However this had the mark of a true AL East game in that the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite feel like they ever wanted to stop scoring. In their three-run seventh inning the Orioles produced a double-steal and a Chris Davis RBI-double which ended up putting three on the board to run the lead to 9-3. Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 two-RBI double in the ninth ran it to 11-3, and the coup de grace from Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s perspective was Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 second homer of the day to score Jones and cap off the scoring with the Orioles leading 13-3. Incidentally, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that second home run has landed yet.One thing I found interesting was that Buck Showalter brought in Freddy Garcia to pitch the last of the ninth. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if Garcia needed to throw his normal bullpen session and they decided to do it during a game or what, however the fact is that he did it. Pedro Strop also pitched the last of the eighth, and retired Detroit 1-2-3. As I said, inserting Garcia into the game might well have been akin to him throwing a bullpen side session. However his next turn in the rotation was supposed to be Sunday in Toronto. Miguel Gonzalez and Jason Hammel were supposed to start on Friday and/or Saturday respectively, and then Garcia Sunday. All three games are listed with TBD as the starter. Is it possible that Garcia might get optioned back to the minors when Miguel Gonzalez comes back form paternity leave? One way or the other, Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the game probably saved the Orioles from having to use another reliever.As for Davis, his 26 homers leads the majors. There are quite a few media members and fans alike that are questioning the honesty of Davis\xe2\x80\x99 numbers in terms of PED\xe2\x80\x99s. It\xe2\x80\x99s not unthinkable that any player could be using something along those lines. However I\xe2\x80\x99ll simply say that in the absence of a positive test or a flat admission, fans need to assume that Davis is not cheating. Reportedly he\xe2\x80\x99s been tested three times already this season at least, testing negative each time. But needless to say the O\xe2\x80\x99s have a bat in the middle of the order who people now fear, and they\xe2\x80\x99re having to make special plans just for facing Davis. The Birds are off today before they open up a three-game series with Toronto at Rogers Centre this weekend tomorrow night.\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Playing without many of their big-name stars for much of the first half, the Yankees (39-33) were 3 1/2 games back, and the Rays (38-35) were five out. The Blue Jays (35-36), who started slowly after acquiring several of the Miami Marlins\' top players in the offseason, had won eight in a row and were seven games back.""I got a true read of how difficult it is to win in this division,"" said Yankees outfielder Vernon Wells, who played with the Blue Jays from 1999 to 2010. ""We had some good teams in Toronto, and there\'s one year when we actually finished second in the division and we were still 10 games behind the Yankees. That just goes to show how dominant New York was at that time. Then Tampa Bay got better, and now Baltimore.""***Intensity picks up Before fans pack the seats of Camden Yards,  two clubhouses rock with the rhythmic thumping of loud music. In one, Orioles players relax, play pool and eat pregame snacks before making their way to positional meetings and team stretching. In the other, the visiting Red Sox lounge on couches and play games on their phones. In both clubhouses, baseball highlight shows flicker quietly on the TVs mounted around the room, but neither team pays attention.After all, there are a lot more games left. But come September, chances to atone for past shortcomings can become painfully numbered. Last season, the Yankees and Orioles spent most of September within a game of one another before New York finally prevailed.There\'s a chance that the series\' opening game will be postponed by thunderstorms and will have to be made up as a doubleheader at some point. Showalter knows how playing twice in the same day can wreak havoc on a pitching rotation, putting the Orioles and Red Sox at a major disadvantage later in the season, especially if the teams are in the playoff hunt. It is just one game, but it\'s part of a schedule that is difficult to alter.""One of the things that we have going for us right now is that we don\'t have any (doubleheaders) scheduled,"" Showalter said.The tarp covering the infield is eventually removed, and those who have braved the ominous conditions file in. Many wear red and start chants of ""Let\'s go Red Sox."" The rest retaliate with boos. It\'s a division game, a rivalry by default, and it\'s treated like one. Every inning-ending out is greeted with a standing ovation, and any call against the Orioles is taken as a personal insult.Though dark clouds hint at more rain, it holds off as Boston scores two late runs to force extra innings.  With runners on first and second and two outs in the bottom of the 13th, Chris Davis \xe2\x80\x94 the major league leader in home runs \xe2\x80\x94 hits a blooper over the shortstop. Left fielder Jonny Gomes is playing too deep, the ball drops in and the Orioles celebrate a 5-4 win after 4 1/2 hours of baseball.Boston\'s current first-place standing is much the result of hot bats that rarely seem to cool down. Boston had five players with at least 34 runs and six with at least eight home runs, not to mention the major league stolen-base leader (outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury, 31). In Baltimore, third baseman Manny Machado recently became the youngest player in Orioles history to hit 30 doubles in a season, and it\'s still June. The third baseman led the majors in that category by nearly double digits in helping the Orioles produce the AL\'s second-most runs, trailing Boston. The Rays, Blue Jays and Yankees also were in the top 10.In recent seasons, the AL East also has had a reputation for tenacious starting pitching. It\'s a division in which teams load up on or grow elite starters in an effort to neutralize the big bats.Some of the division\'s top arms might be hurt (Boston\'s Clay Buchholz), having down years (New York\'s CC Sabathia and Toronto\'s Mark Buehrle and R.A. Dickey) or both (Tampa Bay\'s David Price), but the potential to face a current or ex-ace is there nearly every night.""You\'re always up for competition,"" Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner said. ""You face guys like Roy Halladay (who pitched for the Blue Jays from 1998 to 2009) and Clay Buchholz. When Halladay was with the Blue Jays, it seemed like he faced us twice in a three-game series almost. He always pitched against us. And guys like (former Rays ace James) Shields and Price and Matt Moore, and (the Red Sox\'s Jon) Lester, and John Lackey\'s having a good year. It\'s like it doesn\'t ever let up.""Before arriving in Baltimore, the Red Sox were coming off a series against Tampa Bay in which benches cleared after Lackey hit Matt Joyce in the back. The Rays outfielder had homered in the first inning and flipped his bat after crushing a foul ball in the second inning. Joyce called Lackey\'s move bush league, and Rays manager Joe Maddon said Lackey\'s actions in that instance made him a bad teammate because he could have been ejected.The next day, Maddon didn\'t back away from his harsh words, but he also talked of admiration and mutual respect between division rivals.""I really have a lot of respect for that group in regards of how they play and who they are,"" Maddon said of the Red Sox, according to the Tampa BayTimes.Victorino agreed that the spat didn\'t come at the expense of civility. The Red Sox outfielder is getting his first real taste of the AL East after spending most of his nine-season big-league career with the Philadelphia Phillies.""That\'s what you live for, the kinds of games you play for,"" he said. ""Any given night, those five teams can go out there and beat up on each other.""***Parity is growingThere\'s an out-of-town scoreboard in right field at Camden Yards, and it flashes Yankees and Rays losses alongside results from around baseball. That alone draws soft cheers from the crowd \xe2\x80\x94 both the Baltimore and Boston fans happy with their rivals\' suffering. The players won\'t admit to paying attention to other teams\' results. But when the Orioles survive to win the opener vs. the Red Sox and make their way back to the clubhouse, some players turn right to the TVs. Before they see the score of the Yankees-Oakland Athletics game, players overhear that New York\'s game had gone 18 innings.""Oh, that\'s good. Did they win?"" pitcher Tommy Hunter asked.They hadn\'t. The Yankees jumped to a first-inning lead but couldn\'t score for the rest of the game. And after burning through its bullpen, New York called upon closer Mariano Rivera, who surrendered the game-winning hit.""There you go,"" Hunter said. ""We\'re not scoreboard-watching, but you pay attention to things every once in a while. You see when things happen.""Over the past 15 years, there has rarely been a runaway winner of the AL East. Since 1998, when the Yankees won by 22 games, the division champion has won by more than 10 twice, in 2001 and 2002. The winner has won by five or fewer games nine times.And then there\'s the recent parity. From 1998 to 2007, the Yankees (nine titles) or the Red Sox (one) won the division. But since then, the Rays have won it twice and the Orioles have emerged as bona fide contenders.""Our division is so competitive, and especially guys that have been around for a couple of years, they\'ve seen it come down to the wire every year, the last couple of days of the season,"" Gardner said. ""Three years ago (when the Rays beat the Yankees by a game), it came down to the last out. So guys are aware of how important every game is, especially against teams in your division.""Youkilis recommends moving to two 15-team leagues and a format in which the top five teams in each advance to the playoffs. Five teams make the postseason, but he says eliminating divisions would ensure that the best teams get in.""I have a hard time if the third-place AL East team has the same record as somebody in another division (that gets the playoff spot instead),"" he said.As of now, the five AL East teams are fighting for three playoff spots, and there is much incentive for winning the division and avoiding a winner-take-all wild-card game.""You show up to spring training and say, \'I want to play in the World Series. I want to play in the postseason,\'"" Victorino said. ""You have to show up every day. You can\'t take a little sabbatical this week or anything like that.""Especially not in this division.Contributing: Jorge L.

I believe any O\xe2\x80\x99s fan that is at all tuned in would expect that this analysis would yield a rather positive report, and it does \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps even more than would be imagined. However, there are a couple of terribly glaring holes as well.Rather than discuss this with an around-the-horn and then across-the-outfield method, let me do so by a comparative best-to-worst scenario.So there is no secret as to what will be the first position listed \xe2\x80\xa6Jun 21, 2013; Toronto, ON, Canada; Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter (26) argues with home plate umpire Angel Hernandez (55) against the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre. Mandatory Credit: Tom Szczerbowski-USA TODAY SportsFirst Base \xe2\x80\x93 Of course, Chris Davis has played almost every game this year at first base for the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 though he did DH just this past Wednesday and hit two homers in that role. So the first base stats for the Orioles top the AL in just about every statistical category \xe2\x80\x93 with a batting average of .335, HRs at 24, and RBIs at 62 (though Toronto/Encarnacion has 59).Center Field \xe2\x80\x93 Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 15 of the 16 O\xe2\x80\x99s homers from this position leads the league. The fantastic stats of Mike Trout put the Angels in the top spot with a .333 average, while the Orioles are second at .303.Short Stop \xe2\x80\x93 The value of J.J. Hardy is especially seen when his numbers are stacked against the average stats for short stops. The .270 average for the Orioles is well above the league average of .249.\xc2\xa0 But, the 15 homers are more than twice what any other team has gotten from the position. And of course, this does not even factor the gold glove defensive consistency.Third Base \xe2\x80\x93 In an amazing change from this time last year, only the Tigers have better stats at third base, and we all understand that the main guy over there is not normal. Of course, Manny Machado has played every inning at third, and his .327 is second only to the crazy .357 in Detroit. With only five homers, that trails the league average of nine, but the doubles and everything else on offence and defense more than make up for it.Right Field \xe2\x80\x93 The O\xe2\x80\x99s .305 batting average from right field is tops in the league, with the Tigers second at .292 (and a league median of only .256).\xc2\xa0 Also at the top is the benefit of Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 plate discipline with an OBP of .359.Left Field \xe2\x80\x93 The combined O\xe2\x80\x99s batting average of .287 at this position places them second in the AL to that of the Royals. Nate McCloth\xe2\x80\x99s skills do contribute to the team being the best in runs scored at 52 and OBP at .363 (with an OPS of .792 is 2nd only to Tampa Bay). An amazing statistic is that the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 24 stolen bases is four times higher than the next teams on the list who can only boast six!All of these first six summaries are really, really impressive! But here is where it flattens out like a fastball with no movement, and then it drops off the table like a crisp slider\xe2\x80\xa6Catcher \xe2\x80\x93 Orioles catchers are tied for 11th in the league in batting at .221, whereas the league average is .245 \xe2\x80\xa6 however, the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 catchers have the most RBIs at 39.\xc2\xa0 Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 .236 average and less than expected overall offensive production is beginning to draw more and more comment from fans and even some writers. His defensive strengths \xe2\x80\x93 where he is arguably the best in the sport \xe2\x80\x93 go a long way toward mitigating these disappointments, yet this does seem to me to be a legitimate growing concern relative to long-term contract negotiations.Second Base \xe2\x80\x93 Oh my! The Orioles combined average of .217 is the worst by far, while the league average is .269. \xc2\xa0Ryan Flaherty has been among the very best in the field, but this is clearly a hole in the lineup. \xc2\xa0A big, big question looking forward to the second half of the season will be the viability of Brian Roberts as a solution. I feel now that about half of my sports-writing life has had this as an ongoing topic.Designated Hitter \xe2\x80\x93 Oh my again! The Orioles have a combined league-worst DH batting average of .195.\xc2\xa0 Compare that to Boston\xe2\x80\x99s .313!\xc2\xa0 The Birds are 13th in the AL in RBIs with just 32 from the DH. However, they do rank third in homers with 13.\xc2\xa0 Again, rehearsing an old topic, the Orioles could really, really use a healthy Nolan Reimold.Summary/Conclusion \xe2\x80\x93 The statistics largely prove what we already know. The Orioles can put together a very powerful offensive team. The couple of holes are well-known to us all, hence the hopes that solutions from R&R (no, not rest and relaxation) could make the team simply an incredible force. Of course, that also assumes the top six to seven guys above are also able to stay healthy and maintain the basic production displayed so far.And then there is the comparative issue of Orioles starters and relievers, but that is a topic for another day.

Toronto had 11-game winning streaks in 1987 and 1998.""It\'s been a great run and hopefully we can continue,"" Bautista said.The Blue Jays (37-36) are above .500 for the first time since last July 29, when they were 51-50.Bautista traded angry words with O\'Day after striking out to end the seventh inning Friday, stranding a runner at second base.On Saturday, the Blue Jays slugger renewed the argument, yelling at O\'Day while rounding the bases after his pivotal home run.""I told him just to keep talking like he was yesterday because he kind of ran his mouth a little bit after he struck me out,"" Bautista said. ""I don\'t know where that came from but I didn\'t appreciate it. I let him know that yesterday and that\'s a little reminder today.""O\'Day declined to talk about his spat with Bautista, while Orioles manager Buck Showalter chalked it up to a clash of competitive personalities.""Darren is a competitor, he likes to compete in those situations,"" Showalter said. ""Sometimes he wins, sometimes Bautista wins. You\'ve got two great, talented athletes competing out there and they both take it personally.""The Blue Jays led 2-1 heading into the eighth but Taylor Teagarden tied it with a homer off reliever Darren Oliver.Orioles starter Miguel Gonzalez left after Munenori Kawasaki hit a one-out single in the bottom half. O\'Day came on and got Rajai Davis to ground into a fielder\'s choice, but Bautista followed with a two-out homer just inside the left-field foul pole on a 3-2 pitch.""I made a terrible pitch,"" O\'Day said. ""If I make a good pitch, he\'s probably out.""Bautista, who homered for the 16th time this season, said he wasn\'t sure his drive was going to stay fair.""I had no idea it was going to go out, either,"" Bautista said. ""I knew I hit it well but I didn\'t know if it had enough.""The homer was the first allowed by O\'Day since May 22, when Yankees infielder David Adams took him deep.Oliver (3-1) worked one inning and Casey Janssen finished for his 17th save in 18 chances.Gonzalez (5-3) allowed three runs and three hits in 7 1-3 innings. The right-hander, who won his previous three starts, lost for the first time since May 3 at the Los Angeles Angels.""He was outstanding today,"" Showalter said. ""He pitched really well. I was really proud of him.""It\'s been a busy week for Gonzalez, who left the team Monday for the birth of his first child, a daughter, and was activated off the paternity list Friday.""I was supposed to throw a bullpen three days ago but it didn\'t happen,"" Gonzalez said. ""I was back home with the family.""The Blue Jays opened the scoring in the first when Melky Cabrera drew a leadoff walk, advanced to third on Adam Lind\'s two-out single and scored on a wild pitch.The Orioles tied it in the fifth after Chris Davis reached on second baseman Emilio Bonifacio\'s error. He went to second on a grounder and scored on Travis Ishikawa\'s single.Izturis put the Blue Jays back in front by homering on the first pitch of the fifth.Baltimore left the potential tying run stranded at third base in the seventh but knotted it at 2 in the eighth on Teagarden\'s one-out homer.Blue Jays starter Chien-Ming Wang left to a standing ovation after giving up one run and five hits in 6 1-3 innings. The right-hander, who walked none and struck out two, has a 2.61 ERA in three starts with Toronto.""That\'s three really good ones,"" manager John Gibbons said. ""He shut down a good hitting team. I know he feels good, he\'s a part of it now. He\'s given us a big boost, that\'s for sure.""NOTES: Bautista is one home run away from 200 for his career. ... Blue Jays RHP Kyle Drabek (elbow surgery) is set to begin a minor league rehabilitation assignment with Class-A Dunedin on Saturday. ... Orioles C Matt Wieters got the day off, while Chris Davis started at DH. He doubled and scored a run, but struck out to end the game. ... Baltimore RHP Freddy Garcia is expected to start Sunday\'s series finale against RHP Josh Johnson, meaning LHP Zach Britton will start for the Orioles against Cleveland on Monday.

In 2011, O\xe2\x80\x99s telecasts on MASN ranked 18th in ratings among the teams in Major League Baseball. So far this season, they rank fifth, and have had an 86 percent jump in ratings since 2011.Those numbers represent not only interest from fans, but also good business news for MASN, the regional sports network broadcasting Orioles and Washington Nationals games, and its advertisers.\xe2\x80\x9cEven through the lean years, O\xe2\x80\x99s viewership was always respectable. But you could really begin to see the groundswell of support building steadily last season, and it has just kept growing,\xe2\x80\x9d MASN senior vice president John McGuinness said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would not be surprised to see our audience grow another 10 to 15 percent from now until the end of this season.\xe2\x80\x9d var adSkipCounter = 0; It\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual for winning teams (and regional sports networks) to see ratings grow in summer, when traditional network programming moves to reruns. But in Baltimore, Orioles telecasts were No. 1 during the pull-out-all-the-stops May sweeps period with viewers 18 to 34 and 18 to 49 years old, the demographics most favored by advertisers. Among sports media analysts contacted for this article, none could name a similar instance this season in any other city.The obvious explanation is the kind of winning baseball the Orioles are playing. Last year, they appeared in the postseason for the first time since 1997; this year, they are in second place behind the Boston Red Sox.Andrew Stetka has long been a fan of O\xe2\x80\x99s baseball on TV, but this year he finds himself \xe2\x80\x9cwatching every game.\xe2\x80\x9d And he rates the experience \xe2\x80\x9coutstanding,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to the leadership of manager Buck Showalter.\xe2\x80\x9cSince Showalter has taken over the team, there\xe2\x80\x99s a different feel, a different swagger. It makes the fans believe they can beat anyone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.But advertisers and ad agency buyers say there\xe2\x80\x99s more to the TV success than that.They like the team\xe2\x80\x99s overall youth and the sense of optimism it generates \xe2\x80\x94 saying they believe viewers come to associate those positive attributes with their products. And they love the nail-biting, comeback wins that keep viewers tuned in for nine innings of action \xe2\x80\x94 and commercials.\xe2\x80\x9cI think the feeling of this team is very optimistic and exciting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Barry Tate, executive vice president of Tate Dodge Chrysler Jeep. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if they\xe2\x80\x99re exciting on the field, then people will get excited about whatever you put on with that team as well.\xe2\x80\x9dKevin Kempske, partner in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s GKV advertising agency, which places several of its clients on MASN, added, \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re winning games in the bottom of the ninth or the bottom of the eighth, or the top of the 10th if they\xe2\x80\x99re on the road. Whatever it is, they just don\xe2\x80\x99t give up. And as a result, viewers are watching from inning one through inning nine, as opposed to just watching the first few innings, turning it off and putting something else on if the Orioles look like they\xe2\x80\x99re not in the game.\xe2\x80\x9dMASN wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t release booking data or commercial rates, but inventory appears to be tightening. As a buyer, Kempske sees the improved ratings already translating into advertising dollars for MASN.\xe2\x80\x9cWe did notice an average rate increase, year over year, for the O\xe2\x80\x99s telecast,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have also noticed a tightening in the supply of spots available. More marketers are \xe2\x80\x98getting into the game,\xe2\x80\x99 which is selling out the inventory.\xe2\x80\x9dThe O\xe2\x80\x99s fervor extends to more pageviews for sports media and rising ratings for WBAL Radio during its Orioles broadcasts.\xe2\x80\x9cLast year there was rapid improvement in the ratings, and they continue to rise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dave Hill, program director for the station.Though TV ratings have grown in all segments, they are most marked among younger viewers. Advertisers point to the persona that the team\xe2\x80\x99s young stars \xe2\x80\x94 centerfielder Adam Jones, first baseman Chris Davis and third baseman Manny Machado \xe2\x80\x94 has developed not only on the field, but also in the community and social media.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re doing a promotion this year with Adam Jones, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s indicative of the kind of thing that makes advertising with the team attractive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mike Sullivan, spokesman for CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

', 'articles.baltimoresun.com'), ('Orioles lose Showalter and the game - A Baltimore Orioles ...', 'You can add Buck Showalter to the lengthy list of managers and players who have now had a problem with umpire Angel Hernandez. With the Baltimore Orioles trailing Toronto 2-0 in the top of the second, Chris Davis appeared to swing-and-miss at strike three for the first out. However the ball trickled away from the catcher Thole, and Davis began to run to first base\xe2\x80\xa6until Hernandez put his hands up to indicate a foul ball. Toronto manager John Gibbons argued that the ball had never hit Davis\xe2\x80\x99 bat, and MASN replays seemed to back that fact up. After conferring with the other umpires, Hernandez called Davis out. Buck Showalter came out to argue his point, and was incensed with Hernandez to the point of being thrown out of the game.Courtesy of Tom Szczerbowski-USA TODAY SportsShowalter complained vehemently for several minutes before being ejected. So why the argument if in fact the call was correct? While in general players and coaches want umpires to ask their associates for help on close calls, is it not fair to point out that the other umpires would have no clue if the batter actually foul tipped it or not? Furthermore, Davis in effect stopped his run to first base when Hernandez called it a foul ball. In that situation he still needs to be put out, and he never got that courtesy in that case. Ultimately the call was correct (Davis struck out), however the situation was very poorly handled by Angel Hernandez. And thus you could make the argument that he should have left if as a foul ball so as to give Davis the benefit of the doubt since he stopped running after Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s foul ball signal.However the good news for the O\xe2\x80\x99s was that they pulled to within one run in short order on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s solo homer. Starter Jason Hammel then proceeded to go into a zone in which he shut Toronto down for quite some time. Hammel\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 4 H, 4 R, 1 BB, 7 K. The four runs obviously prevent him from getting a quality start, however Hammel was pretty solid for much of the time he was in the game (following an Adam Lind first inning home run). Toronto would put up another run to run the score to 3-1, however the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 four-run sixth inning quickly took care of that. Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-single brought the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within 3-2, which was followed by Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 three-run home run (27th of the season). Yes folks, the guy can also crush knuckleballs!After the teams swapped home runs (including one by Ryan Flaherty), Tommy Hunter relieved Hammel in the seventh, and Kawasaki tied the game at six with a two-run shot. That was the key play in the game, as the Orioles had taken control to that point. They\xe2\x80\x99re playing a team in Toronto who\xe2\x80\x99s very similar to the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the sense that they really believe that they\xe2\x80\x99re never out of games. Furthermore while they took three-of-four in the last series, the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t play well in Toronto. A lot of people don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear that, but the fact is that there are certain places where you don\xe2\x80\x99t play well. Perhaps more importantly, Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s won nine games in a row which goes back to the confidence aspect on their side as well.Toronto ended up winning the game in the last of the ninth after Kawasaki sacrificed two runners into scoring position with two outs, and Rajai Davis hit an RBI-single to center. Acting manager John Russel had just brought in Pedro Strop to pitch to Davis, although you have to wonder if Russel didn\xe2\x80\x99t outsmart himself in a sense by lifting Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day. This is not to say that O\xe2\x80\x99Day should have faced Davis, however Orioles fans know the result of Strop pitching in the game in that situation; they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what would have happened had O\xe2\x80\x99Day stayed in the game. But in fairness to Russel, hindsight is 20/20.One concern coming out of this game is that Buck Showalter might in fact be facing disciplinary action from the league if they deem that his actions showed up Angel Hernandez in any way. Managers or players won\xe2\x80\x99t generally be suspended for just a run-of-the-mill ejection; however the league reviews all ejections and if they deem that the player/coach argued beyond reason after being tossed, they might tack on a suspension or fine. Having said that, the league would also have no choice but to say that the situation was mis-handled by Angel Hernandez as well. Ultimately as I said above, the original call should have probably stood since Davis stopped due to Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s call. You have to overcome bad calls in sports, but the fact that Hardy homered in the next at-bat and that the Orioles ended up losing by one is tough to overlook.The Orioles will be back in action in Toronto this afternoon just after 1 PM as Miguel Gonzalez will make his first start since becoming a father this past week. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Chien-Ming Wang. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

They\'ve won 15 of their past 18, outscoring their opponents 102-52 in that span.""I\'ve been waiting for this since the season started,"" Encarnacion said. ""I believe in this team so I knew things had to change, things had to become good for us. That\'s the way right now and we enjoy it, enjoy the moment. I\'m not surprised by this. I know this team is good and I know we can do it.""Toronto has swept three consecutive series for the first time since 1998, the last time they won 11 straight. The Blue Jays also won 11 consecutive games in 1987.""Everybody is doing their job, everybody is pitching in,"" Johnson said. ""It\'s been impressive.""Playing before a sellout crowd of 45,214, Toronto became the first team since Detroit in 2011 to win 11 straight.""We\'re feeling pretty good about ourselves,"" Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. ""We shut down a really good team over there.""The Blue Jays, who begin a three-game series at Tampa Bay on Monday, have not lost since a 10-6 defeat at the Chicago White Sox on June 10.""A lot of guys have been in a good rhythm at the same time, which is kind of what we didn\'t have to start the season,"" catcher J.P. Arencibia said.Ryan Flaherty hit two homers but Baltimore lost for the fifth time in eight games and allowed a season high in runs.""We ran into a good team and came up short,"" Flaherty said.Johnson (1-2) was winless in his first seven starts with Toronto, receiving just 13 total runs of support and losing twice. That changed Sunday, as the Blue Jays helped the right-hander with an early offensive barrage, scoring nine times in the first three innings.Johnson allowed four runs and seven hits in six-plus innings, walked one and struck out five. He\'s 1-1 with a 2.84 ERA in four starts since missing 31 games with a right triceps injury, and has struck out 25 batters in his past 25 1-3 innings.""It\'s not an easy lineup to face regardless of the score,"" Gibbons said. ""That\'s another good outing for him. That\'s one win. Getting on the board so you\'ve got something to show for it always makes you feel good.""Aaron Loup, Juan Perez and Dustin McGowan each worked one inning.Flaherty hit a two-run shot off Johnson in the seventh and a solo homer off McGowan in the ninth for his first career multihomer game. He has five home runs this season.With first base open, the Blue Jays intentionally walked Orioles slugger Chris Davis to load the bases for Matt Wieters in the first, but Johnson got Wieters to foul out.""Every time you turn on the highlights he\'s doing some damage somewhere,"" Gibbons said of Davis. ""We\'ve seen plenty of that. That\'s key, getting out of that first inning without any runs.""Arencibia was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded in the bottom half to drive in the game\'s first run.The Blue Jays used small ball and the long ball to score three more in the second. Emilio Bonifacio led off with a bunt single over the head of Baltimore starter Freddy Garcia, stole second and went to third on a sacrifice bunt before scoring on Melky Cabrera\'s sacrifice fly. Jose Bautista walked and Encarnacion followed with a first-pitch homer to left.Toronto blew it open with a five-run, bat-around third. Maicer Izturis and Bonifacio chased Garcia with back-to-back RBI doubles, bringing left-hander T.J. McFarland out of the bullpen. One out later, Cabrera singled home a run, Bautista walked and Encarnacion hit a two-run double.Baltimore broke through against Johnson in the fifth, when Manny Machado led off with his ML-leading 34th double and scored on a double by Nick Markakis. Markakis went to third on Adam Jones\' grounder and scored when Davis reached on Bonifacio\'s fielding error. Davis was credited with an RBI.Flaherty\'s two-run homer made it 9-4 but Toronto answered with four in the bottom half. Colby Rasmus led off with a homer against McFarland, his 14th, and Bautista hit a bases-loaded double off Pedro Strop.Garcia (3-5) had won his previous two outings in Toronto but lost for the third time in four starts. He allowed a season-worst seven runs and seven hits in 2 1-3 innings, his shortest start of the year.""I made some good pitches and they just hit them,"" Garcia said. ""Right now everything is going good for them. It\'s part of the game. You can\'t do anything about it.""Machado thought he\'d fouled Johnson\'s strike three pitch into the dirt when he struck out in the first. After plate ump Doug Eddings checked the ball and upheld the call, Orioles manager Buck Showalter came out to see the ball for himself.NOTES: Toronto GM Alex Anthopoulos told MLB Network Radio that SS Jose Reyes (left ankle) will play one more rehab game at Triple-A Buffalo on Monday, then will likely join Double-A New Hampshire when Buffalo goes on the road.

Speaking from personal experience as a semi-pro league umpire for a year, that is their training. It was surprising Manny Machado didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that. But I chalked it up to his being in the Major Leagues 4 1/2 months, even though that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be an excuse. This was a rare time when responsibility for a mistake got placed right at his doorstep.The Orioles dodged two bullets in a row this weekend, with Detroit beat Boston Saturday and Sunday at Comerica Park, helped out by a blown call on a dropped fly ball in the 8th inning. The\xc2\xa0Birds must be glad they\xe2\x80\x99re back home and off that Rogers Centre turf. It would be nice if \xc2\xa0the pitching could keep Mark Reynolds and Carlos Santana in the ballpark this week, when the Cleveland Indians come to town.The position of this blog on Bautista-gate is that Jose Bautista\xe2\x80\x98s antics going around the bases after Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s home run off Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day were bush, but that the best retaliation is winning the game. However, as the Orioles did not do that, all you can do is have a hot streak of your own and move into first place at some point. Then wait for the Jays to come back around.On other topics involving the future, setting aside any argument over whether Matt Wieters has earned an All Star appearance, staying home would work to his benefit. It would give his legs a much-needed rest. Nonetheless, getting picked as a reserve is not out of the question, if the manager wants to shut down the National League\xe2\x80\x99s running game.The most important thing Chris Davis has to do in the second half is to come pretty close to the consistency he has had up to now. The All Star Home Run Derby gets hitters into bad habits and poisons their performance. Davis is having comparable to the monstrous first half that Josh Hamilton had last year, and Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s season dropped off a cliff for much of the second half last season. Even though I\xe2\x80\x99m not pretending he\xe2\x80\x99ll sit out the Home Run Derby, it is a concern.At a later date, we\xe2\x80\x99ll address a few other things that have to happen in the second half, but just to give you sneak preview, priority No. 1 is pitching.

What happened next came as a surprise.The light-hitting Alexi Casilla capped a five-run seventh with a three-run homer, and the Orioles broke a four-game losing streak with a 6-3 victory Tuesday night in Baltimore.Davis tied the game at 3-3 with his major-league-leading 28th home run, a two-run shot. Casilla had not homered all season before crushing a pitch from Justin Masterson (9-6). On a team that leads the majors in home runs, contact can come from anyone \xe2\x80\x94 even the No. 9 batter.\xe2\x80\x9cThat takes pressure off the big guys, to know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got other guys who can contribute, and do contribute,\xe2\x80\x9d the leadoff hitter Nate McLouth said. \xe2\x80\x9cAlexi came up huge tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      That he did was much to the delight of his teammates, who have come to appreciate Casilla, a backup second baseman.

ANGELS 14, TIGERS 8 Albert Pujols doubled, singled, scored a run and drove one in \xe2\x80\x94 all in an eight-run fifth inning \xe2\x80\x94 and Los Angeles routed Detroit again. The Angels have won seven straight against Detroit, by a combined score of 48-17. Miguel Cabrera hit a two-run homer for the host Tigers, but he also made two of Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s six errors.

But with the overmatched Houston Astros switching from the National League to the American League West this season, the East suddenly has some competition for that doorway into the postseason.In essence, baseball\xe2\x80\x99s unbalanced schedule, in which teams play far more games against clubs in their own divisions, has meant that the Astros have turned into punching bags for some of the other clubs in the A.L. West, allowing them to fatten their records. And that has created a headache for A.L. East teams, who do not play the Astros nearly as often.The effect of this disparity could be telling. Before last season, when a second wild-card slot was introduced for each league, a team from the A.L. East took the lone extra spot in the playoffs in 13 of 17 seasons. And with the Baltimore Orioles capturing one of the two spots last season, the East has had a share of the wild card in each of the last six years.The standings in the American League have the Orioles and the Yankees tied for the second wild-card spot. Just two games behind them is another A.L. East club, the Tampa Bay Rays. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      But in the top wild-card spot, three games ahead of the Yankees in the win column and a game and a half ahead over all, were the Oakland Athletics of the A.L. West. A streaky team this season, they might not have been doing so well over all had the Astros not joined their division. Indeed, if you subtract the Athletics\xe2\x80\x99 9-0 record against the Astros this season, Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s record goes from 44-34 to 35-34, a winning percentage that would put them well out of contention.

Credit             Patric Schneider/Associated Press           And it is not just the Athletics who have benefited from the Astros\xe2\x80\x99 move. The Texas Rangers, currently leading the A.L. West by one game, have gone 5-1 against Houston. The Seattle Mariners are off to a back-and-forth start against their new division patsies, with a 4-5 record. The Los Angeles Angels are the exception in the division, having gone 3-7 against Houston, including a four-game sweep that the Astros somehow pulled off earlier this month. Over all, the Astros are 13-21 in division games.The situation is similar in the N.L. Central, the former home of the Astros, where the Cubs have a major league-worst 9-24 record against division opponents, which has helped lead to both leaders in the N.L. wild-card standings \xe2\x80\x94 Pittsburgh and Cincinnati \xe2\x80\x94 coming from that division.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Unfortunately for the Yankees, and the other four teams in the A.L. East, their division has no weak link. The Toronto Blue Jays are in last place, but they had an 11-game winning streak until the Rays beat them Monday.

Houston\xe2\x80\x99s general manager, Jeff Luhnow, has been engineering an ambitious rebuilding project for the last few seasons, letting the major league club suffer in hopes of creating a contender.The strategy has resulted in the team\xe2\x80\x99s picking first in the draft for two consecutive years, using those picks on Carlos Correa, a high school shortstop from Puerto Rico, and Mark Appel, a starting pitcher from Stanford.

06/26/2013,"[('Aaron Hernandez criminal cases timeline | FOX Sports', ' Aaron Hernandez, formerly the star tight end for the\xc2\xa0New England Patriots, has been accused of three shootings that left three men dead and two others wounded \xe2\x80\x94 allegations laid out in criminal charges in two of the cases and in a civil lawsuit filed in federal court in the third. Prosecutors in Boston allege that early the morning of July 16, 2012, Hernandez pulled up next to a car in South Boston and opened fire, killing immigrants Daniel de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Furtado, 28, and wounding another man. Alexander Bradley, alleged to have been with Hernandez when de Abreu and Furtado were killed, alleged in a federal civil lawsuit that Hernandez shot him in the face in Florida and left him for dead early the morning of Feb. 13, 2013.   And prosecutors in Fall River, Mass., allege that late on the evening of June 16, 2013, that Hernandez summoned two associates, Carlos Ortiz, and Ernest Wallace Jr., from Bristol, Conn., to his home in North Attleboro, Mass. From there, the three of them allegedly drove to the Dorchester section of Boston and picked up Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-pro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s fianc\xc3\xa9e. The four of them allegedly then returned the approximately 40 miles to North Attleboro, where prosecutors have accused Hernandez of driving into a secluded field in an industrial park. There, shortly before 3:30 a.m. on June 17, prosecutors allege that Hernandez, Ortiz and Wallace were involved in the murder of Lloyd, who was shot multiple times. Hernandez has been indicted by two separate grand juries on multiple charges: one count of murder and five weapons charges in Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s death; and two counts of murder, three counts of assault with intent to commit murder and a weapons charge in the killings of de Abreu and Furtado. To date, six people in addition to Hernandez have been charged with crimes related to the incidents: * Ortiz, originally charged with weapons possession, was later indicted as an accessory after the fact and then ultimately with murder in Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s killing. He is awaiting trial. * Wallace, originally indicted as an accessory after the fact, was later indicted on a murder charge in Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s death. He is awaiting trial. * Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s fianc\xc3\xa9e, has been indicted on a perjury charge, alleging that she lied to a grand jury. She is awaiting trial. * Tanya Singleton, a cousin of Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s, was indicted on charges of contempt for refusing to testify before a grand jury and conspiracy to commit accessory after the fact to murder for allegedly helping Wallace flee to Florida in Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s killing; and with contempt for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating the murders of de Abreu and Furtado. * Bradley, was arrested on charges of failing to answer a subpoena to testify before a grand jury and was forced to appear before the grand jury. * Oscar Hernandez, no relation to the former Patriot, was charged in federal court with obstruction of justice, witness tampering and lying under oath in a case in which he is alleged to have been involved in the transportation of three guns from Florida to Massachusetts that have been linked to Aaron Hernandez. The following timeline of events in the in the murders of de Abreu, Furtado and Lloyd and the subsequent arrest of Hernandez is laid out by detectives and prosecutors in search and arrest warrant affidavits and other court and police records on file in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Florida and in exhibits and testimony in Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s trail in Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s death. In all cases, the movements of Hernandez and people close to him are alleged by investigators and prosecutors based on cell phone records, surveillance camera images, interviews with witnesses and observations made by law officers, all of which are documented in police reports or court documents examined by FOX Sports or exhibits or testimony introduced in Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s trial. Exact or approximate times that are included were drawn from those public records. In instances where an event is based solely on a media report, that is noted. In addition, information was drawn from other publicly available records, including the University of Florida Media Guide and the New England Patriots Media Guide. 12:30 a.m.:\xc2\xa0Hernandez and a man later identified as Alexander Bradley enter Cure Lounge in south Boston just behind a group of five men, including Safiro Furtado, 28, and Daniel de Abreu, 29.

She also tells the officers that she and Hernandez recently installed a home security camera system because of several attempted break-ins; and that she went to bed early the night before but that Hernandez left their house at some point, although she says she is not sure who he was with or when he returned. As she is talking with officers, Hernandez calls her and tells her that his agent said she should not speak with police and should request an attorney.

They confiscate two cell phones, three iPads, a digital video recorder and a computer hard drive that is part of the home\xe2\x80\x99s security system. From them, they later extract digital images from the 14 security cameras mounted inside and outside the home. 10 p.m.:\xc2\xa0After obtaining a warrant, detectives search Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s cell phone. They recover images of the phone, and two lists of contacts. Unknown time:\xc2\xa0Investigators search the woods along the route Shayanna Jenkins may have taken the previous day. They find a .22-caliber handgun that \xe2\x80\x9cwas located on top of the ground cover and was a short distance from the roadway.\xe2\x80\x9d Investigators believe the gun had been recently discarded. The gun is the second Jiminez Arms pistol that was purchased in Florida. Unknown time:\xc2\xa0A forensic pathologist conducts an autopsy on Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s body, concluding that he was shot five times \xe2\x80\x94 once in the back, once in the abdomen, once in the right forearm, and twice in the chest. Both of those wounds were \xe2\x80\x9cthrough-and-through\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 meaning the bullets passed completely through his body. The doctor concludes that the two chest wounds were inflicted as Lloyd lay on his back on the ground. Detectives later return to the spot where his body was found and dig in the dirt, uncovering two bullets. 8 p.m.:\xc2\xa0Investigators execute a search warrant on the silver Nissan Altima owned by Enterprise Rent-A-Car, collecting several pieces of potential evidence: Photographs; fingerprints; swabbings; gunshot residue tests and tire impressions. The fingerprints were later matched to Lloyd, Wallace and Ortiz. Unknown time (evening):\xc2\xa0A manager at the Enterprise Rent-A-Car agency in North Attleboro calls police, telling them that she had cleaned the car out after Hernandez returned it and had thrown several items she found in the car into a dumpster: A Vitamin Water bottle, a piece of paper with a colorful child\xe2\x80\x99s drawing, a piece of \xe2\x80\x9cchewed\xe2\x80\x9d blue bubble gum, and a \xe2\x80\x9cbullet.\xe2\x80\x9d Officers immediately drive to Enterprise and search the dumpster. They discover a Vitamin Water bottle, a child\xe2\x80\x99s drawing, a piece of chewed piece of gum and a .45-caliber shell casing. The manager confirms that they were the things she had cleaned out of the car two days earlier. The shell casing is later determined to match the five shell casings found at the murder scene and was fired by the same gun. 4:27 p.m.: A man calls authorities in North Attleboro and tells a police dispatcher he wants to provide information about the 2012 murders of de Abreu and Furtado in Boston. The man gives the dispatcher details of the crime and says it is related to Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s killing. Asked if the same person was involved in both, the man says yes. When he is asked how he knows this, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone accidentally spilled the beans in front of me.\xe2\x80\x9d 1:30 p.m. (approximate):\xc2\xa0Investigators search an apartment rented by Hernandez in nearby Franklin. They recover four boxes of .45-caliber ammunition, one box of .22-caliber ammunition, and five boxes 7.62x39mm ammunition. In addition, they located and confiscated Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s cell phone. They also found keys to a Hummer H2 in the apartment and search the vehicle, which is parked outside. They located a loaded Glock .45-caliber magazine in the center console. A judge terminates the case against Ortiz and he is arrested on a charge of weapons possession by a previous offender. The charge is based on his statement that he picked up a .22-caliber handgun the morning of Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s murder and carried it into Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s house. Wallace is observed swimming in a pool in the backyard of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s home in Miramar, Fla.

Sitting down to watch a game, any game, you will be on the receiving end of a barrage of advertisements. Orioles games are no exception. Every in-game graphic and every commercial break is a new revenue opportunity for MASN, and in turn, the Orioles. Tuesday night\'s 6-3 victory over the Indians was completed in a relatively brisk 2:24. From the time the telecast kicked off at 7:00 until the last out of the game was recorded, there were 19 commercial breaks: a break prior to the first pitch; breaks after the top and bottom of eight full innings played; and two mid-inning pitching changes. During those breaks, there were a total of 56 commercials for 29 different companies. The quick pace of the game may have limited the opportunities for in-game sponsorship mentions, but there was still enough time to squeeze in 27 plugs for products for 19 different companies. These kicked off with the Orioles lineup presented by Southwest Airlines and continued all the way through to the end of the broadcast, when we were told the current results of the AT&T Player of the Game poll. A 7:07 first pitch plus 2:24 time of game means there were 151 minutes of MASN from the start of the telecast to the end of the game. There were 83 advertisements in that time. Most companies that had commercials also had sponsored segments, and vice versa: in all, there were 34 different companies who paid for some kind of placement during tonight\'s game.    That there is demand for prominent placement during Orioles telecasts should not be a surprise. The Baltimore Sun\'s television critic, David Zurawik, wrote in Sunday\'s paper that Orioles telecasts on MASN were the top-rated prime-time program for April and May among young adults in the Baltimore area. More people in ""the demo"" (adults 18-49) were watching Orioles games than The Voice.    This is the fifth-highest rated market in Major League Baseball this season, and the ratings represent an 86% growth over ratings for MASN telecasts during the 2011 season, according to Zurawik. That\'s more money in the bank for MASN, because there are only so many commercial slots for a baseball game, and they can charge more if there is more demand for advertisers to reach the eyes of those watching Orioles games. What MASN charges for ads is an interesting article on its own, though someone who actually knows would have to write it. That is not me. This is just about what you and I, the fans, will have trying to attract our attention.    Note that this is just one night\'s snapshot of advertising. Different nights may bring different numbers of commercials for different things, but there is likely no escape from the incredibly awkward C.J. Wilson and Josh Hamilton commercials for Head and Shoulders. Do you want to buy a car? MASN\'s advertisers think you do, or that you can be convinced to buy one with the right ad. Car companies represented the biggest segment of commercials, with ten different companies represented in 16 commercials. Did you feel like you saw a lot of Nissan? That\'s because you did: they aired the exact same commercial four times throughout the game. Other car companies with multiple slots had multiple commercials: Volkswagen aired three, with Chevy and Jeep airing two apiece. Two other companies also had four commercial slots, with PNC Bank (the only bank to advertise Tuesday night) and Southwest (the only airline) also airing the same commercial four times each. During lean years for the Orioles, it felt like every commercial break had at least one in-house MASN spot. Each of these is an ad spot not sold. Tonight, there were only three such spots. The O\'s also had three ads during the game. They probably pay for those, unless they don\'t. Southwest was the most frequently-mentioned during the actual telecast. In addition to their sponsoring of the O\'s lineup, two other random segments of the broadcast were ""presented by"" Southwest. The Orioles also got three plugs on their own broadcast: three separate pleas to take advantage of online promotions, including buy one, get one free for the rest of this series, and the Vote Orange All-Star promotion. Other companies with multiple in-game sponsorships include the Maryland Lottery, with its Hit It Big contestant of the game; Lowe\'s, which presents the scouting reports for the starting pitchers; Jeep, which sponsors all the horrible graphs and charts (seriously, anyone who works at MASN or anyone who knows anyone who works at MASN, please express to someone who matters just how awful the bar graphs are); and AT&T, with the Player of the Game text poll. One thing that was regrettably missing from Tuesday\'s broadcast, and as far as I have noticed, all of the games this year, is an advertisement for a beer or liquor where Gary Thorne can add his personal flourish to the copy: ""Drink responsibly."" In fact, while Tuesday\'s game was going on, there were not any commercials or spoken promotions for any alcoholic beverages at all, though one did air for Captain Morgan in the time between the final out and the beginning of O\'s Xtra post-game. Chances are that, while not all of the advertisements during an Orioles game will be targeted at you, at least some are. They wouldn\'t keep spending money if, in the aggregate, advertising was not effective. Enough people must use Luna Floors that we will hear that jingle (and that of Empire, which did not get a slot during Tuesday\'s game) for the rest of our time on this mortal coil. Maybe you would like a cheap haircut. Maybe you would like a deal on pizza after the Orioles win and score five or more runs. Maybe you can\'t decide where to eat some nights. An ad you saw or heard during an Orioles game might pop into your head, and then, there you go. And maybe, just maybe, some day, after you win the Mega Millions jackpot that you only decided to purchase because watching an Orioles game reminded you to buy a lottery ticket, you can stick all that money in a PNC Bank account. Then you can use that fortune to buy a couple of BMWs from your Baltimore BMW dealer, and Volkswagons for your kids, buy a big mansion, and load it up with Apple products on the AT&T network. You can watch all the O\'s games on MASN (or ESPN or Fox) on DirecTV, which you\'d sure better do, because you don\'t want to end up with your house exploding, or end up in a ditch, or end up going to your own funeral as a guy named Phil Shifley. And you can drive that BMW 320i sedan to and from all the Orioles games you\'ll go to with your season tickets that you decided to buy, with hair that Nate McLouth would envy thanks to Head and Shoulders, all the while knowing your family is in good hands with CareFirst Blue Cross and Blue Shield. It\'s fun to dream, isn\'t it? In the meantime, I hear if you\'re looking for fertilizer, you should try the starting rotation, because it\'s full of manure.

All to say \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m really old! I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of baseball for a lot of years, and every so often I weigh in here on the Birds Watchers blog with a few long-term observations about the game.Sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99m shocked by how much I can remember. For example, whenever I look at Washington Nationals manager Davey Johnson, it frankly strikes me how awfully old he looks. But then I remember how I can recall him as a rookie in 1965, where he was, well \xe2\x80\xa6 not the best. The next year, manager Hank Bauer replaced a pretty solid 2nd baseman named Jerry Adair with Johnson, causing Adair to demand a trade. But I digress.In the earlier half of my life (like three decades ago), when there were very close calls in a game and the TV coverage would show the slow-motion replay, practically NEVER would it prove the umpire to be in error. Over and over, when it would appear the guy in blue had missed it, rather, the replay would vindicate the ump.Jun 21, 2013; Toronto, ON, Canada; Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter (26) argues with home plate umpire Angel Hernandez (55) against the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre. Mandatory Credit: Tom Szczerbowski-USA TODAY SportsNow, blown calls are a daily experience. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying the Orioles are unusually victimized by this, as the screw-ups go both ways. The point I am making is that umpire error is now totally common instead of exceptionally rare. Lousy umpiring is affecting the outcomes of games. Truly, this was not the way it used to be.There is no doubt that overall the players are better from top to bottom on a team\xe2\x80\x99s roster. The great players of the past would be great players in the modern era as well; but the guys now are bigger, stronger, and faster than ever before. The benefits of weight training and year-round fitness and workout routines have made for a league filled with great athletes.So, the players are better, but the umps are worse. Why? I cannot explain it for sure. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not researched this or read anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s opinions on the subject. I merely report my observations. Perhaps it is simply that the better athletes make the game speed so much faster, resulting in more inevitable errors in judgment and observation?All of this of course calls for many to state a need for video reviews. The purist in me wants to reject the notion. I just wish the umpires were better and did their job with less errors. But if they continue to mess up at the rate they have been of late, the outcry might someday find a hearing. Never have I heard so much talk about how there needs to be greater accountability for umpires.I\xe2\x80\x99m writing this as the Indians/Orioles game three of the series is happening. There have been missed calls on Manny Machado at first base, along with mistakes in both directions on hit batsmen and a dreadful 3rd strike on a ball far outside on Chris Davis. As I write this paragraph, Buck Showalter is screaming at the ump for the Indians\xe2\x80\x99 delay of game in bringing in a reliever for the apparent (??) injury to Scott Kazmir.None of us go to the games to see the umpires perform.

Here\'s Dan Connolly of The Baltimore Sun, who was the first to have the news:  Doctors found a partial tear in Bundy\'s right elbow and it had worsened, according to his agent.\r \xe2\x80\x94 Dan Connolly (@danconnollysun) June 26, 2013    Given that today is the first day we have heard the word ""tear"" - or, for that matter, ""elbow"" - in relation to Bundy\'s injury, it\'s curious to hear this reference in past tense. If they knew about a tear all along, why the charade about platelet-rich plasma treatment and rest and resuming throwing? Why let him resume throwing at all if all parties were aware that there was a partial tear?    The above tweet seems to indicate that our worst fears were true, and all that\'s been done is wasting time. They have known something was off about Bundy since spring training. It\'s easy for me to say since I don\'t have to have a knife taken to my elbow ligaments, but any time there are mystery forearm injuries, it seems like that surgery is inevitable.    Now, instead of Bundy returning during spring training next year, he won\'t be back to where he can resume his work until around the All-Star Break next year. Twelve months is generally the expected recovery time. Dreams of Bundy bolstering the rotation down the stretch this year are long gone. Everything we\'ve ever seen and heard about Bundy indicates that he\'ll work hard to come back at his previous strength as soon as is biologically possible. He is still a young man, just 20 years old, and could have a long and great baseball career ahead of him.    As long as he is on the 40-man roster but assigned to the minor leagues, Bundy will not accumulate MLB service time while recovering. So unlike Stephen Strasburg, the Orioles don\'t lose a year of Bundy as a result of the Tommy John. Best of luck to Dylan on the surgery and recovery. The Orioles will still be there when he\'s ready to play again. Hopefully they\'ll even still be winning.

06/27/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Pitch displacement - Birds Watcher', 'An interesting thought crossed my mind in the first inning of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Baltimore Orioles game against Cleveland. Starter Miguel Gonzalez threw a one-strike pitch to a Cleveland hitter that was well high of the strike zone. Yet the hitter swung at the pitch, and fouled it off behind him. We spend a lot of time talking about quality at-bats in games, and hitters that seemingly have no problem fouling off pitch-after-pitch-after-pitch. Obviously when this happens it pressures the pitcher in that at-bat, and ultimately drives up his overall pitch count. Advantage: hitter. Hitting coaches love this, and it obviously drives pitching coaches crazy. However given the above-mentioned scenario, have we possibly found an inverse-type of situation?It\xe2\x80\x99s not a true reverse-type of situation in that it\xe2\x80\x99s not an apples-to-oranges comparison. The hitter in theory can stand there for an infinite amount of time at-bat; if a pitcher throws too many pitches he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be able to continue in the game. However in this age of sabremetrics in baseball when numbers are raked high and low to find competitive advantages, could we perhaps find a way to measure pitches that pitchers \xe2\x80\x9cget back?\xe2\x80\x9dThe term\xc2\xa0get back\xc2\xa0might not be the most romantic way of putting this concept into words, but work with me here! If a pitcher throws a pitch that is obviously out of the strike zone (and in many cases is not even designed to be in the strike zone) and the hitter bites, in my view there\xe2\x80\x99s a net gain of a pitch for the pitcher. Granted pitchers in essence throw pitches out of the zone purposely for the sole reason of trying to get hitters to bite. However if the hitter records a strike (regardless of whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s strike one, two, or three), the pitcher comes one pitch closer to his goal than he might have originally thought possible.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAgain, I\xe2\x80\x99m probably doing a lousy job of describing this. Yet I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something worth mentioning. The pitch in question with Gonzalez tonight was simply a rising fastball. If the hitter lays off that pitch, Gonzalez has wasted a pitch and he\xe2\x80\x99s one pitch closer to a base runner. However if it gets fouled off (which in this case it did), that pitcher gains an advantage that he otherwise wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had. A better way of looking at it is that if the count is 1-1 and the batter lays off of that rising fastball, the count is now 2-1, you\xe2\x80\x99re a pitch closer to a base runner, and the pitcher has to then potentially waste another pitch to obtain strike two. Again, not a true inverse of a hitter fouling off multiple pitches, but it does strike you as a bit of a pitch-saver in the long run.

The procedure will end a frustrating season in which the right-hander never threw in a game.""Hopefully, next year this time we\'ll be putting a date on when he\'s going to be pitching again in a game,"" Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said Wednesday.Selected fourth overall in the 2011 amateur draft, Bundy made it to the big leagues with Baltimore last season and was expected to contribute again this year. But he developed arm soreness during spring training.The 20-year-old received treatment in April. When he resumed throwing, Bundy felt pain in his elbow and again was shut down.After being examined by team orthopedist Dr. John Wilckens and Dr. James Andrews, it was determined that Bundy needed Tommy John surgery.""Dr. Andrews and Dr. Wilckens have been on the same page about everything,"" Showalter said. ""We tried to see if we could keep from going down this direction, but when he had the setback throwing from a certain number of feet, I think they felt like there was some distress there.""At that point, surgery appeared to be the best option.""The thinking was that Dylan is 20 years old, he\'s very young and it\'s early in his career,"" said executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette. ""After giving it two times of significant rest and the elbow not responding and being capable of handling the workload required, the doctors and Dylan decided this was the best course. We certainly support it.""The Orioles have no regret over treating the injury with medication and long stretches of inactivity.""I think it\'s always best to try the conservative approach and to try rest and recuperation,"" Duquette said. ""In Dylan\'s case, he gave it two chances to rest and recover. He\'s also very young, so he has time to be able to come back and pitch effectively.""The sooner Bundy gets the operation, the sooner he can begin the extensive rehabilitation program.""Dylan is ready to go,"" Showalter said. ""You think about everything he\'s been through with this; he just wants to get it done and to be able to pitch without discomfort. This is probably kind of new to him. You try to keep it from happening, but in a lot of cases it\'s preordained. So you take the precautions you need to take, and hopefully it doesn\'t happen.""And at least now Bundy and the Orioles understand why he had pain when he threw.""I think there\'s some peace where that\'s concerned. We\'ve got this behind us, we know what it is, it\'s nothing that he\'s doing wrong or something he\'s got to do differently.

Then, shortly after Nate McLouth, the No. 8 hitter who had rapped out Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s first hit in the sixth, launched a towering home run in the seventh to give the Orioles the lead for good, Sabathia\xe2\x80\x99s demeanor soured even more.After getting the final out, he walked off the mound and gestured in frustration but restrained himself. Once he reached the dugout steps, he could contain his anger no longer. He fired his glove at the back of the bench and followed suit with his cap, unleashing a torrent of rage that seemed to encapsulate the team\xe2\x80\x99s losing state of affairs.In two innings, Sabathia went from pitching possibly his best game of the season to suffering a 4-3 loss. The Yankees lost for the third straight game and fell a season-high five and a half games out of first place in the American League East.

In typical fashion, the veteran left-hander blamed himself for giving up a three-run lead and losing the game. No matter that he had pitched so well through five sterling innings or that he had rediscovered some of his best stuff.

It was an embarrassing night on the national stage as Rodrigo Lopez gave up eight runs in just 1 1/3 innings against the Chicago White Sox. The winning pitcher for the White Sox that night was Freddy Garcia. This Sunday, the Orioles are back in the limelight. Chris Tillman will face off against Hiroki Kuroda, and hopefully at about 11 p.m. that night the O's will complete a three-game sweep of the Yankees. In preparation for the game on Sunday, ESPN reached out and offered me the chance to do a Q&A with their Baseball Tonight analyst, Alex Cora. Cora played fourteen major league seasons for six different teams, and joined the Baseball Tonight crew this year. He appears on both BBTN and Beisbol Esta Noche on ESPN Deportes.  Question: Thanks so much for answering a few questions for Camden Chat. The Orioles and Yankees face off this weekend and have been battling for second place in the A.L. East for most of the season. Which team do you think is better off right now and what would each of them need to do to put themselves in a better position to compete through the rest of the season?    Alex Cora: Both teams have been doing a great job with what they have. We all know about the Orioles offense but their pitching staff needs to get better. They have some holes. With the Yankees, nobody thought that they'd be in this situation. Surviving was playing .500 baseball until everyone got healthy. They've done a better job than expected. If we are fair with the Yankees, I think they are in a better position right now. They are only going to get healthier and their pitching staff has done a great job.    Q: Buck Showalter has been given a lot of credit for the success in Baltimore the last two seasons. Based on your experience as a player, what kind of manager tends to get the best out of his players? And what have you observed about Showalter that you think makes him so good at his job? AC: With Buck, there is structure. When he took over in Arizona, you could tell that there was only one way of doing things. One thing about Buck's teams, they are going to be prepared. They play the game right. No matter who is playing, who is in the lineup, they have the same goal and the same mentality. They go out there with the plan they have and they really think they are going to win the game. It's impressive when he took over in Baltimore a few years ago to have such a quick turnaround. Nobody saw this coming except probably him. Watching his teams play is always a treat.    Q: When he was drafted, Manny Machado played shortstop exclusively and stayed at the position through his time in the minors. He's been an outstanding third baseman, though, for 130 games in the majors. Given your experience around the infield when you played, how tough would it be for Machado to move over to shortstop in 2015 when J.J. Hardy's contract is up? Will not playing the more difficult position for 2 \xc2\xbd seasons affect him negatively? AC: He'll be fine. It's always hard to go from short to third. He had limited experience in the minor leagues and he's learning to play the position. He's playing shortstop at third base. The only play he doesn't have to make is going a long way to his right, but he plays deep at third, he's still going to his left and coming in to the ball. To be honest with you, I'm becoming a huge Manny Machado fan. I love the way he goes about his business and what he brings to the table every day. Nothing against J.J.  J.J. is doing a great job. I can't wait to see Manny playing shortstop; he's just that good defensively.  But we're not pushing J.J. to retirement yet! Q: Prior to the season starting, you picked the Orioles to win one of the wild card spots in the American League. Are you still confident in that pick after seeing what the Orioles are made of over these first three months? AC: I am but the one thing I feel they need to do is improve their rotation. I know their bullpen is really solid but when you have to go to them every day for four innings it's tough to do it. This year the division is tougher than last year. The Red Sox are a lot tougher than what people thought, including myself. They need to improve that pitching staff. I know Kevin Gausman is a part of that, hopefully he can help turn it around. But they need one guy. There's a few out there. Obviously, if they get that guy I will feel more comfortable about them still winning the Wild Card. Q: Regarding Sunday night's game that is airing on ESPN: Chris Tillman will be on the mound for the Orioles vs. Hiroki Kuroda. After three disappointing seasons, Tillman has spent the last two looking like the pitcher the Orioles hoped he'd be when they traded for him. Do you think that he has the stuff to continue to be successful, or high home run rates and left on base % come back to haunt him? AC: It's like everything else. If he's finding the strike zone, he'll be fine. I don't think his stuff is off the charts but he's a solid pitcher. The key is to get ahead. It seems like he's turned the corner. When you have to face the Red Sox, the Yankees, Toronto and pitch in that division, the numbers can be very deceiving. He's done a good job. They are happy with what he's done this season and I think he can keep it up.   "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles 7, Indians 3: A Strange, Strange Rally - Camden Chat', ' With the possibility of a series loss looming, the Orioles turned to the man who is likely their best starter right now, Miguel Gonzalez. He was opposed by promising sophomore Corey Kluber, who came into tonight\'s game with a 3.68 ERA and an excellent 5.31 strikeout-to-walk ratio. It looked to be an interesting pitching duel, and for the first half of the game, it largely was. Indians leadoff man Michael Bourn reached on a single to start the game, and after Mike Aviles struck out, Jason Kipnis ripped a single into right, putting men on first and third with one out. Gonzalez recovered to strike out Jason Giambi and get Carlos Santana to fly out to left, stranding the runners but throwing twenty-two pitches. In the bottom half, Nate McLouth and Manny Machado hit back-to-back singles, but Nick Markakis grounded right back to Kluber, who began an easy 1-6-3 double play. Adam Jones then lined softly to third, ending the inning and a great scoring chance. In the second, Gonzalez got a groundout and a strikeout before giving up a solo homer to Lonnie Chisenhall. Drew Stubbs then singled on the tenth pitch of his at-bat, but Gonzalez struck out Bourn. Unfortunately, the Stubbs at-bat and having to work for each out meant his pitch count was already at fifty, after just two innings. Chris Davis and Matt Wieters began the bottom of the second with a walk and a single, giving the O\'s the same opportunity as in the prior inning. J.J. Hardy then bunted - yes, you read that right - to bring up Travis Ishikawa. I know Hardy isn\'t the best hitter in the world, but do you really want to forfeit his at-bat to in favor of Ishikawa and Ryan Flaherty? Well, apparently you do, because while Ishikawa struck out, Flaherty came through with a grounder up the middle, driving in both runners (yes, Wieters even managed to score from second). Nate McLouth grounded out, but the Orioles had taken the lead, 2-1. The third inning was uneventful; Gonzalez allowed a hit but managed his first short inning of the game, throwing just eleven pitches, and the O\'s were retired in order. In the top of the fourth, Michael Brantley led off with a double. Mark Reynolds followed by grounding out to third and failing to advance the runner, but Lonnie Chisenhall got to Gonzalez again, doubling to the right-field corner and tying the game. Chisenhall advanced to third on a flyout to right by Drew Stubbs, but was stranded when Michael Bourn did the same, leaving the score at 2-2. Davis led off the O\'s frame with a double to right, but Wieters struck out, and Hardy and Ishikawa grounded to short and third.    The Indians retook the lead in the fourth on Mike Aviles\'s leadoff shot to left. Miguel Gonzalez retired the next three batters, but it was now 3-2, Indians. Then, the bottom of the fifth happened. I\'m going to break this down in bullet-point format, because it\'s just too confusing (and probably a wall of text) otherwise.  Ryan Flaherty led off with an opposite-field single. Nate McLouth singled up the middle on the ninth pitch of his at-bat, and Flaherty made it to third on the play.  Weird Thing 1: Manny Machado struck out swinging, and rookie umpire Will Little - seemingly trigger-happy, oversensitive, or both - ejected Machado. Whatever Manny said looked innocuous enough on the broadcast, but post-game interviews with Buck Showalter and the umpires suggest it wasn\'t an overreaction.  Nick Markakis redeemed himself by singling up the middle to tie the game. Weird Thing 2: Adam Jones blooped one to right, and the Orioles barely avoided a TOOTBLAN: McLouth held up late at third, and Markakis slipped halfway past second, but Mark Reynolds didn\'t see Markakis fall in time to make a throw. Weird Thing 3: Chris Davis hit a grounder to second, but Jones\'s hard slide and Davis\'s hustle helped prevent a double play and allowed McLouth to score. Or, so we thought: replays showed that Jones was actually called safe at second - Aviles didn\'t get the neighborhood call - but was then called out when he left the field, not having heard the ""safe"" call. Weird Thing 4: Matt Wieters then doubled into the right-field corner, driving in Markakis and Davis; Drew Stubbs had trouble picking up the ball, allowing Davis to score and Wieters to reach third on the error. That gave Wieters his first multi-hit game in two weeks.  Weird Thing 5: J.J. Hardy hit a swinging bunt towards third, but Kluber kicked it towards the Indians\' dugout, allowing Wieters to score and sending himself to the showers.  Nick Hagadone struck out Travis Ishikawa to end the inning, but the O\'s had scored five runs, making it 7-3.  That\'s got to be the weirdest five-run rally I\'ve ever seen, but, hey, we\'ll take it. The rest of the game was uneventful, at least score-wise. Miguel Gonzalez his first 1-2-3 inning in the sixth; he threw 50 pitches in the first two innings (pace: ""Oh crap I\'m not making it through five innings tonight""), and 48 pitches over the next four (pace: complete game). The O\'s also went down in order in the sixth, and Gonzalez came back out for the seventh, striking out two but allowing a single to Michael Bourn in between. Buck Showalter then called in Brian Matusz to face Jason Kipnis, and Matusz preserved Gonzalez\'s quality start by inducing a popout. Gonzalez\'s final line, and outing overall, ended up very solid despite the rough start: 6.2 IP, 3 R, 2 HR, 0 BB, 9 K. Those nine strikeouts tied his career high.The seventh-inning stretch brought a downpour, leading to a seventy-eight-minute rain delay. When play resumed, the bullpens mopped up; former Oriole Matt Albers and Bryan Shaw retired the six O\'s hitters they faced, while Troy Patton had a clean inning and Darren O\'Day allowed just a single. O\'s win, 7-3.The Red Sox also won tonight, but a Yankee loss pushed them a game behind the O\'s, who remain 3.5 games back from Boston. Tomorrow, the O\'s can try to increase their lead over New York, as T.J. McFarland will face David Phelps.

06/29/2013,"[('Orioles 11, Yankees 3: Chris Davis hits two home runs to ...', "" There is an alternate universe wherein the 1996 Orioles, unencumbered by the Jeffrey Maier play, went on to win the World Series. In that universe, it is the Yankees franchise that turned into an overpriced, underachieving team for the next decade or more, while the Orioles quality still shines on. I have often wondered what that universe might look like. Tonight's 11-3 victory over the Yankees, with Chris Davis hitting two home runs to blast a team stocked with a number of possibly washed-up guys off the playing field, was a glimpse into that universe. Though the final scoreboard totals make it look like an Orioles victory was inevitable, this was not the case. The top of the first inning saw the bases loaded against Zach Britton after three ground balls snuck through the infield. The usual Orioles starter disaster loomed large, but Britton escaped the jam with no runs crossing the plate. The BABIP dragon was unkind to him: all of the grounders resulted in base hits with the fly balls and line drives bringing the outs. Thanks to that escape, the Orioles came up to the plate with a chance to take the lead. That's when the fun began. After Nate McLouth popped out foul - he was the only Oriole starter not to get a hit tonight - the O's got three straight singles by Manny Machado, Nick Markakis, and Adam Jones. The Jones single was a ground ball that barely snuck by Yankees third baseman David Adams. They can't all be Machado. Jones got an RBI, and two men were on for Chris Davis against Yankees starter David Phelps. Phelps, we were helpfully informed before the game by the Buck/McCarver broadcasting tandem, struggles in the first inning and then tends to settle down. What kind of things might a pitcher who struggles in the first inning do? Say, do you think he might leave a hanging slider out over the plate, just about belt-high, against a left-handed batter who crushes right-handed pitching?    BOOM. The swing was one of those where you knew the ball was gone off the bat. The ball landed in the Orioles bullpen, with the relievers scattering instead of their usual game of trying to catch the homer. Relievers took cover like there was incoming mortar fire as the ball ricocheted off the bench and around like a pinball. This Earl Weaver Special was the 29th home run of the season for Davis, and put the Orioles ahead 4-0.    As the Yankees offense found little traction against Britton, the Orioles kept scoring. The third inning brought Davis to the plate again. Phelps wanted no part of him, and he walked. Matt Wieters followed that up with a single, and J.J. Hardy walked to load the bases. Chris Dickerson delivered a two-run single, no small feat as it scored Wieters from second with less than two out. Up to the plate came Ryan Flaherty. He has to know his days as a starting second baseman are numbered, because Brian Roberts will be back tomorrow. Flaherty will not go quietly. He swatted one last poor pitch from Phelps onto the flag court, the second three-run homer of the game for the O's, to make the score 9-0 and chase Phelps from the game.    Flaherty has now hit safely in eight straight games and, after a 2-4 night, is batting .214/.278/.355. That's not good, but the .789 OPS Flaherty is sporting in June is trending the right way. Will he keep getting chances, and will he stay hot? Britton gave every indication he would cruise through the game through five innings, with 58 pitches thrown through five. Then, as with the last start, the sixth inning started. Britton would walk three guys in the inning, and while he should have gotten out of it with only one run in, a Chris Davis error on an inning-ending grounder prolonged the inning and chased Britton. If you want to know why he doesn't have a spot solidified in the rotation, it's because he does things like walk three batters in one inning, an inning which he began with a nine-run lead. There was no excuse of a high pitch count. He simply could not find the strike zone the third time through the order. A 5.2 inning outing with only one earned run surrendered doesn't look bad, but six hits and three walks with only one strikeout is not good, either. Britton should have gone seven and could not even go six. He was relieved by Jair Jurrjens, who finished the sixth and pitched the seventh and eighth while allowing three hits and no runs. Jurrjens will probably only be on the roster for this game, with Roberts due to be activated tomorrow. He was one-day bullpen help, and he helped. Phelps was relieved by Ivan Nova, who didn't have a bad outing of long relief, finishing out the final 5.2 innings of the game, giving up six hits while striking out four, with no walks. The only problem for Nova was Davis. Was it even a problem? The pitch was low and away, the kind of pitch Davis often lunges for and misses, while tossing his bat into the stands. Instead, his one-handed swing made contact and the ball went high into the sky and came down on the flag court, his 30th of the season. 11-2 Orioles. All of the offense was part of a 15-hit flurry, with six Orioles having multi-hit games. The Yankees did not do bad in the hit column themselves, with 11. The Orioles have Davis (and Flaherty!) and the Yankees do not. Pedro Strop gave up a run on two hits in the ninth to finish the game with the final 11-3 score, treating a sellout crowd of 46,607 to the O's second straight win over the Yankees. With the win combined with a Boston loss, the Orioles now find themselves 2.5 games back in the American League East, with a 46-36 record. After 82 games last year, the Orioles were 44-38, 5.5 games back in the East.

Undermanned and running out of whatever magic propelled them to a 30-18 mark on May 25, the Yankees resemble a middling or even last-place team more than a playoff contender.

They outhit the Orioles by 11-5 and scored three runs, far better production than they could muster Thursday, when they were stifled in a two-hit shutout.The Yankees have struggled much of the season to produce on offense, ranking 12th in runs scored out of 15 teams in American League with 305 runs in 79 games. Their team batting average, .239 entering Saturday, was 14th, as was their slugging percentage (.379).That is not surprising given that four of the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 best five hitters over the last several years \xe2\x80\x94 Derek Jeter, Curtis Granderson, Mark Teixeira and Alex Rodriguez \xe2\x80\x94 are out with injuries.Joe Girardi was asked what he, as a manager, could do to overcome such a stagnant offense.

How many times have you heard growing up playing baseball did you hear the adage, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make the first or last out at third base?\xe2\x80\x9dWell, Machado heard it, too. But he was watching center fielder Brett Gardner, who was flat-footed, meaning Gardner wasn\xe2\x80\x99t completely set to unleash a throw immediately.\xe2\x80\x9cI saw him camping under the ball and in that situation there, you really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to tag up especially with the ball in left center field,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he camped up and I thought I had a pretty good shot at it and I went for it\xe2\x80\xa6. It\xe2\x80\x99s a do or die play. Something that Buck allows us to do is play our game. If you have a shot for it, go for it.\xe2\x80\x9d var adSkipCounter = 0; After the game, Showalter \xe2\x80\x93 who is about as old-school baseball as you\xe2\x80\x99ll find in certain situations \xe2\x80\x93 echoed those sentiments.\xe2\x80\x9cIf you always become a prisoner to the book ...,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell guys all the time, if you feel something, you\'ve got a good feel, go for it. And I got the other part of it after it\'s over, but I\'m going to be upset if you feel something and don\'t go for it. That\'s the type of intelligent recklessness you have to have.\xe2\x80\x9dSo add \xe2\x80\x9cintelligent recklessness\xe2\x80\x9d to Machado\xe2\x80\x99s quickly expanding game.Kevin Gausman is going to be a good major league pitcher; that seems nearly inevitable.\xc2\xa0 But this is all a learning experience for him.And he learned something Friday after he threw 4 1/3 scoreless innings.When Nate McLouth homered in the bottom of the seventh to give the Orioles a 4-3 lead, Gausman was concentrating on the game. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize that it made him the pitcher of record. And when the Orioles held onto the lead, the 22-year-old didn\xe2\x80\x99t initially realize that he had earned his first big league win.\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t really know if (a credited win) had to be the same inning or if you had to throw a pitch after that or anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Gausman said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then after people started congratulating me, then I said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way it is.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9dGausman chuckled while telling the story. Gotta love rookies.Here\xe2\x80\x99s a weird little twist for you: Gausman got his first big league win in fellow rookie T.J. McFarland\xe2\x80\x99s first big-league start. McFarland picked up his first big league win on June 13 in relief of Gausman (in Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s fifth major league start).McFarland lasted just 2 2/3 innings Friday, givingup seven hits, one walk and three earned runs against the New York Yankees. Not exactly the debut start he was anticipating. But don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s his last start with the Orioles this year.The club loves this kid, his competitiveness and the way he pitches to contact. He may not get another start the next time around \xe2\x80\x93 an off-day Monday and Wei-Yin Chen\xe2\x80\x99s likely return Thursday will allow the Orioles to shuffle things in the rotation \xe2\x80\x93 but he\xe2\x80\x99ll get another shot at some point. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure about that.Last thing: Yes, Tommy Hunter got the two-inning save Friday. Yes, Brian Matusz was warming up in the ninth and not Jim Johnson. No matter.Johnson is still the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 closer. He pitched three consecutive games from Monday to Wednesday and, though he told Showalter he was available Friday, Showalter told Johnson before the game that he was going to stay off of him.No controversy here.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

', 'articles.baltimoresun.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Nate the McGreat - Birds Watcher', 'The Baltimore Orioles gave T.J. McFarland his first big league start last night against New York, but the results weren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly what they hoped. McFarland\xe2\x80\x99s line: 2.2 IP, 7 H, 3 R, 1 BB, 4 K. In fairness, McFarland is far from the only relief pitcher to come out of the bullpen and struggle in a spot start. There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that McFarland deserved the opportunity to start a game, but being a starter is also a different mindset than being a reliever. One thing that stuck out at me is that McFarland was on an incredibly short leash; normally I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Buck Showalter would yank a guy that quickly (in general). But with this being a spot start and with McFarland presumably going back to the bullpen, you probably don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to go too deep if he\xe2\x80\x99s struggling so as to keep him fresh for a potential long relief role in the coming days.New York got to McFarland early when Robinson Canoe sent an RBI-single into right field to give them a 1-0 lead. Chris Stewart would also plate two runners in the third against McFarland, who was then lifted in favor of Kevin Gausman with the Orioles trailing 3-0. Of all things, Gausman might have turned in the best outing in his very short career last night\xe2\x80\xa6in relief. Over the course of his 4.1 IP, he gave up three hits and struck out four. One very interesting factoid about last night\xe2\x80\x99s game is that New York only walked once, and that was issued by McFarland. Normally they\xe2\x80\x99re a very patient team at the plate and they work the count and take walks left and right; not last night. Obviously many of their players are also hurt, so that probably makes a bit of a difference.NY starter C.C. Sabathia became the third opposing pitcher this week to flirt with a no-hitter against the Orioles, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t get their first hit until the last of the sixth. Nate McLouth led off the inning with a single, and as was the case in the two Cleveland games the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 offense came to life after that. Alexi Casilla followed McLouth\xe2\x80\x99s hit with an infield single, and suddenly the Birds had something cooking. Manny Machado plated both runners with a one-out RBI-double, and suddenly the Orioles (who had previously been being no-hit) had cut the lead to 3-2. Machado advanced to third on a J.J. Hardy pop out, and when Adam Jones was able to leg out an infield base hit the Orioles tied the game.\xc2\xa0Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsNate McLouth obviously was the catalyst in the above-referenced scenario given that he got things started. Luckily for the Orioles, he also finished things up as well. One thing I noticed early in the season was that Oriole starters were pitching well for five innings or so, only to collapse unannounced in the sixth inning. Buck Showalter is apparently not the only manager who has that problem, as we saw a similar meltdown from Sabathia last night. (However to be frank, had I been Joe Girardi I would have lifted Sabathia after the three-run sixth inning so as not to put him into a position to potentially lose the game.) With two outs in the seventh, McLouth came up to face the tiring C.C. Sabathia, and promptly sent a 1-0 pitch onto the flag court in right field. Suddenly the Orioles led a game in which they were previously being no-hit, 4-3.Tommy Hunter pitched the eighth and ninth innings, and the Orioles took game one of this series. This was a game that with which the Orioles have served themselves well by winning. Sabathia has always been a thorn in their side, and they weren\xe2\x80\x99t even supposed to see him until tonight. Girardi moved his start up to last night, but the Orioles got to him just in the nick of time. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will send Zach Britton back to the mound tonight in game two of this series, which will begin at 7:15 and be televised regionally by FOX. Britton will be opposed by David Phelps.

It was not the sort of parabolic blast that had made Hafner one of the American League\xe2\x80\x99s most feared hitters in recent years, but it was a base hit, and perhaps that should have been reward enough for a slumping slugger.Instead, Hafner tried to stretch a single into a double, and as he rounded first base, gravity worked its merciless business on his 240-pound frame. He was out easily at second, and on a swampy Sunday night at Camden Yards, the sequence typified everything that had gone wrong for the Yankees through the first half of a trying season.Their 4-2 loss to the Baltimore Orioles marked the midpoint of what is fast becoming a 162-game slog for the Yankees, whose all-consuming deficiencies with the baseball bat were once again on display. They managed six hits against the surging Orioles, who used solo home runs from Manny Machado, Chris Davis and Nate McLouth to complete a three-game series sweep.\xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s important, and I understand that,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Joe Girardi said after his team dropped to fourth place in the American League East, just two games ahead of the last-place Toronto Blue Jays. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this is a game.

Hafner\xe2\x80\x99s base-running failure was only one example. In the second, Ichiro Suzuki popped out to leave the bases loaded. In the seventh, after an Orioles fan deflected a foul ball that would have been a sure out, the Yankees put men at first and second with one out. Brett Gardner promptly flied out and Suzuki popped back to the pitcher.

First off, the game was televised by FOX, with their A-team announcers of Joe Buck and Tim McCarver in the house. They seemed to show the Orioles an immense amount of respect, and even alluded to the fact that they could potentially represent the American League in the World Series. I think that Orioles fans would prefer to live in the here and now, however point taken; the Baltimore Orioles are a good team. FOX also seemed to go to great lengths to showcase the city of Baltimore and Camden Yards with their camera shots going in and out of commercials, which is nice to see. For so many years if the Orioles got a FOX game it would only be due to the fact that they were playing New York/Boston; not anymore.Zach Britton was solid through five innings, but once again struggled in the sixth. Britton\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.2 IP, 6 H, 2 R (1 earned), 3 BB, 1 K. Britton ended up loading the bases with two outs in the first inning, and many fans at the yard probably got flashbacks of games against New York years ago. However Britton battled out of it without surrendering a run. The O\xe2\x80\x99s put the first two runners on base in the last of the inning, and Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-single scored Manny Machado to put the O\xe2\x80\x99s ahead 1-0. We spend so much time talking about opportunities that the Orioles waste, runners left on base (in scoring position), etc; New York wasted a golden opportunity in the first inning, and they paidCourtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportsdearly for it. Chris Davis followed up Jones\xe2\x80\x99 effort with a three-run homer to center field, his 29th on the season.The O\xe2\x80\x99s were at it again in the third, with Chris Dickerson legging out an infield hit with the bases loaded (a ball that was bobbled by SS Jayson Nix), scoring Chris Davis and Matt Wieters. That brought Ryan Flaherty to the plate\xe2\x80\xa6the same Ryan Flaherty who\xe2\x80\x99s desperately trying to keep his job when Brian Roberts is activated tonight. Flaherty certainly made a good lasting impression, smacking an Earl Weaver special\xc2\xa0to right field. That put the Orioles ahead 9-0, and effectively ended the competitive portion of the game. Just for good measure however, Chris Davis decided to get one more in and sent a no-doubter onto the flag court in the last of the sixth. Coming out of the game, Davis stands at 30 homers on the year which leads the majors.The one mini-concern in this game is the fact that for the third consecutive start Zach Britton was unable to get out of the sixth inning. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a problem last night, but Oriole bats aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to put up 11 runs every game. To me this is an issue with endurance as opposed to \xe2\x80\x9cstuff.\xe2\x80\x9d Britton\xe2\x80\x99s sinker was sinking well last night \xe2\x80\x93 for five innings. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth incidentally; for five innings he was really good. He had trouble finding the plate in the sixth, which tells me that he was tired. Earlier in the day the Orioles DFA\xe2\x80\x99d Travis Ishikawa and called up Jair Jurrjens from triple-A Norfolk. (If Ishikawa clears waivers he could either accept a minor league assignment or opt to become a free agent.) Jurrjens came in to reliever Britton, and promptly ended the NY threat. Pedro Strop came in to close out the ninth inning and while he surrendered a run to NY, the outcome was never in doubt.One thing that struck me was that when NY manager Joe Girardi lifted starter David Phelps in favor of Ivan Nova, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see another NY reliever. Did Girardi ask Nova to \xe2\x80\x9ctake one for the team\xe2\x80\x9d and complete the game so as not to have to use another pitcher? That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a position in which the O\xe2\x80\x99s have found themselves in the recent past, and it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to see someone have to do that\xc2\xa0against\xc2\xa0the Birds. The Orioles are getting a lot of national publicity this weekend, which is good for the franchise as well as the city of Baltimore. Last night\xe2\x80\x99s game was technically not a national telecast, however it was FOX\xe2\x80\x99s A-game as part of their Saturday baseball package. (Basically, if you\xe2\x80\x99re in an area which did not have a regional game, you saw the O\xe2\x80\x99s and NY.)Tonight the Orioles will forego the normal 1:30 Sunday game in favor of an 8 PM start on ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday Night Baseball. The entire country will hopefully get a trip to \xe2\x80\x9cTillman Island\xe2\x80\x9d tonight, as Chris Tillman goes for his 10th win of 2013. Tillman will be opposed by Hiroki Kuroda. The Orioles will celebrate the aforementioned return of Brian Roberts tonight, out since the third game of the year with a hamstring injury. Everyone is speculating about whether Flaherty or Alexi Casilla will be the corresponding roster move; my prediction is that it\xe2\x80\x99s Jair Jurrjens who\xe2\x80\x99s sent to the minors \xe2\x80\x93 for now. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will also need to make a roster move prior to Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s game in Chicago when Nolan Reimold returns. (But if push comes to shove, I predict that Casilla would be the odd man out; he\xe2\x80\x99s played well for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, but I think that Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s upside is much higher.) A win tonight would mean a three-game sweep of New York for the Orioles, and before a national TV audience at that. If only Orioles fans could have seen this coming circa 2007!

The guy hit 33 home runs last season. True, he\xe2\x80\x99s got 30 as of Sunday morning, but still nothing to scoff at. When Davis first came up with the Rangers, he was hitting for impressive power. That\xe2\x80\x99s where he got his nickname \xe2\x80\x94 Crush Davis. That is (according to my Rangers fan friend) until the power numbers dropped off and the strikeouts went up, and he was given a less friendly nickname.O\xe2\x80\x99s fans remember the broken bat home run Davis hit last year at Camden Yards. It was one of the most impressive feats of strength I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen in a baseball game. He was left holding a splinter in his right hand, but the ball cleared the wall above the grounds crew in right center. The guy is strong.The difference this year is pitch selection. Davis is being more discerning, swinging at fewer bad pitches, and working the count. (It\xe2\x80\x99s what Adam Jones had been doing for the first 5 weeks of the season.) He seems more poised at the plate, and has more confidence in his knowledge of the strike zone. He\xe2\x80\x99s using the whole field more, though many teams still employ the shift on him.For those that think this is a fluke, they are wrong. Sure, teams are going to make adjustments and pitch him differently. But so far, he\xe2\x80\x99s hitting just about everything. Both homers last night were on breaking balls.Harold Reynolds remarked last night on MLB Network that Miguel Cabrera will definitely catch Davis in the home run race, and will win a second consecutive triple crown. He certainly may, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not such a sure thing as Reynolds may think. Cabrera hit 44 homers last season to lead the league, a career high. Davis is currently projected to hit 59. Even if he falls short of that mark, Cabrera will need to hit at least ten more than his season high. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bet against Cabrera, but Davis will absolutely give him a run for his money.

The five RBIs gave him 79, second-most in the big leagues and just six short of his career high.Davis is the first player in Orioles history to hit 30 home runs before the end of June. With one more long ball in the next 14 games, Davis will break the franchise record for home runs before the All-Star break, set in 1996 by Brady Anderson.""You can\'t make mistakes,"" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ""We made two mistakes with two curveballs tonight. We left them up in the zone and he hit them both out. He\'s not hitting 1.000, but I will say he is having a tremendous year. You have to make your pitches.""Given that Davis\' career high for home runs in a season is 33, who could have seen this coming?""I don\'t think it\'s anything you can predict,"" Davis said. ""I think it\'s something you obviously work hard toward in the offseason to try and carry it into spring training and then into the season. I\'m not going up there to try and hit home runs. I\'m just trying to put good swings on good pitches. I think that\'s the biggest thing.""Davis scored three runs and upped his batting average to .333.

If you give up nine runs, it\'s a big hole to dig yourself out of,"" Phelps said. ""The last four or five games I\'ve gotten good run support. It\'s frustrating to go out there and not give them a chance to do it.""The Yankees have lost 12 of 17 to fall within four games of .500 (42-38) for the first time since April 26 (13-9).

Two walks and a single loaded the bases for Chris Dickerson, who singled in two runs. Flaherty followed with a three-run shot to chase Phelps, who was replaced by Ivan Nova.New York chased Britton in the sixth.

Chris Davis -- known as the ""Hulk"" or ""Crush"" -- is a soft-spoken slugger who suddenly has commanded the attention of fans within and well beyond his home field.BOX SCORE: Yankees at OriolesSunday night, the Baltimore Orioles first baseman slugged his major league-leading 31st home run, which also boosted his MLB-best totals in slugging percentage  (.728) and total bases (217). He also boasted a .332 batting average with a .406 on-base percentage and 25 doubles, all top-five marks. Somehow, the powerful lefty sees room for improvement.""I feel like I\'ve been dragging lately,"" he joked. ""I was hoping I could step it up a little in these next few months.""Davis is poised for a historic run: He\'s on pace for 59 home runs, which would shatter Baltimore\'s franchise record of 50 held by Brady Anderson, and he\'s the first player to reach 30 homers and 25 doubles by the end of June, according to Elias Sports Bureau. Second only to Detroit Tigers third baseman Miguel Cabrera in American League All-Star voting, Davis is nearly a lock to start the game.HE DID IT AGAIN: Davis homers as Orioles sweep YankeesThat\'s a stunning turnabout for a player whose penchant for strikeouts prompted the Texas Rangers to trade him in 2011, despite his immense power potential. The rebuilding Orioles had the luxury of letting Davis work out his contact woes and now, at 27, they are getting the best of his prime power years.Quiet and humble on and off the diamond, Davis remains something of an enigma. But he, along with some close associates, shared insights with USA TODAY Sports.**Chris Davis once endangered little kidsWell, not exactly.But if you\'ve seen many of the 30 home runs he has pounded over major league fences this season, it\'s not hard to imagine the damage he inflicted on the amateur level.Even with a wooden bat.As a burgeoning slugger at Longview High School, two hours east of Dallas, Davis attended several Perfect Game Showcases, designed to highlight his wares for scouts.At his first such combine, held in Lincoln, Texas, a playground was situated well beyond the right field fence, ostensibly out of harm\'s way.Using a wooden bat, Davis easily sent pitch after pitch in that direction, making it rain baseballs on the playground\'s unsuspecting patrons. Of the 20 pitches of batting practice he took, more than half landed there, and a few settled well beyond it.""They probably set up a net after that showcase,"" joked teammate and longtime friend Tate Casey. ""I played with him, and even I was like, \'Holy cow.\'""Still, the climb was long. Davis knew playing at Navarro Junior College, about 55 miles south of Dallas, would best boost his draft stock. He went from a 50th-round pick out of high school by the New York Yankees to a 35th-round pick of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2005 and finally to a fifth-round pick of the Rangers, signing in 2006.***Chris Davis is a snack-stealer One of Davis\' and Casey\'s favorite high school memories are their long road trips to games and summer leagues across Texas. The two drove in a Ford F-150 pickup truck blasting rapper 50 Cent\'s debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin\', much to Davis\' chagrin.""Tate used to wear that thing out,"" Davis said of the album. ""He\'s a big, tall white guy from West Texas. I told him, \'You\'re a redneck!\'""On one particularly uneventful trip from Houston to Dallas, they realized they could use Casey\'s father\'s gas card to buy snacks. So they did just that, stopping every time they saw a gas station to refuel the truck and stockpile as many bags of chips and bottles of Powerade that they could hold.The plan worked flawlessly until the next time they had a long drive. Casey\'s father had mysteriously lost the gas card, and Davis and Casey never saw it again.***Chris Davis is a softie when it comes to footballIn another life, Davis might have been playing a different sport entirely. The righty pitched in high school, and his fastball regularly graced the lower 90s on the radar gun; his two-inning relief performance in a 19-inning win at Boston\'s Fenway Park was something of a turning point in the 2012 Orioles\' season.Thanks to that arm strength, Casey convinced Davis to join Longview (Texas) High\'s football team as the quarterback. In theory, the move seemed perfect: Davis was tall, athletic and had an accurate arm. In practice, though, the match was over before it really even started.""I think he came out for four days, maybe a week,"" said Casey, who went on to play tight end at the University of Florida. ""I think he knew where his future was.""Davis\' enjoyment of the game as a spectator hasn\'t subsided. In the offseason, he and Orioles catcher Taylor Teagarden -- also a Texas native -- make the drive to Arlington for Cowboys games and to Austin to watch the Texas Longhorns.""We love sports, and we have a big passion for football,"" Teagarden said. ""We spend a lot of time off the field together, guys\' kind of things. But we don\'t do anything crazy though -- we\'re both pretty chill.""Although Teagarden and Davis have been teammates in Baltimore for less than two seasons, their friendship began many years ago. The pair became close in the Texas Rangers organization when they played at Class A Bakersfield (Calif.) in 2007; they made their big league debuts less than a month apart in 2008. After being traded to the Orioles in separate transactions, the two are happy to remain part of the same organization.""It\'s cool to have a guy you\'ve been through so much with on the team,"" Davis said. ""It\'s like having a brother here.""***Chris Davis has learned how to chill outDespite his soft-spoken nature, Davis is almost universally regarded as a leader by his peers. In the past, some of the high regard came from his serious and professional demeanor in the clubhouse and on the diamond. It\'s an attitude he has had since high school, and sometimes it got the best of him.Now a first baseman, Davis manned third base at Bakersfield in 2007. Before a game, he and the rest of the infield were warming up by fielding ground balls, and Davis felt that manager Carlos Subero hadn\'t sent enough in his direction. Upset, he started to walk back to the dugout, but Subero confronted him and the two began to argue.""It wasn\'t a selfish act,"" Subero, now a minor league manager in the Angels organization, recalls. ""He gets so focused, and he was ready to get his bunch of ground balls.""After the spat, Davis apologized to Subero, and the two never had a similar issue again. And in the six years since the incident, the rising star has become more lighthearted in the clubhouse while maintaining his role as a leader.""He doesn\'t take baseball too seriously, and I mean that in a good way,"" said Orioles teammate Nate McLouth. ""He\'s a good dude.""***Chris Davis doesn\'t like to crush CrushResting on a hanger in his clubhouse locker at Camden Yards hangs a bright orange shirt with the word ""Crush"" emblazoned on the front, in the font of the popular soda brand. Yet while Davis likes his nicknames, he\'s not one to wear the apparel.""The only time I wear my shirt is during a game,"" he said, gesturing toward his Orioles uniform.Plenty of fans do it for him. Baltimore sponsored a Davis T-shirt giveaway in May, and shortly after the 10,000 freebies were distributed, they went for as much as $115 each on eBay.Weeks later, dozens of people walk Eutaw Street on game days with the silhouette of his follow-through printed on their backs. Others simply don tees with the traditional Crush logo. They anticipate the extraordinary every time Davis steps to the plate. It\'s a lot of pressure for the first baseman, but he has taken it all in stride.""He hasn\'t changed a bit,"" said Orioles hitting coach Jim Presley. ""He has matured as a player, and matured as a hitter.""Davis was never a soda drinker, and the beverage with which he shares a name is no exception to the rule. Instead, a carton of water sits on the floor by his locker, and a reusable bottle rests on a suitcase nearby. But advertising executives at Crush shouldn\'t be too worried: Davis\' bat provides plenty of pop.CONNECTTWEET                              11                      LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com')]"

[Trading for it] is always a possibility."" var adSkipCounter = 0; There are plenty of options for the Orioles if they are going to jump into the trade market \xe2\x80\x94 with a tandem of Chicago Cubs right-handers, Matt Garza and Scott Feldman, and Houston right-hander Bud Norris appearing to be toward the top of the club\'s wish list.The Orioles have had talks \xe2\x80\x94 some external, some internal \xe2\x80\x94 involving more than a half-dozen starters. As one industry source said, ""Dan\'s been busy.""Duquette won\'t talk specifics, but he said he believes there are ""some good pitchers on the trade market.""The Orioles\' rotation is currently led by Chris Tillman, Miguel Gonzalez and Jason Hammel, with Wei-Yin Chen expected back from an oblique injury soon. Zach Britton, Kevin Gausman and T.J. McFarland are among the pitchers on the 25-man roster that could fill the fifth rotation spot.Britton also could be trade bait along with talented but enigmatic Triple-A starter Jake Arrieta. With Gausman likely untouchable and injuries to two of their other top prospects \xe2\x80\x94 right-hander Dylan Bundy (Tommy John surgery; out until 2014) and infielder Jonathan Schoop (stress fracture in back; has begun baseball activities) \xe2\x80\x94 the Orioles don\'t have many highly regarded youngsters in their system. The best of the rest is 20-year-old lefty Eduardo Rodriguez, whom the Orioles are reluctant to deal.""We\'ll see where it goes, but we have the wherewithal to make a trade or two if we think we need to make a trade,"" Duquette said. ""Our farm system is improving and other teams like some of our players. And not just our marquee prospects, but we have some other prospects.""Although the Orioles have big league pitching depth, they don\'t have anyone established at the top of the rotation and their stalwart bullpen has shown cracks this year.""Pitching is not just one or two spots \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s the whole staff,"" Duquette said. ""And last year we were really strong in the bullpen and our bullpen is not as strong as it was last year. And our starting pitching, until recently, hasn\'t been in the middle of the pack.""Duquette seems to be content with the club\'s offense, although a more established designated hitter \xe2\x80\x94 Philadelphia Phillies infielder and Buck Showalter favorite Michael Young is one veteran expected to be available \xe2\x80\x94 wouldn\'t hurt. Duquette, however, said he thinks the club has enough internal candidates \xe2\x80\x94 including Brian Roberts, Nolan Reimold and, eventually, Wilson Betemit \xe2\x80\x94 that obtaining another hitter is not a priority.So if the Orioles make a move this month \xe2\x80\x94 ""The market is just starting to take shape,"" Duquette says \xe2\x80\x94 it will be for a pitcher.

And in front of a national audience, playing the only game on the schedule at the time, the burgeoning Orioles unveiled their promise \xe2\x80\x94 and power \xe2\x80\x94 to the baseball world while sweeping the struggling Yankees out of town. var adSkipCounter = 0; \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\'ve gotten your nose bloodied as much as we have through the years,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said, \xe2\x80\x9cevery opportunity to take another step toward where you want to go ...\xc2\xa0 it certainly touches your emotions.""The ESPN broadcast spent most of the night highlighting the Orioles\' blossoming stars \xe2\x80\x94 first baseman Chris Davis and third baseman Manny Machado \xe2\x80\x94 and the pair did their share to write the perfect TV script.In recording their first three-game sweep of the season, the Orioles hit three solo home runs against Yankees right-hander Hiroki Kuroda \xe2\x80\x94 including Davis\' league-leading 31st of the season and Machado\'s first homer in 219 at-bats \xe2\x80\x94 in front of an announced crowd of 40,878 that included managing partner Peter Angelos watching from his suite.\xe2\x80\x9cEven before the game, when we were out there getting ready, you could kind of feel the buzz in the stadium,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt did kind of have that playoff feel \xe2\x80\x93 close game, the fans were obviously in it. It was a fun atmosphere to play in. I think we kind of feed off the crowds, especially when we\xe2\x80\x99re playing a team like the Yankees because we know they travel well. And when you can hear our fans drowning out their fans, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good feeling.\xe2\x80\x9dMoments before closer Jim Johnson brought the\xc2\xa0go-ahead run to the plate and ultimately recorded the final out of the night for his 100th career save, the crowd began chanting ""Sweep the Yankees."" A grounder to second base ended the game, sending the Orioles to their fourth straight win and the Yankees down the steps of the visiting dugout having been dominated.Against a New York team devoid of its typical star power, the Orioles (47-36) completed a three-game home sweep of the Yankees for the first time since April 15-17, 2005. The Orioles entered the weekend just one game ahead of the Yankees for second place in the American League East standings, but Sunday\'s win sent New York (43-40) into fourth place in the division.The win also marked the Orioles\' fifth straight against the Yankees at home for the first time since Oct. 3, 1981 to June 21, 1983, when the O\'s took 10 straight from New York in Baltimore.The last time the Orioles played on Sunday Night Baseball, Kuroda tossed a complete-game shutout against the O\'s at Yankee Stadium on April 14.It wouldn\'t go as smoothly for Kuroda \xe2\x80\x94 who had allowed just nine homers in his previous 16 starts this season \xe2\x80\x94 this time.Machado, who also hit his league-leading 38th double of the season, hit his first homer since May 5 in the first inning, taking three breaking balls down in the zone before lining an elevated slider into the left-field seats for his sixth homer of the season.Machado, who had three hits on the night, recorded his 34th multi-hit game of the season.Since his callup last August, Machado has hit 13 major league homers, breaking the Orioles\' team record for the most by a player before his 21st birthday set by Boog Powell in 1961 and 1962.With his 31st homer of the season \xe2\x80\x94 a solo shot in the second inning \xe2\x80\x94 Davis broke the Orioles\' club record for most homers before the All-Star break, set by Brady Anderson in 1996 on his way to a team-record 50 homers. But after 83 games, Davis is on pace to smash that mark with 60 homers in 2013. His 31 homers are the most by the end of June since 2001, when Barry Bonds hit 39 and Luis Gonzalez had 32.Davis\' homer, his third in the past two games, came on a 2-1 sinker that the first baseman sat back on and sent the opposite way beyond the left-center field fence.Nate McLouth hit his second homer of the series, a solo shot that landed over the scoreboard in right field to give the Orioles a 3-1 lead.Orioles right-hander Chris Tillman ended June with his sixth win this month, marking the first time an O\'s pitcher won six games in one month since Rodrigo Lopez in July 2002.Despite battling a high pitch count early, Tillman (10-2) won his seventh straight decision and his sixth straight start. He entered the night carrying an 8.16 career lifetime ERA against the Yankees, but he held New York to two runs on five hits over six innings.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

Chicago also received Baltimore\'s international signing bonus slots Nos. 3 and 4, which will help the struggling franchise pick up foreign talent.Feldman started 15 games this season in his first year with the Cubs and amassed a 7-6 record with a 3.46 earned-run average.  Before his time in the Chicago, Feldman spent eight years with the Texas Rangers and won 17 games in 2009, good for fourth in the American League. The righty was scheduled to pitch on Tuesday night in Oakland.MEET: MLB\'s most disposable commodityThe Orioles are 2 1/2 games back of Boston in the American League East and in line for a wild card berth but have the second-worst team ERA in the baseball (4.43). They recently designated starting pitcher Freddy Garcia for assignment and called up Kevin Gausman, who started games earlier in the year and has since been used as a long reliever.Feldman, 30, will make $6 million in 2013 and be eligible for free agency after the season.ALL-STAR TEAM: Will Puig make it for NL?""Our intent was to stabilize our rotation ... and we think this deal will do that,"" general manager Dan Duquette told the Baltimore Sun. ""We had to weigh it against other factors.""Strop had a letdown season in Baltimore after a breakout performance in 2012. The reliever\'s 7.25 ERA was worst on the Orioles of any pitcher with over 10 appearances. Arrieta had a 7.23 ERA in five starts for Baltimore, his last a 4 2/3-inning debacle in which he surrendered five runs and 10 hits to the Tigers. Clevenger, who went to high school in Baltimore, appeared in just eight games for the Cubs this year and recorded just one hit despite putting up gaudy numbers in Triple-A ball.NIGHTENGALE: Corbin states his caseFeldman was a valuable member of Texas Rangers playoff teams in 2010 and 2011, and his near-flawless performance in three outings of the 2011 AL Championship Series was a key to the Rangers\' six-game triumph over the Detroit Tigers.Arrieta, 27, emerged as a top prospect soon after the Orioles drafted him in the fifth round in 2007. But he struggled to maintain a spot in their rotation and instead will try to regain his prospect status with the rebuilding Cubs.""Sometimes a change is (needed),"" Duquette told the Sun. ""This will be a fresh start for Jake and I wish him a lot of luck.""CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Cubs deal Feldman to Orioles, Marmol to Dodgers', ""CHICAGO (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Chicago Cubs dealt starting pitcher Scott Feldman to the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday and traded former All-Star Carlos Marmol to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for veteran reliever Matt Guerrier.The Cubs got right-handed pitchers Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop as well as two international signing bonus slots from the Orioles in exchange for Feldman and catcher Steve Clevenger.Feldman signed a one-year contract with the Cubs and went 7-6 with a 3.46 ERA in 15 starts this season. He is 46-50 with a 4.66 ERA in 219 major league games over nine seasons.Feldman was scheduled to start Tuesday night at the Oakland Athletics. Instead, lefty Chris Rusin was called up from Triple-A Iowa to take his place.Arrieta is 20-25 with a 5.46 ERA over the last four seasons with Baltimore (2010-13). Strop was 5-2 with three saves, 24 holds and a 2.44 ERA last season as the primary setup man for the Orioles. He has battled a back strain this year, going 0-3 with a 7.25 ERA. Arrieta will be assigned to Iowa while Strop is expected to report to the Cubs later this week.Guerrier is 25-33 with six saves and a 3.54 ERA over 10 seasons in the major leagues. He went 2-3 with a 4.80 ERA this season before being designated for assignment by the Dodgers on Sunday. The Cubs designated Marmol for assignment last week after he had gone 2-4 with two saves and a 5.86 ERA in 31 appearances, striking out 32 while walking 21 batters.An All-Star as a setup man in 2008, Marmol's best year as closer was 2010, when he had 38 saves in 43 chances along with 138 strikeouts and 52 walks. But fans had been booing him and management was eager to cut a deal with the Dodgers, who also acquired an international signing bonus slot.The Cubs also said they had acquired two international signing bonus slots from the Houston Astros for minor league infielder Ronald Torreyes, who batted .260 with two home runs and 25 RBI in 64 games with Double-A Tennessee this season. He was originally acquired by the Cubs with left-handed pitcher Travis Wood and outfielder Dave Sappelt from Cincinnati for left-handed pitcher Sean Marshall in 2011.Sappelt was recalled from Iowa, and outfielder Ryan Sweeney (fractured rib) was placed on the 60-day disabled list retroactive to Sunday.

For two nights, Black\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers had held the Boston Red Sox to a total of six runs. But they had to work hard for every out, Black said, and the Padres lost both games anyway.Before the series finale, at a steamy and sold-out Fenway Park, Black started with the basics when assessing the Red Sox lineup.\xe2\x80\x9cThe names are good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, a subtle but revealing insight into the way the rest of baseball still sees the Red Sox.

One of them, Allen Webster, worked six innings here Thursday for his first victory.

The previous inning, Dunn misplayed a grounder by Matt Wieters, paving the way for the tying run to score and depriving Quintana of his first victory since May 21.""The way Q pitched and how that inning went down, it was good any way we could to get a win,"" Dunn said.Quintana struck out a career-high 11 in seven innings. He allowed two hits and retired his last 13 batters.Reliever Addison Reed (2-0) wound up with the win.Dunn\'s home run was his 23rd this year. He has batted .272 in June and July after a .156 average in April and May.""I think that it\'s probably a little bit of everything,"" he said about  his turnaround. ""The things we\'ve been working on since spring training just kind of paying off now.""""Like I said from Day One, I\'ve felt pretty good all year. Just wasn\'t getting any results. Now it seems like I\'m swinging at a little better pitches and putting some good wood on it,"" he said.Dunn also singled in a run to help Chicago take a 2-0 lead in the sixth.""He\'s dangerous any time he goes up there. But again, just the quality of the at-bats is great to see,"" Chicago manager Robin Ventura said.Quintana was locked in from the start.""The beginning of the game I felt I had really good control and I felt I\'m really going to be able to do some things,"" he said a translator. ""That\'s s what led to me striking out so many batters.""Quintana seemed as if he would get the elusive victory after the sixth. Alex Rios broke up a scoreless tie with an RBI single and Dunn followed with an RBI single off Orioles starter Zach Britton.Baltimore scored twice in the eighth off reliever Nate Jones, one on Dunn\'s error and the other on Nick Markakis\' sacrifice fly.Quintana said the no-decision didn\'t bother him. His previous strikeout high was eight, set against Texas on July 5, 2012.""Those are things you can\'t control,"" he said. ""The most important thing to me is that the team wins. The best thing that I can do for the team is give the team a quality start, give the team the opportunity to win and give a quality outing.""Britton struck out three, walked one and gave up six hits over seven innings in his longest stint of the season.""Both guys pitched real well,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  ""There was only going to be a small margin of error. We were fortunate to push over a couple there out of their bullpen.""""Quintana was tough. I mean, that was solid. I can see why they\'re so high on him. He\'s been pitching well for them. They\'ve got a lot of good young pitchers but Zach matched him for the most part,"" he said.Dunn decided the game by connecting on a curveball.""It\'s a pitch you don\'t want to throw to him,"" Hunter said. ""I would like to bury it. There were a couple righties coming up right after him.""NOTES: Ventura said RHP Jake Peavy, on the disabled list since June 6, will throw Friday.

The 1,496th was a high school slugger from Longview, Tex., named Chris Davis. The Yankees used their 50th-round choice that summer on Davis, just in case he changed his mind about attending the University of Texas.\xe2\x80\x9cThe Yankees actually sent a contract to my house,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis said Friday in the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse at Yankee Stadium. \xe2\x80\x9cI was happy to be drafted, but at that point I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even close to being ready to think about pro ball. And the fact that it was the third-to-last pick wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very enticing anyway.\xe2\x80\x9dDavis, 27, has been the breakout star of the American League this season, arriving for a three-game series in the Bronx with a .327 average, 32 homers and 83 runs batted in. He has no regrets about turning down the Yankees, he said, even though he never did play for the Longhorns.After one semester at Texas, Davis enrolled at a junior college, and he signed with the Rangers two years later as a fifth-round pick. The draft lasts only 40 rounds now, and Davis said he doubted the Yankees would have stuck with him if he had struggled.

In his first full professional season, he hit 36 homers. The next year he hit 40, including 17 for the Rangers. He also struck out prodigiously, and his reputation began to harden around the game: big power but lots of strikeouts.\xe2\x80\x9cPower\xe2\x80\x99s always been my forte,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there was ever a question of whether I had power. It was, was I going to be able to make contact consistently and give myself a chance to let that play?\xe2\x80\x9dThe Rangers reached the World Series in 2010 but left Davis off their roster. He had continued to thrash Class AAA pitching that season, but Mitch Moreland had supplanted him as the organization\xe2\x80\x99s major league first baseman.

By then Davis had nothing more to prove at Class AAA, with a .337 average and an on-base plus slugging percentage of 1.006.

But in what has become a ritual this season, the focus before the game was on rehabilitating veterans who will be in various parts of the United States this weekend, but not in the Bronx.On a day when the Yankees scored two runs in the bottom of the ninth to steal a 3-2 victory from the Orioles, they received significant and potentially positive news involving Derek Jeter, who is recovering from a twice-fractured left ankle. The Yankees announced that Jeter, their 39-year-old shortstop and captain, will begin his long-awaited minor league rehabilitation assignment Saturday night in a game with Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.The present Yankees had trouble mustering any type of offense Friday night at Yankee Stadium, and they seemed likely to waste a stellar start from Ivan Nova. Down by 2-1 in the ninth, the Yankees loaded the bases against Jim Johnson, who started the inning by giving up a single to David Adams and muffing a soft grounder from Brett Gardner that allowed him to reach first. Ichiro Suzuki moved the runners into scoring position with a sacrifice bunt, and Johnson intentionally walked Robinson Cano to bring up Travis Hafner.It seemed a risky move for an Orioles bullpen that had already blown an American-League-leading 16 saves. For Hafner and Vernon Wells, who was batting behind Hafner, it was a chance at redemption after neither of them could push across a run with one out and the bases loaded in the fifth. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Johnson walked Hafner on four pitches, and Wells followed with a single through the left side of the infield to score Gardner and send the Yankees to their fifth straight win.

What Nova did, he gave up the one home run early and was just really, really good,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Joe Girardi said, referring to Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x99s two-run blast in the second. \xe2\x80\x9cBut our guys just kept going at it.\xe2\x80\x9dThe rally also made Nova\xe2\x80\x99s 3-hit, 11-strikeout performance hold up. Nova, making a spot start in place of the injured Hiroki Kuroda, improved to 3-2 and lowered his earned run average 4.09 in what was the first complete game of his career.\xe2\x80\x9cI told a couple of the guys, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible I can pitch that way and we can lose,\xe2\x80\x9d Nova said.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Before the game, the Yankees said that Jeter was expected to play at least five innings for the RailRiders. By jumping directly to Class AAA without any games at a lower minor league level, he already appears to be ahead of Alex Rodriguez in their quests to return to the Yankees, for whom neither has played a single inning this season.

No wonder all these teams and fans hate each other!So, I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d look forward to seeing the Orioles get to the Bronx, but after the last three days in Chicago, the change was welcomed!In this recently completed series, the White Sox three starters \xe2\x80\x93 John Danks, Hector Santiago, and Jose Quintana \xe2\x80\x93 held the Orioles to a combined 4 runs on 11 hits over 21 innings.\xc2\xa0 They also gave up but 4 walks while striking out 24. They were just that good, not that the Orioles have some awful slump falling upon them. The Quintana performance yesterday was especially impressive, as he was largely unhittable.So, I entered this evening\xe2\x80\x99s first game at NY looking forward to Ivan Nova facing the Birds. He had only started five games this season and came in with but 35 innings pitched and a 4.66 ERA. His last performance was against the O\xe2\x80\x99s on June 29 where he went 5.2 innings in relief, giving up 2 runs on 6 hits after David Phelps allowed 9 runs in 2.1 innings.Well, it turned out to be more of the same unhittable stuff from a guy having his best game of the season. Nova pitched an incredible game, going 9 innings and giving up only 2 runs on 3 hits, and striking out 11. Fortunately for the Orioles, one of those hits was a 2-run 2nd-inning Matt Wieters homer following a HBP of Chris Davis.Jul 5, 2013; Bronx, NY, USA; Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Miguel Gonzalez (50) pitches against the New York Yankees during the first inning of a game at Yankee Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsOrioles starter Miguel Gonzalez was not as sharp, though he only gave up a single 5th-inning run. Sporting an excellent split finger pitch, he however struggled with his command on pretty much everything. Miguel battles his way through so many difficult situations. In the bottom of the 5th, on a 3-0 pitch on Travis Hafner with the bases loaded after an Ichero double and intentional pass to Robinson Cano, he showed no stress. He fought his way back to get an out on a short fly to center field, with Vernon Wells then fouling out to Davis. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99 final line was 6 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 4 BB, 5 K \xe2\x80\xa6 and the Birds would take a tenuous 2-1 lead through 8.5 innings.Of course, even with half the regular Yankees on the DL, it remains the toughest three outs in baseball to finish a close game in New York in the ninth inning. Ugh! It is never easy. A leadoff single by David Adams was followed by an error on Jim Johnson on a bunt. A successful sacrifice by Ichero and intentional walk to Cano loaded the bases with one out. For the second time in the contest, Hafner faced a 3-0 count with the bases loaded. This time Hafner took ball four to tie the game. Next, Vernon Wells drilled the game winner through the hole at short to pull out the 3-2 comeback win for the Yanks.I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to watch the Twitter feed and what would be said about Jim Johnson. Gosh, another blown save and loss. I\xe2\x80\x99ll write that it crossed my mind to bring back O\xe2\x80\x99Day for the first batter in the ninth, and then use Brian Matusz for the row of lefties at the top of the order. But we all know that Buck Showalter is not going to do business that way. I wrote just two days ago that Jim Johnson is not right. I fear these blown saves could be, in retrospect, the difference-maker at the end of the season in not making the playoffs.You really should not win a game when you only get three hits, but you should get a win when you take a lead to the ninth inning.Painful, painful loss.Other Birds Watchers Observations \xe2\x80\xa6The Orioles are #13 in the AL in taking walks \xe2\x80\x93 more than 100 less than Oakland and Boston, the top two teams. It would seem that better pitch selection would benefit their already potent offence a good bit more. But the Birds are also #11 in strike outs, whereas Boston is #4 with over 100 more.The O\xe2\x80\x99s are second to Boston in team doubles, but dead last in triples with only five.Here is an interesting statistic: \xc2\xa0Batters\xe2\x80\x99 average age (weighted by AB and games played). \xc2\xa0The Orioles are the third youngest team in the AL, trailing only Houston and Kansas City.

At times, he has struggled to find his command and has even acknowledged losing the feel for his signature cutter. Worse, he has struggled to find answers.Saturday was not Pettitte\xe2\x80\x99s finest day, either, although he persevered despite early-inning trouble to pitch six and two-thirds innings and record his sixth win of the season in the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 5-4 victory against the Baltimore Orioles in the Bronx.

Chris Davis earns the nod at 1B, J.J. Hardy will take the field at SS, and Adam Jones will start somewhere in the OF, probably, but not assuredly at CF. Manny Machado was also selected as a reserve. THE ORIOLES STARTERS Chris Davis, Orioles (1B) - Thesuarus.com lists 90 synonyms for the word ""great"". It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough for Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 2013 season. He leads MLB in home runs. He leads MLB in slugging percentage. He leads MLB in total bases. He\xe2\x80\x99s second in the AL in batting average, second in the AL on-base percentage, second in the AL in runs scored, second in the AL in runs batted in, and second in the AL in Baseball-Reference\xe2\x80\x99s Offensive WAR. We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a hitter who\xe2\x80\x99s struck out 95 times (sixth highest in the AL) and still is second in the league in OBP. He was the leading All-Star vote recipient across both leagues. Given the stats and his popularity, no sane individual could have argued against his starting. It will be Davis\xe2\x80\x99 first All-Star team appearance. Adam Jones, Orioles (OF) \xe2\x80\x93 We know Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 flaws by heart. He swings and misses at too many breaking balls low and away. He plays too shallow. He\xe2\x80\x99s 30th in FanGraph\xe2\x80\x99s UZR American League outfielder listings. He went 182 plate appearances without a walk between May 18 and Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s night\xe2\x80\x99s free pass. But you know what? Adam Jones is really, really good. He\xe2\x80\x99s 3rd among AL outfielders for hits, 4th in SLG, 6th in batting average, and 6th in HR. Is he the best OF in the American League? No one will argue that. Is he one of the best three? Quite possibly. And with 4.2 million votes, he had two million more votes than the next most popular outfielder going into the weekend. Worthy or not, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like this was close. It will be Jones\xe2\x80\x99 third All-Star team appearance, but his first starting. J.J. Hardy, Orioles (SS) - Hardy is here because Baltimore fans are generous people and love defense. It\xe2\x80\x99s not for his batting average of .256 or his sub-.300 OBP. But oh my, that glove. Hardy ranks 2nd on the Baseball-Reference.com list for Defensive WAR, although Fangraphs has him at just 7th in UZR (their preferred measurement of defense). He has the 8th highest OBP in the AL among shortstops. But his 15 HR are more than double the next AL shortstop, and his SLG of .439 is second in the league. So, maybe chicks (and dudes) loved the long ball enough to justify clicking on Hardy. Stranger things have happened. It will be Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s second All-Star team appearance, and his first in the American League.    THE REST OF THE STARTERS Robinson Cano, Yankees (2B) \xe2\x80\x93 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lead AL 2B in WAR (that would be Dustin Pedroia), average (Pedroia, again), slugging (that\xe2\x80\x99s Jason Kipnis) or OPS (Kipnis, again). Fangraphs thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s the worst defensive 2B among the nine who qualify in the AL. But he\xe2\x80\x99s your AL starting 2B, beating out Dustin Pedroia handily in the fan vote for the starting nod. Based on WAR, it should have been Pedroia, based on most stats, it should have been Kipnis, but Cano it is.    Miguel Cabrera, Tigers (3B) \xe2\x80\x93 He may have falling-down range at best at the hot corner, but when you bat .361 over the first half, no one cares. Cabrera is on pace for a second AL MVP award, and if not for Chris Davis, he\xe2\x80\x99d be looking at a second Triple Crown as well. Manny Machado has more WAR (at least, when using the Baseball-Reference.com version), and is a much, much, much better fielder, but honestly, the fans got this one right. Cabrera is a generational talent with a bat in his hands. Joe Mauer, Twins (CA) \xe2\x80\x93 He\xe2\x80\x99s leading catchers in the AL in average, OBP, and WAR. His 100 hits (after Friday\xe2\x80\x99s games) are 21 more than the next catcher. FanGraphs has him as the 2nd best defensive catcher in the league. He\xe2\x80\x99s the catcher who should be starting, and the fans made it so.    David Ortiz, Red Sox (DH) \xe2\x80\x93 Only six DHs have batted enough times in the AL to qualify for leaderboards, and this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an especially tough choice for fans. Ortiz leads in every stat category except hits, and that includes stolen bases. Seriously, he leads in AL DHs in stolen bases. (You can look it up!) He\xe2\x80\x99s putting up a typical Big Papi season, and starts the All-Star Game as a result. Mike Trout, Angels (OF) \xe2\x80\x93 He leads AL OF in average, on-base percentage, slugging, OPS and WAR. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad year. Defense? Not so much. dWAR hates him, though, ranking him 53rd of 54 in the AL among all players who\xe2\x80\x99ve played CF this season for even one game. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fare much better at FanGraphs. Among AL CF who\xe2\x80\x99ve played at least 10 innings, he\xe2\x80\x99s 33rd. But he\xe2\x80\x99s not getting elected for his defense, he\xe2\x80\x99s getting elected for his bat. Jose Bautista, Blue Jays (OF) \xe2\x80\x93 Barely edging out Nick Markakis for the starting nod (and I do mean barely), the former Oriole had become a b\xc3\xaate noir with O\xe2\x80\x99s fans for his antics toward Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day. And let\xe2\x80\x99s get this out of the way \xe2\x80\x93 he deserves to be here. He\xe2\x80\x99s second in among AL OF in WAR (Fangraphs and B-R agree), 2nd in OPS,  3rd in SLG, 3rd in HR, and 4th in OBP. His batting average isn\xe2\x80\x99t much to write home about \xe2\x80\x93 just .267 \xe2\x80\x93 but the man gets on base and hits some homers, too. THE AMERICAN LEAGUE RESERVES Manny Machado, Orioles (3B) - He leads MLB in doubles, third among AL 3B in batting average, and while he\'s just 6th in OPS using B-R.com among AL 3B, he\'s leading the AL in WAR using B-R.com.

Mariano Rivera throwing only one pitch is another.Rivera has carved out what will almost surely be a Hall of Fame career by predominantly throwing the cut fastball, or cutter. But ask any right-handed major league hitter who has played in the past several years, and he can verify that Rivera also throws a healthy number of two-seam fastballs.Last month, Rivera threw eight pitches to the Los Angeles Angels\xe2\x80\x99 dangerous right-handed sluggers Mike Trout and Albert Pujols in two tense at-bats. Seven of them were two-seamers, a pitch that tends to move in on right-handed hitters. Pujols struck out on three of them.As with the cutter, Rivera has had great success with the two-seamer over the past several years, including a stretch in June when he threw 25 fastballs out of 47 pitches, most of them to beefy right-handers looking for a cutter over the plate. On Sunday, Adam Jones was the one who had success with it. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      With one out in the ninth inning, Rivera, who wore his socks to his knees in support of David Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s All-Star candidacy, threw a two-seamer to Jones. The high socks were unusual; the two-seamer was not.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But the pitch did not get inside enough, and Jones drilled it into the center-field stands for a two-run homer that propelled the Baltimore Orioles to a 2-1 victory over the Yankees.The loss ended the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 winning streak at six and erased a masterly performance by Hiroki Kuroda, who shook off a minor hip injury to pitch seven scoreless innings, allowing three hits.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d Rivera said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a loss. The way Kuroda was pitching, he was doing outstanding. He was great, and I thought it would be a good game to save. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the other ones are not good to save. But this one should have been great, and I did that.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  It was the second blown save for Rivera in 31 chances this season and the 75th of his career, compared with 637 saves. It was also his first blown save at Yankee Stadium since 2011, a stretch in which he converted 41 straight opportunities here.

Credit             Barton Silverman/The New York Times           His last blown save was May 28 against the Mets. In that game, Rivera threw cutters to the left-hander Daniel Murphy, who doubled, and then three straight two-seam fastballs to the right-handed David Wright, who singled home the tying run.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been throwing two-seamers to me for about five years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vernon Wells, who had faced Rivera as a member of the Toronto Blue Jays and the Angels before joining the Yankees this year. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are both very tough pitches to hit.\xe2\x80\x9dYankees catcher Chris Stewart said he liked to call for the fastball when he noticed right-handers like Pujols looking out over the plate. According to Manager Joe Girardi, Rivera began throwing more fastballs to right-handers when teams sent up right-handed pinch-hitters to face him.

Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s cut fastball rides from right to left, in on the hands of left-handed hitters, whose bats sometimes break when the ball hits the thin part of the handle. When he throws the two-seamer, it tends to break the other way.But location is always the key with Rivera. Ichiro Suzuki, who once homered off a cutter from Rivera when he played for Seattle, pointed out that Rivera was an expert at locating the pitch to different points in the strike zone.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s cutter is really four pitches, according to the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 pitching coach, Larry Rothschild. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can throw it up and in, up and away, down and in and down and away,\xe2\x80\x9d Rothschild said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s got the two-seamer, people have to keep it in the back of their mind, too.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Even though he is regularly lauded for throwing only one pitch \xe2\x80\x94 Rivera learned the cutter in 1997 and threw it almost exclusively for the first portion of his career as a closer \xe2\x80\x94 Rivera does not go out of his way to correct that notion.\xe2\x80\x9cI love it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a laugh on the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 recent trip.In the ninth inning Sunday, he threw four pitches to Manny Machado, two fastballs and then two cutters, and got Machado to ground out. To Nick Markakis, he threw two cutters and then a fastball, and Markakis singled on the 0-2 pitch. Jones saw two fastballs.

At first, Robertson did not know why Rivera had gone with the look. Once he figured it out, he was pleased by the gesture, even if Rivera blew a save.\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very nice that he did that for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Robertson said. \xe2\x80\x9cI really appreciate it.\xe2\x80\x9d  A version of this article appears in print on July 8, 2013, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: Rare Time When Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s Second Best Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Good Enough.

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)MoreNEW YORK (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Chris Davis\' first-half power surge made him one popular All-Star.Baltimore\'s first baseman with the cool nickname ""Crush"" slugged his way past Detroit\'s Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera in the final week to claim the most fan votes in All-Star game balloting. Washington outfielder Bryce Harper used a final push to win a spot in the National League\'s starting lineup.Right-hander Max Scherzer was one of a major league-best six Tigers chosen for the All-Star game July 16 at Citi Field in New York. St. Louis catcher Yadier Molina led the NL fan vote announced Saturday night. He is one of the Cardinals\' five All-Stars, tops in the NL.""I think any time you are getting that recognition, not only from your fan base but from everybody across the nation, I think it feels good to know that people are watching,"" said Davis, one of 30 first-time All-Stars.Mets young ace Matt Harvey and third baseman David Wright will represent the host team in the 84th All-Star game. Harvey, a first timer, received the most votes among NL pitchers in the player balloting, outpacing the Dodgers\' Clayton Kershaw.Baseball\'s latest phenom, Cuban defector Yasiel Puig, didn\'t make the NL team \xe2\x80\x94 at least not yet. The Dodgers outfielder with just one breathless month in the big leagues is among five candidates for the final NL spot, with fans able to vote online through Thursday.""He\'s done a tremendous job since he\'s been up here and created a lot of interest throughout baseball with what he\'s accomplished,"" said Giants manager Bruce Bochy, who will lead the NL squad for the second time in three years. ""This gives him a chance to get voted on the club if the public thinks they want to see him there.""The league that wins the All-Star game gains home-field advantage in the World Series. The NL won the last three Midsummer Classics and World Series titles.Davis finished with 8,272,243 fan votes to edge Cabrera, who had 8,013,874. Davis has 85 RBIs, matching his career high and only three fewer than Cabrera. But he has hit 33 homers, seventh best before the break in big league history \xe2\x80\x94 he has a week to catch Barry Bond\'s 39.Davis is the second first-time All-Star to lead the voting, joining Seattle outfielder Ichiro Suzuki (2001).The 27-year-old Davis is one of three Orioles selected by the fans, the first time that has happened since Cal Ripken Jr. was one of the picks in 1997.Shortstop J.J. Hardy and center fielder Adam Jones will take the field with Davis. Baltimore third baseman Manny Machado was selected as a reserve.In the only close race for a starting role, the 20-year-old Harper trailed Justin Upton by several thousand votes, but he homered in his return from the disabled list this week and moved into the lead. Now Harper will become the youngest NL starter and fourth youngest overall to start in the game, according to the Nationals.""I\'m really looking forward to it and being around the top guys in baseball,"" Harper said.Fellow rookie of the year Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels was voted to his first All-Star start, too.Puig is joined in the final NL five by shortstop Ian Desmond of Washington, first basemen Freddie Freeman of Atlanta and Adrian Gonzalez of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and outfielder Hunter Pence of San Francisco.The American League\'s five are all relievers: Detroit\'s Joaquin Benoit, Toronto\'s Steve Delabar, the Yankees\' David Robertson, Texas\' Tanner Scheppers, and Boston\'s Koji Uehara.New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera was one of the 68 players selected chosen by fans, managers and big leaguers. The 43-year-old career saves leader will hop across town as part of his retirement tour for a 13th All-Star appearance, second most by a pitcher behind 17 for Hall of Famer Warren Spahn.""The fact that I went through all the adversity and I\'m standing here talking about the All-Star game ... it\'s a privilege,"" said Rivera, who has 29 saves this year after missing nearly all of last season with a torn knee ligament.While Yankees stars Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez are working their way back from injuries and will be absent in Queens, Robinson Cano was selected to his fourth straight start at second base.Scherzer is the first pitcher to start a season 13-0 since Roger Clemens in 1986.""If they give me the ball that would be pretty special to me,"" Scherzer said of starting. ""You look at how many other great pitchers who are in the game right now who are worthy of starting. If I\'m selected that would mean so much.""Scherzer was joined from Detroit by first baseman Prince Fielder, shortstop Jhonny Peralta, and outfielder Torii Hunter. Manager Jim Leyland, who will run the AL squad after leading Detroit to the World Series, picked his ace Justin Verlander for the team.""This is not a simple thing, but I\'m proud of it,"" Leyland said. ""We worked hard on it. We\'re not going to be perfect. I put a lot of time and thought into it. I had a lot of help. It\'s still not going to make everybody happy. There\'s going to be guys who should be All-Stars who are left off. That happens every year.""Third base was a talent-laden position, and one player left off the AL roster was Oakland\'s Josh Donaldson.

07/08/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles 5, Texas Rangers 8: Feldman implodes in ...', "" Stop me if you've heard this one before: Orioles pitcher starts the game looking great, goes five strong innings, then hits a wall and can't get anyone out. Scott Feldman was the latest Orioles pitcher to not be able to go deep into a game after starting the game strong, and the result was an ugly loss. Not helping matters was the Orioles offense who stranded, oh, a million base runners through the first four innings. Through the first three innings Feldman looked fantastic. He faced just six batters in the first two innings, and in the third a lead off single moved over to third thanks to two ground outs then scored on a single by Ian Kinsler. He had thrown just 39 pitches through three innings. The Orioles, meanwhile, were hitting Rangers starting pitcher Derek Holland hard but had nothing to show for it. In the first inning, Manny Machado and Adam Jones singled with one out, but both Chris Davis and Matt Wieters struck out to strand them. In the second inning J.J. Hardy singled with no outs and after Nate McLouth inexplicably bunted him over to second base, Hardy was stranded. And in the third inning, Nick Markakis and Machado singled to start the inning, but Jones popped out and, just as they did in the first inning, Davis and Wieters struck out to end the inning. So that was five runners stranded in the first three innings, and they certainly could have used a few of those runs later in the game.    In the top of the fourth inning Feldman gave up one more run, this one in an inning that was a bit rougher than the last. With one out the Rangers loaded the bases on a single, a double, and a hit by pitch. That brought Mitch Moreland to the plate, who hit a single to knock in the second run of the game. It looked like things were getting ready to unravel, but Elvis Andrus grounded into a double play (that second baseman Alexi Casilla turned a sweet play on) to end the inning.    Down two runs, the Orioles finally struck back in the bottom of the fourth. Hardy led off the inning with a four-pitch walk and a double from McLouth put runners on second and third. Brian Roberts hit a ground ball to the right side but the first baseman bobbled the throw. Hardy was running on contact and would have scored anyway, but the error allowed McLouth to score and Roberts to get to second. The next batter, Alexi Casilla, bunted Roberts to third. That's annoying, but it looked possible he was trying for a hit, and he is Alexi Casilla, so I'll allow it. Markakis couldn't knock Roberts in but Machado singled to left to get the RBI and put the Orioles on top 3-2.  The lead lasted one inning.    Feldman bounced back for a great fifth inning and ended it with just 70 pitches. He looked primed to go deep into the game, but he didn't get out of the sixth. It got ugly. With David Murphy and Adrian Beltre on base with one out, A.J. Pierzynski doubled. Murphy scored and runners were on second and third with one out. The Orioles intentionally walked Moreland to load the bases and perhaps set up a double play or at least a force at the plate for Andrus. It didn't work out that way as Andrus singled to right, knocking in Beltre. That was all she wrote for Feldman and Buck Showalter turned to lefty Troy Patton to try and stop the bleeding. He did not. The other Beltre, Engel Beltre, hit a cheap single to right field, I believe that's what the kids call BABIP'd. It resulted in another run scored. After the O's got the second out at the plate, Ian Kinsler's hit was decidedly NOT a cheap hit, a bases clearing double to left field. Murphy, the tenth batter of the inning, grounded out to end it, but the damage was bad: 6 runs on 6 hits and one intentional walk. The O's cut into the lead in the seventh inning thanks to an unlikely source. Adam Jones struck out but reached on a passed ball, and after Chris Davis struck out for the third time, Matt Wieters came to the plate. Do you remember, back before Wieters was terrible at hitting, when he'd sometimes have smooth, easy power to the opposite field? Well we got to see that again in this at bat. Wieters hit a deep fly ball to right center and easily cleared the fence and made the score 5-3. They put two more runners on thanks to Hardy's second hit of the day and a walk to Roberts, but pinch hitting Ryan Flaherty grounded out on the first pitch to end the inning and the rally. The homer gave me a little glimmer of hope, the thought that maybe the bats would wake up, but it wasn't meant to be. They went 1-2-3-4-5-6 (including Davis's fourth strikeout of the night) against Joakim Soria and Joe Nathan, starting the homestand off with a loss.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Series Preview: Baltimore Orioles vs. Texas Rangers, 8-11 ...', ' You can do a lot worse than a 2-4 road trip, but it was awfully frustrating to fall back into the pack in the division while Boston gained a couple of games. The Rangers aren\'t looking as intimidating as they often do, though, with a rookie and a TBA starting this week. Perhaps the O\'s can start their last homestand before the All-Star break with a series win. Monday, 8 July: Scott Feldman vs. Derek Holland    Career Numbers Feldman vs. Rangers Holland vs. O\'s   IP 7.0 25.1   ERA 0.00 3.55   FIP 2.67 3.25   Slash Line (Past Teams) .087/.125/.087 .216/.306/.320   Slash Line (Current Players) .127/.169/.200 .206/.280/.279     Scott Feldman\'s second start as an Oriole will be against the team with which he\'s spent most of his career. He\'s faced the Rangers once already this year, and he acquitted himself quite well, with seven shutout innings. The O\'s would certainly take that again. Holland has had some success against the O\'s in the past, and he\'s having the best year of his career so far, posting his lowest ERA yet (3.13), career-best strikeout and walk rates, and averaging over 6.5 IP per start. He\'s also a lefty. I suspect that Feldman\'s going to have to pitch well for the O\'s to have a shot at winning this one.    Maybe hot: Nick Markakis (1.007 OPS, 13 PA) Likely not: Adrian Beltre (.406 OPS, 21 PA); Adam Jones and J.J. Hardy (each with a .200 OPS in 10 PA)    Tuesday, 9 July: Wei-Yin Chen(?) vs. Martin Perez    Career Numbers Chen vs. Rangers Perez vs. O\'s   IP 7.2 -   ERA 1.17 -   FIP 2.18 -   Slash Line (Past Teams) .207/.233/.276 -   Slash Line (Current Players) .200/.200/.450 .000/.000/.000 (4 PA)     Zach Britton is currently listed as the starter for this game, but all indications are that Chen will be activated for Tuesday or Wednesday. Maybe everybody after Feldman will get moved around a day, rather than knocking Britton out of the rotation, but that seems unlikely, especially since the All-Star break shortly after this series will be giving all the pitchers several days\' rest. Chen could prove to be a tremendous boost to the rotation if he\'s completely healthy; he had a 3.04 ERA before getting injured, though I\'d feel better about his peripherals if he started striking more people out. That\'s nit-picking, though; the guy might immediately be the O\'s best starter upon activation.    Martin Perez will start this one for the Rangers. He\'s a 22-year-old lefty who gets groundballs at a solid clip and is currently sporting a 1.85 ERA after four starts. Perez has a very low strikeout rate (4.44 K/9) and a very high line-drive rate (32.1%), though; much of his success comes from a very high left-on-base percentage (82.8%; league average is 73%) and a low home run rate (5.9% HR/FB; league average is ~10%). Best guess is that he\'ll have to find some strikeout stuff to have success against the O\'s, because you don\'t want a team with their kind of power to be hitting lots of line drives. Wednesday, 10 July: Miguel Gonzalez vs. TBA   Career Numbers Gonzalez vs. Rangers -   IP 5.0 -   ERA 7.20 -   FIP 4.70 -   Slash Line (Past Teams) .381/.462/.476 -   Slash Line (Current Players) .467/.550/.600 -     Miguel Gonzalez faced the Rangers once last year and struggled, giving up eight hits and three walks in five innings. That probably doesn\'t mean much, of course. His last two starts have been strange: against the Yankees, he gave up just one run in six innings with five walks to four strikeouts, but against the Indians he allowed three runs over 6.2 IP despite walking none and striking out nine. Baseball\'s a funny game sometimes, but I\'ll take my chances with the nine-strikeout-zero-walk start and bet on fewer balls falling in for hits. Opposing Gonzalez will be TBA - yes, other teams have him too, from time to time. Supposedly, this will be either Ross Wolf or Josh Lindblom, neither of whom has ever pitched against the Orioles (or accumulated more than a couple of PA against any current O\'s hitter). Wolf is a thirty-year-old journeyman who\'s appeared in the majors in 2007, 2010, and 2013 and has just 52.1 career innings, most as a reliever, while Lindblom is a few years younger and has more innings, but also has most of his major-league experience in the bullpen. Thursday, 11 July: Chris Tillman vs. Yu Darvish    Career Numbers Tillman vs. Rangers Darvish vs. O\'s   IP 20.0 -   ERA 3.60 -   FIP 4.40 -   Slash Line (Past Teams) .205/.256/.356 -   Slash Line (Current Players) .261/.320/.500 .333/.333/.333     Tillman couldn\'t carry his June success over to his last start, as he was singled to death by the Yankees and gave up five runs in 5.1 innings. He\'s done okay against the Rangers in the past; the slash line for current players is a bit concerning, but it\'s about what you\'d expect from Tillman against a team like the Rangers: slightly low OBP, lots of homers. There\'s a glimmer of hope on that front: Chris has been much less homer-prone since the end of May, with no multi-homer games and an overall HR/9 of 0.85. He seems to have traded throwing meatballs over the plate for a greater willingness to walk batters during that time, with a rather high 3.83 BB/9. If that\'s an improvement, it seems a bit like ""out of the fire, into the frying pan,"" to reverse an idiom. Darvish has never made a start against the O\'s in the regular season (that line above is Alexi Casilla\'s one hit in three PA), but did pretty well against them in that memorable Wild Card game last year, despite taking the loss. He\'s even better this year than he was last year, striking out more and walking fewer, though he is a bit more homer-prone. Basically, if the O\'s were to win the first three games of this series but fail to sweep, I would not complain one bit in this instance. No one can explain what Paul Blair had that gave him the ability to run and run and then know exactly where the ball was coming down. That\'s something that can\'t be learned... But some things can be learned. The outfielder\'s first responsibility is to get to the ball. Don\'t take it easy and then try to reach back and make a catch over your shoulder... The good outfielder runs hard until he\'s under the ball, plants his feet, and makes the safe catch. - Earl Weaver  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

', 'www.nytimes.com'), (""Baltimore Orioles 4, Texas Rangers 8: Adrian Beltre's big ..."", "" The Baltimore Orioles lost tonight, 8-4. Since sweeping the Yankees two weekends ago, they have gone 2-6. It's not the end of the world, not even close, but it's getting hard to watch. On their most recent road trip their offense was slumping while the starting pitching was, for the most part, improved. So at least we had that to cling to. In the last two games against the Rangers, however, the starting pitching has also abandoned the team.  I feel like I should just set up a template for recaps that details how a pitcher started a game off well only to have one fall apart inning the led to the loss. Tonight, that fall apart inning was the fifth for Zach Britton. Through four innings he had faced sixteen batters and the only run on the board was on a solo home run from Adrian Beltre. Britton did let runners on, but thanks to his ground ball was able to turn two double plays in those four innings.  The Orioles scored one run each in the second and third innings to give the Orioles a brief 2-1 lead. In the second, back-to-back-to-back two-out singles from Matt Wieters, Nate McLouth, and Brian Roberts resulted in the first run. And in the third, Manny Machado hit his seventh home run of the season, a line drive to left field that landed about five rows back.  So, about that fifth inning. Britton retired Robinson Chirinos for the first out, but then walked number nine hitter Leonys Martin. He continues to struggle with walks even on his good days. The O's caught a break when Martin tried to steal as Britton was throwing over to first. Chris Davis fired down to second base to get the second out. Britton started 0-2 on the next batter, Ian Kinsler, and was THIS close to getting out of the inning. But Kinsler singled and Britton walked the next batter, Jurickson Profar. Walks are the most frustrating, especially when they come in front of batters like Nelson Cruz and Beltre.    Cruz singled through the left side, just beyond the reach of both Machado and J.J. Hardy. A few inches either way and it could have been the third out, but that's how it goes. That's why you probably shouldn't walk two batters in an inning. Beltre took ball one but then hit the second pitch out for his second home run of the night. It capped off the four-run inning and put the Orioles in a three-run hole.  It looked like the O's might bounce back though, thanks to some shoddy defense from the Rangers. Both Nolan Reimold and Nick Markakis reached on errors to start the bottom of the fifth. Unfortunately after the Rangers gifted the O's runners, Machado popped out on the first pitch and Adam Jones struck out swinging. Adam is just ice cold right now, it's hard to watch. Davis is also cold but it didn't matter this time as he was hit by a pitch to load the bases. With two down, Hardy came through in the clutch with a single to left field that knocked in both Reimold and Markakis, and just like that they were only down one run.  Unfortunately, they didn't score any more runs. In innings six through nine they had just one base runner on a walk by Markakis. But he was called out due to catcher's interference. He ran on the pitch as Machado took a called strike three. The umpire said that Machado was in the way of A.J. Pierzynski being able to throw down to second. That's just the kind of game it was.     The Rangers added two runs in the seventh, both charged to Kevin Gausman (although Matusz allowed the second run to score after replacing him). Darren O'Day gave up the final run in the 9th on hits by Cruz and Beltre.

The Rangers took a 4-3 lead on Feldman and scored four more after Troy Patton entered with the bases loaded. The Orioles offense went down 1-2-3 in the bottom half of the inning.The sixth-inning struggles are nothing new for the Orioles. It has been their least-successful inning in 2013.The Orioles have been outscored, 69-40, in the sixth inning this season. That\xe2\x80\x99s a run differential of minus-29. Monday\xe2\x80\x99s game was the fourth in which they lost a lead in that inning. var adSkipCounter = 0; After giving up six sixth-inning runs to the Rangers on Monday night, the Orioles are allowing an average of 0.77 runs in the sixth inning, according to Baseball Reference. Their 69 runs allowed in that inning are their most in any inning. They have allowed 62, second-most, in the fourth. Their best inning has been the eighth, having allowed 26 in just 90 games.Offensively, the Orioles are averaging 0.44 runs scored in the sixth, their second-lowest inning behind the fifth. Their best inning, not counting free baseball, has been the seventh.I can\xe2\x80\x99t really think of a good possible explanation for the offensive struggles in the sixth inning, but I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing the reason they have allowed more runs in the sixth inning than any other inning is that it is often when their starters run out of steam, as was the case with Feldman in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s 8-5 loss and Chris Tillman in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s loss to the New York Yankees. The Orioles are 21st in baseball with 41 quality starts.There is a silver lining to this post, though. The Orioles have been good in the seventh, eighth and ninth, outscoring their opponents by 28 runs in those innings.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The way Adrian Beltre has been hitting the baseball lately, it seems hard to imagine he recently endured 22 straight games without a home run.Beltre went 4 for 4 with two homers and a season-high five RBIs to help the surging Texas Rangers beat the Baltimore Orioles 8-4 Tuesday night.Beltre hit a solo shot in the second inning and a three-run drive in the fifth, both off Zach Britton (2-3). Beltre has six home runs in his last six games and is batting .488 (21 for 43) during an 11-game hitting streak that began on June 28.He also singled in the fourth, received an intentional walk in the seventh and delivered an RBI single in the ninth. The two homers gave him 20 for the season and put him in a tie with teammate Lance Berkman for 74th on the career list with 366, according to the Rangers.Before his current power surge, Beltre went from June 10 to July 3 without launching a ball out of the park. It was his longest home-run drought since he joined the Rangers in 2011.""He\'s been hot and cold and he\'s picked it up again. He picked it up at the right time,"" Rangers manager Ron Washington said. ""When Adrian is getting it done it usually relaxes everybody else. That is what the big guy does in the middle of the lineup.""With Beltre leading the way, Texas has won 14 of 19 to move a season-high 16 games over .500 (53-37) \xe2\x80\x94 tied for the second-best record in franchise history after 90 games. The Rangers have scored at least five runs in six straight games and have won four in a row on the road.""We were having trouble driving in runs and all of a sudden Adrian started driving them in and everybody started relaxing,"" Washington said. ""Now we\'re putting runs on the board. I hope it can continue.""Beltre said, ""We all contribute some way or another. I think we are good as a group. There\'s not one guy who can say he\'s the main guy. I think everybody\'s contributing right now. There\'s a couple games that I\'m contributing a lot better than I did before.""Manny Machado homered for the Orioles, who have lost six of eight. Baltimore is 3-12 in its last 15 regular-season games against Texas.After going 1 for 12 with runners in scoring position in a loss to Texas on Monday, the Orioles were 2 for 7 in that situation on Tuesday. Their biggest problem on this night was containing Beltre.""You know he\'s a good hitter, and then when you make bad pitches on top of that he\'s not going to miss them,"" manager Buck Showalter said.Britton gave up five runs and eight hits in five innings. After the game, he was optioned along with reliever Kevin Gausman to Triple-A Norfolk. The corresponding moves will be announced Wednesday, with one of them being the activation of left-hander Wei-Yin Chen from the disabled list.Martin Perez (3-1) allowed four runs, two earned, and six hits in six-plus innings for the Rangers. The left-hander is 3-0 with a 1.44 ERA in four starts since being recalled from Triple-A Round Rock on June 22.""I can\'t finish the seventh inning but I\'m happy what I\'m doing tonight,"" Perez said.Perez, who came in with a run of 17 straight scoreless innings, added to the total with a perfect first. But the streak ended in the second when the Orioles used singles by Matt Wieters, Nate McLouth and Brian Roberts to pull even at 1.Machado hit a solo drive in the third, his seventh of the season and only the second since May 5.Texas went up 5-2 in the fifth. After Nelson Cruz singled in a run, Beltre hit a shot into the left-field seats for his 25th career multihomer game.""I was looking for a pitch up in the zone that I could drive, and that\'s what I got,"" he said.The Orioles closed to 5-4 in their half of the fifth. Two botched grounders preceded a two-out, two-run single by J.J. Hardy.The Rangers added two runs in seventh. Leonys Martin walked and scored on a double by Jurickson Profar, and A.J.

Batting ninth in the order, Reimold delivered his first home run since May 4 to put Baltimore up 6-0 in the fourth inning against Josh Lindblom (1-3).Reimold was on the disabled list from May 12 to July 1 and was playing in only his 37th game of the season.""It felt good that I was able to come through,"" he said. ""Something to build on.""Lindblom gave up six runs, nine hits and four walks in 5 1-3 innings. The right-hander started for Nick Tepesch, who went on the disabled list Sunday.""I compete, and really I think that\'s all you try and do as a starter,"" said Lindblom, who has split time between the rotation and bullpen.

Darvish was scheduled to start Thursday night; he will be replaced by Ross Wolf.The Orioles used a four-run fourth to take a 6-0 lead. Lindblom walked the first two batters before Brian Roberts hit a liner to center that bounced out of the glove of Engel Beltre and off the wall. It went for an RBI single, and Reimold followed with a towering fly ball that carried into the left-field seats, a few feet inside the foul pole.Texas got its lone run in the sixth when Ian Kinsler walked, took third on a single by Nelson Cruz and scored when Beltre hit into a fielder\'s choice.Chen used 21 pitches in a 1-2-3 first inning, and Lindblom needed 31 to get through a bottom half in which the Orioles got two singles.Baltimore went up 2-0 in the third.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. ', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('A History of the Orioles All-Stars - Camden Chat', "" The Orioles will have three starters -- Chris Davis, J.J. Hardy and Adam Jones -- in the 2013 All-Star Game in New York.  No other team in the AL has more than one this year, which makes it pretty special for Baltimore.  It hasn't always been this way.  Before last year's breakout season, the Orioles hadn't had more than one All-Star -- in many cases a token bench player or reliever -- since 2005.  And 2012 and 2013 mark the first consecutive years with multiple All-Stars since 1999 and 2000.  Looking over the all-time list of Orioles all-stars (which actually has some inaccuracies in earlier years, according to MLB and Baseball Reference, but is a quick Orioles-centric list nonetheless) provides some moments of pride and some moments of cringing.  Let's take a closer look at some of those. The Orioles had an absolute powerhouse run in the All-Star game from 1969-1972, with six or seven All-Stars and two or more starters each year.  Looking at some of the names in that span -- Jim Palmer, Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson, Boog Powell -- tells you why.  These were some of the golden years of the Orioles franchise.  They were not, unfortunately, golden years for the AL in the midsummer classic, in the midst of a 20-year stretch where the AL won only once.  But that one time -- 1971 -- saw Frank Robinson win the All-Star MVP award, belting an early two-run blast as part of a home run onslaught that also included Reggie Jackson and Harmon Killebrew. Cal Ripken Jr. made every single All-Star team from 1983 to 2001.  If Orioles fans complain now about aging stars getting into the game on name recognition alone, we should probably accept a bit of historical karma.  From 1992 onward, Ripken only put up an OPS+ above 100 three times, and really only his resurgent 1999 season was anywhere near All-Star caliber.  But let's not dwell on all that.  Let's dwell on the truly deserved perennial All-Star status that Ripken enjoyed for the first decade of his career.  Since Ripken's run ended, the longest run by an Orioles is Miguel Tejada's three appearances from 2004-06, only one of which was as a starter. Orioles pitchers do not have a recent history of being picked to start the All-Star Game.  From 1965 to 1980, three pitchers (Milt Pappas, Jim Palmer [x4!], and Steve Stone) were picked to start the midsummer classic six times.  None have been selected since -- which really surprised me with some of the elite seasons Mike Mussina logged in the mid-1990s.  But it didn't really surprise me for anybody since then.    In the recent past, the Orioles have suffered through some years where they were granted a token All-Star rep almost certainly for no reason other than the requirement that every team have an All-Star.  You can usually pick these guys out because they either play multiple positions or provide a steady relief pitching option -- so names like Ty Wigginton (2010), George Sherril (2008) and Tony Batista (2002) jump right off the page in this regard. A blip in the not-so-magnanimous All-Star representation of the 2000s was the Orioles star-crossed 2005 season.  This was the year the Orioles entered the All-Star break at 47-40 (even though they would finish at just 74-88) -- but that shining first half netted All-Star appearances for Tejada, Brian Roberts, Melvin Mora and B.J. Ryan, with Roberts and Tejada given the starting nod.  That All-Star Game's flash of orange was just one of many shining moments that made the utter collapse that followed so painful. But 2005 is over and gone.  The Orioles are building something more lasting now, and the number of solid hitters right in the thick of their prime years is reflected in the solid All-Star crop they've had for two years running now.  The question marks dotting the starting rotation, unfortunately, are also reflected in the lack of orange in the All-Star pitching roster, but hey, no one can have it all.  Orioles fans can certainly hope that this is the second year of another decent stretch of perennial Birdland representation at the midsummer classic.     "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

But his stock dropped due to perceived bonus demands and a college commitment to Western Michigan University. var adSkipCounter = 0; According to a source, Ayers has agreed to a $200,000 bonus -- double the suggested slot for anyone after the 10th round and roughly the equivalent of a high seventh-round pick -- pending physical, which was scheduled for Thursday.The Orioles also recently signed 32nd-round selection Max Homick, a left-hander out of the University of San Diego.The club is now basically done in its pursuit of draft picks this year, according to scouting director Gary Rajsich. They have signed 32 of 41 selections, including 19 of their top 21.The only two in their top 21 they are not expected to sign before Friday are 15th rounder Tyler Walsh, a prep infielder who likely will attend Belmont University in Tennessee, and 18th rounder Reed Reilly, a right-hander from Cal Poly, who has decided to return to school.The Orioles have selected 21 players in the top 10 rounds in the past two years, and have failed to sign just one, left-hander Colin Poche, a fifth-rounder in 2012.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really happy about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Rajsich said. \xe2\x80\x9c(The signings) are a combination of the new CBA rules and our scouts doing a great job of getting the players\xe2\x80\x99 signability information.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles had their top 10 picks locked down early this year with only seventh-rounder Drew Dosch not signed soon after the draft. Dosch, a third baseman out of Youngstown State, has passed his physical after agreeing to a $218,500 bonus -- which is slot for a sixth-rounder. The suggested bonus for Dosch, who is recovering from anterior cruciate ligament surgery in his right knee and will not play in 2013, was $163,800.Of the club\xe2\x80\x99s top 10 round picks, only Dosch and sixth-rounder Alex Murphy, a catcher from Calvert Hall who signed at $275,000 instead of the slotted $218,500, exceeded their slotted bonuses. Only two others -- 12th rounder Jake Bray, a right-hander from a California Junior College and Ayers -- received above slot bonuses: $200,000 instead of the $100,000 allowed for 11th rounders and beyond.Several of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 top draft picks signed early enough to already be in action.Supplemental first rounder Josh Hart, an outfielder, and second rounder Chance Sisco, a catcher, have already played seven games for the Gulf Coast League Orioles heading into Thursday. Hart is hitting .240 with a .367 on-base percentage and Sisco is hitting .375 with a .429 on-base percentage.First rounder Hunter Harvey is expected to make his professional debut with the Gulf Coast League Orioles next week.\xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99re very happy with the draft this year,\xe2\x80\x9d Rajsich said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re happy with the way the players cane off the board. We have some bigger, stronger athletes who like to play and I think the future is bright as far as restocking the system with talent.\xe2\x80\x9d     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

But I like our chances a lot better with him here.\xe2\x80\x9dChen may actually be going back to the minors \xe2\x80\x93 for one start anyway.He\xe2\x80\x99s pitched just three times since May 12 because of the oblique injury: two minor league rehab games at Double-A Bowie and his return to the Orioles on Wednesday.More than anyone else, Chen needs to keep pitching. And if that means optioning him to Frederick to pitch July 15 (or the 16th on the road in Altoona for Bowie) and stay on turn for July 21 or July 22 for the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 then that\xe2\x80\x99s what has to happen.Showalter and company are great when it comes to thinking big picture. And a brief demotion to keep Chen moving forward is probably the best for his long-term survival in the second half.\xe2\x80\x9cTo be frank with you, yes we are [considering it],\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t know if we\'re going to or not, but we talked about it during the day and decided to wait and see how he looked and then we talked about it a little bit before I came down here [after the game] and we\'ll talk about it a little bit more. We can option him. I\'m not saying we\'re going to.\xe2\x80\x9d** Cameras caught Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson in a suite Wednesday enjoying the game. When he was put up on the big screen above right center, Robinson received a rousing ovation from the fans.And that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost on Showalter \xe2\x80\x93 who really has embraced the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 tradition and past successes.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s always a special significance. I stopped whatever I was doing and watched. I love watching. Brooks is one of the treasures of baseball, let alone the Orioles,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s special. We\xe2\x80\x99re so lucky to have him show up here. To think that Brooks Robinson thought the most important thing today was to come watch us play, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool. If we had played really bad tonight, that would have been a really tough thing to live with.\xe2\x80\x9d** Hey, in case you didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice, the Orioles know how to walk. They received a season-high seven free passes Wednesday.They had walked six times in four different games this year. But here\xe2\x80\x99s the kicker: None of those games came after April 30. So they walked six times in four different games in April, and then not again until last night.Being aggressive is great when you\xe2\x80\x99re homering, but when the home runs go dry, you need to score runs in other ways. And one way is taking what is given to you. The Orioles had entered Wednesday 27th of 30 teams in the majors in walks. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not acceptable for a contending team.\xc2\xa0 Showalter hinted Wednesday that he made that very apparent to his team recently.\xc2\xa0** The Orioles lost the first two games of their series with Texas on the big inning. Monday night, the Rangers posted a six-run sixth. Tuesday, it was a four-run fifth. Both times, it was too much of a deficit to make up for a struggling offense.Wednesday night, the Orioles finally got their big inning \xe2\x80\x94 and a win.Thanks to an RBI single off the top of the right-center field wall by second baseman Brian Roberts and a three-run home run by left fielder Nolan Reimold down the left field line in the fourth, the Orioles had their first four-run inning since posting two in their 11-3 win over the New York Yankees on June 29.And it was enough breathing room behind left-hander Wei-Yin Chen\xe2\x80\x99s performance.\xe2\x80\x9cYou win a lot of games with the big innings,\xe2\x80\x9d catcher Matt Wieters said. \xe2\x80\x9cOn defense you\xe2\x80\x99re going to want to try to stop the big inning, and on offense you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get a couple because it definitely helps your chances of winning a game.\xe2\x80\x9d     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

07/13/2013,"[('Birds Watcher: Davis hits 35 in Orioles\\u2019 win', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure when the rest of the league realized that it had a problem with Chris Davis and the Baltimore Orioles, but\xe2\x80\xa6they do. In last night\xe2\x80\x99s 8-5 win over Toronto Davis hit his 35th home run of what could be a historic season. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that necessarily to mean Davis will challenge Barry Bonds\xe2\x80\x98 record of 70 homers in a season. However there are numerous Oriole team records that might well fall this season if Davis keeps up this pace. In fact, Davis has now passed Boog Powell who previously held the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 record for most RBI prior to the all-star game. Powell recorded 86 in 1969, and Davis passed that on his way to 88 last night.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsChris Tillman won his 11th game of the season for the Birds last night. Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 8 H, 3 R, 1 BB, 5 K. However Toronto took an early lead in the second inning when J.P. Arencibia shot a tw0-run homer into the seats. However Davis\xe2\x80\x99 aforementioned 35th home run tied the game at two in the last of the inning, only to have Juan Encarnacion send a solo shot into the seats in the third. It appeared at that point that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cone of those nights\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that the ball was flying out of the yard. However by that I mean that it appeared the two teams would be trading blows one-by-one. That was furthered in the last of the third when Adam Jones gave the Orioles the lead with a three-run homer.However Toronto bats quieted off after that. The O\xe2\x80\x99s still had some power left in them however, as J.J. Hardy sent a shot over the wall in left for a three-run homer and an 8-3 Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead. Adam Lind would double home two Toronto runs in the ninth to make the score 8-5, however it was to no avail as the O\xe2\x80\x99s were all over their Canadian counterparts in this one.Prior to the game the Orioles DFA\xe2\x80\x99d Jair Jurrjens off the 40-man roster, and purchased the contract of Jair Asencio who ended up making his 2013 major league debut in the game (in relief). The one concern from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint is that they ended up having to use four relievers in the game, which might put the \xe2\x80\x98pen in a bit of a pickle for the rest of the weekend. However it might be worth saying that this is a sort of \xe2\x80\x9call hands on deck\xe2\x80\x9d type of weekend for the Orioles given that the entire team (with the exception of Jones, Davis, Hardy, and Machado) will have most of next week off with the all-star break being upon us after tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s game.The series continues today with a late afternoon matinee at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will send Jason Hammel to the mound for his final start of the first half, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Todd Redmon of Toronto. It\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat important to note when talking about guys\xe2\x80\x99 first half numbers that the first half was a bit longer this year than in the past. Normally the all-star break was the second week in July; this year it\xe2\x80\x99s the third. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Tom McNamara, the Seattle Mariners\xe2\x80\x99 scouting director, said the more competitive events offer the chance to see players against better opponents, often with wood bats. High school players, he said, are far more refined than they were a decade ago.\xe2\x80\x9cThe college players might be getting to the big leagues first, but the high school kids are more impactful,\xe2\x80\x9d McNamara said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can just look all around baseball. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to sign high school players now than it was 10 years ago. The fear of signing a pro contract, it\xe2\x80\x99s not there anymore. The minor leagues are different. The prospects are taken care of so much better; the facilities are better; the parents are more educated. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, here\xe2\x80\x99s a bonus; get on a bus.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s more structured.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The trend might be cyclical, or it might not be a trend at all. Think of the talent influx in the mid-1980s, when Dwight Gooden, Roger Clemens and Kirby Puckett hit the scene, or the mid-1990s, with Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and Nomar Garciaparra.

According to Major League Baseball, 5 of the 20 top-selling jerseys this season are for players under age 24: Harper, Harvey, Machado, Trout and Yasiel Puig. Only 2 of the top 20 jerseys were for players over 30: the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera.\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like the young generation\xe2\x80\x99s definitely starting to make a bigger impact in the game,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jesse Biddle, a Class AA pitcher for the Phillies. \xe2\x80\x9cSmall ball\xe2\x80\x99s starting to become a big deal. Stealing bases, bunting, hit-and-run \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s all coming back. The game\xe2\x80\x99s starting to go back to the way it used to be played.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Fans of the Phillies are closely tracking Biddle\xe2\x80\x99s progress. He was born in Philadelphia and raised on the Phillies, now an aging team with injury problems in a young division. Biddle got four outs Sunday without allowing a run, earning the win in a 4-2 United States victory.If Biddle is one of those few special talents, the kind the sage of his organization will travel across the country to see, he should be in the majors before long. Once they reach the Futures Game, players do not expect to see much more of the minors.\xe2\x80\x9cI was just trying to enjoy the experience,\xe2\x80\x9d Yelich said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s probably my last one.\xe2\x80\x9d  A version of this article appears in print on July 15, 2013, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Future Is Now for Top Young Stars.

At the All-Star break this year, the Orioles will have 96 games in the books, with 66 yet to play. But in any event, what will be the critical elements for the Baltimore Orioles to return to the playoffs?1.\xc2\xa0 A Stabilized Starting RotationThere is not an Orioles writer anywhere who will this week not be listing this pitching item as the #1 component for second half success. The Birds are proving the axiomatic truth that even if you have the best offense, it is difficult to win consistently without good starting pitching.Exclamation Marks \xe2\x80\x93 Fans can feel pretty good about three of the current starters in the rotation. Wei-Yin Chen is back and is looking fully recovered and fresh from the prior injury. And Chris Tillman and Miguel Gonzalez very consistently are providing good starts. Since July 4th of last year, Tillman is 20-6 and Gonzalez is 16-7. That is impressive.Question Marks \xe2\x80\x93 Jason Hammel has battled injuries and a variety of circumstances in an attempt to return to the form of 2012. Though glimpses of the guy we remember are seen, more balls fly over the fence, and a bad pitch or two here and there turns the game around. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 management hopes that Scott Feldman \xe2\x80\x93 acquired in the trade of Jake Arrieta \xe2\x80\x93 will prove to be a steady force every fifth game. His seasonal stats, while not amazing, would seem to portend such success \xe2\x80\xa6 though his two starts so far for the Orioles have also been well short of amazing.2.\xc2\xa0 A Revitalized BullpenBaseball pundits everywhere said that the Orioles could never repeat the 2012 success in one-run games, games won when leading after seven innings, and in total bullpen performance. This has sadly turned out to be true. I don\xe2\x80\x99t particularly subscribe to the \xe2\x80\x9cover-worked bullpen\xe2\x80\x9d theory \xe2\x80\x93 that the inability of the starters to go deep into games causes the bullpen to grow fatigued and therefore be less effective. I believe they have simply not been as good; and really, who could expect them to be? There is still plenty of talent in that pen, and they seem to be (mostly) returning to the kind of form one would expect.The most critical piece of this revitalization is Jim Johnson. Though still leading the league in saves, the fact is that he has not been nearly as effective as last year. He has struggled much with command and single-handedly cost the Orioles a number of wins. Johnson is on pace to blow 10 saves and lose 11 games, and those are inconceivably disastrous numbers for a contending team.3.\xc2\xa0 Plugging Some Holes in the DikeJul 11, 2013; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles second baseman Brian Roberts (1) is congratulated by Nolan Reimold (14) after hitting a solo home run in the third inning against the Texas Rangers at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsA Small Hole \xe2\x80\x93 The Orioles have a powerful lineup with little relief through six or seven of the spots in the batting order. Though Matt Wieters is the probable best defensive catcher in the game today, his offensive production is well below expectations. I am far from the only one to speculate that he is playing with more than his fair share of bumps and bruises from donning the tools of ignorance. He often grimaces on swings and pauses to stretch. Orioles fans should be thankful he will be able to rest over the All Star break.A Medium Hole \xe2\x80\x93 There has been a rotating cast of characters at second base \xe2\x80\x93 all of them combining to have the lowest offensive production in the league for this position. But \xe2\x80\x93 and it\xe2\x80\x99s a big \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x9d (no, not referencing a derriere) \xe2\x80\x93 there is now the return of Brian Roberts. Though it is going to take some extended time for fans to believe a corner has truly been turned, the early returns are encouraging. He has been making all the plays in the field as in the past, and as I write this on Saturday while the game is in process, he has turned on two pitches and drilled them hard for doubles.A Big Hole \xe2\x80\x93 Also at the bottom of the league are the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 stats for designated hitter. Even more characters have attempted to be the answer in this role \xe2\x80\x93 with very limited results. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is Nolan Reimold. Along with hitting best only when he plays the field, he has not come through very well in DH opportunities. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been among Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s loudest and most ardent fans and must say it does not look like he is himself physically \xe2\x80\x93 which is the rap on him as an always-injured dude. Fans have really lost patience with him, and his days may be getting shorter.4.\xc2\xa0 Retaining the Strengths of the First HalfGreat Defense \xe2\x80\x93 The Orioles have almost certainly the best defense in the game \xe2\x80\x93 starting five gold-glovers and a fellow named Manny Machado. There really are no holes. One could maybe say that Davis is pretty average at first base, but everyone else is among the very best, if not the best at their position.Powerful Offense \xe2\x80\x93 Though good pitching sometimes shuts down the Orioles hitting, it is difficult to fault with what has been a powerful season of production from the lineup. It is great fun for fans to hear Elias Sports Bureau statistics about this and that \xe2\x80\x93 usually centered around Chris Davis in tandem with Machado \xe2\x80\x93 detailing how \xe2\x80\x9c_________ has not been done since ____\xe2\x80\x9d and then come names like Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Roger Maris, or Ted Williams. There would seem to be no reason why this team should not continue to be a powerful offense throughout the remainder of the season.5.\xc2\xa0 Some Help from Just Over the Horizon?Trades? \xe2\x80\x93 The Orioles would appear to be the classic team looking to add pieces \xe2\x80\x93 most likely starting pitching \xe2\x80\x93 before the trade deadline. Will Duquette do it?Young Pitching? \xe2\x80\x93 Kevin Gausman could imaginably grow in his skills to yet be a piece in the second half. He has not thrown too many innings for a young guy, and if someone falters (which is very imaginable) Gausman might end up in the rotation.Defection Connection? \xe2\x80\x93 Perhaps the most intriguing possible addition is Cuban defector Henry Urrutia. He has blown away pitching at both AA and AAA in this his first year back in baseball after time away dealing with status issues. What else is there for him to do? And with DH problems, could we see a similar \xe2\x80\x9csea change effect\xe2\x80\x9d like Machado provided in 2012?\xc2\xa0 Put me down as \xe2\x80\x9ccalling\xe2\x80\x9d for this to happen.6.\xc2\xa0 Intangibles The Orioles have in Buck Showalter one of the premier managers in the game. He is a players\xe2\x80\x99 manager and has shown over his tenure to be especially adept at pulling the right strings at every turn over the final third of a season. Along with that, the Orioles have the rare experience of a unified, loyal, team-focused, peaceful clubhouse. This is a group that enjoys being together, winning together, and turning the page quickly after inevitable loses.Final WordIt remains a challenge for the Orioles to return to the playoffs. While certainly an improved team, they play in the best division in baseball. There are more than a couple things that need to go well over the final 66 games. But it is imaginable, and I\xe2\x80\x99d give it odds of 50-50. They are going to need to log about 94 wins or more to do it, and currently they are on a pace to win 89. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
07/15/2013,"[('3 Baltimore Orioles Players Will Start In The All-Star Game', ' NEW YORK (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Mets ace Matt Harvey will start Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s All-Star game on his home mound at New York\xe2\x80\x99s Citi Field, and the Detroit Tigers\xe2\x80\x99 Max Scherzer will open for the American League. Harvey will be the first pitcher from the host team to start an All-Star game since Houston\xe2\x80\x99s Roger Clemens in 2004 and just the 11th overall. NL manager Bruce Bochy\xe2\x80\x99s starting lineup announced Monday has Cincinnati second baseman Brandon Phillips leading off, followed by St. Louis right fielder Carlos Beltran, Reds first baseman Joey Votto, Mets third baseman David Wright, Colorado left fielder Carlos Gonzalez, Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina, Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, Colorado designated hitter Michael Cuddyer and Washington center fielder Bryce Harper. AL manager Jim Leyland has the Los Angeles Angels\xe2\x80\x99 Mike Trout in left field and leading off, followed by New York Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano, Detroit third baseman Miguel Cabrera, Baltimore first baseman Chris Davis, Toronto right fielder Jose Bautista, Boston designated hitter David Ortiz, Orioles center fielder Adam Jones, Minnesota catcher Joe Mauer and Baltimore shortstop J.J. Hardy. The 24-year-old Harvey, 7-2 with a 2.35 ERA and an NL-high 147 strikeouts, will become the youngest All-Star starting pitcher since the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 Dwight Gooden in 1988, when he was 23. Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s Justin Verlander was the AL starter and loser last year. Scherzer (13-1, 3.10 ERA) joins him to become the first pitchers from the same club to start consecutive All-Star games since Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Randy Johnson (2000-01) and Curt Schilling (2002). Scherzer was 13-0 before losing Saturday to Texas. He had most wins in a perfect start since Clemens won his first 14 decisions in 1986. (Copyright 2013 by The Associated Press.

Believe it or not I just forgot, or maybe ran out of time, or maybe both plus the fact that my GIF tastes lean toward the absurd, peculiar, silly, and interesting moments that aren\'t necessarily great sports plays. I can find those web gems elsewhere on the web, thank you very much! But, I must acknowledge that some plays are memorable enough that the GIF must be made. So here it is. In this case it was made by Gordon Dixon, and I found it floating around the internet. It looked pretty much just right with slo-mo at the end to see that it was definitely an out. Can\'t improve on that much.

Despite being the leading vote-getter in the American League and starting Tuesday\'s game at first base, Davis says the Derby is the best part of the All-Star festivities.""As a young kid, I watched it all the time. It\'s something that I\'ve always wanted to be a part of and now that I\'m here and going to be a part of it, it\'s kind of surreal,"" he says.Davis has always been the kind of boom-and-bust hitter the Derby is designed to showcase.Before the Orioles acquired him two seasons ago in a trade deadline deal with the Texas Rangers, the boom took place mostly in the minor leagues while the busts came after he was promoted to the majors.With Texas, he was a .252 hitter who struck out in nearly one-third of his plate appearances. But over six seasons in the minors, he hit .318 (with a .597 slugging percentage) and struck out less than one-quarter of the time.Several more common reasons could better help explain his rise to be the game\'s top power hitter.He hasn\'t had to worry about seeing his name in the lineup card every day. The security that comes with regular playing time can make it much easier to forget about the 0-for-4s \xe2\x80\xa6 or even the 0-for-17 stretches.There\'s also some statistical basis for his improvement. He\'s not chasing balls out of the strike zone as much as he has in the past (just 35.4% according to Fangraphs.com).""I learned how to be a little more patient at the plate,"" he says. ""I used to think when I got up to the plate I had to hit a home run before I got two strikes because there was no way I was going to put the ball in play.""I think I\'ve grown as a hitter,"" he says. ""I think I\'ve obviously matured. I\'ve learned a little more about myself and the strike zone and I\'ve really learned to be patient.""As a result, his walk rate (6.8%) is better than it\'s ever been and his 28% strikeout rate \xe2\x80\x93 while still high for even a power hitter \xe2\x80\x93 is the lowest it\'s been since his rookie year.Add in a significant increase in hard-hit balls \xe2\x80\x93 and all the elements have come together for a historic power season.So far.On the national stage, Davis will have an opportunity tonight to show exactly how far his power-hitting skills have developed. And possibly provide a glimpse of historic heights to come.Follow Steve Gardner on Twitter: @SteveAGardnerContributing: Bob NightengaleCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Cespedes tops Harper to win Home Run Derby', 'Yoenis Cespedes of the Oakland Athletics at bat during the Home Run Derby at Citi Field.(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Sports)Story HighlightsCespedes needed only five outs to take care of Harper in the final roundThe clincher was a 455-foot blast to dead centerCespedes dedicated the home runs he hit to his family in Cuba, including his 4-year-old son.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORENEW YORK \xe2\x80\x93 No matter how the 2013 All-Star Home Run Derby turned out, the night belonged to Cuban sensation Yoenis Cespedes.The Oakland Athletics outfielder set a torrid early pace, blasting 17 homers in the opening round, including several into the third deck in left field, on his way to defeating Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals 9-8 in the final.""I don\'t know if they can see this in Cuba, but the day before yesterday I spoke with my 4-year-old son who\'s in Cuba and he asked me to dedicate the home runs to him,"" Cespedes said in Spanish. ""So I dedicate them to him and to the rest of my family.\'\'HARPER: Family steals the show at DerbyCespedes needed only five outs to finish off Harper, with several of his gargantuan blasts hitting off press box windows, pickup truck windows and upper deck facades.The clincher was a 455-foot blast to dead center that the 27-year-old Cuban didn\'t even wait to see come down before celebrating.The second batter to take the field, Cespedes energized the Citi Field crowd with homers to left- and center field, the longest of which traveled 456 feet to dead center.""During the first round when I took my first five swings, I felt I was really in a rhythm and felt that I could put on a show like I did tonight,"" Cespedes said.""This stadium may be very difficult but it\'s not as difficult as Oakland and if I can do it in Oakland I thought, why couldn\'t I do it here?""Only two players in Home Run Derby history \xe2\x80\x93 Bobby Abreu with 24 in 2005 and Josh Hamilton with 28 in 2008 \xe2\x80\x93 have ever hit more homers in a single round.The final certainly wasn\'t lacking in buzz, from Cespedes\' mammoth home runs to Harper\'s sparkling gold cleats and freshly gelled Mohawk.With his father Ron on the mound and his brother Bryan (a pitcher in the Nats\' minor league system) sporting a Rollie Fingers-esque moustache in the stands, Harper hit eight home runs in each of the three rounds.DERBY: Cespedes puts on impressive display Cespedes didn\'t even need his second round with Harper\'s total of 16 the second-highest over the two rounds.""He\'s a stud, an absolute stud,"" Ron Harper said of his son\'s opponent in the final. ""He\'s got a great swing. I love his swing. He\'s great for the game.""Harper didn\'t do too badly himself. He hit a 471-foot home run in the first round that was second only to Prince Fielder\'s 483-foot shot for the longest of the night. He was consistent throughout in the hot, humid conditions, hitting eight homers in each of his three trips to the plate.""During those last two rounds I was a little tired,"" Harper admitted. ""But it was a lot of fun. I had a blast.\'\'Harper edged Colorado Rockies outfielder Michael Cuddyer by one and major league home run leader Chris Davis of the Baltimore Orioles by four to advance to the final.Four players were eliminated in the first round of the competition: Pittsburgh Pirates third baseman Pedro Alvarez (six) and two-time champion Prince Fielder of the Detroit Tigers (5) as well as both team captains, David Wright of the New York Mets (5) and Robinson Cano of the New York Yankees (4).Despite his success in his first appearance in the Derby -- at the tender age of 20 -- Harper still wasn\'t satisfied. ""I want to win,"" he said. ""That\'s the reason you\'re out there. But I had a lot of fun.\'\'On a night in which Harper and Cespedes were the headliners, leave it to the elder Harper to put things in perspective.""This probably is the first time it really hit me. It\'s like, \'Wow, this is what it\'s all about.\' It\'s really cool, the camaraderie with these guys, even though they\'re in different leagues, different teams, they\'re still rooting each other on no matter what.\'\'Contributing: Jorge L.

07/16/2013,"[('Orioles: High Flying Birds', 'At this time of the season with the All-Star break, several items have caused me to reflect upon the past and to resurrect memories a former era of Orioles greatness. I was in middle school and high school during the fabulous Orioles teams of the late 60s and early 70s.Knowing that a great many of our readers are not nearly as old (and cannot imagine life before the computer age), it is certainly surprising for some of them to hear what a committed fan in those days had to do to follow their favorite team, especially if they were outside the reach of the local radio broadcast. I was on the edge of the signal as an Orioles fan in northwest New Jersey. WBAL could definitely not be heard in the daytime, but after sunset I could usually dial it in well enough to follow the games.A few times each season when visiting family in Howard County, we would be sure to time it so as to attend a home game. The Orioles were not often featured on the Saturday game of the week, and in fact I can remember watching on what was called the first national appearance ever of the Birds. So the All-Star game was a yearly highlight for me. It would mean that I could get to actually see at least a couple of the favorite players whom I heard so much about on the radio.The primary method I had for following the Orioles was to get the daily newspaper, where there would be a four or five paragraph summary of the previous day\xe2\x80\x99s game. The local paper (one that I would later work for as a sportswriter) at that time did not have a Sunday edition. So every Sunday after getting home from church, while lunch was being prepared I would walk up the road a short distance to a local liquor/package goods store and spend 25 cents to buy a big city paper \xe2\x80\x93 which on Sundays would print all the statistics for every player in both leagues. This was a treasure for me, along with whatever I could get from Baseball Digest monthly editions.Jul 15, 2013; Flushing, NY, USA; American League outfielder Adam Jones (10) of the Baltimore Orioles brings first baseman Chris Davis (19) of the Baltimore Orioles a drink during the Home Run Derby in advance of the 2013 All Star Game at Citi Field. Mandatory Credit: Scott Rovak-USA TODAY SportsEvery kid in my school knew that I was a die-hard Orioles fan, and my fortunes rose and fell with the team. So, it was always comforting at that time to weekly see the names of now famous Orioles dominating the tops of the lists of statistics. Both Frank Robinson and Brooks Robinson were regulars in one category or another. Boog Powell would often be high on lists of homers and RBIs. Along the way, Paul Blair, Luis Aparacio, Don Buford and a few others would show up. \xc2\xa0And of course on the pitching side, the most dominant names included Jim Palmer, Dave McNally, Wally Bunker, and Mike Cuellar \xe2\x80\xa6 along with others. The point I am making is this: there was nothing rare and everything common about Baltimore Orioles players being among the very best in the game of baseball.And THAT has returned, even if we have not quite yet seen the Orioles make it back to an appearance in a World Series. Right now, there are Baltimore players in the first handful of guys mentioned at many positions of the sport \xe2\x80\x93 witnessed by the presence of five guys on the American League roster. How many of you reading this would have imagined that just, say, two to three years ago?A lot of good stuff has happened, and Orioles fans need to temper any frustrations with a thankful posture for all the good that has transpired. We have a reason to especially be interested in the the All-Start game. Like when I was a kid, the world is spinning properly again, the sun shines, and the orange and black birds fly high once again. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('The 2016 All-Star Game At Camden Yards? It Could Happen ...', ' BALTIMORE (WJZ) \xe2\x80\x94 Five players from the Orioles are playing in Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s All-Star Game. Now there\xe2\x80\x99s talk of an All-Star Game right here in Charm City. Jessica Kartalija explains it could happen. The Orioles have confirmed their bid for an All-Star Game at Camden Yards in 2016. It\xe2\x80\x99s been quite some time since the country\xe2\x80\x99s best ballplayers took the field for an All-Star Game in Baltimore: 20 years to be exact. Now it may be time for another. \xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask for a better backdrop for the mid-season classic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terry Hasseltine. Hasseltine is executive director of the Maryland Office of Sports Marketing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the venue that created all this change and culture in the game of baseball so for the All-Star Game to return back here would be pretty cool,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hasseltine. If Baltimore is to get the All-Star Game here in 2016, it would fall on the 25th anniversary season at Camden Yards. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful city to look at and walk around and plenty of eats and all kinds of stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sheri Locker. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be wonderful. The city would love to have them here and it would be great for the city of Baltimore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cheri Schutt. In 1993, the game threw more than $31 million into Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s economy. Three days of All-Star activities, including the home run derby, would be a grand slam for Charm City. \xe2\x80\x9cTens of thousands of people embarking on Baltimore and the state of Maryland, coming in for multiple day stays in our hotels, eating dinner, visiting our attractions. The harbor would be a buzz,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hasseltine. Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s competition comes from Oakland and Toronto, which have gone more than 20 years without an All-Star Game. A large number of hotel rooms and convention center space are two areas Major League Baseball takes into account before choosing an All-Star city.

They\'re still 4.5 GB from first; as a consolation prize, they are 2.5 games ahead of the Yankees. Results The O\'s did OK this week, going 4-3. They went 2-1 against the Rangers to split the series and took two out of three from the Blue Jays. Runs Scored 36, or an excellent 5.14 per game. That\'s the offense we know and love! The team as a whole hit .243/.304/.435 with a wOBA of .323. Runs Allowed 34, or 4.85 per game. Not the greatest, but, that\'s why we have this killer offense.    Best Hitter/Worst Hitter Davis, Schmavis ... Adam Jones picked up this week\'s Best Hitter award with a .550 wOBA, which led not only the Orioles, but also all of baseball.    The man to his left, however, didn\'t do so well. After excelling last week, Nick Markakis flailed about to the tune of a .194 wOBA. Best Pitcher/Worst Pitcher Wei-Yin Chen easily takes this award, going seven innings against the Rangers while giving up just one run.    Kevin Gausman is spending some time in AAA after facing eight batters in just 1.2 innings in his latest outing. He gave up two hits, walked two, struck out none, and gave up two runs. Crush Davis Update It\'s old news by now, but Davis hit four more home runs to climb to 37 on the season. The total ties the pre-ASB record set by Reggie Jackson in 1969. Manny\'s Doubles Update Machado went doubles-less; he still leads the majors with 39. Here\'s hoping he ropes a few in the All Star Game after they take Miguel Cabrera out in the fourth inning. Adam Jones ""The Power and the Patience"" Update Jones hit three dingers to give him 19 and (gasp!) walked an astounding four times to reach 11 on the season. His walk rate leapt from 2.3% to 3.1%. For context, his career low is 3.7% in 2010. The JJs Jim Johnson recovered from that nasty loss against the Yankees. He made three appearances, giving up three hits total, walking none (but striking out just two), and getting all three saves. He leads the majors in saves with 33, three ahead of Joe Nathan and Mariano Rivera. He also leads the majors in losses by relievers (7) and shares the lead in blown saves (6, with James Russell of the Cubs). Oh, baseball. J.J. Hardy had a good week with a .317 wOBA. The highlight was undoubtedly the three-run tater he hit against the Rangers on July 12th. Jair Jurrjens was DFA\'d. Coming Up No more games until Friday, when the O\'s resume against the Rangers (+23 run differential) in Arlington and then fly to Kansas City (-8) for a four-game set there.

How he got to the ASG: Selected by Jim Leyland as a replacement for Justin Verlander It seems to Orioles fans that Chris Tillman has been around forever. He came to Baltimore in the same trade that brought Adam Jones in 2008, so this is his sixth season in the organization. So sometimes it's easy to forget that Tillman is just 25 year old. When you keep that in mind his early career troubles are a little easier to understand. He was called up at age 21, a time when most minor leaguers are nowhere close to the majors (they can't all be Manny Machado). In fact, Tillman won't even be arbitration eligible until 2015. After a relatively successful rookie year in 2009, Tillman struggled through 2010 and 2011 at the major league level, bouncing between the Orioles and AAA Norfolk. He began 2012 in the minors and stayed there for eight starts before being promoted (for good?) on July 4th. He spent the second half of the season with the Orioles and looked fantastic, pitching to an ERA of 2.93 over 15 starts. He was a big part of the Orioles playoff run although he unfortunately didn't get to make an appearance in the Orioles 6 playoff games. Tillman is a fly ball pitcher who has always given up a lot of home runs. He probably always will, especially if he keeps playing at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. But when he has success it's because he doesn't allow many other baserunners on. Home runs hurt a lot less as solo shots.    Nobody knew that Tillman would be on this year's All Star team until just before the Orioles game on Sunday. When they announced the All Stars to the crowd, he took his place next to Adam Jones, Chris Davis, Manny Machado, and J.J. Hardy, surprising even the beat reporters. It turns out that Jim Leyland named Tillman as a replacement to Justin Verlander, who was starting Sunday. But they had to actually make sure Verlander started (and the game wasn't rained out or something) because they could announce it. Many would argue that Tillman isn't even the best pitcher on his own team, so it was a shock when he was named. Both Miguel Gonzalez and Wei-Yin Chen (although he's made just nine start this year) have better statistics. But either way, Tillman is in New York representing the O's.

This year I managed to take in 3 out of the 4 games of this series and 7 out of the 10 total games played in the season series. This write up will focus on the prospects of note that I had the pleasure (and occasional frustration) of watching over the past 3 games. A brief note on the opposition. The Blue Rocks are an affiliate of the Kansas City Royals. They feature a number of talented arms, both in the rotation as well as the bullpen. In addition, Frawley Stadium has throughout it's history played as a pitching friendly park. I note this in order to give the reader some context as to the challenges the hitters faced. First and foremost among the hitting prospects is catcher Michael Ohlman, and he didn't disappoint. 6-18 on the series with 1 HBP, 1 HR, and 5 Ks at the plate. He's got above average power, no doubt. And he has the bat speed to handle velocity, as well as a strong natural hit tool. He showed some decent speed for a big guy, scoring from 1B on a double at one point. He did struggle with breaking pitches though, as I have 3 of his 5 Ks resulting on sliders or curves. That's going to be a problem he'll have to address as he progresses up the farm or he is apt to stall out in AA. Ohlman's defense on the other hand...it's a work in progress at the moment. He committed 1 error, allowed 2 passed balls, and only managed to throw out 1 of 6 stolen base attempts. I recorded one pop time (time it takes the ball to be thrown to 2B on a steal) of 2.02 seconds. That's average at best. You really want to see sub 2 seconds, and preferably sub 1.9 seconds. Just for reference, Matt Wieters works in the 1.8s consistently. I noted that he isn't a particularly quiet receiver behind the plate. That is, he tended to be a little fidgety, with his hips swaying and his butt sagging down towards the ground. He appeared a bit uncomfortable tracking a pop out at one point. And he had a tendency to reach across his body to stab at pitches in the dirt, rather than move his feet and get his body in front of the ball to smother it. He also lost his grip on the ball during a transfer which allowed a SB.    He did, however, appear to do a good job of framing pitches, extending his arm out and holding it still to give the ump a good look at where the ball arrived. In the long run, I think it's optimistic to think Ohlman can remain even a fringe average catcher, defensively. I think his bat can play going forward. He'll need to work on identifying and reacting to breaking stuff, but he has the power and natural hitting ability to be able to handle a potential future move to 1B or even DH.    First baseman Christian Walker also had a strong series: 5-17, w/ a 2B, a HR, 1 SF, 1 BB and 1 K. He showed me the most consistently strong at bats, working counts, and making hard contact frequently. Even his strikeout was on a check swing as he collapsed backwards due to a ball flying at his head. It was announced that he will be promoted to AA Bowie. He certainly seems to have the hit tool and approach to handle the AA level. The remaining question is how much power does he have in his bat? High OBP first basemen can make it to majors, but it's a tough road and they usually have to show strong defense in conjunction. Keith Law mentioned on his podcast that he views Walker as below average defensively. I don't agree with that assessment, as I saw nothing that would cause me to demerit his defensive abilities. That's not to say I think he's a good defender. He seems average. His short, stocky build may limit his range and ability to stretch out for throws on close plays, but he catches what comes his way, and that's a first baseman's primary responsibility.    (3B) Nick Delmonico, much like Ohlman and Walker, had a strong series at the plate but has significant and legitimate concerns regarding his defense. Let's start with the good: Delmonico returned from a viral infection in Game 2 of the series. He had missed a week previously and it looked like he wasn't quite right as he K'd thrice before stinging a ball to deep CF for a flyout in his last at bat of the night. In the 3rd game he delivered an RBI single in the 1st inning and stole a base before striking out swinging twice and popping out in the infield twice. In the finale though he went 3-4 with 3 singles (2 to RF and one into LF) along with another SB, a heady tag up from 1st on a SF hit to RF where the defender overthrew the cut off man, as well as sting a ball for a fly out to deep CF that may have been the hardest hit ball on the night by any player. Though quite aggressive at the plate, he has a good hit tool and I think there is some more power to be discovered in him. He's not a burner on the base paths, but he does have average speed and good instincts and awareness there. The problem, of course is the defense, where two plays in particular stood out. The first, where he charged the ball after a sac bunt attempt, slipped as he bent down to field it barehanded, and nearly fell on his keister in the process. And the second came about on a routine grounder where he let the ball play him rather than charge it and take control of the situation. The ball came right to him, but it took a bit of a large hope (about chest high) and he played it off to his side rather than get in front of it. Since he waited for the ball to come to him he had to rush his throw to 1B and it sailed high, pulling Christian Walker off the bag. These two plays happened in the same inning and cost his pitcher an earned run as well as a number of additional pitches. He also demonstrated a slow first step and fall down range on some balls hit into the 3B-SS hole. Barring some epiphany, he did not look like he has any business as a third baseman. It was certainly worth a shot to see if he could hack it, just as it was worth a shot to see if he could hack it at 2B last season. Neither worked out. He had seen time at 1B last season (after returning from a mid season knee injury) and now has seen a game there this season as well. I'd like to see him get a shot in either RF (preferable, just to see if his arm can play out there) or LF before moving him to 1B. (OF) Tucker Nathans is a 24 year old player signed out of the Independent Leagues earlier this year. He was promoted to Frederick just prior to this series, so I got to see his first taste of advanced A ball. He got off to a decent start as he singled and drew a walk in his first two plate appearances. Overall he went 3-11 in the series w/ 1 double, 1 SB, 2 BBs, and 5 Ks (3 of them looking). He's been on a multi-hit game streak since the final game of this series though, so I think he has adjusted to the uptick in quality of the pitching. He seemed to handle himself well enough in LF, though he didn't have many opportunities. Two final players I'd like to mention, both of whom are outfielders who seem to have stalled out at the A+ level: Brenden Webb and Glynn Davis. Webb fascinated me last season as he seemed to demonstrate a tantalizing combo of fantastic plate discipline with some nice pop and speed. The problem was that he couldn't hit regularly; he was a '3 True Outcomes' type of player (meaning his PAs would typically end one of 3 ways: Hard hit (2B or HR), BB, or K). But with slightly better pitching in advanced A ball, his lack of a hit tool has proved fatal to his prospect status. He went 0-6 in the series with 3 Ks and 1 BB. He still has an eye for the strike zone. He just can't make contact enough as the stuff pitchers are throwing him has gotten better. He is still just 23, and perhaps he can adjust his approach. But he's not a prospect of any regard going forward. The same can be said of (OF) Glynn Davis. A nice scouting find out of Catonsville C.C., Davis showed blazing speed and the ability to handle CF on defense. Unfortunately, much like Webb, he can't make consistent enough contact. Unlike Webb, Davis doesn't have much of any power to cover up a lacking hit tool, and his strike zone judgement appeared, to my eyes, to be pretty bad. He would jump back from pitches (non-breaking balls) that found the inside corner. He did manage to go 3-8, with no SB attempts and 2 Ks in the series. Unless he can improve the plate approach and add some pop when he does make contact, I just don't see it for him going forward. So that covers the hitters of note that I saw. In Part 2 I will cover the pitchers I saw.

He is one of two players in baseball history to have at least 30 home runs and 90 RBIs before the All-Star break, according to ESPN Stats and Info. The other is Detroit Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera, also this season. As for the home runs, only Barry Bonds has had more before the All-Star break than Davis. Bonds had 39 home runs in 2001 on his way to hitting a record 73, and his San Francisco Giants had fewer games than the Orioles, who have played 96 games so far. Catching Bonds will be highly unlikely, but barring injury, Davis should shatter the club record of 50 homers. var adSkipCounter = 0; 11 -- victories for Chris Tillman, three more than Hiroki Kuroda.By most measures, Kuroda, who pitches for the rival New York Yankees, has had a better season statistically than Tillman, who leads the Orioles in wins. Kuroda is second among American League starters and fifth in the majors with a 2.65 ERA. His 1.05 WHIP is 13th in baseball and he is 28th in strikeout-to-walk ratio, per the Sporting News. Meanwhile, Tillman is 55th in the majors with a 3.95 ERA. He is 65th in WHIP and 71st in strikeout-to-walk ratio. So why did American League manager Jim Leyland choose Tillman over Kuroda? Tillman is 11-3. That\'s the only stat he needed to see.232 -- bases on balls drawn by the Orioles so far this season.In his past positions, Orioles executive vice president Dan Duquette prioritized players who drew a lot of walks and had high on-base percentages. But in the second year of his tenure in Baltimore, the Orioles are near the bottom of baseball in walks. They have drawn just 232 this season, the second lowest in the American League and fourth lowest in the major leagues. Manny Machado has earned a free pass just 16 times and Adam Jones just 13. But the Orioles do lead the majors in homers, though, so Duquette can deal with a lack of walks..280 -- the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 average with runners in scoring position.Last season, the Orioles struggled to bring runners home when they were in scoring position. They batted .256 in those situations, which ranked 16th in baseball. This season, they are batting .280 with runners in scoring position, which ranks fourth. That is one of the biggest reasons why the Orioles are averaging 4.81 runs in 2013 after averaging 4.40 in 2012. Three Orioles starters are batting over .325 with runners in scoring position, led by Davis, who is batting a ridiculous .382 in those situations with 11 homers and 60 RBIs.1.96 -- Matt Hobgood\xe2\x80\x99s ERA in his final six outings in Delmarva.Hobgood, the team\'s first-round draft in 2009, was promoted this week to High-A Frederick after a successful first half of the season at Low-A Delmarva. The 22-year-old, who missed all of the 2012 season after surgery on his right rotator cuff, had been operating out of the bullpen for the Shorebirds, pitching 63 innings in 24 appearances. He had posted a 7-3 record with a 3.71 ERA. In his final six appearances there, Hobgood allowed four earned runs over 18 1/3 innings for a 1.96 ERA. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see if he can continue to climb the ladder at the next rung.Bloggers note: Have a nifty stat you want to share? E-mail me at matt.vensel@baltsun.com or tweet at me at @mattvensel.

Hardy.Hardy\'s RBI gave the American League a 2-0 lead before the inning ended on a double play. As Hardy jogged off the field, the Fox national television cameras went to commercial break and the 45,186 fans at Citi Field occupied themselves with mid-inning entertainment.That\'s when Jones and Orioles first baseman Chris Davis rushed out of the dugout to meet Hardy in foul territory \xe2\x80\x94 and to give Hardy a collective fist bump. Davis had Hardy\'s glove and cap, while Jones had to run back to the dugout to get his own gear after the impromptu and subtle, all-Baltimore celebration.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s been awesome, not only being here and being amongst all these great players, but being able to share those type of things with your teammates that you are with day in and day out, that was huge,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had to give [Hardy] a little bit of a hard time in the fact that he beat out a double play. J.J.\'s not the most swift of foot. ...""It was one of those weird moments in baseball, and its something you really can appreciate as a fan and a player.""Ultimately, the Orioles\' starting trio held its own in the game. Davis was 1-for-3, and his line single off first baseman Joey Votto\'s glove in the fourth inning set up the American League\'s first run. Detroit\'s Miguel Cabrera doubled to start the fourth against Arizona\'s Patrick Corbin, moved to third on Davis\' single and scored on a sacrifice fly by Toronto\'s Jose Bautista to break a scoreless tie.Davis played five full innings. Hardy (who was 0-for-2 with an RBI) played six innings and Jones (1-for-3 with a run scored) had one final at-bat in the seventh.Jones was 5-for-17 against Lee in his career before the double \xe2\x80\x94 which was his first hit in four All-Star at-bats over three games.Jones also had an impressive 10-pitch at-bat in the second before striking out against the New York Mets\' Matt Harvey. He fanned again in the top of the seventh on a 101-mph fastball from Cincinnati\'s Aroldis Chapman.Third baseman Manny Machado, who made his first All-Star game as a reserve, came in as a defensive replacement in the top of the sixth and played alongside Hardy for an inning. In the seventh, Machado made a nice defensive play, snagging a two-hopper at the line and throwing a strike to first to get Paul Goldschmidt.\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a great experience to go out there and get a ground ball,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cFortinately, my first one got to be that nice play. But overall, it was a great experience and something I\'ll take for the rest of my life.\xe2\x80\x9dMachado had one at-bat, a strikeout against Atlanta\'s Craig Kimbrel that stranded Jason Kipnis \xe2\x80\x94 who had just smacked a RBI double \xe2\x80\x94 at third base.The Orioles\' fifth All Star, right-hander Chris Tillman, didn\'t pitch. He wasn\'t needed. The National League managed just three hits all night.Perhaps the two most memorable moments on Tuesday \xe2\x80\x94 nationally, anyway \xe2\x80\x94 were courtesy of the New York Yankees. The first one was cringe-worthy and the second one scrapbook-worthy.Three pitches into the night, Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano took a 96-mph fastball off his right quadriceps, just above his knee. He hobbled to first, stayed in for a batter and then was lifted for pinch-runner Dustin Pedroia.X-rays were negative and he was diagnosed with a bruise. Cano said he hopes to play in Friday\'s second-half opener. But he was disappointed that he couldn\'t really participate on Tuesday.\xe2\x80\x9cYou\'ve been waiting for this moment for a long time. I mean, that\'s like any kid\'s dream come true: You\'re in front of the home crowd, [second] pitch,\xe2\x80\x9d Cano said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s disappointing, but at the same time, that\'s part of the game, so what else can you say?\xe2\x80\x9d1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

Prob added to roster after\r \xe2\x80\x94 Roch Kubatko (@masnRoch) July 18, 2013    The ""who else"" is in reference to Roch earlier reporting that Danny Valencia was not with Norfolk, perhaps on his way to join the major league club as well. Roch\'s speculation was that Nolan Reimold could be headed to the disabled list to make room for Valencia. If Urrutia is being added to the roster as well, that would necessitate moves on both the 25-man and 40-man rosters. This is always a fun game to play with Dan Duquette roster moves. It\'s possible that Valencia could be designated for assignment to make room for Urrutia on the 40-man roster and Reimold could be placed on the DL with a ""hamstring injury"" and that would connect all of this afternoon\'s dots.    Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports tweets a more definite statement: the Orioles are promoting Urrutia.    UPDATE (4:00pm): The Baltimore beat crew has confirmed that the Orioles will be adding both Urrutia and Valencia, meaning that there will have to be two spaces cleared on the 25-man roster and one 40-man roster spot opened. If we take Reimold to the DL as a given, that leaves one 25-man and one 40-man spot to be cleared. The most-likely option bait would seem to be Ryan Flaherty. 40-man dead weight could be Steve Johnson being transferred to the 60-day disabled list, or a pitcher like Josh Stinson could be designated for assignment.    Urrutia is in his first professional season in the United States. He began the year with 52 games at Double-A Bowie, during which he batted .365/.433/.550, and after a promotion to Triple-A Norfolk, he continued the hot hitting, with a .367/.406/.467 slash line in 15 games. Talent evaluators like ESPN\'s Keith Law indicate that scouts think Urrutia probably profiles as just a designated hitter, but as you may have noticed, Orioles designated hitters are second-worst in the American League. Even a modest performance like a .700 OPS would be an improvement. Anything above that would be gravy.  More from Camden Chat:   Poll: How many wins will the Orioles have in the regular season?

Photo: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsFor those of you who would debate whether the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first half MVP should be Manny Machado or Chris Davis, we won\xe2\x80\x99t argue your choice. It\xe2\x80\x99s a virtual tie, and the question of which one the team can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose is also a tie. One of the keys to the second half is that neither should have a serious drop-off.But let\xe2\x80\x99s also address the honor of Oriole from whom the most improvement is necessary. Jason Hammel is in that conversation, along with Matt Wieters from an offensive standpoint. The position that has fallen the most noticeably short of expectations is Designated Hitter, which was divided between Ryan Flaherty, Alexi Casilla, Chris Dickerson, and just recently, Nolan Reimold and Brian Roberts, just since their return from the DL.I have this little theory on the failure of the DHs. When you alternate different people in that slot, no one of them ever gets into a rhythm or a routine. In performing the\xc2\xa0DH role, even if you\xe2\x80\x99re the full-time guy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get to play the field and forget your last at-bat. You just get to sit there and dwell on it, or if you got a hit, what you did says fresh in your mind to the point of repeating it. If you\xe2\x80\x99re not the regular DH, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even get to do that, even if it was good. You just have to go up there almost cold and try to make something happen.All the best DHs in history, Harold Baines and Edgar Martinez, and whoever else you want to name who was consistently good, were their team\xe2\x80\x99s main DH. Buck\xe2\x80\x99s love affair with DHs who can also play the field works sometimes, but the constant alternation, while there have been highlights, often works to a disadvantage.You may say it is a circular argument, because if a DH candidate could hit, he would play more regularly. But if it\xe2\x80\x99s circular to say the great ones played more because they could hit, it\xe2\x80\x99s also true they were made DHs because they were fine hitters in their careers, before age and injuries caught up and diminished them defensively (as is the case with David Ortiz right now). In other words, something \xe2\x80\x93 the fact that hitting has been their track record \xe2\x80\x93 must have qualified them for the job description stating: Your one and only responsibility is to hit. When you look at the O\xe2\x80\x99s conglomeration of DHs, is great hitting in any of their backgrounds other than Brian Roberts?Is Henry Urrutia the answer to any or all of this? To quote the classic cop-out of all the experts, only time will tell. It was reported today that Urrutia and Danny Valencia are being recalled and would join the team in Arlington, Texas, this weekend. Urrutia will be placed on what is called the 24-hour taxi squad, and his contract, according to reports, may be purchased from Norfolk after he is evaluated.It did not take an expert, though, to see the roles played by Oriole representatives in the All Star Game. Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 double and run scored, J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice RBI, Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 hit moving Prince Fielder to third, and Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s sparkling, defensive play.The torn callus on Davis\xe2\x80\x99 right hand didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to hinder him, and it would behoove that wound to heal by Friday, when the Orioles begin the second half against the Texas Rangers. To catch Roger Maris\xe2\x80\x98 mark of 61 home runs in the 66 remaining games, Davis, sitting at 37, would have to hit one approximately every 2-3 games. It is a given that he will hit a lull somewhere along the line.Gentlemen, restart your engines. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles analysis: How does the starting rotation stack up ...', ' Seemingly every evaluation of a pitcher includes an assessment of whether he\'s an ""ace"", or maybe he\'s more of a ""true #2"" or a ""back-end 4/5 guy"". Each such evaluation is fodder for fans of teams to talk about who is being disrespected among their guys and who is being overrated among the other guys, especially a particular rival team\'s guys. All of this is a bunch of hypothetical theorizing. No team gets to construct its rotation by considering what ephemeral qualities make a #1 starter as opposed to a #4 starter. Through the draft, free agent signings, trades, and waiver wire pickups, pitchers are acquired and developed. It\'s the executive\'s job to juggle to make sure the best five pitchers are starting games at a given time. Injuries and ineffectiveness make it a constant struggle. Orioles fans know this better than most, having seen 13 different pitchers start games this season. How those starters are ranked doesn\'t matter. Are those five guys collectively pitching better than most of the rotations of other teams? They don\'t even have to match up exactly, because best pitcher vs. best pitcher matchups aren\'t guaranteed. The Opening Day (#1) starter could end up sucking, as has been the case for the O\'s the past two seasons. In the end, the best pitcher on a team is the one who pitches the best. The #2 pitches second-best, and so on. Considering this, how do the Orioles compare on a slot-by-slot basis against the rest of the tough American League East?    For the purposes of this comparison, I\'m counting the five pitchers who have thrown the most innings as starters for each team. Due to the ever-shifting nature of baseball rosters, they may not be the five pitchers starting for the rest of the season, but this is the story of the season so far.    The #1-#5 designations have been made on the basis of ERA. This is purely about results. Some pitchers may have been lucky and some may have been unlucky. They may regress. Some may pitch in hitters\' parks. Who is ranked where could change by season\'s end. This is a snapshot of this moment in time. THE BEST OF THE EAST (#1)   Player Team IP ERA K/9 BB/9 HR/9   Wei-Yin Chen Orioles 54.1 2.82 5.13 2.48 0.50   Clay Buchholz Red Sox 84.1 1.71 8.64 3.09 0.21   Hiroki Kuroda Yankees 118.2 2.65 6.37 1.82 0.91   Alex Cobb Rays 83.2 3.01 8.18 2.47 0.97   Esmil Rogers Blue Jays 44 3.27 7.16 2.86 0.82      I find some immediate regret for my methodology, because the pattern here, except for Kuroda, is that each team\'s ""best"" starter seems to be one who hasn\'t thrown as many innings to experience regression. Buchholz, in particular, stands out. No starter is 1.71 ERA over a full season good. That just doesn\'t happen. He is on the disabled list. So is Cobb. Chen spent time there. Chen compares favorably enough, but his strikeout rate is the lowest, and if that doesn\'t increase, he\'s probably due for an increase in his ERA. The Yankees get the edge here. THE FIRST LOSERS (#2)   Player Team IP ERA K/9 BB/9 HR/9   Miguel Gonzalez Orioles 101 3.48 6.77 3.03 1.25   John Lackey Red Sox 100.1 2.78 8.34 2.06 1.26   CC Sabathia Yankees 137 4.07 7.69 1.97 1.38   Matt Moore Rays 107.1 3.44 9.06 4.61 0.67   R.A. Dickey Blue Jays 128.2 4.69 6.44 3.29 1.40   In an interesting coincidence, if you rank these second-best starters by their ERA, they line up the same as do their teams in the standings. Would you take Lackey over any of the rest of these guys for the rest of the season? He is having a heck of a year, but his FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching) is 3.83, meaning he could be due to regress. Gonzalez has that warning flag as well. Even the ""struggling"" #2 starters are at least doing the job of eating innings for their teams. I wonder what it would be like if the Orioles had a starter like Moore who could strike out over a batter per inning, maybe without quite as many walks. The Red Sox come out on top here. THE CHARMERS (#3)   Player Team IP ERA K/9 BB/9 HR/9   Chris Tillman Orioles 111.2 3.95 7.17 3.30 1.61   Felix Doubront Red Sox 93.2 3.56 8.55 3.94 0.77   Andy Pettitte Yankees 98.1 4.39 6.50 2.47 0.82   David Price Rays 80 3.94 7.54 1.58 1.01   Mark Buehrle Blue Jays 116 4.89 5.97 2.33 1.24   That\'s Chris Tillman, All-Star and 11-game winner, to you. In terms of his ERA, he looks fine enough in this company, but he gives up home runs like they\'re going out of style, so it is hard to count on him to be some kind of staff ace. On the other hand, as a middle-of-the-rotation guy... well, he doesn\'t look so bad next to these others. Never mind that 4.95 FIP. The Red Sox come out on top once again, and that\'s why they\'re leading the division. NOTHING CLEVER TO SAY ABOUT (#4)   Player Team IP ERA K/9 BB/9 HR/9   Jason Hammel Orioles 111.2 5.24 6.29 2.98 1.53   Ryan Dempster Red Sox 110.1 4.24 8.48 4.08 1.63   Phil Hughes Yankees 102.1 4.57 7.74 2.29 1.58   Jeremy Hellickson Rays 117.2 4.67 7.42 1.99 1.15   Josh Johnson Blue Jays 66.1 5.16 9.09 3.12 1.36   Here is where the Orioles start to really fall behind the rest of the division, especially the other three contending teams. Hammel was such a strength for the team last year, and now he is the fourth-best starter, allowing significantly more runs than even other fourth-best starters. He does not look to be in for a dose of regression in his favor, with a 5.08 FIP not representing much improvement. The good news is that none of these fourth-best guys are better than Tillman, the Orioles\' third-best guy. Of course, one bad start can change that in a hurry, even at this point in the season. PLEASE DRINK (THE FIFTHS) RESPONSIBLY   Player Team IP ERA K/9 BB/9 HR/9   Freddy Garcia Orioles 52 5.88 4.15 2.08 2.77   Jon Lester Red Sox 125.2 4.58 7.38 3.22 1.07   David Phelps Yankees 65.2 4.93 7.26 3.29 0.82   Roberto Hernandez Rays 108.1 4.90 6.98 2.08 1.50   Brandon Morrow Blue Jays 54.1 5.63 6.96 2.98 1.99   Garcia is not starting games for the Orioles any more, but every pitcher that started games that wasn\'t listed (other than Zach Britton) has an ERA about as bad or worse. It\'ll probably be Scott Feldman bringing up the rear, and he should probably be better than this. One thing that stands out is that the Yankees, Rays, and Red Sox have all had five starters that started at least twelve games. Only seven pitchers have made starts for the Yankees, with the two extras - Ivan Nova and Vidal Nuno - both having a lower ERA than Phelps. For the Rays, Chris Archer has made nine starts and has a 2.96 ERA. Another trend that is apparent is that the O\'s starters lag behind in strikeout rate significantly. Every Red Sox starter has a higher K/9 than the O\'s starter with the best (Tillman). Is there hope for improvement here? Well... not really. Gonzalez is good, but he\'s probably not any better than his current results. Tillman is already ""lucky"" and is probably not much better than his current results. Chen\'s not bad, but is probably worse than his current results, though he\'s the one pitcher who might increase the strikeout rate. Hammel is not having a good year. If they decide they\'ve had enough of Hammel, perhaps Britton will get some more chances. A 4.76 ERA isn\'t good, but it is still noticeably better than Hammel\'s performance. An improving Kevin Gausman could take that spot. However, for the most part, the rotation is what it is, and it\'s not a good rotation compared to the other contenders. If the offense flags, they may shoulder the blame if the Orioles fall out of the race, but this is the real problem area for the team, and despite Dan Duquette\'s attempts to stack depth again this year, there\'s not much help in sight.

Brooks, Frank and Boog were stars in that championship season. But who remembers Russ Snyder?""I had a pretty good year, too,"" said Snyder, 79.Did he ever.A slap-hitting, sharp-fielding outfielder, Snyder batted .306 for the World Series champion Orioles that year. He led the American League in hitting (.347) at the All-Star break.His glove served the team down the stretch. On Sept. 22, in a victory over Kansas City, Snyder\'s diving catch of a line drive finished off the Athletics and clinched the Orioles\' first pennant. And in the World Series opener in Los Angeles \xe2\x80\x94 a 5-2 victory \xe2\x80\x94 he scored the game\'s first run, singled in another and saved two Dodgers\' runs in the second inning with a dramatic lunging catch of John Roseboro\'s sinking liner.Forty-seven years later, Snyder recalled his desperation in running down that shot in center field. var adSkipCounter = 0; ""When the ball was hit, I just took off,"" he said from his home in Nelson, Neb. ""The closer I got, the more I thought I could catch it. I dove and \xe2\x80\xa6 well, that really was one of the turning points of the Series.""Snyder started two games in the Orioles\' sweep of the Dodgers. After Game 4, amid the beer-soaked hoopla in the clubhouse, he scrawled a back-to-earth message on the blackboard: Everybody due in uniform March 1.""What great times those were,"" said Snyder, who played for the Orioles from 1961 through 1967. ""We were one happy family. Boog [Powell] was a big teddy bear; I never once saw him mad. Frank [Robinson] had a great attitude. And Brooks [Robinson] \xe2\x80\x94 well, I never saw a guy who was as neat off the field as he was on it.""Our kids all played together. Our wives were friends. We spent our off days together. Nobody was left out, during games or after. That\'s why we won as much as we did.""Quiet and self-effacing, Snyder hit .280 in seven years with the Orioles and accepted his role as a platoon player, though he managed to see plenty of action. In 1962, he led the club in batting (.305), beat out 12 bunts for base hits and, in one game, scored from second base on a sacrifice fly.Of Snyder, manager Hank Bauer once said: ""Nobody notices him until he beats their brains out.""That was OK with the modest Nebraskan.""I was pencilled in as a reserve, but it didn\'t bother me,"" he said. ""I didn\'t need press clippings. I\'m just proud that when I got the opportunity to play, I showed them that I could do the job.""He retired in 1970, returned home, bought a bar and built a steakhouse beside it. He painted an infield on the dance floor, baselines included, and filled the place with his baseball treasures. Twelve years later, the building was struck by lightning and burned to the ground.""I still have a few keepsakes, like the picture of my World Series catch against Roseboro,"" Snyder said. ""And one of me and [catcher] Charlie Lau, pouring champagne on each other after we won the pennant.""Having won the Series, the Orioles captured the city\'s heart.""Every Sunday, Charlie and I would take a couple of autographed baseballs to one restaurant and they\'d give us a couple of dozen crabs,"" he said. ""What could be better?""An avid outdoorsman, Snyder also worked for the government as a soil conservation technician, constructing terraces and dams for erosion-plagued farms.Married 47 years to his high school sweetheart, Snyder lost his wife, Ann, to cancer in 2002. He lives alone but not far from his three children, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.""I had a slight stroke last year, but they put in a pacemaker and I\'m getting along real good,"" he said.He spends much of his time tending his vegetable garden, growing tomatoes, cucumbers and asparagus for family and neighbors.""It\'s been a good life,"" Snyder said.

I had a great trip to Italy with my family, and I sincerely appreciate readers putting up with some of the quirks that came with the articles published during that period of time as a result of my absence here at home. Obviously I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to include as many of the details in games as I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t physically watching them. However I will say that going abroad always makes me appreciate more the luxuries that we have here in America, not the least among them is the great sport of baseball!The Baltimore Orioles now find themselves in a strange position as they get set to open up the second half of the season with only 66 games remaining. This of course is due to the fact that the all-star break was a week later than normal this year, being in the third week as opposed to the second week of July. Nevertheless, you still play 162 in some way, shape or form! The main concern for the O\xe2\x80\x99s remains the starting rotation, although that has been bolstered a bit with the return of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s starter Wei-Yin Chen (who re-joined the team just before the break), and the addition of Scott Feldman. Many fans are still hoping and even counting on Dan Duquette to add a top-of-the-rotation arm to the mix via trade; Cliff Lee\xe2\x80\x98s name always seems to continue coming up. Whether or not that happens remains to be seen as we get closer to the deadline at the end of the month. My personal opinion is that if the O\xe2\x80\x99s can continue getting by with what they have until then, Duquette might be inclined to make a trade through waivers prior to next month\xe2\x80\x99s waiver deadline.However that aside, the Orioles are once again building towards October in the second half of the season. Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s winning streak at the end of the first half projected them into second place in the division at the break. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are currently 4.5 games out of first, and two games behind Tampa for second. They\xe2\x80\x99re also a game behind Texas in the second wild card spot, which makes this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s series an important one. However most importantly, they\xe2\x80\x99re within striking distance of first place in the AL East. Texas has not been an easy place for the Orioles to play the last few seasons, although their most recent excursion to Rangers Ballpark was pretty successful: last October they won the first-ever AL Wild Card game there. On the flip side, players such as Chris Davis and Adam Jones (who finished the first half on hot streaks) have an opportunity to allow the Orioles to have a field day at the plate all weekend. Thus the key for the Birds is for their pitchers to keep the ball in the park.Chen will be opposed by Derek Holland of Texas tonight to get that second half going. The Orioles will make two roster moves prior to this evening\xe2\x80\x99s game, recalling Danny Valencia to the big league club, and selecting the contract of outfielder Henry Urrutia from triple-A Norfolk. Urrutia of course is a Cuban defector and was signed by the O\xe2\x80\x99s this season; he also comes to the team after slaying minor league pitching. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear what the corresponding moves will be, however the O\xe2\x80\x99s will have to send two guys out in order to make room for Valencia and Urrutia.

07/20/2013,"[('Highlighting Some Unique Orioles Statistics - Birds Watcher', 'This has been an interesting season for the Baltimore Orioles in regard to the varieties of unique statistics heard just about every day about this squad and its interesting array of players. One of the most attractive features for me about the great sport of baseball is the way the game yields itself to countless statistical analyses. The computer age has given us an explosion of this information. And now we are able to track just about everything, right down to the players\xe2\x80\x99 averages on days they call their grandmother before the game versus days they spoke to their agent.So today, I thought I would pull out a few statistics that have caught my ear or eye in recent days \xe2\x80\x93 these being garnered from various Orioles media outlets and Baseball-Reference.com.The Tale of Two DefensesThe Orioles lead all of baseball with a .992 fielding percentage, which would be a club record if sustained through the end of the year. The value of a great defense was seen last evening in Texas, and I would submit that it was the difference in the game. While the Orioles had Nick Markakis pulling back a home-run ball over the fence and a Rangers runner being picked off third on an 8-6-5 throw, Texas failed to make a couple of not terribly difficult plays (at first base and left-center field) that would lead to the decisive Orioles runs. Texas is 8th in the AL in fielding, and 13th overall.Mind Boggling Davis / Machado NumbersYou know the guys on your favorite team are having a good year when you hear comparisons of their stats in the same breath as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s 39 doubles, and Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 37 homers lead the majors \xe2\x80\xa6 and the last time teammates did this was in 1927 when Gehrig had 52 doubles and Ruth 60 homers.I am not making this up when I tell you that at the very same time I was writing the paragraph above, my phone buzzed with a text message from the Baltimore Sun \xe2\x80\x93 advertising an app to track Machado and Davis. It is called \xe2\x80\x9cChase Street: Chris Davis and Manny Machado Stat Tracker.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Very cool!Davis is the only player in major league history to have 25-plus doubles, 30-plus home runs and 85-plus RBIs prior to the All-Star Game. This is not normal baseball behavior.Jul 19, 2013; Arlington, TX, USA; Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter (26) watches the game against the Texas Rangers during the third inning at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. Mandatory Credit: Jim Cowsert-USA TODAY SportsShowalter\xe2\x80\x99s 1132 Wins (4x 250+)With the win in Texas last night, Buck Showalter became the fourth manager in the history of baseball to have at least 250 wins with four different teams. The others who have done this are Joe Torre, Gene Mauch, and Dick Williams. Buck now has 250 wins with Texas and Arizona, along with 313 for the Yankees and 319 with Texas. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the not-so-bold prediction that Showalter goes down in baseball history ultimately for what was done in Baltimore!But what does it say about a person who has wins spread out like this? It says that a guy knows how to win. Buck himself, when questioned about it in the post-game interview, humbly acknowledged that there were nearly as many losses. This is true in a macro way, as his career record at this moment is 1132-1061 for a win percentage of .516.\xc2\xa0 But remember this: in each of the four cities, the first full year was a major rebuilding challenge (a combined record of 281-367 / .437 winning percentage).That Buck has moved on three times might also indicate that he was a prickly personality that wore out his welcome (see Gene Mauch!). I\xe2\x80\x99ve read these kinds of things and cannot imagine it from what I see of the guy. Maybe he has grown personally and learned interpersonal skills not previously possessed \xe2\x80\xa6 or maybe it says he is a bit A.D.D. (I can relate to that one, and being a year older than Buck, and even called \xe2\x80\x9cBuckie\xe2\x80\x9d growing up \xe2\x80\x93 we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have Ritalin and Adderral to calm us down!)Home Run WitnessesSpeaking of what Buck Showalter has had to endure, he is the manager in baseball who has been the witness this season of the most home runs hit \xe2\x80\x93 both by his own team and the opposition.\xc2\xa0 The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 133 HRs are the most in MLB \xe2\x80\x93 leading the Mariners and Blue Jays by 14.\xc2\xa0 BUT, the Orioles have allowed 123, which is one more than Houston. In fact, 42% of all runs scored against the Orioles this year have been by the long ball. Some of this is simply the realities of playing half of all games at Oriole Park, but we know that much of it relates also to pitching woes.The Pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s Best FriendA lesser statistic that balances out those painful homers allowed numbers a little bit (maybe?) is that the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 pitchers have also induced the 3rd most GIDP in MLB with 90. This again likely also highlights the great Orioles infield defense. Interestingly, the team with the most GIDP is St. Louis (95) \xe2\x80\x93 not surprising, given their great pitching. But in second place is Houston with 92. Hmm! So, I guess this is one of those statistics that may not mean as much as one would think at first glance. Teams that allow more baserunners probably have more situational opportunities for double play grounders. It all depends upon when they happen.Undeniable Necessary StatsIt does not take a very insightful baseball analyst to know and understand what the Orioles must do to have success in the final 65 games. Pitching will be the key (as it always is, but especially with this team at this juncture).\xc2\xa0 I am encouraged that this will happen. It is interesting to know that the Orioles staff ERA at the All-Star break last year was 4.77, while this year it is a near identical 4.79.\xc2\xa0 This year, the Orioles were 10 games over 500, while they were but 45-40 in 2012.For the Orioles to return to the playoffs, they are going to need to return to the great pitching that carried them through August and September of the season past. This is doable \xe2\x80\x93 especially since the offense and defensive support is even better. It is not a \xe2\x80\x9cdone deal\xe2\x80\x9d but it is attainable. And there is no way it can be anything but a close dog fight the whole time. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
07/21/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles 7, Texas Rangers 4: Hit barrage by the ...', "" The Baltimore Orioles defeated the Texas Rangers tonight behind another strong effort by Miguel Gonzalez and an attack by the offense that featured at least one hit by every batter in the lineup. The win puts the Orioles back in position for a wild card spots and allows them to gain a game on the first place Red Sox, who lost today. Miguel Gonzalez had yet another good start tonight, allowing just one run in six and two-thirds innings pitched. He was far from perfect, but even on a night when his pitch count went high he still made it into the seventh inning. He lowered his ERA during the game from 3.48 to 3.34, and he has now allowed three or less earned runs in fourteen of his seventeen starts. In short, I love him. Gonzalez had just one three-up, three-down inning on the night, but he never let a runner past second base until the eighth inning and he had some help from his defense. In the second inning, with A.J. Pierzynski on first base with one out, Elvis Andrus hit a soft liner to center field. Adam Jones put up his glove like he was going to catch it, and Pierzynski went back to first base. But Jones wasn't even close to it and it fell in front of him. Because his deke worked he was able to throw Pierzynski out at second base. It was a great play and Jones couldn't help but grin in the outfield when it worked. Gonzalez never pitched without a lead in the game as the O's offense scored two runs in the first inning, one in the second, and four in the third before their bats went quiet for the night. Ross Wolf was on the mound for the Rangers and he did not look good. In the first inning Nate McLouth singled and Nick Markakis walked, setting up back-to-back RBI singles by Jones and Chris Davis. Matt Wieters followed those two with a single of his own and it looked like the Orioles might break the game open right from the beginning. But J.J. Hardy struck out after fouling off two meatballs and Henry Urrutia, in his first major-league at bat, struck out to end the inning.    McLouth came up for a second time in the second inning and hit a fly ball to right field. It's no secret that Nelson Cruz is a bit of a liability out there, and he misplayed a fly ball by McLouth into a triple. It was a good hit, don't get me wrong, but Cruz just made a terrible leaping attempt.    With McLouth on third, Machado set to trying to knock him in. He wasn't successful in that task in the first inning, but this time he got it done with a ground ball single the other way that allowed McLouth to easily come in. The biggest blow for the Orioles was their four-run third inning. Adam Jones was the first batter of the inning and he launched a ball to center field for his 20th home run. Davis followed him with a ball that looked like it might get out, but instead fell for a double. It looked like a play that some center fielders would make, but this is the Rangers so Leonys Martin did not.    Wieters walked and Hardy singled to again load the bases for the rookie Henry Urrutia. Ron Washington brought in a new pitcher to face him, a lefty. Urrutia came through with his first major-league hit on a ground ball to right field. Yay, Henry! Old man Brian Roberts followed that with a two-RBI single but was thrown out on the basepaths, then McLouth hit a fly ball to left field that Urrutia was tagged out on trying to score. A disappointing way to end the inning but with the Rangers defense it was worth a shot. Left fielder David Murphy made a good throw to get him. After that, the Orioles decided they were finished scoring. They had a few hits over the rest of the game but never really came close to starting a rally. The Rangers bullpen and Gonzalez traded zeroes until the bottom of the seventh when Gonzalez gave up two hits and a sacrifice fly to lose the shutout. Buck Showalter replaced him with Tommy Hunter in the seventh and while Tommy got Jurickson Profar to end the inning, he wasn't good at all when he came back out for the eighth. Nelson Cruz struck out to start the eighth, but Hunter gave up three straight singles that resulted in two runs scored before he recorded the second out. With two outs Murphy singled in the third run of the inning, officially making the game closer than I like to see. In addition to it being closer than I like to see, it was also now a save situation and another adventurous night for Jim Johnson. Ian Kinsler grounded out for the first out, thanks only to a spectacular play by Machado. Machado charged and barehanded the ball to get Kinsler, which was fortuitous since, after a pop up by Profar for the second out, Johnson gave up back-to-back singles to bring the tying run to the plate in A.J. Pierzynski. As Orioles fans across the land held on to their butts, JJ got Pierzynski to ground out and end the game. That's another series win! Tomorrow the Orioles will go for the sweep with Chris Tillman on the mound verses Martin Perez.

It\'s amazing how much better the rotation looks now that Wei-Yin Chen is back and Feldman is the team\'s fourth starter, even if on a contending club, you\'d love to have someone better in that role. Wade Davis has been pitching a bit better than his ugly 5.89 ERA would suggest, as he has a 4.39 FIP and 4.02 xFIP. He\'s giving up a lot of walks, though - 3.90 per nine innings. The O\'s don\'t exactly draw a lot of walks, but a little patience here could go a long way.

Here\'s hoping Hammel can get the second half off to a good start and make us all (mostly) forget about his first half. If he doesn\'t, at least the O\'s are facing Bruce Chen, who has only made one other start this season, spending most of the year in the bullpen. He somehow has a 2.04 ERA so far, but his peripherals (3.83 FIP, 4.96 xFIP) and the return to the rotation point to some scary regression happening any time now. Maybe hot: Danny Valencia (1.421 OPS, 21 PA), Nick Markakis (1.454 OPS, 19 PA), Adam Jones (.984 OPS, 19 PA) Likely not: Miguel Tejada (.689 OPS, 23 PA) Wednesday, 24 July: Wei-Yin Chen vs. Ervin Santana    Career Numbers Chen vs. Royals Santana vs. Orioles    IP 17.0 82.1   ERA 5.82 5.36   FIP 4.33 5.03   Slash Line (Past Teams) .338/.351/.563 .263/.317/.474   Slash Line (Current Players) .339/.355/.559 .269/.315/.539     Too bad we just missed a Chen vs. Chen matchup. Since coming off of the disabled list, Wei-Yin has picked up right where he left off, with consecutive one-run outings in which he\'s pitched over six innings. His 2.67 ERA for the season is stellar, but I\'m a bit concerned about his low strikeout rate (5.04 K/9, while league average is 7.53) and luck on fly balls (3.6 HR/FB%, while league average is around 10%). He\'s shown the ability to get more strikeouts, as his rate last year was 7.19 K/9, so perhaps it\'s just a small sample size issue, but opposing hitters aren\'t swinging and missing as much (5.8%) as last year (9.1%), either. Meanwhile, Ervin Santana has been quite good for the Royals this year, averaging close to seven innings per start with a 3.18 ERA and solid peripherals. He got roughed up by the Yankees two starts ago, but then two-hit the Tigers over 7.1 IP in his last start. Maybe hot: Brian Roberts (1.058 OPS, 32 PA), Nick Markakis (.973 OPS, 37 PA), J.J.

He\'s on a serious roll in 2013, with a streak of eight consecutive quality starts and allowing just one run in each of his last three. His peripherals (.257 BABIP, 79.7% LOB) make me nervous about regression, but his consistency is astounding. Guthrie made his first start against the Orioles earlier this year, and gave up just two runs over six innings despite allowing ten baserunners. He\'s been struggling of late, only managing two quality starts over his last seven outings. I don\'t like outfielders to play shallow. For the most part, it\'s asking for trouble... The shallow outfield gives up a double or triple in the hope of cutting off a bloop single. To me this doesn\'t make much sense. - Earl Weaver More from Camden Chat:   Matt Garza trade rumors: Orioles could be ""sleeper"" team for the pitcher   Orioles GIFs of the Week   Around the Minors: July 21st, 2013   RECAP: Orioles 4, Rangers 2: Tillman pitches a gem, Orioles get first road sweep of the season.

07/23/2013,"[('Orioles, Brewers trade: Milwaukee Brewers send Francisco ...', "" The Baltimore Orioles have just announced that they have made their second trade of the season, this one for longtime relief pitcher Francisco Rodriguez. In exchange the Orioles are sending minor leaguer Nick Delmonico to the Brewers. Delmonico has spent the entire season so far with the high-A Frederick Keys. Rodriguez, or K-Rod as the kids call him (well, kids in 2005) is a right-handed pitcher who has spent most of his career as a closer. He started the season on a minor-league contract with the Brewers and has gotten into 25 games this season with a 1.09 ERA since being called up on May 16th. His FIP is quite a bit higher at 3.03 but when your ERA is 1, quite a bit higher still isn't bad. Rodriguez is 31 years old, which surprised me because he's been in the majors since 2002. Other than a rough year in 2012 he's always been a reliable reliever and in the mid-2000s was a shutdown closer for the Angels. Nick Delmonico, the player that the Orioles parted with, was drafted in the 6th round of the 2011 draft and while his bat get good reviews, his defense is known to be less than desirable and he's suffered from some injuries. Prior to the 2013 season, Baseball America named Delmonico the Orioles 4th best prospect.    I need to some time for this move to sink in. My initial reaction was that it's stupid, but the more I think about it, I may be coming around. I thought 1) Rodriguez was older, and 2) he was pitching much worse over the last few years than he really was. I'm not the resident minors expert on this site but Delmonico was never been one of my favorites due to the reviews on his defense. So welcome to Birdland, Francisco Rodriguez! Don't screw up.

Slowly but surely, I dragged her into the world of being an Orioles fan in exile (we live in Texas). She's sat with me through numerous evenings in front of MLB.tv, and eventually we made it to Baltimore to visit my family and take in an Orioles game. She wanted to share her baseball journey through this particular lens. * * * I would never really consider myself a true baseball fan. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the dedication, the attention span, the statistical wherewithal, the heart, or the drive required of a real fan. It is really stressful when you start to care about a team! Even with my limited exposure, I find myself yelling at players (who cannot hear me) when they mess up easy plays that cost them the game. I can see myself dividing my friends into people who I can really count on, because they root for the right team, and those who I cannot. I picture myself only wearing certain colors during the baseball season for good luck. As a social worker, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need that extra stress in my life; I am having a hard enough time trying to change the world! However, I can say that I have had true fan moments: when you let everything else go and lose yourself in a baseball experience. Those moments are glorious. A few of mine came when I was younger. I grew up in Atlanta and one of my first baseball memories was learning the Tomahawk Chop at a Braves game at Fulton County stadium. That was the first time that I connected with a large crowd and felt pride in a team. Another came when the Braves won the World Series (I know. Sorry, Orioles) when I was in elementary school. The next day, we all came in wearing our Braves pride on our sleeves. I was part of a community. I had my next big fan moment a bit later when the Boston Red Sox reversed the curse to win the World Series in 2004. (Again, sorry!) I was in college at the time, and my school was near Fenway Park. After the Red Sox victory, thousands of people poured into the streets and ran to the stadium. Everyone was screaming and cheering and crying; perfect strangers were hugging. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what school you went to, how old you were, or where you were from. Your Red Sox fandom superseded all of that. We were a united Red Sox front, and it was amazing to be a part of.    My latest experience with a fan moment was last September at Camden Yards, home of the underrated and full of potential Orioles (yay!). I was meeting my boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s extended family for the first time, and I was super nervous. Before the game, I kept thinking about worst-case scenarios. What if I trip and fall in front of them? What if I say something wrong? What if they decide I'm not good enough for their family? What if they hate my sense of humor? What if I eat the wrong thing? OH MY GOD THIS IS GOING TO BE TERRIBLE. And then the game started. All of my angst fell away as plays started happening and we started cheering. For nine innings, we could bond over being a part of the baseball community and rooting for the greater good of the Orioles. The probing questions and personality assessments could wait. Baseball took precedence. That is the beauty of the game. You can lose yourself in the action, the team, and the community. You become one with the people around you as you cheer and celebrate or boo and cry. I envy people who can live in that world, the true fans. You have something special. I will cherish the few glimpses that I have gotten into that world, and I hope that someday I will have the tenacity (and the blood pressure medication) to join it. In the meantime, I will live vicariously through Ryan, a true O\xe2\x80\x99s fan for life.

07/24/2013,"[('Does Matt Wieters have a long-term contract with the ...', ' The Orioles had the fifth selection in the first round of the 2007 draft. The best pitcher was David Price, selected #1 overall by the Rays. The best position player was a catcher from Georgia Tech by the name of Matt Wieters. A Scott Boras client, he was hailed (by his advisor) as a ""once in a generation"" talent, viewed as a tough sign and he fell to the Orioles. He signed so close to the deadline that the news did not come out until after the deadline. The prospect hailed as ""Joe Mauer with power"" was in the fold with Baltimore for a $6 million signing bonus. Because he signed so late, he did not debut until the 2008 season, when he started out with the high-A Frederick Keys. He was named the Carolina League Player of the Week in his first week as a professional. We were all tantalized by his potential in that monster 2008 season, when, split almost evenly between Frederick and Double-A Bowie, Wieters batted a combined .355/.454/.600. Matt Wieters Facts, exaggerated feats of greatness such as, ""Matt Wieters took batting practice. There were no survivors,"" were shared across the blogO\'sphere, with their own dedicated website helmed by my college pals Daniel Moroz (Camden Crazies) and Ian Oland (now runs a Capitals blog, Russian Machine Never Breaks). The sky was the limit. Going into the 2009 season, Baseball America named Wieters the #1 prospect in all of baseball. He would be turning 23 years old during May of that season. Catchers on the Orioles major league roster were Gregg Zaun and Chad Moeller. The question was not if Wieters would be called up, but when. Should he open the season on the roster? Should he be held back until the Orioles could get an extra year of team control, and perhaps even avoid the expense of Wieters as a Super Two player?    In May of that year, with Wieters hitting .305/.387/.504 in 39 games at Triple-A Norfolk, then-GM-type Andy MacPhail made the decision to call up Wieters. He announced the call-up on the MASN broadcast of a Tuesday game that drew 10,130 paid attendance at Camden Yards. The call-up would be happening days later, debuting Wieters for a Friday game against Detroit. There was rain before the game and a rainbow sprung up over the Warehouse as Wieters took the field for the game. I saw it happen.    He rewarded us with a .288/.340/.412 batting line in 96 games as a rookie, a .753 OPS that hinted at even more as he adjusted to the major leagues. Four years and over 500 games later, Wieters\' career MLB OPS sits at .746. His career high in OPS was a .778 in 2011, a season in which his brilliant defense behind the plate helped him to a 4.7 Fangraphs Wins Above Replacement - a very good player, and, at the age of 25, still with hope of improving. Instead, that has been his career peak at the plate.    While he\'s improved his caught-stealing percentage every year, he\'s never topped the .340 OBP of his rookie year and never slugged above .450. He is not Mauer with power. He is not even Mauer, whose lowest single-season batting average is .287, which Wieters only exceeded in his rookie year. The contract decision set in motion by MacPhail in 2009 is now closer every day. Wieters has two more seasons where the Orioles control him, and after the 2015 season, he is set to become a free agent. The prospect once filled us with dread, with sad ideas of the Yankees or the Red Sox swooping in and plucking two-time-MVP-winning Wieters away from the small-market Orioles with a nine-figure contract. That Wieters never materialized. What the Orioles have instead is a two-time All-Star, two-time Gold Glover whose value to the team is wrapped up solely in his continuing to be a catcher. He remains a Boras client, meaning that the idea of extending him is still remote. It was once a certainty that losing Wieters would be depressing. Now the only depressing part is what might have been. Supposing Wieters was willing to extend with the Orioles, would you want to extend him? If he wasn\'t, would you want to retain his services as a free agent? Fans, including myself, have a tendency to be disappointed by Wieters because he never lived up to the hype. Buster Posey, the hot catching prospect of the 2008 draft, did. He was selected one pick after Brian Matusz, and never seriously considered by the Orioles because they already had Wieters lighting up the minors, and why have two catching prospects? Getting caught up in that disappointment, it\'s too easy to lose sight of the fact that the Orioles still have a solid player at a position of scarcity. In all of MLB, there are only 14 catchers who have been good/healthy enough to qualify for the batting title (3.1 PA/team game). In fWAR, Wieters ranks 6th among these. He\'s squarely behind the likes of Yadier Molina, Mauer, and Posey, and far superior to the likes of Miguel Montero and Ryan Doumit. He has thrown out the fourth-most runners, nabbing 41% of base-stealers - a mark that would be even higher if umpires actually called out some runners who were out. He\'s played in the second-most games. He has never been on the disabled list. He is a markedly better option at catcher for at least half of MLB. He is a significantly better option than anything else the Orioles currently have or are likely to trade for or develop in time for the 2016 season, when Wieters will probably be gone. A lot can happen in two years of baseball, but until something does happen, the position of catcher in 2016 is one that, offensively, could be as much of a black hole for the Orioles as designated hitter is this year. None of the above necessarily means that the right play for the Orioles would be to pay whatever it takes to keep Wieters in Birdland. Wieters will turn 30 in the first year of whatever contract he signs next. If he eschews more years with the Orioles, a desperate team might overpay him in dollars, years, or both. He has been durable in his career so far, but will that continue after two more years of wear and tear on a 6\'5"" frame behind the plate? What about his bat? If a strong second half - when Wieters has a .788 OPS in his career - saves his numbers this year, that still most likely means his pinnacle is the .778 OPS of 2011. Will there be a decline trending with his bat before he becomes a free agent? If not, how long afterwards will it take before any aspect of his game deteriorates enough to make his contract a regret for whatever team might sign him? Posey\'s contract with the Giants is good for an average annual value (AAV) of about $18.5 million. Mauer gets $23 million from the Twins each year through 2018, but this is nuts, and also something they ""had"" to do for their hometown star. Wieters is not to the Orioles what either of these guys are to their respective franchises. Molina might represent the best contract comparison for Wieters: he\'s on a 5-year, $75 million deal that runs from his age 30-34 seasons. He is an interesting case as well because he blossomed as a hitter in his age 28 season, crossing .800 OPS for the first time in that, his eighth big-league season. Before that, his career OPS was .688. He followed that up by putting up even better numbers in 2012, increasing his on-base percentage and slugging significantly. He was always good defensively, which is also the case for Wieters. Molina signed that contract prior to the 2012 season, meaning that when he signed it, he\'d had exactly one season as better than a league-average hitter - 2011. If he was worth $15 million annually prior to 2012, what does that mean Wieters would be worth prior to 2016? His best season is 36 points of OPS below Molina\'s, and he is not trending upward at this time, or even holding steady. Orioles fans should be so lucky to see Wieters suddenly surge offensively as did Molina. If such an improvement in hitting is coming for Wieters, it doesn\'t look to be happening this year. Taking that in mind, as well as steady salary inflation, I would say that a contract to Wieters should come in at a $13 million AAV. Perhaps Dan Duquette could call up Boras in the offseason and try to settle the negotiations in the range of 5 years, $65 million. That would buy out three years of free agency, lock him up through age 32, and set Wieters up for life financially regardless of performance or injury. Wieters could probably get more than that on the open market, given the dearth of even average catching talent in MLB at any given time. If he says no thanks, which he probably would, then good luck to him. The Orioles can go through the arbitration process for two more seasons, offer him a qualifying offer for 2016 that he would probably decline, and then let him go where the dollars flow and collect a draft pick as compensation. Wieters is good, but not great. The O\'s can pay him to be good, which I think he would be for the life of the contract,  but not to be the star that he is not. Perhaps he would end up going to New York or Boston after all. The 2009 versions of all of us would be crushed by that, but we were fans of a losing team and a losing organization then. The Orioles are better now. The playoff and winning season droughts are over. The days of getting overly attached to, and overpaying, players can be over.

The Eutaw Street Corridor: Come in to Camden Yards through the main gates and you\'ll stroll onto Eutaw Street, right past Boog\'s BBQ and Stuggy\'s.  Unfortunately, you won\'t find much in the way of craft offerings out here, with the exception of InBev shill offerings like Goose Island and Leinenkugel\'s.  But wait!  Off to your left -- inside the warehouse -- you can take a turn into Dempsey\'s Brewpub, a full-service restaurant where many of Camden Yards\' more interesting food offerings (bacon on a stick, crab dip waffle fries) originate.  The Brewpub features four house beers (a red ale, an IPA, a wheat beer and a golden ale), which in all truth are solid but unimpressive.  But it also features a solid bottled beer list with something for everyone, making the brewpub worth a stop if it\'s not completely swamped and you have a little time to kill before first pitch.    The Lower Concourse: If you\'re getting into Camden Yards without too much time to spare before first pitch, this is the best place to grab yourself a good beer.  You have two really good options down here.  First, you can stop by the Flying Dog kiosk on the outer edge of the concourse near home plate.  Flying Dog is a Frederick, MD, brewery, and their kiosk is a good place to get the aforementioned crab dip waffle fries at the same time as you grab a Snake Dog IPA, Underdog Lager, Raging Bitch Belgian IPA or Woody Creek White.  Even better, if you come to a Friday night game, Flying Dog brings a cask beer selection to their kiosk, which is a really rare treat for beer snobs at a ballgame (or a chance to drink ""warm, flat beer"" for people who haven\'t gone over the edge yet).  The other option, on the inner portion of the concourse just past Flying Dog, is the Free State Pub, which has about a half-dozen regional craft beers on tap, and several dozen more in bottles. \xc2\xa0If you want options, this is the place to go.    The Upper Concourse: Unfortunately, this is where things get a little dicey, and I know, because my partial season seats are up here.  Once you\'re up on the 300 level of Camden Yards, your options are limited to a small kiosk on the outer concourse for Heavy Seas Brewery (another Maryland brewery, but one whose quality has declined of late, in my humble opinion), and a beer/margarita bar on the inner concourse, whose only craft offering is ... Heavy Seas!  So if you want an ale on the upper deck, you can have Loose Cannon IPA or Loose Cannon IPA, and you can like it. In The Seats: Unfortunately, I have yet to see a beer vendor at Camden Yards schlepping around anything other than the standard selection of lagers.  With the number of quality craft beers that\'s now available in cans, it would be really nice if the vendors in the stands would tote around one token full-flavored beer, even something as simple as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  Alas, if you want a good beer, you\'re going to be getting up for it.    A beer snob wouldn\'t be a beer snob if they weren\'t complaining about something, but the fact is that Orioles fans can drink pretty well at Camden Yards these days, even if they have to hunt out the best selections just a little bit.  My gameday routine is a Flying Dog Snake Dog IPA with crab dip waffle fries to start out, then an Evolution Lot #3 IPA a little later on.  But ultimately, you have choices, and choices are good. What did I miss?  What\'s available on the Club Level, which I never frequent?  What\'s available on that cool rooftop bar above the centerfield flag court, which is always full when I try to go check it out?  Is there anywhere in the park that you can\'t get Bud Light Lime?  Let me know in the comments, and I\'ll update this post accordingly. 2014-2015 updates: Since writing this post, I\'ve confirmed that the center field rooftop bar is a decent place to get a Flying Dog beer (Dead Rise, Snake Dog) and check out a different view of the field during a game. \xc2\xa0For the 2015 season, the team has added a couple of extra craft beer carts to the upper deck, though they\'re all next to one another and still the only options for craft beer in the upper deck.

Encina | The Baltimore SunKANSAS CITY, Mo. \xe2\x80\x94 As the non-waiver trade deadline approaches in a week, the Orioles have become the biggest buyers among American League East contenders, acquiring their second veteran arm for the stretch run Tuesday evening.On Tuesday, the Orioles acquired right-handed reliever Francisco Rodriguez to bolster their bullpen for the second half from the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for prospect third baseman Nick Delmonico.The 31-year-old Rodriguez, formerly one of the top closers in the game with the Los Angeles Angels, was 1-1 with 10 saves and a 1.09 ERA for the Brewers. He has 26 strikeouts in 24 2/3 innings. In Rodriguez, the Orioles get a veteran reliever who can get both left- and right-handed hitters out and work the late innings. var adSkipCounter = 0; \xe2\x80\x9cWe like Frankie Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s experience, especially in pitching in the seventh, eighth and ninth inning,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles executive vice president Dan Duquette said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s done it well. He gives us a little more depth to our bullpen. We really like his changeup, his signature pitch that has had success against left-handed hitters. And he\xe2\x80\x99s a Major League veteran. He has got experience and he\xe2\x80\x99s a competitor.\xe2\x80\x9dRodriguez has held left-handed hitters to a .102/.185/.184 batting line this season. Primarily used as a ninth inning arm with the lead, Rodriguez had not allowed a run in 15 of his last 17 outings, recording seven saves in that span.After playing two seasons with the Brewers, Rodriguez re-signed with the team in mid-April, signing a minor-league deal with a mid-May opt-out clause, but Milwaukee purchased his contract on May 16. Rodriguez had been sharing closer duties with Jim Henderson but has been the primary closer this entire month.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are pretty solid defensively and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some pretty solid players in the lineup,\xe2\x80\x9d Duquette said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were trying to upgrade the pitching to give us a chance to make the run for the AL [East] title and the pennant. So we did what we had to do to help the team now and we have enough players sharing good years at the plate. It\xe2\x80\x99s my hope that we can have a steady stream of prospects going through the system so we can have some that we can trade to supplement the Major League team.\xe2\x80\x9dThe club has been hesitant to deal prospects, but in acquiring Rodriguez, the Orioles had to trade one of their highest-rated farmhands. He was ranked the organization\xe2\x80\x99s No. 4 prospect by Baseball America before this season and No. 5 by MLB.com.Delmonico, the club\xe2\x80\x99s sixth-round pick in 2011, recorded a .244/.351/.371 batting line at Class-A Frederick, hitting 13 homers and 30 RBIs. After playing mostly second base in his first pro season last year, Delmonico made 43 of his 61 starts in 2013 at third base.\xe2\x80\x9cNick Delmonico shows a lot of promise as a hitter, but the major league club needed a little more depth for our pitching staff to accomplish what we want to accomplish this year,\xe2\x80\x9d Duquette said.On July 2, the Orioles traded for Scott Feldman in a deal that sent Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop to the Cubs. The addition of Feldman \xe2\x80\x94 as well as the return of left-hander Wei-Yin Chen \xe2\x80\x94 has fortified the club\xe2\x80\x99s starting rotation.\xe2\x80\x9cWe hope the addition of Frank Rodriguez will be additive as well,\xe2\x80\x9d Duquette said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tough league and a tough division we are competing in. Again, we have a number of position players having good years. I think our pitching needed to be bolstered and that\xe2\x80\x99s what these two trades are trying to do to help make our pitching stronger.\xe2\x80\x9dAs for what is next for the Orioles\' roster, Orioles manager Buck Showalter said after Tuesday\'s loss to the Kansas City Royals, that the team has some options.""I found out about it just before the game,"" Showalter said. ""I\xe2\x80\x99m still kind of taking it in. It\xe2\x80\x99s still something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about a little bit and we decided to go in that direction. \xc2\xa0He\'s a veteran arm down in the bullpen who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of wear and tear on him this season because he started the year late. He\xe2\x80\x99s been in the American League. It\xe2\x80\x99s a positive there and you can never have too many quality arms.""     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

07/25/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Was Chen left in for too long?', 'Wei-Yin Chen pitched a great game for the Baltimore Orioles last night. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7.1 IP, 7 H, 3 R, 0 BB, 3 K. However it might be fair to ask whether manager Buck Showalter left Chen in the game for just a bit too long. With the O\xe2\x80\x99s leading 3-1 in the 8th, Eric Hosmer\xe2\x80\x98s two-run homer tied the game at two. f the result itself is any indication, then yes I suppose that Showalter should have pulled him earlier. However there was no real indication that Chen was starting to tire. While it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to say that perhaps Showalter should have someone waiting in the pen in the later innings, you also don\xe2\x80\x99t want someone warming in the bullpen that ultimately never comes in. I presume that Chen probably said he was fine, and unless he\xe2\x80\x99s starting to struggle or leave balls up that\xe2\x80\x99s all the manager can go on.Courtesy of Jim Cowsert-USA TODAY SportsHosmer hit two homers in the game, as he gave Kansas City a 1-0 lead in the second inning with a solo shot. Ironically, Hosmer also committed an error which allowed Adam Jones to reach base in the fourth. Matt Wieters followed later with a two-run homer, propelling the O\xe2\x80\x99s into the lead at 2-1. The score remained 2-1 until the top of the eighth when Adam Jones grounded into a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice-RBI that scored Brian Roberts and gave the Birds a 3-1 lead. Obviously with Hosmer\xe2\x80\x99s theatrics in the last of the inning, that run was pretty big for the O\xe2\x80\x99s.Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day followed Chen into the game, and for the most part was effective. I was a bit surprised to see that O\xe2\x80\x99Day was sent back out for the ninth inning, especially seeing that the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen seems to be fairly rested. Even in losing efforts last night and Tuesday, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have used a sparing number of relievers. I suspect that\xe2\x80\x99s what Showalter had in mind when he sent Chen back out for the eighth, and even O\xe2\x80\x99Day for the ninth. Granted in O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s case the lead off hitter in the ninth was a righty, and with Brian Matusz warming in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pen it didn\xe2\x80\x99t make much sense to bring in a southpaw at that point. However with a runner on first in the ninth, Alex Escobar lifted a deep shot towards the outfield wall in left. For a moment it appeared that Nate McLouth was going to have a play; when he leaped to catch the ball, it hit off the outfield wall. Lough scored from first on Escobar\xe2\x80\x99s double, and the Orioles had fallen to Kansas City 4-3.Kansas City gave the Birds some problems last season as well, and even earlier this year at Camden Yards. Some teams just match up well against others. For years it seemed that team was the Texas Rangers that gave the Orioles fits. Having said that, one has to hope that the Birds aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking past Kansas City to their big showdown with the BoSox this weekend. (The BoSox who of course are having their own problems this week with Tampa.) The good news is that most four-game series in MLB end up being 2-2 splits, and with a win in tonight\xe2\x80\x99s series finale the Orioles can salvage just that. Miguel Gonzalez will get the start for the O\xe2\x80\x99s tonight, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll face off against former Oriole Jeremy Guthrie. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

So in knowing that the Boston Red Sox were waiting for them at home, are the Birds guilty of looking past what some would deem a lesser opponent? On one hand the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse is full of professionals, and I think that most people would agree that they just don\xe2\x80\x99t seem like the type to look past another team. However on the other hand the results of the series might beg to differ. Furthermore, I would submit that on a certain level it\xe2\x80\x99s human nature to on occasion pull a stunt like looking past an opponent. Is it any different than looking past one\xe2\x80\x99s Friday work load to the weekend?Courtesy of Jim Cowsert-USA TODAY SportsMiguel Gonzalez got tagged with the loss in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game, and Kansas City jumped on him early. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4.2 IP, 8 H, 6 R, 1 BB, 0 K. The zero strikeouts doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t throwing strikes; if anything he was probably taking just a bit too much of the plate. By way of an RBI-double and an RBI-single, Kansas City took a 2-0 lead in the first inning. That was extended to 3-0 on a sac fly-RBI in the second, and Kansas City was also able to put up three runs in the fifth. They spread their run production around throughout the innings, and the Orioles appeared to be a step behind for most of the evening. Perhaps a step behind is a bit harsh, but to say the least they were sluggish.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lone run came in the fifth inning on a Brian Roberts RBI-double, which followed Henry Urrutia\xe2\x80\x98s first ever big league triple. The O\xe2\x80\x99s seemed poised to make somewhat of a mini-rally, as Nate McLouth followed with a sinking liner to left field that was caught by Alex Gordon to end the inning. Had that ball fallen in Roberts would have scored and the inning would have continued. MASN replays were pretty conclusive to the effect that Gordon trapped the ball, so yes that was what one could deem a \xe2\x80\x9cbum call.\xe2\x80\x9d However I find myself in the rare position of taking up for an umpire on this one. While Gordon did in fact trap the ball, it was very subtle (and probably not visible to the naked eye). The umpires were way back in the infield, and quite frankly I can\xe2\x80\x99t blame them for blowing that one. Was it a bum call and did it directly cost the Orioles a run (and perhaps a shot at a legitimate rally)? Absolutely. However this is also the human element of the game. Gordon did a great job of selling the play, and in fact he probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know he trapped the ball \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s how subtle it was. Incidentally, that\xe2\x80\x99s the type of play that instant replay would definitely correct if it were available to umpires in that situation.There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much drama left in this game in the later innings, although Francisco Rodriguez made his Orioles debut in the seventh inning and promptly gave up a homer to Brett Butler. That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of night it was for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, who now find themselves having lost three straight. However the makeup of this team is such that fans probably don\xe2\x80\x99t need to worry too much. Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that they might have taken Kansas City just a bit lightly. But we should also keep in mind that Kansas City played the O\xe2\x80\x99s very tough earlier this season as well as last year. Some teams just match up well against others \xe2\x80\x93 be they a good team or poor. Remember the 2009 Orioles sweeping the defending World Series champion Phillies? That team just matched up well against Philadelphia. To draw a parallel in another sport, it seems that regardless of how good or bad they are, the Maryland Terrapins can always find a way to beat Duke at least once in basketball. Chalk it up to being \xe2\x80\x9cjust one of those things.\xe2\x80\x9dWith that said, this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s series at the yard against Boston is obviously huge. The Orioles need to get themselves back on track quickly as they get prepared to take on the first place BoSox. \xc2\xa0If history is any indication, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be up for the challenge. Chris Tillman will get the start tonight, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by John Lackey. Boston had to tinker their rotation for this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s series after last night\xe2\x80\x99s game against Tampa was rained out. Orioles fans will also find themselves rooting for the NY Yankees again this weekend, as they play Tampa (another team the Orioles are chasing in the standings).

With short-term winning streaks, there is a tendency of fans to become overly optimistic. Yet the same thing occurs with short-term losing stretches \xe2\x80\x93 emotions of fear and panic tug at the baseball fan\xe2\x80\x99s psyche.The challenge is to be balanced \xe2\x80\x93 to fairly look at the situation and place the short-term difficulties accurately within the long-term realities. So let\xe2\x80\x99s try it \xe2\x80\xa6The Orioles record on the road trip \xe2\x80\xa6 and record since the All-Star break is 4-3 \xe2\x80\x93 with a sweep in Texas, yet only winning the opener of the four-game set in Kansas City. Just take the numbers \xe2\x80\x9c4\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c3\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 adding to \xe2\x80\x9c7\xe2\x80\x9d. If a team wins four out of every seven games, that translates to a final record of 92-70. That is possibly enough to squeak into the playoffs. I can be content with this Orioles team ending the first 140 games of the season with an average of 4-3 over every 7 games \xe2\x80\xa6 therefore bringing them to a record at that time of 80-60. That positions them for a run at the playoffs over the final 22 games. Last year they were 78-62 at this point. To make 80 wins at this juncture, they will need to go 23-14 over the next 37 games. That is doable.Birds Watching Observations:Jul 24, 2013; Kansas City, MO, USA; Baltimore Orioles catcher Matt Wieters (32) celebrates with his teammates after hitting a two-run home run against the Kansas City Royals during the fourth inning at Kauffman Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Peter G. Aiken-USA TODAY SportsMatt Wieters \xe2\x80\x93 He has been about the hottest hitting Oriole of late. This is great to see after a lackluster offensive first half. At the same time, it is easy to forget that catchers generally don\xe2\x80\x99t produce the same stellar offensive numbers as, say, the better outfielders. According to STATS, his 59 homers since the beginning of 2011 are the most in the majors. I doubt that most Orioles fans would expect to see that fact.Henry Urrutia \xe2\x80\x93 I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason to not run this fellow out there as the DH pretty much every day \xe2\x80\x93 against lefties, righties, tighty-whities \xe2\x80\xa6 whatever. In my mind, this guy needs to prove he cannot hit rather than the other way around (which was the story with every other Birds DH this year!). After blowing through the minors at .365 and going 7 for 20 here now in his first six games \xe2\x80\x93 throw him out there daily!Manny Machado and Chris Davis \xe2\x80\x93 This is troubling to see the recent offensive drop-off. Yet these things are cyclical, especially for power hitters like Davis. It must drive the hitting coach crazy to finally get someone like Wieters swinging well (and Brian Roberts also), only to see the guys who carried you the first half hit a slump time. Did I ever mention that I\xe2\x80\x99m not a fan of the All-Star game and its effects on players??Pitching Overall \xe2\x80\x93 Apart from last night, the overall starting pitching situation gives O\xe2\x80\x99s fans much encouragement over the not-too-distant past. Miguel Gonzalez has been so solid all year, I would certainly not thrown him under the bus after last evening. There is hope in the big picture that the last third of the season can match the final third of last year \xe2\x80\x93 even without a top-drawer acquisition. The bullpen is certainly strengthened with the addition of Francisco Rodriguez. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not add more at this point to all else that has been written about him joining the squad, beyond adding that I feel Steve Melewski\xe2\x80\x99s column (here) is a perfectly balanced analysis of the situation.Hitting Overall \xe2\x80\x93 While a strength for most of the season, it remains true that good pitching stops the power of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bats. I believe the key to the remainder of the season will be how the O\xe2\x80\x99s handle good pitching against them, even more than the quality of pitching they run out on the mound day after day.So, in conclusion, 4-3 is good, and, don\xe2\x80\x99t hit the panic button, but remember what drawer you\xe2\x80\x99ve stored it within!

07/27/2013,"[('Orioles trade rumors: Jon Heyman says O\'s ""in the mix"" for ...', ' Following the Orioles\' acquisition of Scott Feldman from the Chicago Cubs, Jon Heyman reported that the Orioles were probably ""tapped out"" financially and would be unable to add any further payroll. Tonight, he\'s changed his mind, with a report indicating that sources say the Orioles are ""in the mix"" for Jake Peavy and other pitchers on the trading block. The 2007 NL Cy Young winner is considered one of the top pitchers available as the trading deadline approaches. He has a 4.28 ERA in 13 starts this season. What would it cost to get Peavy? Who knows, but other reports about White Sox trade targets have indicated they are making aggressive requests for trades - things that should probably be far more than the O\'s should pay. Any upgrade over Jason Hammel in the rotation is more than the team has right now, but is Peavy that upgrade? He\'s given up 14 home runs in 80 innings and the Orioles already have their share of pitchers that can do that. A 1.14 WHIP is not bad at all, but it\'s a lot of salary to take on. Peavy is making $14.5 million this season and next, so the Orioles would be on the hook for all of next season\'s salary and the rest of this one\'s while giving up prospect(s), possibly top prospect(s), from their thin minor league system. Heyman also notes that Ervin Santana of the Royals and Bud Norris of the Astros are available, without any specific information tying the O\'s to those players. The same is true for Cliff Lee, who could end up getting traded from Philadelphia, if their GM stops thinking that they are buyers. Lee is making $25 million each of the next two seasons after this. The Orioles may be ""loosening the pursestrings"", as Heyman puts it, but do they have that much in the purse?    Santana would be a free agent at the end of the season, while Norris would be under team control through the 2015 season and getting increasingly expensive in arbitration. Santana was most recently seen by Orioles fans shutting the team down, and with a 3.06 ERA in 138.1 innings this season, he\'s been one of the best starters in the AL. Norris has a 3.93 ERA with a 1.41 WHIP. No thanks. How much smoke is there behind this rumor? Who knows? If there\'s one thing I\'ve learned about trade rumors, it\'s that 95% of them or more amount to nothing. Maybe the O\'s are willing to add payroll but not part with prospects. Maybe they aren\'t even willing to add payroll. Maybe they\'ll trade for Lee out of left field - laying in the weeds, if you will - but probably nothing will happen. The trade deadline is July 31, so you\'ve got three days left to dream, Birdland. Maybe the Orioles will actually win a game before then and keep themselves in the race.

', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Hall of Fame: Do any current Orioles stand a chance of ...', ' The Baseball Hall of Fame holds its induction ceremony this weekend on its grounds in Cooperstown, New York. There is no greater illustration of the difficulty of being a good enough baseball player to earn induction than the fact that no one was elected in the Baseball Writers Association of America balloting this year. That fact is controversial in and of itself, with a significant voting bloc of obstinate members, some of whom have not regularly covered baseball in a long time, standing in the way of induction for many of the greatest players from recent years. It\'s not easy to play your way into the ""automatic"" benchmarks like 3,000 hits and 500 home runs, or for pitchers, 300 wins. Orioles fans have not seen a Hall of Fame induction since Cal Ripken Jr. was elected in 2007, and unless Mike Mussina is elected in the next few years and is chosen to wear an Orioles cap (which is another subject for another day), it will be a long time until another Oriole might be selected. Do any current Orioles stand a chance of playing their way into the Hall of Fame by the time their careers are over?    This post assumes that reaching the automatic benchmarks is the only way a player will earn induction. It\'s possible that as the electorate changes, more lenient standards will evolve, especially for players in the PED testing era. Walks may start to mean more than hitting arbitrary numbers of hits.    It\'s also possible, if even more unlikely, that someone on the Orioles could have a strong enough peak to warrant consideration. Nick MarkakisAge: 29MLB seasons: 8 One thing about making it into the Hall of Fame is that you probably need to start young. Markakis had this going for him at one time, making his major league debut and getting significant playing time in his rookie season at the age of 22. He had 516 hits before he turned 25 years old and recorded 188 and 187 hits in the next two seasons, meaning that he only would have needed another eleven seasons like that to reach 3,000 hits some time in the 2023 season.    There was a time where Markakis was hitting a lot of doubles. This could have been his calling card. 600 doubles is ""automatic"" in the sense that the top 14 doubles hitters of all time have 601+ and they are, or should be, Hall of Famers. Pete Rose, who is banned, and Barry Bonds, who may as well be, are the only non-Hall of Famers. Markakis averaged about 41 doubles per season over his first five seasons, meaning he would have only needed another ten seasons like that to get to some magic number. Once, there was hope Markakis\' doubles would turn into home runs. He now no longer even hits doubles at any sort of remarkable pace. Barring a significant improvement in his 30s that would allow him to remain in the game for another decade, he has no chance. Adam JonesAge: 27 (turning 28 on August 1)MLB seasons: 8 Jones made his MLB debut in 2006, getting small amounts of time at the big league level in Seattle in both 2006 and 2007 before being traded to the Orioles as part of the Erik Bedard trade. It\'s barely even worth considering him as a 3,000 hit player because he does not even have 1,000 hits. Since 2010, he\'s had a per 162 game average of 182 hits, which is a pace that would only take him 16.5 seasons to reach 3,000 - if he played 162 games and if he continued to hit 182 a season. Adding the hits he got before age 24 shaves that down to a little more than 15.5 seasons, meaning if he maintained that pace, he\'d get 3,000 hits around age 39. There\'s always an outside chance, but it\'s hard to get to 3,000. Even the active player closest to 3,000 hits (Alex Rodriguez) might not, though there are plenty of other reasons Rodriguez\'s candidacy might be torpedoed. Could Jones end up with 500 home runs? Sure, if he has another 12 seasons and change where he hits 32 home runs like he did last season. He\'s on pace for 35 this year, which would get him there in 10 seasons and change, counting this one. That would probably happen around his 38th birthday. Jones has two Gold Gloves and has been selected to three All-Star teams. Voters have liked that kind of hardware, along with MVP awards. He could earn more of the first two, but probably not enough to impress the curmudgeons. Manny MachadoAge: 21MLB seasons: 2 The young Machado, as MLB.com\'s Brittany Ghiroli likes to refer to him, has been, through his first season and change of big league action, everything that Orioles fans could have hoped for and more. He has 135 hits through 104 games of the 2013 season, putting him on pace for about 210 hits on the season. Count the 50 he notched in his rookie season at the age of 19 and Machado only needs 13 more seasons at the same pace as this season to record 3,000 hits. This would happen when he was 34 years old. Machado is so young that his pace could fall off a little and he would still have a chance, but even so, the odds are not in any player\'s favor to keep up such production for 15 seasons. That\'s what makes Hall of Famers what they are. They are the greatest. Machado could certainly end up being one of the greatest. He\'s already getting named along players like Al Kaline as far as greatest players do to things before turning 21. We get to watch his beginning, and hopefully the whole rest of what will look more and more like a Hall of Fame career as well. Chris DavisAge: 27MLB seasons: 6 Hard as it is to believe, Davis only had 77 MLB home runs prior to this season. If he hit home runs at the same pace as the 2012 season, it would take him 12.8 seasons (including this one) to reach 500 home runs. He would be 40 years old at that time. Davis is a late-bloomer, and those sorts of players don\'t get into the Hall of Fame unless they keep going at a high level into their 40s. Again, players do not tend to do this. Davis is on pace to end this season with 57 home runs. That would only take him 6.5 more seasons to reach the  500 home run plateau at that pace. If he returned to hitting 33 home runs per year after this hypothetical 57 home run season, it would take him 11.2 more seasons to hit 500 home runs. He would be 39. That\'s not going to happen, but it would be kind of awesome if it did. Chris TillmanAge: 25MLB seasons: 5 You probably just laughed at seeing Tillman\'s name on this list. That\'s just how hard it is to be a pitcher and be good enough for the Hall of Fame. 300 wins? Tillman had 16 career wins heading into this season. He had thrown a total of 266.2 innings across parts of four seasons - he was never good enough to stick for a full season until now. He\'s already at his career high in MLB innings with 126.2. He never threw more than 100 at the MLB level before this. Tillman has started 21 games and has won 13. Barring injury, he will make every start this season and should end up with 32 starts. If he keeps winning games at this pace, he\'d be a 20-game winner (rounding up). He would only have to average 20 wins per season for another 13.2 seasons to get to the 300 win mark, meaning he would be 39 years old. Tillman started young, but he wasn\'t good enough at that young age to really get a leg up into this discussion. On the other hand, Randy Johnson hung on until he was 45, and didn\'t have his first 200+ inning season until he was 26. The Big Unit\'s first great season was at age 29, so maybe... The last Orioles 20-game winner was Mike Boddicker in 1984. ** If Markakis somehow managed to play until age 40 (the 2024 season), get 3,000 hits, retired, and then was inducted into the Hall of Fame five years after he retired, that would be the year 2030. I will turn 47 years old later that year. So will Markakis. All of which is to say that, whether or not Mussina gets inducted into the Hall of Fame, we\'re going to be waiting a while for the next Oriole. Maybe one of our current favorites will beat the odds and do so. Just don\'t hold your breath.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

He sounds good enough to the Orioles to at least fuel this tweet from Buster Olney:  One of the players BAL has talked about internally is Carlos Quentin of the Padres, who is signed through 2015 for about $24m guaranteed.\r \xe2\x80\x94 Buster Olney (@Buster_ESPN) July 28, 2013    The phrase ""talked about internally"" could mean a lot of things. It could mean that the Orioles are really serious about making some kind of offer concerning the Padres slugger, or it could just mean that Dan Duquette was laughing around a water cooler and said, ""Yeah, Quentin would look great in an Orioles uniform,"" and then that was characterized as an internal discussion. Quentin turns 31 next month and he has two years remaining beyond this year on his contract. That would be $20.5 million guaranteed beyond this year, with a $3 million buyout on a $10 million mutual option for 2016. In an eight-year career, Quentin\'s slash line is .255/.351/.492. He\'s averaged 31 home runs per 162 games, but he has never played more than 131 games in a single season, and played only 86 games for the Padres last season.    A player who can slug over .500 in the wasteland that is Petco is probably worth that salary for the Orioles, but what would it cost to get him in trade? There is no indication that the Orioles have even called the Padres to find out what San Diego would want for him. Notably, one year ago, it was another Padres player the Orioles were considering at the deadline. That was Chase Headley, because the Orioles had a huge void at third base, but they decided to say screw that trade nonsense and called up Manny Machado. That worked out pretty well.    In his career, Quentin hits lefties and righties equally well, so he could just be the DH, no platooning needed. Against right-handed pitchers, his career OPS is .845 and against lefties it is .837. He also has a no-trade clause in his contract, so he would have to waive that in order to come to Baltimore, even supposing the Orioles would pay whatever the Padres wanted for him. That would probably be a significant cost given that there\'s two years beyond this of Quentin to come. As far as the no-trade clause, the Orioles being a playoff team last year and a winning team this year should make them a more attractive destination than in the past.    Recent reports have indicated the Orioles may be more aggressive in trading prospects and taking on salary than was first indicated. If that is serious, then Quentin is a player who may be worth targeting, though there is always the risk of injury, and possibly the risk of decline as he moves into his 30s. At the very least, it would not be paying for a rental. Dream if you like about acquiring a player with a .366 on-base percentage and a .500 slugging percentage while playing half of his games in Petco, but don\'t get too excited. The standard for trade rumors is that most of them amount to nothing, and ""talked about internally"" isn\'t even a full-blown trade rumor. It\'s something, though. The Orioles may very well decide to forego the prospect and salary cost and go with L.J. Hoes and Henry Urrutia. That probably won\'t work out as well as the Machado decision last year, but you never know. More from Camden Chat:  O\'s 0, Red Sox 5: Shut Out at Home Orioles news: L.J.

The Baltimore Orioles right-hander simply isn\xe2\x80\x99t performing well enough to win. Such was the case Sunday against the Boston Red Sox, when Hammel allowed three runs over 5 1-3 innings in a 5-0 loss. When he walked off the mound in the sixth inning, Hammel was doomed to lament yet another winless outing. He\xe2\x80\x99s 0-6 with a 5.63 ERA in 10 starts since May 27. \xe2\x80\x9cBaseball\xe2\x80\x99s not fun right now for me. It\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m making good pitches at times and they\xe2\x80\x99re getting hit, and the bad ones they\xe2\x80\x99re letting go. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way the ball rolls sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d Although he yielded six hits and a career high-tying five walks, Hammel gave the Orioles a shot at winning. Unfortunately, Baltimore couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do a thing against nemesis Jon Lester, who allowed four singles over seven innings. \xe2\x80\x9cThe big emphasis, what I look at, is we didn\xe2\x80\x99t score any runs,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t mount much of anything offensively.\xe2\x80\x9d David Ortiz went 4 for 4 with his 20th home run as the Red Sox won the pivotal matchup of the three-game series. They had lost six straight series to Baltimore since a four-game sweep in July 2011. As a bonus, the Red Sox took a half-game lead over Tampa Bay, which lost to the Yankees. Boston stood atop the division for 60 straight days before a defeat at Camden Yards on Friday night ended the run. Mike Napoli had two doubles and an RBI for the Red Sox, and Jarod Saltalamacchia broke the game open with a two-run single in the eighth. Lester (10-6) struck out eight, walked two and did not allow a runner past second base. The right-hander improved his lifetime record against the Orioles to 15-2, although he lost his previous two decisions against them. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve always been a tough team to pitch against,\xe2\x80\x9d Lester said of the Orioles. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve always had a great offensive lineup. Our guys did a good job today with (Orioles starter Jason) Hammel, making him work and giving me a couple of runs, giving me a cushion to work with.\xe2\x80\x9d On Saturday night, Ortiz shattered the casing of two dugout phones with his bat after being ejected from the game. On Sunday, he opted to take his swings at Baltimore pitchers. Asked if he took a different attitude into the game because of his outburst on Saturday, Ortiz replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s the opposite. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t get out of your game. Sometime when you get excited it gets worse. Just go out there like I normally do.\xe2\x80\x9d Ortiz hit a two-run shot off Hammel (7-8) in the third inning to put Boston up 3-0. Big Papi has 12 consecutive 20-homer seasons, the last 11 with Boston. Only Ted Williams, with 16, had more as a member of the Red Sox. Ortiz also had three singles, tying his season high in hits. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter taking it out on the phone \xe2\x80\xa6 he took it out on the baseball today,\xe2\x80\x9d manager John Farrell said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was good to see.\xe2\x80\x9d With Ortiz and Lester leading the way, the Red Sox got a coveted victory. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially in this situation where we are fighting with Tampa for first place,\xe2\x80\x9d Ortiz said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something we need.\xe2\x80\x9d Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Davis went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts. He has not added to his major league-leading home run total of 37 since July 14, and he has struck out in 22 straight games \xe2\x80\x94 including 10 in the last four games. It was only the fourth time this season the Orioles have been blanked, tied with Tampa Bay for lowest in the AL. Blame it on Lester. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get with him,\xe2\x80\x9d leadoff hitter Nick Markakis said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a battle. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t locating his pitches the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him. But he was still effective, especially with guys on base.\xe2\x80\x9d Hammel needed 27 pitches to get out of a rocky first inning. After a two-out RBI double by Napoli put runners at second and third, Mike Carp struck out. Ortiz made it 3-0 in the third with an opposite-field drive to left following a single by Jacoby Ellsbury. NOTES: In the makeup from Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s rainout, Red Sox LHP Felix Doubront (7-4) will face Rays LHP David Price (5-5). \xe2\x80\xa6 Baltimore recalled OF L.J. Hoes from Triple-A Norfolk and designated pitcher Jairo Asencio for assignment. Hoes went 0 for 3 in his third major league game. \xe2\x80\xa6 Boston improved to an AL-best 20-11 in day games. \xe2\x80\xa6 Baltimore fell to 9-5 in the pivotal game of a three-game series. \xe2\x80\xa6 Napoli has had multiple extra-base hits in 11 games this season. \xe2\x80\xa6 Ortiz has reached base in 32 of his last 34 games.

07/29/2013,"[('Orioles trade rumors: Dylan Bundy said to be available ...', ' Dylan Bundy is out for the season and most of next season after having gotten Tommy John surgery. This does not make him immune from his name being randomly tossed into the mill that is trade deadline speculation. After a flurry of weekend stories from the usual MLB reporting suspects that tipped the Orioles as an aggressive team heading to the July 31 deadline, Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports keeps that rolling with this tidbit:  In any case, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 aggression is notable. Sources say the team is even willing to move one of its top prospects, right-hander Dylan Bundy, for the right return.  Now that you\'re done screaming in horror, remember my standard rule: 95% or more of trade deadline rumors amount to absolutely nothing. This percentage becomes even greater as the deadline itself approaches, as reporters who are expected to write cast about to say anything. We do not know what sources Rosenthal spoke to who indicated Bundy\'s availability, and we do not know what led those sources to say that. It is possible he talked to Dan Duquette, who convinced him that the Orioles would trade Bundy. It is possible he talked to a couple of random scouts who got drunk with an Orioles scout who, in his inebriation, proposed a trade scenario.    Bundy\'s name could have been leaked out of a sincere interest in moving him in a big package, or it could have been leaked as part of a plan to get a GM with a top player - say, Giancarlo Stanton of the Miami Marlins - to call up Duquette and start the conversation with, ""Well, if Bundy\'s available..."" Yet those GMs may find the same thing that you would find if you went looking for the cheapest used car advertised in a newspaper ad: that car is not available, but why don\'t you look at some of the other merchandise while you\'re here?    What kind of trade return would the Orioles have to get for you to not freak out about Bundy being traded? One trade that Rosenthal offers as pure speculation - keying off the Orioles\' previously-reported interest in Jake Peavy - is Bundy for Jake Peavy and Gordon Beckham. Take a minute and go vomit. That\'s the only reaction that trade hypothetical deserves. You\'ll feel better.    While this hypothetical Bundy trade is not good, there are plenty of players where we would gladly wave good-bye to Bundy in order to acquire them. Bundy should be untouchable, more or less, but if the Angels called and offered Mike Trout for Bundy, you would take that in a heartbeat. Bundy for Stanton? Same thing. The other teams would never make those trades, but the Orioles should trade Bundy if, somehow, the ""right"" deal came along. It probably won\'t, because most trade deadline trades involve short-term rentals for stretch pushes - like the Orioles\' previous trade of Nick Delmonico for Francisco Rodriguez - but that does not always have to be the case. Even among the top tier of prospects, there is attrition of pitchers. The quartet of Jake Arrieta, Zach Britton, Brian Matusz, and Chris Tillman has turned into one starter in the Orioles rotation - and him still with question marks, though he did make that All-Star team. We\'ve always wanted to believe Bundy and Kevin Gausman would be different, but that doesn\'t mean they will. There is always the chance Bundy would be at his most valuable to the Orioles as a trading chip. The biggest reason to not want a trade of Bundy at this point is his injury recovery would probably lower his value, meaning a ""good"" trade for the Orioles is less likely to be offered. Trading Bundy right now would not be selling high. They should not move Bundy for any marginal upgrade - especially not the one Rosenthal speculated about - and I don\'t think that they will. With the list of players being said to be shopped by teams who are selling, the Orioles should not be making any more trades at all. For better or worse, they\'re stuck with the team they\'ve got. They are a successful team with frustrating flaws, just like everyone else. More from Camden Chat:  Camden Chat\'s first half GIF tournament!

07/30/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Time to get well (Houston starter updated)', 'Make no mistake about the fact that if the Baltimore Orioles look at the coming stretch of schedule in the manner in which I\xe2\x80\x99ve described it in the title, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to lose their next eight games. Under no circumstances can you ever take anybody lightly when playing a sport at any level, lest you\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to get yourself beaten. However the fact is that the next eleven games provide the Orioles with three different sub-.500 opponents. Tonight the Birds open up a three-game series with the Houston Astros, this weekend the Seattle Mariners come to town for three games, and on Tuesday the O\xe2\x80\x99s will head to San Diego for a brief two-game set with the San Diego Padres, before a three-game series in San Francisco.Again, you can\xe2\x80\x99t take anyone lightly (least of all the defending world series champions). Furthermore, the Orioles have struggled against sub-.500 opponents this year (see last week\xe2\x80\x99s series in Kansas City). However if the records mean anything (and they don\xe2\x80\x99t), this is an opportunity for the Birds to indirectly make up for this past weekend\xe2\x80\x99s series against Boston. (Speaking of which, the BoSox also play Seattle this week.) If the O\xe2\x80\x99s can take at least two-of-three in each series (perhaps splitting the San Diego series), things will look a lot different than they did in the immediate aftermath of Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s loss to Boston. Obviously the big white elephant in the room remains tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s trade deadline (4 PM), so we don\xe2\x80\x99t know at this point what the Orioles will look like after that time.Interestingly, tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Houston starter (Bud Norris) is a guy in whom the Birds have expressed interest over the course of the past month. Might we see one of those bizarre sequences where a player switches club houses? On a side note, trades can bring us really strange scenarios at times. There are been situations where that\xe2\x80\x99s in effect happened, most recently last season when Seattle traded Ichiro Suzuki to New York while the Yankees were playing them at Safeco Field. Perhaps my favorite trade story is that of Joel Youngblood, who was traded from the Mets to the Montreal Expos in August of 1982. Youngblood hit a two-RBI single in an afternoon game at Wrigley Field against Chicago for New York before being lifted in the third inning. He was promptly told he had been traded to Montreal, and left the ballpark immediately to fly to Philadelphia where the Expos were playing the Phillies. He arrived in time to hit a seventh inning single for Montreal, making him the only player in big league history to get two hits in two different cities for two different teams on the same day.I would suspect that Norris won\xe2\x80\x99t be coming to the Orioles so long as Jake Peavy is still with the ChiSox. If the O\xe2\x80\x99s are unable to land him today, then they might look to options like Norris. The prevailing thought is that Peavy will get traded sometime before the beginning of play tonight, as he\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled to start for the ChiSox in Cleveland. Granted the deadline is tomorrow, however it would behoove Chicago to move him prior to making his start so that in theory he could start at will for his new team. The Orioles will start Wei-Yin Chen opposite of Norris tonight\xe2\x80\xa6as of right now.Update:\xc2\xa0Houston has scratched Bud Norris from his scheduled start tonight, and the speculation is that he\xe2\x80\x99s about to be traded. Some national writers are saying that Pittsburgh is a possible landing spot, however over time the Orioles had been rumored to be interested in Norris as well. We\xe2\x80\x99ll find out at some point once whatever deal the Astros are working on becomes official. Lucas Harrell will take Norris\xe2\x80\x99 spot in the rotation against the O\xe2\x80\x99s tonight. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Unfortunately for the Baltimore Orioles and the San Diego Padres, the teams that acquired them, the chances that either player makes much of an impact this season are slim.Norris drew quite a bit of interest as the ace of a bad Houston Astros staff. A right-hander, he has a fastball that averages 92.4 miles an hour, according to FanGraphs, and he can push it into the mid-90s in certain situations. But his adjusted earned run average is just 4 percent better than the league average, and he has been demolished by left-handed hitters. Photo       Ian Kennedy, whose numbers have declined, may benefit from a move to San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s Petco Park.  Credit             Matt York/Associated Press           Moving to the Orioles and the American League East, Norris will have to face off with left-handers like David Ortiz and Robinson Cano, and he will have to adjust from the zero-pressure atmosphere of Houston to a race for one of two wild-card spots in the A.L., where the Orioles are clinging to the second spot by half a game over the Cleveland Indians.Norris will initially take the rotation spot of Jason Hammel, who was placed on the disabled list on Thursday with tightness in his forearm. While Norris should fill that role well, his place in the rotation when Hammel returns is unclear, and there is a possibility he will become a power arm out of the bullpen. A decent stopgap, Norris is not the type of player expected to push Baltimore over the top.Kennedy, a former top prospect of the Yankees who won 21 games for Arizona in 2011, may feel like the more established starter of the two, but both pitchers are 28 and are under team control until 2016. Kennedy, having seemingly come into his own in 2011, when he threw 222 innings, striking out 198 and finishing fourth in the National League Cy Young voting, took a step back last season, and his statistics across the board have declined steeply this season.The Padres, who hold a 2 percent chance of making the postseason, according to the Web site CoolStandings.com, probably see Kennedy as capable of helping them in 2014 and 2015, but they will have to be prepared to open the checkbook. Kennedy, who is eligible for arbitration after this season, is likely to command a substantial raise from the $4.265 million he will earn in 2013, and pitching in the friendly confines of Petco Park, he could see his numbers improve significantly.

Most of these things were related -- the team's record in one-run games, its otherworldly bullpen, its record in extra-inning games and its win-loss record being outrageously higher than its Pythagorean record (based on run differential).  All of those factors really tied back to the same massively lucky stretch that the Orioles had in the first half of 2012, and they haven't translated into failure in 2013 because this year's club overall looks more like the post-All Star Break club of 2012 (which actually played to its talent level) rather than the mostly lucky first-half team. But another insidious narrative was also lurking around the edges of the commentariat, and it had to do with the starting rotation.  Around the corners of the internet who closely monitor such things, a common thread emerged that several Orioles' starters had been lucky or unlucky in 2012, and were due to regress or improve this year simply based on a return to the statistical mean. Ever since Billy Beane and the Moneyball A's famously exploited a market inefficiency by noticing that ballclubs undervalued walks and extra-base hits, a statistical movement in baseball has emerged to look for the next glaring weakness in baseball analytics.  When it comes to pitching, the common application of these techniques is to look past ERA (the results on the field) and instead focus on factors like batting average on balls in play (BABIP), left on base percentage (LOB%), groundball-to-flyball ratio (GB/FB), and the like -- many of which are encapsulated in fielding-independent pitching (FIP) and expected fielding-independent pitching (xFIP), ratios designed to resemble ERA but to take luck out of the equation.  The theory goes, then, that pitchers with an ERA below their FIP/xFIP are likely to regress, while pitchers with an ERA above their FIP/xFIP are likely to improve naturally.  And guess what?  This theory was wrong (at least partially) about every single member of the 2013 Orioles' Opening Day rotation.  Let's take a look at them, one by one.  All 2013 stats are as of Monday. Jason Hammel 2012 ERA/FIP/xFIP: 3.43/3.29/3.46 2013 ERA/FIP/xFIP: 5.20/5.09/4.67 Of all the unexpected contributions to the 2012 Orioles starting rotation, the sabermetric crowd would have had you believe that Hammel's 2012 performance was legit.  His FIP and xFIP were essentially in line with his real results; he had discovered a new two-seam fastball that apparently enabled him to finally pitch to his true potential.  His K/BB, GB/FB and BABIP numbers all supported the notion that Hammel was a sustainably good pitcher.  And yet, so far in 2013, Hammel has gone back to a below-average pitcher who coughs up too many longballs and doesn't strike out enough guys.  The stats that were specifically designed to flush out fluky single seasons said that Hammel wasn't having a fluky single season.  He was.    Chris Tillman 2012 ERA/FIP/xFIP: 2.93/4.25/4.34 2013 ERA/FIP/xFIP: 3.62/4.71/4.11 I'm going to give the advanced stats partial credit on this one; they forecast that Tillman would regress from his 2012 performance, and he has, a little bit.  However, he hasn't fallen back to nearly the point of his FIP or xFIP in either season.  Tillman illustrates one of the key failings of these advanced statistics, which assume that all home runs are created equal in terms of their likelihood to allow runs to score, when in fact Tillman has a propensity to yield solo homers.  Whether this is because Tillman pitches better from the stretch than the windup, or because he focuses and executes better under pressure, he seems to be demonstrating at least some prolonged ability to defy regression to FIP's mean.    Wei-Yin Chen 2012 ERA/FIP/xFIP: 4.02/4.42/4.34 2013 ERA/FIP/xFIP: 2.78/3.70/4.72 The effect is least pronounced with Chen, but once again FIP and xFIP asserted that Chen got at least a little bit lucky in 2012.  This demonstrates another failing of xFIP in particular -- it dislikes flyball pitchers like Chen, assuming that all flyballs are equally likely to be turned into home runs, when in fact the eye test can show that Chen excels at inducing medium-distance flyballs that aren't particularly scary.  For a more pronounced version of this effect, check out Darren O'Day, who has a career xFIP more than a run higher than his actual ERA, because he makes a living out of inducing weak pop-ups with his rising fastball. Miguel Gonzalez 2012 ERA/FIP/xFIP: 3.25/4.38/4.63 2013 ERA/FIP/xFIP: 3.69/4.27/4.34 If you're thinking that I'm picking on FIP unfairly in my first three examples, here's where it really starts to come into question.  Adherents to the notion that FIP can predict regression were wildly insistent that Gonzalez was skating by on smoke and mirrors, whether it was due to a lack of available scouting, the inability of the league to adjust to his pitching or just sheer luck.  In 2013, we were led to believe, Gonzalez would be first in line to fall back to earth (just ahead of Tillman).  No such thing has happened.  The only bump in the road for Gonzalez has been a short DL trip for a blister, aside from which, he has turned in consistent, #2-starter-like production, managing to keep opponents out of big innings without showing flashy stuff.    Jake Arrieta 2012 ERA/FIP/xFIP: 6.20/4.05/3.65 2013 ERA/FIP/xFIP: 7.23/4.60/4.86 If you think I've demonstrated that FIP and reality have their squabbles, here's where FIP cheats on reality with reality's sister, and reality burns all of FIP's stuff in the front yard while the neighbors watch in awe.  Jake Arrieta, said FIP, got screwed over by a big heap of bad luck in 2012.  FIP saw Arrieta's rising strikeout rate, falling walk and home run rates, high BABIP and low strand rate and said that he had the ultimate hard-luck season, with all of his hard hits and home runs just randomly coming at the most inopportune times.  Unfortunately for those of us who actually watch baseball, it was obvious that the distribution of these events was in no way random, and that Arrieta had a tendency to serve up a juicy meatball whenever it mattered most.  His BABIP was high because he gave up lots of hard contact, and his strand rate was low because he did it most with men on base.  So it was no surprise to a lot of us when Arrieta's 2013 didn't simply snap into line with his FIP or xFIP, even if we were really rooting for it to do so. =========================================== I'm sure this little illustration will cause some to lump me in with the anti-science/anti-math crowd, so let me be clear: I don't hate advanced statistics as such.  Baseball has come a long way from using batting average, pitcher wins, RBIs and saves in a vacuum, and that's happened in large part because a statistical community has emerged to demonstrate that players can add value to ballclubs in ways that don't always show up in those luck/team-based traditional stats.  But for a new peripheral-based stat (like FIP or xFIP) to displace a reliable one that reflects actual results resultsbetween the lines (like ERA or ERA+), it needs to demonstrate that it can outperform that statistic with some consistency, in terms of either reflecting or predicting a player's actual value better than the old statistic.  The fact that FIP and xFIP failed to do so not once or twice, but with every single member of the Orioles' 2013 rotation, tells me that they're not there yet. I'm not a deep statistical mind; I can't tell you every detail of why FIP and xFIP aren't working as they're supposed to.  Some have surmised that it's due to the league-wide increase in strikeouts.  FIP and xFIP place a high premium on Ks, this logic says, and if the league starts to accept Ks from more and more of its hitters, FIP might overvalue mediocre pitchers who strike out a lot of guys.  This seems valid to me, in addition to the arguments I made above that FIP undervalues flyball pitchers who can regularly keep the ball in the park, and refuses to acknowledge that pitchers may respond differently to high-leverage situations or pitch with different amounts of skill from the stretch or the windup.  As it stands, I spent much of 2012 intrigued by the relationship of the Orioles staff to FIP, and until I see more players' reality start to resemble their FIP, I'm going to say that it's not the Miguel Gonzalezes of the world who get by on smoke and mirrors -- it's the stats that are used to put those very pitchers down.

The deal was finalized quickly in part because the Detroit Tigers were eager to protect themselves in case shortstop Jhonny Peralta is suspended for his involvement in the Biogenesis performance-enhancing drugs scandal.""The frank reality is that I do not know what is going to happen with Jhonny, but with this move, we now feel well protected if there is a long suspension,"" Tigers general manager David Dombrowski said.With all eyes on the Yankees because of Alex Rodriguez\'s likely suspension by Major League Baseball for his role in the wide-ranging drug case, New York never could work out a deal with the Phillies for corner infielder Michael Young, who is staying \xe2\x80\x94 for now \xe2\x80\x94 with Philadelphia.San Francisco also held onto left-hander Javier Lopez and the Los Angeles Angels kept second baseman Howie Kendrick after sending Alberto Callaspo to Oakland late Monday.Other than a few other minor swaps Wednesday, baseball\'s executives did much of their work in the weeks leading up to the 4 p.m. EDT non-waiver trade cutoff.""In general I just think everybody was dealing with a relative level of frustration knowing that the strength wasn\'t there, the bona fide help, per se, across the board was going to be very tough to fulfill their needs,"" Giants general manager Brian Sabean said after the deadline passed.The busy Cubs sent Alfonso Soriano to the Yankees, Matt Garza to Texas, Scott Feldman to Baltimore and Carlos Marmol to the Dodgers. Francisco Rodriguez, Marc Rzepczynski, Callaspo, Scott Downs and Jesse Crain also switched teams this month.The NL Central-leading Pittsburgh Pirates, St. Louis Cardinals and the struggling World Series champion Giants were among several teams that chose to stand pat Wednesday in a tepid market.In the midst of a revival that has an entire city brimming with Bucs fever, Pirates general manager Neal Huntington reluctantly held back from making any deals.""We talk a lot about, we don\'t want to do something stupid,"" Huntington said. ""We were willing to do something stupid, we just didn\'t want to do anything insane.""Teams can make trades for the rest of the season, but it gets riskier. Players must first pass through waivers, meaning they can be claimed by another club before a deal takes place.For a player to be eligible for the postseason with his new team, swaps must be completed before Aug. 31.On Wednesday, Houston also sent outfielder Justin Maxwell to Kansas City and the Dodgers picked up backup catcher Drew Butera from Minnesota and sent him to the minors.Also, Seattle traded minor league infielder Robert Andino to the Pirates for a player to be named or cash.The young Astros, with the worst record in baseball at 35-70, dealt reliever Jose Veras \xe2\x80\x94 to Detroit on Monday.Norris only had to walk down the hall to join his new team with Houston in Baltimore. Outfielder L.J. Hoes, one of two prospects sent to Houston, was initially in the Orioles\' lineup but ended up getting the start for the Astros. Class-A left-hander Josh Hader was the other player in the deal.A 28-year-old right-hander, Norris helps fortify a rotation that will be without injured Jason Hammel for at least the next two weeks.In his fifth big league season, Norris is 6-9 with a 3.93 ERA in 21 starts this year. He has a lifetime record of 34-46 and is under team control through 2015.""I\'m excited for the future,"" Norris said. ""I pitched my way into this situation to be traded and help out a team. This (Baltimore) team is a young club, they know how to contend. They had an amazing year last year. I just want to be any piece of the puzzle I can to help this team keep pushing to the World Series.""Baltimore began Wednesday five games back of Boston in the AL East and in the second wild-card position.The Diamondbacks have fallen 3\xc2\xbd games behind the surging Dodgers and needed lefty relief help. Thatcher is 3-1 with a 2.10 ERA in 50 games this season. He has limited left-handed batters to a .215 average.""It\'s exciting to get traded. It\'s a big deal. It brings excitement to be in a pennant race,"" Thatcher said. ""That is all you ask for, is to win. I\'m looking forward to getting over there and helping out and doing whatever they need from me.""The Diamondbacks also got 23-year-old right-hander Matt Stites, who is 2-2 with a 2.08 ERA and 14 saves in 46 games with Double-A San Antonio.Kennedy, 21-4 two seasons ago, is 3-8 with a 5.23 ERA in 21 starts and hasn\'t won a game in two months.He\'s expected to start Sunday at Petco Park against the New York Yankees, the team that took him in the first round of the June 2006 draft. ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Orioles 6, Astros 3: Bud Norris solid in debut, Chris ...', "" The trade was a disaster. Couldn't the Orioles get L.J. Hoes back? Why did they trade for this scrub? These were the thoughts as Bud Norris allowed a pair of solo home runs to left-handed batters over the first four innings of the game. Meanwhile, the Orioles were shut out through four innings by Astros starter Jordan Lyles. That could not hold for long. In the fifth, they finally broke out against Lyles and Norris suddenly looked a whole lot better. They picked up three runs on the way to a 6-3 victory to record the series victory against the lowly Houston team that hammered them the night before. For the first time in eight games, the O's managed to get ten or more hits. That is a good way to lose some games against teams you should be beating. The first nine of those hits, and all of them allowed by Lyles, were singles, and they could not get much going until the fifth. Indeed, through four innings they had only three hits and no walks, and it looked like another night of frustrating futility. Then, the fifth inning happened. Cuban sensation Henry Urrutia, tonight's designated hitter, grounded a ball down the third base line for a single. He was nearly erased on a would-be double play ball by Brian Roberts, but Astros shortstop Jonathan Villar muffed the ball and Urrutia motored to third. That turned the lineup over, with Nate McLouth and Manny Machado each adding RBI singles. It was a Jake Arrieta kind of inning for Lyles: the meltdown after a teammate's mistake. When Nick Markakis added an RBI sacrifice fly, it was 3-2 Orioles and the damage had been done.    Lyles created his own kind of mess in the sixth inning when he allowed a two-out rally to the bottom of the lineup. J.J. Hardy opened things up with a single to left. Urrutia added a soft liner past the second baseman into center field and Roberts lined a single of his own into left field, which scored Hardy. It was a good night for the Orioles going first-to-third, with two runs coming from heads-up baserunning of that sort.    That chased Lyles, who ended up his night with 5.2 innings pitched, nine hits, five runs, three earned, with five strikeouts. McLouth tagged him with another run when reliever Travis Blackley gave up a single that scored Urrutia. Meanwhile, there was Norris, the high-profile trade acquisition, making his Orioles debut when he had been terrible both away from Houston and on 6+ days of rest - he rested seven going into tonight. He quickly revealed his challenge in getting out lefties when he gave up a home run to .218 hitter Brett Wallace, the kind of fat pitch that you could have hit for a homer if you stood there and closed your eyes and swung.    Right fielder Marc Krauss, a .200 hitter, added another such home run in the fourth inning, which left the Orioles trailing 2-0 at that point. Norris looked worse because of the O's failure against Lyles, but that turned around, and Norris pitched his way to a quality start in which he only ended up allowing two earned runs on four hits and two walks in six innings. That is a WHIP of 1, and there is no doubt we would take that from any end of the Orioles rotation every night of the week and be happy about that. The two home runs were troublesome, especially given that Norris will face tougher lefties in the AL East, but he otherwise kept runners from scoring position and managed to strike out eight hitters, a new season high. The strikeouts are not all that impressive when you consider that the Astros have struck out over 1,000 times this season, which leads the major leagues by over 70 over the second-place team. The Orioles have 748 strikeouts as hitters this season, which you may be surprised to know is only 23rd in MLB. No more insurance was ultimately necessary, but Chris Davis provided some when he added to Baltimore's homicide total by murdering a baseball in the bottom of the seventh inning. Blackley missed and Davis crushed the pitch to right field. It was the kind of strong pull swing you'd expect from a power hitter like Davis. The home run was his 39th of the year, giving him his 100th RBI of the year. That is the 39th such season (100 or more RBI) by an Orioles player in history, with the last being Markakis in 2009. This statistic stunned me because it's hard to remember Markakis hitting well enough to have 100 RBI. He has done so twice in his career, also in 2007. Davis' home run was the only extra-base hit the O's would get on the night. Sometimes, that's all you need. Jim Johnson came on for the ninth inning and he was very Jim Johnson. A walk to Wallace was followed by Krauss being hit by a pitch - though he shook his hand and I never saw him hit there - brought the tying run to the plate with one out. Johnson flubbed what could have been a game-ending double play ball, but he recovered enough to at least get Jimmy Paredes at first base. Matt Dominguez, who has 14 home runs on the season, stepped up to the plate with two outs, and visions of disaster may have danced through your heads. The disaster was not to be tonight: Dominguez grounded a ball to Machado, who fired to first to end the game and give Johnson his 37th save. He now has more saves than the Astros have wins. Norris earned the win to raise his record to 7-9, 1-0 as an Oriole. Lyles took the loss to drop to 4-5. Hoes recorded his first major league hit in the game, a line-drive single into left field. He still got a cool career moment in the ballpark of the favorite team of his youth even though he was traded to another team. McLouth, Machado, Davis, and Urrutia all had multi-hit games for the O's. Every starter had a hit except for Matt Wieters, whose OBP is back under .300, and Markakis, now slugging .385 - 66th in the AL among qualified hitters. The Orioles will welcome Seattle, a complete failure of a baseball team, who allowed six runs in the bottom of the ninth to blow a game in Boston Thursday night, to Baltimore for a three-game weekend series. They will avoid Felix Hernandez and Hisashi Iwakuma. Chris Tillman will face off against Aaron Harang in the 7:05 opening game on Friday night.

For the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 sake, hopefully that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what they do. Otherwise they\xe2\x80\x99re going to find themselves having dropped two-of-three to the team with the worst record in the majors. First off, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to win games when you don\xe2\x80\x99t score any runs. However starter Miguel Gonzalez wasn\xe2\x80\x99t helped any by the circumstances in the game. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 3.2 IP, 9 H, 9 R (4 earned), 2 BB, 5 K.Gonzalez certainly lacked luster on most of his pitches, however J.J. Hardy committed a two-out error in the fourth with the bases loaded, which was followed up by a Castro grand slam. Prior to that the Orioles still trailed 4-0, however there\xe2\x80\x99s a big difference between being down 4-0 and 9-0 in terms of the game being within reach. A game is always a team effort (win or lose), so this is not to pin all of this on Hardy either. (Again, no chance of victory if the bats don\xe2\x80\x99t even put up one run.)Almost overshadowing the game result itself was the trade that sent Bud Norris to the Orioles and L.J. Hoes to Houston. This was one of the stranger trade deadline day swaps, with both players literally just switching clubhouses. Hoes was initially in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup in left field, and when he got to the Houston clubhouse he found himself in their lineup (in right). As I said yesterday these kinds of trades happen in baseball, however it certainly was interesting to have a player drive from his home to the ballpark (parking in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 players lot) finding out he was traded, switching clubhouses, playing for his new team against his old one, and then driving home.Courtesy of Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsBirds Watcher staff writer Randy Buchman\xc2\xa0looked at some of the fans\xe2\x80\x99 reactions to the Norris/Hoes trade yesterday afternoon.

Even though Hoes was with the big league club at the time of the trade (and make no mistake about the fact that he was probably called up so as to say that big league talent was involved in the trade), however I think most fans still saw him as a prospect. Many people are wary about parting with prospects at all. I would tend to agree with those people in some respects, however I also know that you have to give up quality to get quality.Most of the industry experts seem to think that it was a good trade for the Orioles, and that they gained more in Norris than they lost in Hoes. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing; Hoes\xe2\x80\x99 future in Baltimore probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too bright. As an outfielder he was behind the likes of Jones, Markakis, McLouth, Pearce, and perhaps even Nolan Reimold. That made him expendable, and thus he was worth more to the Orioles on the trade market than on the field or in the dugout. I suspect that if not for the trade yesterday Hoes would have been optioned back to Norfolk at some point for Steve Pearce, only to re-emerge in Baltimore in September once rosters expanded. However in Houston now he\xe2\x80\x99s in a situation where a team is looking to meld it\xe2\x80\x99s way into the future, and odds are he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to play much more regularly at the big league level.As for the Orioles, they\xe2\x80\x99ll start Norris against his former team in tonight\xe2\x80\x99s series finale at Camden Yards. I have to wonder how strange it was for him to return to Houston\xe2\x80\x99s team hotel after last night\xe2\x80\x99s game with his former teammates. But that\xe2\x80\x99s part of what happens in trades like this! Norris isn\xe2\x80\x99t Jim Palmer by any stretch of the imagination, however in looking at his potential one can see his 3.93 ERA going down a bit with the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 defense behind him (withstanding last night). As I said yesterday, one thing that can\xe2\x80\x99t be overlooked is that Norris is under team control until after the 2016 season. So this is hardly a rental such as the Joe Saunders trade last year. Norris is a guy that figures into the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 future, which was a big reason that he was attractive to them in the first place.Whether or not the trade is truly a success or not is not something that will be tangible tonight after the game. Nevertheless, Baltimore will get it\xe2\x80\x99s first taste of Bud tonight (yes folks, that was purposely done!) against Houston. (You want me to go futher?!\xe2\x80\xa6the Astros used to be known as the \xe2\x80\x9cHouston Colt 45\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d That was of course a reference to the gun company, but as we know Colt 45 is also a malt liquor!) He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Houston\xe2\x80\x99s Jordan Lyles. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      While the Yankees continue to say that they are proceeding as if Rodriguez will join them, perhaps as soon as Monday in Chicago against the White Sox, the Rodriguez spectacle is at the moment obscuring a more immediate concern: whether Jeter and Granderson can return to form, and how long they will take to get there.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The same can be said for their erstwhile ace, the left-hander C. C. Sabathia, who has been one of the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 few healthy stalwarts but has hardly pitched like one.Sabathia struggled with his command once again, as well as his poise, in Friday\xe2\x80\x99s 7-2 loss to the San Diego Padres. Sabathia, who had hoped to turn his season around after the All-Star break, has instead been worse. He allowed five runs, a season-high-tying 11 hits and has failed to make it through the sixth inning in his three starts since the break. He has allowed 19 runs in those starts.Sabathia compounded his troubles with a pair of mental lapses \xe2\x80\x94 walking in a run after reacting emotionally to a 2-2 borderline pitch that was ruled a ball, then failing to cover first base on a ball hit to the right side.

C. if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make a run.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees had arrived here with a modicum of momentum, having beaten the red-hot Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday and having survived a gantlet of strong teams, having seen the Boston Red Sox, the Texas Rangers, the Tampa Bay Rays and the Dodgers since the All-Star break. They also might have been buoyed by a rare sellout crowd at Petco Park, made up of a large contingent of Yankees fans.But instead of making up ground, they fell four games behind the Baltimore Orioles and the Rangers for the final wild-card berth and eight and a half games behind the American League East-leading Red Sox as the Padres smashed three home runs out of their pitcher-friendly park.Sabathia was not the only catalyst who continued to struggle. Jeter, though he hit a single to right in his first at-bat and lined out in his final one, is now 2-for-14 since belting the first pitch he saw upon his return for a home run. More concerning, he continued to show the range of a 38-year-old in the field, twice struggling to reach ground balls and then making hasty, errant throws. He did not look graceful on the bases either. Still under orders not to cut loose running the bases with a tender quadriceps, Jeter nevertheless headed from first to third on Robinson Cano\xe2\x80\x99s first-inning single to right in what appeared to be third gear. When the play was closer than Jeter expected, he slid clumsily into the base but did not injure himself.

If you guys can think of a player who has played this game that\xe2\x80\x99s never struggled, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see it.\xe2\x80\x9dThere was at least some encouragement in Granderson\xe2\x80\x99s return. He looked better in each at-bat: striking out, tapping back to Andrew Cashner and turning on an inside fastball that ended up in fitting fashion: in the glove of first baseman Yonder Alonso, who stepped on first for a double play that ended the sixth. He struck out after a competitive at-bat against Tim Stauffer in the ninth.In the field, Granderson bobbled one ball but recovered to throw a runner out. In the field and at the plate, he looked like a player searching for his footing. When\xc2\xa0Logan Forsythe ripped a line drive over his head, Granderson retreated and then faced the wall, preparing to play the carom.

If the Yankees don\xe2\x80\x99t get more help and soon from the likes of Sabathia, Jeter and Granderson, never mind an unlikely boost from Rodriguez, that vision of a Yankees outfielder waiting, waiting, waiting might come to represent a playoff race that is also going, going, gone.   Correction: August 5, 2013   An earlier version of this article misidentified the Padres player who hit a home run over Yankees left fielder Curtis Granderson.

08/05/2013,"[('Birds Watcher: Baltimore Orioles: One pitch too many', 'As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, starting pitchers generally have ten good starts, ten poor, and ten in between over the course of a season. Furthermore, the success or failure of your season will generally lie in those ten \xe2\x80\x9cin between\xe2\x80\x9d starts; if you can get a pick-me-up from your teammates you can win most of those games. However the issue comes when you turn in a good start where you still end up on the wrong side of the scoreboard. Chen pitched a spectacular game; Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7 IP, 5 H, 3 R, 3 BB, 5 K. In fact, he far out-pitched his opponent, former Oriole Joe Saunders. The O\xe2\x80\x99s had Saunders on the ropes a few times, yet even when it looked like they had delivered a knockout blow he managed to swoop in and pick up the win.The Baltimore Orioles went 0-for-11 with runners in scoring position yesterday, which partly attests to their struggles. However defensively their struggles with this Seattle ball club and doubles seemed to continue. Michael Morse led off the second inning with a double, which was followed by a Raul Ibanez RBI-double to put Seattle ahead 1-0. However that was the only run that was allowed in the game\xe2\x80\xa6for quite some time. Part of the madness from the perspective of Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 fans is that Chen was incredibly economical with his pitches in the early innings. In the fourth inning he was still in the 30\xe2\x80\x99s while Saunders\xe2\x80\x99 pitch count was up in the 60\xe2\x80\x99s. Yet a few elongated Seattle at-bats (aided by multiple pitches being fouled off along with home plate umpire Brian Gorman\xe2\x80\x99s rotating strike zone) caught Chen up in a sense.The Orioles hit a lot of balls hard in this game, but they seemed to continually be at someone. In the fifth Seattle employed a shift on Manny Machado, effectively giving him a double down the right field line. Machado indeed went to right field\xe2\x80\xa6right to the right fielder. With the number of guys that got on base you did have the thought that the Orioles were preparing to break through at some point, and in fact they did. Steve Pearce drew a walk in the sixth, which was followed by a Danny Valencia homer. Valencia had been called up from Norfolk yesterday morning after reliever Steve Johnson was optioned to triple-A. (Ironically I suspect that Valencia will be optioned back to Norfolk today when Brian Roberts comes off the paternity list.) That gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 2-1 lead, and they appeared to have Saunders on the ropes. In a way you kind of had to feel badly for Saunders; while he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t pitched a gem by any means he did hold the Orioles at bay for most of the afternoon, and it seems that he was almost hung out to dry in a way by being left in.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsBut don\xe2\x80\x99t feel too badly for Saunders. It was pretty evident that the sixth was going to be his final inning. One felt that the same might have been true of Chen as well, yet the O\xe2\x80\x99s had planned to send him back out in the seventh. He began by striking out Justin Smoak, and then proceeded to walk Michael Saunders on four straight pitches \xe2\x80\x93 most of which weren\xe2\x80\x99t even close. That brought Brendan Ryan to the plate, along with his .188 average. That should explain why Saunders (who had torched the Birds for most of the series) was pitched around, and in fact it was a sound decision on the part of Buck Showalter (assuming that\xe2\x80\x99s what happened). To top it off, Chen picked Saunders off of first base, recording the second out of the inning. He had Ryan struck out on what should have been a called strike three, but Gorman decided not to give Chen the inside corner of the plate that Saunders got all day.Ryan ended up walking, which brought catcher Henry Blanco to the plate with his .172 average. Ahead 0-2 in the count, Chen caught too much of the plate and Blanco hammered the ball out of the park to give Seattle a 3-2 lead. While Chen finished the inning, there was the impression that he threw one pitch too many, which cost him and the Orioles the game. This was a tough one to lose for the Birds because now they have to head out west following a day off (travel day) today. It also makes the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 road a bit tougher in the push for the playoffs, as they fell 6.5 games out of first place and 1.5 games out of the final wild card spot. However August was when they made their big move last year, and if you recall they had a long west coast trip last September as well. Both Boston and Tampa are heading west along with the Birds, so those teams will have the strains of travel imposed on them also.

08/07/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Hometown boy makes good', 'Speaking for myself, I feel that there\xe2\x80\x99s always something special about our roots. Not everyone feels that way, but I do. I think that Adam Jones does also, and he certainly gave himself the hero\xe2\x80\x99s welcome back in his hometown of San Diego last night. Jones went 4-for-4 in the game with a homer and two RBI, to help lift the Baltimore Orioles to a 4-1 victory over San Diego. Starter Bud Norris won his second game as an Oriole; Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 6 IP, 5 H, 1 R, 2 BB, 5 K. Norris and Jones are two of six Orioles with strong Southern California ties, the others being Scott Feldman, Miguel Gonzalez, Chris Tillman, and Brian Matusz.Nate McLouth led off the game with a double to right field, and following a Manny Machado pop out he stole third. After Jones was down 0-2 he managed to work the count full and then send an RBI-single up the middle to give the Birds an early 1-0 lead. However after Chris Davis legged out an infield single, Jones was caught in a rundown between second and third, which in effect got San Diego off the hook. Presumably Jones was unaware that Davis was safe at first, which is why he was so far off the bag at second. Nevertheless that ended the inning, and the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 shot at a multiple runs early on.Courtesy of Peter G. Aiken-USA TODAY SportsHowever Jones quickly atoned for that mistake. He led off the fourth with a solo home run, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s led 2-0. There had to be a little extra spring in his step as he rounded the bases, knowing that he grew up in that city and so forth. San Diego got to within 2-1 as Chris Denorfia scored on an RBI-single in the last of the sixth, but that was as close as the Orioles allowed it to be. Jones once again figured into the scoring picture when he singled in the eighth, promptly stole second, and then scored on Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 RBI-double. That gave the Birds a 3-1 lead late in the game, a lead that was extended to 4-1 on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-single in the ninth. Jim Johnson came on to close out the game in the ninth, and allowed a one-out single. However the following batter grounded into a double play, and the Orioles had themselves a 4-1 victory in San Diego to open up an eight-game western road trip.For the record pitcher Bud Norris took two turns at the plate under National League rules, going 1-for-2 in the game. Traditionally Oriole pitchers seem to do relatively well at the plate in these interleague games, a comment that\xe2\x80\x99s headlined by Zach Britton\xe2\x80\x98s first career homer at Atlanta in 2011. Norris of course spent time as an NL pitcher when Houston was in the National League, so he\xe2\x80\x99s swung the stick before. Scott Feldman is the team\xe2\x80\x99s best hitting pitcher\xe2\x80\xa6according to Scott Feldman. Speaking of which, according to Buck Showalter Feldman will pitch either Monday or Tuesday in Arizona. He\xe2\x80\x99s being pushed back with multiple off days this week.For the record, Adam Jones tied a career high going 4-for-4 in last night\xe2\x80\x99s game. He\xe2\x80\x99s 8-for-15 lifetime in games played at San Diego, so while Baltimore is now his home and will be for the foreseeable future, it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that he turns it up a notch when he has the rare opportunity to play in his true hometown. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that\xe2\x80\x99s unique to Jones, as I feel that quite a few athletes play well when their franchises play in their hometowns. Nevertheless, this short two-game series continues and concludes late this afternoon in a 3:40 PM eastern time start. The Orioles will send Miguel Gonzalez to the hill in the wake of two lackluster starts. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be pitching in a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s park in Petco Field, so that might give him a bit of an edge. Gonzalez will be opposed by Eric Stults of San Diego.

""I just came from a baseball family. My Dad used to play baseball and my Mom played softball and my brother played baseball."" stated Liddi. When it comes to Liddi\'s first baseball memory he noted playing ball in the backyard with his older brother who is now 32.  When asked about his baseball role models, Alex replied he looked up to ex-Brave Chipper Jones and ex-Mariner Ken Griffey Jr. Unknown to many, Liddi is the first born and raised Italian player to compete in the Majors. Liddi was inked as a non-drafted free agent by the Seattle Mariners on September 9, 2005. Alex looked back on his initial deal saying, ""I was so happy. It was a dream come true to be able to come to the States and play baseball."" After trucking away in the minors for three plus seasons, Alex got the call that every boy dreams of. The 225-pound infielder was a September call up for the Mariners in 2011.  Liddi glanced back on his first call up saying, ""It was the last day of the Triple-A season and everyone was telling me that I was going to get called up. I was really anxious and at the last moment I got the call."" His first big league tilt was against the Los Angeles Angels. Stepping into the box, he locked his sights on Jerome Williams. Liddi shared what was going through his head stating, ""I was trying to stay calm and get the hit."" Italy may not be a baseball powerhouse, but Liddi has dressed and played in three World Baseball Classics. The right-hander shared his thoughts on representing Italy stating, ""It\'s something special, something unique, and being able to represent your country at the highest level. So I was really proud to be there.""    As far as a favorite baseball game he played in, the infielder plucked a game against team Mexico during a World Baseball Classic.  ""In the first game, we beat Mexico in the Classic. We were down by two in the last inning and we won when Sergio Romo was on the mound."" shared Alex on his favorite baseball moment. Along with playing infield the Baltimore farmhand has stood guard in the outfield in the majors, but according to Alex he would rather play in the dirt than on the grass. Just like all athletes, Liddi has his strengths. Liddi battered about his strengths stating, ""My defense and being able to drive in runs is always the thing I focus on."" Liddi is focused and dialed in at the plate for the Tides having 7 multi-hit tilts to date (8/5/13) and 11 of his previous 24 hits have been good for extra bases. If he keeps up the pace, he could find himself in the line-up again this September with an MLB club.

Having lost eight of the previous 12 games \xe2\x80\x93 including painful series with the Royals and Mariners \xe2\x80\x93 these wins are exactly what the doctor ordered.This west coast trip began with the Birds playing exactly .500 baseball over the past 44 games since June 14th.\xc2\xa0 That is not going to get them into the playoffs. Currently, the Orioles are on pace to win 89 games, whereas it will likely take something like 92 or 93 victories to gain a spot.Aug 7, 2013; San Diego, CA, USA; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Chris Davis (19) is congratulated by shortstop J.J. Hardy (2) after a three-run home run during the eighth inning against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park. Mandatory Credit: Christopher Hanewinckel-USA TODAY SportsThe good news is that this is very doable. Even though the Birds are at this point in the 4th spot of wildcard teams vying for the two positions, the Orioles are actually two games ahead of their record at this point last year.There are 20 games yet in August (9 home / 11 away) and 28 in September (14 home / 14 away). There are critical games to be played against the two teams marginally ahead of them at this point \xe2\x80\x93 three contests at home with Oakland and three in Cleveland. As well, the Orioles have seven games with Tampa Bay and nine with Boston.There are two trains of thoughts (perhaps slow moving freight trains?) rumbling through my mind right now that strike me as critical for an Orioles return to playoff opportunities. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean these to be exhaustive/inclusive \xe2\x80\xa6 simply a couple of ideas that seem especially significant from where I sit and watch.1.\xc2\xa0 Will I See You In September?These remaining 20 games in August are tremendously critical. The Orioles need to hang tight with or surpass Oakland, Texas, and Cleveland, while staying within striking distance in the AL East.I believe the September call-ups and expanded rosters help the Orioles more than their opponents \xe2\x80\x93 for two reasons. The first reason is Buck Showalter and his ability to generally milk the most out of his roster. Giving him more options makes him more dangerous. The second reason is that I believe the Orioles to have better players with greater experience in that first handful or two of personnel who are just beyond the 25-man limit imposed during the first five months.Think of it this way: how many times have Orioles fans seen the game begin to fall apart in the sixth inning? It happened just today.\xc2\xa0 Much of this is due to the need to seek to have the starters go deeper into games and not wear out the bullpen. Having additional pitching options allows for a quicker hook \xe2\x80\xa6 without endangering the back half of the pen. Ultimately the Orioles are going to need starters who can go 20 or 21 outs on a consistent basis, but that is not where the team is at right now.Likewise, there are more options for pinch-hitting and pinch-running scenarios. And yes, other teams gain the similar increased options, but not to the extent of the Orioles \xe2\x80\xa6 in my freight train mind!2.\xc2\xa0 M.R. Ducks and RBIs with RISPDid you get that? If you are a true Marylander, that did not confuse you at all! Well, for those Orioles fans from outside the state, let me explain \xe2\x80\xa6M.R. Ducks is the name of a popular restaurant in Ocean City. It was a name chosen many years ago by the founder of the business, a Mr. Lewis, who remembered the Eastern Shore accent of some good old boys out duck hunting. The conversation in the duck blind went like this, \xe2\x80\x9cM.R. Ducks!\xe2\x80\x9d (Them are ducks.)\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cM.R. not Ducks!\xe2\x80\x9d said the second fellow, to which the former replied, \xe2\x80\x9cO.S.A.R. C.M. Wangs!\xe2\x80\x9d (Oh yes they are; see them wings!) \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cL.I.B\xe2\x80\xa6M.R.Ducks!\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles tend to win the games when A.R.Ducks on the pond of 2nd and 3rd base, and they get RBI-ed in those RISP situations. The Birds were 0 for11 in the most recent 3-2 loss to the Mariners on Sunday, whereas they were 8 for 25 the past two days.Honestly, the point is bigger than simply the offence doing its job of scoring runs consistently and maximizing opportunities, it involves each part of the team coming through in a majority of critical situations faced. It means that starters need to minimize damage and work out of difficult situations (as Norris did so well on Tuesday), and the relievers need to strand inherited runners and stop whatever bleeding has begun. And to be thorough, we need to mention the importance of defense, which has been incredible at historic levels!It seems obvious, and maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m not being more analytical than merely drawing attention to the stuff of \xe2\x80\x9cno-brainer\xe2\x80\x9d baseball categories, but the Orioles need to play and win as a team over these final 48 games. The offense cannot be depended upon to simply outscore opponents, because good pitching does stop good hitting. But neither is the pitching the lone answer; the hitters need to find a way to score off even the best throwers in the game \xe2\x80\xa6 and they are going to be seeing many of them.I keep my own set of statistics that I call the \xe2\x80\x9ccredit and blame\xe2\x80\x9d stats \xe2\x80\x93 tracking which part of the team (win or lose) deserves either the credit or the blame. Early in the season, the offense was certainly credited with the bulk of the wins, while pitching (starters or relievers) got the blame more often for losses. When each part of the team does their job, it goes down as a team win. It is interesting to see that in the current time, when the Orioles win, it is almost always a team win. I believe this demonstrates in some small way that the organization may well be putting the pieces together for another successful finish to the remaining 30% of the season. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Three Orioles ranked as having best tools in Baseball ...', ' Who is the person with the best power in the American League? If Baseball America\'s recently-unveiled Best Tools rankings are any indication, that person is none other than Orioles slugger Chris Davis, who leads the universe in home runs. The survey, in which big league managers voted on a variety of categories, was released Tuesday and also saw J.J. Hardy singled out as the best defensive shortstop in the AL and Adam Jones as having the best outfield arm in the AL. Praise from MLB managers does not exactly add up to a hill of beans in this crazy, mixed-up world, but it\'s another indication that in these popularity contests, much like in All-Star voting, the Orioles now have some measure of popularity. It\'s amazing what one surprising winning season followed up by another winning season will do. Does Adam Jones have the best outfield arm in the AL? Well, no, probably not, but he hit his 23rd home run Tuesday night, and that was awesome. Those inside the game do not always judge the players the same as those outside of it, as reflected in the Gold Glove awards, among other things. Jones being a two-time Gold Glove winner does not make him a great defender. I will now play the violin for whatever more deserving player was not named in this meaningless survey. It is a tiny violin. Hardy\'s position as the best defensive shortstop in the survey is far more defensible. UZR or DRS quantify what our eyes already tell us, which is that he is great. As with his winning the Gold Glove last year, it\'s possible he is not the greatest, but he\'s close enough that it is not embarrassing for those voting that they named Hardy the best. He\'s not doing quite as well this year, but it beats the heck out of Freddie Bynum being out there.    The Baseball America survey listed the top three in each of its chosen categories, and while only the three above Orioles were named the best, others appeared in the top for the AL. Those include:     Nick Markakis (best hit-and-run artist, 3rd) Davis (most exciting player, 3rd; best power, 1st)  Matt Wieters (best defensive catcher, 2nd)  Manny Machado (best defensive third baseman, 2nd; best infield arm, 2nd) Jones (best defensive outfielder, 2nd; best outfield arm, 1st) Hardy (best defensive shortstop, 1st) Buck Showalter (best manager, T-2nd)  What does best hit-and-run artist even mean? If it means best at hitting weak grounders to second base, then I can see how Markakis would qualify. Markakis is often cited as a ""good bat control guy"" - the old-school prototype of the #2 hitter who\'s going to bunt or hit-and-run over the leadoff hitter who has reached. The merit of this is up for debate. He is 68th in the AL among 85 qualified batters in slugging percentage. Machado ranked behind Adrian Beltre in both categories. By UZR (Ultimate Zone Rating, which measures a player\'s range, arm, and errors against the average player), Beltre was worth +10 runs saved in the field last season. This year, he is worth +0.6, which means he is basically average, as you might expect to suddenly happen for a 34-year old corner infielder. Machado is worth +19.8 runs this season. So the same effect that inflates Jones keeps Machado from his due.    Who cares what these idiots think, anyway?  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
08/08/2013,"[('Orioles trade rumors: ""Most aggressive team in waiver ...', "" With the moves they made prior to the non-waiver trade deadline, the Orioles signaled that they would be active in trying to improve the team and their position in the standings. As the conversation has shifted to the waiver trade deadline, the O's continue to be active in a different way, according to ESPN's Buster Olney:  BAL said to be most aggressive team in waiver claims:They're playing goalie in front of Boston/Tampa Bay/wc contenders, blocking everything.\r \xe2\x80\x94 Buster Olney (@Buster_ESPN) August 8, 2013    The month of August is the revocable waivers trade period, which means that most teams place players on waivers just to gauge interest and see who is claimed and who isn't. If no team claims a player, they can be freely traded to any team. If a team claims a player, then the two teams can either work out a trade, the team can just give up the player, or they can pull the player back. Waiver claims are given priority in reverse order of the standings, which means, as Olney notes, that the Orioles are in a position to block any move that they feel would improve one of the teams that they are chasing in the wild card or division races.    For instance, yesterday there were reports that Mark DeRosa of the Blue Jays had been claimed on waivers, but today the same reporters announced he had been pulled back from waivers, meaning that Toronto and whatever team claimed him were unable to work out a deal. If, hypothetically, the Orioles were the claiming team, perhaps they never had any interest in working out a deal, and merely felt that they should prevent DeRosa from going to a contending team ahead of them. There is some risk in a strategy of aggressive waiver claims, because a team that wants to get rid of a bad contract could potentially just decide to let a player go. This happened between the Jays and the White Sox with Alex Rios, who was simply allowed to be claimed and the Blue Jays were out from under the contract. Coming full circle, reports today indicated that Rios had again been claimed on waivers, perhaps by the Rangers, who, with Nelson Cruz suspended, could have genuine interest in an upgrade in their outfield. The Orioles are behind the Rangers in the wild card chase, so if they were following the aggressive pattern indicated by Olney, they could put a claim on Rios just to keep Texas from upgrading. The White Sox could then pull him back or let him go to the Orioles for the waiver claim fee, putting the O's on the hook for the rest of his salary. They are already covered in the disappointing overpaid outfielder department.    It's also possible that Dan Duquette could be out there looking for the right trade to bolster a weak area of the team, although this seems less likely. However, last year's acquisition of Joe Saunders was a waiver trade, so you never really know when the right move could fall into place and work out just fine.

Detroit Tigers (67-45) @ Cleveland Indians (62-52), 7:05 The Indians sit one game behind the O's in the race for the second wild card spot. The O's, themselves, are 1.5 games behind Texas. Zach McAllister gets the start for Cleveland against Cy Young favorite Max Scherzer, who is going for his 17th win of the season against only one loss. Pitcher win-loss records are not the be-all, end-all, but when you're having a 16-1 season with a 2.85 ERA, you're having a good year. A Tigers victory sends the team chasing the O's in the wild card race a little farther back. Boston Red Sox (70-46) @ Kansas City Royals (58-53), 8:10 Bruce Chen has a 2.03 ERA on the season and not too long ago he stymied the Orioles offense, giving up only three hits in six innings. Therefore, as we keep that distant dream of catching back up in the AL East, Chen will do everything in his power to dim those dreams a little more by finally giving up a ton of runs in tonight's game.    Because the Red Sox are never allowed to lose again, Jon Lester will rebound from a disappointing season to throw something like a complete game shutout. A Royals win would put the Orioles 5.5 games back in the AL East. A Red Sox win would put them 6.5 games back, sitting in third place in the division. The Orioles have played 114 games. After 114 games last season, they were in third place in the division race, 6.5 games back. Symmetry can be cool, but that won't be making me root for Boston tonight or any other night.    Also, a bunch of football teams will be playing games that don't matter tonight and large numbers of people who get money to act like they matter will be trying to act like they matter.

However as we move through the 2013 pennant race the fact is that the Baltimore Orioles do control their own destiny\xe2\x80\xa6by virtue of the number of times that they\xe2\x80\x99ll see both Boston, Tampa, and even Cleveland down the stretch, as well as the fact that they own a tie-breaker with Texas. However the O\xe2\x80\x99s won twice this week against San Diego, yet they picked up only a half game on both Boston and Tampa. Part of this is certainly due to the fact that the O\xe2\x80\x99s were off both on Monday and on Thursday\xe2\x80\xa6but you also have to look for just a bit of a break.Boston and Tampa both refuse to lose in a sense. Now Boston did drop a game on Monday night in Houston as well as last night in Kansas City, and Tampa lost on Wednesday in Arizona. However both of these teams are fighting neck-and-neck with the Orioles; the difference right now is that they\xe2\x80\x99re ahead of the Birds in the standings. Granted the O\xe2\x80\x99s losing two-of-three to Boston and then Seattle at home didn\xe2\x80\x99t help matters, however I would submit that the frustrating thing from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 perspective is that teams (such as Toronto) who play the Birds tough seem to roll over for other teams. Let me state unequivocally for the record that I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel this is some sort of conspiracy to keep the O\xe2\x80\x99s or anyone else out of the playoffs. However it most certainly has to frustrate the team and the fans to a certain point.This probably comes across as sounding like the Orioles have some sort of entitlement to be in the playoffs; that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case. You have to earn your way to the postseason, and thus far Boston and Tampa have done just that. However what the Orioles need is for a team like Kansas City to step up this weekend and inflict the same kind of damage on Boston that they did to the O\xe2\x80\x99s a few weeks back (they got a good start last night). Tampa heads out to LA for an interleague series against the Dodgers this weekend, and of course LA\xe2\x80\x99s been about as hot as a team can possibly be of late.

Perhaps LJ Hoes and his new teammates can attempt to help out his old friends\xe2\x80\xa6you get the idea.However none of that matters if the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t go out and take care of business with the SF Giants this weekend. Granted the Giants are the defending champions, but their season\xe2\x80\x99s been derailed by injuries and the season has been a struggle for them.

08/10/2013,"[('Orioles 2, Giants 3: Clutch is the name of a band, not an ...', "" On a day when the O's primary playoff competition, the A's and the Rays, both lose it's rather imperative for the O's to take advantage of such a rare opportunity and gain some ground by taking care of their own business. Playing a skidding Giants team would seem like a perfect set-up for the O's to do just so. And yet... They did what they have seemingly done every time such opportunity has been afforded them previously: they lost. Was it due to the mystical dark arts of a soft-tossing lefty? Nope. Was it due to the day's starting pitcher inexplicably bringing a metaphorical gallon of gas and a pack of matches out to the mound with him? Nope. Today the culprit was the offense taking an afternoon siesta. Wei-Yin Chen cruised through the first 5 innings, allowing but one solitary baserunner. But as the Giants began their 3rd trip through the order in the 6th they managed to solve the riddle that Chen was dealing. After a lead off single by Andres Torres, Bruce Bochy dared defy the old adage of 'if you only play for one run that's all you'll get' by having Gregor Blanco sacrifice Torres over to 2nd. And it looked as if the adage might prove accurate as Marco Scutaro drove in Torres with a single to left-center to tie the game at 1 apiece before Joaquin Arias lined out. So with two down and a man on first it looked like Chen might slip the noose and get out of the inning with a quite low pitch count, setting himself up to be able to go 7 or possibly more innings. But Brandon Belt would have none of it as he drove the first pitch of the at-bat to deep center where it bounced over the wall for a ground rule Double. This brought could-have-been-an-Oriole Buster Posey (Seriously! Why would the O's have ever dreamt of drafting him rather than Brian Matusz? They already had Matt Wieters!) to the dish with runners at 2nd and 3rd. With 1st base open an Intentional Walk to one of the best hitters in all of baseball seems a prudent course of action. And so this is what Buck ordered, preferring to have Chen face Hunter Pence, who was 0-2 so far on the day. Well, when the bases are juiced it behooves a pitcher to not fall behind in the count. Chen fell behind in the count, 2-1. Pence proceeds to slap the next pitch down the right field line, where it lands just fair for a 2 run Double. 3-1 Giants now. A deficit for the Birds, certainly. But nothing even remotely daunting for an offense which has scored the 4th most runs in all of MLB. Right? Right? Oh... The script for this game was written in the 2nd inning. After an Adam Jones swinging strike out to lead off the inning, the O's managed to load the bases via a Single and 2 walks. This brought Taylor Teagarden to the plate. Tea has had his share of rather clutch hits during his tenure with the Birds. But today was one for the low-light reel, not the highlight reel as he K'd feebly on a down and away breaking ball. This left Chen to try and do his own dirty work. Chen had a grand total of 4 plate appearances in his MLB career prior to today. He was and unsurprising 0-3, with 1 Sac Bunt. For some further perspective, in 2011 with Chunichi in the NPL, Chen stepped up to the plate 48 times. He went 1-44, with 3 Sac Bunts and 1 Walk. After somehow getting ahead 3-0 in the count he took two strike calls before grounding back to the pitcher to end the O's scoring threat. Gah. Oh, but wait! There's more!    Remember the aforementioned 6th inning? Well, the O's had their own threat going in the top half of the inning. They had managed to dig into the bullpen after chasing starter Chad Gaudin who managed to hold the O's to just 1 run through 5 innings. Adam Jones lead off the 6th with a Single, and was followed by a Single from Nick Markakis. 1st and 2nd, none out! Let's get some runs, lads! Or not. A JJ Hardy flyout was followed by a Ryan Flaherty flarhtout which was in turn followed by another Taylor Teagarden strikeout. Tea was good for a -.132 WPA on the day. Amazingly that was only the 2nd worst WPA on day amongst the hitters: Manny Machado ought pay a fine in Kangaroo Court for his -.172 performance. oof. The highlight of the day for the O's was a mammoth Home Run by Chris Davis to lead off the 8th, his Major League leading 42nd of the season. Thor took a hack mighty enough to fell a sequoia with one blow. Somewhat shockingly, the ball did not vaporize upon contact with\xc2\xa0Mj\xc3\xb6lnir. But instead returned to Earth orbit and crash landed somewhere near the base of Half Dome in Yosemite National Park. This cut the Giants lead to 3-2. And when the O's followed this by getting runners to 1st and 2nd with one out, it seemed the O's would certainly tie the game, at a minimum. Nope. Back-to-back strikeouts by Ryan Flaherty and Matt Wieters (each at-bat would see the hitter get to a 2-1 count before letting the pitcher regain control) ended the inning not with a bang, but with a whimper. C'est la vie. Onto the rubber match of the series, tomorrow at 4:05 Eastern.   "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

While managing the Texas Rangers in 2005, Showalter persuaded a flailing pitcher, R. A. Dickey, to take up the knuckleball. Last year, Dickey won 20 games for the Mets and earned the National League\xe2\x80\x99s Cy Young Award.Dan Duquette, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 executive vice president for baseball operations, also has experience with a successful knuckleballer. When he ran the Red Sox, Duquette signed Tim Wakefield after the Pittsburgh Pirates released him in 1995. Wakefield pitched for 17 seasons with Boston.The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 strategy is a lifeline to pitchers trying to salvage their careers, and a low-risk, high-reward proposition for the organization.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest and say I did not see it coming in the first half of the game. In fact, I ended up not seeing it at all. Matt Cain looked to be in total control, even when he gave up the one run in the top of the 6thinning. Call me a fair weather fan, but I turned it off at that point, thinking it was hopeless. Actually, the issue for me was indeed weather related \xe2\x80\xa6 so call me a wet summer weather grass-cutting fan. I have a huge property and it had to be done or else call a local farmer to make hay. But I did check in from time to time on my iPhone while driving the tractor (probably illegal in the Peoples\xe2\x80\x99 Republic of Maryland), and I was pleased to see more runs being scored every time I checked.Aug 11, 2013; San Francisco, CA, USA; Baltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones (10) after a three-run home run during the ninth inning against the San Francisco Giants at ATIt is always said that wins in April count the same as wins in August or September \xe2\x80\xa6 well, yes, but in any event, yesterday was a great win. The Orioles need to not just keep pace, they need to win consistently and gain ground. The ballpark there in San Francisco looked to be giving up few runs, and to have a breakout offensive day as yesterday may prove, at some future retrospective moment, to have been a critical event in the history of this 2013 season. In particular, the J.J. Hardy homer \xe2\x80\x93 at the moment of the game in which it was hit \xe2\x80\x93 cannot be applauded enough as a clutch event. And may it be that the Orioles will learn to enjoy and feast upon the great and bounteous pleasure of \xe2\x80\x9ctack-on runs!\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 They really make a fan\xe2\x80\x99s life much easier (not to mention Jim Johnson \xe2\x80\xa6 which I probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have mentioned!).45 Games to GoSo, what do the Orioles need to do to get into the playoffs?\xc2\xa0 Again, thinking that they need, at a minimum, about the same number of wins as last year, the Birds will need to go 28-17 the rest of the way (to compile a 93-win season). That is doable, but to put it into perspective, that is a winning percentage of .622.\xc2\xa0 The best winning percentage in the game right now is held by the Braves at .610. There is not a lot of room for failure. The Orioles need clutch performances from all parts of the team.Feldman \xe2\x80\x93 Gotta Show UpA good place for a clutch performance would be one from Scott Feldman tonight. There are a lot of factors against that. The Orioles have a 3-9 career mark against the Diamondbacks. And Feldman himself has been rather short of \xe2\x80\x9clights out.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 His 5.70 ERA in six Orioles games has left fans wondering about the value of this trade. Actually, three of those six outings have been quality starts, but the other three games, including the last two, have been pretty painful. I have been entirely underwhelmed, but I certainly wish him well. He appears to be a perfect fit for this clubhouse, so I retain hopes for better outcomes \xe2\x80\x93 starting tonight.Banana-GateMuch is being made over an incident yesterday in San Francisco of a fan throwing a banana at Adam Jones. Jonesy has particularly picked up on this with his huge twitter following. If it has any racial overtones to it, that is certainly despicable. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lean toward the benefit of doubt and presume it was an idiot throwing the first thing at hand at the guy who buried his team with a three-run homer in the top of the inning. Although I\xe2\x80\x99ll grant the skeptical question that could be raised, \xe2\x80\x9cWho brings a banana to a baseball game?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Whatever, the bigger point should be that nothing should be allowed to be thrown onto the field, as the dangers are incalculable.Amazing DefenseMore should be, and will be, written about the unprecedented year the Orioles are having on the defensive side of the game. Who could have imagined this, even as recently as midway through last year? The additions of Manny Machado and Nate McLouth, and the change that it brought to this club, is among the more amazing things I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in my decades of watching baseball. It was a poignant moment this past week when, on the same day, Machado celebrated his first full year in the bigs, while Mark Reynolds was DFA-ed from the Indians.The defense was huge in the first half of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game. It prevented a larger lead from opening. Jones had a fabulous catch in centerfield that certainly minimized damage. And McClouth\xe2\x80\x99s sliding third-out catch immediately saved one run, and possibly more. Additionally, the double-play grounder begun by Machado on Pablo Sandoval was consummated before the portly dude was even half-way to first base.I have recently watched a number of other games of other teams that happen to be on, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been much struck at how poor the defense of most teams looks. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been spoiled by seeing the Orioles so regularly.

Youse\'s handed Delweld its first loss of the tournament, 12-5, in the first game to force a winner-take-all final in the double elimination tournament. The Orioles then clinched the title with a 13-3 victory. First baseman Ryan Ripken (Gilman), Cal Ripken\'s Jr.\'s son, was named the tournament\'s Most Valuable Player after batting .484 with 13 RBIs in seven games, leading Youse\'s to a 6-1 record.Varsity: Gary Gubbings has been named the new baseball coach at South River, replacing the retired Ken Dunn. Gubbings spent the past six years as an assistant coach under Dunn, who stepped down after 35 seasons. In the spring, Dunn earned Baltimore Sun All-Metro Coach of the Year honors after leading the Seahawks to a 20-5 season and the program\'s first state title. South River defeated Catonsville, 6-0, to capture the Class 4A state crown. var adSkipCounter = 0; Et ceteraRedskins\' Griffin expected to increase intensity of drills The practice activities of quarterback Robert Griffin III are expected to be intensified in the coming days at the Washington Redskins\' training camp, according to two people with knowledge of the team\'s planning. One person familiar with the situation said it is expected that Griffin\'s first drills against an 11-man defense will take place on Tuesday. It wasn\'t clear how significant his workload would be, however. Another person with knowledge of the Redskins\' broad planning for Griffin said that Griffin, barring a setback, is likely to take part in some full-team drills ""soon"" but did not say precisely when that is expected to happen. Both of those people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. It is not clear how firm the Redskins\' plans for Griffin\'s activities are. Coach Mike Shanahan has said he would stick to his training-camp plan for Griffin\'s practice workload unless Griffin suffers a setback. Shanahan has declined to say publicly when he will allow Griffin to participate in full-team drills at training camp. Griffin is expected to have at least one more day of scaled-back practice activities when the Redskins return to work today at their training camp facility in Richmond, Va. The reigning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, Griffin underwent surgery three days after the Redskins\' wild-card playoff loss to the Seattle Seahawks to have tears of the anterior cruciate and lateral collateral ligaments in his right knee repaired.\xe2\x80\x94The Washington PostWNBA: Crystal Langhorne (Maryland) scored 18 points to lead the host Washington Mystics (11-13) to a 74-63 win over the Connecticut Sun (6-15) at Verizon Center. Langhorne knocked down seven of 15 shots from the field and grabbed nine rebounds, including four offensive. Ivory Latta hit a trio of 3-pointers and Monique Currie scored 12 points for the Mystics, who won their second straight game on the heels of a four-game losing streak. Tina Charles had a double double with 18 points and 12 rebounds while Kelsey Griffin scored 17 points for the Sun, which lost their third straight game.

Surhoff, and all four are alumni of North Baltimore Aquatic Center.Horse racing: As he continues to train toward the Grade I $1 million Travers Stakes on Aug. 24, Kentucky Derby winner Orb arrived at Hall of Fame trainer Shug McGaughey\'s barn at Saratoga (N.Y.) Race Course midafternoon Sunday after a 51/2-hour van ride from the Fair Hill Training Center in Elkton. Showing good energy, the Malibu Moon colt was led out by groom Crisanto Maldonado and walked the shedrow before being led to his stall and then out to graze. ""He\'s a good shipper. I liked the way he came off the van,"" said McGaughey, who was joined at the barn by Ogden ""Dinny"" Phipps, who co-owns Orb with Baltimore County resident Stuart Janney III. ""I think he\'s gotten bigger."" McGaughey stood close by as Maldonado grazed Orb outside the barn. Orb had been at Fair Hill since the day after running third in the Grade I Belmont Stakes on June 8 at Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y. He had six works there, including a five-furlong breeze in 59.70 seconds on Saturday. ""They had to bring him in yesterday [from grazing after the work], he was feeling so good,"" McGaughey said.

Next season, very likely, there will be another possibility: a challenge by the manager.Major League Baseball announced on Thursday that it planned to greatly expand instant replay, starting in 2014, with managers having the option to challenge calls they believe the umpire missed. An umpiring crew watching video at Major League Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters in New York would have the final say on such plays, taking the burden off the umpires on the field.\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a historic moment for baseball,\xe2\x80\x9d John Schuerholz, the president of the Atlanta Braves, told reporters at a meeting of team owners in Cooperstown, N.Y. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have moved forward with a plan that will give our managers an opportunity to help control the calls that are made that impact their team.\xe2\x80\x9dNot all calls would be eligible to be challenged. The field umpires, for instance, would still have the final call on balls and strikes, hit batters and checked swings. But if baseball\xe2\x80\x99s proposal passes a formal owners\xe2\x80\x99 vote in November \xe2\x80\x94 and receives approval from the umpires and the players union, which have long been in favor of such advancements \xe2\x80\x94 fewer games should be decided by missed calls. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Home run calls by umpires have been reviewable since 2008, but even with the addition of that wrinkle, baseball, until now, remained a sport in which mistakes by umpires were generally accepted as a regrettable, but human, part of the game. In 2010, the umpire Jim Joyce cost the Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga a perfect game by blowing a call at first base on what would have been the final out. Galarraga smiled after the play, and the two men eventually wrote a book together.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Under the new system, that call could be challenged and overturned. The spontaneity of the moment \xe2\x80\x94 right or wrong \xe2\x80\x94 would be lost in favor of a more basic goal: that the final call is the correct one. \xe2\x80\x9cWe really tried to honor the legacy of the game and mostly recognize that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got technology that\xe2\x80\x99s improving quickly, and we had a good experience with the home run and boundary replays,\xe2\x80\x9d the former manager Tony La Russa, an adviser to Major League Baseball, said in a telephone interview on Thursday.La Russa added, \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes the competition more like it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be, that the team that plays best and executes best has the best chance to win.\xe2\x80\x9d Photo       Jim Joyce cost Armando Galarraga a perfect game by blowing a call at first in 2010.  Credit             Paul Sancya/Associated Press           Schuerholz and La Russa developed the new proposal with Joe Torre, a former player and manager who is now an executive vice president with Major League Baseball. For years, baseball had been content to let the other major sports put in more extensive replay, choosing instead to essentially preserve the status quo and not risk adding to the already troublesome length of games.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Jim Duquette, a former general manager of the Mets and the Baltimore Orioles, said that when substantial replay was proposed at a league meeting 15 years ago, more than three-quarters of the teams opposed it. In 2004, Duquette said, he tried to get the idea on the agenda of a baseball rules committee, which refused to discuss it.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no feeling we needed to change,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duquette, now a host on MLB Network Radio. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get replay with John Schuerholz, Tony La Russa and Joe Torre on the committee, we were never going to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get better credibility than those three have.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Managers would get one replay challenge in the first six innings of a game and two from the seventh inning on. (An unused challenge from the first six innings would not carry over to the later innings.) If a manager correctly challenged a call \xe2\x80\x94 that is, if the umpires watching on video in New York overturned the umpires on the field \xe2\x80\x94 he would retain that challenge to use again.In the National Football League, officials watch video replays themselves, on the sidelines, and then uphold or reverse the challenged call. In the National Basketball Association, referees study television monitors alongside the court and then issue their verdict. However, the National Hockey League, for the last decade, has relied on officials in a Toronto headquarters to issue rulings on disputed goals rather than rely on referees at the game.Baseball, under its expanded replay plan, would essentially be mimicking the N.H.L.\'s format.Still, the existing procedure for home run replays \xe2\x80\x94 the umpires leave the field, watch a video review and make their own determination \xe2\x80\x94 would stay the same, Schuerholz said. After the newly reviewable calls, the manager could leave the dugout to inform the plate umpire of his challenge, presumably before the next pitch was thrown. The umpires would then use a secure phone line in a nearby area and call the umpires at the headquarters, where a technician would cue up the play in question.

But he added that managers would no longer be allowed to argue reviewable calls, which he said made up 89 percent of all incorrect calls. Baseball does not want team officials reviewing their own video to determine if a challenge should be made, although policing that would not seem to be an easy thing to do.

They were in fifth place in the American League East, 27 games out of first place. That game, an 8-4 loss in Oakland, represented the only game that season where Brian Matusz passed what I have come to call the Brian Matusz Test: where a starting pitcher with a bad ERA ends the game with a lower ERA than he started. He gave up six earned runs in 6.2 innings to lower his ERA from 8.77 to 8.63. He made twelve starts in 2011 and this was the only one where his ERA went down. The game's leadoff batter was Nolan Reimold, who went 0-4 and had a .699 OPS at game's end. The ninth-place batter was Josh Bell, playing third base, who ended the game with a .420 OPS. Robert Andino was the second baseman. Mark Reynolds was the first baseman. Vladimir Guerrero was the $7.5 million designated hitter. Matt Wieters had a .707 OPS. OK, not everything is better. Wieters sits at a .704 OPS after Wednesday's game. The Orioles starting rotation in 2011 was even worse than this year's starting rotation has been. They ended the season with a 5.39 ERA in the rotation and a 4.92 ERA overall. Kevin Gregg was in the bullpen. Tommy Hunter was still a starter. Matusz, Jake Arrieta, Zach Britton, and Chris Tillman all started double-digit numbers of games and were generally mediocre-to-terrible.    Wednesday evening's loss to the Diamondbacks dropped the 2013 Orioles to a 65-55 record. They are in third place in the AL East, six games back of the division leader. They are three games out of the second wild card position. Bad as it has been to watch three straight walk-off losses, and as bad as it has been to see Jim Johnson blow three consecutive saves two separate times this season, Orioles fans have endured worst in the not-too-distant past. Before last season came along, we would have been thrilled to see our favorite team sitting where they are right now.    There are 42 games still to be played. The Orioles would need to go 28-14 to equal last year's record, which may not even be good enough to qualify for the playoffs. Such a run was possible for last year's team, but can it be done this year? As the nine losses in games when leading after eight innings shows, this team is not last year's team. There is no Manny Machado in the minors waiting to make an impact. There is no Nate McLouth playing his way into an open spot. There's only a starting rotation where even the most winning pitcher is a giant question mark and a bullpen that has regressed almost exactly how the doubters of the 2012 O's said that it would.    Still, a run is not out of the question. It only takes getting hot at the right time to propel them into the postseason, as their Camden Yards neighbors can attest. Do you think if they fired the hitting coach and replaced him that they could have a good last month and postseason? Maybe a member of the Harbaugh family is available for a consultation. There are higher expectations for the team now, which is not a bad thing. Perhaps the worst thing about all the years of losing was having to take solace in whatever small victories came along. As the clock struck midnight on the east coast around when the last out was recorded in that 120th game two years ago, we might have thought that at least it was nice that Robert Andino got two hits. Maybe he'd start getting hot. He would have multi-hit games in each of the next two games (also losses for the O's) and would go on to hit in ten straight games. Second baseman of the future! These are the things that matter when winning and losing have ceased mattering. They are the things that matter when losing might even matter more than winning, because if the team's going to suck, it might as well get as high of a draft pick as possible, so that it can draft Stephen Strasburg instead of Matt Hobgood. There are stakes now, something to lose, which means that fans must be prepared to be disappointed. Still, they are ten games over .500, and even with their problems, they should hold on a comfortable level above .500. There are many baseball fans out there who have it far worse than that, as we had it far worse ourselves just two years ago. The team leader in OPS at year's end was Reynolds with an .806. He was also the RBI leader with 86. The ERA leader was Jeremy Guthrie with a 4.33. We were heartbroken when an 8th-inning reliever (Koji Uehara) was traded. He did have sweet sideburns, true. Chris Davis having 77 home runs and counting over the past two seasons is a touch sweeter. The time may very well have arrived to press the panic button on this year's Orioles. Even having something to panic about is better than it used to be. There was no point panicking about the Orioles two years ago because they were just bad. There was nothing surprising or disappointing about that. They were yet another bad Orioles team. The draft was one of the highlights of the year. The best game of the year was winning their 69th game on the last day of the season. Great as it was to witness the birth of the Curse of the Andino, actual playoff games at Camden Yards were so much better. The 2013 O's may come up just a bit short, or more than a bit. They may even make the playoffs yet again. Whatever ends up happening, there is always the old baseball cliche: There's always next year. Here in Birdland, a better next year is no longer the dream of a fool.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Jim Johnson, Buck Showalter, and the idiocy of the \\u2026', ' There is a lot of discussion about the closer these days regarding how important such a position is (or isn\'t) and how silly it seems to be that a team anoints its best relief pitcher (usually) with a job that often places him in lower leverage innings than earlier, simply because it\'s the ninth inning. Yet despite any logical argument against it, every baseball team usually has a closer. Players go into spring training looking to win the closer job. Even managers like Joe Maddon, who are considered to be renegades of baseball tradition, still name a closer and still run him out in the ninth inning regardless of performance. Orioles fans have had the frustration of watching Jim Johnson struggle this season in a way we haven\'t seen from him in...well, ever. It\'s terrible and upsetting and, in my opinion, wholly avoidable. Suppose Jim Johnson were the same Jim Johnson he\'s been for the last six years but he\'d never been named closer. Same stuff, same domination, but instead he pitched in the sixth, seventh, eighth innings, whatever the situation dictated. If he began to struggle and it became clear he needed some time to work something out, pitch in a few low stress situations, and get himself back on track, then he could do that.    But simply because Johnson is the closer, the manager feels obligated to stick with him even when it\'s apparent to everyone in the stadium that it\'s a bad idea. And while I do wish that Buck Showalter would rise about the pressure, he\'s far from alone in this situation. If he does anything other than run Johnson out there over and over again then he\'s given him a demotion. I believe that Jim Johnson is a good pitcher who just needs to get straightened out, and that seems to be what Showalter thinks as well. But the position of closer has become like a prison. Closers make more money both in free agency and arbitration. Closer bring back more in trades. That\'s the way it is. But why? I know I\'m not bringing anything new to light here, this is mostly just venting. But there is a problem with the system and it puts both Johnson and Showalter in a really tough place. Even if Showalter were willing and able to give Johnson a break, the perception around baseball, in the media, and perhaps even in the Orioles clubhouse would be that he\'s lost faith, he\'s demoting Johnson not because nearly every reliever ever goes through bad stretches and needs a change, but because he\'s not a good pitcher.    Even as I write this I have the MLB Network on in the background and Mitch Wiliams (who I suppose feels the need to defend his former role) is lambasting the Blue Jays for not using their closer in a save situation. As the other people on the show point out that Casey Janssen has pitched in three of the last four days, Williams is saying ""I don\'t care! If you\'re a closer, you\'re a closer. You bring in your closer for that situation!"" Sigh. I can\'t begin to speculate what will happen if the Orioles take a three-run or less lead into the ninth inning on Friday against the Rockies. Will Showalter finally be forced to ""demote"" Jim Johnson? Or will he stick with his guy because that\'s what you do? Either way, I wish I lived in a baseball world where it was OK to give any pitcher a night off just because he needs it or to use whatever pitcher best fits the bill for each circumstance. Things would be a lot easier that way.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Are the Orioles that disliked? - birdswatcher.com', 'On a side note, I heard something interesting on the radio prior to Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s Baltimore Orioles game. I was flipping channel\xe2\x80\x99s, and I heard MASN analyst Phil Wood hosting a live call-in program during a rain delay at that evening\xe2\x80\x99s Washington Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 game. First off, let me preface this by saying that I respect Phil Wood, and he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the most knowledgeable baseball people in the Baltimore/Washington area. Anyone that\xe2\x80\x99s every listened to him on the radio or seen him on television knows that he has a deep love and respect for the game, it\xe2\x80\x99s storied past, etc. He\xe2\x80\x99s cut from the same cloth as Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Davis; both of them have been around a long time and are synonymous with local baseball.Courtesy of USA TodayOn this night it was fairly obvious that Wood was trying to fill time during a rain delay, and I\xe2\x80\x99m very sympathetic to that type of thing. You never really know when a storm is going to spring up, and it kind of catches everyone (including radio programmers) off guard. However when I turned on the game I heard Wood talking about how this season really shows the vitality of the Washington fan base in terms of the fans showing up to see a team that\xe2\x80\x99s struggled mightily all season long. Wood went on to say that it was almost the opposite effect in Baltimore, where the Orioles have only averaged in the 26K range for attendance this year.First off let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest; Washington\xe2\x80\x99s attendance (which Wood stated was averaging in the 33K range) is based squarely off of their playoff run last year. They claimed that their season ticket subscriptions sky rocketed last off season, so I would submit that many of those tickets were already sold. (It\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that some are walk up sales as well.) However I just found it interesting that Wood opted to call out the Orioles and the Oriole fan base. Anyone that lives in this region knows that there\xe2\x80\x99s tension between the two franchises, however\xe2\x80\xa6is it really worth bringing the Orioles into that discussion?I do believe that most people would agree that there are a lot of intangibles that go into attendance, weather being one of them. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the community is another; remember last year\xe2\x80\x99s series against the ChiSox in the heat of the pennant race that drew 10K fans per game? Many in the national media wanted to jump on the Baltimore fan base for that, however what everyone failed to mention was that the city was preparing for the Baltimore Gran Prix at the time. There were street closures and traffic snarl ups that never seemed to finish in the downtown area, forcing many people to opt not to attend the games.With that said, I just felt that it was unnecessary for the Orioles and indirectly the Orioles fans to be brought into a discussion into which they had no business being a part. Granted piling on the Orioles is something to which Nationals fans will probably always be ready to do, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that was the time or place. It\xe2\x80\x99s also worth saying that the per capita income in the DC region is more than it is in Baltimore. That makes a difference in the sense that people have more expendable income to spend on going to games. Not to mention lobbyists and corporations that own tickets at Nationals Park; Camden Yards crowds are generally blue collar.Ultimately I feel that the cities\xe2\x80\x99 attendance are mutually exclusive. MLB goes to great lengths to schedule home dates for both teams at different times so as to prop up both teams\xe2\x80\x99 attendances. I suppose that people are free to think what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to think about either side, but I just felt that it was in somewhat poor taste for Phil Wood to bring that up given that the only thing it stood to do was rile up another fan base that already seems to invent reasons to hate on the Orioles.

The Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 closer has made himself the topic of hot and heavy debate among the restless, which describes the majority of Orioles fans. The most extreme reactions involve releasing him, but even though that was Kevin Gregg\xe2\x80\x98s fate two years ago, things are not that dire yet.Johnson, who surrendered the tie run in the 9th inning of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s and Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s games before the Diamondbacks won in extra innings, has frustrated plenty of people but has yet to reach Kevin Gregg levels. Things aren\xe2\x80\x99t that dire yet, but objects in mirror are closer than they seem.Even if Buck Showalter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pull Johnson and let Francisco Rodriguez do the closing for a while, going closer by committee seems within reason at this point. Rodriguez, Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, and Tommy Hunter would be candidates, depending on the due batters in the 9th inning, on a case-by-case basis. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t your mind need a break if you were Johnson right now?He\xe2\x80\x99s not the only Oriole who needed today\xe2\x80\x99s day off. With certain exceptions, several hitters, including Adam Jones and Manny Machado, had unproductive at-bats and key situations. Was that partly because of good Arizona pitching? Yes. The other team always gets paid to get Oriole hitters out, too. But there were plenty of pitches Jones (who was red-hot on the first two legs of the trip); Machado (who hit a 2-run homer last night), and others, had no business swinging at.Jones apparently has not canceled his Twitter account just yet after using it to take a Giants fan to task for hurling a banana in his direction a few days ago. He tweeted today that the Arizona series was like root canal without novocaine.Your mind probably needs a break if you\xe2\x80\x99re a fan, too.

08/16/2013,"[('Orioles 3, Rockies 6: Wei-Yin Chen falls apart in seventh ...', "" The situation was easy to read. Wei-Yin Chen had pitched six strong innings, giving up only two runs, and had 98 pitches going into the seventh. This is the place where he falls apart. Have a reliever ready the first time a batter gets on base. This is not challenging. Indeed, Chen led off the seventh inning by issuing a walk to Michael Cuddyer. Time to pull him. There's no need to mess around. Instead, Chen pitched to the right-handed Wilin Rosario, who hit a home run just above the out-of-town scoreboard. The Orioles fell into a 4-2 hole that would ultimately turn into a 6-3 loss. What is the point of leaving Chen in there for the seventh? This is not the first time that Buck Showalter has been burned by a starter - particularly Chen - suddenly losing it. It will probably not be the last time. Given how the Orioles bullpen performed in Arizona, it's not hard to see why Buck would want to rely on his starter. That faith was not rewarded tonight. Chen pitched 6.1 innings, giving up five hits, a walk, and four runs, all earned, while striking out seven batters. If you take out the seventh his line would look like this: 6 IP, 4 H, 2 ER, 0 BB, 7 K, 1 HR. The home run he allowed was to a hitter who came into the game with a .219 on-base percentage (Charlie Culberson) who hit the first home run of his career.    Given how the bullpen performed tonight, surrendering two runs in 2.2 innings, perhaps there is even more reason for Buck to have rolled the dice with his starter. Francisco Rodriguez surrendered a monster bomb to Charlie Blackmon, a defensive replacement in left field. Blackmon's home run was his third of the season, and it landed on an umbrella out on Eutaw Street, the 73rd home run to land there in Camden Yards history. That also marked the 44th hit by an opponent, the sixth by an opponent this year, and the first by a Rockies player.    What was up with Charlies homering tonight, anyway? Blackmon replaced Culberson and they both ended up homering out of the #9 spot in the lineup. The Orioles specialize in walks and home runs given up to 8th- and 9th-place hitters, it seems. Rodriguez left the game with a right groin strain. He appeared to be limping as he warmed up for the eighth inning and may have been trying to pitch through the pain, which may explain the home run, but it still sucked. He was replaced by Darren O'Day, who only threw six strikes in fourteen pitches but made it through the rest of the inning unscathed.    Prior to the game, Jim Johnson guaranteed that the Orioles would win. He came on to pitch the ninth inning, though he was not going for the save on account of the O's having mustered only two runs against Juan Nicasio. There was no pressure and no stakes at all. The Orioles bats were flat and they were on the way to a loss. Not even then can Johnson get a clean inning. He left a pitch up that Todd Helton hit for a home run, the 2,491st of his career. That places him in 97th all-time on the hits list. Both of these bullpen-surrendered home runs were not necessary for Colorado to win the game. Matt Wieters hit the platonic example of an FUHR in the ninth - his 17th homer of the year - to make it a 6-3 score, and that was that. Why did the Orioles have only two runs off of Nicasio? That is an excellent question, especially when you consider that Nicasio, who entered tonight's game with a 5.04 ERA in 114.1 innings - with a 6.03 ERA in 59.2 road innings - had no business turning in a good start. It was only the sixth time in 22 starts that he went six innings. The Orioles did not get any hits from the time there was one out in the third inning until Wieters hit his home run with one out in the ninth. The 5-9 hitters were a total of 1-17 on the night, with Wieters' home run and a walk by Wieters and Brian Roberts being the only output from those spots in the order. Chris Davis had two walks but was 0-2, snapping an eight-game hitting streak, and J.J. Hardy took an 0-4, snapping an 11-game hitting streak. They were not without their chances in the game. Nate McLouth led off the game with a home run, the second time he's done so this season and the 12th time he has done so in his career. Manny Machado singled, but Davis, Adam Jones, and Markakis were retired in order without any more runs coming across. They got another chance in the third inning with the Roberts walk leading off the inning. Machado poked a single into right field. The bases were loaded when Nicasio walked Davis for the first time. Jones drove in a run with a seeing-eye single nearly identical to Machado's, leaving the bases still loaded with only one out. Markakis, who is slugging .369 (73rd out of 83 qualifying American League batters), only needed to get a ball into the outfield to score another run. He popped up pathetically, a foulout that barely left the dirt behind the batter's box that the catcher caught easily. Wieters smacked a hard liner right at Rockies second baseman D.J. LeMahieu and the inning was over. That was the last hit until the Wieters home run. The loss was the fourth straight at a time when the O's need to be kicking in the afterburners. They've engaged the turbo boosters, alright, but they are headed in the wrong direction as they play their way through the National League West. They will attempt to stop the slide on Saturday night at 7:05. Chad Bettis is starting for Colorado. The 24-year old will be making his 4th-ever MLB start and sports a 5.06 ERA.

That is what the Orioles have been unable to overcome all year. That hump is the 10-12 wins above .500 hump. They need to get to the 20+ wins over .500 level to move past September. I am beginning to think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be writing in October that the Orioles are a better than average team that is short of playoffs caliber, and perhaps a year away from a serious run \xe2\x80\xa6 thus making 2012 a true anomaly.Aug. 13, 2013; Phoenix, AZ, USA: Baltimore Orioles pitcher Miguel Gonzalez reacts after giving up a home run to Arizona Diamondbacks batter Gerardo Parra in the eighth inning at Chase Field. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY SportsYou choked, right?So, pitching coach Rick Adair has been announced to be on a personal leave. Around the message boards on various Orioles sites, questions have been raised about the curious timing of this \xe2\x80\x93 at a time when the pitching staff, particularly the bullpen, is imploding. Along with similar curiosities about Pedro Strop and Jason Hammel going on the DL conveniently \xe2\x80\xa6 well, it all is fodder for conspiratorial thinkers. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t honestly think that happened, but, it reminded me of a story in my life years ago (this is some of the rambling I promised at the top \xe2\x80\xa6 hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m an old man, OK?). I was in grad school in Texas and had lousy health insurance provided at a discount rate by the school for students \xe2\x80\x93 most of us rather poor. I had a trip to the ER from an allergic reaction to shellfish, and was submitting the claim to the agent \xe2\x80\x93 presuming there was no way it would be covered. The old fellow with a stereotypical long Texas drawl listened to my story and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSo, you choked, right?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I said that, no, not exactly, that there was some constriction I supposed \xe2\x80\xa6 to which he said, \xe2\x80\x9cLook son, I\xe2\x80\x99m jes tryin\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99help ya \xe2\x80\xa6 You choked, RIGHT??\xe2\x80\x9dNo, really, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy!Not about the string of losses! But I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased for Scott McGregor. He is truly a good guy \xe2\x80\x93 not just as an Orioles legend \xe2\x80\x93 but truly in the game of life. I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually met him a number of times, and he is an extremely likeable person. He has been to my church for several events (I\xe2\x80\x99m a pastor for those who did not know), as he is a person of faith with a good heart for outreach. And beyond that, he knows pitching and how to work with young players.Gotta love that name!I see where the Rockies have a pitcher named Josh Outman. That is an excellent name for a pitcher, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure hundreds of writers whom I\xe2\x80\x99ve never read have made the same association. He\xe2\x80\x99s a 28-year-old who came up with Oakland and has a career ERA of 4.56.\xc2\xa0 He had a clean 1-2-3 inning tonight (Friday).\xc2\xa0 Imagine a position player named Josh Hitman! \xc2\xa0That is certainly better than a pitcher named Hitman or a position player named Outman!\xc2\xa0 It reminds me of an orthodontist friend I have named Ron Toothman \xe2\x80\xa6 no kidding \xe2\x80\x93 I did not make that up!It\xe2\x80\x99s just a game, right?There are more important things in life than baseball, although I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting here right now trying to think what they would be!

08/17/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles minor league recaps: Parker Bridwell ...', "" Norfolk Tides 5, Toledo Mud Hens 4 The Tides staved off a ninth-inning rally against the Mud Hens to take the game 5-4. Freddy Garcia made the start for the Tides and pitched 7 innings with 6 H, 2 R, 2 BB, and 4 K. Adam Russell pitched a scoreless eighth and Jairo Ascencio gave up two runs in the ninth on a single and a home run. The Tides roster is littered with the names of guys who we've see with the Orioles this year, and those guys helped the Tides score three in the first. Chris Dickerson tripled and was bunted in to score by Yamaico Navarro. Later in the inning, Danny Valencia homered with Jason Pridie on base. All that was done against the Mud Hens starter, who is another familiar name: Jair Jurrjens. The Tides scored solo runs in the second and seventh as well. The Tides had eight hits on the night with Pridie leading the way with three of them, plus one walk. Dickerson and Zelous Wheeler each had two hits, and Valencia had one (the homer). The rest of the lineup went hitless. Bowie Baysox 5, Richmond Flying Squirrels 4 (11) The Baysox played part of two games tonight and lost both of them. The first was the completion of a game that was suspended back on July 21st. They picked up the game in the bottom of the 10th inning with the score tied 5-5. The game had begun in Richmond and so the Squirrels were the home team even though they were in Bowie last night. Matt Bischoff pitched a scoreless 10th before allowing the Squirrels to walk off in the 11th thanks to three singles.     The Baysox sent five men to the plate in their only at-bat. Kyle Hudson and Trayvon Robinson walked. The other three were retired.    Bowie Baysox 0, Richmond Flying Squirrels 3 In their regularly scheduled contest, the Baysox were shut out despite getting nine hits on the night. They just couldn't do much against the Squirrels' starter Edwin Escobar who gave up seven hits with one walk and five strikeouts. Trayvon Robinson, Buck Britton, Josh Horton, and Luis Martinez each had two hits on the night. Other than one double by Martinez, they were all singles. Tyler Wilson started for the Baysox with a line of 5 IP, 7 H, 2 R, 1 BB, 4 K. Clayton Schrader followed with three innings and gave up the final run. Marcel Prado pitched a scoreless ninth.    Frederick Keys 3, Potomac Nationals 7 Zach Clark's knuckleball was out of control last night as he walked four batters in five innings on the way to a Keys loss. Clark gave up five runs in his outing and was followed by Matt Hobgood, who wasn't much better. Hobgood allowed two runs on four hits in his three innings pitched. The Keys had fourteen hits but just three runs. They scored single runs in each of the second, third, and fourth innings. Dariel Alvarez continues to impress as he had three hits in just his second game in Frederick. Mike Ohlman, Travis Adair, and Tucker Nathans each had two hits on the night. Delmarva Shorebirds 2, Lakewood Blue Claws 0 What a night for Parker Bridwell! The young starting pitcher threw eight shutout innings last night with just two hits (both singles) and fourteen strikeouts. Wow! Mychal Givens pitched a perfect ninth for the save with two strikeouts of his own. Only one player on the opposing team didn't have at least one strikeout on the night. The Shorebirds only scored two runs on seven hits, but that was plenty thanks to the great pitching. Gregory Lorenzo and Joel Hutter each had two hits with both of Lorenzo's being doubles. Anthony Caronia, Lucas Herbst, and Nik Balog also had hits for the Birds. Aberdeen Ironbirds 10, Connecticut Tigers 2 The Ironbirds great season continues as they slugged their way to another win last night. They racked up seventeen hits on the night with multi-hit games from Sam Kimmel, Trey Mancini, Connor Bierfeldt, Hector Veloz, Jared Breen, and Manny Hernandez. Federico Castagnini (great name) only had one hit, but it was a home run. The only starter to go hitless was center fielder Mike Yastrzemski, who was 0-for-5 with three strikeouts. Mike Horacek made the start for the Birds and struck out eight over six innings. He only gave up three hits and he walked three. Nick Cunningham pitched a scoreless inning with one hit allowed and Augey Bill (another great name) pitched a perfect ninth with two strikeouts.

08/18/2013,"[(""Baltimore Orioles: Hey Rocco, I didn't hear no bell!"", 'Remember the recurring scene in the\xc2\xa0Rocky movies (almost as must-see as\xc2\xa0The Godfather trilogy for any Italian kid) where Rocky\xe2\x80\x99s old boxing instructor tells him\xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear no bell!\xc2\xa0That of course is a manner in which to say that things aren\xe2\x80\x99t over and done with, and that\xe2\x80\x99s very similar to the concept of the \xe2\x80\x9cFighting Showalters.\xe2\x80\x9d We know the story by now; play hard \xe2\x80\x99till the final out. However in this case it\xe2\x80\x99s not about playing until the final out, it\xe2\x80\x99s understanding that the season isn\xe2\x80\x99t over yet. While the Orioles had struggled in the past week \xe2\x80\x93 while the teams around them seemed to thrive \xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99re far from out of the pennant/wild card race\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and they proved that with last night\xe2\x80\x99s 8-4 victory over Colorado. Starter Bud Norris struggled at the beginning and end of his outing last night, but put his team in a position to win the game. Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 5.2 IP, 9 H, 4 R, 3 BB, 5 K. Norris gave up one ru n in the first after having multiple runners on base, but the Orioles tied it in the last of the inning on Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x98 sac fly. However the inning for which most of Birdland had been waiting (to prove that the O\xe2\x80\x99s hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard no bell) ended up being the last of the third. Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 infield single put runners at the corners with nobody out (and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to that later on), and Chris Davis scored on Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single to put the Birds ahead 2-1. Jones would score on a Troy Tulowitzki error, and Brian Roberts would later rip a double to the scoreboard in right (scoring Markakis and Steve Pearce). Roberts would also come into score on a Manny Machado two-RBI double, which also scored Nate McLouth from first base (who walked to get on).Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWhen the smoke cleared, the Orioles led 8-1, and had put up a seven-run inning next to their name. Uh yeah, if anyone in Birdland thought the bell had sounded to end things, I think they were mistaken! There was one key play in the aforementioned sequence that stuck out to me, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not reflected in the box score. With the score tied at one and Davis on third, Jones hit a hopper to Nolan Arenado at third. Arenado made a valiant effort to get to the ball, however on contact Chris Davis immediately moved back on the bag at third base. Arenado briefly bobbled the ball, and while he still made a great throw to first base that allowed Jones to reach safely. Did Davis in effect interfere with Arenado, thus causing him to lose concentration? Absolutely. However a base runner does have the right to the bag, and Davis\xe2\x80\x99 quick thinking made that inning possible. Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show up on the stat sheet, however it was as important a play as any other (if not more so).Colorado chipped away a bit down the stretch, and they eventually chased Norris in the sixth after an RBI-single. MASN cameras caught Norris throwing his glove down in the dugout after his departure, obviously not happy about only pitching into the sixth. Overall the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen performed very well, pitching 3.1 innings and not yielding a run. Josh Stinson, who was called up from \xe2\x80\x93 WAIT FOR IT \xe2\x80\x93 Norfolk, pitched an inning plus one out, and held the game in check for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. (If you\xe2\x80\x99re a fan of the TV show\xc2\xa0How I met your Mother, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get that reference; if not, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it!) Buck Showalter used Tommy Hunter in the ninth inning given the fact that it was a non-save situation, which means that Jim Johnson would in theory be rested for this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s series finale.The Birds had called Stinson up as the corresponding roster move for Henry Urrutia, who was optioned back to Norfolk (to get regular at-bats according to Showalter). So the O\xe2\x80\x99s shorted their bench in favor of some bullpen support at least for one game. Stinson is expected to be a short-term fixture out in the pen, as at some point (perhaps even before today\xe2\x80\x99s series finale) they\xe2\x80\x99ll need the extra bench player again. Go figure that on a day when the Orioles purposely short their bench, J.J. Hardy has to sit out due to back spasms. Hardy said before the game that he expects to be able to play this afternoon. The series will wrap up today with Scott Feldman pitching for the Birds. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by\xc2\xa0Jhoulys Chacin of Colorado.So fans who thought that the season was over because of a few August struggles were put on notice last night that they were mistaken. This was only one win out of 162 games, however when things aren\xe2\x80\x99t going well for you getting that one stop gap victory is very important. Now the O\xe2\x80\x99s need to continue this trend, especially with Tampa coming to town behind Colorado. With all of that said, forward to about 2:35 of this video clip\xc2\xa0so as\xc2\xa0NOT\xc2\xa0to hear the bell! ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles 7, Rockies 2: Chris Davis and Adam ... - Camden Chat', "" The ingredients were there for another frustrating Orioles loss: runs scored early and then none following the third inning, an opponent that threatened and eventually scored runs, a shaky bullpen having to pick up a couple of innings. The Orioles had many chances and left a ton of men on base, but they came through with insurance runs late in the game for once and cruised to a 7-2 victory to take the series against the Rockies. Against one of the best pitchers in baseball on the road this season in Jhoulys Chacin, the Orioles early offense was impressive. Chacin entered the game with a 1.87 ERA on the road, so scoring three runs in the 5.1 innings that Chacin pitched is nothing to be disappointed by. They tagged him for nine hits and also recorded two walks, but could only manage the three runs while he was in the game. For once, it was the bottom of the order that came through. Nick Markakis, continuing to bat fifth with his .367 slugging percentage, opened things up with a single with one out. Brian Roberts followed with another single and the Orioles had a promising scoring chance with two men on. The next two batters due up were Ryan Flaherty and Alexi Casilla. That doesn't seem so promising after all. Flaherty advanced the runners on a groundout, but what is the point of getting two men in scoring position for Casilla with two outs? Most of the time, there is no point. Today proved to be the exception. Casilla singled into right - same as did Markakis and Roberts - and scored the Orioles' first run. Taylor Teagarden was up next, so the inning was over. Too many hitters in the bottom of the lineup can't come through at one time. That would just be crazy.    It was the middle of the order that struck in the third inning, with Chris Davis getting a two-out rally going by hitting a double into the right field corner, his 35th double of the season. There he stood when Adam Jones swung at a low and away breaking ball. That sounds like a recipe for a strikeout, doesn't it? The thing is that this breaking ball wasn't low and away enough and instead it ended up landing in the Orioles bullpen, 414 feet away from home plate.    The home run was Jones' 25th of the season, making this the third straight season that the Orioles outfielder has hit 25 or more home runs. According to the Jumbotron during the game, the last Orioles outfielder to accomplish this was Frank Robinson. That was the whole of the rally. Markakis walked but was stuck on first when Roberts lined out to short. Davis and Jones were the stars of the game for the Orioles, with Davis going 4-5 and scoring three runs, hitting his 45th home run of the season to take away the save situation and keep Jim Johnson out of the game Jones went 3-5 with two runs scored and two runs batted in. The two Orioles sluggers were both a triple short of the cycle. Between the two of them, Davis and Jones have 204 RBI.    Meanwhile, Scott Feldman cruised, more or less, through six innings. Because he's an Orioles starter, he ran into a little difficulty in the sixth inning even though he entered that inning having thrown less than 70 pitches. Feldman walked Corey Dickerson with one out, and then threw two god-awful pitches that got away from Teagarden advanced Dickerson to second and then third base all within a single plate appearance. Both were scored as wild pitches, as they should have been. Feldman tightened up the ship and struck out Troy Tulowitzki in the same at-bat where he uncorked the two wild pitches. Michael Cuddyer flew out to center and the O's got through six with a 3-0 lead. It was the seventh inning where the Rockies would do their damage for the day. Todd Helton led off with a double off of Feldman and advanced to third on a sacrifice fly by Nolan Arenado. A brief homer-infused interjection on Arenado: defensive metrics such as UZR and DRS suggest that Arenado is in the same class as Manny Machado at third base this season. Arenado did absolutely nothing to live up to that in this series. I had never heard of Arenado before recording Thursday's podcast, because who cares about the National League? I don't doubt he's looked good the whole rest of the year, but nobody looks good when they're playing the hot corner in the same park as Machado. Charlie Blackmon drove in Helton with a double and easily stole third, which allowed him to score on a groundout by Yorvit Torrealba. Ninth-place hitter D.J. LeMahieu followed with a single. This chased Feldman from the game. Tommy Hunter shut down the situation. Feldman's line included 6.2 innings pitched with five hits, two walks, and two earned runs allowed. It was his fourth quality start for the Orioles in eight tries. The Orioles added insurance runs in both the seventh and eighth innings against the Colorado bullpen. Two runs scored off Josh Outman in the seventh thanks to a two-run single by Roberts, who was 2-3 with a walk on the day. Davis' home run came in the eighth off Edgmer Escalona, who has an excellent name, if not an excellent ERA. With the save chance taken out of reach by that home run, the Orioles summoned Josh Stinson to pitch the ninth inning. He gave up a hit and a walk, but no more runs crossed the plate and Johnson was not needed, thankfully. For his effort, Stinson was rewarded by being optioned back to Triple-A Norfolk following the game. Interleague is over for the O's. They finished with an 11-9 record against the inferior baseball league. They could have won so many more than they did. Now, it's going to be almost all American League East for the entire rest of the season, starting with the Tampa Bay Rays coming into town to kick off a three-game series on Monday night.

In the letter, the league offered to waive the confidentiality clause with respect to Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s entire history under the drug program, in effect challenging Tacopina to do the same. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Tacopina declined to sign the waiver offer, and he later issued a statement calling the letter a \xe2\x80\x9cpublicity stunt\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9ctrap.\xe2\x80\x9d He said such a waiver on his part would require the players union to be part of the agreement.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In response, Rob Manfred, an executive vice president with Major League Baseball and the person who wrote the letter to Tacopina, said in a statement that \xe2\x80\x9cthe players association has never stood in the way of an individual player publicly disclosing his own drug-testing history.\xe2\x80\x9d Manfred said baseball would be \xe2\x80\x9cmore than happy\xe2\x80\x9d to add a line to the waiver for the union to add a signature alongside Tacopina\xe2\x80\x99s.The letter that was delivered to \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x9d and later released by baseball was notably pointed in its language, saying the proposed waiver would allow Rodriguez and Major League Baseball to disclose information and documents that would extend beyond his suspected links to a South Florida anti-aging clinic. The now-closed clinic, Biogenesis, was at the center of an investigation that led to a 211-game suspension for Rodriguez, which he is now appealing.The letter said it would seek full disclosure of all drug tests conducted on Rodriguez under baseball\xe2\x80\x99s program; all documents and messages relating to Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s treatment by Anthony Bosch, who operated Biogenesis and is now cooperating with baseball\xe2\x80\x99s investigation; all documents related to the treatment that Rodriguez has acknowledged receiving from Anthony Galea, a Toronto-based doctor who pleaded guilty in 2011 to smuggling human growth hormone into the United States; and all treatment Rodriguez has received from Victor Conte, whose Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative was at the heart of a drug scandal involving a number of prominent athletes.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The letter also said it would seek disclosure of documents relating to baseball\xe2\x80\x99s contention that Rodriguez attempted to obstruct its Biogenesis investigation.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In connection with that issue, ESPN reported on Sunday that Rodriguez had paid Bosch\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer a $25,000 retainer in February to assist in Bosch\xe2\x80\x99s legal defense. A representative for Bosch\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, Susy Ribero-Ayala, confirmed the payment in a statement to ESPN. Ribero-Ayala did not return a message seeking comment Monday.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The ESPN report said Rodriguez tried to make a second payment to Bosch of $50,000, which the lawyer declined to accept.In an interview on CNN on Monday, Tacopina said there had been a \xe2\x80\x9cconsulting relationship\xe2\x80\x9d between Biogenesis and Rodriguez. In January, however, a Rodriguez representative denied that the player had been advised by Bosch.Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s associates remained on the attack, furnishing medical reports that addressed a point of contention between him and the Yankees. Rodriguez and his representatives said that the Yankees hid information from him about a tear in his left hip during last year\xe2\x80\x99s playoffs and allowed him to keep playing ineffectively in an apparent effort to discredit him.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In fact, a tear in his left hip was cited in a magnetic resonance imaging test that took place late on Oct. 10. According to a two-page report detailing the M.R.I.\xe2\x80\x99s findings, which was provided to The New York Times by Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s representatives, a \xe2\x80\x9csmall tear\xe2\x80\x9d in the left hip was detected by Dr. Marc Brown, a radiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, who did the M.R.I. on behalf of the Yankees.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Levitz said that because the reason for the M.R.I. was to look at Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s right hip, which had been surgically repaired in 2009, the information about the left hip may have initially flown under the radar.The M.R.I. had been ordered by Ahmad after Rodriguez complained about pain in his right hip when a pinch-hitter replaced him in Game 3 of a division series against the Baltimore Orioles on Oct. 10, a startling circumstance that underscored how ineffective Rodriguez had become at the plate.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But while the M.R.I. was for the right hip, in which no new tear was found, Brown noted a problem with the left. Shortly after the M.R.I., the Yankees eliminated Baltimore in the first round of the playoffs and faced Detroit in the American League Championship Series. After going 2 for 16 against the Orioles, Rodriguez went 1 for 9 against the Tigers.The Yankees were swept by Detroit, and not long afterward, Rodriguez traveled to Colorado to visit Dr. Marc Philippon, who had performed the 2009 operation. Philippon\xe2\x80\x99s findings, which were also provided to The Times, noted the tear in the left hip and recommended surgery, which was done in January.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees, in a statement Monday, said that Rodriguez never complained about a left hip problem and that they were never given a diagnosis about it.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe relied upon Dr. Christopher Ahmad and the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital for medical diagnosis, opinions and treatment,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Yankees neither had any complaints from Alex Rodriguez pertaining to his left hip during the 2012 regular season and the Yankees postseason, nor did the Yankees receive any diagnosis pertaining to his left hip during that same period of time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Neither NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital nor Ahmad could be reached for comment.

The first inning was pretty quiet, but for those of you who don\'t believe in jinxes, after Mike Bordick spent an eternity telling us all how good Evan Longoria is against Chris Tillman, and how careful Tillman needed to be against him, Longoria blasted one into the center field seats to spot the Rays a 1-0 lead. \xc2\xa0The Orioles went quietly in the bottom of the first, with Chris Davis drawing a walk, but Adam Jones -- stop me if you\'ve heard this one before -- striking out on a ball in the dirt, low and away. The Rays slapped away in the second, plating a run on a sequence of three singles by Yunel Escobar, Matt Joyce and Kelly Johnson and\xc2\xa0running Tillman\'s pitch count quickly up near 50 pitches. \xc2\xa0Fortunately, Tillman was able to limit the damage by getting Desmond Jennings to fly out weakly with men on first and third and two outs. \xc2\xa0The Orioles came right back in the second, though, with a one-out rally featuring singles from J.J. Hardy and Nick Markakis, followed by an RBI double by Danny Valencia. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, David Price collected himself and induced weak flyballs from Steve Pearce and Brian Roberts to end the threat. The Orioles scraped out another run in the bottom of the third, but it could easily have been three. \xc2\xa0After singles by Manny Machado and Jones, Matt Wieters drilled a ball to dead center that caromed between the top of the two pads at the absolute deepest part of center field, missing a home run by about six inches in any direction but down. \xc2\xa0After settling for an RBI double to tie the game, the Orioles had runners at second and third with just one out, but Price managed to strike out Hardy and pop out Markakis to stifle the threat of more runs.    Meanwhile, after he had settled down in the third, Tillman -- stop me if you\'ve heard this one before -- gave the lead right back, walking Escobar before serving up a two-run blast to right by Joyce. \xc2\xa0The Orioles, meanwhile, squandered their own chance in the fourth, after Valencia and Pearce led off with back-to-back singles. \xc2\xa0Roberts flied out, but at least moved Valencia over to third. \xc2\xa0Machado struck out swinging, leaving the inning in the hands of Chris Davis. \xc2\xa0Alas, after working a 2-0 count, then a full count a few pitches later, Davis also struck out on an inside heater.    Tillman continued his Jekkyl/Hyde act in the fifth, working through the inning quickly and uneventfully, but the Orioles offense continued its Hyde/Hyde act, threatening early against Price and blowing it again. \xc2\xa0Wieters and Hardy singled with one out, with Wieters alertly taking third on Hardy\'s single and allowing Hardy to advance to second on the throw. \xc2\xa0But Markakis flied out -- too weakly to score Wieters. \xc2\xa0Valencia walked to load the bases with two outs for Steve Pearce, who -- stop me if you\'ve heard this one before -- grounded to short to end the threat. Tillman actually stayed consistent through the sixth, and the Orioles\' constant ability to put on baserunners without plating them chased Price after just five innings, even though he only allowed two earned runs. \xc2\xa0That\'s right, ten hits, two walks, and two runs to show for it. \xc2\xa0However, the Orioles\' offense would fare no better against the soft middle of the Rays bullpen, with Machado working a one-out walk against Jamey Wright before Davis and Adam Jones both grounded out to the right side.    Meanwhile -- stop me if you\'ve heard this one before -- Tillman\'s pitch count drove him out of the game after six innings, leaving Troy Patton to work in the top of the seventh. \xc2\xa0Patton got outs from the two lefties he faced (Joyce and Johnson), sandwiched around a double to the lone righty he faced, Jose Molina. \xc2\xa0He was lifted in favor of Francisco Rodriguez, who walked Jennings, then uncorked a wild pitch to Ben Zobrist, advancing the runners to second and third, but he managed to strike Zobrist out to end the threat (apparently that can actually happen to both teams). The Orioles were left to face the tough part of the Rays bullpen, with Joel Peralta coming in for the seventh inning. \xc2\xa0Matt Wieters responded by planting a ball on the flag court, apparently upset with the park taking away his earlier shot, cutting the Orioles\' deficit to one run. \xc2\xa0Hardy and Markakis made quick outs (Markakis on a laser line drive that happened to go right to Myers, continuing his XBH drought), but apparently no one told Valencia that Peralta was right-handed, because he shot a single to center, and Pearce did the same to put runners at the corners with two outs, prompting Joe Maddon to go to Jake McGee to face Roberts. \xc2\xa0I can\'t even break out another ""stop me if you\'ve heard this one before,"" because Roberts has had some big RBIs lately, but he grounded out to short to end yet another scoring opportunity. K-Rod came back on to start the eighth, and things got dicey in a big hurry, with back-to-back-to-back singles loading the bases before an out was even recorded. \xc2\xa0After a seemingly endless at-bat by Yunel Escobar, the Orioles lucked into a liner to Chris Davis, which he snapped to second for a double play that would turn bases loaded, no outs, into runners at the corners with two down. \xc2\xa0Buck Showalter turned to Brian Matusz, who -- stop me if you\'ve heard this one before -- stranded the baserunners with a key groundout. The bottom of the eighth -- stop me if you\'ve heard this one before -- involved a runner in scoring position with less than two outs who didn\'t score. \xc2\xa0Chris Davis hit a one-out double (which actually went off the left fielder\'s glove), and was promptly stranded by back-to-back Ks from Jones and Wieters. \xc2\xa0If you care to count such things, the first eight innings had a combined 23 hits, five walks and just seven runs. The top of the ninth was drama-free, with a rare Machado error allowing Escobar to second base with two outs, but Tommy Hunter recorded the third out on his third groundball of the night. \xc2\xa0That left the Orioles with one last chance to score a run (or more) off of Fernando Rodney. Because this game was what this game was, Hardy led off the 9th with a single, and got replaced by pinch runner Alexi Casilla, who promptly got thrown out trying to steal second. \xc2\xa0Markakis drew a walk, but Rodney got Valencia to strike out swinging about 20 feet in front of a breaking ball, and Nate McLouth grounded out to first to strand yet another baserunner. Final damage for the Orioles: 15 hits, four walks, three runs. \xc2\xa0Never has this team so badly deserved a seemingly close loss. \xc2\xa0If you get nineteen baserunners in a nine-inning ballgame, and lose 4-3, there is no one to blame but yourselves, not even if your starter only had a so-so day. \xc2\xa0It\'s even worse for a team that seemed to be on the upswing after some tough times, and was coming back home to play a foe who factors into both their division and wild-card fates. \xc2\xa0The Orioles are backing themselves further into a corner with losses like this one.

Orioles GIFs of the Week   ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles analysis: OPS by position compared to the rest of ...', ' Three months ago, the Orioles second basemen and designated hitters were very bad. Night after night, they seemed to be completely awful. ""These must be some of the worst hitters in the American League,"" I thought, and looked to see if what I thought was true. It was. In June, this was still the case: the second basemen were the worst-hitting second base unit and the designated hitters were the worst-hitting DH unit. There was some slight improvement in July. It is one month and two days since the last edition of this article. What has happened in the last month? The time has come to revisit the positional rankings and see how the Orioles measure up with another 27 games played. In the July edition, the Orioles were in third place in the American League East, 4.5 games behind the division leader. With Boston falling on Sunday night, the Orioles are in third place in the division, 4.5 games back. They have lost no ground in the division, but they have not gained any either. They sit three games back in the wild card race. They will need to charge ahead in the last month and a half. As has been the case all season, if they don\'t make it, it\'s probably not the fault of the hitters. A season-long troubled rotation and a recently-shaky bullpen are the biggest culprits. That they are where they are is the offense carrying them a long way to get here. The chart below contains the hitting numbers for each position by the Orioles and includes their rank in the American League by OPS (on-base percentage plus slugging percentage). They are rankings by position, not by player, but most of the Orioles positions are nearly-entirely a single player. First base is Chris Davis. Shortstop is J.J. Hardy. Left field is mostly Nate McLouth, and so on.    Also included are the current batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage at each position, as well as for the whole team, with the change between this time last month and now reflecting how the numbers have heated up or cooled off. A month ago, the Orioles as a team ranked third in OPS, with five positions where they ranked fifth or better, two where they ranked second or first, and two where they ranked twelfth or worse.    The chart does not reflect any movement that may have occurred from Sunday\'s games.   Position AVG OBP SLG +/- OPS OPS Rank (AL)   DH .206 .265 .381 +.003 12   C .228 .287 .402 +.017 9   1B .291 .366 .638 -(.057) 1   2B .243 .299 .368 +.022 11   3B .297 .325 .452 -(.028) 7   SS .255 .298 .443 +.008 4   LF .274 .339 .415 +.002 5   CF .300 .326 .506 +.004 2   RF .286 .336 .375 -(.028) 11   Whole team .264 .314 .436 -(.012) 3      The good news is that the Orioles, for a second straight month, do not have the worst unit in the American League at any position. The bad news is that for another month, their options at designated hitter have proven to be poor. Most of the positions have leveled off. This is who they are. Jones, who can be a very frustrating player at the plate, is the second-best center fielder, by OPS, in the AL. Hardy is another player who can be frustrating with that sub-.300 on-base percentage, but Orioles shortstops (led by Hardy) have hit ten more home runs than any other team\'s shortstops. Three positions experienced significant declines. First base is fine even with Davis coming slightly closer to the level of mere mortals. He is one of the best players in the league, and so far above his peers at that position offensively this season that there is not even a close second. While we might feel better if Machado had continued his torrid start, he is still just 21, average at his position offensively, while being the best at his position defensively. There is a gap of .113 between seventh and eighth among third basemen, so Machado is clearly on the tier he is. Right field is worrisome, falling from fifth to eleventh in the span of a month. Nick Markakis has not had a hit for extra bases in a calendar month and he has just two since June 25. He brings average defensive value at best while having almost entirely eroded as a useful player on offense. The Orioles, collectively, remain as the third-best OPS in the league. They rank 10th in on-base percentage but remain first in slugging percentage - though their lead in slugging is the slimmest of margins over Boston and Detroit, with .002 points separating the three teams in slugging. The O\'s have 14 more home runs than any other team, and they rank third in doubles, but last in triples. They are averaging 4.79 runs scored per game. Last year, they averaged 4.4 runs per game. At this point, they are what they are. There are no significant reinforcements to be seen. Brian Roberts might boost second base a little bit as he returns to as much of his classic form as his 35-year old body will allow. Maybe Wilson Betemit will come back and take his turn as the designated hitter for a little while. Maybe he will outperform the likes of Danny Valencia and Henry Urrutia against right-handed pitchers. Maybe Matt Wieters will hit better towards the end of the season, as he has done most of the rest of his career. None of these are sure things. This is the team. These are the guys. Individually, some disappoint us, but as a group, they are great. If some or all of them can get hot over the last month and a half, that will help the push for the playoffs a lot, but it\'s going to have to be the pitching staff that gets them most of the rest of the way there.

Tampa Bay moved within a half-game of the first-place Red Sox in the AL East, pending Boston\'s late game in San Francisco.Price (7-5) was effective when it counted. He struck out six and allowed only two runs, as Baltimore went 2 for 11 with runners in scoring position and stranded 10 against the left-hander.""That\'s why he\'s one of the best pitchers in the game. He knows how to get out of jams like that,"" Orioles center fielder Adam Jones said. ""When he needs a strikeout, he knows how to get it.""Price seemed relieved to survive.""That\'s the most draining it has been in a while,"" he said. ""This (Baltimore) team is just, they\'re tough. That\'s why they\'re in the position they\'re in right now. ... We made some pitches when we needed to, had some hard hit balls at some guys. You\'ve got to have that good fortune sometimes.""Price has won four straight decisions since July 12.""You have to give David credit,"" manager Joe Maddon said. ""David did not have his best night, but nevertheless ... I really, really appreciated his effort.""So did Price\'s teammates.""David didn\'t have his best stuff tonight, and he did a great job battling, really giving us a chance to win,"" Joyce said.Fernando Rodney, the fourth Tampa Bay reliever, worked the ninth for his 28th save.Baltimore starter Chris Tillman (14-4) gave up four runs and five hits in six innings. It was his first loss in seven starts since July 6.Matt Wieters had three hits and a home run for the Orioles, who fell five games behind Boston. Baltimore outhit Tampa Bay 15-10 but stranded 15 and went 2 for 14 with runners in scoring position.""We got a good pitcher out of the game in the fifth inning and put a lot of good at-bats up against Price and just couldn\'t quite break it open,"" Wieters said.Tampa Bay went up 4-2 in the fourth when Joyce hit his 16th home run after Yunel Escobar drew a one-out walk. In the Baltimore half, Manny Machado and Chris Davis struck out with runners at the corners.Price worked out of trouble in the fifth, using his 99th and final pitch to retire Steve Pearce on a sharp grounder with two outs and the bases loaded.""You\'ve got to have those line drives at guys, you\'ve got to have guys making good plays in the field, and that\'s what we did tonight,"" Price said.Wieters homered off Joel Peralta leading off the seventh, but Baltimore left runners at first and third.Perhaps taking a cue from the Orioles, Tampa Bay loaded the bases with no outs in the eighth but did not score. In the bottom half, Baltimore wasted a one-out double by Davis.Longoria put the Rays up 1-0 in the first inning with his 25th home run, the second in two days. He has 11 extra-base hits in his last 12 games, including four homers.Singles by Escobar, Joyce and No. 9 hitter Kelly Johnson made it 2-0 in the second.In the bottom half, Danny Valencia got the last of three straight Baltimore hits, an RBI double. Valencia, recalled from Triple-A Norfolk before the game, went 2 for 2 with a walk against Price and is 9 for 12 lifetime against the lefty.The Orioles got three more hits in the third, including a run-scoring double off the center-field wall by Wieters to knot the score at 2. But Baltimore left two runners in scoring position for the second inning in a row.NOTES: The game took 3 hours, 56 minutes. ... The Rays activated Desmond Jennings (finger) from the disabled list and optioned RHP Brandon Gomes to Triple-A Durham. Jennings started atop the lineup and went 1 for 4. ... J.J. Hardy, who turned 31 on Monday, started at shortstop for Baltimore after missing two games with back spasms. ... Alex Cobb (7-2) starts for the Rays on Tuesday night against Baltimore RHP Miguel Gonzalez, who\'s 5-1 at home. ... Price walked only three of 258 batters over his previous nine starts.

Orioles Executive Vice President Of Baseball Operations Dan Duquette Discusses The Orioles And Hopes For The Rest Of The Season ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), ('Orioles Fall To Surging Rays 7-4 \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' BALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Looks as if the Baltimore Orioles are going to have to play catch-up again in their bid to make the playoffs. The Orioles managed only five hits and lost to the Tampa Bay Rays 7-4 Tuesday night, their sixth defeat in eight games. Baltimore fell to 67-58 and dropped six games behind the Red Sox in the AL East, pending Boston\xe2\x80\x99s late matchup against San Francisco. The Orioles also lost ground in the wild-card chase. A year ago, the Orioles were in third place on Aug. 22 with a 67-57 record. They rallied to make the postseason for the first time since 1997, and now they\xe2\x80\x99re hoping for a similar run. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised how quickly this season can slow down and things can turn, so you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be prepared to take advantage of that and we have the people to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt some point, some of the frustration they feel will start getting played out on the field toward the opposition.\xe2\x80\x9d Alex Cobb took a two-hitter into the seventh inning and Matt Joyce drove in three runs for the second-place Rays, who won the first two games of the series and will seek a sweep on Wednesday night. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very big for where we\xe2\x80\x99re at in the division and the fact we\xe2\x80\x99re chasing the Red Sox a little bit and also trying to create some distance, because we know the O\xe2\x80\x99s and the Yankees are very capable and very tough competitors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Zobrist, who had two hits and an RBI. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate it being any sort of easy road to the end of September and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to battle. This is two great wins for us to start off.\xe2\x80\x9d And for the Orioles, it was a horrid way to begin a six-game stretch at home against Tampa Bay and Oakland. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the position we would prefer to find ourselves in after the first two games of the series, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure, but there\xe2\x80\x99s still plenty of baseball left for us to make up some ground,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nate McLouth, who went 0 for 5. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not ideal at all, but we won\xe2\x80\x99t let this game affect (Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s) game.\xe2\x80\x9d Cobb (8-2) was making his second start since being hit in the head by a line drive off the bat of Kansas City\xe2\x80\x99s Eric Hosmer on June 15. The right-hander allowed two runs, one earned, three hits and four walks in six-plus innings to win his fifth straight decision. Cobb left after Baltimore used two walks and a single to load the bases with no outs in the seventh. Alex Torres got Brian Roberts to hit into a run-scoring double play before striking out McLouth to keep the Rays ahead 3-2. \xe2\x80\x9cThey brought in that lefty with that really good changeup to come in and do exactly what he did and that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re such a tough team,\xe2\x80\x9d McLouth said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause they can make life pretty tough on you.\xe2\x80\x9d Joyce doubled in two runs in the ninth off T.J. McFarland and Wil Myers added a broken-bat, two-run single off Jim Johnson. Matt Wieters hit a two-run homer in the bottom half before Fernando Rodney entered and got three outs for his 29th save. Orioles starter Miguel Gonzalez (8-6) gave up three runs, two earned, eight hits and four walks in 5 2-3 innings. The right-hander is 0-3 in five starts since July 20. One night after getting 15 hits in a 4-3 loss to Tampa Bay, Baltimore went quietly against Cobb and the Tampa Bay bullpen. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any hits. That\xe2\x80\x99s obvious,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to look for a reason, I personally look at Cobb, who was tough. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t do much off him tonight. I think that was it in a nutshell.\xe2\x80\x9d The Rays have won seven of eight against the Orioles to take an 8-5 lead in the season series. The two teams with the fewest errors in the majors each gave up an unearned run in the second inning. In the top half, Joyce walked, advanced on an errant pickoff throw by Gonzalez and scored on a two-out bloop by Yunel Escobar. Baltimore tied it when Evan Longoria muffed a grounder and Flaherty singled in a run with two outs. Tampa Bay went up 3-1 in the third. After Desmond Jennings walked and scored on a double by Zobrist, Longoria singled and Joyce delivered a sacrifice fly. Gonzalez worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the fifth by getting James Loney to bounce into a double play. NOTES: Zobrist moved into a fifth-place tie with B.J. Upton on the team\xe2\x80\x99s career RBI list with 447. Aubrey Huff is in fourth with 449. \xe2\x80\xa6 Jeremy Hellickson, who\xe2\x80\x99s 8-3 lifetime against Baltimore, starts for Tampa Bay in the series finale Wednesday night. LH Wei-Yin Chen will pitch for Baltimore. \xe2\x80\xa6 The Orioles had won five straight over the Rays with Gonzalez as the starter. \xe2\x80\xa6 McLouth is hitless in his last 17 at-bats.

Under the guidance of USA Table Tennis Hall of Famer Larry Hodges, four of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top juniors played in front of the Orioles before some of the players squared off against them.\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re having a great time,\xe2\x80\x9d Hodges said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were really nervous the first 10 minutes.

Encina | The Baltimore SunThe steady stream of fans rapidly heading toward the exits of Camden Yards in the ninth inning of the Orioles\' 7-4 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays on Tuesday night signaled that they had seen enough.A one-run game quickly spiraled into a five-run deficit for the Orioles, who would make it closer on Matt Wieters\' two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth but still suffered another costly loss to a team they\'re chasing for a playoff spot.With the loss, the Orioles \xe2\x80\x94 who have dropped six of their past eight games \xe2\x80\x94 fell to 5 \xc2\xbd games behind the Rays in the American League East standings. Tampa Bay\'s win, combined with Boston\'s late-night loss to San Francisco,\xc2\xa0placed the Rays and Red Sox in\xc2\xa0a first-place tie\xc2\xa0in the AL East. The Orioles are now four games out of the second AL Wild Card spot. var adSkipCounter = 0; For a team clinging to its playoff hopes, the Orioles have won just four of their past nine series and they\'ve won just five of 14 games against the division-rival Rays this season.\xe2\x80\x9cWe just need some things to go our way,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to make our own breaks.\xe2\x80\x9dAfter 125 games, the Orioles (67-58) are just one game behind last year\'s 93-win playoff team at this point of the season, but they will need to capitalize on upcoming games against teams ahead of them in the playoff race, namely the Red Sox, Oakland Athletics and the Rays.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s not the position we would prefer to find ourselves in after the first two games of the series, that\'s for sure,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles left fielder Nate McLouth said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\'s still plenty of baseball left for us to make up some ground. It\'s not ideal at all, but we won\'t let this game affect tomorrow\'s game.\xe2\x80\x9dThe baserunners weren\'t as plentiful and the scoring opportunities not as regular as Monday night, when the Orioles were 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position, but the Orioles still had a big inning basically gift-wrapped for them in the seventh \xe2\x80\x94 and they failed to capitalize.Trailing 3-1 in the seventh, the Orioles chased right-hander Alex Cobb (8-2) from the game after loading the bases with no outs, but they scraped just one run across the plate against left-handed reliever Alex Torres.Brian Roberts grounded the second pitch of his at-bat to third baseman Evan Longoria, who touched third and threw to second for a double play, one of three double plays the Orioles hit into. Wieters scored from third to make it a one-run game, but McLouth struck out looking on a full-count pitch to end the inning.Cobb finished allowing just three hits over six-plus innings.Orioles right-hander Miguel Gonzalez (8-6) failed to get through the sixth inning for the third time in his past five starts, allowing three runs and 12 baserunners \xe2\x80\x94 eight hits and four walks \xe2\x80\x94 over 5 2/3 innings before an announced 26,158 at Camden Yards.The Rays (72-52) came through with the bases loaded in the top of the ninth on Matt Joyce\'s two-run double off T.J. McFarland, giving Tampa Bay a 5-2 lead. Wil Myers\' two-run single against Jim Johnson gave the Rays a five-run cushion.Wieters hit his third homer in four games and his fourth in his past seven games, a two-run shot off Rays reliever Wesley Wright in the ninth. It was Wieters\' 19th homer of the season and his 15th career homer against Tampa Bay, most of any player against the Rays since 2009 and the most Wieters has hit against any opponent.Rays closer Fernando Rodney prevented further damage, retiring all three hitters he faced in the ninth, securing his 29th save of the season by striking out McLouth to end the game.Gonzalez labored throughout the evening, especially during a 24-pitch second inning in which the Rays scored their first run. His four walks were costly \xe2\x80\x94 two of them scoring.\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a tough one,\xe2\x80\x9d Gonzalez said. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst inning was great and then I just had to battle the other innings. It\'s tough to pitch against a team that is playing good. They got three infield hits and a couple broken-bat base hits. That\'s a tough one to swallow.\xe2\x80\x9dWith the game tied at 1 in the third, Gonzalez issued a one-out walk to Desmond Jennings, then allowed a double down the right-field line to Ben Zobrist that scored the speedy Jennings from first. After Longoria\'s single, which moved Zobrist to third, Joyce\'s sacrifice fly to right gave the Rays a 3-1 lead.The Orioles had tied the game in the second inning \xe2\x80\x94 benefitting from a two-out error on Longoria to score a run. Longoria, playing on the right side of the infield as part of a pull shift on Wieters, bobbled a grounder and couldn\'t get the throw to first in time to get Wieters. A full-count walk to Hardy moved Wieters to second, and Flaherty\'s single to right scored him to make is a 1-1 game.Flaherty\'s hit was the last one Cobb allowed until Hardy\'s seventh-inning single.Tuesday marked the first time the Orioles lost the first two games of a home series since July 8-9 against the Texas Rangers. But afterward Showalter \xe2\x80\x94 his team needing a win tonight to avoid a sweep \xe2\x80\x94 tried put a positive spin on the series.\xe2\x80\x9cWe look at it like we\'ve won two out of four [including two wins against the Colorado Rockies over the weekend] and tomorrow\'s the start of something good,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\'d be surprised how quickly this season can slow down and things can turn quickly, so you\'ve got to be prepared to take advantage of that, and we have the people to do it.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsAs the Baltimore Orioles host Oakland for three games beginning tonight at Camden Yards, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to wrap up the Tampa Bay series, the first three of seven games the Orioles had left against Tampa Bay.The first two were not easy to watch.Most championship teams, or close to it, have had weaknesses, but they ended up not mattering. I keep thinking how odd it is that\xc2\xa0Adam Jones has almost 30 more RBI than he did at this point last year and is hitting .300; Davis\xe2\x80\x99 season is the explosion that it is; and the defense is on the record pace that it is, but the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 record is just keeping pace with last year. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying the reasons aren\xe2\x80\x99t well-documented or I don\xe2\x80\x99t know them, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying you can never go into a season thinking if this or that performs as it did last year, a team will do great. It\xe2\x80\x99s too long a season to have predictions mean that much, due to slumps and injuries. Something goes right or exceeds expectations, but something else doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pan out.Monday night, Brian Roberts\xe2\x80\x98 0-for-5 game could have happened to anyone, and he had been on a \xc2\xa0roll, but at least two of the at-bats were over early. First-pitch outs with men on \xe2\x80\xa6 yes, those awful words again \xe2\x80\xa6 men on base. Ten left on in the first five innings is something you don\xe2\x80\x99t see every day. And it just kept going, until it reached 15 for the game.Jones sometimes seems to counterbalance the good job he does most of the time with at-bats like the one after Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x98 8th-inning double. Swing and a miss, foul ball, swing and a miss, have a seat, with a chance to tie the game. Why? Of course, arguing the other side, what if he had hit one of them? Still, it could not be called a productive at-bat.Davis\xe2\x80\x99 snare of an 8th inning line drive and conversion into a double play was greatness. Defensive play of the night. Alexi Casilla\xe2\x80\x98s steal in the bottom of the 9th? I do that with one out to stay out of a game-ending double play, but I hold him with none out. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a case both ways. He makes it and Nick Markakis gets a hit, it\xe2\x80\x99s tied. He stays put and Markakis hits it at somebody, it\xe2\x80\x99s a double play, but there\xe2\x80\x99s another hitter to go. It just didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out.The Rays delivered more pain the next night, when T.J. McFarland and Jim Johnson combined to give up four, 9th-inning runs in defeat. Karma finally arrived in the third game, when the Orioles salvaged the series with a win, and Matt Wieters threw out Kelly Johnson stealing for the game\xe2\x80\x99s final out. Prior to that, Tommy Hunter fielded a comebacker and went to second with it, forcing out the potential tie run. Majestic solo home runs by Jones and Davis were earlier highlights. It was Davis\xe2\x80\x99 46th, tying him with Jim Gentile for third-most in a season in club history.It was a game of economical run production. Jones plated a run in the first inning, grounding into a 6-5 force on the first pitch with the bases loaded.The numbers now say the Orioles are 68-58, 5 1/2 games out of first and 3 games behind both Tampa Bay and Oakland, this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s opponent, for a wild-card berth. They need to go 22-14 to win 90, and even just that much is better than the 15-15 pace they\xe2\x80\x99ve been on since the All Star Break. If you are a glass-half-full person, you can point to the fact that while the Orioles have not gained an inch on first place without falling back another inch since the break, neither has Boston pulled away.This weekend, the Orioles miss Bartolo Col\xc3\xb3n and A.J. Griffin, the only two A\xe2\x80\x99s pitchers with double-digit wins. Boston goes West to face the Dodgers for the weekend, and the Red Sox will miss Clayton Kershaw, who shut out the Miami Marlins yesterday. But the Dodgers haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone 45-10 since June 22 just by depending on him. They have posted a 1.86 team ERA during a recent 10-2 stretch.Boston is batting .318 and averaging 5.9 runs in interleague play \xe2\x80\x93 both the best marks in baseball. Shane Victorino (.455) and\xc2\xa0Jacoby Ellsbury\xc2\xa0(.438)\xc2\xa0own the top two AL batting averages in interleague play this season. Victorino, 11 for 22 over his last five games overall, is slugging .750 in 11 games against the NL, and Ellsbury has scored 16 runs in 15 interleague games.\xc2\xa0Carl Crawford has hit .467 (21 for 45) off John Lackey, Saturday night\xe2\x80\x99s Red Sox starter.So there are paper arguments in favor of both teams. Looking ahead, which is something experts do but not players, the Orioles travel to Fenway to face that Boston team following this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s Oakland series. But the Orioles have 3 1/2 games to gain on Oakland for potential wild-card consideration. Today is just as critical as tomorrow at this stage. Striking a familiar note,\xc2\xa0Oakland has batted .131 with runners in scoring position in its last nine games, including one extra-base hit and 15 strikeouts.Did I leave anybody out? Oh, right, the Yankees, a mere half game behind the O\xe2\x80\x99s in the wild card standings, visit the Rays this weekend. The Yankees have won a season-high five in a row since the return of the man the baseball world loves to despise, Alex Rodriguez.

The O's didn't gain on anyone, another team got in front of them in the wild card race, and they are now just one loss combined with a  Yankees win away from fourth place in the division. But it's not over yet!  Baltimore Orioles (68-58) 3rd place, A.L. East, 5 1/2 games behind Boston Red Sox\r 4th place, A.L. Wild Card, 3 games behind the Oakland A's The Orioles started off last weekend well, winning two out of three from the Colorado Rockies. But they went just 1-2 in the important series against the Rays, which means they're not a game further behind them in the division and the wild card. This week the Orioles have a chance to redeem themsevles in the crucial series department as they face off against the Oakland Athletics. If the Orioles manage to sweep the A's they'll be tied with them in the wild card race, but a sweep by the A's and they'll be six games behind them and effectively out of the race. No pressure. The O's follow that series with a three-game series in Boston against the Red Sox. That's also important, but how so will depend on the A's series.     Boston Red Sox (75-54) 1st place, A.L. East, 1 game ahead of the Tampa Bay Rays The Red Sox spent the last week just as the Orioles did: they went .500, with a 3-3 record. Things started off well as they dropped two of three to the Yankees, but then they went out west and won two games in San Francisco. The Red Sox have a tough weekend series ahead of them against the Dodgers. The Dodgers don't really lose, so hopefully they'll take care of business against our enemeis. After that the Red Sox fly home for three games against our Orioles.    Tampa Bay Rays (72-53) 2nd place, A.L. East, 1 game behind the Red Sox\r 1st place, A.L. Wild Card, 1 1/2 games ahead of the Oakland A's The Rays are one game behind of the Red Sox in the standings but actually have one less loss. They've played four fewer games than the Red Sox on the season, so despite being a game back they are really not in a bad position. Unlike the Red Sox and the Orioles, the Rays actually gained in the standings this week. They went 2-1 against both the Toronto Blue Jays and the O's to bring them a game closer to first place. Starting tonight they have three games at home against the Yankees, a makeup game in Kansas City on Monday, and three games at home against the Angels. I'm going to just assume they are going to sweep the Angels. As for the Yankees series, it's tough to know who to root for in that instance. Maybe if they go 1-2 against the Yankees while the O's sweep the A's, that'd be the best scenario.     New York Yankees (68-59) 4th place, A.L. East, 6 games behind the Red Sox\r 5th place, A.L. Wild Card, 3 1/2 games behing A's, 1/2 game behind O's The Yankees had a very good week. I mean, it was good if you're a Yankee or a Yankees fan. For everyone else it was terrible. First they took two out of three from the Red Sox, which I was ok with at the time, but then they went on to win all four games against the Blue Jays. Their 6-1 week helped them gain in both races and they are now just 1/2 game behind the Orioles. It's been mentioned a few places this week, but if you haven't seen it I'd like to point out that the the Yankees have dominated the Blue Jays this year. In fact, the Blue Jays are single handedly responsible for allowing the Yankees to remain relevent. The Yankees are 12-1 against the Blue Jays. Against the rest of baseball they are 56-59. The Jays have a 1-12 record against the Yankees. Against the rest of baseball they are 56-59.   Oakland Athletics (71-55) 2nd place, A.L. West, 2 1/2 games behind the Texas Rangers\r 2nd place, A.L. Wild Card, 1 1/2 games behind the Rays, 3 games ahead of the O's The A's were another team who went .500 this week. They went 2-1 against the Indians and were poised to gain ground in the standings, but then lost a series to the Mariners. We know how that feels. After the big weekend series again the Orioles, the A's have a four-game series against the Detroit Tigers. The Tigers are obviously going to win the A.L. Central so we don't need to worry about them, so here's hoping the A's get swept. Cleveland Indians (69-58) 2nd place, A.L. Central, 5 games behind the Tigers\r 3rd place, A.L. Wild Card, 2 1/2 games behind the A's, 1/2 game ahead of the O's Seriously, Indians? You're trying to contend? So inconvenient. The Indians went 1-2 against the A's last weekend, but gained in the wild card race thanks to a three-game sweep of the completely useless Angels. They have another cake walk this weekend\r with three home games against the Twins, but then thankfully travel to Atlanta where they will hopefully be demolished by the first-place Braves. That reminds me, I'm very glad that the Orioles are finished with interleague play.  TL;DR - Who should I root for this weekend? In addition to the Orioles, you should definitely root for the Dodgers and Twins. As for the Rays/Yankees series, well, that's a personal decision.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Durham (RHP) Jake Odorizzi, who came over from the Royals organization along with Wil Myers (seriously unremarked upon point: the Rays came away with, not only Myers (the best or 2nd best offensive prospect in all of baseball) but also the Royals best / most advanced pitching prospect in Odorizzi, along with a tremendous lotto ticket arm in Mike Montgomery who was once a top-notch prospect) confounded the Tides\' hitters in this game, going 8 innings of shutout pitching while allowing just 5 baserunners and whiffing 11. (LF) Henry Urrutia did the only significant damage to Odorizzi, hitting a double. (DH) Wilson Betemit and (2B) Jonathan Schoop went a combined 0-7, w/ 2 Ks. (RHP) Eddie \'Gamblor\' Gamboa had a mercurial night. Going 5.1 IP, he allowed only 3 hits and struck out 4 but also walked 3 and allowed 3 runs (2 earned) while uncorking 1 wild pitch. ( C ) Chris Snyder limited the Passed Balls to just 1 this go \'round, but did allow 2 successful stolen base attempts in 2 tries. (LHP) Mike Belfiore pitched 2.2 innings of scoreless relief, allowing 2 hits & a walk while K\'ing 3. He has had a quietly good season and gives the O\'s another southpaw option in the \'pen come September. Could he perhaps allow the O\'s to shop a Troy Patton or Brian Matusz come this off-season? New Britain (Twins) 2, Bowie 0 This result is more understandable than the Norfolk one, simply due to the nature of the offensive talent on the Bowie roster currently. It\'s dreadful. Twins top pitching prospect, (RHP) Alex Meyer returned from a lengthy absence due to injury to toss 5 strong innings. Like the Tides, the Baysox managed just one double for their lone extra base hit of the game. But unlike the Tides, the Baysox did manage to draw 5 walks with (LF) Kyle Hudson drawing 3 of these from the lead-off slot in the lineup. (LHP) Jake Petit was solid himself, going 6 IP and allowing 5 hits, 2 walks, 1 earned run, and 1 HBP while striking out 4 and picking off 1 runner from 1st. Twins \xc3\x9cber-prospect (3B) Miguel Sano went 2-4 on the night, with a double and 2 Ks. Frederick 1, Lynchburg (Braves) 3 The Keys managed to scratch out a run, but channeled their inner-Orioles by going 1-7 with RISP and leaving 7 runners stranded on the basepaths. Every starter save for (3B) Jason Esposito had a hit on the night. ( C ) Michael Ohlman went 1-4, w/ a K and was 2/2 in throwing out potential base stealers. And (RF) Dariel Alvarez went 2-4, with an evidently highlight reel worthy Outfield Assist to gun down a runner at Home. Let the always entertaining Keys\' video guy, Reggie, state it: <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p>The <a href=""https://twitter.com/darielalvarez64"">@darielalvarez64</a> gun show. Don&#39;t.

He only K\'d 1 and had an 8:3 Ground out to Fly out ratio. (2B) Travis Adair isn\'t a prospect in any sense, but he is currently sporting a 15 game hit streak. Delmarva 1, Lakewood (Phillies) 2 The Gregory Lorenzo-in-the-lead-off-spot majik seems to have worn off of late, as he went 1-5, w/ 3 Ks tonight. Dude needs to learn how to take a walk. (SS) Adrian Marin followed Lorenzo in the order and 1 upped him in ineptitude, going 0-5 w/ 1 K. Offense for the Shorebirds came via (DH) Nik Balog (3-4) and (LF) Creede Simpson (2-4, w/ 1 RBI).    19 year old (RHP) Luc Rennie pitched well again: 5 IP, 2 H, 2 BBs, 1 ER, 5 Ks. He has now pitched 7 consecutive starts of 5+ IP with 3 or fewer runs allowed with a 28 to 8 K:BB ratio over 39 IP. Look for him to possibly crack some Top 10 lists or be mentioned as \'One to Watch\' come this off-season. (RHP) Mychal Givens put up 2 innings of solid relief work, allowing a hit and a walk while whiffing 3. Connecticut (Tigers) 2, Aberdeen 5 The Ironbirds wanted to join in the offensive offense theme of the night, but were gifted a 3 run 8th inning thanks in part to 2 throwing errors by the Tigers. (RF) Mike Yastrzemski went 1-3, w/ a BB and a K. He continues to impress. Not sure what his ultimate potential is, but he\'s made himself an interesting prospect for the moment; at least at the lower levels. (1B) Trey Mancini is also interesting for the time being. He went 1-3, w/ an RBI. (LF) Conor Bierfeldt is also a smidge intriguing. He went 2-4, w/ a 2B and, like Dariel Alvarez, threw out a runner at Home. (3B) Hector Veloz\' blah season meanders on: 0-3, w/ a BB and 2 Ks. ( C ) Pedro Perez was absolutely abused behind the dish. He allowed 6 SBs in 6 attempts. ooof. A trio of interesting arms pitched for the Ironbirds. (RHP) Alex Santana got the start. He has been carefully handled thus far, with strict and low pitch counts limiting him to 3 or fewer innings. In this game he went 2.1 IP and allowed 2 hits and 1 earned run, but did walk 3 and HBP 1 while striking out just 1. (RHP) Dylan Rheault came on and was effective in his own right, going 4.2 IP while allowing just 1 run via 2 hits and 1 walk, while K\'ing 6. Finally, (RHP) Jimmy Yacobonis came on to pitch the final 2 frames. He issued 2 walks and a HBP but allowed on runs or hits while striking out 2.

08/26/2013,"[('Birds Watcher: Baltimore Orioles: The 2013 Homestretch', 'The 2013 season for the Baltimore Orioles is now exactly 80% in the books. The current record is 70-59. They were 71-58 at this same point last year. So can it be done? Are they really able yet to realistically make a return to the playoffs?Aug 25, 2013; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles left fielder Nate McLouth (9) is congratulated by third base coach Bobby Dickerson (11) after hitting a two-run home run in the eighth inning against the Oakland Athletics at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles defeated the Athletics 10-3. Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsIn 2012, the Orioles did indeed win two out of every three games over the final 33 \xe2\x80\x93 for a record of 22-11 and seasonal total of 93-69. It will take at least that same effort this year \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe even more. Nate McLouth was asked about the team needing to win two of every three for the rest of the way, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe just have to play well. We played well this series (against Oakland). We got on a roll offensively (speaking of Sunday) and it\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking to continue to do on this road trip.\xe2\x80\x9dThe final 20% of the season last year featured win streaks of six and four consecutive games. And as with each year, the final stretch features AL East opponents (26 games), along with another contending team \xe2\x80\x93 the Indians (3 games, with the remaining 4 games against the White Sox). \xc2\xa0Buck Showalter spoke of the portion of the season already completed as playing to get yourself into a position of contention over the final five weeks.I cannot get myself out too far on any limb on this one \xe2\x80\xa6 as I can see scenarios where the Orioles have a really strong shot at repeating 2012, yet others where it is not at all unreasonable to have grave concerns. This is a better offensive team for sure, the greatest defensive team ever, but also a team where the bullpen has killed them over and over.Bullpen ThoughtsThere is no hope for the Orioles unless the bullpen improves over their performance covering the first 80% of the season. Though a repeat of the incredible pen of 2012 was unrealistic, I doubt many Orioles fans, observers, and writers actually thought the drop in performance would be this severe.Jim Johnson is a mystery. If there is someone who can explain the funk he fell into this year \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not read anything about that. Even before he started getting shelled and blowing games, even I could notice on TV that he was not right \xe2\x80\x93 that the ball was just not moving enough on any of his pitches. However, this past Friday night, his stuff was as good as I\xe2\x80\x99ve practically ever seen it. If he can bring THAT stuff into each game the rest of the way, the Birds have a real shot at getting somewhere. If Johnson or Bill Castro or anyone else around the team can identify what it is that was different this past outing, well, that would be critically valuable information.Speaking of closers (a category of player I think is about as rare as sighting Elvis Presley or a unicorn alive), I always was a fan of Koji Uehara as a closer candidate. He was never really given a shot at it in Baltimore, and I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t begrudge a trade of him to Texas that brought back Chris Davis and Tommy Hunter. But has anyone noticed how well he is doing in Boston? Among AL closers, his 1.24 ERA is the best, as opponents since the All-Star break are hitting but .111 against him. He has not been scored upon since June 30th!\xc2\xa0 A writer on our network reported that he has posted the best strikeout to walk ratio in Major League Baseball history!\xc2\xa0 I did not verify that, but that he practically never walks anyone was very evident when he pitched with the Orioles. And that is why I like the guy as a closer (if you have go with the lemmings crowd and designate a specific person as filling this mythical role). He would have been a nice addition to the Orioles, and he would have liked to play again in Baltimore. But, the need was not evident at the time. Now he is on an opponent\xe2\x80\x99s team whom the Orioles have to play nine times over the final 33 games. It is enough to make you wish to have Jonathon Papelbon back!\xc2\xa0 (Actually, there is nothing that could make me want to see pucker face back again, other than that the Orioles could beat him around the yard.)Aug 25, 2013; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles right fielder Nick Markakis (21) hits a solo home run in the eighth inning against the Oakland Athletics at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsMarkakis and Performance Enhancing DrugsHow\xe2\x80\x99s that for a heading?\xc2\xa0 Yes, after 31 games without an extra base hit, Nick Markakis breaks out with a double and homer. How do we account for this sudden outburst of power? Well obviously it has to be PEDs \xe2\x80\x93 just ask that crew that accuses Chris Davis of the same!The Return of BetemitThere is an extended discussion on Roch Kubatko\xe2\x80\x99s MASN page about Wilson Betemit coming off his rehab assignment and the complications it presents for the roster. It involves the sort of technicalities about which I have no patience to understand let alone write. So O\xe2\x80\x99s fans out there \xe2\x80\x93 are you pumped up to get Wilson back? Apparently he is projected to be the DH against righties the rest of the way, since he posted a .302 average against them last season. I can\xe2\x80\x99t dispute the statistic, but he must have gotten all those hits over the 30% of game times when I was not watching and made all his outs on the 70% when I was tuned in (Just like, I swear, Derek Jeter is batting about .600 to .700 when I\xe2\x80\x99m watching). I am willing to come back in mid October and beat myself with an iron pipe if I\xe2\x80\x99ve been ungenerous and the Orioles owe their World Series victory run to the bat of Betemit! But I\xe2\x80\x99m not excited about it right now \xe2\x80\xa6 just sayin\xe2\x80\x99. Apparently he is not running well \xe2\x80\x93 another thing I have little patience with as a running coach over the years!Former O\xe2\x80\x99s and HoesJake Arrieta is getting the start tonight for the Cubs against the Dodgers in LA and Zack Greinke. Good luck with that Jake (and I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet he\xe2\x80\x99ll be doubling down on adjusting his cap three, four, five times between every pitch!). He has only pitched 17 innings in Chicago, starting 3 games, with a 1-0 record and 3.71 ERA.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m picking on him here, but I really do wish the guy well \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s a really nice person.Kevin Gregg, also with the Cubs, is having a fine season. Over 51 games he boasts a 3.18 ERA, which would be the best of his entire career. He has 26 saves, though he still gives up 4.6 walks per 9 innings. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy for Gregg \xe2\x80\x93 really, I am \xe2\x80\xa6 as critical as I was of the guy. But I remain happy that he is wearing someone else\xe2\x80\x99s uniform too.L.J. Hoes is succeeding in Houston, batting .329 in 88 plate appearances. He also has seven stolen bases over that time. And to all of that I say, \xe2\x80\x9cGood for him!\xe2\x80\x9dOK \xe2\x80\xa6 so, two of three the rest of the way. They are 11 games over .500 for the first 80% of the season, and will need to be 11 games over for the final 20% \xe2\x80\xa6 not a worry, just a fact. Win now! ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles release Lew Ford - Camden Chat', "" Per Roch Kubatko this afternoon, the news came out that the Orioles have released outfielder Lew Ford.  #orioles have transferred Cuban OF Dariel Alvarez from Class A Frederick to AA Bowie and released OF Lew Ford\r \xe2\x80\x94 Roch Kubatko (@masnRoch) August 26, 2013    The move was apparently made to make room for Dariel Alvarez at Bowie and in that sense it's not at all surprising or outrageous. I wouldn't normally blink at a tweet like that, but Lew Ford was part of the magical 2012 season for the Orioles, just one more long shot that contributed to the team in some way. Before being called up by the Orioles on July 29, 2012, Ford hadn't been on a major league roster since 2007 with the Minnesota Twins. After the Twins released him, he refused to give up and played some form of baseball every season between 2007 and 2012. He played in Japan in 2008 and split time between the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic Independent League and in AAA with the Reds in 2009. 2010 saw him in the Mexican League, 2011 back with the Ducks. He finally signed a minor league contract with the Orioles on May 17, 2012. There were some laughs about it when it happened, because what could a 35-year-old who hadn't been on a major league team in five years do for the Orioles?    The truth was, he didn't do much. In 79 plate appearances with the Orioles in 2012 he hit .183/.256/.352. But he had a few timely hits and just the fact that he was there endeared him to the fans. Most memorable to me, of course, was the run he scored in the\xc2\xa0A.L. Wild Card game. He was just pinch running for Jim Thome, but he came in to score on a single by Manny Machado. The Orioles won a postseason game where 20-year-old Machado knocked in 35-year-old Ford, who was running for 41-year-old Thome. It was just such a 2012 Oriole moment. Ford started this season with AAA Norfolk but was sent down to AA Bowie mid-way through the year. He had to know the end was coming soon. I don't know if Ford will try to find another team to play for, or if he'll look into coaching or, if at 36 years of age, he'll finally walk away from baseball. But I'll always have a place in my heart for him. He was part of what made the 2012 season so unbelievable, and it's awesome for him that no matter what, he'll always have this:                                    Year Age Tm Series Opp G PA AB R H 2B HR RBI BA OBP SLG OPS    2012 35 BAL ALWC TEX 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0       2012 35 BAL ALDS NYY 3 8 8 1 3 1 0 1 .375 .375 .500 .875     Provided by Baseball-Reference.com: View Original TableGenerated 8/26/2013.

Throwing a baseball at high speeds is an inherently unnatural act, and pitchers have always gotten hurt. But this is an era of such heightened caution that Harvey said he was shocked to learn the severity of his problem after a magnetic resonance imaging exam Monday. He felt no pop, no shooting pain. Years ago, he probably would have just kept pitching.On the career list for innings pitched, you have to scroll down to Mike Mussina, at 66th, to find a pitcher who made his debut in the last 25 seasons. Yet despite the smaller workloads, more pitchers are missing significant time with elbow injuries.

He wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that he would be back on April 1, but Alderson said that was news to him.

It's a weird mix of players from all levels, some of whom aren't any kind of prospects at all. But it's baseball and it's in the fall, and sometimes it's interesting to see who is in favor. The Orioles announced on Tuesday who will be sent to the AFL from the organization. All of the O's players will be playing for the Surprise Saguros, which will have Double-A Bowie manager Gary Kendall as its manager, and Alan Mills as its pitching coach. Other players on the team will be from the Boston, Texas, Cleveland, and Milwaukee organizations. Position players: Henry Urrutia, Dariel Alvarez, Jonathan Schoop; Michael Ohlman (taxi squad)Pitchers: Eduardo Rodriguez, Jason Gurka, Branden Kline, Tim Berry AFL action begins on October 8, so this will not affect anyone's possible September call-up status. Urrutia has already appeared for the O's this season and Schoop has been mentioned as a player who will be seriously considered.    Urrutia and Alvarez are both recent Cuban signees who could use any at-bats against American professional competition, so their inclusion is not a surprise. Schoop missed time with a stress fracture in a lower back, and could also use the extra work for that reason. Ohlman being on the taxi squad means he can only play twice a week, but it'll still be an opportunity for him to be exposed to some players at higher levels, and also give the Orioles more of a chance to evaluate him. He's batted .308/.409/.524 in 93 games for High-A Frederick this season. Rodriguez struggled early at Double-A but has had three excellent starts in a row. It's no surprise either that the O's would like to keep him sharp against some potentially top competition. Berry, Gurka, and Kline probably don't matter at all and are just a reflection of the fact that they had to send somebody.    To get an idea of the AFL and how much it matters, or doesn't, here's a list of the players the Orioles sent two years ago: Steve Johnson, Cole McCurry; Xavier Avery, Joe Mahoney, Casey Lambert; Brian Ward, Sean Gleason. Most of those are names that didn't matter and were never going to matter. Neither Avery nor Johnson were launched into stardom in the AFL, but you never know who might get enough polish with the extra work to make their way higher up.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Johnson has compiled an American League-leading 41 saves, becoming a prime example of the save statistic\xe2\x80\x99s flaws.The roots of the problem can be traced to 1960. Holtzman, a sportswriter in Chicago, was trying to prove the flaws inherent in another statistic: wins.Holtzman wanted to demonstrate for readers that Roy Face, a Pittsburgh reliever who won 18 games in 1959, was actually less effective in that heavily publicized season than he was in 1958, when he won only five games.Borrowing a seldom-used term, the save, which at the time was awarded to any relief pitcher who got the final out in a victory, Holtzman redefined it for The Sporting News to resemble the way it is used now. By Holtzman\xe2\x80\x99s count, Face saved 20 games in 1958 but only 10 in 1959. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Unfortunately for Holtzman, who was renowned in the business and who went on to become baseball\xe2\x80\x99s official historian, the save statistic has proved every bit as problematic as wins, with Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s numbers creating one of the bigger arguments against its validity.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  If saves are removed from the equation, Johnson becomes something less than spectacular. Through Thursday, his adjusted earned run average, which takes into account a pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s league and home park, was 97th in the majors among pitchers with 50 or more innings. Johnson had allowed an overall batting average of .276, which was 216th best among pitchers. He had also allowed the 11th-most base runners of any full-time reliever.In terms of a modern metric like wins above replacement, Johnson was more effective in 2011, the year before he became a full-time closer, than he has been in either of the last two seasons despite his major-league-leading 92 saves. As his salary has increased, along with his profile, Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s WAR has gone from 2.7 to 2.4 to 0.6. He has nine blown saves and seven losses this season, and one of his three wins came after a blown save.On the basis of his prodigious save totals, though, he is likely to receive a hefty raise for next season, his last year of arbitration.

Privacy Policy    The two bright spots have been Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Tommy Hunter, who have surpassed Johnson in terms of effectiveness. Yet Johnson, carrying the label of closer, continues to get the plush assignment of pitching to start the ninth inning. On Thursday he came through, protecting a one-run lead against Boston.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  On Friday at Yankee Stadium, the Orioles began a three-game series that could greatly affect their postseason chances.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  With the redefined save statistic, the flaw that Holtzman could not see coming was that it would lead managers to pick a reliever \xe2\x80\x94 not always the best reliever \xe2\x80\x94 and have him pitch almost always in save situations. It creates a self-sustaining cycle in which a pitcher is rarely asked to pitch in difficult situations and often piles up saves regardless of how well he is performing.In 61 games this season, Johnson has been asked to pitch more than one inning just once and has entered with a lead 52 times. All of his blown saves were his own creation: he was not asked to deal with an inherited runner in any of the nine games in which he gave away the lead. In all, he has dealt with only 11 inherited runners and allowed four of them to score.Compare Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s season with that of the far less known Paco Rodriguez of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Rodriguez, earning a salary roughly 7.6 percent of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s, had inherited a major-league-leading 61 runners through Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s games. He let only 14 of them score, a percentage that easily trumped Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s. Along the way, Rodriguez outperformed Johnson in adjusted E.R.A., WAR and virtually every other meaningful statistic.For his deft maneuvering in a continual high-wire act, Rodriguez had been awarded two saves.It would be ridiculous to suggest that teams do not benefit from having an ace reliever. Anyone who has watched the Yankees in the postseason over the last two decades understands the value of Mariano Rivera. But Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s value has been measured not only by his save totals but also by his overall ability to shut down the other team in any given situation.

At the time, it seemed that Machado, 21, could be a serious challenger to Earl Webb, who has held the record for doubles in a season, with 67, since 1931. There was no way anyone could have known that would be the only double Machado would hit that month.The lesson Machado\xe2\x80\x99s season is teaching fans is that the three trickiest words in baseball can often be \xe2\x80\x9con pace for.\xe2\x80\x9dAfter that July game, Machado was on pace for about 71 doubles. Now, with 28 games left, Machado has 46 doubles and is on pace for 56, which would be the highest total since Garret Anderson hit 56 in 2002. The strange part is that 56 would feel disappointing after all the hype.Statistics, in general, can enhance the enjoyment of a sport, but they can also take away some of its magic. There was a time \xe2\x80\x94 when the various split statistics of a baseball player\xe2\x80\x99s year were not readily accessible online \xe2\x80\x94 that Machado would simply be having one of the best seasons for a player his age. But a quick search of Baseball-Reference.com shows that Machado struggled mightily in July, hitting .196 with a .314 slugging percentage in 25 games, somewhat dampening the enthusiasm.

Credit             Nick Wass/Associated Press           The reality of the situation is that Machado\xe2\x80\x99s doubles pace briefly fell off for two reasons: He has played in every game this season and quite likely wore down temporarily; and doubles have a tendency to come in bunches. The good news for the Orioles is that his hitting recovered in August, even if the doubles pace did not return.

In 1996, Edgar Martinez, the longtime Seattle Mariners designated hitter, had a record 42 doubles at the All-Star break \xe2\x80\x94 three more than Machado\xe2\x80\x99s 39 \xe2\x80\x94 but went on to hit only 10 more the rest of the season. Craig Biggio, the Houston Astros star, had 38 first-half doubles in 1999 and finished with 56. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Splits were not readily available in 1931, so few knew at the time that Webb\xe2\x80\x99s record-setting season had fluctuations as well. Webb, an outfielder for the Boston Red Sox, hit as many as 18 in a month (July) and as few as 5 (April). But one thing he had going for him that Machado does not was a home-field advantage. Webb played in Fenway Park, which has dimensions that aid a right-handed doubles hitter. He finished with 39 doubles at home and 28 on the road. Machado, who plays at a relatively neutral park in Baltimore, has been better on the road, with a split of 22/24.In a many ways it is probably better for Machado that his pace fell off. The last thing the Orioles need, in the thick of a wild-card race, would be the pursuit of an individual record as a distraction from the team\xe2\x80\x99s overall effort. And Machado, playing exceptional defense at third base, makes plenty of other contributions.But with yet another player falling off Webb\xe2\x80\x99s pace, the season will almost assuredly end with one of the least likely record-holders in baseball holding on for one more season: 83 years and counting.

Encina | The Baltimore SunNEW YORK \xe2\x80\x94 Throughout the many obstacles of a long baseball season, the Orioles clubhouse is usually flowing with optimism, even during the toughest moments.But following a deflating 2-0 loss to the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium on Saturday afternoon, there was a sense inside a tension-filled visiting clubhouse that opportunity might be starting to slip away as the calendar turns to September.A jarring sense of realism hit the Orioles (71-63) as they dropped to fourth place in the American League East standings for the first time since June 8, surpassed by the Yankees (72-63), who won their sixth straight home game thanks to a complete-game effort by right-hander Ivan Nova. var adSkipCounter = 0; The Orioles managed just three hits \xe2\x80\x94 all singles \xe2\x80\x94 in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s loss. In the first five games of their nine-game road trip, the Orioles have scored just 13 runs, their lowest offensive production of any five-game stretch this season.And after losing four of their past five and dropping each of the first two series of the road trip against the Boston Red Sox and Yankees \xe2\x80\x94 two division rivals that are fighting for postseason berths \xe2\x80\x94 the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 playoff hopes are dwindling.With 28 games remaining in the regular season, the Orioles enter Sunday no better than four games out of the second AL wild-card spot.\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to play good,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have long. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a whole lot left. The back\xe2\x80\x99s kind of up against the wall. We need to start playing good baseball.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles have also lost seven of their past 12 series. They\xe2\x80\x99ve now lost all three series this season at Yankee Stadium after winning all three in New York last season. They are just eight games over .500 for the first time since July 10. Baltimore is also 18-20 since the All-Star break, hardly the late-season performance of a playoff-worthy team.\xe2\x80\x9cWe still have the opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d catcher Matt Wieters said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re still playing the same teams that are fighting for the playoffs like we are. We know we need to start playing better and we need to win games. There\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit of urgency to where we just need to get going. We know we\xe2\x80\x99re still in it. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of putting together a good run at the end of the year.\xe2\x80\x9dDespite one of right-hander Scott Feldman\xe2\x80\x99s best performances since coming to the Orioles \xe2\x80\x94 he held the Yankees to one run and six hits over seven innings \xe2\x80\x94 Baltimore was unable to take advantage of Feldman\xe2\x80\x99s fourth straight start of allowing two or fewer earned runs. Feldman has a 1.88 ERA over that span.Three batters into the game, the Yankees took a 1-0 lead on Robinson Cano\xe2\x80\x99s one-out RBI double to right field. But Feldman allowed just four hits after that. Feldman worked his cutter and sinker to induce several critical groundouts, including a pair of rally-killing double plays from Derek Jeter to end both the fifth and seventh innings.\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the first inning, he got his feet on the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said of Feldman. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\'s got a lot of weapons. He was going to throw a cutter, he\'s got some fastball. He\'s very athletic, very competitive. He knows what works and what doesn\'t.\xe2\x80\x9dEverything was working for Nova, who has back-to-back complete-game wins against the Orioles and is 2-0 with a 1.52 ERA in three starts against Baltimore this season. In his last start against the Orioles, he earned a complete-game win in a 3-2 victory on July 5.The Orioles mounted just one true threat against Nova (8-4), putting the first two hitters on base in the second inning after Adam Jones was hit by a pitch and Matt Wieters hit a single. But Nick Markakis hit into a 4-6-3 double play.\xe2\x80\x9cI think he had the best sinker I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him have in the many times we\xe2\x80\x99ve faced him,\xe2\x80\x9d Wieters said of Nova. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was down, he was able to use his sinker to get a lot of ground balls. His curveball is his pitch that I think has come on lately but his sinker what was able to get him some early outs and that was able to get him deep in the game.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t get another hit until Manny Machado\xe2\x80\x99s two-out single in the sixth and had just four baserunners after Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 second-inning single. Hardy drew a full-count walk to open the eighth, but Wilson Betemit hit a ball into the hole at short that Jeter made a back-handed play on and turned into a 6-4-3 double play.\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a shot there at first and second early in the game and he got a double play ball, and he seemed to be able to dial up whatever he needed,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cWilson hit a ball right on the button and they turned a big double play. We had him on the ropes a couple times and he got out of it with ground balls.\xe2\x80\x9dLeadoff hitter Nate McLouth reached on an infield single in the ninth inning on a ball that hit off Nova\xe2\x80\x99s glove, but Chris Davis hit a fly ball to the warning track in right field and Adam Jones ended the game with a lineout to Jeter at shortstop.Now the Orioles must regroup to avoid a sweep and build some momentum heading into another important series in Cleveland against the Indians.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just not putting anything together,\xe2\x80\x9d Hardy said. \xe2\x80\x9cPitchers are tough. \xe2\x80\xa6 You just got to figure it out and make something happen.

Encina | The Baltimore SunNEW YORK \xe2\x80\x94 After careful research and tedious tweaks to the starting rotation schedule over the past month, the Orioles aligned their rotation so that right-hander Miguel Gonzalez could start the team\'s series opener at Yankee Stadium on Friday night.Gonzalez had dominated in the Bronx, pitching to a 2.20 ERA in five previous outings, including an strong American League Division Series start here last season. But Friday\'s 8-5 loss to the Yankees before an announced 45,169 was a painful lesson that the playoff race isn\'t played on paper.Gonzalez was chased from the game before getting an out in the fifth inning, sending the Orioles to their third loss in their first four games of this critical nine-game road trip to Boston, New York and Cleveland. They must now win their final two games at Yankee Stadium to avoid their seventh series loss in their past 12. var adSkipCounter = 0; With Friday\'s defeat, the Orioles (71-62) fell to 7 \xc2\xbd games out of first place in the AL East and failed to gain any ground in the wild-card chase with just 29 games left in the regular season.\xe2\x80\x9cPeople can say what they want,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orioles right fielder Nick Markakis, who had a team-high three hits on the night. \xe2\x80\x9cI like our chances, I like the position we\'re in. We do well under pressure. We know what we\'re up against, we just got to keep fighting. We still have a lot of baseball left. Anything can happen in this game.\xe2\x80\x9dWorking after his longest layoff between starts this season \xe2\x80\x94 he went nine days between starts and worked two brief relief stints in between \xe2\x80\x94 Gonzalez (8-7) allowed a season-high seven earned runs on six hits in four-plus innings.\xe2\x80\x9cThe first three innings were about as good as you\'d want to see,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cSome things just don\'t make a whole lot of sense, but you don\'t dwell on them. We learn from them.\xe2\x80\x9dOver the first four games of the road trip, Orioles starters have pitched to a 8.10 ERA (18 earned runs in 20 innings), and that includes Chris Tillman\'s seven-inning, two-run gem Thursday in Boston.Gonzalez held the Yankees (71-63) hitless for 3 2/3 innings, but his night quickly unraveled, thanks to first-pitch two-run homers by Alfonso Soriano and Ichiro Suzuki.After facing the minimum through 11 batters, Gonzalez issued a four-pitch walk to Robinson Cano. Soriano then took a fastball the opposite way into the right-field stands to give the Yankees a 2-1 lead. It was Soriano\'s 12th homer in 32 games since the Yankees traded for him on July 26.\xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Gonzalez said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\'t even explain it. It was a tough one. Tough one. First couple of innings, everything was moving well. All of a sudden in the fourth inning, I make a good pitch to Soriano. You\'ve got to tip your hat sometimes. He went the other way with it.\xe2\x80\x9dMarkakis opened the fifth with an infield single off Yankees lefty CC Sabathia. Then Orioles designated hitter Danny Valencia took a 1-1 pitch into the Orioles bullpen in left-center for his sixth homer of the season, giving the Orioles a 3-2 lead. Four of Valencia\'s six homers this season have given the Orioles the lead. A two-out RBI single by Manny Machado made it a 4-2 game.But that lead would be short-lived, as Gonzalez was chased from the game in a five-run bottom of the fifth.Curtis Granderson and former Oriole Mark Reynolds opened the frame with back-to-back doubles, quickly cutting the lead to one. Then Ichiro slapped a two-run homer into the right-field seats that turned that one-run Orioles lead into a one-run deficit.Gonzalez continued to struggle, allowing a double to No. 9 hitter Austin Romine, a single to Brett Gardner and a walk to Derek Jeter to lead the bases. Lefty T.J. McFarland entered and allowed a two-run single to Robinson Cano to give the Yankees a 7-4 lead.\xe2\x80\x9c[Gonzalez] just lost command there and it happens,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\'s not the only guy that it\'s ever happened to. ... It got away from him. A lot of times he might do it for a hitter in the past and he gets right back in stride. He just couldn\'t seem to get back into a consistent release point.""The Orioles cut the gap to two on Markakis\' two-out RBI single in the sixth, which scored Jones from second, but the Yankees added another insurance run in the Alex Rodriguez\'s two-out RBI single in the seventh. Sabathia (12-11) earned the win despite allowing five runs on seven hits over 5 2/3 innings.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\'re playing our division,\xe2\x80\x9d Valencia said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\'re playing guys who we\'re battling for our division and the wild card. Every gam means something. It seems like an emotional roller coaster when you\'re playing these games \xe2\x80\x94 lots of ups and downs \xe2\x80\x94 but we just have to keep playing good baseball.\xe2\x80\x9dChris Davis gave the Orioles a 1-0 lead in the fourth with a two-out RBI single. It gave him 122 RBIs on the season, the fifth highest single-season total in club history, tying Frank Robinson\'s AL-leading total in 1966.With two games remaining in the Bronx, the Orioles look to have a short memory and aim to put another frustrating loss behind them.\xe2\x80\x9cMove to the next day,\xe2\x80\x9d Markakis said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\'t change what\'s happened. All of us are focused on tomorrow and coming out [Saturday] and getting a \xe2\x80\x98W.\' We got a lot of baseball left. We got, what, [29] games left? It\'s a tight division, a tight race. We\'re not out of it until they say we\'re out of it.

They are trailing in the chase for a playoff spot, and one pitch, one faulty swing, a base-running mistake or a fateful decision by the manager could doom them.On Sunday, with the hope of a three-game sweep against the Baltimore Orioles within reach, it was a fateful decision by their manager, Joe Girardi, that was their undoing. Girardi, who all season had turned with confidence to his remarkably reliable bullpen in critical situations, did so once again, but this time the results were calamitous.The Yankees were protecting a three-run lead in the seventh inning with Andy Pettitte yet to allow a run. But in stunning succession, the combined efforts of three relief pitchers resulted in seven runs as the Orioles rallied for a 7-3 victory at Yankee Stadium.\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t second-guess going to our bullpen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pettitte, who never even hinted that Girardi made a mistake in removing him when he did.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Was it the fault of Shawn Kelley and Joba Chamberlain, who each gave up three-run homers in the inning? Or perhaps Boone Logan, who allowed two base runners to reach, as well, was at fault. Or maybe the blame goes to the Yankees offense, which is not looking quite as dangerous as it had in recent days.They all made contributions to what can best be described as unqualified disaster.The game was moving along swimmingly for the Yankees as it entered the seventh. They led, 3-0, after four, and Pettitte, while not dominating, was holding a workable lead.So when he sat down in the dugout after the top of the sixth on a humid afternoon at Yankee Stadium, the pitching coach Larry Rothschild checked in with him, asking if he was good to go out for the seventh.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Pettitte said he was.So that was the plan. Girardi and Rothschild would allow Pettitte to go out in the seventh. But he had already thrown 86 pitches, and with the humidity draping the Bronx in a sticky, soupy haze, the hook was close at hand.

But the pitch count was bothering Girardi, as was the way the previous two hitters had connected on their hits.

Hardy and Adam Jones homer in ...', "" For six innings, hope was lost. The season was over. The sweep was inevitable. The Orioles continued a scoreless streak for their offense after being shut out yesterday and they looked lifeless against Andy Pettitte. Wei-Yin Chen struggled, turning in another short outing. All that changed in the seventh inning, when Pettitte ran out of gas and Yankees manager Joe Girardi turned to a parade of ineffective relievers. Two three-run home runs later, one by J.J. Hardy and one by Adam Jones, and the Orioles stormed out to a 7-3 lead to avoid the sweep and keep their dim playoff hopes a little more alive for one more day. This was not a game that looked like a victory for the Orioles. As they have done in so many recent games, they brought poor hitting along with poor pitching. Chen only lasted four innings, giving up five walks and four hits. That he only allowed three earned runs is something close to a miracle. It was not pretty, but he did limit the damage and eventually the offense broke through. It was not to Chen's benefit, but the team got the win it needed. They finally broke open against Pettitte in the seventh inning. Pettitte had gone through six innings and only allowed five singles. The bats were flat. There was nothing happening. Then, abruptly, there was something. Newly-acquired Oriole Michael Morse led off with a single, his second hit of the day. Danny Valencia added another single. It's almost like there is something to the idea of stacking the lineup with right-handed hitters who hit well against lefties. That was the end for Pettitte and the reliever roulette began.    Unfortunately for Girardi and the Yankees, every reliever he summoned came up as a round in the chamber. Shawn Kelley came in to the game and gave up a single to Matt Wieters, scoring the O's first run. This might have seemed like a favorable match-up: Wieters batting left-handed is a struggle this year. No luck for Kelley. He then faced Hardy, who hit a fly ball to the opposite field that it looked like left fielder Curtis Granderson could catch at the fence. He jumped and the ball struck the very top of the fence.    This was the Yankee Stadium-est of Yankee Stadium home runs. It did not even make it into the seats. The ball rolled along the concrete wall. It still counts. The home run was Hardy's 24th of the season and it gave the Orioles a 4-3 lead at the time. After Kelley came Boone Logan, the lefty in the Yankees bullpen. Brian Roberts outsmarted the Yankees by laying a beautiful bunt down the third-base line. He advanced to second when Nick Markakis walked. Given what happens when Markakis swings the bat, this was the best-case scenario. The LOOGY was a NOOGY today, and Logan gave way to Joba Chamberlain, who some Yankee fans refer to as the human white flag.    The thing about Chamberlain is he sucks this year. It's hard to fathom why anyone would think it is a good idea to bring him into a one-run game with two men on base. Manny Machado, either on his own or at the behest of the O's bench, attempted to bail out the Yankees with a bunt. It was a horrible decision and executed terribly: he popped out foul to the catcher. Why have Machado bunt? Why? Lucky for the Orioles, Chamberlain was still involved prominently. He pitched to Jones. This, too, was a horrible decision. He made a mistake against a batter who will swing at anything and Jones did what he does to mistakes. He crushed the baseball to deep center field, 424 feet from home plate. This was Jones' 28th home run of the season and brought him up to 98 RBI for the year. It was the second Earl Weaver Special of the inning and gave the O's the 7-3 lead that held for a final score. Of the four Yankees pitchers to pitch in the seventh, the only one to record any outs was Chamberlain, who would go two innings and had only one run charged to him - Jones. With Chen chased early, the runs scored in support of Kevin Gausman, who pitched two innings in relief. He allowed a hit and a walk while striking out three, and showed plenty of flashes of why he is a top pitching prospect. Next he just has to do that as a starter instead of in relief. His change-up is a beautiful thing. He was credited with the win today, raising his record to 2-3. Kelley took the loss, dropping to 4-2. Francisco Rodriguez, Tommy Hunter, and Darren O'Day all followed with a scoreless inning each. Hunter allowed two hits and that was that. This was the first game all year that the Yankees lost at home when they led the game by at least two runs. They were up 3-0 thanks to a run-scoring single from Alfonso Soriano in the third inning, then a bases-loaded walk to Brett Gardner in the fourth inning that was followed by a sacrifice fly from Derek Jeter. The seven unanswered runs means they are now 32-1 in such games. With Sunday's win, the Orioles are back in the first chasing position among the wild card contenders who are not in a playoff spot. They sit 3.5 games back with Oakland and Tampa Bay's game in progress at press time. An Oakland win would put the Orioles three games back at the end of the day. This is not insurmountable, but it is not an easy road, either. They are a half-game ahead of both Cleveland - who they play next - and the Yankees. The Orioles travel to play the Indians on Monday, with a 4:05pm game on Labor Day. Bud Norris takes his act on the road for the O's, with Justin Masterson starting for Cleveland.

09/02/2013,"[('Series Preview: Baltimore Orioles @ Cleveland Indians, 2-4 ...', ' A pair of series losses later, the Orioles are somehow still in the Wild Card race, three games back of Tampa Bay. The Indians are just half a game behind the O\'s in that hunt, so while a break from the AL East, this series is not a break from contending teams. They basically need to be a game better than the Rays each week for the rest of the season; that doesn\'t sound that bad until you realize that if Tampa Bay averages a 4-3 record each week, the O\'s have to go 5-2. On to Cleveland! Monday, 2 September: Bud Norris vs. Justin Masterson    Career Numbers Norris vs. Indians Masterson vs. O\'s   IP - 63.0   ERA - 4.71   FIP - 3.41   Slash Line (Past Teams) - .255/.318/.370   Slash Line (Current Players) .174/.345/.217 .259/.312/.384     As a wise man once said, this deal is getting worse all the time. That may be a little harsh - Norris\'s peripherals suggest he\'s pitched better than his 4.91 ERA with the O\'s - but he hasn\'t lasted six innings or more for nearly a month. He\'s never faced the Indians, and has only seen Drew Stubbs for more than three plate appearances (.686 OPS, 17 PA). Masterson is having a good year, striking out just under a batter per inning and getting an absurdly high groundball rate (58%). He\'s also thrown three shutouts this year and has just three starts in which he\'s failed to go at least six innings. One day, the O\'s will have somebody like that on their staff. They did manage to rough up Masterson back on 25 June, though, when he imploded in the seventh inning and gave up homers to Chris Davis (yawn) and Alexi Casilla (Wait, what?).    Maybe hot: Alexi Casilla (1.010 OPS, 31 PA) Likely not: Nick Markakis (.410 OPS, 28 PA), Matt Wieters (.499 OPS, 23 PA)    Tuesday, 3 September: Chris Tillman vs. Ubaldo Jimenez    Career Numbers Tillman vs. Indians Jimenez vs. O\'s   IP 20.2 5.1   ERA 4.79 3.38   FIP 5.27 6.85   Slash Line (Past Teams) .265/.319/.458 .348/.400/.609   Slash Line (Current Players) .281/.338/.484 .241/.294/.443     Tillman played the stopper in Boston last week, giving up two runs over seven innings and helping the O\'s avoid being swept. His numbers against Cleveland aren\'t pretty, but he\'s only faced them four times, and two of those were bad starts back in 2009. Tillman faced Masterson in the game mentioned above, going seven innings and allowing only three runs despite walking four.    Jimenez is having his first solid year with the Indians, with his ERA, FIP, and xFIP all right around four. He walks a lot of batters (4.65 BB/9), but strikes out just over a batter per inning, so he often can get away with poor control. Jimenez doesn\'t get deep into games reliably, averaging 5.4 innings per start and having as many sub-five IP outings as over-six ones. He faced the O\'s back on 24 June, and despite allowing ten baserunners and two homers in 5.1 innings, managed to escape with just two runs allowed. Maybe hot: Nick Swisher (.929 OPS, 20 PA) Likely not: Nate McLouth (.360 OPS, 25 PA) Wednesday, 4 September: Miguel Gonzalez vs. Zach McAllister    Career Numbers Gonzalez vs. Indians McAllister vs. O\'s   IP 17.2 13.1   ERA 3.06 3.38   FIP 4.91 4.45   Slash Line (Past Teams) .286/.342/.543 .235/.250/.471   Slash Line (Current Players) .250/.376/.482 .225/.262/.400     Gonzalez is perhaps finally showing why Buck Showalter has talked a lot about trying to limit his innings, having had as many bad starts as good since the All-Star break. We all got a bit spoiled by his consistency in the first half of the year, and this regression is to be expected. But he\'s still turned out to be a great pickup by the O\'s front office - imagine the state of the rotation without him. Gonzalez has been a bit homer-prone in his limited action against Cleveland thus far, allowing four homers in 17.2 innings, but has also struck out nineteen batters in those appearances. McAllister has been having a pretty solid year, with a 3.81 ERA and a 3.82 FIP to match. Some of that success, however, appears to be a result of being a flyball pitcher (37.2 GB%) with a questionably low home run rate (6.3 HR/FB%). He\'s rarely dominant, with only one start this year in which he hasn\'t allowed at least one run, but he\'s rarely awful as well, with just three starts in which he\'s allowed more than three runs. He faced the O\'s a couple of times last year, with mixed results: three homers allowed in 13.1 IP, but twelve strikeouts and just five runs surrendered. I realize that people have feelings, and I don\'t enjoy hurting people\'s feelings when I have to take them out of a game. But just because a guy is bothered when he\'s lifted for a pinch hitter, it doesn\'t necessarily mean he\'s sensitive. When there are twenty-four players who think the manager should pinch-hit and one player who thinks the manager shouldn\'t, that one player is not looking at it realistically. A guy may be oh-for-twenty-two and his teammates may be saying, ""Boy, this guy is killing us,"" yet he\'s angry when the manager benches him. Now, is that being more sensitive or less intelligent? - Earl Weaver  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Yankees Roll Past the White Sox With an Eight-Run Fourth ...', '     Supported by    Baseball |                            Yankees 9, White Sox 1                                                             Yankees Roll Past the White Sox With an Eight-Run Fourth  By ZACH SCHONBRUNSEPT. 2, 2013    Continue reading the main story Share This Page  Continue reading the main story                if (             window.magnum             && window.magnum.getFlags().indexOf(\'headlineBalancer\') > 0             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.shouldRun()         ) {             window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize();         }         Photo       Vernon Wells, left, and Curtis Granderson both scored in the fourth inning.

The Yankees did not need the calendar or the cloud cover to remind them that the sun will quickly set on their season if they do not win games. But the reinforcement never hurts.Neither does an eight-run, error-aided inning, like the one that helped the Yankees to a runaway win over the last-place Chicago White Sox, 9-1, at Yankee Stadium on Monday. The Yankees welcomed the chance to coast to a drama-less victory, understanding that such opportunities will not come around often.\xe2\x80\x9cThis time of year you want to get some games like this,\xe2\x80\x9d Manager Joe Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can not use some guys in the bullpen and you can get some guys out a little bit early and maybe get them some rest. But you just want to keep tacking on runs, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what they did.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The outburst came in the fourth inning, after a rain delay of 1 hour 53 minutes in the second knocked out both starters, Phil Hughes for the Yankees and Jose Quintana for the White Sox. Quintana\xe2\x80\x99s replacement, Dylan Axelrod, imploded, allowing the first seven batters in the fourth to reach base. Mark Reynolds, Austin Romine, Brett Gardner, Derek Jeter and Alfonso Soriano drove in runs with base hits.

Credit             Seth Wenig/Associated Press           The Yankees added another run on an error by first baseman Adam Dunn, who threw a potential double-play ball into left field. By then, the score was 9-0, and White Sox Manager Robin Ventura looked understandably steamed.The cushion helped Yankees reliever David Huff, but he pitched as if he did not need it. As the delay eclipsed 90 minutes, Girardi tabbed Huff to replace Hughes \xe2\x80\x94 a move that would have been applauded in some fan circles if it had happened in the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 rotation.

But Girardi has steadfastly supported him, almost to a fault. He shuffled the rotation this weekend to allow Hughes to face Chicago, a team he has pitched well against throughout his career.

', 'www.nytimes.com'), ('Norris, Orioles Overpower Indians 7-2 \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' CLEVELAND (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Bud Norris stayed unbeaten as a starter with Baltimore and Nate McLouth homered and had three RBIs, leading the Orioles to a 7-2 win over the reeling Cleveland Indians on Monday night in a matchup of two teams scrapping for an AL wild-card berth. Norris (10-10) allowed one run \xe2\x80\x94 a homer to Jason Kipnis \xe2\x80\x94 and four hits in seven innings. The right-hander improved to 4-0 as a starter with the Orioles, who acquired him at the July 31 trading deadline from Houston. He lost once in relief. Matt Wieters hit a two-run homer in the ninth and Brian Roberts drove in two runs for the Orioles, who came in three games behind Oakland and Tampa Bay in the wild-card race. The Indians lost for the sixth time in seven games and could be without All-Star Justin Masterson (14-10) for the most important stretch of their season. Masterson left in the second with what the team said is \xe2\x80\x9csoreness\xe2\x80\x9d in his rib area. After dropping two of three in Boston and New York, the Orioles, who staggered through a 12-14 August, arrived in Cleveland needing to string some wins together. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew that schedule was going to be a challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Buck Showalter said before the game. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re .500 in our last 10 games. Is it half full or half empty?\xe2\x80\x9d Norris provided some more optimism, striking out eight and keeping his record unblemished in seven starts since joining Baltimore. He allowed just one hit through five innings, and picked Michael Brantley off second in the second. The Indians are sliding in the wrong direction. They went 1-5 on a trip to Atlanta and Detroit, only salvaging the finale Sunday thanks to a ninth-inning grand slam by Mike Aviles to beat the Tigers. Masterson initially showed discomfort while working to Wieters leading off the second. Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s top starter grimaced and flared his elbow at his side, a motion that sent Francona to the mound accompanied by a trainer. The right-hander stayed in the game, but after allowing a single to Wieters, he threw an 87 mph fastball to Nick Markakis and paused. Shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera went to check on his teammate and immediately waved toward the dugout, bringing Francona again. He took the ball from Masterson, who dejectedly walked off the field and then disgustedly tossed a cup of water in the dugout before heading to the clubhouse. The loss of Masterson for any amount of time would be a major blow to the Indians and their postseason chances. He\xe2\x80\x99s their unquestioned ace, leading the team in wins (14) and innings (190 1-3), and the 28-year-old is tied for the league lead with three shutouts. Preston Guilmet replaced Masterson and gave up a single to Markakis. With one out, McLouth hit an apparent RBI double to center. However, the Indians won an appeal that Markakis missed second base, and under rule 10.05, McLouth was not awarded a hit on the play because it was a forceout. After Guilmet walked No. 9 hitter Alexi Casilla, Roberts hit a two-run double to make it 3-0. McLouth\xe2\x80\x99s 10th homer put the Orioles ahead 5-0 in the fourth.\xc2\xa0 J.J. Hardy singled with one out before McLouth pulled a pitch from Nick Hagadone over the wall in right. Lonnie Chisenhall homered in the eighth off Tommy Hunter for Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s other run. NOTES: Indians RHP Corey Kluber, sidelined since Aug. 6 with a sprained middle finger, will pitch in relief Friday after Scott Kazmir starts against the Mets. Kluber pitched a simulated game Monday, and because he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t pitched in some time, the Indians want to be conservative with him. Also, the club is concerned about overworking Kazmir. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it has a chance to help us win, help both pitchers and help the bullpen,\xe2\x80\x9d Francona said. \xe2\x80\xa6 Orioles LHP Zach Britton was recalled from Triple-A Norfolk. He\xe2\x80\x99s 2-3 with a 4.76 ERA in six starts for Baltimore this season. Britton will be used in the bullpen for now. \xe2\x80\xa6 Indians OF Ryan Raburn is expected to be activated Tuesday after being sidelined with a pulled calf muscle. \xe2\x80\xa6 With his next homer, Hardy will become the fourth active shortstop and ninth since 1901 to record three or more seasons with 25 or more homers.

However, the Baltimore Orioles very much \xe2\x80\x9crolled into Cleveland\xe2\x80\x9d yesterday afternoon as they defeated the Cleveland Indians 7-2 at Progressive Field. The Orioles got a solid start from Bud Norris, who to this point hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had the ability to go so deep into games (all while pitching well). Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 7 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 8 K. Perhaps the most impressive part is that in striking out eight batters (that\xe2\x80\x99s a minimum of 24 pitches right there), Norris left the game after only 92 pitches.The Orioles appeared poised to touch up Cleveland starter Justin Masterson, however skipper Terry Francona and the team trainer came out to check on Masterson\xe2\x80\x99s health early in the second inning. Masterson somehow convinced them that he was fine, however a few pitches later they came out again, and this time Masterson left the game (with a sore rib cage). That was an early break for the Orioles, and Nate McLouth appeared to take advantage of it when his apparent RBI-single scored Matt Wieters and left two runners in scoring position. However Cleveland appealed to second base, and umpire Mike DiMuro called Nick Markakis out (ruling that he never touched second base). It\xe2\x80\x99s tough to say whether or not he touched the bag because it appeared that no camera caught Markakis running the bases, however upon Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x98s protest DiMuro was steadfast. So the play was ruled a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice-RBI for McLouth. Following a walk by Alexi Casilla, Brian Roberts cleared the bases with a two-RBI double to give the Birds a 3-0 lead.Previous to that play Nate McLouth had been mirred in a 1-for-16 slump, so just when it appeared he had busted out of it an official scorer in a visiting ballpark decided to take that hit away from him! However McLouth quickly busted out again, smacking a two-run homer to right center in the top of the fourth. The Orioles suddenly had a 5-0 lead in this first game of an all-important series. Cleveland would mount a bit of a rally in the seventh and eighth with solo homers by Kipnis and Chisenhall, however for the most part the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen shut them down. However just to be sure, Matt Wieters decided to add two more on with a two-run homer in the top of the ninth inning to give the Birds a 7-2 lead and thus a 7-2 victory on the shores of the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland.Courtesy of Ken Blaze-USA TODAY SportsFor what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, that was Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 20th home run of the season. For all the talk about Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 numbers being down at the plate earlier in the season, if your catcher is able to make it to twenty homers you\xe2\x80\x99re getting pretty good offensive production out of him. Obviously he isn\xe2\x80\x99t getting on base as often as last year, however he\xe2\x80\x99s still hitting-for-power. The Orioles will also get some reinforcements today, as Henry Urrutia, Jonathan Schoop, and Josh Stinson will all be given September call-ups today after Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s season abruptly ended this weekend. Ryan Flaherty will also be re-joining the O\xe2\x80\x99s, however that was already a given.The series continues tonight as the Birds send Chris Tillman to the mound, ironically in a situation where he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a stopper for once. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s lone poor start last season came at Progressive Field in Cleveland, however he rebounded in his next time out. Tillman will be opposed by Ubaldo Jimenez of Cleveland. The Orioles have now won three of their last five games. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
09/04/2013,"[('A Bright Spot in the Orioles Rotation: The Emergence of ...', 'Chris Tillman\xc2\xa0 Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsWith 25 games left in the 2013 MLB season, the Baltimore Orioles find themselves 3 games back from the second wild-card spot. August was a roller coaster of a month for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, from dominating the Padres and taking two games in San Fransisco, to getting swept by the Diamondbacks and losing two games in an important home-series against the Rays.They will need to improve off their August campaign in which they went 12-14 (.461 winning percentage) if they hope to grab one of the wild-card spots in the American League. The Orioles ability to score with runners in scoring position and the ability of the bullpen to preserve a lead are the main questions coming into this all important last month of regular-season baseball. Their success will be an integral part of the Orioles push for the playoffs but there has been one player in particular that has been reliable not only in the month of August, but the whole 2013 season. Chris Tillman has established himself as the Orioles go-to starting pitcher and has become the safest bet for a quality start in a rotation that has experienced a bumpy road heading into September baseball.In the second round of the 2006 MLB Draft, Chris Tillman was drafted at the age of 17 by the Seattle Mariners. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until February of 2009 that Tillman joined the Orioles in the trade that sent Tillman, along with Adam Jones, George Sherill, Kam Mickolio, and Tony Butler to Baltimore for starting pitcher Erik Bedard. Since his arrival in 2009, Tillman has recorded a record of 31-22 in the major league which is respectable winning percentage for a starting pitcher, but if we had looked at his record before this year it would be a different story. Before bursting onto the scene this year, Tillman had a 16-18 record in his four seasons with the Orioles. Tillman has since made major improvements in his game and this season,\xc2\xa0 it has showed. This season,\xc2\xa0 Tillman holds a 15-4 record with career highs in strikeouts (141), WAR (3.5), and innings pitched (167.0). If we take a closer look at Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s statistics on the mound, we find that Tillman is a consistent and reliable threat that has given the Orioles organization a bright spot in their starting rotation that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had really since Erik Bedard was still in Baltimore or even as far back as Mike MussinaThis year, Chris Tillman became the fastest player in an Orioles jersey to reach 15 wins since Erik Bedard and also made his first career all-star game. Tillman could have gotten there even faster if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken him 5 starts to get that elusive 15th win, one should also note that in four of those five starts, he only gave up a maximum of 2 earned runs in each start. Even in his win-drought, Tillman turned in quality start after quality start. Tillman has accumulated an 3.71 ERA with 144 strikeouts this year and the solid play doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop here. Batters are only hitting .239 when facing Tillman and has recorded the highest WPA (Wins Probability Added) rating of his career with 2.13.\xc2\xa0 Tillman also currently ranks 3rd in the MLB in LOB%(Percentage of Runners Left on Base) with 82.3% of runners left on base, behind only Yu Darvish and Julio Teheran. This means that when batters eventually reach base against Tillman, it is very unlikely that Tillman is going to let them cross the plate and score. If you combine this percentage with the best defensive team in the MLB, you get a tough outing for any team playing against Tillman and the Orioles.The Orioles should keep hold of Tillman as long as they can, in a shaky and many times confusing pitching rotation, the Orioles need some form of stability and Tillman provides that. With an excellent ratio of LOB% and numerous quality starts, Tillman has grabbed hold of the \xe2\x80\x9cace\xe2\x80\x9d position in this rotation and will continue to impress Buck Showalter and the rest of the Orioles organization as the Chase for October continues.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles @ Indians lineups - Wednesday night; Brian Roberts ...', "" Zach Britton has faced 1,090 batters in his big league career. The good news is that their collective slugging percentage against him (.404) is lower than that of what passes for an ace on the Orioles staff this year. Chris Tillman has allowed a .420 slugging percentage this year. The bad news is he walks so many hitters. The Indians send this lineup against him:  Indians lineup vs. O's: Bourn CF Swisher 1B Kipnis 2B Santana DH Gomes C Cabrera SS Raburn LF Aviles 3B Stubbs RF.

The big problem for Britton, courtesy of the Orioles game notes, is that he has a 2.70 ERA in the first five innings and a 20.25 ERA in the sixth inning on. It's almost as if, like so many O's starters before him, he has problems with his stuff getting through a batting order the third time.    Here are your Orioles facing off against Zach McAllister:     #Orioles 9/4 lineup vs #Indians: Roberts DH, Machado 5, Davis 3, Jones 8, Markakis 9, Wieters 2, McLouth 7, Hardy 6, Flaherty 4, Britton 1\r \xe2\x80\x94 Eduardo A. Encina (@EddieInTheYard) September 4, 2013    Wilson Betemit has faced McAllister nine times, is 3-7 with two walks, and is not in the lineup tonight. We should all be OK with this, because that was probably a healthier Betemit. He has seen McAllister more than any other Orioles player.    J.J. Hardy and Ryan Flaherty have each hit a home run off McAllister, who is right-handed. The O's lineup has several righties who hit right-handed pitchers better than left-handed pitchers, which may be a good sign. They need today to be a win. They've needed a lot of games to be wins that they've lost recently, so it's not worth much. But maybe this group can pull it off today. They need to get things rolling with a solid start from Britton, then the hitters need to maybe score some runs. It sounds so easy.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
09/05/2013,"[('Will Jim Johnson be on the Orioles in 2014? - Camden Chat', ' One of the more interesting stories of the Orioles\' 2012/2013 offseason -- which saw Dan Duquette largely bring the 2012 team back for another year -- was that of Mark Reynolds.  Reynolds was an enigma in 2012, with a bat that declined just a bit from his 2011 production, a complete defensive meltdown at third base and then finding an adequate home at first base.  Taking the entire season combined, Reynolds was essentially a replacement-level player in 2012 (0.2 WAR at Baseball Reference and -0.1 WAR at Fangraphs).  With 2013 being Reynolds\' final year of arbitration, which would lead to a big raise over the $7.5M he made in 2012, the Orioles chose to non-tender him rather than pick him up at a projected $13M or so, a decision most fans understood.  The team also, by all accounts, chose not to negotiate with him during their exclusive window, a decision that fans understood a bit less, and he ended up with the Indians on a $6M deal. The decision has looked good in retrospect, as Reynolds put up negative WAR in Cleveland before getting cut and picked up by the Yankees and salvaging some decent time in their bandbox of a park.  Still, cumulatively for 2013, Reynolds has once again been right around replacement level when you add up his power, patience, poor contact skills and lackluster defense. Looking at the Orioles\' current roster, they will once again head into next season with a lot of players getting pay bumps in arbitration, and probably a limit on payroll flexibility (even with $10M from Brian Roberts and $7M from Jason Hammel coming off the books).  And the one player who\'s starting to look the most like Mark Reynolds is the team\'s struggling closer, Jim Johnson. 2014 will be Johnson\'s final year of arbitration, and he\'s making $6.5M in 2013 while logging performance that\'s just a shade above replacement level (0.7 bWAR, 0.4 fWAR).  With his traditional stats looking a bit off from his peak last year, but still not terrible (3.45 ERA, 41 saves so far), it\'s reasonable to expect that he\'d get a healthy raise in arbitration.  The formulas that estimate arbitration salaries very well aren\'t in for this offseason yet, but I\'m assuming $8-9M for Johnson.    When you look at the Orioles\' frustrating 2013 so far, there\'s plenty of blame to go around for the team being on the outside looking in for an AL Wild Card slot, but to the extent that one player can shoulder the blame right now, Johnson\'s the guy.  Saves might be an overblown statistic, but a blown save is still a really bad thing when finishing a ballgame is your primary responsibility -- and Johnson has nine of them after blowing just three in 2012.  It\'s largely on Johnson that the 2013 club is 15-25 in one-run games, rather than near .500 as one might expect.  No matter how you slice it, if the Orioles had gotten last year\'s results out of Johnson, or had switched to another able closer sooner, they\'d probably be in the Wild Card picture right now.  He\'s having one of the best strikeout years of his career, but one of the worst years in walks, hits and home runs per nine innings.  His sinker has just looked flat and hittable during his lousy stretches, and a sinker that doesn\'t sink is a batting practice pitch much of the time. Even if Johnson goes back toward his career norms in 2014 (which is not unlikely, given the historical fickleness of relief pitcher performance from year to year), he\'s typically only been a 2-WAR player or so, depending on the system you use.  Looking at an $8M salary for Johnson next year gets pretty unpalatable through that lens. The team runs into a couple of problems, though, if it decides to go another way.  As much hate gets piled on the ""closer"" designation, let\'s just be honest: Every manager wants a closer, and the Orioles don\'t have an obvious one on the roster.  Tommy Hunter has had a very good season, but he\'s still homer-prone, and he\'s been really bad in back-to-back appearances all year (for which closers are often called upon).  Darren O\'Day is a pretty consistently good reliever, but his platoon splits to lefties are a big alarm bell right now; teams normally want a closer with relatively even splits.  Francisco Rodriguez is only in Baltimore as a rental player.  So, if the Orioles decide to cut ties with Johnson, that leaves them with the less-than-appealing options of picking up a closer in free agency (which likely wouldn\'t be all that much cheaper than sticking with Johnson) or hoping that an in-house option fluctuates into a shutdown season next year.    The other problem is one of perception.  Dan Duquette doesn\'t seem to stress this very much, but cutting or trading Jim Johnson would be taken by some fans as a sign that the team is ""selling"" or throwing in the towel on contending in 2014.  I\'m certain that the Orioles aren\'t viewing 2014 as a rebuilding year, but even a deserving cut like Reynolds was poorly received by much of the fanbase last offseason, so Duquette will have to offset any plan to move Johnson out of Baltimore with some equally important ""buyer"" moves. Nonetheless, if I had to break out my crystal ball, I think Johnson will get traded this offseason.  It\'s hard to say what his value will be on the trade market, but unlike Reynolds last year, he should still garner interest given his history as a closer, something teams are always hunting for.  If the Orioles can\'t find the right trade partner, though, I\'m not sure I can see them cutting Johnson like they did Reynolds.  Johnson has a much longer history of performance, and tenure as an Oriole, than Reynolds ever did.  I\'m not sure he\'s a guy the team will just non-tender if they can\'t work out something else.  Orioles fans could easily spend 2014 holding onto their butts whenever they hear ""The Pretender"" come on over the Camden Yards PA system, and the team might be spending even more for the privilege.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Zach attacked in Cleveland - Birds Watcher', 'The Baltimore Orioles are having a tough time putting everything together at one time. They did it on Monday in Cleveland fairly well; good offensive output and a good pitching performance. But that seems to be the exception as opposed to the rule. Last night Zach Britton set the tone early by giving up four runs in the first inning. Britton\xe2\x80\x99s line: 2.1 IP, 6 H, 4 R, 2 BB, 4 K. Most teams will find it tough to win if their starter can\xe2\x80\x99t get out of the third inning. After two infield singles and a walk, Britton had loaded the bases in the first inning with nobody out. A Yan Gomes RBI-single kept the bags juiced and gave Cleveland a 1-0 lead. Later in the inning Raburn hit a two-RBI double, and Astrubal Cabrera added an RBI-single; Cleveland led 4-0 after one.However to his credit, Britton settled down and sent Cleveland down 1-2-3 in the second. He was lifted with two runners on and one out in the third, in favor of Kevin Gausman. That in and of itself shows you the urgency of all these games given that it\xe2\x80\x99s doubtful that Showalter would have lifted his start in that situation in a game back in June or July. Several readers tweeted me regarding why Britton was in the game to begin with. I understand people\xe2\x80\x99s frustration, however the reason he was given the start is mainly due to the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s a lefty. Terry Francona had stacked the lineup with lefty hitters against right-handed Oriole pitching for two consecutive days (and when I say\xc2\xa0stacked\xc2\xa0I mean eight of the nine batters hit from the left side). Was Britton the southpaw that should have been out there? I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s debatable; however it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to criticize the line of thinking there.Courtesy of Denis Poroy/Getty ImagesThe Orioles did rally, which is a good sign moving forward. Adam Jones hit a solo home run in the\xc2\xa0fourth, and Manny Machado tied the game with a three-run homer in the fifth. So let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear; Zach Britton is not why the Orioles lost this game, as once Machado tied it with that home run it was a new ballgame. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to say\xc2\xa0if not for those four runs in the first\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0however I believe that Orioles fans are smarter than that. The\xc2\xa0all things being equal\xc2\xa0argument in sports is a tough one to make. Because you\xe2\x80\x99re assuming just that; all things are the same. Sure if you remove those four runs in the first and still assume that Jones and Machado hit their home runs, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have a 4-0 lead. Realistically I just don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to make that assumption.Gomes would add another RBI-double in the fifth, and Kevin Gausman would surrender another run on a wild pitch. The issue of course is that Cleveland was scoring their runs by manufacturing them, while the Birds are living vicariously through the long ball. That might be the biggest takeaway from this game and this series; the Orioles need to manufacture runs if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to remain in the race moving forward. Situational hitting will always help to win you games, but especially in September when you\xe2\x80\x99re fighting for a spot in the post season.The Orioles head home after a 3-6 road trip, however there\xe2\x80\x99s no use crying over spilled milk. There\xe2\x80\x99s still time to make up ground, and that quest has to start tonight. The Orioles open up a four-game set against the ChiSox at the yard this evening, and for the record this will be their last series outside of the AL East for this year. Miguel Gonzalez will take to the mound for the Orioles after a tough outing in New York last year. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Jose Quintana\xe2\x80\xa6another southpaw.

09/06/2013,"[('9/6: Birds Watcher- Orioles bounce back', 'With their 3-1 win last night over the ChiSox, the Baltimore Orioles were able to bounce back from their road trip blues. It certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t erase the memory of dropping two-of-three in Boston, New York, and Cleveland, however at this point every win becomes important. The Birds last night got what they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the two previous nights in Cleveland: solid starting pitching. Miguel Gonzalez struggled for one inning, although he got out of it only giving up one run. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 6 K. It all starts with pitching, and starting pitching at that. If you get solid starting pitching, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be in a much better position to win ballgames.Courtesy of USA TodayThe Orioles took an early 1-0 lead in the first inning when Adam Jones homered. The homer was Jones\xe2\x80\x99 30th of the season, and also his 100th RBI. The 100 RBI are a career-high for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 center fielder, who had been chasing the number for a few games. Chris Davis and Adam Jones are the first pair of O\xe2\x80\x99s to drive in 100 RBI since 2008 when Aubrey Huff and Melvin Mora did it. That in and of itself should give Orioles fans pause, and tell them how far the franchise has come.Gonzalez ran into trouble in the third inning when he loaded the bases with nobody out. De Aza was induced to ground into a double-play, which did allow a run. However you can look at that as a almost net-gain for the Orioles, as only one run was surrendered. Beckham, the final hitter, grounded out to end the inning, and the game went on as a tie.The Orioles busted the game open (so to speak) in the last of the fifth, when J.J. Hardy led off the inning with a homer, followed later in the inning by on off the bat of Brian Roberts. Save for a base hit here and there, Chicago failed to challenge the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead at any other point in the game. Jim Johnson came on to close out the ninth inning, retiring Chicago hitters in order to end the game.The hidden issue is that the Orioles are still only managing to score off of home runs \xe2\x80\x93 solo home runs at that. If the Orioles are going to remain in the playoff race, the\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to manufacture runs in games as opposed to relying on home runs. In this case one would think that solo homers wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt a team (Chicago or anyone else). However the difference last night was that the Orioles got good starting pitching. It\xe2\x80\x99s been obvious that the pitching can\xe2\x80\x99t be relied upon to be that way every game.The series continues tonight as Scott Feldman takes to the hill at the yard against the ChiSox. The Orioles will be looking to start another winning streak, and one longer than two games at that. Feldman will be opposed by Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s John Danks, who\xe2\x80\x99s currently 4-11 on the season.Game time is 7 PM tonight, live from Camden Yards. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
09/07/2013,"[(""Feldman with a complete game shutout in Orioles' victory"", 'In his last outing in New York, Scott Feldman pitched seven innings of one-run baseball and took the loss. Last night he became the first starter for the Baltimore Orioles since Jason Hammel in June of 2012 to pitch a complete game. Feldman\xe2\x80\x99s line: 9 IP, 5 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 3 K. Ultimately when you get pitching like the Birds did last night, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how few runs you score (as long as you put one up on the board) or how they come. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to lose. Feldman didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up a hit after the top of the 5th, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t yield a base runner after a walk that he issued in the top of the 7th. Ultimately neither of those runners came back to haunt him in the game; again, if you get pitching like that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to win.Danny Valencia, with whom I share the initials\xc2\xa0DV\xc2\xa0I might add \xe2\x80\x93 started the scoring off in the last of the third when he sent a solo homer out of Camden Yards to give the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 1-0 lead. As much as we talk about manufacturing runs, that was the 19th consecutive run that the Orioles had scored off of the long ball. However that streak ended in the fifth, when Valencia came to bat again with two out and J.J. Hardy on third. Valencia bounced a tight grounder down the third base line that was fielded cleanly, however Valencia legged out an infield single at first base. That scored Hardy, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s led 2-0.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-US PRESSWIRE \xe2\x80\x93 PresswireHowever it was the sixth inning when things snowballed on the ChiSox, and starter John Danks. The Birds added two more solo homers, one by Chris Davis and the other by Matt Wieters (back-to-back). Davis\xe2\x80\x99 shot was his major league-leading 48th on the season, bringing him to within two of Brady Anderson\xe2\x80\x98s team record of 50. Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 homer had barely cleared the fence when Chicago manager Robin Ventura emerged from the dugout to lift Danks and to go to the Chicago bullpen (which finished the game). And that in and of itself is possibly the biggest point in this game for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. While Chicago only used two relievers in the game after Danks, the O\xe2\x80\x99s used zero. They had two relievers throwing in the \xe2\x80\x98pen in the ninth inning just in case Feldman ran into any trouble, but he sent the ChiSox down 1-2-3 to end the game. So the Orioles go into this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game with a rested \xe2\x80\x98pen, which might even have a ripple effect down the line when the all-important series with New York begins on Monday.The win, combined with Tampa and New York losses has put the Orioles back into the top spot in terms of the chase for October. Tampa currently holds the final wild card spot, with the Orioles only two games behind. Just when you thought they were out, they get pulled back in!

But if one were an Orioles fan in the DC area today, one would be incorrect. You see, FOX picked up today\'s Orioles game for a national broadcast, but in most markets outside of Baltimore and Chicago, the actual FOX broadcast was the Yankees-Red Sox matchup.  In spite of this, FOX\'s broadcast of the game caused a national blackout for alternative means of viewing the game, such as MLB.TV.  This all means that, if you live in the US, but in an area where FOX was broadcasting Yankees-Red Sox, you had no legal means to watch today\'s game, even if you were willing to pay for the privilege, beyond your normal cable package. Policy changes going into effect in 2014 will improve this situation somewhat, though of course that provides no remedy for anyone who wanted to watch today\'s game, and couldn\'t do so.  Next year, at least, MLB.TV users will be able to watch nationally broadcast games that are not available over the air on their own local affiliate.  That\'s a partial fix, but it\'s incomplete. MLB needs to require that networks who purchase national rights to a game broadcast that game in the entire normal region of the teams playing.  That means FOX shouldn\'t be allowed to buy the rights to an Orioles game without broadcasting it on ALL of its local affiliates in Baltimore, DC, North Carolina and southern Pennsylvania.  If you can get MASN as part of your cable package, FOX should be required to provide you any games it picks up in MASN\'s place.    Going even further in the realm of fan-friendly policies, if MLB is going to sell national rights to multiple games to the same network (like FOX), it should require FOX to put whichever game isn\'t on FOX in a particular market on another channel, like FX or Fox Sports 1 (the same would apply for ESPN/ESPN2 or TBS/TNT).  Really, the first thought of the league and the networks alike should be, ""If paying customers want our product, how can we give it to them?""  Anything less might be more profitable in the very short term, but damages both entities in the long run. Again, it\'s 2013.  People rightly assume that if a video broadcast is available for a live sporting event, and they are paying for methods that would normally air it, they should be able to legally view it.  Today, sitting in my home less than 60 miles from Camden Yards, MLB, FOX and the Orioles combined to completely let me down in that regard.  The league, networks, franchises and advertisers might all assume that they are one another\'s customers, but the truth is that the fan is the ultimate customer for all of them.  The archaic, backward-looking blackout policies being run by all of these entities don\'t reflect this simple reality, and they need to be fixed.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

But the Yankees overcame Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s seventh blown save of the season to beat the Red Sox, 4-3, when Ichiro Suzuki scored on Brandon Workman\xe2\x80\x99s wild pitch in the bottom of the inning.So despite losing three of four to the Red Sox, despite having a weary pitching staff that allowed 34 runs in the first three games of the series and despite not having Derek Jeter in the lineup \xe2\x80\x94 the shortstop has soreness in his surgically repaired left ankle and is expected to miss several days \xe2\x80\x94 the Yankees remained two and a half games behind the Tampa Bay Rays. The Rays, who hold the second American League wild-card spot, won in Seattle on Sunday. But the Yankees closed to a half a game behind the Baltimore Orioles and the Cleveland Indians, two teams ahead of them in the wild-card race who both lost Sunday.

And when I say\xc2\xa0shamelessly, I mean that he uses words such as\xc2\xa0we\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0us\xc2\xa0to refer to the ChiSox. Big no-no in broadcast sports or in columns such as Birds Watcher. Nevertheless, one of Harrelson\xe2\x80\x99s other rituals is to refer to the ChiSox as\xc2\xa0the good guys. Quite honestly, that\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat tame in my book given that it\xe2\x80\x99s probably no different than Chuck Thompson saying\xc2\xa0ain\xe2\x80\x99t the beer cold!\xc2\xa0after an Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 win. However my point here is not to pick Hawk Harrelson apart per se, although I suppose nobody told him that the real \xe2\x80\x9cgood guys\xe2\x80\x9d bat last.The Baltimore Orioles got a decent start out of Wei-Yin Chen yesterday afternoon, although he was unable to leave the game with the lead. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 6 H, 2 R, 0 BB, 8 K. However keep in mind that one goal of a starting pitcher is to put his team in a position to win the game. Chen did that yesterday, rebounding from a couple of lackluster starts. The Birds took an early 1-0 lead in the last of the first when Chris Davis doubled Manny Machado home from first base. This could have been a game whereby we were talking again this morning about missed opportunities, because the only other hit the Birds got with a runner in scoring position wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until the 10th inning. At the end of the day, the Orioles went 2-for-18 with RISP, which is barely even noteworthy when you win (and when your opponent puts up a 1-for-6 spot).Chicago tied the score in the fourth inning when Paul Konerko sent an RBI-single up the middle. They would take the lead in the fifth when Dayan Viciedo hit a homer to center field, and suddenly the Birds trailed 2-1. However regardless of the struggles on the year, these Orioles are a resilient bunch; Brian Roberts led off the last of the inning by homering to left field on the first pitch. Suddenly we had a new ballgame once again, with the score tied at two. Incidentally, how often have we seen things in the last few weeks and said\xc2\xa0this is what happens when things aren\xe2\x80\x99t going well for you? While the O\xe2\x80\x99s have had their struggles (and yet have always managed to remain in the playoff race) they\xe2\x80\x99ve never struggled to the point that their opponent this weekend is struggling. Chicago has now lost nine straight games. So yes, when things aren\xe2\x80\x99t going well for you and you\xe2\x80\x99re struggling to that extent, your opponent manages to tie the game back up on the first pitch after you take the lead. Incidentally, that was merely a harbinger of what was to come.As the late innings wore on it became increasingly obvious that the game was destined to go to extra innings. Going back one night, this shows how important it was for Scott Feldman to have pitched a complete game on Friday. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pen was totally rested; in an extra inning game, that makes a huge difference. However it was actually the ChiSox that struck first, with Conor Gillaspie hitting a pinch-hit homer off of Tommy Hunter in the top of the 10th. So here\xe2\x80\x99s Chicago thinking that their eight-game losing streak is over; but what did was say above?\xc2\xa0Good guys bat last, right? Well, we said that also\xe2\x80\xa6but remember the part about what happens when things aren\xe2\x80\x99t going well for you?Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re the visiting team and you take the lead in extra innings, you do so knowing that you still have to play the first in the last of the inning since the home team gets it\xe2\x80\x99s last at-bat. With one out in the last of the 10th, Buck Showalter sent Henry Urrutia up as a pinch hitter for Alexi Casilla. Urrutia promptly got on with a base hit, and was then lifted for a pinch runner (Chris Dickerson). Nick Markakis singled to left field, and Dickerson went to third. Following a Markakis steal of second base (and a McLouth strike out), the O\xe2\x80\x99s had the winning run in scoring position. So when Matt Wieters singled to right field, both runners came home to score and the Orioles had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.With Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s loss last night, the Birds are now only one game out of the second wild card slot (tied with Cleveland). If the Orioles win today and Tampa ends up losing, the Birds and Tampa will finish the day tied for that spot. The Birds will send Bud Norris to the mound this afternoon as they look for the four-game sweep of the ChiSox, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Andre Rienzo. Baseball is the only sport that gives the advantage of the potential for a walk-off win to\xc2\xa0only\xc2\xa0the home team. So turning again to Mr. Harrelson, in this particular case the ChiSox aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily given the moniker of\xc2\xa0the good guys. Because as we all know, good guys bat last. ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('White Sox @ Orioles lineups and game preview - Camden Chat', "" It's game four of four in this series and the Orioles are going for the sweep. Four-game sweeps are very tough to do no matter which two teams are playing in them, but the Orioles have the upper hand. They won all three games started by lefties and now they get to face a right-handed rookie, Andre Rienzo. Rienzo is twenty-five years old and has made seven starts for the White Sox this year.

""We needed it, because we\'ve had some pretty tough games the last couple days.""Robinson Cano hit a two-run double and the Yankees, fighting for a wild-card berth, finally quieted Boston\'s booming bats behind starter Hiroki Kuroda. They took a one-run lead into the ninth inning before Rivera, called on to start the eighth, gave up a wind-aided homer to streaking Will Middlebrooks.Suzuki hit a one-out single off Workman (5-3) in the bottom half, stole second and advanced to third on Vernon Wells\' fly to right.Workman then fired a high pitch that deflected off the mitt of catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia and caromed away off the backstop, allowing Suzuki to score easily.""It just kind of got away from me,"" Workman said. ""We were trying to work a little bit up on him.""Boston, which began the day with the best record in the majors and an 8\xc2\xbd-game cushion in the AL East, had its five-game winning streak snapped. The Red Sox simply outslugged New York in the first three games of the series, giving them a whopping 54 runs, 17 homers and 64 hits during a four-game span that ended Saturday.Finally on Sunday, some pitching.After getting big hits from Cano and Mark Reynolds off Boston starter Jon Lester, the Yankees clung to a 3-2 lead through seven innings.With setup man David Robertson and left-hander Boone Logan sidelined by sore arms, the 43-year-old Rivera (5-2) was brought in to start the eighth for the first time since June 20, 2006, at Philadelphia.""He\'s not saving anything for 2014,"" Girardi said about Rivera, who plans to retire after this season. ""He told us that he could give us two, so it wasn\'t really too harsh.""Baseball\'s career saves leader got through his first inning with little difficulty, but Middlebrooks led off the ninth and lofted high fly to right field. Suzuki initially broke in on the ball, then scurried back as the wind caught hold of it and dropped it a few rows deep beyond the famous short porch at Yankee Stadium.""I thought he was going to catch it on the track,"" Middlebrooks said. ""I didn\'t crush it. I didn\'t think it was a homer.""But it was \xe2\x80\x94 the fourth for Middlebrooks in five days. Rivera, hands on his hips, stood on the mound with a puzzled, exasperated look on his face and appeared to mouth the word ""unbelievable.""It was Rivera\'s seventh blown save in 48 chances this year, and second of the series.""If it wasn\'t for the wind, it would have been a popup,"" Suzuki said through a translator.Rivera retired the next three batters, though, and the Yankees regrouped to finish a 6-4 homestand that keeps them in the wild-card hunt.Kuroda tossed six gritty innings and left in line for his first win since Aug. 12. Shawn Kelley retired Dustin Pedroia on a grounder with two runners in scoring position to end the seventh.It was Kelley\'s first outing since he was roughed up by Baltimore last Sunday. The right-hander had been sidelined because of inflammation in his triceps.After allowing 34 runs in the first three games of the series, the Yankees appeared to be in trouble again when Kuroda gave up consecutive doubles to David Ortiz and Mike Carp to start the second. But the right-hander fought through a 38-pitch inning and kept the score 1-0 by retiring Daniel Nava on a bases-loaded grounder following a pair of walks.Kuroda threw 92 pitches in the first four innings and 117 in all. Lester yielded three runs and 10 hits in eight effective innings.""I felt good. Little bit of a grinder for me,"" Lester said. ""But I was able to keep the team in reach.""New York tied it in the fourth. Alex Rodriguez singled and scored from first base when Reynolds doubled to deep center.Lester ran into some tough luck in the fifth. Chris Stewart blooped a one-out single to snap an 0-for-23 slump before Suzuki and Vernon Wells fisted soft singles that landed just out of the reach of shortstop Stephen Drew.That loaded the bases for Alfonso Soriano, who struck out. Cano then lined a two-run double over Middlebrooks at third to put the Yankees ahead 3-1.""Made one bad pitch in the inning and give up two runs. It\'s frustrating, but you\'ve just got to keep making pitches,"" Lester said.Ortiz hit a leadoff double in the sixth and scored on Saltalamacchia\'s RBI groundout.Stewart, hit by a pitch in the third, was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the sixth with a bruised left foot. He was sent for precautionary X-rays.NOTES: Boston\'s last four-game sweep of the Yankees came at Fenway Park in June 1990. The only time the Red Sox have swept a series of at least four games in the Bronx was a five-game whitewash in July 1939. \xe2\x80\xa6 Saltalamacchia (back) was back behind the plate after sitting out five games. \xe2\x80\xa6 RHP Clay Buchholz is set to rejoin the Red Sox rotation Tuesday night at Tampa Bay after missing three months with a strained neck.

09/09/2013,"[('Series Preview: Baltimore Orioles vs. New York Yankees, 9 ...', "" A week ago, the Orioles were three games back of Tampa Bay for the second Wild Card spot. Now, they're two games back. As much as there were some frustrating losses last week, progress is progress. This series begins the true home stretch of the season, as the remaining twenty games are all against divison opponents: four each vs. the Yankees and Rays, and six each against the Red Sox and Blue Jays. For better or worse, the teams the O's are most worried about are the two they play the least. This final O's-Yankees series of the season could have a big effect on the Wild Card race, as the Yankees are just half of a game behind the O's. Let's look at the matchups. Monday, 9 September: Chris Tillman vs. CC Sabathia    Career Numbers Tillman vs. Yankees Sabathia vs. O's   IP 40.0 203.0   ERA 7.43 3.33   FIP 4.95 3.44   Slash Line (Past Teams) .360/.423/.506 .245/.290/.366   Slash Line (Current Players) .336/.404/.546 .278/.314/.428     Tillman has, to put it midly, not been good against New York in the past. The most I can say about those numbers above is that that the FIP is significantly better than the ERA (but still bad), and forty innings is still a pretty small sample size. It's not like Chris has never had a good start against the Yankees, though; he was pretty bad against them in their last meeting (6 July, in the Bronx), but went six innings with two runs allowed in Baltimore on 30 June. Tillman battled some major control issues in his last outing, walking five in 5.1 innings against the Indians, and the team really needs him to bounce back for this start.    It's weird when you actually get a pitcher who has a full season's worth of innings against a team, but it's to be expected from a pitcher like Sabathia, especially now that he's on his fifth season in the AL East. Sabathia has really looked vulnerable this year; his ERA is currently 4.86, and while he's probably suffering from some bad luck (4.22 FIP, 3.71 xFIP), even the advanced metrics don't have him looking like an ace anymore. The O's have done well against him this season, too: he had one outstanding eight-inning outing in April, but has thrice since failed to record a quality start against Baltimore. Expect to see Michael Morse in the lineup; even though these small sample sizes really don't mean anything, he's four-for-seven with a homer against Sabathia.    Maybe hot: Robinson Cano (1.360 OPS, 24 PA), Lyle Overbay (1.387 OPS, 17 PA), Alexi Casilla (1.144 OPS, 32 PA) Likely not: Ichiro Suzuki (.250 OPS, 16 PA), Matt Wieters (.514 OPS, 42 PA)    Tuesday, 10 September: Miguel Gonzalez vs. Ivan Nova    Career Numbers Gonzalez vs. Yankees Nova vs. O's   IP 36.2 72.2   ERA 3.93 4.33   FIP 4.46 4.14   Slash Line (Past Teams) .221/.298/.382 .258/.310/.459   Slash Line (Current Players) .183/.258/.349 .270/.320/.466     I suppose it had to happen eventually. Gonzalez finally had a bad start against the Yankees on 30 August, giving up seven runs in four innings. That slash line against still looks pretty good, but the ERA is just okay now. With only one more off-day on the schedule, Buck Showalter won't be able to give Gonzalez extra rest as much as he might otherwise like. Hopefully Miguel's solid seven-inning, one-run start against the White Sox on the 5th is a sign of things to come. Nova doesn't have great career numbers against the O's, but he dominated them on 31 August, throwing a three-hit shutout. That's actually the second complete game he threw against the Orioles this year, the last coming on 5 July. In three starts against Baltimore this season, Nova's given up just four runs in 23.2 innings. He has, admittedly, been quite good in general this year, posting a 3.02 ERA and respectable saber stats (3.24 FIP, 3.63 xFIP), but perhaps the O's will finally do something about this disturbing trend. Maybe hot: Brett Gardner (1.010 OPS, 12 PA), Ichiro Suzuki (.982 OPS, 2 HR, 17 PA), Matt Wieters (1.500 OPS, 4 HR, 30 PA), Chris Davis (.994 OPS, 24 PA) Likely not: Curtis Granderson (.214 OPS, 14 PA), Robinson Cano (.311 OPS, 20 PA), Manny Machado (.182 OPS, 11 PA), Adam Jones (.531 OPS, 36 PA) Wednesday, 11 September: Scott Feldman vs. Andy Pettitte    Career Numbers Feldman vs. Yankees Pettitte vs. O's   IP 39.0 266.0   ERA 4.15 3.52   FIP 4.51 3.96   Slash Line (Past Teams) .305/.386/.455 .270/.330/.375   Slash Line (Current Players) .331/.407/.550 .265/.292/.371     Feldman's been on a bit of a roll lately, pitching a shutout in his last start and allowing two or fewer runs in his last five. He hasn't always gotten deep into games - two of those five starts have been less than six innings - but he's the kind of guy that most teams would be glad to have in the back of their rotations. That said, he hasn't pitched all that well against the Yankees historically, but his last start against them (on 31 August) was a seven-inning, one-run effort. Let's have a repeat of that, shall we? I don't know what's more annoying remarkable: the fact that Pettitte is still pitching, or the fact that he's still decent, with a 4.03 ERA this season. He's another guy with a long history against the O's who's done quite well against them, but like Sabathia, those numbers are buoyed by years in which he was a significantly better pitcher. Pettitte has, however, given the Yankees five straight quality starts, including one against the O's on 1 September. Maybe hot: Curtis Granderson (1.714 OPS, 18 PA), Vernon Wells (1.683 OPS, 18 PA), Michael Morse (.899 OPS, 11 PA) Likely not: Ichiro Suzuki (.597 OPS, 44 PA), J.J. Hardy (.394 OPS, 26 PA) Thursday, 12 September: Wei-Yin Chen vs. David Huff    Career Numbers Chen vs. Yankees Huff vs. O's   IP 34.0 8.2   ERA 5.29 0.00   FIP 5.54 2.63   Slash Line (Past Teams) .240/.308/.442 .167/.219/.167   Slash Line (Current Players) .273/.336/.495 .287/.350/.389     Chen pitched well against the White Sox on the 7th (6 IP, 2 R), but had a couple of poor outings against the Yankees and Red Sox in his two prior starts (total: 7.2 IP, 11 R). He's still having a decent year overall, with a 3.82 ERA (4.05 FIP, 4.32 xFIP), but his extreme flyball tendencies are always worrisome, and they become even moreso when he's pitching in AL East ballparks. Huff was with Cleveland until earlier this year, when the Yankees claimed him off of waivers. He was a starter from 2009 to 2012, but threw fewer and fewer innings each year and has mostly been a reliever this season. His first start this year, in fact, was on 7 September, and he gave up nine runs in 3.1 innings to the Red Sox. That doesn't sound terribly intimidating, but Huff is left-handed. In seventeen years of managing the Orioles, I don't believe I issued more than a few fines. ...Anyone who has a player on his team who must be fined before he plays ball doesn't have a very good player. He isn't a good player if he doesn't want to come to the park or if he doesn't want to play the game right or follow instructions. - Earl Weaver  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('After Managers Clash, Orioles Get a Key Win Against ...', '     Supported by    Baseball |                            Orioles 4, Yankees 2                                                             After Managers Clash, Orioles Get a Key Win Against Yankees  By DAVID WALDSTEINSEPT. 9, 2013    Continue reading the main story Share This Page  Continue reading the main story                if (             window.magnum             && window.magnum.getFlags().indexOf(\'headlineBalancer\') > 0             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize             && window.magnum.headlineBalancer.shouldRun()         ) {             window.magnum.headlineBalancer.initialize();         }         Photo       The umpires separated Joe Girardi and Buck Showalter, who got into a shouting match in the first inning.

For a moment, anything was possible: a discussion, an argument, a fight. But before the incident could escalate into something more, Showalter was restrained by two umpires and the managers returned to their respective corners.It was only the first inning.Tensions were high at Camden Yards on Monday night as the Yankees and Baltimore Orioles began a critical four-game series with a potential playoff berth at stake. Showalter and Girardi, two fiery managers, both with Yankee roots, never came to blows in a dispute that centered around Girardi\xe2\x80\x99s accusations that Bobby Dickerson, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 third-base coach, was stealing signs or pitch locations. But the teams exchanged punches and jabs until the Orioles emerged with a 4-2 victory that enhanced their playoff chances at the expense of the stumbling Yankees.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re two competitive, good teams and we\xe2\x80\x99re fighting for the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d a much calmer Showalter said after the game, \xe2\x80\x9cso there\xe2\x80\x99s a small margin for error.\xe2\x80\x9dAlex Rodriguez, batting second for the first since 2006, hit a home run in the first inning and Lyle Overbay hit one in the eighth. But in between the Orioles scored four runs against C. C. Sabathia, who did well to last into the eighth inning on a night when the bullpen needed rest. Baltimore starter Chris Tillman, however, was better, pitching seven solid innings to improve to 16-5, good enough to put a smile back on Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s face. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      If Showalter was visibly enraged, it was Dickerson who was the first to take umbrage with Girardi\xe2\x80\x99s behavior. In the bottom of the first Girardi ran to the other side of the dugout from where he normally stands and began yelling at Dickerson. Although Girardi would say only that he was protecting his players from something he saw, Dickerson revealed Girardi\xe2\x80\x99s intent.

I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to let him yell at me. I just said, \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even know me, to be yelling at me.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9dAfter Nick Markakis scored in the bottom of the first to even the score, 1-1, he went into the dugout and informed Showalter that Girardi was yelling at Dickerson. When the inning ended, Dickerson started yelling back at Girardi. Showalter told Dickerson to get into the dugout, then joined the battle himself.Girardi came out of the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 dugout for a confrontation that was headed for somewhere behind home plate, and Showalter \xe2\x80\x94 while being restrained by Ed Hickox, the home-plate umpire; and Jim Joyce, the first-base umpire and crew chief \xe2\x80\x94 could be seen pointing his index finger, yelling, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not right, Joe. That\xe2\x80\x99s not right,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as a few expletives.

Related Coverage           Jeter Is Gauged Daily, but Days Are Few SEPT. 9, 2013                       ', 'www.nytimes.com'), ('Orioles 4, Yankees 2: Tillman pitches seven innings ...', "" The Baltimore Orioles sent staff ace Chris Tillman to the mound tonight against the Yankees and he didn't disappoint. Two runs allowed in seven innings was good enough for the Orioles, who manufactured(!) four runs without the benefit of a home run. Anyone who has watched Tillman pitch knows that he's prone to giving up homers, and that's what he did again tonight. Thankfully, as if often the case with him, they were solo shots. The first to homer was the second batter of the night, Alex Rodriguez. It gave the Yankees a lead that didn't last long. After the home run by Rodriguez, Tillman shut down the Yankee hitters over the next six innings. He allowed two baserunners in innings two through seven, both singles. He struck out the side swinging in the seventh. He came back to start the eighth inning and immediately gave up his second home run of the night, this one to Lyle Overbay. Buck Showalter was ready, though, and pulled Tillman right after that. With Tillman shutting down the the Yankees, the Orioles got to work on CC Sabathia. Nick Markakis, who was inexplicably hitting leadoff, started the bottom of the first with an automatic double. It was the start of a three-hit night for Nick, so I guess Buck knows more than we do (or he just got lucky). With a runner on second, Manny Machado bunted Nick over to third. I don't know that I liked that play, but there's no disputing that it set up the first O's run of the game when Adam Jones hit a fly ball out to center field. Markakis tagged and slid in ahead of the tag with the tying run. The score remained tied until the fifth inning when the Orioles scored two more. The second run of the game looked a lot like the first. J.J. Hardy was the first batter of the inning and he lined a double down the left field line. Hardy moved to third on a piece of nice baserunning. Mike Morse hit a ground ball to third base and A-Rod checked Hardy back to second before throwing to first for the out. The second he let go of the ball, though, Hardy took off and slid in safely. He then came in to score on a sac fly by Matt Wieters. So the Orioles still weren't hitting with runners in scoring position, but they were knocking in runs. Baby steps, I suppose.    The next batter was Sabathia's arch-nemesis, Alexi Casilla. Casilla singled on a ground ball between the third baseman and shortstop, then stole second base. Markakis was at the plate and he came through again. He singled up the middle and Casilla came in with the third O's run of the game.    The bottom of the seventh inning looked like it might be big for the Orioles, but they had to settle for just one final run. Wieters walked and then Casilla hit a ground ball back to Sabathia. He fired to second but threw wide and Wieters was safe. Markakis' magic ran out, though, and he did hit into a double play. Manny picked him up, though, with his 49th double of the season off of the scoreboard. Wieters scored easily but Machado was stranded when Adam Jones struck out. After Tillman gave up a home run to Overbay to start the eighth inning, Showalter immediately went to the bullpen and brought in Tommy Hunter. Hunter wasn't messing around as he struck out the side. That just left the ninth inning for the Orioles to get through to secure the win. Even though Jim Johnson has looked a lot better of late, it can still be a little nerve wracking when he comes into the game.    Johnson was scheduled to face Alex Rodriguez, Robinson Cano, and Alfonso Soriano. No worries, right? It looked like JJ had his sinker working, but that didn't stop Rodriguez from smoking a pitch back up the middle for a single. There wasn't any time to get worked up over it, though, because Cano hit the first pitch to Hardy for an easy double play...until Casilla threw the ball away. Pretty much the only thing Casilla is good at is defense, so you hate to see that. Soriano also hit a ground ball, but the ball was hit too slowly and he beat out the relay. With two outs, Curtis Granderson stepped to the plate. He worked the count full before sending a fly ball to center field. It was hit hard enough to make us all hold our breath, but Jones settled under it on the warning track and got it for the final out. O's win! They are now 1 1/2 games ahead of the Yankees and with the Rays off today, they are just 1 1/2 behind them for the second wild card spot. Unfortunately the Indians also won tonight so they remain tied with the O's.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Close but no cigar - Birds Watcher', 'The Baltimore Orioles had every opportunity to sweep the ChiSox yesterday, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the cards. Admittedly it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to win games when you go 0-for-11 with runners in scoring position, but yet the O\xe2\x80\x99s did have a golden chance to win in the last of the ninth. More on that later however; starter Bud Norris battled a few command issues, as well as what appeared to be a slightly inconsistent strike zone. However the bottom line is that he was unable to put the team in a direct position to win the game. Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 4.1 IP, 9 H, 4 R, 1 BB, 6 K.As I said, Norris battled some command issues but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t totally ineffective either. However Chicago took a 1-0 lead in the second inning on a Viciedo RBI-double that scored Conor Gillaspie. Later in the game in the top of the fourth the ChiSox loaded the bases, only to come away with only one run on a De Aza infield RBI-single. However the Orioles had a bit of fight left in them after Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game. Adam Jones led off the last of the fourth with a solo homer, and the Birds were to within 2-1. However Adam Dunn hit a two-run shot in the top of the fifth onto Eutaw St, which put the Birds down by three at 4-1.With that said it certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a waste, because Dickerson (and his blazing speed) was put in motion immediately. On the next pitch Brian Roberts fouled out to the second baseman in foul territory for the second out. However Dickerson of course had attempted to steal second base, and was frozen on the base paths. At first Chicago seemed as confused as the Orioles, however all they had to do was throw the ball to first base and Dickerson was out (thus ending the game).A lot of Orioles fans were complaining about this play, however in fairness to Dickerson he was just trying to get into scoring position. Granted he didn\xe2\x80\x99t really make any effort to get back to first and he probably misread the ball, he was only caught in no-man\xe2\x80\x99s land because he had attempted to steal. However that aside, let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that the Birds took three-of-four in this series. The last memory of the series might not be pleasant all-around for Orioles fans, however losing that game can\xe2\x80\x99t overshadow winning three-of-four. Ultimately the O\xe2\x80\x99s are two games better than they were when the series started.The Orioles will play in the division for the rest of the way at this point, starting tonight with the New York Yankees coming to town for four games. The O\xe2\x80\x99s will have to face C.C. Sabathia right off the bat, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll counter with Chris Tillman. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

He is free on bail, essentially, appealing his 211-game drug suspension, and his line-drive doubles helped spark a 7-5 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday at Camden Yards.\xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m explosive,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodriguez said. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I have an opportunity to hit the ball and drive it to all fields.\xe2\x80\x9dAlas, Rodriguez is not the most reliable player to depend on for a playoff push. With his surgically repaired hips, his documented history of performance-enhancing drug use and his age \xe2\x80\x94 38 \xe2\x80\x94 he is a risky bet to hold up very long.So it was that Rodriguez doubled to start a go-ahead, four-run rally in the top of the eighth inning, and then was replaced in the bottom of the inning by David Adams. He said he felt a knot in his left hamstring coming around third to score, but iced it and said it \xe2\x80\x9cchecked out O.K.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Manager Joe Girardi said he would probably use Rodriguez as the designated hitter Wednesday.\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to keep him in there,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said, \xe2\x80\x9cso we\xe2\x80\x99ll figure something out.\xe2\x80\x9d Photo       Orioles Manager Buck Showalter, center with his back to the camera, confronted Joe Girardi on Monday over an accusation of tipping pitches.  Credit             Luis M. Alvarez/Associated Press           Rodriguez went 2 for 4 on Tuesday with a run batted in and a run scored, improving his average to .301 in 31 games. Small sample, maybe, but as a hitter, Rodriguez looks a lot better than an average or slightly above-average third baseman, which was General Manager Brian Cashman\xe2\x80\x99s stated expectation.Rodriguez has been playing, while Derek Jeter sits with soreness in his rebuilt left ankle. The Yankees traded for Seattle shortstop Brendan Ryan after the game, adding more depth to a depleted left side of the infield.

But Rodriguez has that look again, showing flashes of being one of the greats his career numbers say he is \xe2\x80\x94 however he did it.

Since then, no player in the majors has hit more home runs.

With the punch that we have, you feel you can come back now.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Yankees did their punching with their bats Tuesday; nothing spilled over from Monday\xe2\x80\x99s clash of managers, when the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Buck Showalter confronted Girardi for barking at the Baltimore third-base coach, whom Girardi suspected of telegraphing pitches to hitters.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to challenge Girardi \xe2\x80\x94 he was restrained by the umpires \xe2\x80\x94 should have surprised no one. Having spent so many years in their organization, Showalter acutely understands the importance of the Yankees, to his players and the fans, symbolically and, of course, in the standings.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s two very competitive groups that are competing for the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be. It matters. You care, it matters, like a lot of things in life. You\xe2\x80\x99re not very passionate about things you don\xe2\x80\x99t care about.\xe2\x80\x9dFor all the noise generated last month by some Boston Red Sox, who said Rodriguez should not be playing while he appeals his suspension, Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s objections had little traction. In comments he later said he never intended for publication, Showalter told USA Today that the suspension was too harsh because it could give the Yankees a temporary escape hatch from his bloated contract.

But the point was that the Yankees should suffer from the bad deal they made with Rodriguez.  On Tuesday, that deal helped the Yankees win a game they badly needed. They gained on every team they trailed for the second American League wild-card spot, and now stand just two games behind Tampa Bay and a half-game behind Baltimore and Cleveland.Rodriguez will have a big say in the outcome, as long as his body cooperates. The Yankees and their fans can thank the appeal process for that.

They may not win every game but their rejuvenated offense, led by the prolific Alfonso Soriano, is capable of rectifying any scoring imbalance with a barrage of hits and runs.Such was the case Tuesday when the Yankees wiped out a three-run deficit to beat the Baltimore Orioles, 7-5, at Camden Yards and vault their way back into contention for the second American League wild-card spot.Mariano Rivera got the final four outs for his 42nd save, matching his uniform number, and his first save since blowing two in a row against Boston last week. But now the Red Sox are the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 ally. They shut out Tampa Bay, 2-0, as the Yankees drew to two games behind the Rays and within a half game of the Orioles and the Indians.However, it was a costly victory. Already without Derek Jeter, who missed his third straight game with a sore left ankle, the Yankees had three more players leave the game with injuries.

He professed optimism that he would at least be able to be the designated hitter Wednesday.

Nova said he has been dealing with the problem for several starts, but had not revealed it to anyone because he wanted to keep pitching. He, too, hopes to be on the mound again in five days for his next start.And, finally, catcher Austin Romine took a foul tip off the mask in the eighth and most likely has a concussion, Manager Joe Girardi said. Romine initially remained in the game but after one batter started to feel nauseated, according to Girardi, so he came out and was expected to have tests done for what could potentially be a season-ending injury.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new,\xe2\x80\x9d Rivera said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been in this situation before, basically the whole year and we have to win and find a way to get it done.

09/11/2013,"[('What will the Orioles franchise home run record mean \\u2026', ' Chris Davis finished the 2012 season, and started the 2013 season, on a massive tear.  His offensive numbers were so gaudy for a while there that people were legitimately wondering if Chris Davis would challenge Roger Maris\'s AL record of 61 home runs.  Since the All-Star Break (and some would say more pointedly, since the Home Run Derby), Davis\'s pace has slowed quite a bit, and as a result I\'m going to lead off with two assumptions:  First, that Davis will not dethrone Maris, and second, that Davis will unseat Brady Anderson, who currently holds the Orioles franchise home run mark (50 home runs in 1996). Anderson, of course, set that franchise mark during an insane 1996 season so good that it has led to unsubstantiated whispers about so-called ""performance-enhancing drugs"" (anabolic steroids) that have dogged Anderson ever since.  Whether any of that\'s true or not, we\'ll never know, and I prefer to avoid aspersions in the absence of meaningful evidence.  Either way, Anderson had a massive season where he OPSed 1.034 and hit those 50 dingers, breaking Frank Robinson\'s franchise mark of 49, which had been set in 1966. The interesting thing about Anderson\'s season is that he\'s been remembered for that home run mark.  Brady was a good -- but not great -- ballplayer who did some things very well, others less well, didn\'t have the best longevity but had a pretty impressive peak.  And the peak of that peak was an incredible offensive season with lots of great numbers, but just one historic mark, that franchise record for home runs.  And so a mostly unremarkable mid-1990s outfielder, who might otherwise have been a faint but pleasant memory by now, has been remembered for quite some time simply for surpassing that one mark. Which brings us to Chris Davis.  Davis has always had a ton of raw power, but his career has been through peaks and valleys as he\'s struggled with contact and patience, all of which eventually led to his trade from Texas to Baltimore in 2011.  Since the end of the 2012 season, a switch has seemed to flip, with Davis showing better contact and patience, allowing his power to come through naturally against major-league pitching.  He\'s hit home runs to left field, right field and center; he\'s hit line drive homers and outrageous moonshots onto Eutaw Street; he\'s hit them in hitters\' parks and pitchers\' parks alike. What Orioles fans don\'t know yet is whether they\'re witnessing a new beginning for Davis -- a late bloomer coming to life -- or an Anderson-like burst of production.  I certainly hope it\'s the former, of course, but the great thing if Davis finishes 2013 with 51 or more home runs is that, in at least one respect, it won\'t matter.    A franchise record in a ""big"" statistic like home runs, strikeouts, wins or hits is the kind of stat that doesn\'t get much national attention (unless the franchise in question is the Yankees), but can instantly sear a player\'s name into the collective memories of fans.  A real fan can tell you about their team\'s franchise record holders, even if they can\'t name a single one for another team.  I still remember being at the game where Erik Bedard broke Mike Mussina\'s single-season Orioles strikeout record in 2007.  It was a meaningless game against the Twins in a lost season, but the team drew a decent crowd, handed out little orange ""K"" signs, and the moment that Bedard whiffed his 219th batter, the crowd went wild.  When Chris Davis hits #51, the moment will be even more electric, because home runs are the most prototypical of all baseball records. And even if (god forbid) Davis\'s career ends up more like Anderson\'s than a Hall of Famer\'s, once he hits #51, he\'ll etch himself a place in Orioles lore for a long time to come.  If there are 25,000 people in the stadium when #51 goes over the wall, 50,000 people will be talking about how they saw it happen (but I swear, I really was there for Bedard\'s mark).  People who take home Davis\'s bobblehead at the end of the month will associate it with the mark and keep it as a piece of team memorabilia that\'s just a bit more worthwhile than their Brian Matusz and Nolan Reimold figurines from recent years.  The Crush Davis t-shirts from May will be worn with pride around the mid-Atlantic until the paint fades off. A franchise mark isn\'t a league mark or a full-blown record, but it\'s something special for a team\'s fans to share with one another.  In the midst of a 2013 season that has simultaneously exceeded naysayer expectations and frustrated fans with missed opportunities at every turn, a big shared milestone for the Orioles\' collective memory will be a big positive takeaway.  It\'s not a pennant flag, and it doesn\'t make up for everything that\'s gone wrong, but maybe it\'ll do.

New York has hit eight home runs in winning two of three in the four-game series that concludes Thursday night.""That what you ask for,"" manager Joe Girardi said. ""We have to continue to play well.""Before the game, the Yankees announced that Jeter would miss the rest of the season with an injured left ankle. The Yankees captain played in only 17 games this season and made four trips to the disabled list.Once it became official that Jeter was lost, the team lamented his bad luck and got back to the business of earning another playoff berth.""This group fights,"" Girardi said. ""They\'re continuing to fight.""MORE: Jeter out for seasonSORIANO\'S POWER SURGE: \'I\'m having fun\'New York tailed 4-1 on Tuesday before rallying to win. In this one, Baltimore led 3-1 before Granderson homered in the fifth \xe2\x80\x94 New York\'s first hit \xe2\x80\x94 and Rodriguez tied it in the sixth with his 653rd career home run.In the ninth, after Cano connected off Tommy Hunter (4-4), Granderson tripled with one out and scored on an infield hit by Lyle Overbay.""We get down tonight and come back again,"" Girardi said. ""We were able to take the lead in the ninth. We get a huge homer by Robbie and then a huge hit by Lyle that winds up being a lot bigger.""David Robertson (5-1) worked the eighth and Mariano Rivera gave up a run-scoring single to Brian Roberts before securing his 43rd save, tied for the major league lead with Baltimore\'s Jim Johnson.Jeter\'s trip to the DL coincided with the arrival of shortstop Brendan Ryan, obtained one night earlier in a trade with Seattle. Although Ryan went hitless, he performed flawlessly and showed good range in the field.Each team has won nine games this year. The series winner will be determined Thursday night.""We play this team so evenly, it\'s unbelievable,"" Girardi said.Orioles slugger Chris Davis drove in two runs with a double, making him the first player in team history to have 40 doubles and 40 homers in a season. Danny Valencia tied a career high with four hits, and Roberts had three singles.Baltimore outhit New York 13-6, but lost a valuable chance to close in on Tampa Bay for the second and final AL wild-card spot.""We control our own destiny, we control our situation,"" Orioles center fielder Adam Jones said. ""The rest of the way we\'re playing against teams that are in the same situation as us, so we\'ve got to play better baseball. That\'s the cool part. We\'ve just got to play a little bit better.""Yankees starter Andy Pettitte gave up three runs and nine hits over 6 1-3 innings. The 41-year-old lefty has made 13 straight starts since September 2007 against Baltimore without losing, going 8-0 over that stretch. Pettitte has lost only twice to the Orioles since 2002 and is 28-6 lifetime against them.Pettitte has pitched at least six innings in each of his last six starts and is 3-0 in seven outings since Aug. 5.""It was a great game for us,"" Pettite said. ""The bullpen came in and obviously did a great job. There were some big hits for us. It was a good win, that\'s for sure.""Baltimore\'s Scott Feldman allowed only three hits in 7 2-3 innings, two of them homers. The right-hander struck out six and walked two. His first walk came against the first batter of the game and the second was to the last batter he faced.New York got a first-inning run when leadoff hitter Brett Gardner walked, stole second and scored on two groundouts.The Orioles took a 2-1 lead in the third. Roberts and Manny Machado singled with two outs before Davis lined a two-run double through the shift into right-field.Doubles by Valencia and J.J. Hardy made it 3-1 in the fourth, but Baltimore stranded runners at the corners.NOTES: New York\'s David Huff squares off against Wei-Yin Chin in a duel of left-handers in the series finale Thursday night. ... Pettitte has held the opposition scoreless in the first inning over six straight starts after allowing at least one first-inning run in eight consecutive games before that. ...

As if on cue, a stadium attendant opened the clubhouse door, and Pearce rode into the inner sanctum aboard his motorized skateboard.Seconds later, the attendant yanked the door back open to admit reliever Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day, who had trailed Pearce in the tunnel, standing erect atop a unicycle-like contraption.That scene took place in June, as O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Pearce and the rest of the Baltimore Orioles prepared to play the Detroit Tigers. Two months later, O\xe2\x80\x99Day was still at it, but Pearce could enter the clubhouse only by striding, not riding. His 800-watt EMAD Dirt Rider skateboard had gone on the disabled list, its belt having snapped. A few days later, Pearce went on the D.L., too, as his left-wrist tendinitis flared up again.This season has been a bumpier experience for all of the Orioles in comparison with the joy ride of 2012, when Baltimore made it to the postseason for the first time since 1997. In August, the Orioles went an underwhelming 6-9 during a 15-game stretch against the Tampa Bay Rays, the Oakland Athletics, the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees and the Cleveland Indians \xe2\x80\x94 all direct competitors for postseason berths. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Orioles could not hold onto late-game leads against the Yankees, and O\xe2\x80\x99Day, a solid reliever all season, could not even get into either game because of numbness and pain in two of the fingers on his pitching hand. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      He will not accompany the Orioles when they travel to Toronto for a weekend series, although he could rejoin the team at a later point on its trip.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  So maybe the wheels are starting to fall off for the Orioles in their bid to grab a wild-card spot for the second straight year. O\xe2\x80\x99Day may still be riding his contraption, and Chris Dickerson, back from the minors, is still riding his bike to the ballpark, helping to \xe2\x80\x9creduce my carbon footprint,\xe2\x80\x9d and Joe Hogarty, the team\xe2\x80\x99s strength coach, is pedaling around, too. But all that extracurricular exercise cannot disguise the fact that the Orioles are short on good pitching.Pearce may return shortly, but unfortunately, he is not a pitcher. A part-time left fielder and designated hitter who is hitting .241 this season in 108 at-bats, he previously missed six weeks because of tendinitis in both wrists, a consequence of overzealousness in the batting cage, said the team\xe2\x80\x99s hitting coach, Jim Presley.As for his skateboard, its girth has made it plenty durable, and its motor can easily power Pearce up the tunnel\xe2\x80\x99s ramp to the street after games, but Pearce figured that his 215 pounds eventually eroded the belt\xe2\x80\x99s capacity. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate it not working,\xe2\x80\x9d Pearce said. O\xe2\x80\x99Day feels the same about his battery-powered apparatus, called a Solowheel, which is designed without a seat or even pedals.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  During a recent trip to New York, O\xe2\x80\x99Day did not try to commute aboard his cycle from Midtown to Yankee Stadium. But Boston and Cleveland were accessible for O\xe2\x80\x99Day, a late-inning specialist with a sidearm delivery. He has a 5-3 record and a 2.28 earned run average in 63 games but has pitched only twice this month.

Privacy Policy    When he has been healthy, O\xe2\x80\x99Day, who finished the 2012 season with an E.R.A. identical to the one he has now, has proved to be a lot more consistent than his team this year. Through Wednesday, the Orioles were only 16-26 in one-run games after going a remarkable 29-9 in such contests in 2012. They can hit lots of home runs and field pretty well, but pitching, for the most part, has been another matter. While they led the major leagues in saves (49) through Wednesday, they also had the fourth-most blown saves (23).  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  That is the kind of thing that can have a team going in circles instead of straight ahead but, then again, these are the Orioles, with any number of players wheeling around in recent years.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  There is, of course, O\xe2\x80\x99Day, who used to Solowheel to most home games a year ago, but now, living farther away, he drives to the stadium, parks and then takes a brief, uplifting unicycle ride to the clubhouse, saving the bigger trips for the road. There is Pearce, and until he was traded to the Cubs in July there was Jake Arrieta, a starting pitcher who was a skateboard aficionado as well. The team\xe2\x80\x99s closer, Jim Johnson, bicycled to work last year, but this season, similar to O\xe2\x80\x99Day, he lives too far away to do so.And back in 2008, a bicycling group included the outfielder Nick Markakis and some players no longer with the team: pitcher Jeremy Guthrie, outfielder-first baseman Luke Scott and infielder Aubrey Huff.That cluster prompted the Orioles to install a bicycle rack next to their locker room, although nowadays, the rack goes unused by all but Dickerson and Hogarty.But the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 wheels remain conversation starters. O\xe2\x80\x99Day has let teammates test drive his Solowheel in the clubhouse. And as Pearce discussed his vehicle of choice not long ago, he piqued the interest of infielder Danny Valencia, who opened his laptop to investigate models and prices online.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s contagious,\xe2\x80\x9d Pearce said.

To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably a lot of the same of what he\xe2\x80\x99s been dealing with, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just part of being a pitcher.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Nova is 8-4 with a 3.17 earned run average and is the only Yankees starter who is more than one game over .500.

He acknowledged Thursday that he was concerned after the recent discomfort forced him to leave Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s game against the Orioles after the sixth inning.\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe last thing I want is to get hurt, especially this time of year.

Both runners moved up a base when Curtis Granderson, who had previously homered, laid down a sacrifice bunt, and Ryan scored on a wild pitch by Johnson.\xe2\x80\x9cThe guys made me look good and we won a game on a bases-empty single,\xe2\x80\x9d Ryan said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe got down a couple of bunts.

More specifically, it was his pending suspension for PED\xe2\x80\x99s. For starters, I was a bit surprised to hear MASN analysts Gary Thorne and Jim Palmer saying that ARod wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be playing right now had the league not tried to go jugular on his suspension. However the more I think about it they do in a way have a point. Instead, ARod has the opportunity to make himself into the victim in that he\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0technically\xc2\xa0never tested positive for PED\xe2\x80\x99s (in a test that \xe2\x80\x9ccounted\xe2\x80\x9d anyways), and thus he\xe2\x80\x99s not being treated fairly under the collective bargaining agreement. The Orioles were the team that was made to pay for that\xe2\x80\xa6this past week at least.That aside for a moment, each and every one of these PED situations is different. You have some people who might have rehabilitated an injury with a banned product here and there, and some guys who were more deliberate and severe users (this is where ARod would probably fall in). I applaud MLB for trying to universally render justice as blindly as possible. (I also agree that ARod\xc2\xa0should\xc2\xa0be treated more severely, given the misleading and equivocal nature of his comments about PED\xe2\x80\x99s, and the pure sliminess with which he\xe2\x80\x99s come across.) However are we becoming so caught up in the process that we\xe2\x80\x99re inadvertently falling behind in the fight against PED\xe2\x80\x99s?Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsRyan Braun got off on a technicality in the testing process when a courier kept his specimen over the weekend. Alex Rodriguez is presumably going to tie up his case in litigation \xe2\x80\x93 which mind you could shake the very foundation of the game \xe2\x80\x93 because he\xe2\x80\x99s not being treated fairly. (And bear in mind that on paper he is probably being treated unfairly\xe2\x80\xa6but it boils down to the rights of the individual over the better of the group or in this case the sport.) All of this is due to baseball being so obsessed with the process. And for the record, I agree with the process so to speak\xe2\x80\xa6but again, is it worth the hassle if it\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately causing more heartache in the sport?So am I proposing that MLB should scrap drug testing and allow anyone to use anything. Unequivocally, the answer to that question is a resounding\xc2\xa0NO!\xc2\xa0However, this is a huge problem in baseball as well as in other sports. I would submit that it\xe2\x80\x99s a much bigger and wider problem than we\xe2\x80\x99re even able to grasp. So I propose that in the immediacy of the coming off season, MLB should effectively give it\xe2\x80\x99s players a temporary pass on PED\xe2\x80\x99s. Basically, any player that\xe2\x80\x99s ever used a PED at any point in their professional career would be able to come forward and admit it\xe2\x80\xa6without fear of MLB holding them accountable in any way. (I suppose players could be asked to pay a small fine in the form of a charitable donation or something along those lines, but no wide scale discipline.)Why am I suggesting this? Because I would give this \xe2\x80\x9cgrace period\xe2\x80\x9d up until the beginning of spring training, 2014. After that point if any player is found to be using PED\xe2\x80\x99s, or were using PED\xe2\x80\x99s at\xc2\xa0any point\xc2\xa0in the past (that was not disclosed during the grace period), they\xe2\x80\x99d be subject to punishment. This would allow the Ryan Brauns and Alex Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s of the world their opportunity to in effect skirt the system. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that they should be allowed to skirt the system, but they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it anyways. And when MLB\xe2\x80\x99s trying to hold them accountable, the league itself is falling victim to it\xe2\x80\x99s own process and rules. Of course if something like this were to go into affect you\xe2\x80\x99d have the likes of Ryan Braun in court suing the league to get the game checks he would have collected while suspended, but you get the point.I agree with MLB suspending players for these transgressions, and furthermore I agree with things such as Braun getting a harsher suspension for\xc2\xa0being rude to the courier. (And as I said at the time, make no mistake about the fact that MLB used that as an excuse to give Braun a harsher penalty after he grandstanded when he got off the first time around.) However when the \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d is turned upside down and the guilty party is actually coming across as the innocent, the process ceases to be effective.I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that giving people a pass for doing the wrong thing is a great idea. However it might be the only uniformly \xe2\x80\x9cfair\xe2\x80\x9d way to bring the guilty to justice. If someone was found to have done PED\xe2\x80\x99s and they had been given six months to come clean (and chose not to), there\xe2\x80\x99d be very little wiggle room for them.

', 'birdswatcher.com'), (""Orioles 5, Yankees 6: Jim Johnson's terrible game ruins ..."", ' For one inning only, it was 2012 again. A three-run home run by Danny Valencia provided a game-tying punch in the bottom of the eighth inning, with a probably-injured David Robertson being on the wrong end of the box score in Baltimore in September again. The ninth inning started and it became 2013 again. Jim Johnson took the mound, threw the Orioles\' playoff hopes into center field and then into the dirt, and the Yankees finished off the series with a 6-5 victory. Both Cleveland and Tampa Bay were winners on Thursday night, meaning that the Orioles have four teams to pass to secure a wild card spot with 16 games to play. They are only 2.5 games back of the Rays, but there is a lot that has to go their way. The whole night was a very 2013 Orioles enterprise, with starter Wei-Yin Chen giving up bloops and blasts as the Orioles hitters managed minimal damage against surprise starter Phil Hughes, who was yanked after one batter in the fourth inning, and long relief man David Huff, each of whom pitched three innings. Former Oriole Mark Reynolds opened up the game\'s scoring with a two-run home run in the second inning. The Orioles give up home runs like they\'re going out of style. There was no exception to that tonight. Chen got in trouble again in the third inning, walking two batters and giving up a double to Alex Rodriguez to load the bases before Vernon Wells hit a two-run single, putting the O\'s in a 4-0 hole that it looked like would be enough to bury them for the night.    The O\'s got on board in the bottom half of the inning, helped in large part by Hughes throwing a wild pitch that advanced Matt Wieters (single) into scoring position, where Manny Machado brought him home. That was the only run they scored off Hughes, who was pulled after Eduardo Nunez committed an error to allow Adam Jones to reach in the fourth. Huff finished off the Orioles in the inning.    That would do it for scoring for both teams until the seventh inning. Chen came out to start the inning having already thrown 102 pitches. We all know how this ends already. He retired catcher Chris Stewart quickly and then gave up a bomb to Curtis Granderson. This has been a pattern all year for Buck. He brings out the starter for seemingly no reason for one extra inning and it ends in a home run. The only surprising thing is that Chen didn\'t walk Stewart before giving up the home run. On the night, Chen went 6.1 innings, giving up five runs, all earned, on seven hits and two walks. He struck out eight batters. Josh Stinson pitched 1.2 scoreless innings of relief.    Even Nick Markakis got in on the home run party, somehow muscling (?) a pitch from Huff to right in the seventh. It was not a cheap home run. He now has ten home runs on the season, which is disappointing, but with how he\'s been hitting lately, that he even has ten feels like almost a pleasant surprise. I take back using the word pleasant. Nothing about the outcome is pleasant tonight. At the time, all that it felt like was that Markakis hitting the home run would put the game in Mariano Rivera territory. The O\'s were behind 5-2. Against Robertson, they struck in the eighth. Machado nearly led off the inning with a home run. Both the MASN cameraman and announcer Gary Thorne seemed to think the moonshot was going to land in the upper deck, but instead it came down about a row into the left field seats. At least, that\'s what the ball would have done if it wasn\'t for an excellent leaping catch by Alfonso Soriano to rob him of a home run. It was deflating, but only for a minute, as Jones, Markakis, and Valencia combined for a furious two-out rally to tie the game. Robertson probably had no business pitching in the game, as he has been battling shoulder tendonitis. Then Johnson came on and went ahead and deflated the stadium again. He gave up a leadoff single to Brendan Ryan, who is one of the worst-hitting regular players ever. Again, we all know how this goes. Stewart laid down a terrible bunt that went right back to Johnson and at the very least should have retired the lead runner. Johnson threw the ball into center field, giving first-and-second and none out for the Yankees. Granderson, always a home run threat, came up and offered a bunt of his own, advancing two men into scoring position with one out and Alex Rodriguez coming to the plate. What could possibly go wrong? How about a wild pitch to bring in the winning run? Wieters had no chance to get in front of the pitch. Ryan scored. The Yankees took a 6-5 lead, the score by which they would win the game. Unsurprisingly, the Orioles went 1-2-3 with no solid contact whatsoever against Rivera in the ninth. They presented him with a bronze sculpture of a baseball bat breaking with a pitch before the game and presented him with a win at the end of the game. At press time, Rivera has been awarded the win, raising his record to 6-2 on the year, with Robertson getting no credit under the ""brief and ineffective"" rule. According to Roch Kubatko, the Yankees PR director was having a conversation with the official scorer about the decision, presumably because the Yankees want Rivera to get saves, rather than wins. Johnson undoubtedly deserves the loss, falling to 3-8 on the season. Take away half of Johnson\'s losses and the Orioles are 1.5 games up on the Rays. Closers are fickle, except for the legendary Rivera. Change a lot of things about the season and the Orioles could be doing better, if not dominating. Instead, they are what they are, which is good, but not good enough for the playoffs. The Orioles now head to Toronto, where it probably won\'t matter what they do as far as the playoffs are concerned. They open a three-game series at 7:07 on Friday night. Jason Hammel will be starting for the Orioles, with Todd Redmond starting for the Blue Jays.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""Orioles 5, Blue Jays 3: Chris Davis hits 50th homer in O's ..."", "" After a loss like last night's, it's hard not to feel like the Orioles are out of the playoff picture. They like to do just enough to keep hope alive, though, and they did just that with a nice come-from-behind win tonight. For what seems (but probably isn't) the first time in ages, the bullpen didn't give up any runs, despite being called upon for four innings after Jason Hammel's abbreviated outing. The offense got a few clutch hits, too, plus one big home run from Chris Davis. Nate McLouth singled to right to lead off the game, but Jays starter Todd Redmond retired the next three Orioles, stranding him. Jose Reyes led off the Jays' turn at the plate by doubling to right-center, but attempted to stretch it into a triple. With none out, Jays manager John Gibbons was no doubt unhappy about Reyes's decision, as Adam Jones made a tremendous throw for the out at third, and Jason Hammel retired the next two batters. The game was pretty quiet through the top of the fourth, as Redmond retired every Oriole he faced except Nick Markakis, who singled in the second and was hit by a pitch in the fourth. Hammel pitched pretty well, too, but got some help from his defense in the third: Moises Sierra hit a line drive right at Nate McLouth, and Manny Machado made a great play on J.P. Arencibia's sharp grounder down the third base line. In the bottom of the fourth, Jason Hammel got two quick outs before walking Edwin Encarnacion. All too predictably, he then gave up a first-pitch home run to Adam Lind, giving the Jays a 2-0 lead. Hammel then surrendered another homer in the fifth, to leadoff batter Colby Rasmus, and the game was feeling pretty hopeless at this point, as the Orioles went down in order in both the fifth and sixth innings. Despite Hammel's reasonable pitch count, Buck turned to Kevin Gausman in the sixth, who retired the side in order with a couple of groundouts and a strikeout.    Adam Jones got the seventh inning off to a good start with a double to right field. After Nick Markakis grounded out to second, moving Jones over to third, John Gibbons called in Dustin McGowan to pitch to J.J. Hardy. Hardy responded by driving in the O's first run with a double to left field. Ryan Flaherty then drew a walk, putting runners on first and second with one out for Danny Valencia, who couldn't replicate last night's heroics and popped out to first. Steve Clevenger, though, decided to make his first game as an Oriole memorable, hitting a two-out line drive to right field. Even better, the ball bounced over Moises Sierra's head, allowing not only Hardy but Flaherty to score, tying the game and giving Clevenger a double. Nate McLouth drew a walk, putting two men on and ending McGowan's night, but Sergio Santos struck out Manny Machado to end the inning.    In the bottom of the seventh, T.J. McFarland came on in place of Kevin Gausman, and was only able to record one out before giving up a pair of singles to Brett Lawrie and Colby Rasmus. Buck Showalter then turned to Tommy Hunter, who struck out Moises Sierra and J.P. Arencibia on seven pitches total, escaping the first-and-third, one out jam. Chris Davis led off the eighth inning against Steve Delabar with his fiftieth home run of the year, tying Brady Anderson for the Orioles' record for homers in a season (and benefiting from a generous two-strike check-swing call on the pitch prior). Adam Jones followed with an infield single, and after Markakis and Hardy made outs, Ryan Flaherty walked, bringing up Danny Valencia. This time, he came through, driving in Adam Jones with a line-drive single to center and giving the O's an insurance run.    With the score now 5-3, Tommy Hunter stayed on to pitch the eighth. He gave up a leadoff single to Anthony Gose before retiring the next three batters. Nate McLouth singled up the middle against Darren Oliver to start the ninth, but Oliver retired the next two Orioles. Adam Jones then singled, but Nick Markakis struck out, stranding both runners. Jim Johnson, last night's goat, gave up a leadoff single to Orioles' nemesis Adam Lind, but then caught a line drive up the middle by Brett Lawrie and doubled up Lind before striking out Colby Rasmus to seal the victory. O's win, 5-3. As of this writing, the Yankees and Royals have lost, but the Rays and Indians have won, so the O's are still behind all of those teams except the Royals and are 2.5 games back of the Rays.

(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Nathan Denette)MoreTORONTO (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Chris Davis made his milestone moment matter to the wild card-chasing Orioles.Davis hit his major league-leading 50th home run, a tiebreaking solo shot in the eighth inning, and Baltimore erased a 3-0 deficit to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-3 on Friday night, snapping a three-game losing streak.""It\'s nice to have personal goals and to reach your own goals but when the team is winning and you are successful, it makes it that much sweeter,"" Davis said. ""It was big to come from behind and get the win.""Orioles manager Buck Showalter said he was happy to see Davis to reach the mark in such meaningful fashion.""Everybody pulls so hard for him because he\'s such a good teammate, and so humble about the good things that he\'s had happen to him this year,"" Showalter said. ""He\'s just an easy guy to pull for.""Davis became the 27th major leaguer to join the 50-homer club, and the first since Jose Bautista in 2010, when he led off the eighth with a blast to center off All-Star reliever Steve Delabar, connecting on a 2-2 pitch.""I knew I barreled it up,"" Davis said. ""I tried to go the other way there with two strikes. I\'ve faced Steve a few times. You can\'t look for his split, as hard as he throws. I was just trying to put a good swing on it and stay through it.""The drive matched Brady Anderson\'s 1996 Orioles record and made Davis just the third player in major league history with 50 homers and 40 doubles in the same season. The others were Babe Ruth (1921) and Albert Belle (1995).""It\'s a humbling feeling to be in the same company with the guys I\'m in,"" Davis said.Davis has hit seven home runs off Blue Jays pitching this season and has 15 against Toronto since the start of the 2012 season, the most by any opponent.""He\'s having a great year,"" Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.

He doesn\'t get any cheapies.""Orioles fan Steve Houff of Ellicott City, Md., was in the center field seats with four friends, close to where Davis\' homer landed.Houff said he paid around $100 to buy the ball from the Toronto fan who caught it, giving it to Davis in exchange for a signed bat, signed balls for his group, several photographs and the promise of free tickets for the remainder of the weekend from a grateful Orioles staffer.Adam Jones followed Davis\' blast with an infield hit and, two outs later, moved up on Ryan Flaherty\'s walk before scoring on Danny Valencia\'s RBI single.Tommy Hunter (5-4) worked 1 2-3 innings for the win and Jim Johnson finished for his 44th save in 53 chances, rebounding after his wild pitch helped the New York Yankees beat Baltimore 6-5 on Thursday.Hunter, who was Davis\' teammate in Texas before both players were traded to the Orioles in 2011, said he marvels as much as anyone at his good friend\'s superb season.""I\'ve seen him hit multiple home runs in multiple games,"" Hunter said.

', 'www.yahoo.com'), (""Orioles 3, Blue Jays 4: Chris Tillman's lone bad inning ..."", "" A strong outing by Chris Tillman became marred by the first two batters of the seventh inning. He walked a batter on four pitches and then gave up a first-pitch home run to Colby Rasmus, turning a one-run lead for the Orioles into a one-run deficit to the Blue Jays. He pitched a full eight innings for the complete game loss, with the O's falling, 4-3, in Saturday afternoon's contest in Toronto. The loss means the Orioles could potentially end up 3.5 games back of the wild card with only 14 games to play, depending on the Rays result in Minnesota. Their latest one-run loss means they are now 16-28 in one-run games this season, which gives you a greater appreciation of how amazing last season's 29-9 mark really was. There was little clutch hitting to be found today, with the O's going 2-11 with runners in scoring position, leaving eight men stranded in the game. The eight men left on base includes two times where a runner reached third with less than two outs and could not be driven in. Tillman's outing is one that looks worse in the box score than it actually was. The four runs hurt, but he only allowed eight baserunners in as many innings, and two of those were not his fault. A Jose Reyes double in the first inning and an Anthony Gose triple in the second inning were both balls that should have been corralled by Chris Davis. The double by Reyes turning into an out should have meant that the first inning ended before Moises Sierra (I don't know either) could drive in two runs.    The Orioles actually struck first in the game, with back-to-back doubles in the top of the first by Manny Machado, his 50th of the year, and Davis. The Orioles home run leader sliced a ball to the opposite field that Gose dove for but could not come up with, driving in Machado and giving the Orioles a short-lived 1-0 lead. That was Davis' 130th RBI of the season, putting him three behind Miguel Cabrera for the American League lead.    Machado continued being awesome in the third inning, tying the game with a solo home run. That was his 14th home run of the season and his 1,337th (approximate) multi-hit game of the season. As good as we all thought Matt Wieters was going to be, Machado is actually that. Speaking of Wieters, he had one of those two hits that drove in a run, singling in Nick Markakis (two walks on the day) in the fourth inning. This gave the Orioles a 3-2 lead that for a while looked like it might hold, until Tillman's abrupt transformation for two batters in the seventh. Wieters looked terrible other than that, striking out three times, including two of the times the O's had a man reach third. On the season, he is batting .230/.285/.411, a .696 OPS that punches us all in some delicate places.    With that theme of terrible slash lines in mind, another culprit for failing with runners in scoring position today was Markakis, who went 0-2 to go along with his two walks. Both of his at-bats came with a man in scoring position. He lined out to second base in the first inning and grounded out to shortstop in the sixth. His season slash line is .271/.326/.361 and I am tired of pointing out how much it sucks. The O's struck Esmil Rogers for three runs in six innings, with five hits and two walks to go against seven strikeouts. They were held scoreless in the last three innings by a parade of Toronto relievers that included Jeremy Jeffress (1 IP), Aaron Loup (0.2 IP), Neil Wagner (0.1 IP), Casey Janssen (1 IP). Because the Jays went ahead in the seventh inning, after Jeffress had pitched, he was given the win, his first of the season. Janssen was credited with his 30th save. Tillman took the loss for the O's, dropping to 16-6. He only lost it for two batters, but with the way the O's have been performing with men in scoring position lately, losing it for two batters is too much. The Rays play the Twins. The Indians play the White Sox. The Rangers are imploding, possibly opening up another spot, but the O's aren't winning enough games for that to matter. They are not mathematically eliminated yet, but it will only take a combination of 13 Rays wins or Orioles losses to eliminate them, and they still have to pass the Yankees and Indians. For a team that has never gotten hot and looks like it never will get hot, that is a tall order. The finale of the series comes on Sunday afternoon with a 1:07 start time, with Miguel Gonzalez starting for the Orioles against Mark Buehrle of the Blue Jays.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('In A.L.

They\xe2\x80\x99ve done it a lot more times than they haven\xe2\x80\x99t. It just gets magnified at this time of year.\xe2\x80\x9d The Orioles stranded eight runners, four of them at third base. They\xe2\x80\x99re batting .221 (36 for 163) with runners in scoring position in their past 21 games. \xe2\x80\x9cWe got a couple of timely hits but not enough today,\xe2\x80\x9d catcher Matt Wieters said. Baltimore, which came in 2 1/2 games behind Tampa Bay in the race for the second AL wild-card berth, failed to take advantage of the rival New York Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 loss at Boston earlier in the day. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to make the playoffs, it sure isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles outfielder Nate McLouth said. \xe2\x80\x9cDoing it last year was kind of an eye-opener on exactly how it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be done. It\xe2\x80\x99s a grind, it\xe2\x80\x99s a battle to make the playoffs.\xe2\x80\x9d With just 14 games remaining, Showalter said his players don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be told what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had urgency all year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t some different dial we have to go to. Our guys get it.\xe2\x80\x9d Rasmus erased Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 3-2 lead by hammering a changeup from Chris Tillman (16-6) off the facing of the second deck in the seventh inning. For Rasmus, it was his 20th homer of the season and second in two days. \xe2\x80\x9cHe looks good,\xe2\x80\x9d Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always happen when you\xe2\x80\x99re out for that long and you don\xe2\x80\x99t get a whole lot of work in.\xe2\x80\x9d After missing more than a month with a strained muscle in his left side, Rasmus was activated off the 15-day disabled list before Friday\xe2\x80\x99s game, hitting a solo homer off Jason Hammel in Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 5-3 win. Rasmus\xe2\x80\x99 long ball Saturday made the Blue Jays the first team in the majors this season with at least five 20-homer players. Edwin Encarnacion (36), Jose Bautista (28), J.P. Arencibia (20) and Adam Lind (20) are the others. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy about it for sure,\xe2\x80\x9d Rasmus said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt feels good to hit 20 home runs.\xe2\x80\x9d The decisive homer was the 30th allowed by Tillman (16-6) this season. Only Oakland\xe2\x80\x99s A.J. Griffin (34) and Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s R.A. Dickey (31) have surrendered more. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a terrible pitch,\xe2\x80\x9d Wieters said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt probably could have been maybe a little bit lower and he might have gotten a groundball off of it. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to give credit to (Rasmus) because he kept it fair. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough pitch to keep fair when you\xe2\x80\x99re a little bit out front. When he hit it, I thought it was going to hook foul for sure but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles slugger Chris Davis, who hit his 50th home run Friday, finished 1 for 4 with a double. Jeffress (1-0) pitched one scoreless inning of relief to win for the first time since April 5, 2011, when he beat the Chicago White Sox while pitching for Kansas City. Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Aaron Loup got two outs in the eighth and Neil Wagner got the third, striking out Matt Wieters to strand runners at the corners. Casey Janssen finished for his 30th save in 32 chances as the Blue Jays snapped a four-game losing streak Tillman allowed four runs and six hits in eight innings to lose for the first time since Aug. 19, ending a five-start unbeaten run. The right-hander, who walked two and struck out four in his first career complete game, also failed to become Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s first 17-game winner since Mike Mussina in 1999. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was solid, just got a couple of changeups up,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a big pitch for him all year. Just elevated a couple and they made him pay for it.\xe2\x80\x9d Back-to-back doubles by Manny Machado and Davis gave the Orioles a lead in the first, snapping Blue Jays starter Esmil Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 scoreless innings streak at 15. Toronto answered in the bottom half when Moises Sierra hit a two-out, two-run double. Nick Markakis and J.J. Hardy drew back-to-back walks in the fourth and Wieters followed with an RBI single. Gose hit a two-out triple in the second, but Jose Reyes flied out to end the inning. That was the first of eight straight outs by Tillman, a streak that ended when Gose singled in the fifth. Gose was later caught trying to steal second. Brett Lawrie hit a leadoff single in the sixth but was erased on a double play. But Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s luck ran out after he walked Sierra to begin the seventh, with Rasmus homering on the very next pitch. \xe2\x80\x9cI made a mistake and he put a good swing on it,\xe2\x80\x9d Tillman said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be better there. It\xe2\x80\x99s a big mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d Rogers allowed three runs and five hits in six innings. He walked two and matched his career high with seven strikeouts. NOTES: Baltimore is 16-28 in one-run games this season. They went 29-9 in one-run games in 2012. \xe2\x80\xa6 Machado\xe2\x80\x99s double in the first was his major league-leading 50th of the season. \xe2\x80\xa6 Orioles RHP Miguel Gonzalez (9-7) faces Toronto LHP Mark Buehrle (11-8) in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s series finale.

Encina | The Baltimore SunTORONTO \xe2\x80\x93 Even though the two-run homer right-hander Chris Tillman yielded in the seventh inning was the difference on the scoreboard in the Orioles\' 4-3 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday night, the familiar flubs of an offense that continues to struggle with runners in scoring position sealed the club\'s fourth loss in its past five games.These Orioles don\'t like the comparisons between this year\'s club and last year\'s playoff team. They\'ve long turned the page on 2012. But the marked difference between the teams was on display Saturday against a last-place Toronto team.The Orioles were 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position and their record in one-run games worsened to 16-28 \xe2\x80\x94 they went 29-9 in those contests last season. Over the past 21 games, the Orioles are hitting .215 with runners in scoring position. var adSkipCounter = 0; It paints a dreary picture for a team that is 21-27 since winning the first four games after the All-Star break \xe2\x80\x94 hardly a playoff-caliber resume \xe2\x80\x94 with 14 games remaining in the regular season.\xe2\x80\x9cWe understand that every game right now is important,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t think we\'re putting extra pressure on ourselves, but we know we need to win as many as we can. In a way, our backs are against the wall. We\'ve got to fight, do what we can, do the little things. Everything is going to be magnified from here on out and we just need to play good baseball.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles (77-70) were unable to build on the momentum from Friday\'s dramatic win at Rogers Centre, in which Chris Davis snapped a tie with his 50th homer of the season. That 5-3 victory was characterized by timely hitting, solid pitching and good defense.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\'s how you win close games,\xe2\x80\x9d catcher Matt Wieters said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe got a couple of timely hits but not enough today.\xe2\x80\x9dSaid Hardy: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s disappointing. I don\'t know if we saw last night\'s game as the one that was going to make us go 16-0 over the last 16 games, but we know the importance of every game now and we want to go out there and win every single one of them. Obviously, that didn\'t happen today, but we just have to focus on tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles clung to a one-run lead heading into the bottom of the seventh, when Colby Rasmus hit a two-run homer off Tillman into the second deck of the right-field stands. For Tillman (16-6), who became an All-Star this year and in many ways has blossomed into the club\'s best starter, it was the 30th homer he\'s allowed this season, third most in the majors.The Orioles had plenty of chances to build a lead for Tillman throughout the game. They stranded five runners in scoring position and ended four innings with a runner on third base.In a one-run game, that was the difference.Fifteen of the Orioles\' past 21 games have been decided by two or fewer runs, including eight one-run games. The Orioles have a 2-6 record in those games.\xe2\x80\x9cThe good news is we\'ve had urgency all year,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo this isn\'t some different dial we have to go to. Our guys get it, they get it. Like I said, this is a club I get frustrated for, not with, because I know how much it means to them.\xe2\x80\x9dAfter Moises Sierra\'s two-run double in the first inning gave the Blue Jays (68-80) a 2-1 lead, Orioles third baseman Manny Machado tied the game in the third with his 14th homer of the season, a solo shot off Toronto starter Esmil Rogers.Machado hit his 50th double of the season in the first inning, which was following by an RBI double by Davis.The Orioles took a 3-2 lead in the fourth on an RBI single by Wieters that came after back-to-back one-out walks to Nick Markakis and Hardy. But the Orioles couldn\'t capitalize further.Rogers, who dodged damage all day, allowed three runs on five hits over six innings.\xe2\x80\x9cHe uses his offspeed pitches, and he\'s tough because he\'s not going to give in and he\'s going to mix different speeds of breaking balls,\xe2\x80\x9d Wieters said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\'t break through him. We got his pitch count up and got him out of the game quick, but couldn\'t quite break through and get the big hit.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles also had runners at second and third with one out in the sixth and runners at the corners with two outs in the eighth but netted no runs in those innings.The Orioles had the tying run on base in the ninth after Nate McLouth\'s two-out single, but Machado weakly grounded out to the left side of the mound for the final out.Tillman threw an eight-inning complete game in the loss, but he was hurt by a leadoff walk to Sierra in the seventh. Rasmus then crushed an 84-mph changeup for the eventual game winner.\xe2\x80\x9cI made a mistake and he put a good swing on it,\xe2\x80\x9d Tillman said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\'ve got to be better there \xe2\x80\x94 big mistakes early and late. I got to be better in those situations.\xe2\x80\x9dTwo of the four runs against Tillman reached on walks.\xe2\x80\x9cThey killed me tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d Tillman said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey both came back to haunt me.\xe2\x80\x9deencina@baltsun.comtwitter.com/EddieInTheYard     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

But we\xe2\x80\x99ve got options. We can either continue to stink or play better. If we play better, we have a shot.\xe2\x80\x9dBut that shot is dwindling.The Yankees fell three games behind the Texas Rangers and the Tampa Bay Rays in the hunt for one of the two American League wild-card spots, and four games back in the loss column. Worse, they now have two teams, the Cleveland Indians and the Baltimore Orioles, ahead of them in the wild-card standings with only 12 games to play.

While the rotation was stacked with a bevy of interesting arms: a trio of lefties (Eduardo Rodriguez, Tim Berry, and Trent Howard) complimented a trio of righties (Zach Davies, Devin Jones, and Tyler Wilson). The club got off to a decent enough start, going 14-12 in April and 15-12 in May. But June proved to be dreadful as they went 9-17, including a stretch of 13 losses in 16 games from the 8th through the 25th. An 11-16 July followed and the Keys found themselves 8 games below .500 and a roster quickly being depleted as a result of promotions, trades, and injuries. A 10-21 August featured losing streaks of 4 games twice and 6 games once. But they did manage to go undefeated in September (2-0). All in all that adds up to 61-78 record, 2nd worst in the Carolina League. But minor league baseball is so much about team wins and losses; it's about the development of the individual players. And there was much to be excited about on that front. Let's start with a look at the offensive players of note who played for the Keys in 2013. After a 2012 season that saw him suspended for 50 games at the start of the season,  catcher Michael Ohlman got off to a fast start in 2013 before missing over a month with a right shoulder injury. But the 22 year old remained focused and decided to take any frustration he harbored out on Carolina League pitching. Over 100 games played, he slashed .313/.410/.524 with 113 hits (46 of which went for extra bases), and 56 BBs to 93 Ks. In a league known for suppressing offense, Ohlman led in batting, slugging %, OPS, wOBA (weighted on-base average), wRC+ (weighted runs created), and wRAA (weighted runs above average). His .211 ISO (isolated slugging percentage) ranked 2nd. His OBP ranked 3rd. His 0.60 BB/K ratio was 13th best in the league. Oh, and he managed to go a perfect 5/5 in stolen base attempts. Suffice to say, it was just a fantastic offensive season for him. On defense, however, it remains a bit of work in progress. Some notable prospect writers remain unconvinced that he can develop into a sufficient major league quality backstop. If he can take a step forward on defense he could certainly find his name in some top 100 lists next season. 2014 will be a crucial season for him as he will likely make one of the largest jumps in minor league development, from A level baseball to AA.    The 2nd big name on offense for the Keys was 1B/3B Nick Delmonico, the 6th ranked prospect in the O's system coming into the season. After a brief experiment at 2B last season, the O's decided Delmonico was destined for a corner position and installed him at 3B. The bat was very good, particularly for a 20 year old getting his first taste of Advanced A-ball competition. Through 61 games he slashed .243/.350/.469. However, he missed significant time due to a number of injuries. A concussion caused him to miss nearly a month of action in April & May. He also missed multiple game stretches in late May, mid June, and early  July. All the while he struggled to adapt to playing 3B, so when first baseman Christian Walker was promoted to Bowie, Delmonico was moved across the diamond to 1B. This seemed to be his ultimate home with the O's until July 23rd, when he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for (RHP) Francisco Rodriguez. It was certainly a steep price to pay for a relief pitcher. I wish Nicky all the best in his quest to make the majors with the Brew Crew.    1B Christian Walker started his 2013 season with the Low-A Delmarva Shorebirds before getting promoted to Frederick in early May. It did not take long for him to show he could more than handle Carolina League pitching. He put up 4 multi-hit games in his first 12. Over 55 games with the Keys he would form the 3rd part of a fearsome troika with Ohlman and Delmonico. His slash line was .288/.343/.479 with 25 of his 62 hits going for extra bases. By July it was clear he was not being particularly challenged by A-level pitching, and so he was promoted to AA Bowie on July 16th. A few other offensive players deserve quick mentions: (OF) John Ruetigger's 43 SBs ranked 3rd in the Carolina League. OF Dariel Alvarez joined the club in mid August and just smashed, putting up an insane .436/.463/.641 slash line over 10 games while showing off a howitzer for an arm. A combination of injuries and ineffectiveness resulted in disappointing seasons for outfielders Brenden Webb, Glynn Davis, and Trent Mummey.    Now, onto the pitching. 22 year old LHP Tim Berry lead the squad in games started and innings. He put up a respectable 3.85 ERA and 3.69 FIP over his 152.0 IP, with a 119:40 K:BB ratio. 20 year old (RHP) Zach Davies was Berry's fellow rotation stalwart. 26 starts, 148.2 IP of 3.69 ERA and 3.13 FIP. His name will feature prominently on Orioles prospect list come the start of next season. Aside from one spot start for AA Bowie, lefty Trent Howard did yeoman's work for the Keys pitching staff, bouncing back and forth from the bullpen to the rotation. 28 games with 15 starts resulted in 88.0 IP and a 3.48 ERA/3.40 FIP. Ultimately, he will end up in the bullpen, but he should move quick and could be a fresh face (and arm) for the Orioles as soon as late next season. Those 3 spent the entire season with the Keys. But a number of good arms left the Keys and were Bowie bound. Foremost among these was LHP Eduardo Rodriguez, the O's 4th ranked prospect coming into the season. It didn't take too long to see that this 20 year old was more than capable of getting A-level hitters out. 14 starts of 2.85 ERA/3.21 FIP pitching with 65 Ks to 25 BBs over 85.1 IP earned him a promotion to AA Bowie at the beginning of July. About 1 month prior, RHP Tyler Wilson made the jump from Frederick to Bowie, though the stat line didn't suggest such a move was proper at the time. Over 11 starts he pitched 62.1 innings with a 4.48 ERA belying a 3.75 FIP. After a very good 9 start run with the Keys in 2012, RHP Devin Jones needed just one start with the Keys before being promoted to AA Bowie. As the previously mentioned guys packed their bags and headed southbound to Bowie, a number of other baby birds were making the trek up from Delmarva. After getting some 'sleeper prospect' buzz prior to the season courtesy of Keith Law, RHP Brady Wager made the jump from low-A to high-A. He scuffled a bit, putting up a 5.23 ERA, but his 15 starts and 86.0 IP should serve him well going forward into 2014, where he will likely start off in Frederick again. After missing all of 2012, RHP) Matt Hobgood finally managed to get through a full season, splitting time between Delmarva and Frederick. It looks like his days as a starter are behind him, as just one of his total 33 games was a start. He'll need to move quick, as next season will be his last before the O's have to add him to the 40-man roster or risk losing him in the Rule 5 draft. After dominating in Delmarva's pen, LHP Lex Rutledge earned a late season promotion to the Keys. He will be another interesting arm to watch with the Keys in 2014. Who is there to look forward to in 2014? Well, offensively, the Keys may be quite challenged. Michael Ohlman will likely graduate to Bowie. SS Adrian Marin may get promoted from Delmarva. But other than him there isn't much of note down there. Aberdeen has a few guys who could well start off in Frederick, including 1B Trey Mancini and OF Mike Yastrzemski. As for the pitching, Berry, Davies, and Howard will all likely get promoted to Bowie. Wager will remain in the Frederick rotation and probably be joined by a duo from Delmarva, RHP Parker Bridwell and LHP Matt Taylor. Local kid RHP Branden Kline should make his way to Frederick's rotation at some point next season. And I would not in any way be surprised if RHP Hunter Harvey is pitching for the Keys come next summer. In the 'pen, Hobgood & Rutledge should return to form a potent late inning duo.

His work ethic and results have convinced veteran players to trust his positioning calls.Showalter said his eyes have told him the same thing as the numbers \xe2\x80\x94 his club\'s defense is excellent. He praises his players for taking it seriously, an attitude that he said has flowed down to the minors, where prospects know they must play sound defense to earn spots in Baltimore.""I\'m proud of how much emphasis our guys have put on it,"" Showalter said. ""Sooner or later, it\'s got to be about whether they want to. It creates a culture.""If the players put any stock in the error record, it\'s as a historical bookmark on an oft-overlooked area of the game.""I think our defense goes far beyond a lack of errors,"" McLouth said. ""I don\'t think that does it justice. But it\'s kind of a neat thing.

This got me thinking: what other team records are out there, and how does the 2013 team compare? The research led me to another record that Davis will probably break, but it's one that no one is talking about. All numbers are prior to Saturday's game. Batting Hits Miguel Tejada holds the team record with 214 hits in 2006. The closest competitor in 2013 is Manny Machado, who has 181. In the 15 games remaining, Machado would have to get 34 hits. Not likely. Doubles Brian Roberts holds the team record in doubles; he hit 56 in 2009. Machado has 49 so far this year. Eight doubles in 15 games is not impossible, but it's not likely either. (Note: Machado doubled on Saturday, raising his season total to 50.) Triples Paul Blair set the team record for triples in 1967 when he hit 12. Nate McLouth has four so far this year. It's safe to say this record will not be broken.    Home Runs Err --- duh. Batting Average Melvin Mora set the O's record when he hit .340 in 2004. The highest average on the team this year is .292, owned by Davis.    On-Base Percentage Bob Nieman racked up a .442 OBP for the 1956 O's, their third year in Baltimore. He did also play for the White Sox that year, but he qualified as an Oriole. No one on the O's this year even comes close to that. Davis does lead the team with an excellent .378 OBP, however. Coincidentally the highest OBP in the sport this year is .442, owned by Miguel Cabrera.    Walks Ken Singleton walked 118 times in 1975. Davis, again, leads the 2013 O's here with 65 walks this year. BB% Mickey Tettleton walked 19% of the time in 1990. That would be far and away the best in the major leagues in 2013. On the O's, Davis leads with an above-average 10.6% walk rate. Most Strikeouts and Highest K% Ah, now we're into something relevant to 2013. Mark Reynolds K'd the most often in an O's uniform, whiffing 196 times in 2011. Guess who leads the team in K's this year? Yessir, Mr. Davis has 179. Can he break the team record? With roughly 60 PA left in the season, it's a good bet that Davis will eclipse this mark and set (another) new team record. 18 K's is easily achievable for someone who strikes out nearly 30% of the time. Reynolds, unsurprisingly, also holds the team record for highest K% with 31.6% in that magical year of 2011. Davis, also unsurprisingly, leads the team this year with a just-slightly-worse 29.2%. Fewest Strikeouts and Lowest K% Looking at strikeouts from a more positive note, Rich Dauer's 1980 season holds the record for fewest strikeouts (19) and lowest K% (3.1%). (I omitted the 1981 season because it was shortened by a strike.) On your 2013 Orioles, J.J. Hardy leads the way with 65 strikeouts and Nick Markakis owns the best K% at 10.4%. Weighted Runs Created+ Frank Robinson holds the team record for the highest wRC+ in a season, notching 195 wRC+ in1966, which was his first year with the O's. Robinson hit .316/.410.637 with 49 HR, winning his second MVP award. You're probably getting tired of hearing his name (or maybe not!) but in 2013 your obvious leader in team wRC+ is Chris Davis with 173. Pitching Before we get into pitching, recognize that of all the starters the O's have used this season, only Chris Tillman and Miguel Gonzalez qualify for the ERA title in an O's uniform. So you'll see their names come up a lot. ERA Dave McNally set a team record in 1968 when he finished with a 1.95 ERA. Compare this to Chris Tillman's 3.66 ERA in 2013. ERA- Jim Palmer owns the best ERA- in team history, with a 58 he put up in 1975. (Yes, he won the Cy Young that year.) This year Tillman's 86 ERA- leads the O's. FIP Pat Dobson had a 2.64 FIP in 1972. This year, Miguel Gonzalez's 4.52 FIP edges out Tillman's performance. BB% Walks suck, and in 1960 Hal Brown walked just 3.5% of batters. This year, Gonzalez is walking 7.4% of batters. K% Strikeouts are great, and in 2007 Erik Bedard struck out 30.2% of batters he faced. This year Tillman leads O's starters with a 20.8% K rate. K/BB Mike Mussina struck out 4.57 batters for every one he walked back in 2000. This year, The best K/BB ratio is owned by Tillman (2.47). HR/9 Bob Turley has the team record of 0.25 HR/9, which he achieved in 1954. This year Miguel Gonzalez and his 1.31 HR/9 leads the O's. WHIP Dave McNally owns this record; in 1984 he put up a WHIP of 0.84. This year the best on the team is Tillman with 1.23. fWAR No one in 1991 knew what WAR in baseball was, but that year Cal Ripken set the team's record with 10.4. It makes sense; he was a power-hitting shortstop and those are hard to come by. Chris Davis leads the team this year with 6.7 WAR. Pitching WAR is less of a sure thing, but Jim Palmer's 1975 season produced 6.4 WAR, a phenomenal number for a pitcher. This year, Tillman's 1.7 fWAR leads the starting staff.

But after Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays that sank the team further from the second wild-card berth, Girardi conceded the Yankees are on the verge of missing the postseason.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re darn close,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.For a man as angry and disappointed Sunday as he has been all season, his quiet, dejected mood on Tuesday came across almost as resignation to the unsettling reality facing him.With only 11 games remaining, the Yankees are tied with the Kansas City Royals, three and a half games behind the Tampa Bay Rays and the Texas Rangers. Two other teams, the Baltimore Orioles and the Cleveland Indians, are ahead of them.

A. Dickey or the Toronto bullpen. The Yankees managed only five hits for the second straight game, and it seemed as if most of their at-bats against Dickey were over in seconds.Alfonso Soriano said the Yankees were flat and low on energy because of having Monday off, and they found it hard to overcome their inertia.

Wild-Card Race, Yankees Are on Outside Looking for a Miracle SEPT. 16, 2013                       ', 'www.nytimes.com'), (""Orioles 3, Red Sox 2: Davis hits #51 to tie, O's score on ..."", ' This was just one of those games. Watching the Orioles, it felt like they had no chance to win. Scott Feldman allowed a home run to the first batter he faced and walked six, a career high. Manny Machado made two errors, and Nate McLouth one. The bats went 0-6 with runners in scoring position. And yet, there\'s a 3-2 win in the boxscore. How? Orioles Magic, that\'s how. In the first, Manny Machado singled with one out, but Chris Davis and Adam Jones struck out. Scott Feldman took the mound and surrendered a homer to leadoff batter Dustin Pedroia, and then walked Shane Victorino thanks to a tight strike zone. David Ortiz helped Feldman out by hitting into a well-turned double play, though, and Mike Napoli grounded out to third. Danny Valencia drew a one-out walk in the second, but Matt Wieters and J.J. Hardy both grounded out. Feldman got himself in a jam in Boston\'s half, striking Daniel Nava out looking before giving up a one-out double to Mike Carp. Jarrod Saltalamacchia grounded out, but Stephen Drew walked, putting runners on the corners with two down. Drew then stole second, and Xander Bogaerts walked, loading the bases. Dustin Pedroia, who had already homered, then stepped to the plate... but despite the sense of impending doom all Oriole fans must have been feeling, he lined out to Brian Roberts. Things were pretty uneventful for the next inning-and-a-half, as the O\'s went down in order in both the third and fourth, and Scott Feldman surrendered a two-out walk without consequence in the former. In the bottom of the fourth, that sense of dread arose again, though. Manny Machado made a rare error to allow Saltalamacchia to reach with one out, and Feldman walked Drew, the former\'s fifth free pass of the game. The runners then both stole a base on Feldman\'s first pitch to Xander Bogaerts, after which Bogaerts hit a line drive to Nate McLouth... who couldn\'t quite catch it, allowing a run and putting runners on first and third with one down.\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, Dustin Pedroia - like I said, impending doom again - grounded into a 5-4-3 double play, leaving the score at 2-0.    Danny Valencia drew his second walk of the game to lead off the fifth. Matt Wieters followed with a sharp lineout to second, but then J.J. Hardy hit a double off of the Monster, putting the tying runs on base for Brian Roberts. Roberts quickly ended up in an 0-2 hole thanks to a wide strike zone, but he managed to drive in Valencia with a groundout to short, making the score 2-1. Nate McLouth then walked, bringing Manny Machado to the plate with runners on first and second and two outs, but Manny popped out to short. Feldman continued to grind out innings in the bottom half, getting two quick outs before walking a career-high sixth batter, but retiring Daniel Nava on the first pitch with a flyout to left.    Chris Davis led off the sixth inning with a new Oriole record to tie the game: yes, his 51st home run, to straightaway center field. Adam Jones followed with an eight-pitch walk, and Nick Markakis came up to bat. With a 2-1 count and Adam Jones running, Nick drove the ball just shy of the warning track in center field, which would\'ve easily been an RBI double if not for a great catch by Shane Victorino. Danny Valencia then made his first out of the night by grounding into a 6-4-3 double play, and the score remained 2-2. Thanks to Feldman\'s struggles, T.J. McFarland came on to pitch the sixth. He was impressive, setting the Sox down in order on a groundout and a pair of strikeouts. In the seventh, the O\'s went down in order for the third time tonight, and Buck Showalter turned to Kevin Gausman. He became the second pitcher victimized by poor defense from Manny Machado, as Dustin Pedroia reached base with one out on Manny\'s second error of the night. Again, though, the O\'s got away with allowing an extra out, as Shane Victorino grounded into a 5-4-3 double play.    The two Orioles who made errors started the eighth inning off with redemption in mind. Nate McLouth led off with a single to right, and then Manny Machado lined a double down the right-field line, giving Chris Davis a pair of runners in scoring position with no outs. That\'s a great opportunity to score, but Chris Davis and Adam Jones both grounded out to short - resulting in no runs, with the infield drawn in - and Nick Markakis flied out to left. It\'s simply astounding how much trouble the team has had with RISP lately. The bottom of the inning brought Brian Matusz to the mound to get David Ortiz out, and he did so, striking him out for the twelfth time in twenty plate appearances. Tommy Hunter then came on, and he retired both of the batters he faced. Former Oriole Koji Uehara came on for the ninth and promptly gave up a leadoff triple to Danny Valencia. Alexi Casilla entered the game as a pinch-runner, and the O\'s would once again have three chances to get a runner home from third. Matt Wieters decided to take care of that immediately, cracking a sacrifice fly to right field on the second pitch of his at-bat. That, by the way, was the first run allowed by Uehara since 6 July, and the first earned run since 30 June. Koji retired J.J. Hardy and Brian Roberts, but the game was now up to Jim Johnson. Fortunately, Jim Johnson was the good version tonight. He retired Mike Carp on a groundout before allowing Jarrod ""seriously, copy-paste my name"" Saltalamacchia to hit a bounder up the middle for a hit. Stephen Drew hit another grounder to the middle, but Johnson was able to snare this one; with pinch-runner Quintin Berry moving with the pitch, however, he had to settle for the out at first. Johnson then struck out Xander Bogaerts on four pitches to secure the 3-2 win. As of writing, the Rays have already lost to the Rangers, evening their records at 82-68 and putting the Orioles two games behind their Wild Card berths. The Yankees lost, putting them 1.5 games behind the O\'s, and the Indians and Royals are still playing. Regardless of how that game goes, Cleveland will be the only team between the O\'s and the two Wild Card slots - and regardless of that, the Orioles just need to keep winning if they want to make the playoffs. Tomorrow night\'s game pits Wei-Yin Chen against Jake Peavy.

A day off is always welcome at this point in the season, but the Orioles are certainly hoping that being off yesterday breaks up Boston\xe2\x80\x99s momentum and does nothing to theirs.Whether or not the Orioles are even peaking (after one series against a team they probably should beat anyways) is another story, however if they are peaking they\xe2\x80\x99re doing so at the right time. I still maintain that if the O\xe2\x80\x99s can win two-of-three the rest of the way (perhaps sweeping Toronto at home and taking three-of-four in Tampa), they should find a way into the post season.

The names \xe2\x80\x94 Gleason, Hemming, Reitz \xe2\x80\x94 would mean little to most modern fans.Yet the players belonged to perhaps the greatest team in local baseball history, the cards to a set so rare that owning them changed Dan McKee\'s life. He sold them for six figures in 2006, earning enough on the deal to purchase his family\'s dream home in northern Baltimore County.But for the 51-year-old lifelong hobbyist, the sale also came to represent the way collecting has changed from an innocent pursuit into a high-stakes trade. He never thought he\'d part with the cards, and now that they\'re on the market again, he said he\'d ""have to rob a bank"" to get them back. var adSkipCounter = 0; ""You could say there was \'before the Alpha cards and after the Alpha cards,\'"" said McKee, who also works as a software developer.Only one such set is known to exist, making it ""one of card collecting\'s most legendary and rarest issues,"" according to a catalog published by Robert Edwards Auctions of New Jersey, which specializes in memorabilia.Printed by the old Alpha Photo-Engraving Co. in Baltimore, they show 15 members of the 1894 Baltimore Orioles of the National League.Pitchers George Hemming and Kid Gleason and infielder Henry (Heinie) Reitz starred for the team, which featured seven future Hall of Famers, collectively hit .343 and finished 50 games above .500.The saga of Dan and the Alphas began, in a way, 44 years ago, when he was growing up in middle-class Reisterstown.His father, Lambert (""Dan"") McKee, a construction company manager, collected vintage coins and other artifacts, many of them off the mainstream hobbyists\' path.In 1969, when Dan Jr. was seven, the Orioles were an established power in the American League East, winning 109 games en route to a World Series appearance. Dan\'s path became clear: He\'d collect baseball cards.In those days, he insisted, it didn\'t occur to him to measure their value in dollars. What he valued was the simple joys they represented, like riding his bike every week to a local store to score Topps\' latest.The five-cent packs contained five cards and a sweet-smelling slab of gum.""I had a happy childhood,"" he said. ""It\'s why I collect. I think looking through my stuff is a way to remember.""He kept at it, amassing a complete big-league set each year and learning to save ""doubles"" to trade his way up. He learned history \xe2\x80\x94 how tobacco companies published the cards starting in the 1880s, then bread and clothing firms, then Bowman, Topps and other bubble-gum outfits.As Dan Sr. took him to memorabilia shows, he never took to baseball much \xe2\x80\x94 ""too slow,"" he said \xe2\x80\x94 but the cards depicting it were something else.They exuded history, embodying the way baseball and the culture changed together from the pre-World War II era through modern-day life. Yet one tale was missing.Collectors familiar with Baltimore sports had long told him of a great team even locals were beginning to forget \xe2\x80\x94 the 1894 Orioles, a squad so formidable that historians have compared them to the 1927 New York Yankees.Playing in the National League, the only major circuit of the day, they finished ahead of 11 other teams, including the second-place New York Giants and the cellar-dwelling Louisville Colonels. They finished 89-39, averaged 9.14 runs per game and established an aggressive, often dirty style of play.The players included third baseman John McGraw, later one of the greatest managers in history; shortstop Hughie Jennings who later managed the Detroit Tigers to several World Series victories; and William (""Wee Willie"") Keeler, the right fielder who reeled off eight straight 200-hit seasons while popularizing the phrase ""Hit \'em where they ain\'t.""Yet no collectors McKee knew had ever heard of a card set showing the team.In 1992, that changed.Dan the elder was at a Sotheby\'s auction in New York, trolling for oddball cards, when he realized a consigner was offering a set that showed 14 of the team\'s 16 members.It was printed by Alpha, a long-defunct company described only briefly in the auction catalog. For reasons unknown, it didn\'t include Keeler, the team\'s biggest star, or backup catcher William ""Boileryard"" Clarke. But the rest were there.The cards were the first ever made for some of the players, including Keeler. That made them ""rookie cards,"" a genus that exploded in value during a collecting boom in the early 1990s.The set failed to meet its reserve price of $3,000, perhaps because collectors had no idea it was coming. The consigner sold the cards separately to others around the country.McKee\'s appetite was whetted, and he kept watch.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

Abreu, a powerfully built right-handed hitter, loaded up on his back leg, waited on a curveball and hit a towering drive halfway up the outfield stands. Thirty major league front offices were surely paying attention.Last month, Abreu defected from Cuba, the latest player to leave the nation to pursue a major league career. Yasiel Puig\xe2\x80\x99s electric summer in Los Angeles for the Dodgers and Yoenis Cespedes\xe2\x80\x99s success with the Oakland Athletics the past two seasons have helped to fuel the hype surrounding Abreu\xe2\x80\x99s imminent arrival in the majors.

An international scout for one major league team said that Alfredo Despaigne and Frederich Cepeda, outfielders on the Cuban national team, were more dangerous hitters.An international scout for another team said that major league clubs could not afford to make a mistake when spending big on a first baseman, since it is a traditional power position filled by players who bat in the middle of the lineup. In other words, the scout said, the same money that could be used to sign Abreu might be better spent in the acquisition of one of the many established first basemen \xe2\x80\x9cyou already know can hit big league pitching.\xe2\x80\x9d Photo       It is possible that when Abreu does sign, his deal will be the richest of any Cuban defector, topping the Dodgers\xe2\x80\x99 Yasiel Puig\xe2\x80\x99s $42 million.

Absalon-USA TODAY SportsWhat do people think of when talking about the past month of Baltimore Orioles baseball? The struggle of the lineup to make it count with runners in scoring position, Chris Davis breaking Brady Anderson\xe2\x80\x98s franchise record for single-season home runs, and the end of the season creeping up on us all with the Orioles battling for a wild card spot come to mind. What about Danny Valencia? The hottest hitter in the past month on the Orioles roster has made the most out of what he has been given this year and has delivered many crucial hits to keep Baltimore fighting for an extension on their 2013 campaign.In the past 28 days, the 28-year old from the University of Miami has posted a batting line that is only seen in video games. Valencia is batting .447 with a slugging percentage of .809 and 38 total bases since August 22nd and even more impressive of these 28 games he has only 13 of them and is still putting up fantastic numbers. Most recently Valencia tripled in the top of the 9th on Monday night against the Red Sox, this hit was eventually driven in by a Matt Weiters sacrifice fly and gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a much needed win in Boston. Valencia has done it all, he has started and performed well (4 hits including one double in a loss to the Yankees on the 11th), but has also come in as a pinch batter and has delivered clutch hits.Valencia has played with the Norfolk Tides for the majority of this year but has impressed Buck Showalter enough to pull him up on the expanded 40-man roster and that move has payed off for the Orioles. Valencia has cracked the starting lineup in 8 of the last 10 games and in that stretch has compiled a batting average of .393 and 8 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s. He has given the Orioles a reliable bat this past month, in a span of games where the ability of the O\xe2\x80\x99s to score with runners in scoring position has been tested and has cost the Orioles quite a few games. It is in Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s best interest to keep penciling this kid into the batting rotation, he\xe2\x80\x99s worked hard to get pulled up to the expanded roster and has put himself into a position to become a mainstay in the Orioles lineup for the rest of the 2013 regular season.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Chris Davis hit lifts Orioles past Red Sox in 12 - USA TODAY', 'Baltimore Orioles first baseman Chris Davis hits a single to drive in two runs in the 12th inning against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park.(Photo: David Butler II, USA TODAY Sports)Story HighlightsThe Orioles beat the Red Sox, 5-3, in 12 inningsThe Red Sox would have clinched a playoff spot with a win -- their magic number is now oneJim Johnson got the final three outs for his AL-leading 47th saveCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBOSTON (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Chris Davis has rewritten the Baltimore Orioles record book with 51 homers, and he leads the majors with 92 extra-base hits.Sometimes a single is good enough.The Orioles slugger drove in the game-winning runs with his 12th-inning single to beat Boston 5-3 on Wednesday night and help Baltimore avoid elimination in the AL East.

He struck out four of the first six batters he faced and didn't allow a baserunner until there were two outs in the third inning, when he walked Brian Roberts. He hit Adam Jones with a pitch in the fourth inning, but the Orioles went into the fifth still looking for their first hit of the game. Chen, on the other hand, was constantly in trouble. He needed double play balls to get out of the second and third innings, and in the third he loaded the bases before recording an out. He constantly looked on the edge of falling apart, but he didn't. The O's offense rewarded him for that in the top of the fifth.    Danny Valencia lead off the fifth inning for the Orioles and singled to left field for the team's first hit of the day. Of course it was Valencia, with the way he's been hitting lately. He came in to score on a double by Matt Wieters, then Wieters scored on a double by Brian Roberts. Roberts was stranded at second base, but the game was tied.    It didn't stay tied long, though. Peavy retired Chris Davis and Adam Jones to start the sixth innings but allowed Nick Markakis and Valencia to reach on singles. Again Wieters doubled and again a run scored. It probably could have been two but the ball went into the stands so Valencia had to stay at third. Both he and Wieters were stranded when J.J. Hardy grounded out to end the inning. There was no reason not to send Chen back out for the bottom of the sixth inning, but it still felt kind of wrong. Turns out it was right to feel wrong because Mike Napoli greeted Chen with a solo home run to start things. Chen got two outs but also let two more batters reach base, and that was it for him. Buck Showalter called on Francisco Rodriguez to get out of the inning, and he induced a ground ball from David Ross that resulted in the third out.    Peavy lasted through the seventh inning but after that it was the battle of the bullpens. Kevin Gausman pitched two innings and was absolutely brilliant. He struck out five batters and didn't allow a base hit. He struck out the side in the eighth inning swinging. Tommy Hunter followed that with two scoreless innings of his own, even though there was a scary moment when Hunter had to face Ortiz in the bottom of the tenth inning. With a runner on it seemed to me like a bad idea to let Hunter face a lefty like Ortiz, but again I proved why I'm not a manager. Ortiz grounded into a double play and Hunter got Napoli out to end the inning. After T.J. McFarland pitched a scoreless eleventh inning, the Orioles offense finally came through. They had failed against relief pitchers Craig Breslow, Junichi Tazawa, and Koji Uehara, but Franklin Morales' second inning of work was too much for him. Two singles and an intentional walk led to Chris Davis coming up to bat with the bases loaded and two outs. I dreamed of home run #52, but that wasn't meant to be. Instead Davis chopped a single back up the middle that looked off the bat like it would be fielded as a grounder in the infield. But it just sneaked through as Roberts and Hardy scored on the play. Davis then got himself picked off first to end the inning, but nobody's perfect. Jim Johnson was called upon to seal the win and there was a little drama, but not too much considering who was on the mound. Jarrod Saltalamacchia singled to right field, bringing the tying run to the plate. But instead of hitting a game-tying home run, Dustin Pedroia hit a ground ball that looked like it would be a double play. Roberts botched the throw, though, so they only got one out. Pinch hitter Jackie Bradley, Jr. hit the ball back to Johnson, who threw to second. Hardy was able get the out, but the throw was wide and he had no chance at turning a double play. With two outs, Ortiz stepped to the plate, hoping I'm sure to get to do a little more posing at the plate. But he was denied the pleasure as, instead of hitting another home run, he harmlessly grounded out to second base. O's win! They will go for the sweep of the Red Sox tomorrow with Chris Tillman pitching against John Lackey. The Indians lost tonight and the Rays beat the Rangers, so now the Orioles are 1/2 game behind Cleveland and 1 game behind Texas, who is still the second WC team.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles 1, Red Sox 3: Sox clinch a trip to ... - Camden Chat', "" I didn't have much faith in the Orioles' ability to sweep the series against John Lackey, but I didn't envision an almost no hitter, either. Starting pitcher Chris Tillman had a solid game but it couldn't match Lackey, who didn't allow a hit until the seventh inning and ultimately threw a complete game two-hitter. From the get go it looked like Tillman might not be long for the game. After two baserunners and 26 pitches in the first inning, the Red Sox scored all three of their runs in the second inning. Jarrod Saltalamacchia doubled and came in to score on Stephen Drew's 13th home run of the season. Jackie Bradley Jr. followed that with a double, and an RBI single by Dustin Pedroia knocked him in to give the Red Sox a 3-0 lead. All told Tillman faced eight batters in the inning and finished with 53 pitches thrown. After that it was like a switch was thrown and Tillman was a new pitcher. He went on to pitch seven innings and allowed just two more baserunners, one each in the fourth and sixth innings. His final line was 7 IP, 3 H, 3 R, 2 BB, 8 K. I'll take that line from an Orioles starting pitcher any night, but on this night it wasn't enough. Lackey had the Orioles flailing from the get go. They didn't have a baserunner until Brian Roberts walked with two outs in the third inning and didn't have another Nate McLouth walked in the sixth. The scored remained close enough that there was hope with each walk, but the Orioles couldn't do anything with them.    Finally, in the seventh inning, Adam Jones broke up the no-no in a big way. He hit a monster home run to left field that sailed completely out of the ball park to make the score 3-1. The Orioles were coming back! Just kidding, no they weren't. Lackey gave up one more hit, a single to J.J. Hardy in the eighth inning, then retired the side in order in the ninth inning to clinch the win and the Red Sox postseason berth. Going into this series I would have taken two out of three without hesitation, so in that sense it was a success. But man, it would have been sweet to have a sweep. Tomorrow the Orioles start a four-game series in Tampa Bay and by the end of it, we should know if they'll be in the playoffs this season.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
09/20/2013,"[('Orioles Minor League Recap: Aberdeen Ironbirds', "" Short-Season A-Ball is typically a stop for draftees from the most recent draft. 2013 saw 19 of the O's 2013 draft class make an appearance with the Ironbirds, including late-season performances from the first 3 O's selections: RHP Hunter Harvey, CF Josh Hart, and C Chance Sisco. The season did not, however, get off to an auspicious start. The 'Birds lost their first 5 games, were outscored 28-7, and were shutout twice. But by the end of the first week of July they had turned their season around, winning 5 straight to start the month with a 29-10 run differential. They finished the year at 40-32, winning the McNamara Division thanks to a 5-0 stretch to end the season. Their division victory earned them a 1st Round playoff matchup with Houston Astros affiliate Tri-City. In spite of two masterful pitching performances, the Ironbirds were swept out of the best of 3 series in two games; shutout both times on offense. But there was much to be encouraged about from the individual players on the team. Let's have a look at some of them. The offense was paced by a powerful troika of 2013 draft picks: CF Mike Yastrzemski, 1B Trey Mancini, and OF Conor Bierfeldt. The 22-year-old Bierfeldt lead the New York Penn League in both Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA) and Weighted Runs Created+ (wRC+) with a .402 wOBA and a 161 wRC+. His 12 home runs ranked 2nd in the league while he lead the league in SLG (.511), OPS (.862) and ISO (.247). I personally got to witness him launch a rather majestic shot to LF at one game. His bat will be his carrying tool, and he will advance as far as that takes him. He's one to watch in Delmarva next season. Mike Yastrzemski (grandson of Carl) was taken by the O's in the 14th round out of Vanderbilt. He's a slight lefty with a good command of the strike zone and good instincts and reactions in the field. Like Bierfeldt, he maintained an above 10% BB rate, but with a K% 6 points lower. A .273/.362/.420 slash line is quite acceptable from a center fielder with strong defensive skills as well (7 OF Assists and 0 Errors). He did, however, get thrown out attempting to steal 8 times in 16 attempts. Definitely going to have to improve there. His margin for error is small, as his stature and power may not translate into a corner outfield position, where he may well be driven before long thanks to a player who I will get to mentioning in a moment.    But first, let's give a nod to Trey Mancini. A hulking fellow, Mancini was drafted in the 8th round out of Notre Dame. A well rounded hitter, he slashed .328/.382/.449. Those marks were good for 2nd/5th/8th in the NYPL, while his .831 OPS ranked 2nd behind only Bierfeldt. His BB% was low at just 7.0%, but so was his K% (15.1%). The O's could certainly use a nice power hitting prospect in the system. Mancini could be the 2014 version of Christian Walker, as he'll probably start in Delmarva where he'll have an opportunity to feast on pitching he may be more advanced than.    The most prolific name coming into the season for the Ironbirds was 3B Hector Veloz. Unfortunately, it was a dreadful season for the former Bonus Baby. .213/.277/.332, he struggled with his approach all season, striking out in over 30% of his PAs. He's still just 19 though, so I wouldn't be at all surprised if he is held back to start the season with Aberdeen again. If he comes out of the gate hot he could get a quick promotion to Delmarva. So...who is this mystery man that threatens to drink Mike Yastrzemski's milkshake? It's Josh Hart, who was promoted from the GCL late in the season. Hart only got 11 PAs over 3 games, and he didn't do much of anything with them, but it was clear throughout the season that this kid is quite a talent. He'll be just 19 next season, but he already has a decent command of the strike zone, runs the bases well, and plays just superb defense out in center field. Though I think it unlikely at the moment, the O's could choose to be aggressive with him and start him off at Delmarva. More likely though, I think he starts off in Aberdeen again, which would allow Yastrzemski a chance to prove his bona fides with the Shorebirds.    Wow. Was there ever a lot of pitching on this squad. 21-year-old RHP Sebastian Vader made his 2nd go 'round in the NYPL an impressive one. 13 starts with a 2.43 ERA over 85.1 IP. He allowed just 70 hits, with only one of those being a HR, and sported a 64:18 K:BB ratio. He'll form part of an interesting and exciting rotation in Delmarva next season. Joining him will be 2013 9th round pick LHP Mitch Horacek, who made 11 starts, tossing 64.2 innings of 2.78 ERA ball. Like Vader, a little light on the Ks with just 45 (6.3 per 9), but with exceptional control: just 7 BBs and 1 HR allowed. Fellow 2013 draft pick (11th round) and southpaw, Stephen Brault also fared quite well. 12 starts, but only 43.0 IP due to pitch counts I suppose, he sported a 2.09 ERA with a 22.5% K rate. There was also a duo 21-year-old RHP relievers who made themselves known: 2013 13th round pick Jimmy Yacabonis and Alexander Santana, out of the Dominican Republic. Santana plowed through hitters to the tune of a 33.8% K rate and 12.8 K/9. He did walk 18 over his 33.2 IP, but you take the good with the bad. Yacabonis wasn't quite as overpowering, but he did manage to K 28 over his 29.2 IP. And though he walked 14 over that span, he maintained a 1.52 ERA by keeping the ball in the yard. 37 ground ball outs and no HRs allowed. That'll play. But all of that is mere appetizer to the main course. The steak who brought the sizzle: RHP and 2013 1st round selection Hunter Harvey. Double H didn't ascend to Aberdeen until August 20th, spending the intervening 2 months after being drafted down in Sarasota. But from the time he debuted he made it clear that he, a mere 3 months out of high school, was much better than the mostly college aged hitters he was facing. Just 12.0 IP in the regular season, he K'd 15 and BB'd just 4 using mostly just his magnificent fastball and hammer curve, while flashing a modest change. A 2.25 ERA was nice enough, but the 1.70 FIP is downright divine. And then there was the playoff start. Facing elimination, Harvey went and tossed 5 no-hit & no-walk innings while K'ing 7 (the 2 runners who reached were both via HBP). Just dominant. He has nothing to prove in short-season ball so he will go and head Delmarva's rotation to start the year next season, and he will do so with a growing volume of scouting raves and reviews. Baseball Prospectus is going to be blowing Harvey up come prospect list season. Look for him to slot into the top 50, possibly very easily. And he will be the O's 2nd ranked prospect, trailing just Dylan Bundy. If you have the chance to, go see this kid pitch.

He was taken off the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 roster days later anyway.That next week was one of the strangest periods of O\xe2\x80\x99Day\xe2\x80\x99s twisting and turning life story. He was claimed by the Texas Rangers and flew to Toronto to meet his new team. When he arrived at Rogers Centre, the Rangers and Blue Jays were locked in an extra-inning game. O\xe2\x80\x99Day learned he may be needed in the bullpen immediately, but, as always, there was a twist. var adSkipCounter = 0; The Rangers didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a uniform for O\xe2\x80\x99Day. So he had to wear one reserved for left-handed minor leaguer Kason Gabbard. In the bottom of the 11th inning, with two on and one out, O\xe2\x80\x99Day was summoned into the game wearing the jersey of a guy he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. When he took the mound, he had to introduce himself to Rangers manager Ron Washington.O\xe2\x80\x99Day gave up a walkoff single to former Oriole Kevin Millar, the only batter he faced. The Rangers then boarded a plane for their next road series in Baltimore. The following day O\xe2\x80\x99Day rented a car and drove roughly 90 minutes to a Williamsport cemetery, near Hagerstown, to visit Adenhart\xe2\x80\x99s grave.\xe2\x80\x9cIt was poetic, in retrospect,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Day said. \xe2\x80\x9cDrove around for an hour trying to find some flowers.

I\xe2\x80\x99m spending all of my time out here worrying about if I\xe2\x80\x99m good enough to be here instead of really finding out if I am.

The next year he dealt with injuries and the Rangers attempted to slip him through waivers in October.The Orioles claimed him even though they were in between general managers and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an official front office leader (Dan Duquette was hired a week later). In 2012, O\xe2\x80\x99Day became the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 most trusted set-up man, and he has continued to thrive in a late-inning role \xe2\x80\x94 compiling a 2.35 ERA in 132 career appearances as an Oriole.

Unless they sweep the next three here, the Orioles will return to Baltimore trailing the Rays with only six games remaining in 2013.Looking to jumpstart an offense that had gone stale much of this month \xe2\x80\x93 the Orioles had hit .222 with runners in scoring position in their past six games while stranding 41 runners total \xe2\x80\x93 Showalter mixed up his lineup Friday night. He shifted Machado from second in the order to first, Adam Jones from third to second and moved red-hot Danny Valencia into the cleanup spot.It didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly light a fire under the Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 they were 3-for-12 with runners in scoring position, left 13 men on base and had just two hits after the seventh inning \xe2\x80\x93 but the new configuration yielded two key runs in the seventh to give the Orioles their first lead.No. 9 hitter Brian Roberts led off with a 10-pitch walk against reliever Jake McGee, who then hit Machado on the right hand with a pitch. Jones followed with a RBI double against lefty Alex Torres to tie the game at 3-3. With one out, Valencia hit a sacrifice fly to center to score the go-ahead run.Rookie Kevin Gausman gave up the lead on an RBI single by Ben Zobrist in the bottom of the seventh. It was the first earned run allowed by the Orioles bullpen since Sept. 11th \xe2\x80\x93 a span of 21 2/3 innings over nine games.The Orioles bullpen started another scoreless streak after that, thanks in part to Josh Stinson, who threw 2 1/3 perfect innings of relief and Bud Norris, who also was forced to come out of the bullpen in the club\xe2\x80\x99s previous longest game this year in Arizona. Norris (10-12, 4-3 with the Orioles) lost that one and lost this one \xe2\x80\x93 after giving up a double to Desmond Jennings and DeJesus\xe2\x80\x99 single.Jennings who scored the game-winner, had been scratched from the starting lineup with a sore neck but got four at-bats in the game.\xc2\xa0""Very proud [of the bullpen],"" said Orioles reliever T.J. McFarland, who worked two scoreless innings before giving way to Norris. ""Everyone just came out there and threw well. Everybody did. Every single person in that pen that came out today was on point, attacking hitters.""Nobody in our pen, nobody on our pitching staff would ever deny the ball. Everybody wants the ball. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I felt.""On a night that featured a combined 593 pitches, Showalter went to his bullpen first, spelling Jason Hammel to start the sixth after a spotty but ultimately solid outing.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

(AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Tampa Bay Rays manager Joe Maddon was more than happy to wait until the early morning hours for what he called an incredible victory. David DeJesus ended a nearly seven-hour game with a one-out RBI single in the 18th inning, and the Tampa Bay Rays took over sole possession of the top AL wild-card spot by beating the Baltimore Orioles 5-4 on Friday night. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously, both teams really battled extremely hard,\xe2\x80\x9d Maddon said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know both teams wanted to win it badly. To win that game means a lot based on the time of the year that it is.\xe2\x80\x9d Tampa Bay started its game at 7:11 p.m., tied with Texas atop a crowded race for the two AL wild cards. By the time it ended 6 hours, 54 minutes later \xe2\x80\x94 a record in time for both teams \xe2\x80\x94 the Rays were a half-game ahead of Cleveland, which beat Houston 2-1 in a rain-shortened game. The Rangers lost to Kansas City 2-1 and dropped a half-game behind. Baltimore is 2 1/2 back. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s everything right there that you play 162 games for,\xe2\x80\x9d Tampa Bay\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Gimenez said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been a part of a game that long. To win it, especially how we did it, I hope this is something we can take and kind of run with. It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen at a better time, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that much. It\xe2\x80\x99s a huge win for us. The only thing we can control is how we go out and play. If we win, we\xe2\x80\x99re in. Got that Al Davis mentality, `Just win baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x98 Desmond Jennings had a one-out double in the 18th off Bud Norris (10-12) \xe2\x80\x94 the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 10th pitcher and one of a big league-record 21 used in the game. After Yunel Escobar walked, DeJesus won it on his line single to center, ending the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 longest game in franchise history and setting off a wild celebration. Luke Scott of the Rays came onto the field wearing a Chewbacca mask, while Jamey Wright dressed like a member of the rock band Kiss. Now the AL East rivals get to do it all over again at 1:05 p.m. Saturday. The Miami Marlins beat the New York Mets 2-1 in 20 innings earlier this season, the longest game by innings in three years. That game only took 6 hours, 25 minutes. Jeremy Hellickson (12-9), Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled starter, allowed one hit in 2 1/3 innings of relief. Maddon said a decision on who will pitch Sunday has not been made. Ben Zobrist drove in the tying run in the seventh with an RBI single off Kevin Gausman after the Rays blew a 3-2 lead in the top half. Adam Jones greeted reliever Alex Torres with an RBI double and Danny Valencia had a sacrifice fly to give Baltimore the temporary lead. After Zobrist tied it, the teams traded zeros long into the night. From the eighth inning on, the Orioles had just two hits. The Rays had six. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo teams wanted something very badly and that\xe2\x80\x99s why those game go on like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe game\xe2\x80\x99s not always fair that night, but it usually evens out. We\xe2\x80\x99re all operating under the same umbrella and it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the job description that you know, going in, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be some times that will be challenging.\xe2\x80\x9d Tampa Bay loaded the bases with two outs in the 15th, but failed to score when Tim Beckham was retired on a hard grounder to second. The Rays grabbed a 2-0 advantage in the first. Zobrist had an RBI double and later scored when first baseman Chris Davis was charged with an error for misplaying Matt Joyce\xe2\x80\x99s grounder. Tampa Bay went ahead 3-0 during the second when slow-footed catcher Jose Molina doubled, went to third when Escobar hit a fly ball and scored on DeJesus\xe2\x80\x99 sacrifice fly. Molina received a standing ovation after scoring. Orioles starter Jason Hammel, winless in his last 12 starts since beating Washington on May 27, gave up three runs and six hits over five innings. Tampa Bay left-hander David Price, who has gone five starts without a victory, allowed two runs and nine hits in his five-plus innings. \xe2\x80\x9cDevastating obviously,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles third baseman Manny Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been much better if we had come out on top.\xe2\x80\x9d NOTES: There were 593 pitches, 301 by the Rays and 292 by Baltimore, thrown in the game. \xe2\x80\xa6 Machado got hit around right hand by Jake McGee\xe2\x80\x99s pitch in the seventh, but remained in the game. \xe2\x80\xa6 Jennings was a late scratch due to neck stiffness. He had a pinch-hit infield single in the 9th and stayed in the game to play center. \xe2\x80\xa6 Tampa Bay recalled RHP Jake Odorizzi from Triple-A Durham. (Copyright 2013 by The Associated Press.

(In a sense FOX \xe2\x80\x9crented\xe2\x80\x9d Thorne for the day from MASN, and for the record I felt that they did a great job in pairing him with Verducci.) The two of them brought up what I felt was an interesting angle regarding the Baltimore Orioles, and one that perhaps we can look at in some depth over the course of the coming off season. The O\xe2\x80\x99s have five players who have played 150+ games, so in a sense they\xe2\x80\x99ve used variations of the same lineup all season long. One might ask how that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing, and for the most part it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. However, does it allow a team to become one-dimensional?Miguel Gonzalez was able to provide a tired Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen with some quality innings in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 6 IP, 2 H, 3 R, 5 BB, 2 K. The death blow came in the fifth inning when Gonzalez walked Molina and Yunel Escobar, only to give Desmond Jennings the fastball on which he was sitting and to have him hammer it out of Tropicana Field. (And keep that in the back of your minds, as it figures into the premise of this article.) Jennings would add an RBI-triple in the seventh, and he would later score on Ben Zobrist\xe2\x80\x98s RBI-single. Chris Davis would get his first triple of the season with one out in the 9th on David DeJesus\xe2\x80\x98 misplayed ball in left field, and he would score the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lone run on Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-single.With a few exceptions, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup has been the same all year long. The DH role has been platooned, and of course has been ineffective for the Birds. Second base duties rotated around a bunch, as did left field. However we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the likes of Wieters, Davis, Hardy, Machado, Jones, and Markakis being put into the lineup in ink on a daily basis. (Wieters of course would have his day game after a night game off and so forth.) Without a doubt, those players have tired down the stretch. We talked a lot this year about the bullpen being tired with starters not going deep into games, and in effect it\xe2\x80\x99s really the same principle.A lot of these players might not have the strength to be anything more than one-dimensional hitters at this point in the season after playing so many games. So what exactly does that mean, and how do you really remedy it? Players are always going to have their strengths and weaknesses. Adam Jones is a great fastball hitter, and in my opinion one of the best two-strike hitters in baseball. However he struggles with the low-and-away slider. Of late I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing more low-and-away sliders coming his way, and the same is true with Davis being pitched up as opposed to inside. This is not a knock on these players or on anyone else, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply saying that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to protect the plate in given situations whereas earlier in the year when they were a bit more spry perhaps they did.And this is not unique to at-bats either. Manny Machado committed two errors in the field in a game earlier this week in Boston, and J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x98s committed a few in the past couple of weeks as well. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s similar to what I went through starting at about 1 AM on Saturday morning during that marathon game. At a certain point, your brain sometimes hits a wall and ceases to function correctly! In this case your level of athleticism reaches empty, and again that\xe2\x80\x99s not a knock on any of these players. However in a nutshell, the players are still able to play to their strengths but they lose the ability to fight off their weaknesses, making them much more easily defensed.Courtesy of USA TodayWhat it does mean however is that perhaps in the off season the Birds need to focus a bit more on beefing up their bench. If that means making a few trades for some utility players who can swing hot bats and perhaps give Jones or even Davis and Machado a day off (or let them DH for a day here and there), that\xe2\x80\x99s what they should do. I mentioned Desmond Jennings sitting on a fastball above. I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed that Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pitching can be somewhat predictable, and that sequence really proves that premise. Desmond had recorded two strikes on breaking pitches, and he knew that 1-2 was a fastball count. Given that the Orioles seem to be a pretty by-the-book team, he knew he could sit on that fastball.In no way does it come across as a bad thing to have players who want to play everyday. However at a certain point, the toils of the grind catch up with players. Even the great Cal Ripken Jr. only hit .151 over the course of his career in September (and October). However nobody really noticed because the team was out of contention for much of that time. When you\xe2\x80\x99re in contention for the post season and your players start suffering from fatigue (making them predictable/one-dimensional), it tends to stick out a lot more. The Birds are a team of all-stars and gold glovers, yet at a certain point the fatigue factor catches up to you. The fact that Danny Valencia, who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played everyday and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even been with the team for 50 games this season, has been the hottest hitter of late is probably no coincidence.The Orioles will need wins this afternoon and Monday to salvage a series split with Tampa, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll send Scott Feldman to the mound this afternoon in hopes of a victory. Tampa has had to shuffle their rotation with Jeremy Hellickson having pitched in relief on Friday/Saturday morning, and thus Roberto Hernandez will take to the mound against Feldman and the Birds today.

Hair dryers could be heard at full throttle from the bathroom. Monday was a travel date, and after being swept by the Tampa Bay Rays, the Orioles packed up in mostly stunned silence and disbelief.\xe2\x80\x9cThis game can be real cold,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said.This loss hurt Baltimore far beyond the 5-4 score. Third baseman Manny Machado sustained a potentially serious injury to his left knee as the leg appeared to buckle as he stepped on first running out a single. He was carried off the field on a stretcher. Second baseman Alexi Casilla crashed into right fielder Nick Markakis while diving to catch a bloop hit, a scary collision that left Casilla with a possible concussion.If that was not enough, the Orioles were all but mathematically eliminated from the American League wild-card chase when James Loney homered to lead off the bottom of the ninth and seal the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 win. Loney, the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 regular starting first baseman, was summoned as a pinch-hitter and blasted an 0-1 pitch from Tommy Hunter into the right-field seats.The Rays raced to home to greet Loney and celebrate a four-game sweep that put them a game ahead of the Cleveland Indians for the A.L.\xe2\x80\x99s top wild-card spot.

He will rest the knee until the swelling subsides and then go through a light rehabilitative program.""The MCL is fine, the ACL is fine,"" Orioles head trainer Richie Bancells said. ""All those major ligaments are fine. This is a smaller ligament.""The injury occurred Monday during Baltimore\'s game at Tampa Bay. Machado was running out a single and stepped awkwardly on the inside of the base. He tumbled to the ground and had to be taken off the field on a stretcher.The Orioles feared Machado tore his ACL, which would have kept him sidelined into the 2014 season.""I was relieved because it\'s a good report,"" said Dan Duquette, executive vice president of baseball operations. ""If everything falls into place like we think, this is something he could recover from with rest. Of course, he\'s out for the rest of the season, but he will be able to come back and play next year.""The 21-year-old Machado had played in every game this season and was an integral part of team\'s success. He\'s batting .283 with 14 homers, 71 RBIs and 51 doubles.Machado\'s teammates were horrified when he fell to the ground Monday.""To see a kid that young to go through what he went through at the end of such a phenomenal season, my heart broke for him,"" second baseman Brian Roberts said. ""He\'ll be back 100 percent, no doubt in my mind. Coming back, it\'s not a matter of if, it\'s a matter of when. Certainly, he\'s got age of his side. He\'s got a lot of great things going for him, and hopefully he comes back better than he\'s ever been. At the time, though, it was demoralizing for all of us.""The news that the injury was far less severe than expected was met with relief in the clubhouse and throughout the organization. Machado, a former No. 1 draft pick, has been an integral part in the Orioles\' high quality of play over the past two seasons.""It\'s good news for the clubhouse,"" manager Buck Showalter said.

They could have claimed the park changed the facilities of all sports. After all, never before had a modern-day venue featured such a gorgeous yesteryear look or as many ways to generate revenue.COUNTDOWN: No. 10 -- Marlins ParkThe story of the Orioles and their ballparks is long and uneven. For 52 seasons, they toiled as the St. Louis Browns. In 31 of those seasons, they finished last in the American League in attendance, including the lowest single-season total in big-league history, 80,922 in 1935.Tired of being in the Cardinals\' shadow, they fled to Baltimore and changed their name to the Orioles in 1954. They played at Memorial Stadium for the next 38 seasons, failing to top 1.3 million in attendance until 1979. It peaked at 2,552,753 in the Orioles\' final season at Memorial Stadium in 1991.The team had been lobbying for a new park for years by the time Camden Yards was completed in 1992. Architecture firm HOK, now called Populous, had initially pushed a modern design for the park. Janet Marie Smith, who oversaw last winter\'s $100 million makeover of Dodger Stadium, relayed the Orioles\' preferences to HOK.Smith says the Orioles\' goal was for the park to be more like the classic ballparks of the early 1900s \xe2\x80\x94 ""constructed of steel trusses with a brick facade, an asymmetrical playing field, small foul territory (and) green slated chairs.""""The decision to preserve the 100-year-old B&O warehouse gave instant imagery to the goal of creating an old-fashioned look,"" she says.Joe Spear, a senior principal at Populous, headed the design effort for HOK. He agrees incorporating the 1,116-foot-long warehouse was vital, saying, ""It has resulted in an instantly recognizable backdrop for the ballpark and provides a strong sense of tradition and intimacy.""The park\'s impact is immeasurable. As Spear put it, ""(It) was the start of a new train of thought ... about ballpark design that has influenced nearly every ballpark that came after it.""***GALLERY: MLB\'S 30 BALLPARKSFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInA trip through all 30 MLB stadiums\xc2\xa0FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Oriole Park was a baseball-only, low-rise facility with sharp angles and fans close to the action, like the parks built a century ago.FAN AMENITIESAs the ballpark was nearing its 20th birthday in 2012, the team\'s ownership was eager to keep the park relevant to fans while still celebrating the rich history of the Orioles, Smith says. Changes made before last season included a new bar on top of the batter\'s-eye wall, a new restaurant called Dempsey\'s Brew Pub, wider seats in many sections and the addition of bronze statues of Orioles greats.In addition, kitchen facilities were significantly improved, allowing additional concession offerings throughout the park.Examples are the Triple Crown Sandwich, which combines a hot dog, bacon on a stick and pulled pork, and The Walk Off, which features sausage with crab dip on a pretzel roll.THE FUTUREThe Orioles are 22 years into a 30-year lease, and with all of the improvements made at the 20-year mark, the team will no doubt play here long after the end of that lease.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com'), ('Orioles: Disappointment in Every Direction? - Birds Watcher', 'As I begin this piece and start to sort out a thousand ideas surrounding the Baltimore Orioles and this last week of the season, I know the most difficult thing over these next several paragraphs will be to not go too deeply into off season analysis.September\xe2\x80\x99s hunt for an orange October did now go well at all. The statistics I\xe2\x80\x99ll not repeat \xe2\x80\x93 they are difficult to view and rehearse, even as they are almost unimaginable not terribly long ago.So Orioles fans: How you doin\xe2\x80\x99 / how you feeling?

But I\xe2\x80\x99m not angry, that is for sure. And maybe some of that is due to my renewed perspective that it is just a game at the end of the day \xe2\x80\x93 a perspective resultant from being blind-sided with a life-threatening experience with pulmonary emboli last week. (The hospital I was in for five nights did not even get the Orioles on TV, so I missed seeing some of the worst of all that went down!)Sep 23, 2013; St. Petersburg, FL, USA; Tampa Bay Rays left fielder Sean Rodriguez (1) forces out Baltimore Orioles third baseman Manny Machado (13) during the first inning at Tropicana Field. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsSome weeks from now, Orioles fans will look back to the 18-inning loss to Tampa Bay as the critical moment of the season where it was lost (though I\xe2\x80\x99d look back to Arizona).\xc2\xa0 That was a difficult game for sure; and then to see Manny Machado go down the next day \xe2\x80\xa6 ugh, what next?\xc2\xa0 Well, it would be better that Manny\xe2\x80\x99s knee joint never bent that direction; but, as a long-time track and distance coach, knees are something I know about. And this diagnosis on Manny is far, far from devastating \xe2\x80\x93 especially at the end of the season. It\xe2\x80\x99s also great to be only 21 years old! I am actually amazed that there are not more injuries on bases, especially with ankles.And in a strange way, I\xe2\x80\x99m actually pleased that if the Orioles were not to make the playoffs, the end of the season went down as it did with the loss of offense, even as the pitching improved. Again, trying to not get ahead of myself here, but the Orioles have more items to work on than just getting a couple of starting pitchers. This mantra from Orioles fans of needing more quality starters really wears on me as an over-simplistic analysis. There is no doubt that the Orioles need to have more starters who will be able to go deeper into games. But that is not the whole answer. The failures of clutching hitting and the untimely bullpen meltdowns are, in my opinion and in the final analysis, as much of a factor as starting pitching defects. Only the defense escapes scrutiny, though it raises the question to be discussed later, \xe2\x80\x9cHow far does the greatest defense EVER take a baseball team?\xe2\x80\x9dAll of this is to say that, when trying to analyze the Orioles at this point as they finish the final week and spread out to off season destinations, it is like the Facebook relationship status: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s complicated.\xe2\x80\x9dThe fact is at this moment that this is not a playoffs caliber team. Maybe with some good fortune and more timely hitting or pitching they could have squeaked in, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they should be there. They are a better than average baseball team with a lot of exciting pieces around which to build.And that is how I\xe2\x80\x99ll end this wee rant. This team has some exciting players and great potential. I would not have expected them to be a playoffs team this year, and I certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t last year. Next year \xe2\x80\x93 yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m expecting it.

09/26/2013,"[('Baltimore Orioles: This game has unwritten codes', 'Everyone by now undoubtedly knows what happened last night between Atlanta and Milwaukee. Furthermore, everyone who reads this column \xe2\x80\x93 normally about the Baltimore Orioles \xe2\x80\x93 religiously knows my stance on unwritten codes of baseball. If you\xe2\x80\x99re not familiar with my views on that, basically\xe2\x80\xa6they exist, and players need to respect them. Milwaukee\xe2\x80\x99s Carlos Gomez broke a big time unwritten rule in the first inning of last night\xe2\x80\x99s game when he stood and admired his home run shot (and yelled and gestured towards the pitcher). Gomez claims that he was intentionally hit back in June, and this was his \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation.\xe2\x80\x9dCourtesy of USA TodayNot only did Gomez do that, but he hot dogged all around the bases. This is not only disrespectful to the opponent, but to the foundation of the game itself. Furthermore, Gomez didn\xe2\x80\x99t do any of this for himself or the \xe2\x80\x9chave fun\xe2\x80\x9d (not that having fun is a reason to disrespect the game). He did it to purposely show up the opposing team.Speaking for myself, I respect what Atlanta catcher Brian McCann did in blocking the plate so Gomez couldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch it. The run was credited to Atlanta anyways because it was ruled interference, however you can\xe2\x80\x99t allow your team or your teammate to be disrespected in that manner. Furthermore, while the umpires probably should have ejected McCann, they opted not to do so. That\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly telling to me, and it really shows where justice lies in this situation. Those umpires saw what Gomez did, and they had to have thought in the backs of their minds that he was violating an unwritten rule. So in not ejecting McCann, they indirectly justified his actions. In effect, the fight was caused by Gomez, not McCann.Perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s reading a bit too much into the situation, however the fact remains that baseball has unwritten rules more so than any other sport. If you choose not to respect them like that, you or one of your teammates will pay the price. On top of all of that, Atlanta has a lot more to lose in this situation than does Milwaukee. If someone ends up getting suspended, that puts a huge tax on Atlanta as they head into post season play next week.I can\xe2\x80\x99t sit here and list all of the unwritten codes, but fans are smart enough to know that admiring your shot or hot dogging it around the bases like that is one of them. And ultimately we see the reaction when something like that is violated.

I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure that\xe2\x80\x99s fair to the team, however people are entitled to their opinions. Nevertheless, with last night\xe2\x80\x99s 9-5 win over Toronto the Birds clinched their second consecutive winning season by reaching 82 wins. Some people might say that\xe2\x80\x99s merely a formality that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t vouch for too much, especially in the absence of a post season birth. However put into the context of 14 consecutive losing seasons, I would submit that it\xe2\x80\x99s an important feat. You\xe2\x80\x99re still sitting at home in October with everyone else, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t have quite as far to go as they do in order to put yourself into the playoffs next year.Bud Norris made what will end up being his final start of 2013, only sticking around for four innings. Norris\xe2\x80\x99 line: 4 IP, 7 H, 3 R, 2 BB, 5 K. On a side note, the end of the season will probably bring an opportunity for Norris to catch his breath. Norris of course was traded to the Orioles from Houston in July when the Astros were in Baltimore, and was immediately thrust into a pennant race. Nevertheless, Buck Showalter altered his lineup last night, giving a few players some well-needed time off. Jason Pridie was called up from Norfolk and started in center field in place of Adam Jones, Steve Clevenger started behind the plate in place of Matt Wieters, Steve Pearce started at first base (with Davis DHing), and Jonathan Schoop made his big league debut at second base (more on that later on).Toronto took an early 3-0 lead on Norris and the Orioles, however Oriole bats suddenly came alive for the first time in awhile. Schoop recorded his first major league hit on a grounder up the middle, which was followed by a Ryan Flaherty home run out onto Eutaw St. The Birds tied the game in the last of the fourth with a home run by Pearce, and suddenly we had a dog fight. The last of the fifth brought RBI by Nick Markakis, Chris Davis, and Jason Pridie, and the Birds led 6-3.After Toronto netted a run back in the sixth, Jonathan Schoop continued his night of firsts by clubbing his first major league home run in the last of the inning. He would later walk in the eighth and Ryan Flaherty followed with his second home run of the game, and the Birds ran away with it 9-5. Over the past few weeks I feel that the Orioles had probably become a very predictable team, partly due in part to guys being so dead tired. Toronto looked like they expected the same predictable Orioles last night, however instead what they got were well-rested young guys who were trying to make an impact at the big league level. Furthermore, I suspect that when the likes of Adam Jones, Matt Wieters, et al return to the lineup (presumably tonight), they might be a bit more spry after having some rest.Courtesy of USA TodayThis is not a conviction of the Orioles, Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s lineups, or anything else. However as MASN\xe2\x80\x99s Jim Palmer said during the game, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will probably need to beef up their secondary players this off season. But that\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation we can have sometime after this Sunday. The act of being over .500 for the season may not equal a post season birth, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something on which to build for 2014.

', 'birdswatcher.com'), (""Orioles 3, Blue Jays 2: O's continue winning games after ..."", "" After being officially eliminated from the playoffs, the Orioles have decided to start playing some decent baseball again. Thursday night's game against the Blue Jays did not feature quite the same amount of offense as did the previous night, but they scored enough that they notched a narrow win thanks to a strong start by Miguel Gonzalez. The O's won the game, 3-2. The final start of the season for Gonzalez was a good one, with him surrendering only two hits and a walk in the seven innings he pitched, while striking out five. The only run that he allowed was unearned due to a botched routine catch by Jason Pridie, who was playing left field. He ends the season with a 3.78 ERA, not as good as his numbers last year, but more than good enough to see him continuing to be a part of the O's rotation for another year. Perhaps against a better team with more to play for, the O's might have had problems. There were few good hitters to be found in the Toronto lineup and it showed in how they performed. Still, part of baseball is keeping the bad teams from scoring runs too. The game still counts, giving the O's their 83rd win of the season. It was another one of those games where the O's got some early runs and then went to sleep for the remainder of the game. Had Jim Johnson blown his tenth save to send the O's either into extra innings or down in flames, no one would have been surprised. However, they held on, despite a shaky appearance in the eighth inning by Tommy Hunter, who let the Jays score a run to bring the game back to a 3-2 score, and had men on second and third with only one out before bearing down to strike out the final two batters of the inning.    Rather than blow a save, Johnson instead pitched a scoreless ninth for his 48th save of the season. He allowed one hit and the runner never moved beyond first base. Two ground balls and a strikeout ended the game.    That early offense came from unlikely sources. The Jays held a 1-0 lead after the Pridie error, which Matt Wieters erased in the bottom of the second inning with a solo home run. The home run was his 22nd of the season, one shy of his career high with four games left to play. The other two Orioles runs came in the third inning, with a rally that started with a bunt single by leadoff hitter Brian Roberts. Nick Markakis sliced a weak line drive just out of the reach of Jays left fielder Kevin Pillar, and it rolled all the way to the wall for an RBI double to give the O's a 2-1 lead. Adam Jones moved Markakis up to third with an infield single and Markakis scored on a sacrifice fly from Wieters. That was the end of scoring for the Orioles for the night.    Their runs all came against Jays starter Mark Buehrle, who had to exit the game in the fourth inning after Steve Pearce hit a line drive back to the mound that struck him on the calf. He walked off under his own power, but that will probably leave a mark. Buehrle gave up three runs on eight hits in 3.1 innings. He did not walk a batter, because the Orioles do not walk. After Buehrle left the game, the Orioles only got one more hit for the rest of the night, a single by Markakis in the fifth inning. Chad Jenkins pitched 3.2 scoreless innings and Steve Delabar pitched a scoreless eighth. Gonzalez was credited with the win in the game, raising his record on the season to 11-8 in 28 starts, with Buehrle taking the loss and falling to 12-10. A day after an impressive debut, Jonathan Schoop had a rougher second game in the big leagues. He committed a throwing error, though it was one of those balls where, had he lacked the range to glove the ball, it would have just been a base hit. Still, he muffed an easy throw. He also went 0-3 at the plate, because the Jays actually threw him off-speed pitches. Welcome to the bigs, Schoop. The final series of the year kicks off on Friday night as the Boston Red Sox, playing for home field advantage through the postseason, come into town. Scott Feldman starts the series opener for the O's, with Clay Buchholz taking the mound for the Red Sox in the 7:05 game.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Dan is in control of signing free agents, and re-signing current Orioles as well as making draft picks for the club, he joined Ed & Steve to talk about the plans for the Orioles off-season. (Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images) The Orioles will wrap up a disappointing season on Sunday missing the playoffs for the 15th time in the last 16 years. Dan\xe2\x80\x99s job of getting the Orioles back to the playoffs will really start Monday morning. The Orioles have some questions as they head into the off-season on their roster. The O\xe2\x80\x99s have many positions of need including finding a dependable 2nd baseman, a true DH, a left fielder, some starting pitching help, bullpen help, and possibly a new closer. Listen To The full Interview Below:  Dan Duquette ', 'baltimore.cbslocal.com'), (""Is this Brian Roberts' last weekend as an Oriole?"", ' I was sitting in the stands on Tuesday night watching the Orioles lose to the Blue Jays when I became very aware of the fact that these may be the last few days of Brian Roberts\' Orioles career. There are a few ways it could go for him after this year, but the truth is that his days of being an above-average baseball player are over. Even if he wants to stay in baseball, there may not be a place for him on the Orioles. No one will ever confuse Brian Roberts for Cal Ripken, but their careers do have one big similarity: for many years they were one of the only bright spots on a losing baseball team. This season is the only year of Brian\'s career in which he has played on a team with a winning record (if you don\'t count his 17 games played in 2012), and if his career IS ending, he\'ll never have a playoff appearance. There are three possible options for Roberts at the end of this season. He can re-sign with the Orioles, sign with another team, or retire from baseball. If he does sign with another team I expect it\'ll be a short lived and unsuccessful venture, much like Brady Anderson playing for the 2002 Indians. So what are the chances that the Orioles want Roberts back next season? Even Brian recognizes that they are slim. In an interview with Steve Melewski he said, ""I\'m just trying to enjoy every day that I\'ve had here and I\'ve loved all 14 or 15 years I\'ve been in the Orioles organization. Hopefully it\'s not the end, but if it is, I\'m certainly grateful for  every day I\'ve had. I\'m going to enjoy this last week and hopefully  it\'s not going to be my last week.""    It\'s hard to imagine a scenario where the Orioles need Brian Roberts in 2014. Second base will likely be one of the areas where they try to upgrade for next year, so the only possible place for him is as a bench player. And at this stage of his career he\'s not a defensive upgrade over most players and while he can still work the count in an at-bat, he\'s not much a threat to get on base. Additionally, the Orioles have Ryan Flaherty who can play above average defense at multiple positions who can fill that role, if he\'s not starting next season. If Roberts calls it a career after this weekend, I\'ll be sad. I\'ll understand, but I\'ll be sad. He\'s been an Oriole so long that he played with Ripken back in 2001. He\'s never been anything other than an Oriole, and for a stretch of five or six seasons he was one of the better second baseman and leadoff batters in the game. He was the best Oriole for most of those same seasons, and as we rooted for doomed team after doomed team, Brian brought us quite a bit of joy. I will miss him very much. If you think about it, now would be a good time for him to retire. He\'s been a major league baseball player for the team that drafted him for thirteen seasons. He\'s no longer great, but he\'s not yet terrible. He fought back from his injuries and played regularly from June 30th through the end of the season, so injury isn\'t forcing him into retirement. It can be his own decision.    Whatever happens with Brian, it was a privilege to see his brand of baseball for the last thirteen seasons. He\'ll always be one of my favorite all-time Orioles.

""I\'ve tried not to really dwell on it, but there are times when you definitely want to know what\'s next for you, when there\'s no assurance of anything you don\'t really know. You just kind of walk by faith.""The club\'s longest-tenured player has spent his entire 13-year big league career as an Oriole, many of those seasons as one of the faces of the franchise. And as the end of a four-year, $40 million contract signed before the 2010 season approaches, Roberts, who will turn 36 on Oct. 9, says he\'d like to remain an Oriole.""I would obviously love to play my whole career in one place,"" Roberts said. ""I love the guys here, I love the team. I love being around everybody. The organization has stood behind me through a lot of stuff, and now that we\'ve got this organization going in the right direction, it\'s a great place to be and a great place to be a part of. Certainly, if I had all my choices, this would be my first one."" var adSkipCounter = 0; Injuries marred much of his past four seasons. He battled multiple concussions, back and hip injuries, and missed 12 weeks earlier this season with a right hamstring injury he suffered in the third game of the regular season.Roberts entered this weekend\'s final series with Boston with 74 games played this season, his most since 2009. His ability to work counts, while mostly hitting from the No. 9 hole, has been welcome in an aggressive Orioles batting order. Entering Friday night\'s game, he had a .246/.310/.381 slash line this season.""Brian Roberts has done a nice job,"" Orioles executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette said when asked about Roberts\' future with the club. ""He\'s done a nice job being a setup hitter and showing good patience at the plate and [has] come around defensively and made some good plays. I appreciate that he\'s done, and I also appreciate the work that he does as a patient hitter, staying in proportion to the strike zone at the plate. I think that\'s a good role model for all our players.""This season was Roberts\' first taste of playing in a pennant race \xe2\x80\x94 he played in just 17 games for last year\'s playoff team, none past early July \xe2\x80\x94 and the team\'s bright future is a major reason why he wants to return.""All those 12 years of losing, this is the reason I re-signed several times,"" Roberts said. ""We thought we might get here, and it took a long time to get here, but now you want to be a part of it as long as you can.""The Orioles have positioned themselves for the future at second base with Ryan Flaherty, who started regularly at second in Roberts\' absence this season, and top position-player prospect Jonathan Schoop.""I think any organization would like to have Brian,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""We\'ll just see. \xe2\x80\xa6 There\'s a lot of variables there. Brian\'s got some good baseball ahead of him, especially if he stays healthy, which he has for an extended period of time. Every situation, the dynamic is different. You\'ve just got to let it play out and see where we are when the season\'s done.""The free-agent market for second basemen isn\'t deep. New York Yankees star Robinson Cano is seeking a 10-year, $305 million deal, a price tag that will eliminate him from several clubs\' wish lists. The remaining top free-agent alternatives are the Detroit Tigers\' Omar Infante, the Tampa Bay Rays\' Kelly Johnson and the Los Angeles Dodgers\' Mark Ellis, meaning Roberts could receive significant interest on the open market.But Roberts said money is secondary to the chance to stay in Baltimore, where he has lived for the past eight years and planted roots with his wife, Diana, and baby boy Jax Isaac, who was born in August. He indicated that he\'s open to an incentive-laden deal.""At this point in my career, it\'s really going to be about what the opportunities are and where you want to be, where you want you and your family to be, and what that looks like,"" Roberts said. ""There could be a lot of factors that go into it, but money certainly won\'t be the No. 1 one.""eencina@baltsun.comtwitter.com/EddieInTheYard     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

In February, he agreed to a $6.5 million contract after leading the majors in saves with 51 (in 54 chances).Those two seasons combined, Duquette said, show that the 30-year-old Johnson is deserving of being considered part of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 core. var adSkipCounter = 0; \xe2\x80\x9cJimmy has done something historic in terms of the number of games he has saved over the last couple years.

The Orioles have been eliminated and as soon as the Athletics lost this afternoon the Red Sox had clinched home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Even without anything on the line the O's and Red Sox used five pitchers each in a game that featured multiple lead changes before the Orioles finally went ahead to stay in the bottom of the eighth inning and won 6-5. The Orioles were facing longtime nemesis Jon Lester tonight and got on the board first with solo runs in the second and third innings. In the second, Steve Pearce doubled to knock in Nick Markakis. It was the first of three RBI on the night for Pearce. And in the third inning, Brian Roberts hit his eighth home run of the year to give the O's a 2-0 lead. Wei-Yin Chen has had a lot of trouble against the Red Sox in his career, and while he didn't pitch spectacularly tonight, he held his own into the sixth inning. After the O's score two runs for him, he gave one back in the fourth inning on three singles and let the Red Sox tie the game in the fifth. Stephen Drew doubled and came in to score on a single by Dustin Pedroia. The tie didn't last long thanks to three straight singles in the bottom of the fifth inning by Adam Jones, Matt Wieters, and Danny Valencia. Wieters and Valencia each knocked in one run and the O's were on top 4-2.    Chen gave back one run in the sixth before being lifted for relief pitcher Josh Stinson with one out. Stinson got out of the sixth, but wasn't able to do so in the seventh. He gave up three hits and one run before Brian Matusz came in to stop the rally. He did not. With Pedroia on second base, Daniel Nava singled into left field to knock him in. Left fielder Jason Pridie fumbled the ball for an error but then threw Johnny Gomes out at third to end the inning. So I guess he made up for his mistake. Down by one run going into the bottom of the eighth, the O's looked like they were headed to their 78th loss of the year. With runners on first and second and one out, Pearce stepped to the plate. He did exactly what the Orioles needed and doubled down the left field line. Both runners came in to score and the Orioles were back on top. With a one-run lead, Jim Johnson came in to lock down the win. He got two quick outs before Mike Napoli singled to extend the game. Pinch runner Quintin Berry stole second, but it didn't matter as JJ got Gomes to strike out looking to end the game.    Last game of the season tomorrow!

Maybe both.Back-to-back winning years after 14 straight losing ones signals hope for the futureSeptember 28, 2013|Peter SchmuckThe Orioles raised the bar a season ago and will still be looking up at it when they close out their second consecutive winning season against the playoff-bound Boston Red Sox on Sunday. The only question left is how you should feel about that.Is any season that falls short of the playoffs a disappointment? Or is there still some perspective \xe2\x80\x94 or even pride \xe2\x80\x94 to be derived from the fact that the Orioles spent 14 straight years wandering through the sub-.500 wilderness before re-emerging as a legitimate contender during their magical 2012 campaign?""I think both \xe2\x80\x94 proud that we fought, proud that we were in it until the last eight to 10 games of the season,"" center fielder Adam Jones said. ""I think that\'s something to say, that we battled and grinded all year to put ourselves in the situation. It was a long time coming, after a lot of summer vacations spent away from Camden Yards, because there is good baseball being played. var adSkipCounter = 0; ""Disappointed, yeah, because we didn\'t play well down the stretch when it mattered most, but they (the fans) were behind us.""It will certainly be remembered by the accounting department as a successful season. The Orioles enjoyed another significant rise in attendance as well as improvements in television ratings, advertising volume and ballpark revenues. It will also be remembered for the on-field heroics of Chris Davis, Manny Machado and Jones, whose names have been prominent on the league leader sheet all year.""I think there were a lot of good things in this season,\'\' said baseball operations chief Dan Duquette. ""The feedback I\'m getting from the fans is that they\'re happy that we had another winning season, of course, and they had a chance to see a couple of emerging stars in Davis and Machado. I think they see there is plenty of hope for the future. We have a pretty solid pitching staff and a good core group of players.""Still, the way the offense sputtered in September left just about everyone \xe2\x80\x94 from the clubhouse to the stands \xe2\x80\x94 frustrated that the Orioles could not take the next step after reaching the American League Division Series last October. Twelve months after manager Buck Showalter was extolled as the Earl Weaver-like savior of the Oriole Way, a lot of grumpy social media types and talk show callers are convinced that he somehow lost his magic touch.The reality is that Showalter pushed a lot of the same buttons this year and didn\'t get the same results. The Orioles bullpen was almost impermeable in 2012. It would have been highly unusual to get that level of combined performance two seasons in a row, and even moreso to duplicate the club\'s otherworldly record in one-run and extra-inning games, but that was the standard by which this year\'s team was doomed to be judged.To their credit, the players have made no excuses and continue to say they welcome the raised expectations that also will follow them into 2014.""Obviously, we\'re disappointed,\'\' said shortstop J.J. Hardy. ""It\'s not what we wanted. We come to spring training expecting to make the playoffs, wanting to make the playoffs, but there are 30 teams and not all of them get to go. We were still playing for something with six games left in the season. We still had a chance, that\'s better than not playing for anything at the beginning of August. I think we have a good team here. We\'re going to continue to have a good team. We\'re going to continue to compete and try to get to the playoffs every year. I can\'t tell you how I think the fans should view it, but I hope they see us out here grinding.""If the O\'s could not replicate the scrappy nature of last year\'s playoff team, it was not for lack of effort. If the offense fizzled down the stretch, it probably was because they were trying too hard to make good things happen and their aggressiveness was exploited too well by the strong pitching they faced at crunch time.Jones said he hopes during the club\'s Fan Appreciation Celebration that the feeling is mutual.""I think the fan base should be appreciative that we grinded our tails off,\'\' Jones said. ""We\'re bringing back baseball here in Baltimore. We\'re trying to bring back winning baseball \xe2\x80\x94 and not just here and there \xe2\x80\x94 but back-to-back winning seasons says something about the job our team has been doing. Now, we go back the drawing board and figure out how to get better and better. I think this offseason is going to be exciting because the fans see the potential that we have here.

Photo: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY SportsLet\xe2\x80\x99s review the last couple of weeks\xe2\x80\x99 worth of goings on.It\xe2\x80\x99s over.Even by Yogi Berra\xe2\x80\x98s standards, it\xe2\x80\x99s over.It was realistically over when the Baltimore Orioles lost four straight to Tampa Bay at Tropicana Field last weekend. It was mathematically over Tuesday night, the result of a loss to Toronto combined with Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s walk-off win over Chicago.Twenty-one consecutive games in which the Orioles scored five or fewer runs, beginning on September 2 and ending with Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 9-5 binge victory, had a lot to do with what will go down as The Lost September, even though they followed that 9-run sign of life with a well-pitched, 3-2 win in last night\xe2\x80\x99s series finale against Toronto.That gave the Orioles the season series over the Jays, going 10-9 against what was supposed to be the American League\xe2\x80\x99s best team coming out of Spring Training.Over the past 28 days entering Friday\xe2\x80\x99s game, a period that encompasses September, Chris Davis, in spite of his season total of 53 home runs, was hitting .202 with 15 RBI and 38 strikeouts;\xc2\xa0Adam Jones .224 with 11 RBI and 27 strikeouts;\xc2\xa0Nick Markakis .242 with 6 RBI; and Manny Machado only .196 up until his knee injury. That\xe2\x80\x99s courtesy of baseballreference.com.Orioles fans will remember Davis\xe2\x80\x99 spectacular year for a long time, as well as Machado\xe2\x80\x99s historic first half and superlative defense. Jones had a good year pockmarked by the issue of not talking walks. But the whole story is the uncanny way in which great individual stats belied the mediocre, team game they played. Don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go as far as mediocre? How does inconsistent grab you, since it had some high points, too?The well-documented problems of hitting with runners in scoring position were as pronounced as the individual numbers were good. The well-documented issues of never winning more than five in a row and never sweeping a series \xe2\x80\x93 and being swept in some \xe2\x80\x93 constantly held the team back. Being swept at home by San Diego in May stands out, as does dropping three heartbreakers in a row at Arizona in the road trip after the All Star Break. Two blown saves and a come-from-ahead loss.It was usually difficult to say whether the hitting or pitching was the problem, but they both were, in turn, at the most inconvenient times. For most one-run losses, the lineup could be blame for that runner-in-scoring-position issue, thus leading to the game being that tight in the 8th or 9th inning. Jim Johnson\xe2\x80\x98s nine blown saves are something analysts, both professional and amateur, will always point to and probably be right. Executive Vice President for Baseball Operations Dan Duquette announced this week the Orioles will offer Johnson a contract in the offseason, answering a lot of fans\xe2\x80\x99 desire to wave JJ bye-bye.That still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t eliminate the possibility he\xe2\x80\x99d leave or not accept the offer. Another team may offer him a better deal, but that would not be counted on to happen coming off those blown saves.We\xe2\x80\x99ll deal with some more of the problems pretty soon, but I vote to watch the last two games against the Red Sox, see if there are good points to take from them, and look back at finishing over .500 for the second straight year.I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking of the season in the past tense, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s not over, because the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 playoff chances are. The final weekend series with Boston is a time to show some signs of life and play for pride, and the team certainly had the same amount of it as always last night, even though the results weren\xe2\x80\x99t there for Scott Feldman.

Gold glove awards?\xe2\x80\xa6who knows?!

Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that this team wasn\xe2\x80\x99t officially eliminated from playoff contention until Tuesday evening, so they\xe2\x80\x99re still used to fighting and scrapping. Wei-Yin Chen provided mixed results in his final start of the season; he looked fairly good, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it out of the sixth inning. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5.1 IP, 9 H, 3 R, 1 BB, 5 K. However the star of the night was Steve Pearce, who had a career game. His RBI-double in the last of the second scored Nick Markakis, and gave the Birds a 1-0 lead. One inning later Brian Roberts hit what could be his last home run as an Oriole, and the Birds led 2-0. Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 contract is of course up after the season, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear what the future holds for him. These are all things that will be discussed here on Birds Watcher in the coming weeks.Boston put two RBI-singles up in the fourth and fifth innings to tie the score, however Matt Wieters and Danny Valencia followed suit with RBI-singles of their own in the last of the fifth and suddenly the O\xe2\x80\x99s had a 4-2 lead. In a back-and-forth affair like this, a two-run lead could be considered pretty big. However Boston put one across in the sixth before Daniel Nava gave them a brief lead in the seventh. Jonny Gomes\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-single had tied the game, and Nava\xe2\x80\x99s single in effect gave them the lead. However he was not credited with an RBI, as Jason Pridie dropped the ball in left field after letting it bounce. That allowed a run to score, although it also allowed the Orioles to throw Nava out on the base paths.So when you have a playoff team against a spoiler and the playoff team takes the lead late, that\xe2\x80\x99s generally the end, right? But these are the Fighting Showalters we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, and they always play until the final out. Back-to-back singles by Matt Wieters (who was lifted for pinch-runner Nate McLouth) and Danny Valencia put two runners on for the Orioles. Steve Pearce cameCourtesy of: Joy R. Absalon-USA TODAY Sportsthrough once again for a two-RBI double, and the Orioles had a 6-5 lead. Jim Johnson allowed one base runner in the ninth, before getting into a 3-1 count to Jonny Gomes. He appeared ready to head to first base, however to his surprise the pitch was called strike two. MASN\xe2\x80\x99s pitch track backed up the fact that it was in the strike zone, and the same was true of the 3-2 pitch, on which Gomes was rung up to end the game.With the victory, the Orioles stretched their record against Boston on the year to 10-8 which guarantees them a winning record against the BoSox in 2013. That\xe2\x80\x99s a small consolation given that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to the post season, however it\xe2\x80\x99s something. The O\xe2\x80\x99s held their own against Boston and Toronto, however they struggled against New York and Tampa, which is one of the reasons why they\xe2\x80\x99ll be at home after tomorrow. When you\xe2\x80\x99re as close as the Orioles were this season, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to say\xc2\xa0a bounce the other way here, or a roll there\xe2\x80\xa6but it\xe2\x80\x99s really beside the point.The biggest reason the Orioles faded in September is because of the bats being inconsistent. (And please note that I used the term faded in September. I\xe2\x80\x9dve seen some writers call this an epic meltdown, similar to the 2011 BoSox. Nothing could be further from the truth in my view.) As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, that\xe2\x80\x99s due in large part to the fact that a lot of guys were tired; the O\xe2\x80\x99s have five players (including Manny Machado, who\xe2\x80\x99s going to see Dr. James Andrews) that played over 150 games this year. This is something we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss as we get into the off season here on Birds Watcher, however it should come as no surprise that Steve Pearce was the guy who provided the clutch hit last night. He\xe2\x80\x99s a guy who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played everyday, and thus has a lot more rest and less mileage under his belt than Jones, Markakis, et al.The Orioles have played 161 games, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll close this series with Boston and the 2013 season this afternoon at Camden Yards. After much discussion, the Orioles will send Chris Tillman out to the mound one final time today, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by John Lackey. The Orioles have a record of 84-77, so even a victory in their final game won\xe2\x80\x99t reach my prediction of 89 wins. However it would serve as a spring board for the fights yet to come in 2014. But that\xe2\x80\x99s another story for another day. As the 2013 Orioles move to the end of the line, they only hope to get there on a positive note. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

The Orioles finished 85-77 -- one game back in the local bragging rights division.Round One goes to Washington.
